					14:11 CEST+02:00				",AFP,Germany steps up migrant deportations to North Africa,"Germany has boosted the number of repatriations of rejected asylum seekers to Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia, the government said Monday, following years of diplomatic pressure on the Maghreb states.
""We have managed to improve cooperation with these countries, which has resulted in a rise of repatriations,"" said an Interior Ministry spokesman.
Between 2015 and last year, repatriations from the biggest EU economy to Algeria rose from 57 to 504, he said. To Morocco, they increased from 61 to 634, and to Tunisia from 17 to 251 over the same period.
Immigration and refugee flows became a flashpoint issue in Germany after Chancellor Angela Merkel decided in 2015 to keep borders open to a mass influx of people fleeing war and misery, half of them from Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan.
The move earned her praise from liberal commentators but also sparked a xenophobic backlash that a year ago saw the far-right and anti-Islam Alternative for Germany (AfD) enter parliament for the first time.
Public fears have been heightened by several jihadist attacks - especially a 2016 truck rampage through a Berlin Christmas market that killed 12 and was attributed to Tunisian rejected asylum seeker Anis Amri.
Germany has since pushed hard to reduce migrant flows, especially of those deemed to be fleeing poverty rather than conflict.
Bild daily quoted unnamed German security sources saying that ""intensive negotiations"" had improved cooperation with the Maghreb states, especially in exchanging biometric data to identify deportees and issue them new travel documents.
Merkel's government has also repeatedly tried to add the three North African states to its list of ""safe countries of origin"", which would vastly raise the hurdles for asylum requests by its citizens.
However, passage of the bill into law has been blocked in the upper house by states ruled by the left-leaning Greens party, which argues the Maghreb nations - Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia, cannot be considered ""safe"" as long as journalists, gay people and other minority groups are targets of state persecution there."

					18:32 CEST+02:00				",AFP,Hooligans ‘attack migrants’ in Chemnitz after stabbing at city festival,"Chancellor Angela Merkel on Monday condemned far-right protesters who were ""hunting down"" foreigners in street mobs following the killing of a German man, allegedly by a Syrian and an Iraqi.
The far-right movement PEGIDA called for demonstrations for a second straight day after a gathering of around 800 people in the city of Chemnitz in the country's ex-communist east degenerated into violent chaos, forcing police to call in reinforcements.
Several media outlets, including the Bild tabloid, reported that some demonstrators Sunday had shouted ""we are the people"", ""get lost"" and ""you're not welcome here"" at those they took to be immigrants.
Prosecutors said Monday that police had arrested a 23-year-old Syrian man and an Iraqi man, 22, on suspicion they had stabbed to death the 35-year-old German man in an altercation in the early hours of Sunday.
""The investigation, especially into the motive, the details of the crime and the murder weapon continue,"" they said in a brief statement.
In the far-right riots that followed, some protesters used bottles to attack foreign-looking people, freelance journalist Johannes Grunert, who reports frequently on the far-right scene, told Spiegel Online.
Merkel's spokesman Steffen Seibert stressed Berlin's strong condemnation of the violent protests.
""Such riotous assemblies, the hunting down of people who appear to be from different backgrounds or the attempt to spread hate in the streets, these have no place in our country,"" he said.
Asked about an apparent call by an MP from the far-right AfD party for vigilante action, Seibert warned that it is the legal system that delivers justice in a constitutional democracy.
AfD lawmaker Markus Frohnmaier had written on Twitter: ""If the state can no longer protect the citizen, then people will go on the streets and protect themselves.""
Protest, counter-protest
In the violent altercation at 3am Sunday, on the sidelines of a street festival, two other men, aged 33 and 38, were hospitalised with severe
injuries, police said.
After the street demonstrations that followed on Sunday, Chemnitz mayor Barbara Ludwig said that ""if I look at what has happened here on Sunday, I'm horrified"".
""The fact that people can agree to meet... run through town and threaten people is bad,"" she told regional broadcaster MDR.
As outrage grew over the scenes of xenophobic violence by the mostly male protesters, left-leaning activists called for a counter-protest on Monday in the city, hours before PEGIDA supporters were due to gather.
In its call for a demonstration at 6:30 pm (1630 GMT), PEGIDA's Chemnitz and West Saxony regional chapter said: ""Muster strength from anger and sadness! Only together can we ensure that his death was not pointless.""
Saxony state has become a hotspot for racist hate crimes, as misgivings run deep in the region against the arrival of more than a million asylum seekers to Germany since 2015.
The state is also the birthplace of the Islamophobic PEGIDA movement, which is linked to the AfD -- a party that has scooped up voters who blame Merkel for the migrant influx.
Surveys suggest the AfD is on track to become the second biggest party in Saxony when regional elections are held there next year.
Results of last year's general election showed that in Chemnitz itself the AfD has as many voters as Merkel's centre-right CDU."

					17:07 CEST+02:00				",DPA/The Local,One in every four German residents now has migrant background,"Just under a quarter of residents of the Bundesrepublik have foreign roots, up 4.4 percent year-on-year, government statistics show.
The figures released by destatis on Wednesday show that roughly 19.3 million of Germany’s population had a migrant background in 2017. The number was a record high.
Someone is considered to have a migrant background if they or at least one parent was born without German citizenship.
Petra Bendel, a political scientist at Erlangen University, said that migration from within the EU was again the major driver of growth in the foreign population after two years in which refugees made up the largest number of newcomers.
“Germany needs immigrants due to the demographic changes taking place,” she stated.
Of the 19.3 million people with a migrant background, 14 percent have roots in Turkey, followed by 11 percent in Poland and seven percent in Russia.
The microcensus also looked of the first time at the primary language spoken in German homes. It found that in 10 percent of the 24 million households in the country a language other than German was spoken.
The statistics were extrapolated from a micro-census which was undertaken in a select number of German households.
Bendel said that it was important that Germans learned to accept people with other ethnic backgrounds as more than just “passport Germans”.
She said that a new social movement called #MeTwo which aims to bring attention to the subject of racism in daily life, highlighted the fact that people in the country could have more than one identity."

					14:29 CEST+02:00				",AFP,'We aren't all Nazis': Chemnitz on edge after anti-migrant violence,"Chemnitz is uneasy after a wave of racist violence following the deadly stabbing of a local man, allegedly by two migrants, stoking tension and tarnishing the eastern German city's image.
""We aren't all Nazis,"" sighs 60-year old pharmacist Rita Thal.
""Everything people are seeing and hearing about Chemnitz, it doesn't reflect reality,"" she tells AFP while queuing outside the city's football stadium where Michael Kretschmer, head of the eastern state of Saxony, was to hold a town hall-style meeting.
Although the event had long been in the diary, it took on a new urgency after a week in which black-clad far-right demonstrators attacked foreigners and clash with police and counter-protesters.
Around 500 people packed into a stuffy hall inside the grounds to hear Kretschmer, while outside, another 800 or so gathered for a demonstration organized by Pro Chemnitz - a radical right-wing movement with three seats on the city council.
Distant cries of ""Get out!"" directed at the state premier filter through the windows and the mood inside is tense.
In Chemnitz, like in many other towns and cities, there is a simmering anger over crimes committed by migrants which have been given a high profile in the media, stoking concern about the integration of more than one million people who have arrived since 2015.
Sunday's stabbing is just the latest incident, but in Chemnitz they are demanding answers.
'Not a brown town'
As mayor Barbara Ludwig of the centre-left Social Democratic Party (SPD) takes to the stage, she bears the brunt of the anger, with a chorus of booing interrupting her speech as she struggles to make herself heard.
""In Chemnitz, we're wavering between love and hate,"" she declares.
Kretschmer also seeks to reassure the crowd.
""This is not a far-right town, this town is not brown,"" he insisted, referring to the traditional colour of fascism and the Nazi party.
Nevertheless, he acknowledged that images of the mob giving Hitler salutes with their right arm outstretched in front of police too few in number to stop them, have been seen ""around the world"" on television and social media.
During the communist regime of the German Democratic Republic (GDR), the city was known as Karl-Marx-Stadt, but following reunification in 1990, its industries fell into disrepair, like in many other towns in eastern Germany's so-called ""new states"".
Since then, however, the city centre has been spruced up with green spaces established, buildings renovated and theatres and museums opening their doors.
'Lurking fear'
But for local residents, security remains the top concern.
""There's a feeling of lurking fear, especially among older people, stoked by the far right,"" explains Sabine Kühnrich, who runs a grassroots movement for democracy and tolerance.
For Birgit Menzel, a 59-year-old insurance saleswoman also at the gathering, it's not clear why people are afraid.
""Foreigners? We don't have many of them here,"" she says.
Only around seven percent of Chemnitz's population of 246,000 is foreign-born, a figure which is relatively low compared to Frankfurt or Munich where the percentage is above 25 percent.
But a man standing nearby interrupts her.
""You're talking nonsense. People are afraid, and they're right to be. I don't let my 13-year-old daughter go into town by herself,"" the shaven-headed 40-something says angrily.
""How can you say foreigners aren't a problem? Haven't you read about what's happened?"" he demands.
Another woman nods in agreement.
""If the victim had been your child, you wouldn't be reacting like this!"""

				14:33 CEST+02:00			 
					14:33 CEST+02:00				",AFP,Germany extends Austria border controls over migrants,"Germany said on Friday it was extending by another half year border controls with Austria, which were reintroduced in several places in the passport-free Schengen zone in response to the migrant influx.
German Interior Ministry spokeswoman Eleonore Petermann said the new measure would begin on November 12th and apply for six months. ""It is important to say in this context that it is still our aim to return to a Schengen without borders, without border controls,"" Petermann told reporters.
""Travel without border controls is one of the greatest achievements (of the EU). But we still see problems with the protection of the EU's external borders and we still have high numbers for illegal secondary migration"" between member states.
Since 2015, several countries in the 26-nation Schengen zone have reintroduced border controls due to the largest migrant/refugee crisis since World War II - effectively suspending its principle of open-borders travel.
EU rules say countries in exceptional circumstances can reintroduce border controls for up to two years, in periods of up to six months at a time.
Petermann said more than 7,000 people crossed the German-Austrian border illegally this year until August, of whom nearly 4,000 were turned back.
The decision was ordered by Germany's hardline Interior Minister Horst Seehofer, whose conservative party is facing a tough election in the border state of Bavaria on Sunday.
Seehofer nearly toppled Chancellor Angela Merkel's shaky coalition government over the summer with a threat to unilaterally turn back migrants at the border with Austria. Arrivals there have dropped off steeply since 2015-2016.
The dispute was resolved with a more moderate compromise plan involving bilateral agreements between Germany and EU member states.
Merkel's spokesman said Friday that Seehofer's decision on the border checks had been agreed with the rest of the government."

The rallies, which drew 8,000 people according to police, left 18 people injured (including three police officers) as the anti-migrant far-right and counter-protesters held opposing rallies in the German city of Chemnitz, which was hit by xenophobic demonstrations last week.
Far-right protesters paraded with large portraits of victims of attacks perpetrated, they claimed, by asylum-seekers.
Some chanted ""Merkel must go"" and ""We are the people"" while waving German flags.
Anti-fascist demonstrators, meanwhile, brandished banners reading ""Chemnitz is neither grey nor brown"" and ""Heart instead of hate"".
There was a heavy police presence with reinforcements from all over Germany after they were outnumbered by thousands of neo-Nazis, football hooligans and other extremists earlier this week.
Sunday and Monday evenings saw outbreaks of street violence, triggered by the arrest of one Iraqi protester and one Syrian, suspected of stabbing a 35-year-old carpenter to death.
Following the arrests, mobs launched random street attacks against people they took to be foreigners, including an Afghan, a Syrian and a Bulgarian man.
Saturday's protests drew around 4,500 far-right supporters from various movements including the far-right anti-immigration alternative for Germany (AfD) party and the anti-Islam PEGIDA movement, according to police estimates.
Another 3,500 marched in support of Merkel's immigration policy, which has seen more than one million migrants and refugees allowed into Germany since 2015.
The government lent its support to the pro-migrant rally through Foreign Minister Heiko Maas who tweeted: ""The Second World War started 79 years ago. Germany caused unimaginable suffering in Europe. If once again people are parading today in the streets making Nazi salutes, our past history forces us to resolutely defend democracy.""
""We will not let right-wing extremists destroy our country and our democracy. Neither in Chemnitz, nor in Saxony nor anywhere in Germany. Our constitution must prevail. We must defend it. Now!"" added one of the Greens' leaders Cem Ozdemir in a tweet accompanied by a picture of him with demonstrators.
The violence and heated debate on immigration have brought back to the fore what has become the most challenging political issue for Merkel, especially in the former communist east of Germany where the AfD is the number one party in some towns and regions.
Following criticism of Merkel's earlier open door policy, her government has increasingly tightened asylum laws as conservative and far-right disquiet has grown.
After an initially jubilant welcome, the migrant influx sparked a strong backlash that saw a spate of hate crimes and swept once-fringe party AfD into parliament."

If the agreement reached Monday evening is approved by the German government as a whole, ""we will be obliged to take measures to avoid disadvantages for Austria and its people,"" the Austrian government said in a statement.
It added it would be ""ready to take measures to protect our southern borders in particular,"" those with Italy and Slovenia.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel reached a compromise deal Monday on migration with her rebellious interior minister, Horst Seehofer, to defuse a bitter row that had threatened her government.
Among the proposals is a plan to send back to Austria asylum seekers arriving in Germany who cannot be returned to their countries of entry into the European Union.
Austria said it would be prepared to take similar measures to block asylum seekers at its southern borders, with the risk of a domino effect in Europe.
""We are now waiting for a rapid clarification of the German position at a federal level,"" said the statement, signed by Austria's conservative
Chancellor Sebastian Kurz and his allies of the far-right Freedom party, Vice Chancellor Heinz-Christian Strache and Interior Minister Herbert Kickl.
""German considerations prove once again the importance of a common European protection of the external borders,"" the statement said.
Kurz on Tuesday is to present before the European Parliament in Strasbourg his priorities for Austria's six-month presidency of the European Union, with the issue of migration expected to feature prominently."

					12:41 CET+01:00				",AFP,Migrant arrivals in Germany decreased sharply in 2017,"The number of new asylum seekers in Germany
fell sharply last year to 186,000, the government said on Tuesday, easing pressure on Chancellor Angela Merkel as debate rages on whether to impose a
cap on migration.
The figures are a far cry from the record 890,000 arrivals registered in 2015 after Merkel opened the country's borders to those fleeing conflict at the height of Europe's migrant crisis - a decision that polarized the country.
Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere said the number of newcomers filing asylum requests had ""dropped significantly"" in 2017 to 186,644, after already falling to some 280,000 the year before.
Refugees from war-torn Syria made up the largest group of asylum seekers in 2017 with more than 47,000 arrivals, followed by some 21,000 migrants from Iraq and over 12,000 from Afghanistan, according to the ministry.
The 2017 data will make welcome reading for Merkel, as it falls below the maximum intake of 200,000 refugees a year sought by her conservative CSU sister party.
Their insistence on a migration cap has been a key stumbling block in tortuous talks between Merkel's centre-right CDU/CSU bloc and the centre-left Social Democrats (SDP) on forming another coalition government.
A preliminary agreement reached by the parties last Friday mentioned an upper limit of around 200,000, angering many in the SPD base.
Germany's migrant arrivals have slowed sharply since the 2015 influx after several Balkans transit countries shuttered their borders and the EU in 2016 reached a deal with Turkey to stop crossings to Greek islands.
Initially overwhelmed by the flood of newcomers, De Maiziere said German authorities have made significant progress in processing asylum requests.
A huge backlog of some 435,000 open cases at the start of 2017 was reduced to around 68,000 by the end of the year, he said, back to pre-crisis levels.
""The federal office for migration and refugees is no longer grappling with the consequences of the crisis,"" De Maiziere told reporters in Berlin.
Germany has also become better at identifying migrants to spot potential security risks, he said, pointing to closer cooperation between migration officials and security services.
As well as being allowed to access mobile phone data, German authorities have introduced speech recognition tests to determine an asylum seeker's dialect and accent in case of doubts about their country of origin.
""This is a big win for Germany's security,"" De Maiziere said.
Voters punished Merkel for her liberal refugee policy in last September's general election, handing her party its worst result in decades.
Nearly four months on, Germany is still without a new government."

Two of them then hit him in the face before the third ""hit him on the shoulder and ribs with an iron chain"".
The victim fell to the ground and was beaten before his attackers fled. He suffered a broken nose and bruises to his face and upper body, said police who have opened an investigation.
The attack in the Baltic coastal city comes as Germany is reeling from weekend protests by right-wing extremists in the eastern state of Saxony, long a hotspot for xenophobia.
After the fatal stabbing of a German man, 35, allegedly by a Syrian and an Iraqi, thousands of far-right protesters marched in the city of Chemnitz for two straight days, some chasing down people they believed were immigrants.
Police reported assaults by extremists against at least three foreigners on Sunday, while investigations were opened in 10 cases of the protesters performing the illegal Hitler salute.
The ugly scenes of mostly white men, many of them extremist football hooligans, hurling abuse at people they deemed to be foreigners, have deeply alarmed Germany.
Saxony has been a stronghold of far-right parties and groups that bitterly oppose Chancellor Angela Merkel for her 2015 decision to keep open German borders to a mass influx of migrants and refugees.

Board member of the pilots' union Vereinigung Cockpit, Jörg Handwerg, justified the actions of pilots. If someone comes aboard who ""becomes violent and behaves aggressively, the captain has to reconsider transportation,"" he said.
Pilots are obliged by paragraph 12 of the air security law to ensure safety on board their flight.
On the other hand, German residency law dictates that airlines are legally obliged to take all rejected asylum seekers who the government wishes to deport. Pilots who refuse purely on moral grounds could face legal consequences.

""Did she really need to say it was necessary to welcome one million migrants at a time when France, which casts itself as the land of human rights, pledged to take in 30,000?"" Lagerfeld said in an interview with French weekly Le Point published Thursday.
Again dismissing Merkel as a ""pastor's daughter who can't accept the evil that Germany carried out after 1933,"" the designer accused her of fostering the emergence of the far-right Alternative for Germany party.
""The AfD didn't exist, yet with one sentence she made it exist by alienating two million voters and sending 100 of these neo-Nazis into parliament,"" he said, referring to the 92 AfD lawmakers who obtained seats in the Bundestag in last September's election.
""If this keeps up, I'll abandon German citizenship,"" Lagerfeld said, without indicating what he might trade it for, though he has gushed previously that ""a new day is dawning in France"" with the arrival of President Emmanuel Macron.
""I like Macron personally, and (his wife) Brigitte, but that doesn't mean I want to become French,"" he told Le Point.
""I don't like nations, I'm cosmopolitan. And I don't feel German either -- I'm Hanseatic,"" he said, referring to the Hanseatic League of merchant guilds across northern Germany that emerged in the 13th century.
His stance would appear to be a stark reversal from one espoused just a few months ago, when he told Madame Figaro magazine that he was ""a Kraut at heart"".
""It's in my genes and I'm fine with that. And it's not because Mrs Merkel does stupid things that I'm going to renounce being German,"" he said.
Lagerfeld had already stirred up outrage last November by evoking the Holocaust while assailing Merkel for opening Germany's borders to migrants.

The organization's decision to bar new registrants without a German ID card stirred nationwide debate on themes ranging from poverty to racism after it was widely reported across the media in Germany last month.
SEE ALSO: How a food charity has sparked a furious debate about refugees, poverty and racism
But now the ban is set to be lifted at the end of March.
“This will likely take place in two or three weeks' time,"" chairman of the Essener Tafel Jörg Sartor told the German Press Agency (DPA) on Sunday.
According to the association, the ban was planned from the outset for a temporary period of six to eight weeks - to a maximum of three months. ""The numbers have moved back towards balance. We expect to reach an acceptable ratio by the end of the month,"" Sartor said.
Essen officials agreed on Friday to get rid of the “temporary measure as soon as possible” after discussions were held with representatives from the association, other charities in Essen, as well as migrant organizations.
“Should bottlenecks in the admission of new clients arise again in the future, single parents, families with underage children and senior citizens - irrespective of their origin - will be given preference,"" the city of Essen said in a press release. In addition, the Essener Tafel will expand its core target group to include ""Essen residents over the age of 50 in transfer benefits.""
The charity, which is one among over 930 Tafel food banks across the country, took the decision in December to only accept new customers with German citizenship; since January 10th its decision has been enforced.
As to the reason behind the decision, the charity stated on its website that they felt ""compelled to ensure reasonable integration,"" adding that they had seen a recent increase in the proportion of foreign citizens among their clients.
The charity had also defended its decision, saying that roughly three quarters of the people who visited their Tafel location were foreigners. According to Sartor, this figure was too high.
The head of the charity had moreover claimed that many elderly Germans and single mothers were scared off by an increasingly aggressive atmosphere amidst a swelling number of non-Germans using the charity.
Sartor stirred controversy by saying that some migrant groups shared a ""give-me gene"" and did not understand Germany's ""queueing culture"".
His statements caused outrage among many left-wing politicians, who swiftly denounced the decision as racist.
Even Chancellor Merkel weighed in on the issue, telling broadcaster RTL that “one shouldn't make such distinctions, that's not good.”
Organizations around the country similarly criticized the charity's decision, arguing that those in need should not be banned from assistance based on their nationality.
But support for the Tafel also came from the left, with Die Linke leader Sahra Wagenknecht stating: “The real scandal is that there are conflicts over the division of old food in a country as rich as Germany.""
Following the ban, six of the food bank's delivery vans and the entrance to one of its locations were vandalized with phrases like “FCK NZI.”
The first Tafel Deutschland opened in Germany 25 years ago. Heavily reliant on volunteers, the charity collects surplus food that would otherwise be discarded by supermarkets and other businesses to prepare and serve it to the poor."

The Franco-German ministerial meeting, being held at the Meseberg castle north of Berlin, is seen as key for forging a consensus ahead of a crunch EU summit on June 28-29.
But Italy's refusal last week to allow a ship carrying 630 rescued migrants to dock on its shores has shattered the bloc's fragile status quo on dealing with the wave of people fleeing war and misery in Syria, Iraq and elsewhere since 2015.
Merkel herself is facing a showdown with her own hardline interior minister after his call for turning back undocumented migrants at German borders and speeding up ejections of rejected asylum seekers.
Most Germans support the moves according to opinion polls, while critics say Merkel's liberal migrant policies have bolstered far-right and populist parties at home and abroad.
EU deals with Turkey and Italy have sharply reduced the number of new arrivals, yet hundreds of people still attempt to cross the Mediterranean from Libya each day.
Merkel and Macron both agree on the need for a Europe-wide response, and are hoping to hammer out a policy acceptable to all member states that would ease the burden on Italy, Greece and other main entry points.
Yet the tensions that flared across Europe last week after Italy's move to block the Aquarius rescue ship have pushed any potential deal further from reach.
'Maximum of agreements'
Paris no longer harbours any illusion of securing a revamp of the so-called Dublin rules before the end-of-June deadline set by EU leaders last December.
The rules require migrants to apply for asylum in the first country they enter -- a policy France has used to defend its own efforts to keep people from trying to cross over from Italy.
But Paris is hoping to get Berlin's agreement on increased funding for the EU's Frontex border force, harmonised asylum rules and the creation of asylum processing centres in Africa.
""We're hoping to obtain a maximum of agreements on Tuesday, and in late June,"" a source in the French presidency told AFP.
That hope, however, is running up against an ""axis of the willing"" to combat immigration announced last week by Italy's new far-right interior minister and his German and Austrian counterparts.
And countries such as Hungary and Poland have either refused outright or resisted taking in refugees under an EU quota system that has essentially floundered.
Common ground?
Despite the migrant policy headache, Macron and Merkel might find more common ground on deeper EU economic integration.
Macron, a centrist who swept to power last year, pledged to reconcile Europeans with the Union after years of austerity and growing disillusionment with the bloc's institutions. Merkel has cautiously come around in recent weeks, but she may not have much political room to manoeuvre further.
Rightwingers in her delicate governing coalition -- as well as several northern European countries -- remain hostile to France's push for a common eurozone budget, fearing taxpayers could foot the bill for fiscal irresponsibility in southern EU states.
Merkel made some concessions earlier this month, agreeing to support Macron's call for an investment fund to help poorer European countries catch up in the areas of science, technology and innovation. The size of the fund remains unclear, however, with Germany resisting the hundreds of billions of euros sought by France.
Nonetheless, French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire, who will attend Tuesday's meeting along with the two countries' defence and foreign ministers, tweeted late Saturday that ""an agreement is close at hand"".
France and Germany may also strike a deal aimed at harmonising corporate taxes across the bloc, to stop multinationals from taking advantage of low-tax regimes in countries like the Netherlands, Ireland or Luxembourg.
Merkel said the common tax system would also help both countries shore up their competitiveness in the face of a potential trade war unleashed by US President Donald Trump.
Trump's threat to reduce US funding for NATO unless European members step up their contributions could also lead to new measures for strengthening EU defence cooperation.
Merkel has said she is ""favourable"" to a French call to create a European Intervention Initiative of forces which could be deployed rapidly to deal with crises outside the framework of NATO."

					15:31 CEST+02:00				", The Local,"Migrant deportations often hit the wrong people, Merkel ally warns","After a large group of migrants aggressively tried to prevent the deportation of a Togolese man this week, right-wing politicians called for mass deportations. But a senior Christian Democrat (CDU) figure said on Friday that deportations can have a bad impact on families.
“Deportations often hit the wrong people - families who have lived in Germany for an eternity and who are well integrated,” Daniel Günther, the Minister-President of Schleswig-Holstein told the Funke Media Group.
Günther, who is a key figure in Angela Merkel’s CDU made the comments in reaction to calls for more deportations of migrants after ugly scenes between African migrants and police in southern Germany.
Police arrived at the Ellwangen refugee centre in Baden-Württemburg on Monday to detain a Togolese man who was to be deported. But a group of 150-200 fellow migrants prevented the deportation by threatening the police officers.
Police are currently investigating whether the migrants had a plan to resist all attempted deportations from the centre.
The incident made national headlines and led to calls from the far-right for the government to immediately deport asylum seekers who are attempt to prevent a deportation.
Alice Weidel, co-parliamentary chair of the Alternative for Germany (AfD) claimed that “chumminess among asylum seekers is increasing, as is violent prevention of deportations - German law is being made impotent.”
On Friday Günther cautioned against making blanket statements about deportations.
“We certainly have a problem when it comes to enforcement of deportations,” he said. But he added that the problem was “highly complex.”
Günther said that the government had agreed in the coalition deal on steps to make deportations easier. New centralized asylum centres where “one can quickly assess if someone has a chance of staying or not” would improve the situation, he said.
Die Linke meanwhile said that the actions of the migrants in Ellwangen were a sign of solidarity which should not be condemned too harshly.
“It's clear that violence against the police is not acceptable. But people are being criminalized here who above all were acting out of solidarity,” said Gökay Akbulut, Die Linke's spokesman on migration.
“I don’t think these people have a general problem with obeying the law,” he added.

					11:03 CET+01:00				",AFP/The Local,Food bank in Essen bars new migrant clients 'to ensure reasonable integration’,"A food bank in Essen, North Rhine-Westphalia has temporarily stopped accepting non-German new registrants.
Tafel Deutschland in Essen, one of the charitable association’s more than 930 nationwide food banks, is currently only accepting new customers with a German ID card.*
The food bank which serves free meals to the poor made the decision last December and implemented it in January until further notice.
On the organization’s website, they state the reason behind the decision was that they “felt compelled to ensure reasonable integration,” adding that they had seen an “increase in the number of migrants in recent years” and the proportion of foreign citizens among their customers had risen dramatically.
""We want German grandmothers to continue coming to us,” head of the association in Essen, Jörg Sartor, told the Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung (WAZ).
Over the past two years, the elderly people and single mothers visiting the food bank have slowly decreased and been replaced by foreigners, according to Sartor. At the time the decision was made, migrants and refugees made up 75 percent of the food bank’s 6,000 users, he says, whereas in 2015, 35 percent of customers were non-Germans.
Inquiries had moreover shown that older women in particular felt deterred by the large number of young, foreign men at the food bank. Some of the men showed ""a lack of respect for women"" and ""when we unlocked the door in the morning, there was pushing and shoving regardless of grandmas in line,"" Sartor said.
Essen’s Tafel Deutschland had long debated how to restore balance between locals and foreigners, reports WAZ.
In January 2017, for instance, the association decided that people over the age of 60 receiving social benefits such as Hartz IV, basic income or housing allowance may extend their food bank privileges for a further year. Prior to this time it was compulsory for them to take a one-year break after visiting the food bank for a year.
But many elderly people have not taken advantage of extending their visits and have instead opted out, according to the chairman.
Acknowledging the issue as a “hot topic,” Sartor predicted there would be uneasiness among the visitors once the decision was made. ""Strangely enough, there hasn’t been any fuss.”
Tafel Deutschland spokesperson Stefanie Bresgott told The Local on Thursday that the food bank in Essen was the only location amongst over 930 food banks across the country with such a policy in place.
For the time being new customers at the food bank in Essen may only be Germans ""until the scales are balanced again"" between locals and foreigners, said Sartor.
The first Tafel Deutschland opened in Germany 25 years ago. Heavily reliant on volunteers, the group collects surplus food that would otherwise be discarded by supermarkets and other businesses to prepare and serve it to the poor.
*In an earlier version of this article, The Local incorrectly stated that the food bank in Essen was only catering to German citizens for the time being."

After Salvini wrote on Facebook about the non-government organisation's cargo of ""human flesh"", the NGO responded: ""Dear Matteo Salvini, we have no meat on board, but humans.""
""We cordially invite you to convince yourself that it is people we have saved from drowning. Come here, you are welcome!"" said the charity's reply.
The Lifeline rescue vessel Sunday remained in limbo west of Malta, with 239 people aboard, including 14 women and four infants, who were rescued near the Libyan coast, said the group.
They had received food and water from Malta, and medical supplies and blankets provided by two other German rescue ships, the Sea-Eye and Sea-Watch, said Mission Lifeline spokesman Axel Steier.
Lifeline said it was also hoping to rendezvous in the waters off Malta with Danish container ship Alexander Maersk, which had rescued 113 migrants off southern Italy.
The larger cargo ship could provide some protection to the smaller Lifeline in case of bad weather, while the rescue ship could help with its on-board medical facilities, he said.
Salvini two weeks ago turned back another rescue vessel, the Aquarius of French group SOS Mediterranee, which eventually docked in Spain. The move sparked protests from France and other EU countries and deepened ruptures in the bloc on the flashpoint issue of immigration.
As 16 EU countries were to meet on the issue at a mini-summit in Brussels on Sunday, the German charity expressed hope other European countries may help out.
Steier hoped for ""positive signals"" from the meeting and said ""our hope is that (EU) states offer to take in the people, in solidarity with the concerns of Italy""."

""Sea-Eye has decided to resume its rescue missions in the Mediterranean which had been halted for a month,"" the NGO said in a statement.
However, its two ships, the Sea-Eye and the Seefuchs, would now operate in a perimeter of 70 to 90 nautical miles from the Libyan coast, it said, ""to take account of the constant threat from the Libyan coastguard and to not compromise the safety of the crews"".
Sea-Eye said its decision to return was partly prompted by events on September 2, when the Seefuchs was called on to help with a rescue mission 50 miles off Libya in which 16 people in a wooden boat were saved from drowning.
""This case shows that claims by Frontex and the EU that there are no more refugees, and therefore no more drowning people, off the Libyan coast are false.""
Frontex is the EU's border management agency.
Survivors last week reported that two more vessels, rubber boats filled with migrants, had set out at the same as they did, the NGO said. Those boats and their passengers disappeared without a trace.
'Irresponsible'
""The deal between European countries and the Libyan coast guard is irresponsible,"" Sea-Eye chairman Michael Buschheuer said in the statement, because it allowed ""a situation contrary to international law"" to continue.
""We owe it to the people in need to stay on site and undertake rescue operations when necessary,"" he said.
Tensions have risen since the Libyan navy last month ordered foreign vessels to stay out of a coastal search-and rescue zone, a measure it said was specifically aimed at non-governmental groups.
Libyan authorities have accused charities of aiding human smugglers with their rescues at sea, hampering efforts to crack down on the illegal migration route.
Six years since a revolution that toppled longtime dictator Moamer Kadhafi, Libya has become a key departure point for migrants risking their lives to cross the Mediterranean to Europe.
Tens of thousands of migrants have resorted to paying people traffickers for the journey, often on overcrowded and unseaworthy boats.
Migrant aid ships have played a key role in assisting the rescue operations. Sea-Eye says it has helped save some 12,000 lives since April 2016."

SEE ALSO: Food bank in Essen bars new migrant clients 'to ensure integration'
The charity that serves free meals to the poor had drawn widespread criticism after it declared last week it would from now on demand German identity papers for new clients because a huge migrant influx was displacing locals in need.
Sartor, 61, had claimed that many elderly Germans and single mothers were scared of an increasingly aggressive atmosphere as the number of foreigners using the charity had risen to three-quarters of the total.
Sartor stirred further controversy by saying that some migrant groups shared a ""give-me gene"" and did not understand Germany's ""queueing culture"".
More than 1.2 million asylum seekers have come to Europe's biggest economy since 2015 -- more than half from war-torn Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan -- in a mass wave that sparked a xenophobic backlash.
'Restore balance'
The charity in the city of Essen, like hundreds of similar groups nationwide, collects surplus food that would otherwise be discarded by supermarkets to serve it to the poor.
None of the other more than 900 food banks in Germany publicly said they would replicate the step, with many insisting they would help those in need irrespective of where they came from.

German police and the internal security service, responsible for investigating politically-inspired offences, said they had launched probes into the graffiti spraying which occurred at the weekend.
The far-right and anti-immigration Alternative for Germany (AfD) party launched a social media campaign in defence of the charity entitled ""If you fight back, you're a Nazi"".
The charity ""was not founded to deal with the chaos of (Chancellor Angela) Merkel's refugee policy but to meet the demand that was already there"", it stated on Facebook.
Essener Tafel said last week it had taken the step in order to avoid friction between needy locals and foreigners that could harm acceptance of the newcomers.
The charity had announced the change locally in December and implemented it in mid-January, but it was only widely reported last Thursday, initially by the newspaper Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung.
Sartor told the daily that his charity would maintain the additional demand that new clients show not just proof they receive social welfare but also German identity papers to register themselves ""until the balance is restored""."

The large group of migrants mainly from Africa had surrounded the patrol cars and pestered the police. Some of the men hit the police patrol cars and the vehicles were damaged as a result, reports the Stuttgarter Zeitung (SZ).
The migrants then sent a security officer from the refugee home to act as an intermediary and gave the police an ultimatum: take the Togolese man's handcuffs off within two minutes, otherwise they would storm the entrance gate of the accommodation.
The police decided to give the security officer a key so that he could release the 23-year-old from his handcuffs.

Several high-profile crimes committed by migrants since then have further hardened the public mood, fuelling the rise of the far-right, anti-Islam Alternative for Germany (AfD) party.
Most recently, far-right extremists have rallied in the eastern city of Chemnitz after a German man was stabbed to death on August 26th, with an Iraqi asylum seeker the prime suspect. Images of far-right protesters chasing down foreign-looking people in violent demonstrations and of neo-Nazis giving the Hitler salute in front of lines of police officers have stunned the nation.
""Violence is never a solution,"" Salvini told Deutsche Welle. ""Violence calls for violence, but the German government has been underestimating the problem for years, and the rise of the AfD is clearly a reaction.""
Salvini has taken a tough anti-immigration stance since his hard-right League party formed a government with the populist Five Star Movement last June.
He has refused NGO migrant rescue ships access to Italian ports, and accuses Brussels of having abandoned Italy as it struggles to deal with the arrival of hundreds of thousands of migrants since 2013.

Merkel's government is hanging in the balance, as she faces a threat by her Interior Minister Horst Seehofer that unless she reaches EU deals allowing the return of many asylum-seekers, he will shutter German borders to them by early July.
Asked whether she thought the accords with Athens and Madrid met Seehofer's ultimatum requirements, Merkel told reporters in Brussels that she believed they even surpassed them.
""They are more than equivalent in their effect,"" she said.

'Gesture of solidarity'
New Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez acknowledged that Merkel's difficulties at home had helped focus minds in Brussels.
""We sympathise with the situation Germany is going through at the moment,"" he told reporters. ""Chancellor Merkel was grateful for this gesture of solidarity.""
Seehofer is head of Christian Social Union (CSU), the Bavarian sister party of Merkel's Christian Democrats. Any move toward closing the border between Bavaria and Austria would force Merkel to sack Seehofer and likely end the parties' seven-decade alliance.
This has raised the spectre of an implosion of Merkel's uneasy coalition government just over 100 days after it took office, and possibly the political demise of the EU's longest-serving leader.
Merkel is to meet with her conservative alliance over the weekend to inform them of the EU summit's results, with announcements expected Sunday on how the two sides will proceed.
The CSU's Alexander Dobrindt sounded a conciliatory note on Friday, saying that the summit's conclusions had gone a long way toward meeting his party's demands.
""The fact is that it is a result of the debate in Germany that the EU is finally confronting the migration issue in a stronger way,"" he said in Berlin.
'Can't wait forever'
However the party's deputy leader, Angelika Niebler, said the CSU would cast a sceptical eye over the fine print, particularly with regard to the implementation of the agreements.
""Are we talking about a few months or a few years?"" she told public broadcaster Bayerischer Rundfunk. ""We can't wait forever.""
The divide between the sister parties dates back to the height of the refugee influx in 2015, when Merkel, citing the threat of a humanitarian disaster, agreed to leave the border open to asylum-seekers. Since then, new arrivals have fallen dramatically but the political impact has festered in some quarters and placed particular pressure on conservatives facing deep-seated fears among their voters.
As the CSU gears up for a Bavarian state election in October, it is facing a stiff challenge from the far-right, anti-migration Alternative for Germany (AfD) party.
During the campaign, the CSU has lurched to the right and cranked up its tough talk against migrants, intensifying the pressure on Merkel to harden her stance on an issue that has come to define her politically both at home and abroad.

""Maybe the migrant jumped off the train to evade checks in Austria and had no time to put his shoe on,"" said Rainer Scharf, a police spokesman at the small southern German station of Raubling, where a team of officers had arrived to inspect freight train carriages.
A little further down under another container, flattened water bottles and biscuit packaging suggested that at least one other migrant was on the train.
Such finds are becoming alarmingly common as freight trains gain popularity with migrants seeking to reach northern Europe.
Many of these mostly sub-Saharan African or north African migrants have arrived in Europe by sea, boarding rickety vessels to cross the Mediterranean from Libya to reach Italy.
Since 2014, more than 600,000 people have landed in Italy after the dangerous sea journey, and some 14,000 people have lost their lives trying to cross.
And some are taking a second gamble with their lives by jumping on freight trains to get to destinations such as Germany.
Between July and mid-September, more than 200 people were found on such trains.
In comparison, there were hardly any such stowaways in 2016, and only around 20 cases in the first half of this year.
Police say the new route arose after Schengen countries reimposed border controls in the wake of the 2015 migrant crisis.
Asked why they were risking their lives again, the stowaways said that they were desperate to leave Italy as they didn't feel welcome, or because they
wanted to make money or learn a trade.
Others said they want to rejoin their families who are already in Germany, Scharf said.
""But it's still extremely dangerous,"" he stressed.
Falling on tracks
To travel undetected, the migrants lie in the small gap between the goods container and the flat-bed of the train carriage, remaining immobile for hours.
""A wrongly calculated move could result in them falling on the rails while the train is running at full speed. And that's not even taking into account the fact that the trains travel through the mountains where it can be very cold, even in the summer,"" said a policewoman.
The corpse of a young migrant was found on the rails close to the Austrian
border in early June, believed to have fallen off a freight train.
The tragedy led police to boost checks at Raubling, just a few kilometres away from the Austrian border.
Around 30 officers turn up several times a month to inspect the trains, using ladders, mirrors and torchlights to look at potential hiding holes.
When the weather allows for it, a helicopter equipped with a thermal camera flies over each train to detect migrants through the heat emitted by their bodies.
""A few days ago, I was on the platform when the police took two migrants from their hiding places in the train,"" said Kauer Zimmerman, 72, a Raubling resident.
""I was shocked by the condition they were in - they were covered in big jackets but still shivering.""
Like her, the 11,000 inhabitants of the Bavarian town are getting used to regular delays on passenger trains as the schedule is affected by freight
train checks.
""The Italians let the migrants go, the Austrians too, and so they arrive here,"" said Birgitt Nopper, a pensioner in Raubling waiting to catch a train.
Scharf defended Austrian police, saying they work in close collaboration.
""We work closely with Austrian police. If they have already checked a train, we're not going to check it again."""

She gave no further details about the Athens agreement, but the deal reached with Madrid allows Berlin to send back Spanish-registered migrants within 48 hours of their arrival on German soil.
Merkel has been under pressure to reduce the number of new arrivals after a record influx of more than a million asylum seekers between 2015 and 2016 unsettled Germany.
The issue of tighter border controls sparked a major clash in July between the chancellor and hardline Interior Minister Horst Seehofer which brought their coalition to the brink of collapse.
Germany has since sought a series of bilateral agreements with EU partners, after a broader accord for the bloc proved elusive.
Italy has, however, been reluctant. Its Interior Minister Matteo Salvini of the far-right League party has said Rome first expects to see more action to toughen the EU's external borders, before it will consider striking a deal.
The German political row was triggered when Seehofer, who heads Merkel's more traditional CSU sister party, threatened to turn back migrants at German borders if they had already made asylum requests in other EU countries.
Fearing the domino-effect of borders slamming shut that such unilateral action would unleash, Merkel instead pushed for a wider EU response that would include migrant return deals with the frontline states Greece, Italy and Spain."

Seehofer was long the harshest critic within Merkel's conservative bloc of her decision to open Germany's borders to a mass influx of refugees and migrants since 2015.

With 800 officers, the federal police searched apartments and offices in more than a dozen locations in northern and central Germany on Monday evening and early Tuesday morning, including Hamburg, Bremen and towns in Saxony-Anhalt.
First reported by news agencies NDR, WDR and Süddeutsche Zeitung, the raid was against eight suspects alleged to have smuggled several hundred Moldovan citizens intoto Germany with forged Romanian passports and employed them illegally in the security industry.
Süddeutsche Zeitung reported that the shelters of the smuggled Moldovans were searched on Tuesday morning before they left for their jobs. The illegal immigrants were questioned by the police in order to ascertain and register their real identities.
The police, including various special units, searched multiple premises in the Hamburg area, two buildings in Bremen and more in Saxony-Anhalt.
A spokesman for the federal police in Pirna said that approximately 800 officers have executed 21 search warrants since Monday evening, and further noted that some suspects have ties to the far-right Reichsbürger movement in Saxony-Anhalt.
The Reichsbürger movement is considered extremist due to the fact that it rejects the legitmacy of the modern German state, and its adherents consider themselves ""Reich citizens"". Police did not immediately say how the Reichsbürger scene may be connected with the smugglings.
Two Germans and one Russian between the ages of 30 and 43 had already been provisionally arrested in Hamburg on Monday. On Tuesday, a decision is expected to be made as to whether to issue an official arrest warrant for the men.
Many of the illegal Moldavians worked in the port of Hamburg as security guards on various construction sites and even in asylum seekers' homes.
Since last October, the public prosecutor's office in Lüneburg, a town near Hamburg, has been investigating the network of smugglers.

					17:43 CEST+02:00				",Emma Anderson ,Migrant workers send $14 billion back home,"Migrant workers in Germany sent $14 billion (€12.5 billion) back to their families last year, according to a report published on Monday.
Germany was one of the top countries in Europe for the amount of money that migrant workers sent back home in remittances, according to a report by the International Fund for Agricultural Development.
Remittance payments refer to regular payments that migrant workers send back to their families in their home countries. The report said that this money usually covers ""basic goods, such as food, clothing, shelter, medicine and education"".
""Remittance payments can make up 50 percent of a family's income - at the least,"" explained Pedro de Vasconcelos, head of the IFAD remittances programme, to The Local. ""They need this money in order to sustain the family, send kids to school, have shelter and food. And hopefully have some to save and invest.""
Germany ranked behind Russia ($20.6 billion) and the United Kingdom ($17.1 billion) for the most money sent outside the country by migrant workers, followed by France ($10.5 billion) and Italy ($10.4 billion).
Unlike the other countries in the report, Germany saw migrant workers sending the largest portion of money to other European states.
Poland was the main recipient of funds from German migrant workers at $2.3 billion, followed by Lebanon and Hungary, which each received nearly $1 billion.
Meanwhile, the strong migration links between Turkey and Germany were reflected by the fact that 48 percent of remittance money arriving in Turkey came from Germany. In Kosovo this proportion was second highest.
Still, De Vasconcelos told The Local that the relationship between Turkey and Germany has changed over time since a 1960s ""guest worker"" programme between the two countries ushered in a wave of Turkish migrant workers.
De Vasconcelos said that while a decade ago Turkey received about $7 billion in remittance money from Germany, it now takes in roughly half a billion euros.
""Some Turks have returned, and for others the ties with families have changed,"" he said. ""This is one example that shows the impact of Germany on Turkey and its development over decades.""
Top Countries Where German Migrants Sent Money
Source: International Fund for Agricultural Development.
The report said that though the amount of money sent by migrant workers to families outside of the country might seem high, these payments did not result in a ""significant outflow of wealth"".
The $14 billion sent to families from German workers accounted for just 0.38 percent of Germany's GDP (gross domestic product).
In total European migrant workers sent home $109.4 billion, which helped to support more than 150 million people across the globe, the report said.
One-third of this money went to countries within Europe, especially to Ukraine, Poland and Romania.
Most immigrants sent between $1,500 and $3,200 in the entire year.
The report calls for efforts to lower the costs migrants face in transferring funds to loved ones, which eat up about $2.5 billion in transfer fees each year for European migrants."

For all of 2017, ""I presume a total of fewer than 200,000 migrants,"" Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere was quoted as saying by the Bild am Sonntag newspaper.
The EU's top economy has taken in more than one million asylum seekers since 2015, around half from conflict-torn Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan, in a mass intake that sparked a xenophobic backlash.
The total for 2015 reached 890,000, but arrivals slowed sharply after several Balkans transit countries shuttered their borders and the EU in March 2016 reached a deal with Turkey to stop crossings to the Greek islands.
Arrivals of new asylum seekers to Germany fell back to around 280,000 in 2016.
Chancellor Angela Merkel has come under strong pressure for her liberal immigration policy, and her Bavarian allies the CSU have long pushed for a maximum intake of 200,000 refugees a year.
Merkel has agreed to the figure but labelled it a ""benchmark"" rather than an iron-cast maximum.
De Maiziere said that by late November this year, the number of new asylum seekers in Germany stood at around 173,000."

The Federal Anti-Discrimination Agency wrote in an evaluation seen by Die Welt that there must be a reform of the country's Equal Treatment Act, in particular for people from an immigration background.
One of the solutions could be a similar quota system to the controversial one passed by the German parliament last year for women. The so-called ‘women quota' asks publicly traded companies with employee representation on the board to include 30 percent female directors.
The women's quota only applies to companies with more than 500 workers.
Another option would be for companies to have better “diversity goals”.
The anti-discrimination agency wrote that legislators should put in place effective and “positive measures” and include more protected categories of people in anti-discrimination laws.
The agency also explained that there are many ""holes"" in protection policies, citing an agency survey that found every third person reported being discriminated against within the past two years because of their age, sex or another criteria set out in German law.
But only six percent of those who said they had felt discrimination had initiated legal action.
“People affected by racism complain very little,” the agency wrote, explaining that this is not because there is little racism, but rather because “it can be interpreted as a sign of inadequate incentives and resources available.”
The agency therefore called for the strengthening of legal protections against discrimination and said that groups like unions or employee organizations should have more power to file complaints. They also suggest extending the current two-month window where an employee must report a violation to six months.
The agency's report is set to be officially presented on Tuesday."

traffickers said on Tuesday it had been the victim of a ""despicable smear campaign"".
Humanitarian group Jugend Rettet went to court to demand the immediate release of its 33-metre boat the Iuventa, which was seized on August 2 on the island of Lampedusa.
A judge in Trapani, Sicily will rule on the request for the vessel's release by Friday.
The high-profile seizure came as Italy moves to regulate the activities of NGOs operating off Libya against a backdrop of claims their presence was encouraging migrants to try to reach Europe and making life easier for traffickers.
The seizure was ordered by an investigating magistrate based on testimony from two former police officers working as security on another boat patrolling waters off Libya to help save refugees and other migrants trying to cross the Mediterranean on rickety dinghies and converted fishing boats chartered by traffickers.
The pair have testified, with the support of photographs, that they witnessed Iuventa crew members talking to presumed traffickers and that, on at least one occasion, the NGO's staff had towed a wooden boat from which migrants had been rescued back into Libyan waters, making it available for reuse by traffickers.
The NGO provided its side of the story on Tuesday, notably detailing contacts between the crew and the Italian coastguard, which coordinates rescue activity in the area.
""All the evidence collected has been presented and interpreted in an erroneous manner,"" said spokesman Philipp Kuelker, highlighting reported links between the key witnesses and far-right groups.
He said the Iuventa's position had been in line with instructions from the coastguard and that the boat supposedly delivered back to traffickers was only towed a short distance to get it away from the NGO's boat.
The alleged traffickers seen talking to the Iuventa crew members were in fact armed criminals who frequently attempt to pick up outboard motors after or even during rescues.
""We demand the immediate release of our ship, the dropping of any charges against the organisation or crew members and that those responsible for this despicable smear campaign publicly apologise..."" Jugend Rettet said in a statement.
Founded by students in 2015, the organization, whose name translates as ""Youth Saves"" took part in rescues of more than 14,000 people between July 2016 and the seizure of the Iuventa last month."

					14:03 CEST+02:00				",DPA/The Local,EU reports widespread abuse of migrant workers,"A report published on Tuesday documents appalling conditions for migrant workers in the EU. In Germany the construction sector was singled out for blame.
The European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights (FRA) came to its conclusions after conducting around 600 interviews with trade unions, police, and representatives of the supervisory authorities.
The agency believes that starvation wages, the removal of passports and being cut off from the outside world are all commonplace forms of exploitation of a migrant workforce which has come from outside the EU.
“Foreign work forces are at serious risk of being exploited in the EU,” said Blanca Tapia of the FRA.
Every fifth interviewee came across instances of exploitation at least twice a week, it is claimed in the report. Some of the affected people were earning one Euro per hour or less and worked for six or seven days a week without a contract.
Germany which is one of only four European countries which offers the same protection to non-EU workers as EU-citizens, was criticized for standards in its construction sector.
The prevalence of subcontractors in the sector meant that workers were particularly at risk, the report argued.
The Federal Republic was also criticized for the lack of clarity on which agency is responsible for tackling exploitation of immigrant labour.
“Nobody takes responsibility,” said Albin Dearing of the FRA.
But the report did not go into numbers of people being exploited in Germany or in the EU as a whole.
“These crimes happen behind closed doors,” explained Tapia. “No one can know exact numbers.”
It was instead the aimed at identifying the causes of exploitation and the types of people most vulnerable.
The FRA called for stronger laws and better oversight. They also recommended a seal which would indicate whether a product had been created in conditions free from exploitation."

Lifeline also said its ship remained in waters off Malta amid ""deteriorating weather conditions and an increasingly fragile health situation of the rescued people"", despite news Tuesday that it could dock there and that the migrants would be taken in by six EU countries.
Italy and France have accused the charity of acting illegally by refusing to hand the shipwrecked migrants over to the coastguard during the June 21 rescue, arguing that such operations play into the hands of human traffickers.
But Lifeline argued that the migrants would not be safe in Libya, where they have faced abuse and rape in holding centres, and that returning them there would breach international refugee law.
""There have been a number of false accusations that Lifeline ignores orders by different MRCCs (maritime rescue coordination centres),"" said the group's co-founder Axel Steier in a statement.
""The only order the ship denied was to hand over people to the so-called Libyan coastguard, as this would have been not in line with the Geneva Refugee Convention and therefore criminal.""
Lifeline said it followed the principle of non-refoulement under international law that forbids returning asylum seekers to a country where they likely face persecution.
The vessel's fate has hung in the balance since last week as EU members remain at loggerheads over how to handle the influx of people fleeing war and misery to reach the continent.
The decision by Italy's new hardline government and Malta to turn away rescue vessels has plunged Europe into a political crisis over how to collectively respond.
French President Emmanuel Macron said Tuesday, after days of bickering between EU member states over the ship's fate, that Malta would allow it to dock and the migrants be distributed to six EU countries.
However, Macron also criticised the German NGO running the ship for contravening ""all the rules"" by coming to the migrants' rescue when the Libyan coastguard was already intervening."

Merkel will first travel to Mali and Niger before heading to Ethiopia where she is to visit the headquarters of the African Union in the capital, Addis Ababa.
Her talks with leaders of all three countries are to focus on migration issues and the battle against jihadist groups.
On Wednesday, a day after her return to Berlin, she will host Chadian President Idriss Deby. She will cap off the week by meeting with Nigeria's President Muhammadu Buhari to discuss the African giant's battle against Boko Haram Islamists.
""The well-being of Africa is in Germany's interest,"" Merkel told Die Zeit weekly in an interview ahead of the visit, arguing that bringing more stability to Africa and improving living conditions on the continent would help reduce the numbers of people seeking to leave.
Simply ignoring the reasons that are pushing people to migrate ""will not make the problem go away,"" she warned.
Pointing to drought plaguing Chad as an example, Merkel said that ""it does not mean that everyone who is in difficulties there can come to Europe as a refugee"".
""But we should be interested in whether 11 million people will have a livelihood or not,"" she stressed.
'Holistic approach'
In a sign of Germany's growing engagement in Africa, Berlin's ambassador to Niamey said Wednesday it would build a military base in Niger to support the UN mission fighting jihadists in neighbouring Mali.
Germany has troops stationed in Mali and Niger as part of the UN mission MINUSMA, and Merkel is due to visit the soldiers during her upcoming tour.
Drawing attention to Merkel's trip to Africa, Jordan's King Abdullah II commended the German leader for taking a ""holistic approach"" to dealing with the migrant challenge.
""It's not just Syria and Iraq, it's north Africa, it's east and west Africa and here I want to commend the chancellor's role because there are very leaders in the world who look at the challenges we are facing... as a global problem,"" he told journalists.
Merkel has also said that she wants the European Union and North African countries to do deals modelled on a controversial agreement with Turkey to curb migrant flows to Europe.
Under the EU-Turkey agreement, Ankara agreed to take back one Syrian who made it to Greece in return for being allowed to send one from its massive refugee camps to the bloc in a more orderly redistribution programme.
The deal also pledges billions of euros in EU aid for Turkey, visa-free European travel for Turkish citizens and accelerated EU membership talks."

The mural was painted by a Syrian refugee in a former supermarket converted into a hostel for asylum-seekers.
The photograph, which went viral in September 2015, brought home the horrors of the migrant crisis to the world.
The museum, which is now collecting items for the exhibition, said one refugee family has already provided clothing.

Ahmad was among hundreds of thousands of asylum seekers who have sought refuge in Germany since Chancellor Angela Merkel's decision on September 4th, 2015 to keep the country's borders open to people fleeing war and misery.
Overwhelmed by the sheer numbers of new arrivals that reached over a million in three years, Germany's refugee agency and legal system is running a massive backlog on asylum applications and appeals.
As a result, many migrants have found themselves still in a limbo years after they arrived, uncertain if they will be allowed to stay.
""I've been waiting, but nothing's coming,"" he told AFP. Ahmad's initial asylum application was rejected in December 2016 by the Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF).
But he promptly filed an appeal in January 2017. Since then, he has been waiting for Berlin's courts to decide.
Legal backlog
Like the BAMF, the courts are overloaded. Some appeals are similar to Ahmad's, while others are seeking to extend their residency permits. In the most urgent cases, plaintiffs are seeking to obtain stay for deportation orders.
Critics blame mistakes or sloppy decisions made at the BAMF for the legal jam.
""They hired these people who are not qualified"" to deal with the delicate mission of determining people's future, said Greens MP Filiz Polat.
As a result, more than one in two BAMF decisions ended up in a legal appeal in the first half of 2018.
At the end of 2017, 372,000 appeals were awaiting examination by the courts, four times more than in 2016, the government said.
In Berlin, ""more than two-thirds of the cases have not yet been dealt with by the administrative court for asylum law,"" the court said.
Amid the legal entanglements, migrants like Ahmad are left living in uncertainty.
""It's stressful. I can't live peacefully,"" he said.
Dire consequences
Migrants are granted temporary residency in Germany pending the final verdicts.
But Ahmad said these permits are for brief stays of three or six months.
Such short permits mean he is effectively locked out of the rental market as landlords want to see permits of at least a year.
For the last two years, Ahmad has shared a room of less than 20 square metres (200 square feet) with two other refugees in a shelter.
Their shared kitchen is upstairs and with communal living comes annoyances of ""cigarette issues, promiscuity and noise"", he said.
Meanwhile, a bureaucratic delay elsewhere resulted in a failed Iraqi asylum seeker remaining in eastern Germany, where he allegedly stabbed a man to death in Chemnitz. The killing sparked xenophobic demonstrations.
The suspect should have been deported to Bulgaria - his first port of call in the European Union - but the administration failed to carry out the expulsion in time, according to Interior Minister Horst Seehofer.
Having missed the legal deadline, authorities had to reexamine his dossier from scratch.
Ahmad, a keen football fan whose mop of curls is reminiscent of Egyptian player Mohamed Salah's, dreams of signing up for training in nursing - a sector in which an ageing Germany has a chronic staff shortage.
While waiting for the court decision, he is trying to obtain qualifications that would allow him to get an apprenticeship in the sector.
To make ends meet, he works in the evenings, making cappuccinos in a snack bar.
Data suggests that some headway has been made in getting newcomers into the work force.
Some 290,000 refugees who arrived since 2015 have already found work, according to the employment agency.
The proportion of migrants still dependent on state aid has decreased by 36 percent between 2016 and 2017, it said.
And despite the long wait, Ahmad is determined to make it work in Germany.
""When I arrived in Germany, I didn't have an idea what I should expect. What counted for me was to flee Iraq,"" Ahmad said.
""Now I know that my future is here."""

In a statement, Sea Eye said it was with ""a heavy heart"" that it had decided to follow suit following the Libyan government's ""explicit threat against the private NGOs"".
Tensions have been on the rise since the Libyan navy on Thursday ordered foreign vessels to stay out of a coastal search and rescue zone, a measure it said was specifically aimed at non-governmental groups.
Libyan authorities have accused charities of aiding human smugglers with their rescues at sea, hampering efforts to crack down on the illegal migration route.
""Under these circumstances, a continuation of our rescue work is not currently possible. It would be irresponsible towards our crews,"" Sea Eye founder Michael Buschheuer said.
Italy, which has borne the brunt of Europe's migrant crisis this year, has also moved to rein in NGOs helping the multinational search and rescue operation by making them sign up to a new code of conduct.
Sea Eye said it would continue to monitor the ""changed security situation"" off the Libyan coast.
""We leave behind a deadly gap in the Mediterranean,"" Buschheuer warned.
Six years since a revolution that toppled longtime dictator Moamer Kadhafi, Libya has become a key departure point for migrants risking their lives to cross the Mediterranean to Europe.
Tens of thousands of migrants have resorted to paying people traffickers for the journey, often on overcrowded and unseaworthy boats.

The Essener Tafel charity in the western city of Essen said non-Germans could start registering for the service again from Wednesday.
""Right now, the ratio of Germans and foreigners in need is appropriate,"" the group's chairman, Joerg Sartor, told the Bild daily. ""If new bottlenecks occur, we will have to adapt again.""
From now on, preference would be given to the elderly, single parents, young families and those with disabilities -- regardless of their nationality,
Sartor added, citing a decision made by the group's board. The charity triggered a storm of controversy earlier this year when it announced it would only accept new clients if they had German identity papers, claiming a huge influx of migrants was displacing needy locals.
Sartor said at the time that especially elderly Germans and single mothers had been intimidated by an increasingly aggressive atmosphere as the number of foreigners queuing for free food had risen to three-quarters of the total.
The migrant ban, which the charity always insisted was temporary, sparked howls of protest across the country and none of Germany's more than 900 other food banks followed suit.
Even Chancellor Angela Merkel weighed in on the controversy, calling the Essener Tafel's decision ""not good"".
Vandals also sprayed the word ""Nazis"" on the charity's building and vans, an act police said they believe was in response to the ban.
Some 1.2 million asylum seekers have come to Europe's biggest economy since 2015 -- more than half from war-torn Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan.
The influx sparked a xenophobic backlash that has fuelled the rise of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party.
The AfD had defended Essener Tafel on social media, complaining that an ""onslaught of migrants"" was displacing Germans and ""if you fight back, you're a Nazi"".
Like other similar organisations, the Essener Tafel collects surplus food that would otherwise be discarded by supermarkets and other businesses to prepare and serve it to the poor.
Typically, people have to register to qualify for regular free meals by proving that they are recipients of unemployment or other social benefits."

Seehofer's Christian Social Union party in Bavaria state actively courted Orban during those years in an affront to Merkel. Spiegel said she now appeared to recognise that EU hardliners could no longer be ignored or stonewalled.
Merkel's fateful decision in 2015 to leave the German border open to those fleeing Middle East conflict zones was prompted primarily by Orban's refusal to offer them refuge, effectively blocking the so-called Balkan route into the EU.
At the time, Orban railed against Merkel's ""moral imperialism"" while the chancellor, who grew up in communist East Germany, said she had seen enough walls in Europe for a lifetime.
Since then, far-right parties are sharing power in key countries such as Italy and Austria while the anti-immigration Alternative for Germany party won nearly 100 seats in the Bundestag lower house.
Merkel's tone towards Orban has changed recently as well. Last week she even thanked the Hungarian leader for his efforts to bolster the EU's external borders, while Orban declared the ""enormous success"" of his tough stance in the conclusions of an EU summit last week.
In an interview with ARD public television Wednesday, Merkel denied that she had sacrificed the European principles of open borders and compassion toward qualified asylum seekers on the altar of power politics.
Merkel, who has said that Europe's fate could be determined by the migration issue, said the accords she had hammered out at the EU summit and within her own government were aimed at keeping the asylum system from collapsing.
""I understand that if you only ever talk about border security, border security, border security that people will say: you only want to seal yourselves off,"" she said.
""Of course I always asked myself whether what we are doing is right and important. And I always told myself, yes, it is important to stick to these principles. That is why I am pleased we've found a solution.""
The German solution, however, is dependent on bilateral agreements with EU states to take back asylum seekers who previously registered in their countries.
Budapest has until now rebuffed such overtures. Seehofer is due in Vienna later on Thursday to discuss similar cooperation."

					11:45 CEST+02:00				",AFP,Anti-migrant AfD eyes big gains even in hip Berlin,"German Chancellor Angela Merkel faces the threat of fresh gains by the right-wing populist AfD party in Berlin state elections Sunday, as discontent rises over her welcome to refugees.
Although Germany's multicultural hipster capital looks bound to re-elect the centre-left Social Democrats (SPD) as the top party, the AfD is polling at around 14 percent with support strongest in the poorer tower-block districts of the city's former communist east.
This would place the anti-migrant Alternative for Germany into its 10th of the country's 16 state assemblies, a year ahead of national elections, and continue a voter drift away from the mainstream parties.
Breaking a taboo in post-war German politics, the AfD openly panders to xenophobic and anti-Islam sentiments, similar to France's National Front or far-right populists in Austria and the Netherlands.
It has also tapped into popular frustration with the two major parties who - from Berlin's glass-domed Reichstag building - rule Germany in a right-left 'grand coalition' with a crushing majority.
One member of Merkel's centre-right Christian Democrats (CDU) who said he plans to defect to the AfD is Bastian Behrens, a 42-year-old public relations executive from Berlin's leafy southwest.
At an AfD meeting he charged that, of the one million asylum seekers who came to Germany last year, many are ""economic refugees"".
""It costs a lot of money and it's hard to integrate them - just look at the Turks who came here 30 years ago,"" he said, pointing to western Berlin's large ethnic Turkish community.
""Many of them haven't integrated,"" he claimed. ""They form a parallel society.""
'Big party losses'
Political scientist Nils Diederich of Berlin's Free University said that, since the SPD in Berlin has traditionally beaten the CDU, its current junior coalition partner in the capital, the outcome will have little meaning nationwide.
The real issue, he said, will be ""the size of the losses of the big parties to the AfD"".
""I think, in Berlin too, the AfD will mobilise people who normally don't vote, and people who have conservative right-wing views but have so far been unwilling to vote for right-wing extremists.""
More than 70,000 asylum seekers came to Berlin last year, with thousands still housed in refugee shelters, including the cavernous hangars of the Nazi-built former Tempelhof airport, once the hub for the Cold War-era Berlin airlift.
The migrant issue looms large, but it isn't the only election topic in the city of 3.5 million people.
Affordable housing has become a hot-button issue as property prices and rents have shot up with an influx of 50,000 newcomers every year, though they are still far below the costs in Paris and London.
Berlin - though a European metropolis loved for its arts scene, green spaces and vibrant nightlife - is also chronically broke and suffers an above-average jobless rate of around 10 percent.
Lacking major industry, it is a net beneficiary of public funds transferred from rich states such as Bavaria, although it prides itself on a growing IT start-up scene and tourism.
The city's understaffed administration is notorious for its long waiting times, exemplified by chaotic scenes at its Lageso migrant registration centre last year.
Another symbol of Berlin's often disastrous planning is a huge, empty airport complex, the opening of which has run years behind schedule and is now pencilled in for late 2017.
'Poor but sexy'
The airport was planned in the era of colourful former SPD mayor Klaus Wowereit, a popular and openly gay bon vivant who coined the Berlin motto ""poor but sexy"".
His successor, the far blander Michael Müller, 51, is now battling for a popular mandate, having taken over mid-term from Wowereit almost two years ago.
His main opponent is the CDU's Frank Henkel, 52, who is running on a law-and-order platform, having ordered mass police raids targeting anti-capitalist squatters and demanded equipping police with tasers.
Müller's SPD, which has ruled west and then reunited Berlin alone or in coalition for most of the past few decades, looks set to again emerge as the strongest party, polling at 24 percent in a survey for public broadcaster ZDF.
This puts it easily ahead of the CDU, which scored 19 percent, and other parties such as the Greens and the far-left Linke.
Still, it would be the SPD's worst result in years and likely force it to rule in a three-way leftist coalition, given the increasingly frayed political party spectrum."

					11:33 CEST+02:00				",AFP,Merkel wants migrant return deals with N. African states,"German Chancellor Angela Merkel called Tuesday on the EU and North African countries to do deals modelled on a controversial agreement with Turkey to stem migrant flows to Europe.
Under the EU-Turkey agreement, Ankara agreed to take back one Syrian who made it to Greece in return for being allowed to send one from its massive refugee camps to the bloc in a more orderly redistribution programme.
The deal also pledges billions of euros in EU aid for Turkey, visa-free European travel for Turkish citizens and accelerated EU membership talks.
""We must agree on similar deals with other countries, such as in North Africa, in order to get better control over the Mediterranean sea refugee routes,"" Merkel told regional daily Neue Passauer Zeitung.
""Such agreements are also in the interest of the refugees themselves,"" she said, pointing to the huge risks migrants take in crossing the Mediterranean in rickety vessels, as well as the large sums they have to pay smugglers for the perilous sea passage.
""It is safer for them and there are good reasons for them to remain in Turkey, close to their homeland, where the cultural and language barriers are lower,"" she said, defending the deal with Turkey as ""correct, as before"".
""We should work to ensure that it lasts,"" she said.
But fears are mounting in the EU that the pact with Turkey to curb migrant flows could collapse as a rift deepens over Ankara's crackdown following a failed coup.
Turkey angrily rejects EU criticism that its post-putsch purges might violate rights norms Ankara must meet under the agreement in return for visa-free travel for Turks and accelerated negotiations for bloc membership.
Meanwhile, Merkel also urged EU partners to step up to their responsibilities in taking in refugees who had arrived in Greece.
Before the EU-Turkey deal took effect, some 45,000 refugees had already arrived in Greece as Macedonia closed its borders to the migrants.
""That is, if one compares it to the number of residents, as if 360,000 refugees were to arrive in Germany over the course of a few weeks,"" she said.
""That shows what Greece has had to deal with,"" she said, noting that the 3,000 refugees distributed so far to other EU states falls below the expectations of what the member states should take on."

					12:18 CET+01:00				",AFP/The Local,Huge gulf in crime rates among migrant groups,"Migrants arriving in Germany from North Africa are disproportionately likely to commit crime, police figures show - but deporting them isn't always straightforward.
After the mass sexual attacks in Cologne and other cities which eyewitnesses and police have said were carried out by men of “north African appearance” migrants from the Maghreb region have come under the spotlight.
Currently, 13 of the 19 people police are currently investigating in relation to the Cologne attacks come from the Maghreb - an area encompassing Libya, Tunisia, Algeria and Morocco.
And police figures seem to show that Maghrebi migrants are considerably more likely to commit crime than people from other regions, Spiegel Online reports.
A study begun by Cologne police in 2014 which looked at which refugees committed a crime within a year of their arrival showed stark variations from between different countries of origin.
Whereas only 0.5 percent of Syrians were suspected of a crime within 12 months of their arrival, 40 percent of those coming from the Maghreb got into trouble with police.
Only asylum seekers from the Balkan region were as likely to have broken the law in equivalent numbers.
The head of one refugee reception centre in the region told Spiegel that “North Africans often come to our attention for the wrong reasons here. They drink a alcohol excessively and are often under the influence of strong medication.”
A crime every 3.5 hours
An unpublished study by police in Düsseldorf seen by Spiegel Online, meanwhile, shows that there are over 2,200 criminals from the north African region active in the Rhineland city.
The Düsseldorf statistics also show that north Africans commit a crime on average every 3.5 hours in the city.
This criminality commonly comes in the form of theft, robbery, bodily harm and threats.
The report says that the situation is so bad that many residents of the city have lost confidence in their ability to feel safe in public spaces.
Residents in the city have now taken to forming ""citizens' patrol"" groups to ""protect our women"", which police are concerned that far-right groups could use to try and enact racist, vigilante justice.
Deportations tricky
But capturing criminals who arrive in the country as asylum seekers is far from straightforward.
Because authorities only take asylum seekers' fingerprints around six months after they arrive in the country, criminals can change their identity at will, Spiegel says.
The man shot by police in Paris last week after he attacked a police station, also allegedly from North Africa, lived under seven different pseudonyms in Germany before travelling to France.
Even when someone can be convicted of a crime serious enough for warrant ejection, deportations are also “almost impossible due to a lack of cooperation from their home countries,” the Cologne police report states.

To this end Chancellor Angela Merkel on Tuesday asked for Algeria's help in speeding up the repatriation of rejected Algerian asylum seekers to their country of origin.
Germany and Algeria have in place a mutual agreement governing expulsions of their citizens, ""but we have to ensure that it works properly,"" said Merkel at a press conference with visiting Algerian Prime Minister Abdelmalek Sellal.
German authorities have been calling for greater efficiency in deportation procedures, and the issue has gained urgency given the rising numbers of Algerians arriving in recent months with thousands of migrants seeking asylum.
Sellal however sounded a note of caution, saying before any deportations, ""we have to ensure that they really are Algerians"".
If Algerians were indeed among those guilty of participating in the mob violence in Cologne, then ""I can assure you that for us, Algeria, as a country and as a people, that is unacceptable,"" he said.
Berlin is mulling whether to classify Algeria and Morocco as safe countries of origin - a category which would mean its citizens were unlikely to qualify for asylum.
Merkel said Friday that no such decision had yet been taken on the issue, but that citizens of both nations stood less chance of winning asylum in Germany than those from war-torn countries like Syria and Iraq."

Research by the Hamburger Morgenpost (MOPO) suggests that Steve O., a 55-year-old from Ghana, was denied emergency treatment because he did not have health insurance.
The Ghanaian had needed heart surgery, but was refused treatment at Asklepios Clinics in St. Georg and Harburg, as well as the UKE hospital, the Albertinen hospital and a clinic in nearby Lübeck.
Steve O. died before a hospital could be found to treat him.
The 55-year-old had entered the country without documentation and as such did not have health insurance in Germany.
But the hospitals have denied the accusation that the refusal was based on his lack of insurance.
Spokespeople for the UKE hospital and the Albertinen hospital said that their operating rooms were being used at the point of the emergency and that they simply didn't have doctors available to operate on Steve O.
""Medical emergencies are always treated – regardless of the patient's insurance status,"" the Albertinen hospital spokesperson said.
""It wasn't possible for us to know that the time period for a transfer of the patient was so short,"" a spokesperson for the Asklepios hospital said. ""On the next day a transfer would have been possible. But by this time the patient was in no position to be moved.""
Steve O. had been taken in to the Asklepios Clinic in Wandsbeck for treatment on September 3rd, the day of his 55th birthday.
He was thought to have meningitis and was put in intensive care. At first his situation stabilized, but six days later doctors detected an inflammation in his heart valve. Because the Wandsbeck hospital did not have heart specialists, they tried to have him transferred.
The seriousness of his condition meant ""he needed to be handled by a heart specialist and his transfer into a specialist clinic became necessary,“ a spokesperson for the Wandsbeck Clinic told MOPO.
While refugees receive health insurance at the point of their registration in Germany, people who come to the country but do not register with authorities are not insured."

Prosecutors said he is ""strongly suspected"" of running the far-right website Migrantenschreck (Migrants' fright) between May and November 2016, which according to German media called on citizens to ""arm themselves against refugees"".

					06:46 CEST+02:00				",AFP,Merkel faces new gains by anti-migrant AfD in Berlin,"Berlin residents voted in state elections on Sunday, as a wave of protest voting against her welcome to refugees was expected to hit the hip, multicultural capital.
The right-wing populist Alternative for Germany (AfD) party has mobilised xenophobic and anti-Islam sentiment to win opposition seats in nine out of 16 states in Germany and is especially strong in the ex-communist east.
Fresh gains in long-divided Berlin -- where the AfD has polled 14 percent, a year ahead of national elections -- would spell another setback for Merkel, whose open-door policy brought one million asylum-seekers to Germany last year.
More than 70,000 of them came to Berlin, most still housed in refugee shelters including the cavernous hangars of the Nazi-built former Tempelhof airport, once the hub for the Cold War-era Berlin airlift.
Merkel -- who was booed with ""get lost"" cries by right-wing activists at a campaign event with her party's candidate Frank Henkel this week -- conceded that it was hard to reach the ""protest voters"" who have turned their backs on mainstream parties.
""
And still we have to try, again and again, because I think we must not give up on people who are casting protest votes,"" she said on RBB Berlin public radio.
On Saturday, in another tacit acknowledgement of the negative reaction to her migrant policy among some voters, she said she wanted to drop her ""we can do it"" rallying cry, much used last year to illustrate her welcoming stance on migrants.
""It's become a simple slogan, an almost meaningless formula,"" she told the Wirtschaftswoche financial weekly in an interview, adding: ""Some feel provoked (by the expression) which of course was not the idea.""
A strong showing for the AfD -- which was founded, originally as a eurosceptic fringe party, just over three years ago -- would hurt all major parties and continue a long-term fragmentation of the political spectrum.
Merkel's centre-right Christian Democrats (CDU) have a national majority but in Berlin serve as junior coalition partners to the centre-left Social Democrats (SPD) of Mayor Michael Mueller, traditionally the strongest party in the city of 3.5 million.
As Mueller has said he does not want to stay in a coalition with the CDU, Merkel's party may be cast out of the Berlin government altogether while the SPD instead teams up with the ecologist Greens and the far-left Die Linke party.
In a city famously dubbed ""poor but sexy"" by its previous mayor, the openly gay bon vivant Klaus Wowereit, the election campaign has been dominated not just by migrant policies but also widespread frustration over poor public services.
With little industry and an above the German average jobless rate of 10 percent, Europe's techno party capital is chronically broke and known for its crumbling schools, late trains and shambolic city offices.
Often seen as an amusingly chaotic exception in an otherwise orderly and punctual Germany, Berlin became a national laughing stock for a grand airport project that is now five years behind schedule and three times over budget.
A shortage of affordable housing has also become a hot-button issue as property prices and rents have shot up with an influx of 50,000 newcomers every year.
The top candidate meant to fix the mess is the SPD's Mueller, 51, who took over mid-term from Wowereit almost two years ago and is now seeking a popular mandate.
His main opponent is the CDU's Henkel, 52, who is running on a law-and-order platform that has seen mass police raids against anti-capitalist squatters, promises to clear streets and parks of drug dealers and demands to equip police with stun guns.
As the election has neared, the rise of the AfD has come to the fore again as a top concern, with Henkel telling the hecklers this week that ""I can't stand a party that tolerates racists in its leadership"".
The AfD, breaking a taboo in post-war German politics, has an openly anti-immigration platform, similar to France's National Front or far-right populists in Austria and the Netherlands.
It has also tapped into popular frustration with the two major parties, the CDU and SPD, who -- from Berlin's glass-domed Reichstag building -- rule Germany in a ""grand coalition"" with a crushing majority.
Mueller issued a passionate plea for voters to reject politicians with a ""worldview that is misanthropic and racist through-and-through"".
""Berlin overcame the Wall and shoot-to-kill orders and learnt the right lessons from a cruel history of suffering, persecution, terror and war,"" he wrote. ""Berlin today is the capital of freedom.""
He urged the city to ""once again take charge of its fate and prevent history from repeating itself.""

The idea is to team up African nations willing to reform with private investors who would bring business and jobs to a continent where instability or graft often scare off foreign companies.
Merkel is hosting the initiative as part of Germany's presidency of the Group of 20 powerful economies, whose leaders meet in the northern port of Hamburg a month later.
Invited to Berlin are Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and the leaders of Ghana, Ivory Coast, Mali, Niger, Rwanda, Senegal and Tunisia.
""In Africa, economic development needs to keep pace with the high and accelerating population growth and promise a future for young people, which would also help to ease migratory pressures,"" said Merkel's spokeswoman Ulrike Demmer.
Germany, Europe's largest economy, has taken in more than one million asylum seekers since 2015 -- more than half from war-torn Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan, but also many thousands from Ethiopia, Nigeria and elsewhere in Africa.
Hundreds of thousands more have trekked through the Sahara into lawless Libya, hoping that traffickers there will take them in rickety boats across the Mediterranean Sea to Europe.
Those who can't pay the thousands of dollars demanded by the people smugglers are often held in squalid militia-controlled facilities, which German diplomats have likened to ""concentration camps"".
'Demographic explosion'
Merkel last year visited major transit countries Mali and Niger as well as Ethiopia, the seat of the African Union, and pledged 27 million euros ($30 million) in aid aiming to stop migrants heading for Europe in the first place.
""The well-being of Africa is in Germany's interest"" Merkel said at the time.
Critics have dismissed the latest multilateral Africa initiative as a half-hearted effort without any aid commitment, but organisers say it could help boost prosperity and reduce the mass flight and brain drain, especially of young people.
Under the G20 ""compacts"" plan, an initial seven African nations will pledge reforms to attract more private sector investment.
Those countries will then receive technical support from the IMF, World Bank, other development institutions and their G20 partner country, which will also support the effort with its own companies.
Germany will team up with Ghana, Ivory Coast and Tunisia, while other G20 members will support efforts by Ethiopia, Morocco, Rwanda and Senegal.
More than 100 banks, companies and other potential investors are expected at the conference.
""This is not about hand-outs or just money or cheap money, but about the opportunity to attract investment, profits and jobs,"" said a German finance ministry official.
Non-government groups have criticised that the G20 club -- whose only member on the continent is South Africa -- is offering no financial commitments of its own, and that international trade often hurts African farmers and producers.
About 1,000 anti-globalisation protesters marched through Berlin on Saturday, waving signs that said ""Africa is not for sale"" and decrying the conference as a neocolonial grab for African resources at a time Europe wants to slam the door on its migrants.
The NGO One argued that it does little more than ""reiterate existing plans"" and remains ""insufficient, short-sighted and one-dimensional"".
With Africa's population expected to double by mid-century, it said that ""the G20 is not yet ready to face the demographic explosion that Africa will experience in the years to come."""

""This agreement will allow for the departure from Israel of 16,250 migrants to developed countries, such as Canada, Germany and Italy,"" Netanyahu said.
He made the announcement in televised remarks after Israel said it had scrapped a controversial plan to deport migrants to an unnamed African country and replace it with a new one that would see thousands sent to Western countries.
Thousands of others are to remain in Israel at least temporarily.
""The agreement stipulates that for each migrant who leaves the country, we commit to give temporary residence status to another,"" Netanyahu said.
Netanyahu in January announced the implementation of a programme to remove migrants who entered illegally, giving them a choice between leaving voluntarily or facing indefinite imprisonment with eventual forced expulsion.
According to interior ministry figures, there are currently some 42,000 African migrants in Israel, half of them children, women or men with families, who were not facing immediate deportation.
They are mainly Sudanese and Eritrean.
As the migrants could face danger or imprisonment if returned to their homelands, Israel offered to relocate them to an unnamed African country, which deportees and aid workers said was Rwanda or Uganda.
Netanyahu said in his remarks on Monday that he had to abandon the earlier plan because the option of sending them to a third country ""no longer exists"".
Rwanda and Uganda have said they would not accept those deported against their will.

""We must and will do everything to stop traffickers,"" she added.
Earlier her spokesman said Merkel, ""like millions of Germans"", was ""appalled"" by Sunday's capsizing of a fishing boat off Libya in which more than 700 people are feared dead, a few days after hundreds died in another incident.
The victims had ""started out -- desperate, perhaps also hopeful – for Europe, and the fact they now have only found death on the way, that is a tragedy,"" Steffen Seibert told reporters.
""That this is taking place with sad regularity in the Mediterranean, that is a situation not worthy of Europe. A continent which feels committed to humanity must look for answers even when there are no easy answers,"" he added.
EU interior and foreign ministers gathered in Luxembourg to discuss their response to the worsening crisis.
European politicians must urgently ask what can and must be done to prevent a repetition of such disasters at sea, Seibert said.
But he added they must also examine how ""the complicated internal political situation in Libya leaves people smugglers a completely free path for their criminal business"".
He said Merkel had called Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi on Sunday and the two agreed that Europe ""is to now act in this direction"".
Voices from across the German political spectrum had agreed on Sunday that a new answer was needed to the refugee crisis in the Mediterranean Sea, after news that the fresh catastrophe had cost 950 lives.
“We have to try and bring more stability to Libya... only that way can we stop Libya from continuing to be used by people smugglers and organizations,” Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier told ARD television.
“We have to stop the work of the people-smuggling gangs. That can only be done in international co-operation,” he added.
Fellow Social Democratic Party (SPD) member and vice-Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel said that “we can no longer allow that Europe all too often brings death rather than humaneness on its external borders.”
But Christian Democratic Union (CDU) Interior Minister Thomas de Maizière said that there were “no simple answers” because “criminal people-smuggling gangs earn a lot of money with the trips to and across the Mediterranean.”
Harald Höppner, a guest on political talk show Günther Jauch who plans to head to the Mediterranean and save refugees in a converted fishing boat called ""Sea Watch,"" surprised other guests by calling for a minute of silence during the Sunday evening broadcast.
The German voices joined a chorus from across Europe calling for something to change in the EU's border security policy.
“How many more times do we want to express our dismay and then go back to the [normal] order of the day?” asked European Parliament president Martin Schulz, adding that the next tragedy would be only a matter of time unless something changed.
SPD human rights spokesman and MP Frank Schwabe said that “whoever doesn't act now is guilty of failing to help.
“Anyone familiar with the figures knows that a successor mission to 'Mare Nostrum' [an Italian sea rescue programme in the Mediterranean ended in October 2014] wouldn't be an encouragement to refugees, but a necessary humane act.”
Mare Nostrum was brought to an end as increasing numbers of refugees from the Middle East and North Africa arrived in Italy, with other European countries reluctant to take on a share of the burden.
It was estimated to have saved around 140,000 lives according to a 2014 study by the European Council on Refugees and Exiles.

There were 16.3 million people with migrant roots living in Germany in 2012, according to the Federal Statistics Office. Of them, 10.9 million are people who have returned from abroad since 1949 and 5.4 million are the children of those returning migrants. Over 70 percent came from Europe and almost a third came from an EU member state. A further 15.7 of migrants came from Asia, 3.5 percent from Africa and 2.5 percent from the United States. Just 0.2 percent came from Australia or Oceania. Just over seven percent of people with migrant roots cannot be classified into any one category. This applies, for example, to children whose parents have different nationalities. A spokesman for the federal statistics office Destasis, which collated the data, told The Local there was an accepted definition of 'people with migrant roots' - migrationshintergrund in German. Obviously all migrants themselves count, as do their children - and any further generations who do not take German citizenship. Should the initial migrant get German citizenship, and their children be born as Germans in Germany, both of those first generations are counted as having migrant roots.
Only the second generation that has been born as Germans in Germany lose that label, he said. Migration to Germany surged at the end of the 1950's with the arrival of so-called ""guest workers"" to boost the country's post-war recovery. The 1980's saw an increase in the number of people seeking asylum in the country, while the following decade was characterized by the return of ethnic Germans from eastern Europe. More recently, the Eurozone financial crisis has attracted many southern Europeans into the country. While the portion of second generation migrants has undergone a significant rise, the number of people arriving in Germany exceeded that of second-generation migrants for the first time in 2012.

""If national budgets or the EU budget are insufficient, let's agree to set up, for instance, a tax of a certain amount on each litre of petrol,"" Schaeuble said.
""This way we would have the means for a European response to the refugee issue,"" he said, in an apparent reference to beefing up security at the European Union's outer borders in order to stop the migrant inflow.
""Finding a solution to the problem must not fail because of a lack of means.""
His petrol tax proposal however met with swift criticism even from within the ranks of his CDU conservative party -- also that of Chancellor Angela Merkel.
The party's vice president Julia Kloeckner, who claims to have talked with Merkel, said such an idea was indefensible because it tells taxpayers that it's up to them ""to pay the bill"" for refugees.
A business group within the party accused the finance minister of indirectly campaigning against welcoming the refugees, while the government's coalition partner the left-wing SPD party warned about playing one faction against the other.
Schaeuble said it was the New Year's Eve mass sexual assaults in Cologne on women blamed on Arab and North African men that had stepped up the pressure to find ""a solution to the problem of controlling the European Union's external borders.""
""The problem must be solved at a European level,"" he said.
""Otherwise, it won't just be Germany that suffers the consequences, as some seem to think, but our neighbours will be massively affected too, as will the Balkans, and all the way down to Greece.""
Contacted by AFP, the German finance ministry stressed that Schaeuble's comments were aimed at speeding things up.
""Things are moving too slowly in Europe,""Schaeuble told the newspaper, adding that he fully backed Merkel's efforts to solve the challenges posed by the migrant crisis.
""I support, with the full force of my convictions, what the chancellor says: we need to solve the problem starting from Europe's external borders,"" he said.
Otherwise, he added, ""Europe will find itself in an even bigger crisis."""

Berlin and Athens signed a deal at a recent EU migrant summit aimed at stemming arrivals to Germany and Austria - with some asylum seekers likely to be returned to the first EU country they reached, often southern Mediterranean states such as Greece and Spain.
Vitsas said the deal sought ""to find a uniquely European solution to regulate the migrant influx and limit unilateral actions.""
German Chancellor Angela Merkel has marketed the Greek accord and another with Spain as a way to placate hardline rebels within her government.
In return for processing the asylum applications of migrants who reached Germany, Berlin has promised to accept 2,900 migrants from Greece for family reunification, Vitsas said.
The minister said that arrivals from Turkey had fallen by 96 percent since their peak in the summer of 2015, but Greece is still struggling to look after some 60,000 migrants already on its territory.
He said Greece was dealing with ""problems with integration and housing"" for migrants, especially in overcrowded camps on the Dodecanese islands, just a short boat ride from Turkey.

Carrying flags bearing slogans like ""Refugees not welcome"", the crowd chanted ""Merkel must go"" as they railed against the almost 900,000 asylum seekers who arrived in Germany last year.
No violence had broken out so far at the rally, police said, while independent research group Durchgezaehlt estimated turnout at between 6,500 and 8,500 people -- far less than the 20,000 who joined the anniversary rally a year ago.
Pegida was forced to hold its anniversary gathering this year on Sunday rather than Monday -- when it usually holds its rallies, because two public events aimed at countering the Islamophobia group had already reserved the space in Dresden's old town.
City authorities were to hold a festival for residents tomorrow, while an anti-Pegida group had also called a rally at the same time to ""send a sign against the hate"" spouted by Pegida.
Short for ""Patriotic Europeans Against the Islamisation of the Occident"", Pegida was born in October 2014 with xenophobic marches every Monday evening.
At its peak the group attracted 25,000 to its protests in January last year before waning as its founder Lutz Bachmann was caught making overtly racist comments and as ""selfies"" of him sporting a Hitler-style moustache and hairstyle surfaced.
Bachmann was in May convicted of inciting racial hatred and fined nearly 10,000 euros for branding refugees ""cattle"" and ""scum"" on social media.
In early October, Pegida supporters sparked outrage when they heckled Chancellor Angela Merkel and President Joachim Gauck during German reunification celebrations in Dresden."

Italy has since Saturday requested that its EU peers take some of the migrants stranded aboard the Frontex ships off the Italian coast.
A German government spokeswoman said in a statement that ""Germany and Italy have agreed that, in view of the ongoing talks on intensified bilateral cooperation on asylum policy, Germany is ready to take in 50 people"".
Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte confirmed the deal on Sunday, writing on Facebook that 150 of the 450 migrants had now been accepted and the rest would soon be fairly distributed among other EU countries.
""This is the solidarity and responsibility we have always asked from Europe and now, after the results obtained at the last European Council, it is starting to become reality,"" Conte said.
""Let's continue on this path with firmness and respect for human rights.""
Conte had been in contact with his 27 EU peers, reminding them that they had agreed at their end-of-June summit on the need to share the migration burden.
Italy's new populist government, which came to power on June 1st, wants to block any further migrant arrivals by boat and has banned NGO rescue ships from docking in Italian ports, accusing them of aiding human traffickers.
The latest migrants, like thousands of others, had set sail from Libya in a single wooden vessel which was identified early Friday.
On Saturday morning, as the two Frontex vessels approached the boat, several migrants threw themselves overboard, prompting immediate efforts to rescue them, Italian sources said.
Eight women and children were taken to the Italian island of Lampedusa for medical treatment.
Spain's new foreign minister Josep Borrell meanwhile Sunday said that the EU's prized Schengen free-movement system was ""beginning to disappear"" under pressure from migrants arriving in the bloc.

The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) reported on Monday that net immigration in 2013 reached 437,000, a significant increase over the 370,000 recorded in 2012. That made Germany the destination for the second-highest number of migrants in the OECD, behind the US at almost one million and ahead of the UK at 291,000. The total number of people with a migrant background was around 16.3 million – or 20 percent of the German population. A major driver of the increase was the jump in people from other EU countries travelling to find work, which increased by over 130,000 in 2012 and again in 2013. The number of workers coming from non-EU countries increased more slowly, going up by 37,000 in 2012 and 21,000 in 2013. Authorities have been pushing new policies to integrate migrants into the workforce and attract qualified workers into the country as Germany faces a growing ageing population problem. New employment rules introduced in July 2013 mean that employers are now permitted to recruit non-EU workers for jobs where there is a skills shortage in Germany.
And most foreign university graduates are simply waved through as the country pushes to fill high-skill job vacancies. But Germany “must become better” at helping young people from migrant families into education and training, Chancellor Angela Merkel said at the opening of the national Integration Summit in Berlin. Although the country was already doing a lot, “the tempo could be raised” on introducing key reforms, Merkel said. Many people saw their applications to training positions refused simply for having a foreign name, the Chancellor added. The Integration Summit, which sees representatives from state governments, big business, unions and migrants' organizations invited to the Chancellery, is to focus heavily on access to education and training this year. Merkel and federal integration chief Aydan Özoguz earlier visited the Berlin Transport Companies (BVB) training centre to meet young people with migrant backgrounds.

The political art group calling itself ""Centre for Political Beauty"" had planned to march to Chancellor Angela Merkel's offices with what it said were the corpses of dead migrants and bury them outside.
After the Berlin authorities barred them from carrying out the plan, they knocked down security barriers in front of the nearby Reichstag parliament building.
There they used shovels to dig dozens of small plots and planted wooden crosses in the grass emblazoned with slogans such as ""Borders Kill"" and ""Fortresses Fall"".
They carried three caskets with them, but there were no bodies inside, a police spokesman told AFP.
Most demonstrators then complied with a police order to clear the area, but a ""small number"" of people were detained for disturbing the peace.
Activists from the group had staged a Berlin funeral on Friday for a Syrian refugee who they said died in the Mediterranean and whose body had been in cold storage in Sicily, Italy for the past six weeks.
It followed a similar burial at a Muslim cemetery in the German capital earlier in the week.
Critics say the group's project - which uses the slogan ""The Dead Are Coming"" - is macabre, tasteless and crosses ethical lines, but the organizers argue that it is casting the spotlight on an inhumane system.
Some 800 migrants died in a shipwreck in April, the worst disaster yet in the Mediterranean in a year in which an estimated total of 1,800 people have perished while trying to cross to Europe from Africa and the Middle East on flimsy boats."

Syrians made up the biggest group of newcomers, with 2,724 applicants in the month. Afghans were the second largest group with 2,063 migrants, followed by Iraqis with 1,853 arrivals.
Germany last year took in more than one million refugees and migrants, with the flow accelerating after Chancellor Angela Merkel in September suspended normal EU asylum rules to grant safe haven to people fleeing the Syrian war.
The mass influx sparked a backlash in Germany - which has since reintroduced temporary border controls and taken other steps to reduce numbers - and in eastern Europe, where a string of Balkan countries in early March shut their borders to refugees flocking in from Greece.
The EU has also since agreed on a controversial pact with Turkey to stop refugees crossing by boat to Greece.
Under the deal, Turkey has agreed to take back migrants who arrived in Greece after March 20.
In return, Europe has pledged that for every Syrian deported, it will accept one refugee from Turkey's vast camps, a move it hopes will discourage people from taking the highly risky journey across the Aegean sea."

Parents fear that attending a school with too many other foreigners could hinder their children's education.
On Wednesday preliminary results were released at a press conference in Berlin from the study entitled “Education, Background, Migration”. The study was conducted by the Heinrich Heine University in Düsseldorf on behalf of the Vodafone and Mercator Institutes. Professor Heiner-Barz from the university’s department of educational research told The Local: “Many parents would rather send their children to schools with fewer migrants because they think it will harm their children’s educational opportunities.” “Among other things, they worry that their children’s language skills will not develop properly,” he added. Barz said the results came as a surprise. “We thought that some parents would express these concerns, but not so many,” he said. For the study, 120 in-depth interviews were conducted with people from a variety of migrant backgrounds. All of the groups surveyed agreed that being a migrant in Germany limits your educational opportunities. From the interviews it emerged that most first- and second-generation migrants received little educational support from their parents. This was due to their parents’ low level of education, a lack of information on the German school system, inadequate language skills or too little money or time to properly help. “Cultural diversity is naturally a part of life for people with migrant backgrounds and is seen as a positive,” the study’s preliminary report said. “In terms of educational participation in Germany, however - especially in deprived areas - one’s own migrant background and that of one’s children is considered a deficiency and a problem.” The study’s project leader Meral Cerci told the Welt newspaper that parents want the German school system to be improved in two main ways. “For one they want to be better informed,” she said. “Many are hardly familiar with the German school system and therefore choose the closest school or one where they know some of the other pupils.” Parents would also like to see more teaching staff who themselves are from migrant families, the study found. Full results from the study will be published in December 2014.

Restrictions that barred residents from EU's two poorest states looking for jobs in some of its wealthiest members expired on January 1st, sparking fears by some of mass invasion and so-called ""benefits tourism"". Britain, where hundreds of thousands of immigrants have settled since the European Union first expanded into eastern Europe in 2004, in December rushed through legislation restricting EU migrants from claiming unemployment handouts. Germany, Europe's economic powerhouse where the minimum wage is about five times what it is in Romania and Bulgaria, is now also considering steps it could take. Days before the government of conservative Chancellor Angela Merkel is due to examine possible measures to make benefits abuse more difficult, Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel called for a debate on the issue. ""I think it's not necessary to exaggerate this issue. But it shouldn't be minimised either,"" he said in an interview with the Bild newspaper on Saturday. Gabriel and Merkel agreed in talks on Friday on the need for tougher measures against those abusing the country's generous welfare system. ""We don't need all-out discrimination of the Bulgarians and Romanians, but nor should we ignore the problems some big German cities face with the immigration of poor people,"" Gabriel said. ""Next Wednesday the government will objectively tackle this issue during the first ministerial meeting of the year,"" he said. Bulgaria and Romania joined the EU in 2007, becoming the bloc's poorest members. Wary of large numbers of jobseekers arriving from the two countries, several nations kept their job markets closed to Romanian and Bulgarian citizens for several years. The last of these restrictions expired on January 1st, including in some of the bloc's wealthiest nations -- Austria, Belgium, Britain, France, Germany, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands and Spain. Weeks before the expirations, Britain rushed through measures to limit so-called ""benefit tourism,"" by having new EU migrants wait for three months before applying for out-of-work payments and other benefits. The issue of eastern European immigration is a highly sensitive one in Britain, where the Labour government in power when the EU expanded east in 2004 vastly underestimated the number of new arrivals and admitted it should have done more to limit the influx. ""We had a pretty difficult experience when the eight countries joined a decade ago,"" Nigel Mills, a lawmaker from Prime Minister David Cameron's Conservative Party, told AFP. ""We had forecast 13,000 coming and more like a million came. It was pretty disastrous."" Like Britain, prosperous Germany also presents a strong lure to Romanian and Bulgarian migrants. The minimum wage for a 19 year-old there is the equivalent of $1,140 per month, compared with $232 in Romania and $208 in Bulgaria, according to the World Bank's 2014 economic profiles of the countries. In addition, the country has a generous welfare system, where any family with children legally residing in the country has a right to ask for state benefits. Bucharest and Sofia have slapped down the immigration fears, with both Romanian premier Victor Ponta and his Bulgarian counterpart Plamen Oresharski repeatedly saying in December that there would be no mass arrival of migrants from their countries on January 1st. In Sofia, President Rosen Plevneliev said in his New Year's Eve speech that Bulgarians ""would like to have a worthy job"" at home, and ""not to buy a one-way ticket and leave Bulgaria"".
Not all voices in Germany have been alarmist on the immigration issue. Germany, where the population is getting older, ""needs at least 1.5 million qualified foreign workers in the coming years to maintain its growth and to guarantee its social system,"" Martin Wansleben, the director of German Chamber of Commerce and Industry, was quoted as saying on Saturday in the ""Neue Osnabruecker Zeitung"" daily. ""We must continue to improve the reception of immigrations, it's a duty for the entire society,"" he said."

""Reducing the depth of this abyss of inequality must be one of the main tasks of the European Union.""
Faced with a crackdown by Libyan authorities and Italy's hardline approach to immigration, Spain has now become the main destination for people trying to get to Europe from Africa.
Sanchez said he and Merkel agreed to ""intensify dialogue and cooperation with countries of origin and transit"" of migrants, mainly Morocco.
He said they were in discussion with the European Commission to unlock aid that would allow Morocco to be much more effective in controlling its borders.

Saturday's meeting in the southern Andalusia region coincided with the entry into force of a deal under which Madrid pledged to take back migrants in Germany who had already been registered in Spain.
It is one of a series of bilateral agreements that Germany is seeking with EU partners, with Merkel under pressure to reduce the number of migrant arrivals to her country.
Berlin still hopes to persuade Italy and Greece to also accept the return of migrants who were registered on their soil before travelling to Germany.

Just one in three non-EU immigrants said they experienced problems when on the job hunt in Berlin, while in Stuttgart more than half said they quickly found work, daily paper Die Welt reported.
This contrasts with the experience of foreign students who are quitting Germany in droves according to a study last month which showed that even though 80 percent would like to stay, just 25 percent do.
Wednesday's study showed the worst places in Europe for foreigners looking for work included Portugal's capital Lisbon, where 79 percent said they encountered difficulties when trying to find employment, and Brussels where 71 percent of those looking for a job reported problems.
“People looking for work in the German job market have a much easier chance of finding work that matches their qualifications,” said co-author of the study Thomas Huddleston.
In Berlin, fewer than 18 percent struggled to work that suited their previous experience and training, while in Stuttgart this figure was 13 percent.
While temporary contracts were problematic for one in five immigrants in Germany, workers elsewhere cited the same problem – and they also reported large numbers of employers who were prepared to take on workers illegally. This increased pressure to take on illegal and thus unregulated and uninsured work.
This was a lesser concern in Germany, the study suggested.
More than 7,000 foreign workers living in 15 cities across seven EU counties were asked by the not-for-profit organisation, Migration Policy Group, about the problems they encountered when seeking work in their resident city.
Those asked in Germany were living in Berlin and Stuttgart – in both cities, just one in four said a language gap had been a major problem. In the giant French metropolises of Lyon and Paris, language proved much trickier, with nearly half saying their inability to speak French had hindered their hunt for work.
German government-funded language courses would seem to be working – with less than 10 percent immigrants asked saying they did not receive enough information about learning German, or had too little time.
In a similar report published on Tuesday by the German government looking into integration in the German workforce, more than 70 percent of employers asked said that the migrant workforce was important. More than 55 percent said they made a concerted effort to support integration.

It is unclear who is responsible for removing the ""Migrantenschreck"" website, but it is likely that its owner, Mario Rönsch, took it down himself, the Hamburg news site reported on Thursday.
The website once sold pistols, shotguns and semi-automatic weapons, which were delivered from Hungary to Germany.
One of the guns on offer was called “Migrant deterrent DP120 Bautzen” another “Antifa deterrent” - a reference to the left-wing Antifa movement.
The guns shoot rubber bullets capable of seriously injuring or even fatally wounding someone.
Die Zeit speculates that Rönsch became afraid after customs officials searched the premises of 29 of his customers a week ago.
In the raids, the customs officers found 42 illegal weapons. In total the website has sold 300 such weapons, according to data seen by the news site.
In December prosecutors in Berlin announced that they were investigating a 33-year-old man from Thuringia for running the website.
Before the site was taken down, it contained stories of crimes allegedly committed by migrants. In a video posted on the website, a man could also be seen firing bullets at posters of German President Joachim Gauck and Justice Minister Heiko Maas.
The website was based on a Russian server, making it more difficult for German authorities to take consequences against its owner."

Merkel and Seehofer reach late night deal on migrants,"German Chancellor Angela Merkel survived a bruising challenge to her authority with a compromise deal on immigration but faced charges Tuesday that it spelt a final farewell to her welcoming stance toward refugees.
In high-stakes crisis talks overnight, Merkel had put to rest for now a dangerous row with her hardline Interior Minister Horst Seehofer that had threatened the survival of her fragile coalition government.
In separate statements, Merkel praised the ""very good compromise"" that she said spelt a European solution, while Seehofer withdrew a resignation threat and gloated that ""it's worth fighting for your convictions"".
In a pact both sides hailed as a victory, Merkel and Seehofer agreed to tighten border controls and set up closed holding centres to allow the speedy processing of asylum seekers and the repatriations of those who are rejected.
They would either be sent back to EU countries that previously registered them or, in case arrival countries reject this -- likely including frontline state Italy -- be sent back to Austria, pending an agreement with Vienna.
CSU general secretary called the hardening policy proposal the last building block ""in a turn-around on asylum policy"" after a mass influx brought over one million migrants and refugees.
But criticism and doubts were voiced quickly by other parties and groups, suggesting Merkel may only have won a temporary respite.
Refugee support group Pro Asyl slammed what it labelled ""detention centres in no-man's land"" and charged that German power politics were being played out ""on the backs of those in need of protection"".
Bernd Riexinger of the opposition far-left Die Linke party spoke of ""mass internment camps"" as proof that ""humanity got lost along the way"" and urged Merkel's other coalition ally, the Social Democrats (SPD), to reject the plan.
SPD leader Andrea Nahles voiced cautious support but said her party needed to discuss ""many questions"" on the plan with its experts before holding a joint party meeting with the CDU/CSU bloc at 1600 GMT Tuesday.
One of the SPD's migration experts, Aziz Bozkurt, was withering, charging that the proposed holding centres would be ""impractical and fully on track with the AfD"" - the far-right party that has railed most loudly against immigrants.
'Toxic mood'
The deal announced overnight ended Merkel's worst crisis for now after she faced down an unprecedented mutiny by Seehofer, head of her party's traditional Bavarian allies the CSU.
A failure to defuse the open conflict would have threatened an end to their 70-year party alliance, a scenario which would have forced Merkel to find new partners or call fresh elections.
Top-circulation Bild daily - which had called the weeks-long battle ""Merkel's endgame"" after 12 years in power - gave a lukewarm welcome to the face-saving agreement.
""The CDU and CSU have now struck a deal they could have reached three years ago,"" it said, referring to the peak of the mass migrant influx in mid-2015.
""It's possible that this solution will work,"" Bild said in its commentary.
""But it's certain that the mood in a coalition has never been as toxic as in this one.""
The opposition pro-business Free Democrats (FDP) said they supported steps against such migration within the EU but also took a snipe, saying the deal's effectiveness remained ""completely open"".
The main problem was that it relies on pacts with other EU states that ""remain to be agreed at a future stage,"" said FDP parliamentary chief Marco Buschmann.
A question mark hovered over Merkel's hopes that Austria will willingly take back some of the rejected asylum seekers.
Austria's former defence minister Hans Peter Doskozil told Bild that he expected the government to reject an agreement that was ""bad for the EU and bad for Austria"".
Austria's Vice Chancellor Heinz-Christian Strache of the far-right Freedom Party warned last week that on the day Germany sends back migrants ""we will be ready and secure our own borders""."

					14:53 CET+01:00				",The Local,Germany named Europe's top migrant destination,"Germany has been named Europe’s principal country of destination for migrants, according to the World Migration Report (WMR) 2008 released on Tuesday.
As host to 10.1 million migrants in 2005, Germany was well ahead of the other top countries in the study by the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) on how globalisation is effecting human movement. France came in second with 6.5 million migrants, the United Kingdom had 5.4 million, Spain had 4.8 million, and Italy 2.5 million.
The ten countries reviewed in Europe all showed positive rates of growth in number of migrants from 2000 to 2005, but Spain and Italy recorded a stunning increase of 194.2 percent and 54.1 per cent respectively. Western and Central Europe hosted a total of 44.1 million migrants in 2005, many of whom came from neighbouring countries. That accounted for some 85 percent of the region’s population growth. Migrants make up an average of 15 percent of the population in Western European countries.
The WMR study found that there were more than 200 million international migrants worldwide – 2.5 times more than in 1965. Most countries are simultaneously states of migrant origin, transit and destination, making human mobility “a life choice driven by disparities in demography, income and employment opportunities across and within regions,” the report said.
""The world is on the move, there is no turning away from that,” Gervais Appave, Co-Editor of the WMR 2008 commented. “If we harness that mobility through policies addressing both human and economic needs, many of the migration anomalies of the past can be overcome and we would see real progress when we talk about global development.""
Meanwhile student mobility has increased by some 38.5 percent due to relaxed policies since 2001, with top destinations Britain, Germany and France getting 54 percent of the foreign students.
The IOM is an inter-governmental organisation that focuses on promoting “humane and orderly” migration."

The committee, made up of state secretaries from Germany's 16 Bundesländer, will attempt to smooth over an early spat within Germany's fledgling coalition government over immigration and look at ways of stopping migrants from abusing welfare payments. The Bavarian-based Christian Social Union (CSU), sister party to Merkel's CDU, argues unskilled immigrants from eastern Europe are coming to Germany to exploit the social security system. The party's comments came just days ahead of the January 1st lifting of restrictions on work permits for immigrants from Bulgaria and Romania in the rest of the EU. The claim unleashed a heated debate with new coalition partners the Social Democrats (SPD), which accused the CSU of populism. Widely seen as a bid to appease the CSU and their supporters, the new committee will look into how the government could stop poorer immigrants from other EU countries from exploiting Germany's generous benefits. Experts say the CSU's fears are unjustified, pointing to statistics showing Bulgarian and Romanian immigrants make up just a fraction of those drawing German Hartz IV unemployment benefits. In summer last year, just 0.6 percent of those living on Hartz IV payments were immigrants from Bulgaria and Romania, according to figures released this week by the Institute for Employment Research.
Although immigrants from those countries typically held fewer qualifications, figures showed the unemployment rate among this group was not only below the national average, but far below that of other migrant groups. However, a recent Forsa opinion poll suggests 60 percent of Germans believe fears that immigrants will exploit the system is justified, as opposed to 36 percent who think the concerns are overblown. Germany saw a boost to its population last year due to the biggest influx of immigrants in two decades, mainly from Europe's crisis-hit countries, according to official estimates published on Wednesday. The figures released by the federal statistics office Destatis showed that the number of people living in Germany had surged to 80.8 million in 2013 from 80.5 million - the third annual increase in a row. ""Once again, the high level of positive net immigration offset a lack of births,"" Destatis said in a statement. READ MORE: Germany mulls Bulgaria, Romania migrant influx"

""It is a problem for the entire European Union and therefore we argued for a special EU summit to be held next week,"" she said during a joint press conference with Austrian counterpart Werner Faymann. ""Donald Tusk will look into that.""
Striking back at critics of her refugee-friendly policy in recent weeks, the Chancellor added that ""if we must now begin to excuse ourselves for showing a friendly face in time of need, then this isn't my country.""
Merkel said it had been important to show support for refugees after the vicious anti-migrant demonstrations in the Saxon village of Heidenau in August.
While Germany and the EU find themselves in ""a not totally simple situation,"" she continued, the Union had always managed to find solutions in the past.
""I say again and again: We can manage this, and we will manage it,"" she said.
'Threats are not the right way'
Merkel also used the press conference to reject threats from Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere to cut EU funding to countries that refused to take in a share of refugees arriving in Europe.
Earlier on Tuesday, de Maiziere had said the government approved of using EU aid funds to pressure member states into accepting binding quotas to relocate 120,000 refugees, after several eastern countries refused the migrant distribution proposal.
""The negotiations situation is such that nothing happens to countries which refuse. We need to talk about ways of exerting pressure. These are often countries that receive a lot of structural funds from the European Union,"" de Maiziere told television network ZDF.
But Merkel warned that ""threats are not the right path"", insisting that ""once again, we must manage to create a European spirit"" around the refugee crisis.
Hopes of a quick, unanimous deal on distributing refugees across the bloc collapsed in the face of opposition from Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Romania at the crisis meeting of interior ministers in Brussels on Monday.
The crisis meeting of interior ministers in Brussels did formally agree however to launch a plan first proposed in May to relocate another 40,000 asylum seekers from Greece and Italy over the next two years.
Germany, which is expecting to receive up to a million asylum-seekers this year, has been pushing for other European countries to take their fair share of refugees.
Gabriel: Europe disgraced itself again
Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel said Tuesday that Europe ""disgraced itself"" when EU ministers failed to reach agreement on a quota plan to share the refugee burden.
""Europe once again disgraced itself yesterday,"" Gabriel said a day after EU ministers failed to reach unanimous agreement on a plan to take 120,000 refugees.
EU countries needed to understand that ""the whole of Europe is at stake"", he said, adding that ""what we are experiencing now threatens Europe far more than the Greece crisis"".
""Our country can't solve the refugee problems of half the world by itself,"" said Gabriel, who on Monday predicted Germany will receive as many as one million asylum seekers this year, up from the official forecast of 800,000.
Gabriel said that given the flood of refugees into Europe ""160,000 places is a drop in the ocean"", referring to the total number of people the bloc was debating taking.
He also suggested that EU aid funds be used to exert pressure on member states to accept binding quotas of refugees.
""Germany is not ready to be a net payer country in a Europe where everyone wants to join in when they get money, but are not willing to share the responsibility,"" he said."

Kurz, at 31 the world's youngest leader after forming a government with the far right last month, said following talks with Merkel that the debate about mandatory migrant quotas ""took up too much space"".
""I'm convinced that the solution to the migrant problem lies with decent border protection and stronger help in countries of origin,"" Kurz told reporters after he was received in Berlin with military honours.
While Merkel echoed those priorities, she also chided the member states that have refused to take in their share of migrants and refugees under the European Union's quota system.
When external border protection fails, ""it cannot be, in my view, that there are some countries that say 'we don't want to participate in European solidarity',"" she said. ""I believe that's wrong.""
Austria has sided with countries such as Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic that reject the scheme, agreed by a majority of EU leaders in 2015, to share 160,000 migrants around the bloc to help frontline states like Greece and Italy. Just some 32,000 were relocated by the end of 2017.
Kurz, who was Austrian foreign minister at the height of Europe's migrant crisis, was one of the fiercest critics of Merkel's contentious decision in 2015 to open Germany's borders to those fleeing conflict.
The move prompted an influx of nearly 900,000 asylum seekers to Germany that year alone, although arrivals have slowed significantly since then.
Kurz came to power after taking over the conservative People's Party (ÖVP) last year and yanking it to the right, with a hardline stance on immigration.
His government is the only one in Western Europe to feature the far right after he struck an alliance with the controversial Freedom Party (FPÖ).
Merkel stressed the ""close cooperation"" between Germany and Austria and their shared positions on many issues.
She said she would judge the new government in Vienna ""by its actions"", but added that she would be watching closely.
""We will keep an eye on everything else - perhaps I will a bit more than I would have otherwise done. But what matters are actions,"" she said."

conservative Bavarian allies vowed a final attempt at a deal on migrant policy after she was unmoved by her interior minister's offer to resign.
""I said that I would vacate both my offices (as federal interior minister and CSU party chief) in the next three days,"" Horst Seehofer told reporters in Munich.
Before that deadline runs out, he would speak with Merkel's CDU Monday afternoon ""in hopes of reaching an understanding"" that would shape his decision on whether to stay on, he added.
At a closed-door meeting with fellow party chiefs, Seehofer had earlier complained he had ""no support"" after failing to convince Merkel of his plan to turn away asylum seekers registered in other European countries.
But other party bosses refused to accept his departure and kept strategy talks going until the early hours. With Seehofer now making his political future dependent on the outcome of the talks, questions linger about the future of Merkel's governing coalition between the CDU-CSU alliance and the centre-left Social Democratic Party (SPD).
If Merkel holds firm and he does quit, the CSU could offer a replacement interior minister if it aims to remain tied to her party.
Alternatively it could break up the two parties' decades-long partnership, depriving Merkel of her majority in parliament and pitching Germany into uncharted political waters.
To politically survive, Merkel could attempt a minority government, seek a new coalition partner in the ecologist Greens or pro-business Free Democrats, or orchestrate a no-confidence vote in parliament that could trigger new elections.
Apparently unafraid of the risks, the CDU on Sunday offered its sister party no outstretched hand in the fight over a European approach versus unilateral national measures to slash migrant numbers.
CDU general secretary Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer said in Berlin party leaders were ""united"" behind ""effective, humane solutions together with our European partners"".
Secondary migration
After the Bavarians' relentless pressure on Merkel, European leaders on Friday agreed new measures to reduce immigration and so-called ""secondary migration"" of asylum-seekers between countries.
Merkel, who has been in office since 2005, warned last week the issue of migration could decide the future of the EU.
Leaders said they would consider setting up ""disembarkation platforms"" outside the EU, most likely in North Africa, in a bid to discourage migrants and refugees boarding EU-bound smuggler boats.
Member countries could also create processing centres to sort economic migrants from refugees.
At the national level, Merkel also proposed that migrants arriving in Germany who first registered in another EU country should be placed in special ""admissions centres"" under restrictive conditions.
A document she sent to the CSU and SPD also outlined deals with 16 other countries to return already-registered migrants if they reached Germany. Sources said Seehofer rejected Merkel's assessment that the EU-wide measures would ""have the same effect"" as his demand to turn away at the border
asylum-seekers already registered in other EU nations.
That left him with only three options.
He could defy her orders by ordering border police to carry out his plan, which would force her to fire him and almost certainly break up the CDU-CSU alliance, or he could accept a humiliating climbdown or resign.
As the CDU and CSU parties hunkered down in Berlin and Munich, leaders on both sides sought to clarify what was at stake.
""It's not about who comes out on top, but about what's right,"" Bavarian state premier Markus Söder told the CSU gathering, according to news agency DPA.
Meanwhile for Merkel's troops, ""the image of the country, our ability to act and our ability to govern"" were on the line, said economy minister and close Merkel ally Peter Altmaier.
Merkel-bashing
The chancellor's EU push was ultimately prompted by the CSU's fear of losing its cherished absolute majority in Bavaria's state parliament.
The ""Union"" of CDU and CSU fused the southern state's beer-and-lederhosen-infused conservatism with more moderate politics, forming a centre-right force that dominated Germany for decades.
Political stability was upset by Merkel's 2015 decision to keep borders open to migrants and refugees arriving from the Middle East via the Balkans, Hungary and Austria.
Since then, more than one million people have arrived in Germany, while Merkel's governments have repeatedly tightened immigration and asylum laws.
Nevertheless, the anti-refugee, anti-Islam Alternative for Germany (AfD) surged into federal parliament for the first time last year, leading to months of paralysis while Merkel struggled to put together a workable coalition.
Opinion polls point to the AfD making a similar entrance to Bavaria's regional parliament in October.
Weeks of ""Merkel-bashing"", however, have failed to help the CSU, as a Forsa poll last week showed around 68 percent of Bavarians backed Merkel's quest for a Europe-wide answer to migration rather than Germany going it alone."

The study, “Fertility of Immigrants: A Two-Generational Approach in Germany”, found that children born in Germany to immigrant parents barely have more children than native Germans, daily Die Welt reported Wednesday.
“Women of the second generation have nearly matched German women in their fertility patterns,” said study author Nadja Milewski from the University of Rostock.
This is despite the fact that they get married on average two years younger than native Germans and become mothers correspondingly earlier.
Milewski's finding appears to be a further blow to Germany's demographic prospects, which are considered to be bleak because of the country's low birthrate. It also tears apart the anti-immigration thesis that native Germans will eventually be a minority in the country.
Milewski studied extensive data gathered on more than 5,000 West German women between 1984 and 2004, along with immigrant women from the first and second generations from Turkey, southern Europe and southeastern Europe.
By the time the women were 35, some 18.5 percent of them had three or more children – but this figure was just 15 percent for second-generation women from Greece and 15.4 percent for women from the former Yugoslavian countries.
Although second generation women from Italy and Turkey did more commonly have three or more children – 33.3 percent and 34.2 percent respectively – the numbers had clearly dropped between the first and second generations. Some 58.8 percent of first generation Turkish women had three or more children, as did 43.6 percent of Italian women."

The report found that while there is a small group of elite, immigrant youngsters who are gaining high qualifications, there is a growing number who have virtually no prospect of gaining an apprenticeship or training place after school – and therefore little chance of entering the job market.
The 13.3 percent of immigrant children aged 15 to 19 who are leaving without a certificate is a sharp rise on the 10.8 percent in 2005 and 10 percent in 2007.
It is also a problem among the broader German population, the report says, with the number of students leaving without any qualification climbing across the board from 5.4 percent in 2005 to 7 percent.
The report follows the recent release of a damning report that found that just one-tenth of students from immigrant backgrounds graduated from elite, university-track high schools under Germany's tripartite school system.

Researchers found that, on average, a migrant in Germany without German citizenship paid €3,300 more into the social funding than they use, resulting in €22 billion in the pot in 2012. That surplus per capita has risen by more than 50 percent over the last decade. The authors wrote that the result dispels the myth that the 6.6 million immigrants are a burden on the social system. They said that further generations can only benefit from more migration. However, A survey done in 2012 showed that two-thirds of Germans think migration is a strain on the German economy. Unsurprisingly, the study found that the better educated the migrant, the bigger contribution was made to Germany's tax payments.
""Education policy is the best integration policy,"" said Jörg Dräger, head of the Bertelsmann Foundation.

The vote during the CDU party conference signals the party's intention to reverse a compromise that the CDU agreed to with its coalition government partner the Social Democrats (SPD) in 2014.
The CDU and SPD agreed to change the law as of December 2014 to allow immigrant children to keep both German citizenship and that of their parents.
The reform entails certain requirements for those who want to maintain their dual citizenship, such as showing proof that they had lived in Germany for eight years, or attended a German school for at least six years.
Previously children born to foreign parents from certain countries were allowed to have dual citizenship up until the age of 23, but then had to choose which nationality they would keep.
But Merkel herself criticized her party's vote to undo the reform.
""We should not go back on this law,"" Merkel told broadcaster N-tv.
The law particularly affects the large Turkish minority in Germany, many of whom came over through a guest worker programme started in the 1960s. But it also applies to children of parents from many non-EU countries.
Before the reform was passed, exceptions were made for children of parents from other EU states, Switzerland and countries that do not allow people to renounce their citizenship, like Iran. But still an estimated 40,000 young people were having to choose between nationalities each year.
The CDU vote was close: 319 for and 300 against.
Interior Minister Thomas de Maizière said during the debate that he did not believe it was good to go back on an agreed compromise, adding that any party that the CDU will try and build a coalition with after the 2017 election will not accept a reversal of the legislation.
Fellow CDU member Jens Spahn applauded the vote and said that while the party must make compromises within a coalition, “we are here at a party conference”. He added that it is not unreasonable to ask young people to make a clear choice."

In families where little or no German is spoken in the home, the children often have a hard time keeping up with native speakers in the schoolroom, and more of them are needing crash language courses to get them up to speed, figures suggest.

“In some regions, nearly half of all children need targeted language tuition,” Maria Böhmer, the German government's Commissioner for Integration told Bild. “It's a big task. It has to be given top priority everywhere.”
Every child must be able to speak German well enough to follow lessons when they start school, said Böhmer, which is why language support was important from the very beginning.
Those who can't speak German, she said, are just “passive onlookers in our country.”

					08:49 CEST+02:00				",AFP,Erdogan accuses EU of not paying up under migrant deal,"Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Monday accused the EU of not paying its way under a deal to send Syrian refugees back across the Aegean.
Ankara and Brussels signed a controversial deal in March, in which Turkey agreed to take Syrian migrants landing on Greek islands in exchange for political and financial incentives.
The deal included billions of euros in aid and visa-free travel for Turks in Europe, but ties have been strained by Erdogan's massive crackdown after a failed coup this month.
The president said the EU had promised $3 billion, but so far only paid a nominal $1 million to $2 million.
""The [European] governments are not honest,"" Erdogan told German public television station ARD.
""Three million Syrians, or people from Iraq, are now in Turkey,"" he said.
""The EU has not kept its promises on the matter.""
Erdogan estimated the refugees, many of whom have fled the devastating five-year civil war in neighbouring Syria, have cost Turkey $12 billion.
The EU made the deal with Turkey to temper a huge influx of more than a million migrants which overwhelmed the bloc last year.
Late last month, Brussels said it had opened a new negotiating chapter with Turkey on its long-stalled bid for membership of the bloc.
But that bid has been hit by Erdogan's sweeping crackdown in the wake of the failed July 15 military takeover, which has seen more than 13,000 people detained.
The president repeated his call for capital punishment for the plotters, an issue that has perturbed the EU, saying: ""The people want the death penalty reinstated.""
""We as a government need to hear what the people say,"" he added.
Turkey abolished the death penalty in 2004 as part of its bid to join the EU."

					12:37 CEST+02:00				",AFP,Few foreigners in eastern Germany but xenophobia is rife,"A social worker in the drab eastern German city of Frankfurt an der Oder admits she feels isolated at work whenever talk turns to the country's record influx of refugees.
""I have to say that my colleagues are not very friendly towards foreigners and I am almost alone in my opinion,"" Elisabeth, who gave just her first name, told AFP.
Foreigners are rarely seen in the former communist city about 100 kilometres (60 miles) east of Berlin, but as in much of eastern Germany, there is deep suspicion toward migrants.
With its attacks on Chancellor Angela Merkel's decision to let in around a million asylum seekers since 2015, the right-wing populist Alternative for Germany (AfD) party has found fertile ground in the east.
At the last state elections in 2014, before Germany's migrant crisis erupted, the AfD won 11 seats in the state assembly of Brandenburg, where Frankfurt an der Oder is located.
Police commissioner Wilko Moeller, who leads the city's local chapter of the AfD, noted that the region offers ""great potential"" for his protest party.
In an illustration of how favourable the climate is for the AfD, its deputy chairman Alexander Gauland is running for a national seat in Frankfurt an der Oder in the September 24th general elections.
'Far too many migrants'
With its tall concrete residential blocks in the centre of town, Frankfurt an der Oder, at the border with Poland, has struggled to shed its ex-communist yoke.
Like other parts of the eastern region, the city has been losing population.
Once home to 87,000 inhabitants, a quarter-century later only 58,000 people are left as many have moved west in search of better opportunities.
The unemployment rate stands at 10 percent, far above the 5.9 percent rate nationwide.
And even if foreigners make up just over one percent of the city's population, some 1,400 people - half of them asylum seekers who arrived in 2015 - many locals still feel that's too many.
A retiree, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said: ""I don't think refugees should have been allowed in like that. Even if we are a social country, we have our own problems.
""I am not xenophobic, but that was far too many.""
Her sentiment is mirrored across much of Germany's five states in the former communist east, where the number of jobless is higher than the western average and where few migrants are seen on the streets.
Even in 2015 - when the mass migrant influx brought the total number of foreigners in Germany to 9.1 million - only 476,000 made their home in the east, according to official data.
'Structural racism'
Hajo Funke, a political scientist at Berlin's Free University, said eastern Germany suffers from a ""structural"" problem of racism.
The former East Germany ""was an authoritarian regime that was not very open to diversity and which did not seek to integrate foreigners,"" he said.
Following reunification in 1990, resentment also built up over the economic gap with western Germany as new prosperity failed to materialise quickly enough, he said.
Just two years later in 1992, race riots rocked the eastern coastal city of Rostock, with mobs flinging petrol bombs and stones at an apartment block housing migrants while thousands of bystanders applauded.
More recently, the anti-Islam PEGIDA movement was born in the biggest city in the east, Dresden, and the proportion of assaults against shelters for asylum seekers has been far higher than in the west.
The neo-Nazi party NPD also has some 264 elected municipal officials in the east, compared with 74 in the west.
Funke noted that the Rostock riots became a template of violence for a generation that grew up during the turbulent reunification years, and became drawn to the extremist movement.
But the AfD's Moeller rejects any racist view of east Germans, saying it is disillusionment that has pushed them to the right.
Reflecting its voter base, Moeller's AfD office is located not in the town centre, but in the working class district of Neuberesinchen, where Gerd, 61, lives.
Smoking a cigar at the foot of a decrepit building with peeling paint, Gerd, who is a far-left Linke party voter, nevertheless defended the AfD.
""They don't want the Nazis to come back,"" he said. ""They don't want a Hitler either.""
Thomas Klaehn, who works with a migrant aid group, believes that those who deny they are racist while rejecting migrants ""often have had no contact with refugees"".
""But if someone manages to put them in contact and build a positive relationship, then they could be brought over to the side of 30 percent who are for them.""

Trump waded into the political crisis facing Chancellor Angela Merkel, declaring that the German people were ""turning against their leadership"" over immigration.
""We don't want what is happening with immigration in Europe to happen with us!"" he said in a pair of tweets.
""The people of Germany are turning against their leadership as migration is rocking the already tenuous Berlin coalition,"" he said, adding that ""crime in Germany is way up. Big mistake made all over Europe in allowing millions of people in who have so strongly and violently changed their culture!""
The people of Germany are turning against their leadership as migration is rocking the already tenuous Berlin coalition. Crime in Germany is way up. Big mistake made all over Europe in allowing millions of people in who have so strongly and violently changed their culture!
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 18, 2018
Trump's comments came as Merkel was fighting to save her coalition government amid demands by her interior minister to turn back immigrants at the border.
Is crime ‘way up'?
Whether it is appropriate for him to say so or not, Trump is right in his claim that a fight over asylum laws is rocking the German government. Merkel's future as Chancellor has never looked so uncertain after Interior Minister Horst Seehofer reportedly said he couldn't work with her any more.
The US President is also right when he says the German population has turned against Merkel on this issue. Opinion polling shows that a majority of the public support Seehofer, who wants to turn back asylum seekers at the border who have already been registered in other EU countries.
But his assertion that “crime in Germany is way up” is simply not true. Crime figures for last year show a drastic drop in reported crime. Most types of crime - including violent crime - fell in 2017, meaning it was actually the year with the least reported crime in three decades.
While reported crime is a far from reliable way of calculating actual crime, it is also the only method that currently exists of tracking nationwide crime trends.
Trump also asserts that refugees have “strongly and violently” changed German culture. What exactly he means by this is not clear. German beer consumption has dropped in recent years but we haven't seen any refugees ripping Maßes from their hands at Oktoberfest. Last time we checked they were also still fans of Bratwurst and bad pop music.
There is a serious debate to be had on crime linked to asylum seekers. Several politicians from moderate parties such as the Greens and the Christian Democrats have stuck their heads above the parapet and pointed out that asylum seekers are over-represented in crime statistics.
SEE ALSO: Why are refugees disproportionately likely to be suspects in sexual assault cases?
Meanwhile German newspapers have started to tentatively talk about the prevalence of refugees as suspects in sexual assault cases.
A serious question to ask is whether Germany takes the connection between asylum seekers and certain types of crime seriously enough. But stating that crime is “way up” due to refugees in a highly irresponsible distortion, especially when it comes from the President of the US.
This also isn't the first time Trump has been guilty of exaggerating the crime rate in Germany.
In 2016 he said that “you know what a disaster this massive immigration has been to Germany and the people of Germany. Crime has risen to levels that no one thought they would ever, ever see. It is a catastrophe.”
He made that statement when the latest crimes figures (those for 2015) showed that recorded crime per head in Germany had dropped from 7,337 crimes per 100,000 resident to 7,301 per 100,000 residents.

					01:42 CET+01:00				",AFP,"African, EU states focus anti-trafficking efforts at source","Thirteen African and European countries and the EU agreed Friday that efforts to crack down on migrant trafficking to Europe should also focus on economic woes that prompt poor Africans to seek a better life in Europe.
In ministerial-level talks, they agreed to ""attack underlying causes of irregular migration,"" according to a joint statement.
""The economic problem... is also the basis for the migration phenomenon,"" Niger Interior Minister Mohamed Bazoum said.
The countries also vowed to strengthen national laws to prosecute traffickers and improve coordination among police and judiciary in fighting human smuggling.
The one-day ""conference on coordination of the struggle against traffickers of migrants"" took place against a backdrop of renewed concern in Europe over illicit migration, three years after a massive human influx led to a rise in xenophobia and far-right populism in several EU states.
It was attended by ministers from Burkina Faso, Chad, Guinea, Ivory Coast, Libya, Mali, Mauritania, Niger and Senegal, with representatives from France, Germany, Italy and Spain, the European Union and United Nations.
The communique called for ""developing the conditions for an economy to emerge that is an alternative to the underground economy of illicit trafficking of migrants."" To achieve this requires ""an overall approach, with solidarity,"" it said.
Reflecting the issue's priority, France sent two senior ministers -- Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian and Interior Minister Gerard Collomb, who urged participants to take action ""as close as possible to the countries of origin.""
Niger, one of the large nations lying south of the Sahara in West Africa, has become one of the main routes for African migrants heading north to the Mediterranean coast in the hope of crossing to Europe.
Collomb said because of a series of preventive measures taken by Niger, the number of Europe-bound migrants passing through the country had ""dropped drastically"" from 330,000 in 2016 to 70,000 last year.
""If all the countries put such measures in place we can reduce the number of arrivals in Europe,"" he said.
Two Africa-EU summits in 2017 put the focus on training police and paramilitary gendarmerie forces, help with conducting border checks and the creation of identity databases.
Europe's part in taking on irregular migration in Africa gained force with ""migratory pacts"" signed in 2015 in Valetta, capital of Malta, which built on previous accords to reach a global approach dating back to 2006.
One of the challenges, in the eyes of French delegates, is to persuade African countries to agree more readily to provide documents enabling the return of their nationals who lack the required papers.
The French parliament is due in coming months to debate a government bill on immigration, which has already made waves among some supporters of the government who consider the new measure too severe."

“A doctor from another country must be able to do more than order pizza during the night shift,” he said on Saturday at the annual meeting of the association.
He said at the very least doctors should be able to write comprehensible letters and put together recommendations for treatment – something which could involve employers putting a migrant doctor through several months of language lessons and training in the German health care system.
“No doctor from abroad should be given a license to practice in Germany if he or she is not at least at this level,” he said.

The group, aged between 15 and 25, including 3 women, were detained following the assault in the early hours of Sunday morning.
Police did not give the names or nationalities of the suspects or the victim, but German daily Welt had reported that all involved are Syrians.
Police said the victim had approached the group in a park to borrow a lighter, but his cigarette was snatched away.
The 25-year-old was wearing a chain with a star of David, which police said was ripped from the victim's neck by one of the men, while spewing ""anti-Semitic insults.""
The attacker allegedly repeatedly punched the victim in the face, before fleeing.
The victim was treated in a hospital after suffering cuts to the head.
Police added that the 3 female suspects aged 15 to 21 and 7 men aged 17 to 25 were subsequently released, but that a special branch of investigators dealing with politically motivated crimes have taken over the case.

The defendant, a 19-year-old Palestinian from Syria, is charged with dangerous assault and hate speech in the trial that was to hear eight witnesses and could reach a verdict the same day.
The footage of the April 17th assault shows the attacker, one of a group of three, shouting ""yahudi"", Jew in Arabic, before lashing out at the two men, leaving one injured.
""I'm sorry, it was a mistake"", the defendant told a Berlin court, while claiming the victim had insulted him first, reported news agency DPA.
""I didn't want to hit him, I only wanted to scare him,"" he said in his testimony, which switched from halting German to Arabic.
""I had smoked some dope, my head was tired.""
Grievous bodily harm usually carries jail terms of three months to five years in Germany, but less under juvenile law which can be applied for defendants up to 20 years of age.
Bild daily has identified the belt attacker as Knaan al-S., who was registered at a refugee home in Brandenburg state outside Berlin but went on to live ""out of a suitcase"" in the capital.
The victim who shot the video, a 21-year-old student, later revealed that he is not Jewish but an Israeli Arab called Adam, who was walking at the time with a German-Moroccan friend aged 24.
Adam told public broadcaster Deutsche Welle that they had wanted to test whether wearing a kippa was safe in the fashionable inner Berlin district of Prenzlauer Berg.
He said he had uploaded the video ""for the police, the German people and the world to see how terrible it is these days to walk through Berlin streets as a Jew"".
'Eternal responsibility'
The attack was the latest to raise alarm bells about renewed anti-Semitism in Germany from both the far-right and a large influx of predominantly Muslim asylum seekers since 2015.
The Alternative for Germany party, which captured nearly 13 percent of the vote in September's general election, has broken a taboo by repeatedly challenging Germany's ""remembrance culture"" and atonement for the Nazi era.
Party member Bjoern Höcke has called Berlin's Holocaust memorial a ""monument of shame"", and AfD co-leader Alexander Gauland described the Nazi period as little more than a ""speck of bird shit in over 1,000 years of successful German history"".

The belt attack coincided with another public outcry, over a rap duo who made light of Nazi death camp prisoners but went on to win the music industry's sales-based Echo award, which was subsequently axed.
After the belt attack, the head of the Jewish community in Germany, Joseph Schuster, said that Jews should avoid wearing religious symbols in big cities due to a heightened risk of targeted attacks.
The advice earned him a rebuke from the Nazi-hunting Simon Wiesenthal Center and the European Jewish Association, whose head Rabbi Margolin argued that to not wear the kippa ""fulfils the vision of anti-Semites in Europe"".
Days after the assault, some 2,000 people rallied at a ""Berlin Wears Kippa"" solidarity demonstration, matched by smaller events in Cologne, Potsdam, Magdeburg and Erfurt.
Chancellor Angela Merkel, in an interview with Israeli television, denounced the emergence of ""another form of anti-Semitism"" beyond that of right-wing extremist groups, from Muslim refugees.
She reaffirmed that the security of Jews and the state of Israel was a central concern for Germany because of its ""eternal responsibility"" for the Holocaust in which the Nazis murdered six million European Jews.

A spokesman for the local government of Bornheim said on Friday that the ban on male asylum seekers above the age of 18 came after six people filed complaints ""over the sexually offensive behaviour of some migrant men at the pool"".
The measure aimed at ""making it clear to the men that the rights of women in Germany is inviolable"", he added.
Officials have gone personally to three asylum seeker shelters near the pools to deliver news of the ban and emphasize how people should behave in swimming pools, said the spokesman.
The town, situated on the west bank of the Rhine River, would revoke the ban once it deems that the message has been drilled into the asylum seekers, he said, adding that this would be evaluated through interviews with social workers at the shelters.
Authorities denied placing entire groups of people under suspicion, but said the measure was aimed at laying down clear ground rules.
Munich pools issue ground rules for migrants
Meanwhile in Bavaria, swimming pools have issued leaflets with simple pictorial instructions on behaviour for migrants who may never have swum in public before.
The leaflets are available in multiple languages, including Arabic, French, Pashto and Somali, and include safety and behaviour tips in a comic book style.

Particular emphasis is placed on stopping physical and verbal harassment of women, with images showing a red ""no"" symbol over an outstretched hand reaching for a woman in a bikini.
A Munich city spokesman told DPA that officials conceived the leaflets in 2013 after increasing numbers of problems in the city's 18 public swimming pools.
""The ground rule of respect for women – whatever clothing they're wearing – is unfortunately not respected by all our swimmers. That's why there is an explicit indication about it,"" the spokesman said.
Public disquiet growing in Germany
Public distrust of asylum seekers has grown in Germany after it emerged that hundreds of women were groped and robbed in a throng of mostly Arab and North African men during New Year's festivities in Cologne.
An opinion poll for public television ARD found that 48 percent of respondents said they were afraid of refugees, while 50 percent said they did not feel that way.
A separate poll for public broadcaster ZDF also found that seven in ten people fear that a record influx of asylum seekers will lead to more crime, compared to 62 percent in October.
Germany took in 1.1 million asylum seekers in 2015, mostly from Syria, Afghanistan and Iraq.

However, the claim included in the document that Germany has secured deals with 14 EU member states to take back asylum-seekers already registered in those countries was quickly thrown into doubt. Two of the countries mentioned -- Hungary and the Czech Republic -- denied that any such deal had been reached.
Merkel's move came after the European Union's 28 members hammered out a hard-fought deal Friday to tackle migration and avert a crisis that has threatened the very fabric of the bloc.
At a summit in Brussels, the European leaders agreed to consider setting up ""disembarkation platforms"" outside the EU, most likely in North Africa, in a bid to discourage migrants and refugees boarding EU-bound smuggler boats.
Member countries could also create processing centres to determine whether the new arrivals are returned home as economic migrants or admitted as refugees in willing states.
Merkel's government has been sent to the brink over the issue, facing a rebellion by her Interior Minister Horst Seehofer of the conservative CSU who has threatened to unilaterally turn back migrants at the border.

But she announced after the EU summit that she had also reached separate agreements with Spain and Greece on taking back asylum-seekers.
According to the document seen by coalition sources, Merkel secured similar deals with a total of 14 countries including France and central European states that were fiercely critical of her migrant policies, such as the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland.
But Budapest and Prague, strongly opposed to accepting migrants, were having none of it.
""Germany has not addressed us and I will not sign this agreement,"" Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis said in a statement.
""No negotiations have taken place between the Czech Republic and Germany on this question,"" he added.
Bertalan Havasi, a spokesman for Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, stressed that Budapest's position ""remains unchanged since 2015"".
""No asylum-seeker can enter Hungarian territory if the asylum-seeker has already entered Greece or another member state,"" he said.

The announced deals will be discussed on Sunday at key meetings of Merkel's own CDU party and also of the CSU that are likely to determine the fate of her government.
Merkel, now barely 100 days into her fourth term, faced a backlash from the conservative CSU after allowing more than one million asylum-seekers into Germany since 2015.

He told migration authorities he was 17 and that his father was killed in Afghanistan. But now his father, alive and well in Iran, has told the court his son is 33.
Prosecutors were able to track down Hussein K.’s father when they came across a contact on his mobile phone. The defendant told them that they could contact his mother on the number. But when an interpreter called the number in the presence of two judges, the person who picked up was his father.
The older man read out details from his son’s birth certificate which state that he was born on January 29th 1984, presiding judge Kathrin Schenk said in the district court in Freiburg on Friday.
Hussein K. had told German immigration authorities that he had fled Afghanistan after his father was killed in battles with Taliban fighters. Due to the fact that he also said he was 17, he was treated by German authorities as an unaccompanied minor and given foster parents.
But there have been some doubts raised about the father’s testament as the interpreter said he could have been referring to the Persian calendar, which would have to be recalculated.
Previous analysis of a tooth belonging to the defendant also suggests he is at least 22 years of age.
The new evidence could be of crucial importance in determining how long Hussein K.’s sentence will be if he is found guilty. If the judges decide that he was a minor at the time of the crime, he will face a lesser sentence than if he is found to have been an adult.
The defendant has already admitted to raping and strangling his victim until she lost consciousness late at night in a Freiburg park. A postmortem found that she drowned in the river Dreisam.
Hussein K. arrived in Germany in November 2015 without proper documentation. He had already been sent to jail for pushing a young woman from a cliff in Greece, but was released early. He then fled his parole to Germany and Greek authorities failed to issue an international arrest warrant for him.
A verdict on the trial is expected early next year."

The initial police report states that explosives experts are on their way to the scene but that they do not believe there was any explosive substance in the suitcase, saying it was more likely aerosol cans which had been packed inside.
Police are now searching for a man and a woman who they believe to be behind the scare.
Reuters had initially reported that the explosion happened outside a reception centre for refugees in Zirndorf, a western suburb of Nuremberg in northern Bavaria.

					08:07 CEST+02:00				",AFP,"Merkel, Hollande discuss migrant crisis, Ukraine","German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Francois Hollande will meet in Berlin on Monday to give a new push to European efforts to tackle the biggest migrant crisis in 50 years.
The pair will also hold talks on the resurgence of violence in Ukraine and will be joined by that country's president Petro Poroshenko later in the day.
A joint press conference by the trio will be followed by a working dinner.
Merkel and Hollande have put enormous political onus on resolving Ukraine's 16-month pro-Russian uprising and returning peace to the European Union's turbulent eastern front.
Monday's talks will be notable for their exclusion of Russian leader Vladimir Putin.
The French and German leaders had spent 17 hours locked up with Putin and Ukraine's Poroshenko in the Belarusian capital Minsk in February before emerging with a peace deal that promised to end the fighting quickly and resolve all political disputes by the end of the year.
Yet the so-called Minsk II accord has repeatedly been broken by the warring sides. The death toll in the war is meanwhile steadily approaching 6,900.
A Ukrainian source said Putin's exclusion pointed to the fact that ""France and Germany are in the same boat as us"", but a French source quickly quashed any interpretation of a ""diplomatic war against Russia"".
The diplomatic push on migrants meanwhile comes as the EU is grappling with an unprecedented influx of people fleeing war, repression and poverty in what the bloc has described as its worst refugee crisis since World War II.
Official figures show a record 107,500 migrants crossed into the EU last month and there are mounting calls for the bloc to adopt a more unified approach in dealing with the influx.
'New impetus on migrants needed'
""There has to be a new impetus so that what has been decided is implemented,"" a source in the French presidency said, referring to EU decisions taken in June to tackle the crisis.
""The situation is not resolving itself,"" the source said, adding that the decisions made by the EU ""are not sufficient, not quick enough and not up to the task"".
Their priorities include compiling a list of countries whose nationals would not be considered asylum seekers except in exceptional personal circumstances.
The EU has hitherto failed in efforts to draw up a common list of such countries.
The French and German leaders will also move to help speed up the setting up of reception centres in overwhelmed Greece and Italy - two countries that have borne the brunt of the crisis - to help identify asylum seekers and illegal migrants.
""As long as these reception centres are not there and there is no internal solidarity within the EU, the return of migrants - which will dissuade further new arrivals - will not happen,"" the source added.
In Rome, Italian officials said the coastguard had rescued 4,400 migrants from 22 boats in the Mediterranean on Saturday alone in what was understood to be the highest daily figure in years.
Italian Foreign Minister Paolo Gentiloni has warned that the deepening crisis could pose a major threat to the ""soul"" of Europe.
""On immigration, Europe is in danger of displaying the worst of itself: selfishness, haphazard decision-making and rows between member states,"" Gentiloni told Il Messaggero.
German Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel meanwhile said that a four-fold increase in asylum requests - expected to top 800,000 this year - was the country's ""biggest challenge since reunification"" in 1990."

					08:54 CEST+02:00				",AFP/DPA/The Local,Germany to lock out 'cheating' EU migrants,"UPDATE: Germany on Wednesday announced new measures to stop EU citizens from abusing its social welfare system, reacting to what some politicians have labelled ""poverty migration"".
P { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservative Bavarian allies the CSU especially have demanded that EU benefit cheats be expelled, using the slogan ""those who lie, fly"". Under the draft bill agreed by cabinet, EU citizens who fraudulently receive social benefits will be sent home and temporarily prohibited from re-entering Germany. Citizens of other EU countries in Germany would also be expected to find work within six months of arriving, under the bill that must still be passed by parliament. Foreign applicants for child benefits will meanwhile be given tax ID numbers to stop fraud, such as families drawing multiple allowances for a child. Conservative Interior Minister Thomas de Maizière insisted Germany, Europe's largest economy, was not limiting the free movement of people within the EU, a core principle of the 28-nation union. Germany opened its labour market at the start of this year to citizens of Bulgaria and Romania, which both joined the EU in 2007. The arrivals from the Balkan countries have sparked negative newspaper headlines as they have been concentrated in certain cities, including Berlin, Frankfurt, Munich and Duisburg, where migrant families often live in poor conditions. Under the plan announced Wednesday, the government would also spend more than €200 million over a number of years to help towns and cities which have attracted unusually large numbers of EU migrants with housing and other expenses. SEE ALSO: Thousands leave Germany for Bulgaria and Romania Labour and Social Affairs Minister Andrea Nahles, a Social Democrat, stressed that many of the newcomers from eastern EU countries are skilled workers, often doctors attracted by better income prospects in Germany. The total number of Bulgarians and Romanians living in Germany has risen from 35,000 in 2004 to 181,000 in 2012, but de Maiziere and Nahles both said the phenomenon of ""poverty migration"" was not widespread. The new measures have been labelled populist by some critics, and Greens party lawmaker Wolfgang Strengmann-Kuhn told national news agency DPA that ""the government should stop fighting problems that do not exist"".
Boost in benefits As well as the tightening of rules dealing with migrants, the government will introduce a new bill to increase benefits for asylum seekers to subsistence levels. The move follows a decision by the Constitutional Court last year that the government was not doing enough to take care of people fleeing persecution. It will be the first increase in support for asylum seekers since a law setting out how asylum seekers should be treated was passed 19 years ago. People who have been in Germany for more than 18 months and who are unable to return to their home countries will be transferred into the general social security system. They will receive benefits equal to the normal levels of social help after 15 months, rather than waiting four years as was previously the case. This will have a knock-on effect of taking the burden off the towns where asylum seekers live. The government also hopes to take measures to improve healthcare for asylum seekers in a future bill.

					15:44 CEST+02:00				",AFP,Merkel backs Libyan coastguard but warns against abuses,"German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Sunday said the Libyan coastguard should be supported in its efforts to stem the flow of migrants to Europe, but warned that rights abuses would not be tolerated.
A day before a Paris summit on the migrant crisis, Merkel said the Libyan coastguard had to become capable of patrolling its waters and should be given ""the necessary equipment to do its job"".
""At the same time, of course we also consider it of the utmost importance that the Libyan coastguard adheres to international law, both in its dealings with refugees and migrants as well as non-governmental groups,"" she told the Welt am Sonntag newspaper.
""Should any doubts be raised about this, then we will investigate the allegations,"" she vowed.
The Libyan government sparked controversy this month when it barred foreign vessels from a stretch of water off its coast, claiming that charity boats active in the search and rescue zone were facilitating illegal migration.
The move was welcomed by Italy, the main port of arrival for migrants from north Africa, but several NGOs have since suspended their sea missions, accusing the Libyan coastguard of making threats and creating a hostile environment in the Mediterranean.
So far this year more than 100,000 people have made the perilous journey from Libya, according to the International Organization for Migration, and the European Union is eager for Libya to clamp down on the influx.
Over 2,300 have died attempting the crossing.
""We cannot allow the business of people smugglers who have the deaths of so many on their conscience,"" said Merkel.
French President Emmanuel Macron is hosting talks on the crisis at the Elysee Palace on Monday, with Merkel and her Spanish and Italian counterparts in attendance.
Libya's unity government chief Fayez al-Sarraj and the leaders of Chad and Niger will also attend the gathering.
Merkel, who is campaigning for a fourth term in next month's general election, told Die Welt am Sonntag that she had no regrets about her bold move to open Germany's borders to refugees in 2015.
""I would make all the important decisions of 2015 again in the same way,"" she said.
The arrival of hundreds of thousands of asylum seekers, mainly from Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan, deeply divided Germany and hurt Merkel's approval ratings.
But as the influx has slowed in recent months, Merkel's popularity has rebounded and her conservatives are comfortably leading in the polls ahead of the September 24th vote.

					09:03 CEST+02:00				",AFP,France and Germany seek new migration solutions as rescue ships left adrift,"Germany and France pushed Sunday for new solutions to the migration crisis as bickering among European Union leaders left boats carrying hundreds of African migrants adrift at sea.
Sixteen of the EU's 28 leaders held emergency talks in Brussels to find a way forward despite a longstanding deadlock over who should take in migrants and refugees who land in Italy and other European countries.
Hundreds of people fleeing conflict and persecution at home are caught in the midst of a worsening row over how to deal with the influx against a backdrop of mass drownings in the Mediterranean in recent years.
Italy, a country on the frontline of the crisis, has turned away rescue vessels, with its new populist government demanding greater solidarity from reluctant fellow EU states.
One boat, the Lifeline, remained in limbo on Sunday with 239 Africans aboard, including pregnant women and children, with Malta and Italy refusing to take it in, after the Aquarius suffered a similar fate until it was allowed to dock in Spain.

Italy's far-right Interior Minister Matteo Salvini bluntly told foreign charities on Sunday to stop rescuing migrants off Libya, where one group said 1,000 people were on boats in distress.
He accused them of abetting people smugglers.
But the German operators of the Lifeline hit out at Salvini for referring to its passengers as a consignment of ""human flesh"".
""Dear Matteo Salvini, we have no meat on board, but humans,"" it said in a statement.
The plight of the stranded migrants lent a sense of urgency to the meeting in Brussels, which was riven with divisions and snubbed by countries taking a hardline on the issue.
French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel vowed to forge ahead with like-minded leaders on ways to reduce migrant flows and share responsibility for those who land on Europe's shores.
Merkel, who is scrambling to prevent a mutiny in her government over migration, admitted there were still ""some differences"" but also ""a great deal of common ground"".
Limited deals
Macron pointed to the sharp drop in Mediterranean crossings since 2015 as proof that the crisis is now mainly ""political"", fuelled by the rise of anti-immigration populists.
Italy has accused him of ""arrogance"" and placed the responsibility for saving migrants in the Mediterranean squarely at the feet of Libya, much of which is lawless.
Officials warn that a new surge of migrants could trigger the collapse of free travel within the EU, its signature achievement.
""Our top priority, if we want to save free movement within the Schengen area, is to ensure real, strict controls of the EU's external borders,"" Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel said.

Sunday's meeting paves the way for a full EU summit on Thursday and Friday.
Merkel however downplayed the likelihood of ""an overall solution to the migration problem"", suggesting ""bilateral or trilateral agreements for mutual benefit"" instead.
Macron urged a European solution, ""whether that is cooperation among 28 or among several countries that decide to move forward together"".
Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovakia, which have refused to take in refugees from overstretched countries such as Italy and Greece, boycotted the Brussels meeting.
Macron has infuriated Italy by accusing it of ""irresponsibility"" for turning away migrant vessels and denouncing the ""leprosy"" of rising populism.
Italy has in turn accused France of hypocrisy, noting that Paris keeps pushing migrants back across their shared border.
Under the EU's so-called Dublin rules, asylum-seekers must be processed in the country where they first arrive, usually Italy, Greece and Spain.
EU leaders last December had set the end of June as a deadline to establish a permanent mechanism to distribute asylum-seekers throughout the bloc -- but an agreement has proved elusive.
Europe's 'refugee camp'
France and Spain have called for asylum-seekers to be kept in closed centres until their claims are processed -- a proposal that Rome fears would turn Italy into ""a refugee camp for all of Europe"".
The issue has raised tensions in Germany, where Merkel is trying to placate a coalition ally opposed to taking in more migrants.
Her hardline Interior Minister Horst Seehofer has given her until the end of June to find a European deal to curb new arrivals.
If that fails, he has vowed to order border police to turn back migrants, which means many will likely have to return to Italy.

In a counter-proposal, Italy on Sunday called for migrant ""protection centres"" to be set up in several EU countries to relieve overcrowding in its facilities and also demanded more aid for African countries that fight human trafficking.
EU leaders also discussed measures to strengthen the external borders -- an issue on which there is consensus -- and roposals for centres in countries outside the bloc to separate genuine war refugees from economic migrants.
Cooperation deals with Turkey and Libya have sharply cut the flow of migrants to Europe since a 2015 peak of over one million.

					16:00 CET+01:00				", The Local,Germany blasts countries that won't take back migrants,"The German government has sent angry letters to the 17 countries most reluctant to take back their nationals who’ve had asylum applications rejected in Germany.
The letters were mostly sent to capitals in North and West Africa and in the Indian sub-continent, national daily Die Welt reveals.
Berlin is desperately trying to find solutions to deport the hundreds of thousands of migrants who have had their asylum applications rejected.
Last year only 21,000 of the 200,000 asylum seekers whose applications were rejected left the country, meaning 179,000 remain in Germany as so-called ‘tolerated’ people.
With hundreds of thousands of refugees who entered the Federal Republic during the course of the year still to have their applications decided on, this number is set to swell yet further.
The most common reason why Germany cannot deport people is that as many as 70 percent of asylum seekers arrive in the country without official documentation, making it extremely difficult for the government to find out where they are originally from.
Berlin has even been accused of paying other countries to recognize people as their citizens, resulting in people being deported to countries they have no attachment to.
But even if Germany does know where a migrant originally comes from, the problem of returning them home often does not end there.
States like Pakistan, Algeria and Tunisia refuse to cooperate with German authorities, despite being obliged by international law to comply.
Tiny number sent back
Pakistan is particularly problematic. In 2014 there were only two deportations to that country despite 580 people having their applications rejected. In 2013, 533 Pakistanis had their asylum applications rejected but only three of them were sent home.
Local authorities often didn’t chase up German inquiries about migrants’ identities because they involve long journeys into distant parts of the country, Die Welt writes.
North Africa is another problem region.
Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere is travelling to the region at the end of the week to try and convince governments there to start taking more migrants back.
MUST READ: Germany orders one-year-old girl to leave within a week
With North Africans the problem is particularly urgent because migrants from there have often been associated with crime.
In Saxony, where the majority of Tunisian migrants are sent, authorities have reported that while Tunisians make up 4 percent of the migrant population, they are found guilty of a quarter of crimes committed by migrants.
Tunisians almost never have their asylum applications granted - only 0.2 percent are successful. Nonetheless, of the 678 Tunisians told they wouldn’t be allowed to stay in Germany, only 66 have were deported in 2015.
Meanwhile the majority of asylum seekers from Morocco and Algeria have until recently been sent to North Rhine-Westphalia. Current investigations into robberies and sexual assaults during New Year's Eve show that most of the suspects for these crimes came from these two countries.
Carrot and stick approach
Die Welt reports that there are several of factors at play for why countries are so reluctant to take their citizens back.
For some it means the tiresome bureaucracy involved in tracking down their identity papers in chaotic state registers to verify who they are.
The illegal migrants are often also a boon for these developing countries if they stay abroad - as when they start to earn money in Euros they send part of it back to their families and feed into the local economy.
Thirdly, some states are reluctant to take back citizens who in some cases are associated with criminality and would be potential troublemakers back home.
Germany meanwhile is trying to create movement on the issue through a mixture of threats and bribes.
While vice-Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel has raised the possibility of development aid being withdrawn from serial refuseniks, the government has also told several African countries that if they started taking back migrants a ""new phase"" of relations will start ""which will have positive effects on our future cooperation."""

					13:38 CEST+02:00				",DPA/The Local,'Women are being attacked every day': violence at small town festival reignites migration debate,"Reports of sexual assaults and attacks on police during a small town festival have again sparked debate in Germany about integration, while also leading police to correct what they say are ""misinterpretations"" of what happened.
The news that around 1,000 young people gathered on Saturday night during a festival in Schorndorf, Baden-Württemberg where some began throwing bottles at officers has grabbed national attention in Germany, particularly because police said many came from “immigrant backgrounds”.
This coupled with the fact that cases of sexual assaults or harassment were reported by women on Friday and Saturday, with Iraqi and Afghanistani men being investigated, has further added fuel to the fire.
Jens Spahn, a member of Chancellor Angela Merkel’s conservative CDU party in the Bundestag (German parliament), said that the events during the fest reflected Germany’s problem with integration of immigrants.
“Schorndorf is a symbol of what is happening on a daily basis in many places in Germany,” Spahn told Die Welt on Wednesday.
“It is becoming ever more clear how big the task of integration is.”
Spahn, who is openly gay, added that German society runs the risk of becoming more anti-Semitic, homophobic, macho, and violent. Claiming that regional newspapers report every day on attacks against women, he called for a greater debate.
“We must face up to this. Too many people are of the opinion that every other culture is an enrichment. I do not feel that the everyday debasement that women experience is an enrichment.”
Ralf Stegner of the centre-left SPD fired back on Twitter, writing that “not all input” from the conservative CDU/CSU parties is enriching either. He also tweeted that the fact that the far-right AfD party had praised Spahn meant there was “no further comment necessary”.
Die Äußerungen von @jensspahn werden von den Rechtspopulisten um Herrn Gauland ausdrücklich gelobt.
Kommentar erübrigt sich.
— Ralf Stegner (@Ralf_Stegner) July 19, 2017
Local police on Wednesday, meanwhile, sought to correct what they called “misinterpretations” of their original report on the Schorndorf fest, emphasizing in a new report that the vast majority of the 1,000 people who they said had gathered on Saturday in the grounds of Schorndorf Castle were not involved in the crimes reported.
In fact, police said that just around 100 teens and young adults there were deemed to have “high potential for violence” and that bottles thrown at police officers came from within this smaller crowd.
At one point, a German 16-year-old threw a bottle that ended up hitting a 19-year-old Syrian in the head, leading him to be treated by emergency medical services. Police then doubled the number of officers in the area.
Then a 20-year-old German was detained over assaulting another member of this crowd. Police say this young man put up great resistance to officers trying to detain him, leading the group of about 100 people to rally behind him and try to fight back against officers. Police observed that most of the people in this group had an immigrant background.
Police then threatened the crowd with pepper spray and batons. More bottles were then thrown at officers, hitting many of them, though not injuring them because of their protective gear.
Six police cars were also damaged by graffiti, bottles and scratches.
'Not a second Cologne'
In total, 53 crimes were recorded by police over the course of the five-day festival, of which 28 were committed between Saturday night and early Sunday morning. This was nearly twice the number of crimes reported last year in total: 28.
Nine sex crimes were reported, three of which could not be corroborated. Police and public prosecutors are currently investigating four cases involving unknown suspects, as well as another two known suspects for sexual harassment. No arrests warrants have yet been issued in these cases.
In one of the cases, a 25-year-old woman reported that on Friday night, a man had grabbed her multiple times on her backside. A 20-year-old Iraqi refugee was questioned as a potential suspect, but police subsequently let him go.
In another case, a 17-year-old Austrian girl told police that in the early hours of Sunday, she was held against her will and grabbed on her backside by someone. Police suspected one of three Afghan teens between the ages of 17 and 18 to be the culprit, but authorities could not corroborate the initial report of the girl being held against her will.
While police said in their new report that the reports of sexual harassment were unusual for the town festival, officials have also denounced comparisons by the AfD party to the mass sexual assaults reportedly committed largely by men of North African or Middle Eastern appearance on New Year’s Eve 2015-16 in cities like Cologne.
“This is not a second Cologne, and it’s not a second Hamburg,” mayor Matthias Klopfer told public broadcasters ARD and ZDF on Tuesday, referencing the violent riots in Hamburg amid mainly left-wing protests during the G20 summit there earlier this month."
