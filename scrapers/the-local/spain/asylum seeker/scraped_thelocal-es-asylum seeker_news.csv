The immigrants claim that they fled the Gdeim Izik refugee camp in the territory of Western Sahara, a former Spanish colony annexed by Morocco in 1975, after it was forcibly dismantled by the Moroccan police, according to a Council of Europe press release. They arrived on makeshift boats on the coast of Spain's Canary Islands in 2011 and lodged applications for international protection. These were rejected after being considered twice by the Spanish Minister of the Interior who ordered their deportation. Seeking a stay of execution for their deportation orders, they applied in January 2011 for a judicial review and Spain's National Court ordered a provisional suspension of the procedure for their removal. This would allow the court to thoroughly examine their allegations about the risks they would face if they were returned to Morocco. But the following day, the court rejected the asylum seekers' application for a stay of execution. The asylum seekers then turned to the European Court of Human Rights (EHCR). They claimed that they had been subjected to ill-treatment by the Moroccan authorities because of their Sahrawi origin and that they would feel threatened in the event of their return.
The immigrants alleged they had been physically assaulted and that some of their family members had been sexually assaulted or tortured by police officers. In the findings of the hearing, the court noted that the asylum-seekers' fears ""did not seem irrational"" and noted that ""because of the expedited nature of the proceedings, the applicants had not had the opportunity to provide any further explanations on these points"". The EHCR found unanimously that there had been a violation of Article 13 (right to an effective remedy) and Articles 2 (right to life) and 3 (prohibition of inhuman or degrading treatment). The court held that Spain ""was to ensure that the applicants remained within its territory while their cases were being examined, pending a final decision by the domestic authorities on their applications for international protection"".

The Dublin Regulation is designed to stop people applying for asylum in multiple European Union member states. Under the system, the country where asylum applicants first arrive in the European Union is responsible for processing their applications.

					14:07 CEST+02:00				",Fiona Govan,EU tells Spain to take in more asylum seekers,"Spain will have to accept more asylum seekers under controversial quotas issued by the European Commission after its complaints over the plan were ignored.
The EU's executive body dismissed a plea by Spain's foreign minister that Spain's own economic situation and battle to control illegal immigration at its own borders should be further taken into account when determining the quotas.
The quotas were announced by the European Commission in its European Agenda on Migration on Wednesday and will become mandatory once voted in by the Council of Ministers.
Spain will be required to take 4,288 of the 40,000 asylum seekers in Italy and Greece destined to be relocated across EU member-states. The figure represents 10.72 percent of the total, a far cry below Germany at 21.91 percent and France at 16.88 percent.
Spain will also be expected to take in a further 1,549 people over the next two years under the voluntary scheme to settle 20,000 people fleeing conflict who are currently residing outside the EU.
The quota per country is based on a redistribution key that gives population size a weight of 40 percent, with a further 40 percent based on economic growth, 10 percent on unemployment and 10 percent on former engagement with asylum seekers.
But Spain had argued that both unemployment and immigration record be given more weight in the calculation.
Ahead of the proposals, Spain's foreign minister José Manuel Garcia-Margallo had asked that the fixed quota would reflect Spain's high unemployment rate (which stands at 24 percent) as well as the nation's previous efforts to absorb asylum seekers.
""Pledging to take in migrants to whom you cannot provide work would be, in my opinion, providing a bad service,"" he argued at a meeting in Brussels earlier this month.
The plan took no account of the ""huge effort we are making to control migration from Morocco, Mauritania and Senegal which impacts the whole EU"", Margallo added.
The new measure is intended to apply to the 24,000 Syrians and Eritreans who arrived in Italy after April 15th and are deemed to be in need of protection. A further 16,000 migrants who arrived in Greece from the two countries should also be relocated, the EU said.
The European Commission said the chosen number represents approximately 40 percent of asylum seekers in clear need of protection who arrived in Italy and Greece last year.
More than 1,800 migrants have died in the Mediterranean in 2015 - a 20-fold increase on the same period in 2014.
Some 60,000 people have already tried to make the perilous crossing this year, the UN estimates.
The European Agenda on Migration also includes proposals to beef up European border controls, including a military action plan to stop people smugglers and improving ways for qualified immigrant workers to get jobs.
The idea is backed by countries including Sweden, Germany, Austria and Italy, but faces strong opposition from, among others, Hungary and the UK.
The latter has already indicated it would use its legal right to opt out of the scheme so it has not been designated a quota.
Countries which agree to take in the Syrians and Eritreans will be offered €6,000 per person, with the greatest number to be moved to Germany."

Police reported on Wednesday that they had arrested 15 people connected to a criminal organization that brought immigrants into the UK by going through airports in Spain's Canary Islands.
The report said that in December, an Iranian man had been arrested at Tenerife's airport while trying to fly to London with a fake passport and ID card.
This case led police to discover that a criminal organization had been helping Iranian and Albanian immigrants illegally enter the UK, and in particular London, through the Canary Islands in order to later apply for political asylum.
According to police, the gang demanded that immigrants pay large quantities of money to get to their final destinations, normally during high tourist seasons.
Once in the UK, the immigrants would apply for political asylum.
The group acted as ""facilitators"" for the immigrants, saying they were from Iran and guiding small groups of two or three people at a time. They would accompany the travelers to border control and would offer to act as translators if they ran into trouble with authorities.
The 15 suspects were arrested at the Gran Canaria and Tenerife Sur airports, two of whom for being members of the criminal organization.
Police seized a number of documents from the group, including fake Polish and Bulgarian passports, a stolen Israeli passport, Italian ID cards, two authentic Bulgarian passports and two other stolen British passports.
The investigation remains open and is being conducted in collaboration with UK police."

""In Europe everyone must uphold the commonly agreed standards, in the way we receive asylum seekers,"" said Migration and Home Affairs Commissioner Dimitris Avramopoulos in a statement.
""These standards need to be fully implemented and respected, while always respecting the dignity and human rights of the applicants.""
The investigation comes as EU leaders are meeting on Wednesday for an emergency summit about the ongoing refugee crisis across the continent, where they will be discussing border security, aid resources and a plan to redistribute 120,000 refugees among member states.
Denmark, Ireland and the United Kingdom will not face an investigation because they do not take part in EU asylum legislation.

					08:51 CEST+02:00				",AFP,Spain must allow asylum requests at border: EU,"The EU urged Spain on Thursday to allow migrants trying to enter its north African enclaves to present their asylum requests without having to scale border fences.
The appeal from the European Commission, the executive of the 28-nation EU, implicitly urged the Spanish police not to immediately deport the migrants who arrive at the enclaves of Ceuta and Melilla.
Commission spokeswoman Nathalie Bertaud told reporters EU commissioner for migration, Dimitris Avramopoulos, would visit Spain Monday and Tuesday ""to take stock of the situation on the ground"" in light of a new law authorising such deportations.
""The recent establishment of offices at the border for requests for international protection in Ceuta and Melilla is seen by the Commission as a positive development,"" she said.
""However, it is necessary to ensure that the border crossing point is accessible in practice to allow asylum seekers to present their application, without having to scale the border fences,"" Bertaud added.
Bertaud said Avramopoulos would meet Monday in the capital Madrid with Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy following an invitation to the country by Interior Minister Fernandez Diaz.
""The Commission has closely followed the legislative developments concerning the establishment of a special regime for Ceuta and Melilla,"" she added.
""We will continue to monitor the practices implementing this new legislation.""
The law passed by the lower house of the parliament on March 26 authorises the police to immediately deport migrants who arrive at Ceuta and Melilla, which have Europe's only two land borders with Africa.
The deportations have been sharply criticized by the Council of Europe and several human rights associations.
""The Commission recalls that any border surveillance measure must be proportionate to the objectives pursued, and it must be in compliance with the respect of fundamental rights and the principle of non-refoulement,"" she said.
Spain faces growing pressure from migrants coming from Africa, particularly through its two enclaves there. According to the authorities, more than 16,000 people tried to enter them in 2014 and nearly 5,000 succeeded, compared so some 3,000 in 2013."

					10:46 CET+01:00				", The Local,Spain to put asylum offices on African border,"In an apparent change of tune on immigration, the government has announced that it will make it easier for refugees to ask for asylum in Spain's North African enclaves.
The Interior Ministry announced on Wednesday that it will create ""centres of attention for asylum seekers"" at border posts in the enclaves of Ceuta and Melilla, the two North African cities where there have been a series of violent incidents in recent months between security forces and migrants as the latter attempt to cross the high fences built to stop illegal immigration. In an apparent softening of its anti-immigration stance, the conservative Popular Party government has decided to carry out this particular recommendation made by the UN’s Refugee Agency (UNHCR) just weeks after announcing that it planned to change Spanish law to allow for instant expulsions at the border, the eldiario.es news site reported. All opposition groups in Congress criticised the plan to insert a clause into the Citizen Security Law which would enable the security forces to escort immigrants who had scaled the triple fence complex back to Moroccan territory, defining such actions as “rejection at the border”. Human rights organisations have distributed films of this practice taking place, in breach of current Spanish rules as well as international law. The video of one sub-Saharan migrant being beaten until he apparently fell unconscious before he was dragged to the Moroccan side of the fence at Melilla sparked criticism of Spain from the European Commission and the United Nations, among others. The Interior Ministry said that the plan to build special asylum posts, to be put into action in the coming months, “will strengthen the system of international protection and meet more fully the requirements of the Common European Asylum System”. Anyone reaching such an office and requesting asylum would then be housed at the respective enclave’s temporary immigrant shelter or be allowed to seek private accommodation in the territory. As well as sub-Saharan migrants, many Syrians and people of other nationalities fleeing turbulence and conflicts in the Middle East have attempted to enter Spain via Ceuta and Melilla. Spain’s leading association in the defence of immigrants’ rights, the Refugees Assistance Commission (CEAR), gave the new measure a cautious welcome. Estrella Galán, CEAR president, said she was still concerned for the welfare of the thousands of sub-Saharan migrants who camp out in the forests beyond the border and who face harassment from Moroccan police. ""We are concerned that access to these [asylum] units is not guaranteed, particularly in the case of sub-Saharans, for whom it would be almost impossible to reach the border posts at Ceuta and Melilla. If the Moroccan Gendarmerie is going to prevent sub-Saharans’ arrivals, the solution will only be a relative one,” Galán said. If the migrant’s asylum request were to be rejected, they would be returned to the country of origin, namely Morocco in this case. Last year Spain received 4,502 asylum requests, of which 22 percent were formally accepted for consideration. The proportion finally granted tends to be even lower."

The data on asylum protection grants was published a day before the European Commission presented its migration action plan on Wednesday. In response to the influx of migrants seeking to reach the continent, the plan includes beefed-up European border protections and quotas for the number of migrants each country should take in, seen as a way to share the responsibility fairly.
""The plight of thousands of migrants putting their lives in peril to cross the Mediterranean has shocked.
""It is clear that no EU country can or should be left alone to address huge migratory pressures,"" the Commission wrote in its report.
The total of 1,600 people granted asylum last year in Spain was less than half of the 3,620 asylum cases that had been decided as of the latest analysis.
Forty-four percent of people were granted protection on their first asylum application attempt while only 15 percent of appeal cases received positive outcomes.
Still, Spain's acceptance rate was not far behind the European Union average. Of the 358,365 cases that had been decided across the EU, about 185,000 people - or slightly more than half - were granted protection status. Forty-five percent of asylum seekers received protection in their first attempt on average in the EU, while 18 percent had positive outcomes in their appeal cases.
The majority of those granted asylum by Spain came from Syria (72.7 percent) followed by the second largest group from Somalia (5.7 percent) and the third largest group from Palestine (5.4 percent).
Germany accepted the greatest share of asylum seekers - more than 47,000 people as of the latest analysis and a quarter of the EU total, though its acceptance rate was similar to Spain's at less than 50 percent.
The Commission plan on Wednesday came amid concerns at the growing numbers of refugees, especially from war-torn countries like Syria, after weeks in which hundreds have died attempting to cross the Mediterranean Sea by boat to reach the continent.
Other proposals within the plan include better targeting of people smugglers, whose unsafe and over-crowded boats have been blamed for recent tragedies, and expanding resources for search and rescue.
It also calls for better methods for identifying migrants, improving ways for qualified immigrant workers to get jobs, and monitoring those whose applications are rejected to ensure they make it home.
Even more ambitious are proposals for finding ways to solve the problems that cause people to flee in the first place. The Commission calls for building ""stronger partnerships with key countries outside the EU""."

Spain spent €289,394,768.35 ($394,346,674.56) on border protection from 2007 to 2013. During the same period, however, it spent just €9,342,834.50 ($12,731,100) on programmes to benefit refugees and asylum seekers. These are the figures cited in a new Amnesty International report on immigration into the EU. The difference between the Spanish two figures was also the largest in the EU, Amnesty International said in its report titled The human cost of Fortress Europe: Human rights violations against migrants and refugees at Europe’s borders. Europe-wide, the spend was nearly €2 billion on border protection and €700 million on improving the situation for would-be immigrants. ""The effectiveness of EU measures to stem the flow of irregular migrants and refugees is, at best, questionable. Meanwhile, the cost in human lives and misery is incalculable and is being paid by some of the world’s most vulnerable people,” said John Dalhuisen, Europe and Central Asia Programme Director at Amnesty International. In June, the EU told Spain — the only EU country with land borders with Africa — it would receive €10 million ($13.6 million) from the European Union to fight illegal immigration in its two north African territories of Ceuta and Melilla. The money would come from the EU's emergency fund and it would be used on ""some of the 26 projects proposed by Spain to face the situation in Ceuta and Melilla"", the EU said in a statement. Part of the funds will be used to strengthen border fences, fund voluntary return programmes for migrants who manage to enter the two territories illegally and make improvements to government-run migrant reception centres. In late May, about 500 African migrants leapt a towering, triple-layer border fence to cross from Morocco into Melilla. A reception centre in Melilla is built to house 480 immigrants but now houses over 2,000 people. Aside from trying to storm the border fence around Melilla, would-be immigrants also try to sail or swim to Melilla and Ceuta which sit on the Mediterranean opposite mainland Spain. On February 6th about 15 migrants drowned in Moroccan waters while trying to swim to Ceuta from a nearby beach. Spain's interior minister on March 4th estimated there were 40,000 migrants waiting to cross from Morocco into Ceuta and Melilla. Another 40,000 were waiting to enter Morocco from Mauritania en route to the two cities, he added.
The Amnesty International report also comes a day after another human rights group called for the closure of Spain's refugee internment camps. ""We want international observers in Melilla, because of a constant and daily violation of human rights,"" said Christian Orgaz of the State Campaign for the Closure of Internment camps (CIE). The group said both Spanish and Moroccan authorities were responsible for these violations which included police violence, a lack of healthcare provision for migrants and the ""absolute abondomment"" of migrants under the age of 18 in the city of Melilla."

The secretary of the bishops' commission on migration has joined hands with several other Catholic organizations including the charity Caritas to denounce the proposed change. The Spanish government in October announced that it would include a legal amendment in its planned new Citizen Security Law authorizing police to expel migrants who climb the fence around Melilla and Ceuta, without giving their asylum claims a hearing — a move slammed by opposition parties. But the Catholic groups on Monday expressed their ""energetic rejection"" of the plan saying in a statement that any such changes would effectively make borders ""a human rights-free zone"". They said the new law would only increase people's suffering and would not provide solutions for the people ""who abandoned their countries of origin, to, after an arduous journey, arrival at the borders of Ceuta and Melilla"".

In 2013, around 4,200 people entered the enclaves illegally by land and sea, he said.

Individuals may apply for Spanish citizenship after ten years of residency, but refugees must only wait for five years and those coming from countries that once belonged to the former Spanish Empire need only wait for two.

""We demand this minimum amount of dignity -- that at least this number of refugees (16,000) can come,"" he said. ""In Catalonia, everything is ready to welcome them.""
The protest, organised by a group calling itself Castra Nostra Casa Vostra (Our home is your home), finished at the Mediterranean coast -- a symbolic location given the more than 5,000 migrants who lost their lives trying to cross the sea last year.

					13:41 CET+01:00				", The Local,Desperate migrants storm fences in Melilla,"UPDATED: Some 250 asylum seekers stormed the barbed wire border fences between Morocco and the Spanish enclave of Melilla on Monday morning with around 150 managing to enter the city, officials said.
The would-be migrants charged the high fences at 6am, Spain's El País newspaper reported. Once in the city, the men from Sub-Saharan Africa separated into smaller groups, ""presumably"" heading for the CETI refugee transit centre, the national daily said. Some chanted ""Barça! Barça"" as they ran through the city streets. The 'assault' on the border between the Spanish city of Melilla and Morocco comes soon after at least 14 migrants drowned trying to swim to the Spanish enclave of Ceuta from a beach in neighbouring Morocco. The tragedy took place after Moroccan security forces and Spain’s Civil Guard Police repelled the entry of up to 400 sub-Saharan immigrants, Spanish daily 20minutos reported. Spanish authorities initially denied shooting rubber bullets at the migrants in the water, but later admitted they had done so. They stressed, however, that no one had been injured by the projectiles.
The EU is now calling for Spain to explain why rubber bullets were used with the EU Commissioner for Home Affairs, Cecilia Malmstrom, saying she was ""very concerned"". Melilla and Ceuta have Europe's only land borders with Africa. Spanish authorities say some 30,000 would-be migrants are currently based in Morocco in the hope of entering Europe illegally. Most of these people hope to enter via Melilla and Ceuta, El País reported police sources as saying. The issue of clandestine migration from Africa to Europe has been in the spotlight since at least 232 asylum seekers died when their boat caught fire and sunk off the coast of the Italian island of Lampedusa."

					12:38 CET+01:00				", The Local,Seven reasons why Spain is failing on human rights,"From police brutality, failure to meet refugee relocation quotas, and eroding the right to freedom speech, Spain still has a long way to go on human rights, according to a report by Amnesty International.
The campaign organization released on Wednesday its annual human rights report for 2016-17, delivering the most comprehensive analysis of the state of human rights in 159 countries around the world.
These are the seven areas of concern identified in Spain.
1. Freedom of expression and assembly
Spaniards have been protesting as the country's new ""gag law"" comes into force. Photo: Dani Pozo/AFP
Throughout 2016, the repressive “gag law” was used to place “unwarranted restrictions on the rights to freedom of expression, information and public assembly” according to the report..
It was a year that saw two puppeteers imprisoned for five days for performing a street play which included the sign “Up with Eta” in reference to the Basque separatist terrorist group. They were investigated for “glorifying terrorism and incitement to hatred” but the charges were later dropped.
2. Torture and other ill-treatment
New cases of torture and other ill-treatment, including excessive use of force by law enforcement officers, were reported throughout the year, stated the report.
The report highlighted the case of Ester Quintana, the protestor who lost an eye after being hit with a rubber bullet by the regional Mossos d’Esquadra police force during a demonstration in Barcelona. The trial, which took place last May, ended with the acquittal of the officers involved as the court was unable to establish which one had fired the bullet.
3. Refugees’ and migrants’ rights

Spain was slammed for the inadequate reception system for asylum-seekers, with too few places at reception centres and not enough assistance for those housed outside them. Spain was also criticised for its failure to implement the Asylum Act, six years after its entry into force and the enormous backlog of asylum applications – registered at 29,845 cases by August.
The report also slammed authorities for the collective expulsion of migrants who climbed the border fences from Morocco into the enclaves of Melilla and Ceuta and allowed them to be beaten by Moroccan officers who entered into the territory between the fences.
READ MORE: Refugees welcome in Spain. So where are they?
Despite Spain pledging to take in 1,449 refugees from the Middle East and North Africa, Spain only accepted 289 individuals – all Syrian refugees - by the end of December.
Likewise, only 363 refugees were resettled to Spain from overcrowded camps in Italy and Greece by December, a far cry from the commitment to take in 15,888 people.
4. Impunity
Archive photo from the Spanish Civil War: AFP
Spain was criticised for failing to investigate crimes carried out during the Civil War and subsequent dictatorship of Francisco Franco.
It was noted that Spain is continuing to refuse to cooperate with the Argentine judiciary to investigate crimes, such as enforced disappearance and torture, under international law.
5. Discrimination – Migrants’ Health
Spain was called out once again for failing to offer protection to some of the most vulnerable social groups. The report blamed austerity measures for restricting health care for undocumented migrants, removing health cards from 748,835 people and potentially putting their lives at risk. It said women had been particularly effected, with barriers placed on access to services related to sexual and reproductive health.
6. Right to housing

Evictions have been a major flashpoint in Spain since the economy crashed in 2008, and the housing crisis continued during 2016 with 19,714 forced mortgage evictions and 25,688 evictions for nonpayment of rent.
“Householders facing repossession claims continued to lack adequate legal remedies to enforce the protection of their right to housing before courts,” said the report.
7. Violence against women

Spain's Ministry of Health reported that 44 women were killed by current or former partners during 2016 – a reduction on the 56 killed in similar circumstances the year before but enough to continue being concerned about “the effectiveness of prosecutions and the adequacy of victim protection measures.”"

Red Cross volunteers who helped the young men found that six of the men had a fever and called regional health authorities for assistance, concerned about possible cases of Ebola. Four hours passed before doctors arrived on the scene, during which time Red Cross workers supplied the Africans with food, water and face masks. When the doctors did show, they cleared the men over Ebola fears. All but four of the men — the most ill — were then taken to a local police station in the back of a rubbish truck.

The recent incident on the beach came amid heightened fears over Ebola in Spain after a Spanish nursing assistant became the first person in Europe to contract the virus while treating two infected Spanish missionaries repatriated from Sierra Leone. SEE ALSO: There is no risk of risk of Ebola spreading in Europe It also comes in the context of intense pressures on Spain's land border with Morocco at its North African enclaves of Melilla, with a sharp rise in the number of would-be migrants trying to cross the triple-layer fence and enter Spanish territory. The Spanish government recently announced it will make it easier for refugees to ask for asylum in Spain's North African enclaves by creating ""centres of attention for asylum seekers"" at border posts. The move came after the government was heavily criticized over plans to change the country's Citizen Security Law to allow for the rejection of migrants at the border — illegal under international law."

					09:11 CET+01:00				",AFP,Western Sahara protest draws thousands,"Several thousand people demonstrated in Madrid on Sunday in support of independence for the disputed territory of Western Sahara, a former Spanish colony in northwestern Africa.
About 3,000 protesters marched from Atocha railway station to the central Plaza de la Provincia behind a banner declaring ""Sahara Free now!"", a photographer with news agency AFP said. Banners from many parts of Spain could be seen at the demonstration which also included live music and street performers dressed in the red, green, black and white of the traditional Saharawi flag. ""We believe the Saharawi people have to right to self-determination,"" said Jose Taboada, president of the Coordination of Spanish Associations of Solidarity with Western Sahara, which organised the protest and wants the territory to vote on independence. ""This is a scream to demand that the Spanish government intervene to help the Saharawis to be able to vote to decide what they would like to be,"" he told AFP. Western Sahara, larger than Britain but with a population under one million people, has lucrative phosphate reserves, rich fishing grounds and, potentially, oil. Morocco took control of most of the territory in November 1975 when colonial power Spain withdrew, prompting a guerrilla war for independence that lasted until 1991 when the United Nations brokered a ceasefire and sent in a peacekeeping mission. The agreement also directed a referendum in a few months' time, under which Saharawis would vote either for independence or to integrate with Morocco, but that vote has yet to take place. Local Saharawi people have long campaigned for the right to self-determination but most Moroccans now view the territory as a part of their kingdom. Morocco wants talks about self-rule for the territory under Moroccan sovereignty, but the territory's Algerian-backed Polisario Front independence movement has demanded a referendum that would include the option of full independence. Several thousand Saharawis live in refugee camps across the border in western Algeria's barren Tindouf province or in Moroccan controlled territory where they complain of repression. The protest was staged to coincide with a European conference for support for the Saharawi people held in Madrid. The conference wrapped up with a resolution by the participants accusing Morocco of preventing the United Nations' envoy for Western Sahara, Christopher Ross, of carrying out his mission. ""The conference renews its support for Christopher Ross and recognizes his determination to carry out his mission,"" the resolution added. Morocco in 2012 said it had lost confidence in Ross, claiming he made ""biased and unbalanced"" decisions concerning the disputed region. ""The Polisario Front and the Saharawi government until now are convinced by the Saharawi public opinion of the need to continue on a peaceful and diplomatic path,"" the head of the Polisario, Mohamed Abdelaziz, told AFP on the sidelines of the conference in Madrid. ""The situation in the region is dangerous, with a real increase in the causes of instability as the situation in Libya, Mali and the Sahel region in general show,"" he added. ""The Saharawi republic and the Polisario Front are necessary forces to protect stability and moderation, to protect the region against a slide towards extremism,"" he added. ""The one who has chosen war and escalation and extremism is, unfortunately, Morocco."" Europe and the United States have expressed concern that the conflict, because it has soured relations between Morocco and Algeria, is preventing the two neighbours from working together to contain Islamist violence in the region."

Officers then contacted the ship to tell them to stop lowering the ramp and found the man hiding within. They were able to get him out and onto land without injury.
A spokesman said the young man had probably been able to climb on board the ship from the water to hide himself inside the ramp mechanism.
Police described the stowaway as a young man from north Africa who was travelling without any identification. After ensuring that the young man was unharmed, officers deported him to Morocco under an agreement between the Spanish and Moroccan governments.
Several high profile cases have grabbed the attention of the Spanish press in recent months, highlighting the plight of migrants trying to reach Europe and the great lengths they are willing to go to.
Last month an eight-year-old boy was discovered hidden in a suitcase at a border crossing at Spain's north African enclave of Ceuta, in an attempt to reunite with his parents in Spain.
Spain's two territories in northern Africa, Ceuta and Melilla, are often where many migrants seek to cross into the country and are Europe's only land border with Africa.
The Spanish Civil Guard has also been criticized in the past for officers' harsh treatment of people trying to hop the border, especially after a video emerged of guards beating a man found climbing the fence into Melilla.
Spain has also complained about EU plans to more evenly distribute asylum seekers across the countries through a quota system, saying Spain already makes great efforts to control African migration. Tens of thousands have attempted to cross the Mediterranean Sea to reach Europe this year and many have died making the perilous journey."

Madrid has ""readmitted 55 people"" who entered Melilla to Morocco, the Spanish central government's representative in the territory said in a statement.
Another 140 migrants have requested asylum, 10 are recovering from their injuries and three are minors, it said.
Spain has become the main entry point for migrants and asylum-seekers looking for a better life in Europe as other EU countries tighten up controls at their borders. A smuggling route through Libya to Italy has also been complicated by conflict and violence there.
One man who took part in the mass storming of the border died shortly after he entered Melilla of a suspected heart attack.
""The preliminary results of the autopsy indicate there is no external injury which caused his death,"" the statement said.
Another migrant died on the Moroccan side of the border in the attempt to cross over to Melilla.
Moroccan authorities arrested 141 people as they tried to cross.
Several Spanish Catholic associations which aid migrants issued a joint statement condemning the quick expulsion of the migrants from Melilla.
""Speed is not always a symptom of efficiency when what is at stake is people's lives and future,"" it said.
Melilla, together with a second Spanish enclave, Ceuta, have the European Union's only land borders with Africa.
Over 47,000 migrants have made it north to Spain since the start of the year, including about 5,000 by land, according to the International Organisation for Migration.
An increasing number of Moroccans are attempting to reach Europe, either by taking the perilous sea route or via the Spanish enclaves of Ceuta and Melilla, which border Morocco.
Morocco, which many Africans can visit without visas, has become a major gateway for sub-Saharan migrants into Europe.
Moroccan authorities say they have stopped some 54,000 attempts by migrants to cross into Spain this year.

""What I do say is that the situation in Syria is the cause of a large part of the problems we are currently having in Europe,"" he added, speaking on COPE radio station.
""Settling the situation in Syria is of capital importance.""
Millions of people have fled Syria to escape its civil war, according to the United Nations, swelling to hundreds of thousands the numbers of migrants arriving in Europe over recent months.
In the latest shocking sign of the migrants' plight, photographs of a small Syrian boy washed up dead on a Turkish beach made front pages around Europe on Thursday.
""The photograph is truly tragic. It is horrifying,"" Rajoy said. ""And it is a sign of something that is happening often. Many women and children have died in the Mediterranean"" while trying to reach Europe by sea.
Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad is battling various armed groups including the jihadist movement Islamic State.
""Islamic State controls a large part of the country,"" Rajoy said. ""The West cannot allow that for the dignity of the Syrian people.""
Rajoy has faced demands for Spain to host a greater number of refugees, but he did not shift his position on Thursday.
He has said Spain, home to nearly 47 million people, is willing to receive 2,739 registered asylum seekers in 2015. He has implied his country might agree to take more but that any future quotas should take into account the country's high unemployment rate.
His political opponents in Spain ahead of December's general election have criticised his government's reaction to the migrant crisis.
The leader of the left-wing protest party Podemos, Pablo Iglesias, complained that Europe spent more on guarding its borders than on helping refugees.
""Europe has spent €1.208 billion on strengthening its borders and 700 million on helping refugees,"" Iglesias told radio station Cadena Ser on Thursday.

The number of illegal immigrants entering Spain through Ceuta and Melilla alone increased by more than half during 2014 compared to the year before with a surge in refugees arriving from Syria.
But although the headlines have given the most attention to those attempting to cross into the enclaves by climbing the fences, the majority of those who entered Spain did so with forged documentaton presented at the border.
The total of 12,549 illegal immigrants in 2014 was a big jump from the year before when 7,472 entered Spain illegally, according to Spanish Interior Ministry information.
The new figures were given by the Interior Minister in a written response to a parliamentary question by MP Jon Inarritu of the Basque pro-independence party Amaiur.
The parliamentatrian told The Local that he had asked for the data because he believed the government was being opaque about actions at Spain's borders.
The data, published by Europa Press on Monday, showed that Syrians comprised the largest group of migrants and that about 60 percent of all those arriving in Spain entered through its north African enclaves.
In Ceuta, 1,666 people entered illegally while another 5,819 entered Melilla without permission in 2014 - up from a combined total of 4,235 people who entered both cities in 2013.
Most used false documentation to enter, according to the report.
In Melilla for example 2,861 used falsified documents while 2,069 climbed over border fences, 236 arrived on boats, 79 in vehicles and 574 through ""other"" methods.
Of the overall 12,549 who entered the country without permission, the biggest single nationality were Syrians who numbered 3,305 people and virtually all of them obtained entry at the Melilla and Ceuta borders using fake documentation.
Cameroon was the second-highest nationality at 1,556, followed by Algeria (1,395) and Morocco (1,183).The data has upset the parliamentarian who requested it because he believes too much is being made of Spain's immigration problem while not enough is done for the vulnerable trying to reach here.
""It shows that Spain is one of the EU nation states that accepts the fewest number of asylum seekers,"" Iñarritu told The Local.
""The PP government is always focusing on the trouble Spain has with migrants jumping the fence yet the data shows that a bigger problem exists with those entering at legal crossings with false papers,"" Iñarritu said.
""There is a real problem in respect of human rights at the border. The government seems determined to blatantly ignore the criticisms from international authorities over the treatment of migrants. And it's a disgrace for Spain.""
He also questioned why the figures released by the Interior Ministry failed to show the number of illegal immigrants who had entered through Spain's airports.
""Historically, the vast number of those who end up as illegal immigrants to Spain come from Latin America and enter at Barajas airport, yet those figures were not released,"" he said.
""So I am asking for clarification,""
An asylum expert consulted by The Local also pointed out the true illegal immigration figures could be much higher.
""It is very atypical that people go over borders, but that is what the focus is on for security,"" Spanish immigration lawyer Noemí Alarcón told The Local.
""The norm is to go through the airports,"" she said.
Spanish leaders called for more international cooperation in combating illegal immigration at a meeting on Monday of Euro-Mediterranean leaders in Barcelona focused on immigration and terrorism.
The country has stepped up security in the African cities in recent years, pledging €2.1 million ($2.9 million) last year to boost border enforcement between Morocco and the territories.
The conflict in Syria has been waging on for four years, resulting in about 4 million refugees, many of whom have fled to neighbouring Turkey, Iraq, Egypt and Lebanon.
Spain has been slammed for its treatment of immigrants at its borders with Morocco.
In a report last month human rights organization Amnesty International accused Spain of carrying out unlawful deportations to Morocco and the unnecessary or excessive use of force by law enforcement officials at the enclave borders."

					14:25 CET+01:00				",AFP,Amnesty slams treatment of migrants in Spain enclaves,"Amnesty International on Tuesday denounced conditions for migrants arriving in Spain's overseas territories of Melilla and Ceuta, where they said asylum rights were not always respected.
After interviewing some 50 people in both north African enclaves that neighbour Morocco, the group said migrants who arrived there had at times experienced police abuse, and vulnerable people such as homosexuals or victims of domestic violence were not given adequate protection.
Spain's interior ministry did not comment on the report.
Ceuta and Melilla are favoured entry points for African migrants seeking to get to Europe, who attempt to climb over complex border systems made of high fences which they sometimes hang on to for hours, or swim along the coast.
Spanish and Moroccan authorities have been cooperating to prevent migrants crossing from the African side of the borders into the enclaves.
""There are videos where you can see how Moroccan police hit (migrants)... make them fall and send them away,"" Amnesty said, adding that Spanish officers turned a blind eye.
Once in Spanish territory, migrants are taken to temporary detention centres used to hold people while officials decide whether or not they will be deported, but the journey is far from over.
""The majority of people asking for asylum, except those of Syrian nationality, find themselves blocked in the limbo that is Ceuta and Melilla,"" said Esteban Beltran, director of Amnesty International Spain.
The interior ministry said more than 11,600 migrants and refugees arrived in Ceuta and Melilla last year, the majority from Syria - a 55 percent increase from 2014. The combined population of the two enclaves is just over 170,000.
Syrians' asylum requests are usually acted upon immediately, as they do not have to prove that they are in danger - their country being in the midst of conflict.
Other nationalities have a tougher time, says Amnesty, and asylum procedures are not always respected.
As an example, the group said, ""the red, asylum-seeker card should allow freedom of movement in all Spanish territory, but this right is not respected in Ceuta and Melilla"".
Amnesty said the detention centres also failed to protect the most vulnerable, such as homosexuals.
In Melilla's centre, at least 60 people have asked for asylum for being persecuted in their home countries for their sexual orientation, and some have been waiting between six months and a year.
Amnesty said they had suffered discrimination from other people in the centre, threats and even assaults.
Amnesty called for Spain to guarantee the immediate transfer to the peninsula of those who are particularly vulnerable, and stop cooperating on migration control with neighbouring Morocco, which it accused of violating refugees' rights.

					18:24 CET+01:00				",George Mills,'Spaniards are more critical of Europe now',"As protesters take to the streets in the Ukraine, The Local talks to Spanish foreign policy analyst Alicia Sorroza about the implications for Europe as a whole and Spain in particular.
In late November, the Ukrainian Government pulled out of a deal which would have meant tighter relations with the European Union (EU). This led to allegations that the country had bowed to Russian pressure — claims that Russian President Vladimir Putin strongly denied. The political situation in the country has since deteriorated with opposition protesters taking to the streets to voice their anger. On Wednesday riot police stormed the barricades set up by protesters in what The Economist called a botched crackdown. On Friday, opposition leaders sat down with President Viktor Yanukovych for tense talks. With the situation still, unclear, The Local spoke to Spanish foreign policy analyst Alicia Sorroza about what events in the Ukraine mean for Europe and Spain. What is the significance of the crisis in the Ukraine for Europe? There are many implications of the crisis. Ukraine is a frontier state with borders to Slovakia and Poland among other countries. It also has strong historic, cultural and economic links with Europe. Then there is, of course, the energy issue with Russian gas coming to Europe via the Ukraine. But the current crisis is also about configuring the power game in the east of Europe. Russia is on a high at the moment, with diplomatic successes with Iran (a nuclear non-proliferation treaty) and Syria (a decision to scrap chemical weapons stockpiles), and the Ukraine would add to that list. At the same time, the European diplomatic machinery has kicked in to capitalize on recent success at the summit of Vilnius (which saw the EU sign important cooperation agreements with Georgia and Moldova). For the Ukraine though, it's not the case of one or the other. The country has economic problems and Russia is more willing to supply money, whereas Europe doesn't want to get caught up in a bidding war. And what are implications of the situation in the Ukraine for Spain? Spain doesn't have any key interests in the Ukraine, but Spain was very involved in the success of the summit in Vilnius, in terms of participating and giving opinions.
At the same time, by playing a role in eastern Europe, Spain can also reinforce its position in the EU as well as consolidate its success in southern European diplomacy (including the Union for the Mediterranean in which Spain plays a key role). When Spain makes friends in the east, it can also gain allies for its southern European diplomacy. Spain's involvement with the Ukraine also has Spain playing a slightly different diplomatic role in terms of Russia. Spain has good relations with Russia — not deep, but strong. There have been high level visits between the two countries, and Spain didn't support the independence of Kosovo, siding with Serbia, and therefore Russia. But now in the case of the Ukraine, Spain has taken the EU position. Has Spain become less pro-Europe given the economic crisis in the eurozone? No. Despite everything, Spaniards remain in favour of Europe — not to as great an extent as fifteen years ago, but there is still a lot of popular support. I would say, though, that Spaniards are now more critical towards Europe than before. It's not necessarily an issue that the whole society is engaged in, but the crisis is there on television every day and people have a more mature attitude toward the EU. They no longer see Europe as a panacea for everything. In diplomatic terms, Spain is very strongly pro-Europe. In European affairs, Spain works with the EU and is working towards forging a joint EU foreign policy. Spain is also working hard to push for the formation of a unified banking system in the EU.

Now, many are coming back to Galicia -- or at least their descendants are -- escaping an acute crisis in Venezuela for the remote Spanish region and lured by authorities there faced with an ageing population.
Carlos Veiga, a 44-year-old from Caracas whose parents were from Galicia, arrived in Vigo, an industrial coastal city surrounded by green mountains, in November with his wife and two sons.
And swapping the Caribbean for the rough, stormy sea of the Atlantic was a shock.
""We arrived and they had to send me and my son to hospital urgently for alung infection because of the cold and rain,"" he tells AFP.
""Thanks to my parents, I was able to get the Spanish nationality, which I never thought I would use.""
Grandchildren, great-grandchildren
Back in Venezuela, Veiga was kidnapped for ransom. The ordeal only lasted a few hours, but it was the last straw for him.

That, and a general lack of medicine in Venezuela, including vaccines for his kids, pushed him to leave the country.
He is one of thousands who have escaped in the past years, many opting to come to Spain despite its recent economic crisis and sky-high unemployment.
Of these, thousands go to Galicia, where incentives are promoted by authorities encouraging migrants to return to a region that saw part of its population flee poverty for Latin America in the 20th century.
The regional government has said it will provide €2.2 million ($2.6 million) in aid this year for migrants who return.
""Galicia has demographic problems, a high rate of elderly people,"" said Antonio Rodriguez Miranda, in charge of migration for the regional government.
""Many people left and now they can go full circle and their grandchildren or great-grandchildren can return to their homeland.""
Galicia has some 2.7 million inhabitants, of whom close to 24,300 are Venezuelan, according to the last official statistics from January 2017.
Venezuelan Susana (L) and her mother (no name given) pose in Vigo, northwestern Spain.
But Venezuelan associations say the number of arrivals has soared since then.
Eight out of every 10 people who ask for the subsidy for returning migrants are Venezuelan, according to the regional government.
Veiga was unable to sell off his construction company in Venezuela, just like many others in the country where the deep economic crisis is hindering the sale of property or goods to emigrate.
So he lives off a subsidy of €428 a month, expected to last 18 months.
But despite the financial struggle, he says his family is recovering ""a quality of life that we lost in Caracas"".
Torn between both countries
Hermosinda Perez left the coastal Galician town of Muros when she was 17 in the 1950s, when Venezuela's massive oil reserves brought promises of a brighter future.
Six decades later, she returned to Galicia with a heavy heart, as there was no oxygen available in Venezuela for her husband's pulmonary emphysema.
""It's sad, because I came back to my country, but that (Venezuela) is my country too,"" the 80-year-old says darkly in the living room of the two-bedroom flat in central Vigo she shares with her 43-year-old daughter, son-in-law and two granddaughters, who are eight and six.
""I never thought I would come back. I was fine out there, I have it all there, the house, a beach flat, my life,"" she says.
Perez can't get her Venezuelan pension as Caracas stopped paying it to people abroad two years ago, so she relies on her daughter who along with her husband invested their savings in a small cigarette shop in Vigo.
With Spain's 16.7 percent unemployment rate jobs are scarce, but Venezuelans still find posts in restaurants, factories, call centres or as cleaners.
Venezuelans Monica Janeiro (R) and Briahayan Diaz pose in Vigo.
But for Monica Janeiro, these difficulties are worth it.
Her family had to rely on the Caritas charity for food vouchers and on the Red Cross for courses to enter the job market.
""I may not have much, but we lead a tranquil life and compared to Venezuela, it's great,"" she says.

The ministers agreed by a large majority to the plan with just four EU members — Czech Republic, Hungary, Romania and Slovakia — voting against it.
The UN and other international organizations warned it was the ""last chance"" for increasingly overwhelmed European states to agree on how to cope with the tide of people fleeing conflict in countries like Syria, Afghanistan.
Luxembourg Foreign Minister Jean Asselborn, who is chairing the meeting, said: ""We have a text on the table which should deliver an agreement. It is very balanced. I think it will have a good influence on all the delegations so we can reach a result this evening.""
Spain has previously said it would accept 15,000 Syrian refugees after facing pressure from the population to do more for those fleeing war. Initially Spain had rejected the EU quota and said it would welcome less than 2,500 people.

""I want to confirm that both the interior minister and myself... will unequivocally reject any effort to introduce a permanent mechanism of refugee redistribution,"" Czech Prime Minister Sobotka told reporters in Prague.
""We also reject the introduction of quotas,"" he added.
The deal could be ratified by European Union leaders at a crisis summit on Wednesday, which will focus on wider issues of strengthening the bloc's external borders.
Tensions have kept boiling over, with fears that the EU's Schengen passport-free zone could be under threat from the tide of migrants, many of whom are trying to make their way to Germany.
German Interior Minister Thomas de Maziere, whose country is set to take in around one million asylum seekers this year, previously said he was ""optimistic"" that they could reach a deal but warned that the talks would be difficult.
""In the end I am optimistic but it's not done yet,"" he said."

It was an emotional meeting after Adou from the Ivory Coast was discovered last month by authorities curled up inside a suitcase at the border crossing in Ceuta, in an attempt to join his parents in Spain.
His father Ali Ouattara had tried to arrange through an intermediary for his son to reunite with the rest of the family, who are in Spain legally, but later admitted that he had no idea it would mean Adou ending up inside of a suitcase.
The story of the ""suitcase boy"" has stirred controversy and highlighted the plight of some migrants willing to go to extreme lengths in order to make it to Europe.
But it could still take some time before the family is fully whole again. Ali has been in on remand in prison since Adou was discovered, facing criminal charges for the smuggling attempt, for which he paid traffickers €5,000. He believed it would buy his son documentation and a way into Spain.
Just two hours before meeting their son, Lucie paid her husband's bail of €5,000 so that the family could be together, newspaper El Pais reported.
After receiving the bail money, a court has ordered the release of the the father from his prison in Algeciras, though he must still appear before court once a month and is barred from leaving the country, according to newspaper ABC.
El Pais wrote that Adou and Lucie will be on their way by ferry to cross the Strait of Gibraltar to the mainland to see his father.
Ali Ouattara told a court previously that he had repeatedly tried to bring his son into the country through legal means to join his wife and eldest daughter in the Canary Island of Fuertaventura, but had failed because his monthly salary was just €41 short, according to a report in El Pais.

The boy, Adou, was ultimately reunited with his mother and father in June, while his father faces charges for the smuggling attempt.
Many migrants seek to cross into the country through Spain's two north African territories, Melilla and Ceuta, which are also Europe's only land border with Africa.
Spain has also complained about EU plans to more evenly distribute asylum seekers across the countries through a quota system, saying Spain already makes great efforts to control African migration.
The country rejected the compulsory quota plan during a summit in Brussels last month, saying Spain would only take in one-third of the number of people agreed upon on the plan.

					11:06 CEST+02:00				",Emma Anderson ,Should Ukraine join the EU? Spaniards think so,"Nearly two-thirds of Spaniards polled by Pew Research Center said they were in favour of Ukraine joining the European Union, more than any other NATO country surveyed.
According to the Pew report published on Wednesday, 65 percent of Spanish respondents said they thought Ukraine should join the EU in response to the conflict involving Russia.
Spaniards supported this idea more than any of the other NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization) nations surveyed in the poll.
Germans, Italians and French respondents all voiced more opposition to Ukraine becoming part of the EU, with more than 50 percent of respondents in both Germany and France saying they opposed Ukrainian EU membership. In Italy, just 37 percent supported Ukraine joining while 47 percent said they were against the idea.
Pew conducted the survey to reflect how citizens of NATO countries view the Ukrainian conflict and the role that the intergovernmental military alliance should play.
While many NATO respondents, including those in Spain, said they thought the US would defend its allies militarily if they got into a conflict with Russia, many seemed reluctant for their own country to act.
In Spain, 70 percent said the US would help its NATO allies if Russia became a threat, but respondents were more divided on whether Spain should do the same in such a situation.
Almost half, (48 percent) said Spain should militarily defend another NATO ally against Russia, while 47 percent said the country should not get involved.
In the Ukrainian conflict, Spaniards expressed the most enthusiasm for sending economic support to Ukraine with 77 percent responding that Western countries should provide such aid to the conflict-torn country.
But Spaniards, like most of the other NATO countries, were reluctant to provide arms to the Ukraine. Only a quarter of Spanish respondents said they thought NATO should provide arms to the Ukrainian government.
Poland, Canada and the United States were the only countries where a larger portion of people supported sending arms than those who opposed it.
While Polish respondents were most worried about Russia becoming a military threat to other neighbouring countries, many Spaniards also saw this as a concern. Just 10 percent said Russia was not a threat to nearby nations while 49 percent said Russia was a major threat and 38 percent saw it as a minor threat.
""There is widespread public concern in some NATO member states that Russia poses a military threat to neighboring countries aside from Ukraine,"" the Pew report said.
However, Spaniards also expressed the least positive views of NATO, with 47 percent saying they had a favourable view of the alliance - making Spain the only country where less than half of the people had a positive perspective on NATO.
This is a drop since 2009 when 56 percent of Spaniards expressed positive opinions about the organisation.
Poland showed the highest positivity at 74 percent."

""Among them was a major businessman in the gas sector in Ukraine,"" the statement said. Approached by AFP, a police spokeswoman refused to identify the oligarch.
But Spanish media named him as Firtash, one of Ukraine's richest men, who made a fortune importing gas to Ukraine from Russia and Central Asia via his group Rosukrenergo in collaboration with Russian gas giant Gazprom.
ABC said Firtash was accused of ""close links with organised crime and having laundered 10 million euros ($10.6 million) in Spain that came from suspected criminal activities"".
Firtash was arrested in 2014 in Austria before being released on bail set at 125 million euros. Austrian authorities refused a request for his extradition in April last year to the United States, where he was accused of corruption and membership of a criminal organisation.
He was suspected of bribing civil servants in India in 2006 in order to secure titanium mining licences. Spanish police, announcing the arrest warrant, also said five suspected members of the same network had been arrested Thursday in Barcelona and in the southern resort of Marbella.
A police spokeswoman told AFP they were all Spanish nationals, describing them as ""second-tier collaborators"" in the enterprise -- three lawyers and two bank employees who allegedly facilitated the money laundering.
In an initial operation against the network in July, 12 people were arrested including Stepan Chernovetsky, son of colourful former Kiev mayor Leonid Chernovetsky, who founded major bank Pravex.
Police said the network had laundered illicit gains from companies based mainly in Cyprus and the Virgin Islands.
