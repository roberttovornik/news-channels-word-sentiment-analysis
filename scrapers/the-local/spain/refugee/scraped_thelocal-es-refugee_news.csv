					11:00 CEST+02:00				",Emma Anderson ,'Refugees welcome' in Spain: So where are they?,"Spaniards across the country have organized groups to welcome refugees into the culture, but the actual number of people Spain has taken in is strikingly low - just 18 in the past six months.
Spain agreed to take in roughly 15,000 refugees from overwhelmed Greece and Italy under an EU redistribution plan, but over the last six months, the country has fulfilled just 0.1 percent of this promise - bringing in 18 people, according to Spanish NGOs.
The first 18 refugees under the EU agreement from September arrived in Spain at the end of last year. But even when the first group of a dozen stepped foot onto Spanish soil in November, NGOs questioned then why it had taken so long and why there were so few.
Since December, there have been no further groups coming to Spain under the redistribution plan, according to El Pais.
Big cities like Barcelona and Madrid planned a network across the country for citizens to register to have refugees stay in their homes in anticipation of the thousands who would arrive.
But instead, Barcelona has been disappointed and ""filled with rage"" by the low number of arrivals, the city’s left-wing mayor Ada Colau said earlier this year.
Spanish politicians have blamed the slow movement on the ""complexity"" of coordination and acting Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy said last weekend that the EU plan was not going ""as fast as [he’d] like"".
""There are things that could be done better. Things are moving slowly,"" he said, according to El Pais.
Rajoy was confronted by opponents about his ""passivity"" on the issue on Wednesday in Congress, with Ciudadanos leader Albert Rivera saying that ""it is not worth having quotas if you do not carry them through.""
NGO Save the Children Spain also shipped to the acting Prime Minister a pair of shoes from a five-year-old Syrian refugee girl who is among the thousands waiting in camps in Idomeni, Greece, hoping the border with Macedonia will open.
The NGO said the girl, Hala, is not able to ""take another step further"" with the shoes, but Rajoy can.

The Interior Ministry announced last month that a second group of 450 refugees would be brought to the country, but this has not yet happened.
The government also reportedly informed both the UN commissioner for refugees as well as the European Commission that it was willing to take in more people from Greece and Italy.
But when asked why these groups had not yet arrived in Spain, the interior ministry said that there were ""procedural implications"" under the EU quota plan that have delayed their arrival, including ""the need to provide information about the country of relocation to the potential beneficiaries, security-related issues, and issues that are not completely resolved"".
""Spain cannot act alone,"" the interior ministry told El Pais.
Spain received a total 14,600 first time asylum applicants in 2015, according to Eurostat, but has continued to face pressure from its own citizenship to take in more asylum seekers and criticism for its initial reluctance to adopt the EU quota agreement.
NGOs and Barcelona blame Spanish as well as European leaders for dragging their feet on the matter.
""Here there is not a problem of lack of money or infrastructure, but a lack of political will,"" explained Estrella Galán, secretary general of the Spanish Commission for Helping Refugees (CEAR), referring to the more than €200 million budgeted for refugee care.
The Red Cross of Spain said that in contrast, the EU has been quick to send back immigrants in Greece to Turkey under a controversial agreement where European countries take in one recognized Syrian refugee from Turkey for every Syrian Turkey takes back from having gone illegally to Europe.
""The government says that there’s a problem with red tape at the European level, especially with the identification of refugees in Greece,"" said Cristina Domínguez of the Spanish Red Cross to El Pais.
""They cast blame on one another. But I suppose that the refugees who are now being deported to Turkey also will have to register and this is being done much more quickly."""

But less than half of those who applied for asylum in Spain were successful in their application.
Of the 15,755 people who applied, only 6,855 (43.5 percent) were granted asylum and 3,395 refugees (21.6 percent) had their applications denied outright.
The remaining 5,505 are still waiting for their applications to be processed.
The figures released by the Spanish Refugee Council (CEAR) reveal that those fleeing the civil war in Syria have had the most success with asylum applications.
Some 90 percent of all those applications accepted – amounting to 6,215 – were from Syrians. However, only 355 have actually been awarded full refugee status with the remaining 6,500 applicants given a form of “subsidiary” protection which is open to review.
While the figures reveal that Spain is welcoming more refugees than ever before, the number of asylum seekers who make their home here is just a tiny percentage of those accepted into Europe as a whole.
According to figures from Eurostat, EU nations received a total of 1.26 million asylum requests during 2016 with Spain receiving just 1.3 percent of that figure.
Germany recieved by far the greatest number of asylum seekers in Europe, with close to three-quarter of a million applications.
Of those asylum seekers who arrived in Spain, four in every ten people were female. The figures for how many children were among them were not released.
Spain’s refugee council insisted that more should be done to help asylum seekers and said that Spain was failing on its legal obligation to process applications rapidly as some 20,370 applications were pending by the end of 2016.
“We need more human and financial resources to reduce the agonising wait for these poor people, many of whose lives depend upon the ultimate decision,” said Paloma Favieres. Legal services coordinator at CEAR.
“Countries are legally obliged to complete applications in six months, but this rarely happens.”
The human rights group also slammed Spain for limiting successful applications in the majority of cases to those from Syria.
“Spain has limited to the maximum level the right to asylum for those who are fleeing countries other than Syria,” said CEAR in their report."

					11:08 CEST+02:00				", The Local,Spain slammed for refugee crisis 'failure',"A new report has slammed Spain has for not keeping its promises on helping with the refugee crisis.
The paper from NGO Oxfam Intermón, entitled “Spain has failed in response to the global refugee crisis” has been released ahead of the first Leaders’ Summit on the Global Refugee Crisis in New York.
The report points out that Spain has so far taken in only one percent of the roughly 15,000 refugees it agreed to house in an EU redistribution plan which was designed to take some of the load away from overwhelmed Greece and Italy.
“Spain is very far away from fulfilling its promises,” the Oxfam Intermón paper states. “The Spanish Government has only followed through with one percent of the amount it committed to: 201 of the 15,888 people it promised to take have arrived.”
Oxfam Intermón highlights Spain’s position as one of the top 20 economies in the world, and claims that resources are not lacking, but rather the “political will” to respond to the refugee crisis.
As evidence, the NGO points out that according to government figures, Spain spends around €40 million annually in repairing and reinforcing border fences at North African territories Cueta and Melilla alone. In 2016 meanwhile the budget it allocated to the CETI refugee centres was less than half of that, €16.3 million.
The paper concludes that Spain should use the forthcoming Leaders’ Summit on the Global Refugee Crisis to “make a radical change to its migration policy and start down a new path on its displacement agenda where human rights prevail over any other politics,"" instead of its present “more than dubious role as an example in the EU for being efficient at the infringement of human rights""."

Cities across Spain are in the process of setting up a register so that residents that volunteer to put up refugees in their homes. Barcelona was first to announce the scheme, swiftly followed by Madrid and a dozen other cities. No clear guidelines have yet been drawn up but the scheme should be in place within weeks so if you are keen to give up your spare room for a very good cause ask your local council.
Volunteer

One of the big challenges of arriving in a new country is inevitably the language. Various organizations offer services to help refugees navigate jumping through the daily hoops of legal documents, work applications, healthcare systems and more, like the Service of Translators and Interpreters (SETI) in Madrid.
SETI is recruits volunteers who can translate Spanish for refugees for various legal documents and other everyday tasks.
If you have other skills to offer, or just some free time to help out groups working with migrants, then there are lots of opprtunities. For example, the Bienvenidos Refugiados movement is also looking for volunteers to help them research further ways to help refugees and join a team to help direct those interested in getting involved.
Other groups are looking for drivers to help migrant families get around if they have to make a journey from one part of the country to another.
Donate money

There are many non-profit organisations that are involved in various aspects of the influx of refugees, from rescuing people on the Mediterranean, to giving medical treatment to those who arrive to providing resources to those who are able to stay.
One of the main agencies is the United Nations Refugee Agency, known as ACNUR in Spain. You can choose to make a one-time donation or regular donations over a certain period of time.
But there are also lots of smaller charities to choose from.

The mural depicts a girl in a nightgown, bloodied from the head down and posed as if she were leaning against the building on which she is drawn, perhaps peering into the distance. Below her also appears to be a floor covered in blood.
Across from her in a forest is a naked, handcuffed body, pierced by arrows.
The work is that of Gonzalo Borondo, an artist born in the Spanish city of Valladolid who started getting serious about street art when he moved to Madrid at the age of 14 to attend the Academy of Fine Arts. He left his tags all around the city, using different materials like charcoal, oil and tempera.
His father was a restorer and he grew up around classical paintings, from which he draws his inspiration. He particularly loves Goya, whose dark influence is immediately apparent in his work.
His latest piece is one of many larger-than-life painted political statements that add to Berlin’s charm as an avant-garde city, and which draw tourists each year to walking tours of its street art.
But the 42-metre-high mural on a wall in the Tegel neighbourhood of north Berlin has left residents feeling anything but charmed.

“It’s very, very frightening,” one mother of a five-year-old boy who attends a nearby Kindergarten told Berlin daily Tagesspiegel on Wednesday.
“The worst is the impaled man… There is so much suffering in the world, but you don’t have to also present it to us in such a big way.”
The mother isn’t alone: other residents in the neighbourhood have started to collect signatures to petition for the painting to be removed.
The mural is supposed to be related to the refugee crisis, according to a spokesman from the housing association Gewobag, which commissioned the art.
It is part of a series called Artpark Tegel which so far consists of five murals by the street art network Urban Nation.
There is also sensitivity to the graphic work because several people have killed themselves by jumping off the building next door, Felix Schönebeck, a spokesman for the neighbourhood initiative I Love Tegel told Tagesspiegel.
Then there is the refugee home being planned for the area.
""There will be people living there who fled from wars and lived through horrible things. For this reason I also find the image inappropriate,"" said 26-year-old law student.
But the spokesman from Gewobag said the picture depicts hope as well as pain.

My mother was only a little Basque girl of seven when General Franco and his troops rebelled against the democratically elected government of the Spanish Republic. It was 1936 and the Spanish Civil War would go on for almost three years with a death toll of half million and further 450,000 fleeing into exile.

My mother, along with her family, who at the time lived in Bilbao, escaped to the family farm in Bakio, as Bilbao was becoming increasingly more dangerous because of Franco’s bombings.
In Bakio they thought they were safe, and they also had food, which was scarce in Bilbao. Bakio is only 13 kms from Gernika, and my mother always remembered how on April 26th 1937, dozens of planes passed over their heads with a deafening noise. They all ran for a place to hide.
After the Gernika massacre, my grandmother, my mother, her eldest sister and some siblings were sent by the Basque government to the city of Pau in the south of France, far from their beloved, but insecure farm.

The Conservative party was not very convinced by the idea, but people in England and Wales welcomed the children with open arms.
For eight months my mother and her sister went to school in France, they learnt French, took piano lessons, played with the local children and most of all tried to put all the suffering they had gone through behind them.

Eventually they chose to return home. They did not want to leave their father, and decided to share the coming difficulties together. Even though it had been a short stay of eight months those days were very much treasured in my mother and her sister’s hearts. France was the best country in the world and its citizens the nicest. Nobody could dispute that.
Now I see the Syrian refugees in the media, and can’t help thinking of my family; tired, scared, hungry with a look of incredulity in their eyes, as though they were not able to grasp their new reality from a year earlier. They had families, jobs, houses, schools, and dreams. Now very little of those remain.

Some of the European governments have been extremely intolerant of the refugees. Callous and lacking in empathy, they have seen the refugees as a problem rather than human beings with problems. Fortunately more and more people are reacting and trying to give them back the dignity they deserve. The same happened 80 years ago.
Despite all the hardships she had to face in life, my mother never lost faith in her fellow human beings. Perhaps that was the supreme lesson she learnt when she was still a child. It is time for us to learn it too.

The photograph shows a man in his early thirties with a smile lighting up his face as he poses next to pop icon Kylie Minogue.
For any fan to come face to face with their musical hero it can be an emotional moment, but for Jalal Maher it was an impossible dream come true.
At the time he was living in an over-crowded refugee camp on the outskirts of Madrid having fled war torn Syria.
The star pulled him up on stage during a concert in Madrid after seeing him brandishing a sign stating that he was from Syria and rewarding him for the weeks it took him to save up for the ticket.
Watch the video:
Now, ten months later and having just been granted residency in Spain, Maher reflects on how for those willing to embrace Spanish culture and work hard, the country is nothing but welcoming.
The Syrian conflict has brought to Europe’s doorstep the greatest refugee crisis since the Second World War. Around 45 percent of its population has been displaced with 4 million having fled the country to find safety, and Maher is one of them.
He considers himself lucky; as an only son he wasn’t obliged to fight in the Syrian Army, and with an uncle already living in Spain, he was able to get a visa to visit him. Then, in July 2014, he applied for asylum and was placed in the Vallecas refugee center in the southeast of Madrid.
Maher wants to give ""inspiration and hope"" to Syrians in Europe, encouraging them to study hard and prove to Europeans that they are an asset to society.
""We are ambitious people, we are intelligent people, and we do not want to survive on government handouts,"" he explained over coffee at a central Madrid café. ""We want to build up the reputation of Syrians and to be held in high esteem.""
Jalal proudly tells The Local that on his first day at the refugee center, he asked about the Spanish lessons on offer. ""But they said to me 'Wait!' You’ve only just arrived!’""
But he was adamant. He joined all of the classes he could and months later, ended up getting the top marks of all those to take the Official School of Spanish exam.

Since leaving the camp he has secured a job teaching English, which he learnt in Syria, and just last week received the news that he had been given Spanish residency.
Spain has seen a surge in illegal immigration with 68 percent more attempting to cross its borders in 2014 from the year before, among them some 3,300 Syrians.
But since rejecting the EU quota plan Spain has faced criticism for not pulling its weight and shouldering its share of the burden when it comes to asylum seekers.
It said it would relocate just 1,300 migrants as part of the scheme, a figure representing less than a third of the commission’s original proposal, but as far as Maher is concerned, Spain has been nothing but welcoming.
""I’ve been here for a year and a half and I can’t think of a single incident of being treated badly. I am in love with the Spanish people and the Spanish culture. If you offered me any other nationality now I would say no, I want to be Spanish.""
He is, however, willing to admit that Spain isn’t top of the list for most of his fellow refugees who dream of ending up in Germany or Sweden.

""Everyone wants to go to Germany or Sweden and many of them try and reach there from Spain but if they are caught they are sent back to Spain. But people talk and they know that if they reach those countries from Greece they are likely to be granted asylum.""
He points out that the help offered to refugees in Spain - €100 a month, as well as food, accommodation and money towards training to help get a job - is generous but is limited to six months.
""I think that especially for families in need, this help for a limited time only is really not enough. But what can we do? Spain is going through a big crisis and can’t even help its own people.""
Maher says that every penny he can spare goes towards his family back in Syria. “My next step is to try and save my sister and her family who are still stuck in Syria. She worries about me being in a strange land but I say ‘Honey, it is you who is living in the strange land. You don’t have the basic human rights. I’m not even talking politics but water, electricity, safety,'"" he explains.
Sending money into Syria is near impossible but he tries to send what he can through a network of friends and family. Each week he buys lottery tickets in the hope that his dreams will be answered with a big win.
""I want to send for my family to bring them here but I can’t sponsor them officially because I don’t yet have the assets,"" he said, adding that there are alternative illegal routes to be considered.
""But such methods are expensive and very risky,"" he admitted.
""If I should be so lucky why can't they?""

Europe's refugee crisis has become a popular cause for Spain's left-wing leaders, who are channelling public sentiment to pressure the government into a more generous stance.
Despite lingering hardship from Spain's economic crisis, many families have offered to receive refugees in their homes, and cities like Madrid are putting forward millions of euros to help.
City halls, charities and impromptu Facebook groups are marshalling offers of aid and urging the government to open Spain up to refugees who are risking their lives to reach Europe from trouble spots such as Syria.san
""I am proud of the expressions and initiatives of solidarity by so many Spanish people in response to these tragedies,"" wrote Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy, responding to an open letter from Barcelona mayor Ada Colau.
Accused by the left of dragging its feet as Europe faces its worst refugee crisis since World War II, the government on Tuesday agreed to take in however many the European Commission demands - a figure likely to be around 15,000.
The apparent change in policy comes after months of action by city councils and concerned citizens, many organised by groups linked to Spain's anti-austerity ""Indignado"" movement.
On August 29th, Colau called for the establishment of a ""network of cities of refuge to give a home to thousands of civilians fleeing from war"".

Since then, more than 100 cities have taken up the call, among them Madrid, Valencia and Zaragoza, the mayor said, adding: ""While states look for excuses, the cities have got organised.""

Across Spain, countless citizen groups have also sprung up to support the refugees.
One in the northern region of Asturias says it has received thousands of messages of support since launching on Facebook last week.
'Tired of just crying'
""It's incredible,"" said one of the organisers, Betty Menendez, a 35-year-old housewife.
""We have 350 families that are ready to host and another 400 offers of help of all kinds: lawyers, dentists, doctors, translators, carers, Spanish teachers, everything.""
Menendez said she was ""tired of just crying at the news on television"".
She and her husband are now offering to put up a refugee in their 54-square-metre (80-square-foot) apartment in the bedroom normally occupied by their 18-month-old toddler.
""The house is very small, but we would give them food, a bed and a shower, and the freedom to come and go,"" she said.
European Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker will on Wednesday unveil a plan for urgently resettling 120,000 migrants across EU member states, with Germany likely to take in more than 31,000, France some 24,000, and Spain almost 15,000, a source told AFP.
Until Tuesday, Rajoy's conservative government, which is to contest a general election in December, and insisted it would only take in 2,739 refugees this year.
In response, more than 245,000 people signed a petition on the website change.org calling on the Spanish government to ""immediately open the doors to refugees"".
In an apparent U-turn, Deputy Prime Minister Soraya Sáenz de Santamaría on Tuesday said that ""Spain will accept the number of refugees that the European Union asks us to take"".
With a population of nearly 47 million, Spain accounts for 9.1 percent of the EU's population, but last year it took in less than one percent of the bloc's asylum applications, UN figures showed. In all, it granted refugee status to just 384 people.
Monica Oltra Jarque, deputy leader of the Valencia region and a member of the left-wing party Compromis, said there was room in Spain for plenty more.
""If each Spanish town took just one family, we could host 20,000 families,"" she said.

""Spain can and must do better, not only by setting up a decent resettlement programme but also by increasing the numbers,"" said Virginia Alvarez, a spokeswoman for Amnesty in Spain. Amnesty said the immigrants had difficulty applying for asylum and suffered poor living conditions in the Melilla centre. When it visited the Melilla centre in October, it said residents were sleeping in crammed dormitories without bedsheets, or in tents, and had to form long queues for showers and meals, it said. Spanish government officials in Melilla said that since Amnesty's visit, a new office for processing asylum claims had been opened. More than three million Syrians have fled their country in the past four years of civil war, most of them to neighbouring countries such as Turkey and Lebanon. Amnesty said in December that only about 1.7 percent of them had been resettled in rich countries."

Germany and the European commission were keen to implement a new asylum and immigration system with the aim of sharing migrants across the EU on a permanent basis and German Chancellor Angela Merkel spoke of ""sharing the burden"" during the summit.
Germany asked for a ""small reference"" of support for the measures proposed by the European Commission in September (which includes the permanent refugee settling plan) to be included in the concluding text, according to the Spanish Huffington Post.
But the idea was rejected by Spain, as well as by Hungary, Poland, Slovakia and the Czech Republic, which make up the Visegrad group, an alliance of the four central European states.
Spanish Prime Minister seemed upbeat after the summit, tweeting about the EU leaders’ plan to provide more help to Turkey to deal with the refugee crisis.

The EU struck a deal with Turkey to help stem the flow of refugees into Europe, providing a multimillion euro package to halt people smugglers and stop refugees fleeing Syria from crossing the sea to Europe.
Rajoy asked for the debate on permanent and binding quotas to be postponed to allow Spain to concentrate on the “provisional” quotas it agreed to in September, according to Europa Press.
Spain has already agreed to accept 14,931 refugees under a quota scheme devised by the EU in early September.
Around 78 percent of Spaniards are in favour of the implementation of obligatory refugee quotas according to a Eurobarometer study released on Thursday."

'Refugees welcome in Spain': So where are they?
Spain promised to up the numbers and welcome 467 refugees in March but, two weeks after the end of the month, has failed to welcome a single one, according to the latest European Commission figures, published on Tuesday.
""Spain has all the necessary conditions to increase its numbers"" but must assume ""a greater responsibility and commitment,"" said Francesca Friz-Prguda the representative for the UN’s refugee agency, the UNHCR, in Spain, who added that the Spanish government needed to make the welcome criteria for refugees more flexible.
Spain’s government had previously blamed the low refugee numbers on the ""complexity"" of coordination and acting Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy said that the EU plan was not going ""as fast as (he’d) like"".
Brussels has piled ""harsh criticism"" on the figures, and has blamed Spain’s conservative government and its “lack of willingness”, EU sources told Spanish daily El País.
The Spanish government has claimed that the UNHCR has started to process the files of refugees arriving from Turkey, Greece and Italy, but says it has not heard anything from the organization yet, while sources at the UNHCR said they received the files in mid-March and processed them immediately.
While Rajoy has blamed the slow and complex EU process, opponents have criticized his government for lack of action. In early April, Ciudadanos leader Albert Rivera said ""it’s not worth having quotas if you do not carry them through""."

Refugees ""have no right to end up in a particular country,"" Chancellor Angela Merkel told journalists after the meeting ended in the early hours of Thursday morning.
Leaders tried to find a solution that would put an end to what EU Council President Donald Tusk called ""chaos on our external frontiers"", which sees many refugees entering Europe and attempting to evade registration until they arrive in their destination country of choice – often Germany.
Instead, the EU will set up registration centres known as ""Hotspots"" in the countries where most refugees arrive on European soil for the first time.
As well as hotspots in Greece and Italy, there are plans for a third in Bulgaria, Merkel said.
European cash will also begin flowing to the front lines of the refugee crisis, with €1 billion earmarked for the UN World Food Programme (WFP) and another billion for direct aid in Turkey.
African countries in crisis will also receive €1.8 billion of emergency funds.
And the EU's border agency Frontex will be beefed up with more cash and personnel.
The total planned spending has been doubled from the amount leaders had planned for at the beginning of 2015, to €9.2 billion.
How do you solve a problem like Orban?
But the moves were not enough for some leaders, including Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who threatened to close his country's border with fellow EU member Croatia.
Orban argues that the EU has failed to collectively secure its borders and that refugees are breaking international rules.
And he made a further stab at critics of a recently-completed fence on Hungary's border with Serbia, saying that ""if you don't like the fence, then we can also let refugees through on their way to Austria and Germany.""
Tusk acknowledged that ""as you can imagine, discussions between the Hungarian Prime Minister and the Austrian Chancellor [Werner Faymann] were very energetic"" behind the scenes.
Faymann has accused Hungary of already ignoring the EU's so-called ""Dublin"" rules to allow refugees through to Austria without first registering them.
""There are points of agreement, but also many different analyses,"" Merkel said of the EU's relationship to Orban – who was invited to Munich by her Bavarian allies on Tuesday in a deliberate prod at the Chancellor.
""Where we agree is that we're completely unified on the fact that the defence of the external borders is necessary,"" she continued.
EU leaders will meet again for a scheduled summit in three weeks' time and continue their discussions.
No let-up for Merkel
Merkel will have little time to recover from the hours of Brussels talks, as she heads into a fresh summit in Berlin with the leaders of Germany's federal states.
The minister-presidents want to squeeze billions more in cash out of the federal government to help them cope with the 500,000 refugees who have arrived in Germany so far this year.
""We need a sustainable system of financing that measures up to the number of people who are coming to us,"" Schleswig-Holstein leader Torsten Albig said.
Meanwhile, Rhineland-Palatinate minister-president Malu Dreyer said that ""the most important part for me is that asylum processing be speeded up.""
The federal and state governments are expected to thrash out a comprehensive refugee deal at Thursday's meeting covering how costs are shared.
The €3 billion of federal money promised to the states for refugee support in 2016 already looks insufficient as the numbers arriving continue to rise.
Dreyer said that she was hoping the cash injection would be increased to five billion Euros, while Brandenburg minister-president Dietmar Woidke pushes for six.
Hoped-for changes in the law will include designating Albania, Kosovo and Montenegro as ""safe countries of origin"" from where no asylum applications will be granted.
Refugees may also be held in government accommodation for longer and supported with more in-kind benefits rather than cash.
And the recently-appointed head of the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF) will present his plan to deal with the 275,000-person backlog in asylum applications that saw his predecessor step down."

The ruins of the camp. Photo: AFP
It was constructed specifically to house the influx of Spanish refugees: men, women and children who were fleeing their homeland at the end of the Spanish Civil War.
More than 21,000 Spanish refugees fled to France and were housed in the camp, 30km from the Spanish border.
During the Second World War, the camp was used to hold Jews and gypsies, alongside those who had fled Franco's Spain. Estimates put the number of republicans sent to Nazi concentration camps from Rivesaltes at around 8,000.
The camp's dark history continued through the 1950s and 1960s when it was used to detain harkis - the Algerian soldiers serving in the French army, during the Algerian war.
More recently, it served as a detention centre for people who had made their way illegally into France, and only closed its doors for good in 2007.
French Prime Minister Manuel Valls, himself the grandson of the editor of a Republican newspaper during the Civil War, officially inaugerated the memorial museum on Friday.

One of the few Spanish detainees still alive today is Gilbert Susagna, 80, who lives in Perpignan. He was interned in the camp in 1941 with his mother.
His father was a communist and lost a lung in the Siege of Madrid before he fled to France in 1939.
""The Jews and the gypsies had a terrible time my mother told me,"" Susagna told El País, ""I was little so it wasn’t as bad, but it is something that has marked my life.""
Susagna had planned to attend the official opening on Friday.

Around half of the 21,000 Spaniards who were interned in the camp were sent to concentration camps, usually Mauthausen in Austria, where 65 percent of them died.
In 1942, one of the darkest periods in the camp’s history, 2,251 Jews, including 110 children, were transferred from Rivesaltes via Drancy to Auschwitz, where they were killed.
""There is an important part of Spain’s history in the camp,"" Denis Peschanski, the son of one of the camp’s inmates from the Republican brigades, and the current president of the Scientific Committee of the Memorial of Rivesaltes told El País.
There have been many attempts to destroy evidence relating to the camp; in 1998 thousands of files relating to Rivesaltes were discovered in a skip.

One man who fought for the memorial is Socialist mayor of Argeles-sur-Mer Pierre Aylagas, himself the son of a Republican Spanish farmer who was interned in the camp.

""If these extraordinarily powerful images of a dead Syrian child washed up on a beach don't change Europe's attitude to refugees, what will?"" Britain's Independent said in remarks echoed in newspapers across the continent.
On Wednesday, the UN Security Council said it was discussing a draft resolution to address the crisis that diplomats said may allow an EU naval force to seize ships operated by migrant smugglers in international waters.
More than 350,000 people have made the perilous journey from North Africa to Europe this year, many trafficked by people smugglers from war-torn Libya, where nearly 3,000 migrants were rescued on Wednesday close to the coast.
Calls for change
France, Italy and Germany, meanwhile, urged a rethink of European asylum rules to ensure ""a fair distribution"" of migrants throughout the 28-member bloc, as tensions soared between European states over how to tackle the huge influx.
Spain has rejected the EU commission quota plan and said it will accept only 2,749 of the 5,849 refugees it was asked to rehome.
But Spanish Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Garcia-Margallo told Germany daily newspaper Die Welt on Wednesday that Spain has ""been ready from the start to welcome as many people as possible"" but called for a ""fair"" distribution of refugees among member states.
In Britain, where Prime Minister David Cameron's government has accepted a lower number of asylum seekers in proportion to its population than most other EU countries, tens of thousands of people signed petitions demanding change.
By late Wednesday, some 46,600 people had signed a petition urging the government to accept more asylum seekers, the number doubling in a few hours. Another garnered 135,000 signatures in four days, while a third raised more than 13,000 supporters.
The government is obliged to respond if a petition has more than 10,000 signatures, and if it reaches 100,000, the issue will be considered for debate in parliament.
The escalating migrant crisis has exposed deep divisions in the EU's policy, sparking friction between transit nations where the migrants arrive by sea or land and those where they hope to seek asylum, mainly in northern and western Europe.
In Hungary, which has been on the frontline of the huge wave of new arrivals, scuffles broke out between police and swelling crowds of migrants, numbering some 2,000, who had been prevented from boarding trains at Budapest's main international station.
""No police! No police!"" and ""Germany! Germany!"" they chanted, some running forward and hurling plastic bottles as riot police pushed them back.
There have been several tense encounters between the crowds and police following Hungary's decision to prevent migrants travelling west on Tuesday, after several thousand boarded trains bound for Austria and Germany the previous day.
'Europe's paltry response'
The situation is also becoming increasingly desperate on Europe's sea borders after a dramatic spike in the numbers of migrants leaving Turkey by sea for Greece over the past week, among them the tiny toddler whose death has caused such outrage.
A rescue worker from Bodrum identified the boy as Aylan Kurdi to AFP. Media reports said he was three years old.
Aylan was believed to be travelling with his family on a tiny boat built for four people but which was carrying 15 refugees, believed to be from the Syrian Kurdish town of Kobane, who fled to Turkey last year to escape Islamic State extremists.
The toddler was one of at least 12 Syrian migrants who died, five of whom were children, including five-year-old brother Galip. Another 15 people were rescued.
The boat sank around 4:00 am (0100 GMT), close to the lighthouse in the Akyarlar region,"" the rescue worker said, suggesting the boats had capsized.
""Most probably they were panicked and many didn't know how to swim.""
The Syrians ""almost certainly died as they tried to reach safety in Europe by boarding a smuggler's boat,"" said Peter Bouckaert, Human Rights Watch's director of emergencies.
""Instead they ended up as the latest victims of Europe's paltry response in the face of a growing crisis,"" he wrote in an acerbic article."

The group, who said they were Kurds from Iran, were stunned to discover that they had arrived in Spain.

The monument consists of a large metal rectangular pillar that comes decked out with a digital counter above the inscription ""This isn't just a number, these are people.""

The fatality rate this year is higher than in the same period in 2015, the IOM said this week.
One reason for the higher death toll this year is that there have been a series of shipwrecks involving larger vessels carrying several hundred people rather than the more typical dinghies that carry a maximum of 100 migrants.
Syrians fleeing the country's brutal war again made up the largest group to have risked their lives to make the dangerous sea crossing so far this year.

The Council of Ministers is meeting on Friday to approve the criteria for distributing €1.75 million to the country's autonomous communities for helping refugees.
Since the EU agreed on a plan to share in the responsibility of caring for refugees under a redistribution and quota system, the Spanish government has been criticized for dragging its feet in meeting its promises.
The UN refugee agency said in April that Spain needed to take a “greater responsibility” after its government had agreed to take in some 15,000 refugees from overwhelmed Greece and Italy: In the first six months after the agreement, Spain took in just 18 people.
More recently the government has tried to speed up the process, pledging that it would be able to bring in 586 refugees by the end of June. But according to Europa Press, the country has taken in just 305.
Meanwhile the Spanish public has tried to put pressure on the government to do more. And a survey in May found that Spaniards were among the most accepting of refugees worldwide with a high of 97 percent of Spanish respondents saying that they would ""personally accept people fleeing war or persecution"" into their country, according to Amnesty International.
A report in June revealed that there are actually more asylum seekers in Spain from Venezuela than from Syria."

Spanish acting Foreign Affairs Minister José Manuel García-Margallo announced on Wednesday that his ministry has started the process to bring seven-year-old Afghan refugee Osman to Spain from Greece.
""I gave instructions as soon as I found out to the Embassy of Spain in Athens to bring Osman here as soon as possible,"" the minister said in a statement posted on Twitter.
""We are all devoted to this.""
#GarcíaMargallo: yo di instrucciones en cuanto me enteré a la @EmbEspAtenas, de que se pusiesen en marcha para traer a #Osman cuanto antes.

Osman suffers from the movement disorder cerebral palsy and is currently living in the crowded camps of Idomeni, Greece at the closed Macedonian border where thousands of refugees are stranded, hoping to proceed on what was a main migration path through Europe.
García-Margallo said that the little boy and his family would be taken to a hospital in Valencia where Osman can receive proper treatment.
Osman's story started gaining attention across the country when the NGO Firefighters in Action (Bomberos en Acción) started an online petition, raising more than 150,000 signatures in support of bringing him to Spain.
""The number of people who showed their interest in Osman is good news because it shows that our country is in solidarity, and believes this is worthwhile,"" García-Margallo said.
Osman along with his parents and two siblings, ages nine and eight, fled Afghanistan in March and ""after a harrowing journey on land and sea,"" arrived at the Greek camp, according to Firefighters in Action.
Osman suffers from recurring seizures, spasticity (tightness of the muscles), respiratory problems and malnutrition, according to the firefighter group.
""In one month, he lost four kilos (now weighing eight kilos at 90cm tall,"" the group wrote in the petition, adding that he is only eating small amounts of cereal and milk so as not to risk choking.
To bring the family to Spain, the Foreign Ministry must still clarify whether the family first applied for asylum in Greece, and then how it would be possible to bring them to Spain, according to Europa Press.
But once the necessary paperwork has been sorted, Osman could even travel to Spain within the next week, though nothing is yet certain, Europa Press reported.
""This is one of the things that make it worthwhile being Foreign Minister,"" García-Margallo told Spanish media. ""To be able to alleviate the pain of refugees - even by a little bit - is huge, especially for a child at this age.""
But as much as Osman's story has melted hearts across the country, Spain has also come under harsh criticism from the EU and UN for not taking in enough refugees. Spain agreed last September to take in some 15,000 refugees from overwhelmed Greece and Italy, but since then has only taken in 18.
Critics have blamed conservative leaders including acting Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy for dragging their feet on the matter."

""£60 million of this additional funding will go to help Syrians still in Syria. The rest will go to neighboring countries, to Turkey, Jordan and Lebanon, where Syrian refugees now account for one quarter of the population.""
Both leaders said they had shared views on tackling the issues connected with migration and said clear distinctions should be made between those fleeing conflict zones and those seeking a brighter economic future.
""We will continue our approach of taking them direct from Syrian refugee camps,"" Cameron said, adding that the government would announce more details next week.
""Britain's aid is supporting these camps. If we were not doing that, the numbers attempting the dangerous journey to Europe would be far, far higher.""
Mr Cameron said the UK would also carry on supporting efforts to detect and disrupt people-smuggling gangs and continue search and rescue operations to save migrants in the Mediterranean which have already assisted more than 6,700 people.
""Britain will act with her head and her heart,"" said the British leader. ""For those economic migrants seeking a better life, we will continue to work to break the link between getting on a boat and getting settlement in Europe, discouraging those who don't have a genuine claim from embarking on these perilous and sometimes lethal journeys.
""For those genuine refugees fleeing civil war, we will act with compassion and continue to provide sanctuary.""
""I want to send the message out that the best way to get a new life is not to make this perilous journey,"" he said.
Cameron failed to mention any plans to accept those already within Europe’s borders.
Rajoy agreed that the refugee crisis was ""the most important challenge facing the EU” but likewise insisted that efforts be made to crackdown on the “people trafficking mafias” responsible for transporting desperate souls across the sea into Europe.
The UN's top envoy for refugees on Friday said EU nations must develop a common strategy to resettle up to 200,000 refugees who have already made it to Europe, adding that ""no country can refuse to do its part.""
Cameron defended his government's record on Friday, saying Britain had already provided more than 900 million pounds in aid to ""help those affected in Syria and the region.""
""No European country has done more than Britain in this regard,"" he said.
""Were it not for that massive aid, the numbers making the perilous journey to Europe today would be even higher,"" Cameron said.

Meanwhile Spain has rejected the EU commission quota plan and said it will accept only 2,749 of the 5,849 refugees it was asked to re-home.
On Friday, Rajoy insisted that Spain was pulling its weight. “Asylum requests this year are triple then they were last year,” he said adding that the quota issue will be reassessed later this month.
“Spain is constantly giving asylum to people...and we are going to meet our commitments,” he added.
He said that he had established an interministerial committee to address the issue of how Spain can best shoulder its responsibility to migrants.
Seven ministers from different departments will hold their first meeting on Monday, he said.

The arrival of the three ships transporting the group of rescued migrants will be staggered so there is time to assess and process each of those on board, explained Carmen Calvo, the deputy PM on Thursday.
After meeting with Ximo Puig, the regional president of Valencia to coordinate the arrival, she said that the migrants would be dealt with in a specific area of the cruise terminal at the port in Valencia and that each of the 629 migrants would be dealt be given “personalized attention”.
“Some will then be taken directly to migrant detention centres (CIE) and other to humanitarian aid centres depending on their condition,” she said, adding that the priority was to address the humanitarian crisis and then deal with the legal status of each migrant.
“We are worried about the unaccompanied children, and the people who have been victims of some sort of crime. Such as those who have been trafficked with the purpose of sexual exploitation,” she said.
Those who need medical treatment will be transferred to hospitals where spaces have been allocated.
Migrants or refugees?
Anyone stepping foot on Spanish soil has the legal right to request asylum, so those rescued by the Aquarius may indeed request protection claiming fear of persecution in their own countries.
Those who come from countries such as Congo, South Sudan, Eritrea, Somalia, Adghanistan or Syria have a legitimate claim and will likely be allowed to process an asylum claim.
However, for those from countries such as Morocco, Senegal, Ghana or Algeria, an asylum claim is more complicated.
Just like any other arrivals

Interior Minister Fernando Grande-Marlaska said during an interview with radio Cope on Thursday that these migrants would be treated ""in the same way"" as the more than 9,000 migrants who have reached Spain by sea so far this year.
""It will be decided if a person should receive protection or not"" by distinguishing between those who have endured ""all sorts of calamities"" to qualify for asylum, and those who come for ""economic reasons"", the minister said.
Arrivals by sea double
Since the start of the year, over 9,300 migrants reached Spain's shores by sea, more than double the figure for the same period last year, according to the International Organisation for Migration (IOM).
The number of migrants who died while trying to reach Spain by sea has more than quadrupled to 244 as of June 10th from 61 last year during the same period.
Most migrants travel in packed boats from Morocco's northern shore to Spain's southern coast, a distance of over 100 kilometres (60 miles) depending on the route.
Spain was the third most popular destination for migrants in the European Union last year after Italy and Greece.
What happens after they arrive?
After passing through a police station to be identified, migrants are usually taken to one of seven longer-term immigration detention centres where they wait for up to 60 days for their fate to be decided.
Some 8,800 people passed through these centres last year, according to official figures. Human rights Watch and other rights groups complain that migrants are held in poor conditions in these centres and face obstacles in applying for asylum.
""A lot of people are released into the streets after 72 hours (at a police station), because currently there are no more places in the centres,"" Carlos Arce, migration coordinator at the Human Rights Association of Andalusia (APDHA), told AFP.
These migrants are left to fend for themselves, without any follow-up or help from the government, he added.
For those who manage to formally seek asylum, the system is saturated.
Is there a 'siren call' risk?

The government's decision to take in the migrants from the Aquarius, operated by SOS Mediterranee, has been generally well received in Spain, with dozens of cities and regions offering to give them shelter.
But the conservative Popular Party which ran Spain for six years, until they were ousted in a no-confidence vote on June 1st, quickly sounded the alarm that the move would act as a ""siren call"" for more migrants.
While the number of migrants arriving in Spain by sea has doubled, in Italy arrivals by sea have dropped by 73 percent over the same period last year to 14,330 as of June 10, according to IOM figures.
Change in policy?
Sanchez cited ""humanitarian reasons"" for agreeing to accept the migrants from the Aquarius ship. The gesture contrasted with the policy under his conservative predecessor Mariano Rajoy whose government was often accused of only reluctantly accepting migrants.
""Spain is far from respecting the quota of migrants that has been assigned each country"" by the European Commission, Spanish foreign Minister Josep Borrell said Wednesday.
The country pledged to receive 9,323 refugees who arrived in Greece and Italy but as of May 31st it had only welcomed 1,359, according to the Commission.

In ministerial-level talks, they agreed to ""attack underlying causes of irregular migration,"" according to a joint statement.
""The economic problem... is also the basis for the migration phenomenon,"" Niger Interior Minister Mohamed Bazoum said.
The countries also vowed to strengthen national laws to prosecute traffickers and improve coordination among police and judiciary in fighting human smuggling.
The one-day ""conference on coordination of the struggle against traffickers of migrants"" took place against a backdrop of renewed concern in Europe over illicit migration, three years after a massive human influx led to a rise in xenophobia and far-right populism in several EU states.
It was attended by ministers from Burkina Faso, Chad, Guinea, Ivory Coast, Libya, Mali, Mauritania, Niger and Senegal, with representatives from France, Germany, Italy and Spain, the European Union and United Nations.
The communique called for ""developing the conditions for an economy to emerge that is an alternative to the underground economy of illicit trafficking of migrants."" To achieve this requires ""an overall approach, with solidarity,"" it said.
Reflecting the issue's priority, France sent two senior ministers -- Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian and Interior Minister Gerard Collomb, who urged participants to take action ""as close as possible to the countries of origin.""
Niger, one of the large nations lying south of the Sahara in West Africa, has become one of the main routes for African migrants heading north to the Mediterranean coast in the hope of crossing to Europe.
Collomb said because of a series of preventive measures taken by Niger, the number of Europe-bound migrants passing through the country had ""dropped drastically"" from 330,000 in 2016 to 70,000 last year.
""If all the countries put such measures in place we can reduce the number of arrivals in Europe,"" he said.
Two Africa-EU summits in 2017 put the focus on training police and paramilitary gendarmerie forces, help with conducting border checks and the creation of identity databases.
Europe's part in taking on irregular migration in Africa gained force with ""migratory pacts"" signed in 2015 in Valetta, capital of Malta, which built on previous accords to reach a global approach dating back to 2006.
One of the challenges, in the eyes of French delegates, is to persuade African countries to agree more readily to provide documents enabling the return of their nationals who lack the required papers.
The French parliament is due in coming months to debate a government bill on immigration, which has already made waves among some supporters of the government who consider the new measure too severe."

Pascal Brice, director-general of France's refugee protection office Ofpra, told AFP that one of his teams would travel to Valencia soon.
""As soon as the Spanish authorities have informed us of the number of people concerned, a team from Ofpra will go on site to conduct the interviews and ensure that people are covered by the right to asylum,"" he said, adding that the process should take place this week.
The majority of the 630 migrants are from Africa, including 450 men and 80 women, of which at least seven are pregnant, as well as 89 adolescents and 11 children under the age of 13, according to the Valencian authorities.
The Aquarius rescued them off Libya's coast on June 9th and Italy and Malta's refusal to let the ship dock led to an international outcry before Spain stepped in to help.

""The city is ready at the technical level, all our services are ready and residents are waiting with open arms. But they don't arrive.""
While EU interior ministers gathered in Brussels this week to try to hammer out a unified response to the biggest migration crisis in the bloc's history, the city detailed its own ""Barcelona Refuge City"" plan.
When Colau announced the initiative in August, hundreds of residents of the Mediterranean, seaside city flooded the city hall with e-mails volunteering to help.
The plan was quickly followed by other cities across the country including Madrid, the Mediterranean port of Valencia and Cadiz in the southwest.
It had initially agreed to accept just 2,749.
""But since then, just 18 have arrived (in the whole of Spain), a ridiculous figure,"" said Pascale Coissard, spokeswoman in the northeastern region of Catalonia for the country's Commission for Refugee Aid.
The agency has for months prepared to receive a chunk of the over one million people who have arrived in Europe fleeing from Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan or Eritrea.
It boosted the number of places able to welcome refugees in Catalonia -- the capital of which is Barcelona -- to 41 from ten and will shortly open 50 more.
The agency has also reinforced its medical and psychological services and it is training municipalities in the region how best to deal with newly arrived refugees.

""We are ready,"" said Oscar Barbero, head of social services for the local branch of the Red Cross.
""But we are working blindly, without knowing when they will arrive, how they will arrive or how many will arrive.""
The main problem is that Spain's central government ""is not providing any information,"" said Ignasi Calbo, coordinator of the ""Barcelona Refuge City"" plan, for which 10.5 million euros ($11.6 million) has been set aside.
And Brussels and European nations are also dragging their feet.
In late September, European leaders agreed on a plan to relocate 160,000 migrants from the countries they're flooding into -- mainly Greece and Italy.
But it has so far relocated just 600 -- an unacceptable situation for Colau.

""And while it does not, it will be an accomplice to these human trafficking mafias and boat sinkings.""

As a result, Barcelona wants European cities to grab hold of the issue.
For the past few months, it has been working with associations representing European cities, such as Eurocities or Metropolis, to pressure European institutions to act.
Now they will move to direct action, said Colau.
Barcelona city hall is finalising cooperation agreements with municipalities which have been overwhelmed by the arrivals of migrants, such as Athens and Lesbos in Greece or Lampedusa in Italy.

Spain has been asked to accept 15,000 refugees, over 12 percent of the 120,000 people who have made the treacherous journey to Europe and are now waiting to be rehomed in nations across Europe.
Spain has so far rejected the terms of an EU quota and said it will take in only 2,749 refugees of the 5,849 demanded of the European Commission.

However, Spain has thawed in its stance towards refugee numbers since Prime Minister Rajoy’s visit to Germany last week to meet with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, as well as his meeting on Friday with British Prime Minister David Cameron, and the country is expected to agree to take more refugees following the worsening crisis.
The exact number is expected to be decided during Monday’s first meeting of the Spanish government’s inter-ministerial committee on the refugee crisis - which is made up of seven ministries and presided over by vice-president Soraya Sáenz de Santamaría.
Spain has seen the number of asylum requests skyrocket over the past few years from 2,588 in 2012 to 5,952 in 2014. Spain’s Interior Minister, Jorge Fernández, said on Friday that Spain was expecting “more than 17,000 requests for asylum in 2015. Around 3,500 of these were made within Melilla, Spain's north African city enclave bordering Morocco.
As the Spanish government aims to limit the number of refugees arriving in the country, Spaniards themselves have been mobilizing to help, with over 12 Spanish cities setting up a network of places where locals can sign up to welcome refugees into their homes."

A Spanish coast guard vessel intercepted on Saturday a boat packed with 13 Moroccan migrants, including four minors, about 10 nautical miles (18.5 kilometres) off the coast of the southern province of Granada. The migrants, all of them male, were taken to a local detention centre which has seen its numbers swell since the end of August due to a wave of arrivals of boats from Morocco carrying people seeking a better life in Europe. Last month a man was found dead clinging to a flimsy vessel adrift at sea off the Spanish exclave of Ceuta which borders Morocco, and a dozen more migrants were missing and feared dead, after their boat capsized during an attempt to reach Spanish soil. Eleven African migrants, including three women and two children, died in April when their wooden boat capsized off the Spanish coast. The drama faced by migrants trying to sail to Europe's shores has been pushed to the top of the political agenda after a boat carrying between 450 and 500 African asylum-seekers — mostly Somalis and Eritreans — capsized on Thursday off the remote Italian island of Lampedusa. French Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault called Saturday for a meeting of European countries on border management in the wake of the disaster in which hundreds are feared dead. The Spanish government has warned that fighting in the Sahel region of northern Africa and the unrest sparked by the Arab spring uprising has increased the flow of migrants. The numbers of migrants who have attempted to reach Spain's southern shores from Morocco by boat has increased since August, due in part according to Spanish authorities to the end of the Islamic holy month of Ramadan. ""This year the region that has had the greatest number of rescues is Tarifa,"" said Carmen Lorente of Spain's maritime rescue service. Tarifa is located only 15km (nine miles) from Morocco across the Strait of Gibraltar. It has become one of the key smuggling routes for illegal migrants crossing into Europe after Spanish authorities a decade ago cracked down on migrants heading to Spain's Canary Islands in the Atlantic off the coast of Morocco. Authorities estimate thousands of illegal migrants from Africa regularly attempt to cross from Morocco into Spain on makeshift boats each year. Some travel thousands of miles overland, being handed from smuggler to smuggler, ending up at one of many ports in northern Africa for a cramped and treacherous sea crossing to European soil. Overall the number of migrants who have been rescued at sea while trying to enter Spain is down in 2013 over last year despite the rise in attempted crossing in recent weeks. Spain's maritime rescue services have picked up 1,396 migrants from boats off the coast of Spain between January 1 and September 16, compared to 1,709 during the same period last year, Lorente said. But the number of rescue operations has risen this year since migrants are making the perilous trip in smaller boats, often in inflatable dinghies that carry fewer people, she added. Thousands of migrants also try to enter Spanish soil overland by scaling the border fences that surround Ceuta and Melilla, two Spanish exclaves surrounded by Morocco that have the European Union's only land borders with Africa. The most spectacular recent attempt took place on September 17th when about 300 migrants tore down part of the three rows of six-metre-high (20 foot-high) fencing that surrounds Melilla and about 150 made it through. Police video images showed dozens of migrants scrambling over the fence and starting to run as soon as they hit Spanish soil. Six Spanish police officers and one immigrant were injured in that border assault."

“More than six months after the deadline expired, a report by (Spain’s) Office for asylum and refugees recognises that the current track record with respect to its final obligations is below 13 percent,” the court said in a ruling dated July 9 but released on Wednesday.
As a result, Spain must “continue the procedure” to take in refugees, the court added, but stopped short of fining the government.
In September 2015, at the height of the migrant crisis in Europe, EU member states reached a deal to share out 160,000 asylum-seekers who had arrived in Italy and Greece within two years, to ease the pressure on both countries.
Spain had pledged to take in at least 16,000 migrants.
Like Spain, most countries have not met their commitment and many migrants have left Italy and Greece of their own volition rather than wait to be transferred.
Since then, more and more migrants crossing the Mediterranean have chosen to head for Spain rather than Italy or Greece.
With 15,426 arrivals so far this year, according to the International Organization for Migration, Spain has already overtaken Greece and is set to catch up with Italy.

					18:12 CET+01:00				",Emma Anderson ,Surge in Ukrainian asylum seekers to Spain,"Spain saw a huge spike in Ukrainians applying for asylum in 2014, according to data released by Eurostat last week and analyzed by The Local.
Spain saw one of the most dramatic increases in Ukrainian asylum seekers in 2014 with just 15 applying in 2013 compared to 895 people in 2014, or 60 times that of 2013.
In fact Ukrainians made up the second largest group of asylum seekers in Spain, after the 1,510 Syrian applicants.
UN report surge in worldwide refugees driven by Syria and Iraq conflicts.
However, Spain rejected 80 Ukrainians in their first asylum application attempts, and by the end of 2014 had not accepted any applicants, according to the Eurostat data.
Overall, the number of Ukrainian asylum seekers in the 28 EU member states ballooned to 14,040 people in 2014 - more than 13 times higher than the number in 2013 at 1,060 applicants.
That number is even greater when compared to 2008, the beginning of the global economic crisis, when 925 Ukrainians applied for asylum.
""What we have seen from our members working with asylum seekers are those who are fleeing the conflict in the east of Ukraine,"" Julia Zelvenska, a senior legal officer at the European Council on Refugees and Exiles, told The Local. ""In the past, it has been for political persecution, like in 2013, or for sexual orientation.""
The UN refugee agency UNHCR said last month that an estimated one million Ukrainians were displaced internally, with many people moving west. Some 600,000 people had sought asylum, many of them in non-EU countries such as Russia, Belarus and Moldova.
But many Ukrainians also applied for asylum in the European Union in 2014, a year that started with a revolution in Kiev and the ousting of the pro-Russian president, Viktor Yanukovych.
Russia then annexed Crimea in March, in a move widely condemned around the world, before propping up separatists fighting bloody battles with Ukrainian forces in the east of the country.
Of those who applied for asylum in 2014, only 650 Ukrainians received positive outcomes on their first application decision in the EU. Eurostat defines positive outcomes as grants of refugee or subsidiary protection status, or an authorisation to stay for humanitarian reasons.
Still, those who received good news were greatly outnumbered by those who were rejected in their first try - 2,335.
The stats show that Germany was the EU nation that received the highest number of Ukrainian asylum requests at 2,705 - 18 times greater than the 150 who applied in 2013.
Zelvenska explained to The Local that it is generally very hard for Ukrainians to gain asylum in EU member states, or to even reach those countries in the first place.
""One of the main reasons people get rejected may be that many countries are not clear on how the situation developed and won’t issue decisions until it is clear how the Ukrainian situation is going to develop,"" she said.
""European countries are also being very formalistic in the criteria for asylum,"" Zelvenska added. ""For example, they may say that there are options for alternative protection already within Ukraine. For people in the east, they may say that they could relocate to the west.""
Zelvenska noted though that reasons for rejection are not made public so it is difficult to know for certain.
""We think it’s not necessary to apply all the criteria in a strict manner,"" she said. ""They must consider each case, country and the circumstances.""
Last year, EU countries received the highest number of asylum seekers since 1992 with a total of 626,000 applicants. More than 400,000 people applied in 2013.
But it appeared that the rate of Ukrainians applying for asylum had slowed since the start of 2015.
""Recent number of asylum applications by Ukrainian asylum seekers in Europe indeed increased in 2014, but have so far been decreasing in 2015,"" Zelvenska said. ""In general, the numbers still remain quite low, for example, in February 2015 only 125 Ukrainians applied for asylum in Europe.""
She explained that ""it can be assumed that the reason for displacement was lined to the armed conflict in the country and related serious harm or persecution.
""I would like to stress again that Ukrainian asylum seekers as well as asylum seekers of other nationalities experience a number of problems when trying to reach Europe, in fact opportunities for safe and regular ways of accessing Europe are almost non-existent and even refugees are not exempt of general visa requirements.""
Most of those Ukranians applying for asylum chose to do so in a country that they already had some link to.
""Many Ukrainian nationals, who applied for asylum in [Germany, Spain, Italy, France or Sweden], were those, who were already in a European country, for example, working or studying (sur place protection seekers), when the situation in Ukraine had changed.
""Asylum applicants choose specific countries usually because they either have friends or family in this particular country, could rely on the support from the community, sometimes speak the language or might have other ties with this country,"" the senior legal officer at the European Council on Refugees and Exiles said."

Eight years ago he arrived in Spain with nothing. But on Tuesday, Ngame cried with joy as he realized all his dreams had come true with the purchase of lottery ticket.
He was one of thousands who bought a ticket with the number 79140 from a lottery shop in the Andalusian seaside town of Roquetas de Mar.
The number won the top prize of El Gordo – the 'fat one' – in Tuesday's draw, netting the town of 90,000 people a change in fortune.

He later described how hard life had been since leaving his home in Senegal in 2007.
""There were 65 of us in the patera,"" he told La Voz de Almeria, describing the stricken wooden boat in which he had travelled with the woman who is now his wife.
Since arriving in Spain, the pair have tried to survive on temporary agricultural work as vegetable pickers in the greenhouses that cover much of that corner of Almeria.
""I just can't believe this,"" he said gripping his winning numbers. "" I can say that sometimes we haven't had five euros between us a day…""
Ngame also chose to remember his last employer in the greenhouses, who recently laid him off.
""This is a souvenir to Antonio, who told left us to fend for ourselves,"" he quipped.

The winning number appeared on 1,600 'décimo' tickets sold exclusively from the lottery shop located at number 19 on Avenida de Roquetas.
Some 85 percent of the tickets were sold with each décimo - the €20 share of a tenth of a full ticket - winning the top prize of €400,000 before tax.

The school in Laujar de Andarax ended up selling 800 tickets to friends and family winning a total of more than €300 million.
""Nearly everyone here has a ticket or a share in one,"" the town's mayor, Almudena Morales, told the news agency Europa Press.
""People are going crazy, nobody can believe it. The money went to down-to-earth people who work hard and who really needed it.""
One couple from Aragon had bought the winning lottery ticket while on a recent holiday to the seaside town. As well as buying one décimo each, they bought seven others for friends and family, earning the group a combined €3.6 million.
While José Martín, (pictured below) the vendor of the winning ticket, has become a local hero, he admitted that ""sadly"" he had failed to buy any of his own stock.

Minister Matteo Salvini targeted Spain with a criticism he had earlier levelled at France, alleging the countries had received only a fraction of the migrants they had agreed to take under a European Union deal.
Spain ""can therefore receive the next four boats"" of migrants rescued in the Mediterranean, Salvini told a press conference.
Salvini drew criticism from France last week for refusing to open Italy's ports to the Aquarius, a rescue ship carrying 630 migrants. Spain stepped in to receive them instead.

Austria's conservative and rightwing coalition government is also taking ahard line against migrants. The country takes over the rotating EU presidency on July 1st.
Salvini took office last month in a populist government formed following elections marked by the migration issue.
Italy is one of the main entry points for thousands of migrants crossing the Mediterranean from North Africa.
Salvini called for more help from other EU countries to deal with them.
""We ask Europe to provide more men and resources to defend the Mediterranean,"" he said.

""A preliminary investigation has been opened,"" a coastguard spokeswoman said, adding that the suspects were likely to be charged with ""attempting to facilitate the entry of illegal migrants.""
Another coastguard source identified the suspects as Spanish.
The five suspects claim to be working for Basque lifeguard group DYA, one of dozens of non-government aid groups helping thousands of refugees and migrants arriving from the neighbouring Turkish coast on a weekly basis.
Two of the suspects were arrested on Wednesday on board a speedboat where coastguards found an unregistered wireless radio which could be used to tap into official frequencies.
Greek authorities have in recent days begun a more stringent inspection of the aid groups, which until now had been given free rein to operate on the island, often leading to rescue coordination problems.
Another seven volunteers - including three Britons, two Americans, a Dane and a Cypriot - had been arrested Saturday on suspicion of stealing lifejackets left behind by refugees.
They were later released after convincing the authorities that they intended to use the lifejackets for makeshift bedding for the refugees.

""The nearest port is Malta, the organisation and flag are Spanish: they can forget about coming to an Italian port,"" he added.
Malta's interior minister retorted on Twitter that the migrants had been rescued between Libya and Italy's Lampedusa.

In the end, the NGO said they had been given authorisation to dock in Barcelona, adding they would arrive on Wednesday.
Italy's new populist government and Malta earlier this month refused to let dock French NGO rescue ship Aquarius carrying 630 migrants. The move triggered an international outcry before Spain stepped in to help.
Malta then let another charity rescue boat, Lifeline, dock with 230 migrants aboard.
Proactiva Open Arms also accused coastguards in the area of hindering their work as countries such as Italy take a hardline stance against the arrival of migrants.
The NGO said Friday's shipwreck could potentially have been avoided as the official call for help from Italy's rescue control centre only came one hour after Open Arms overheard an EU plane warning Libyan coastguards that a migrant boat was in trouble."

					09:30 CEST+02:00				",AFP,"Energy, EU, migration on the agenda as Macron heads to Spain","France's Emmanuel Macron makes his first visit as president to Spain on Thursday, in his push to overhaul the EU.
Macron will meet first with Spain's new Socialist Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez, who travelled to Paris soon after coming to power in June.
The visit was seen as a sign of Sanchez's intention to play a bigger role in European affairs compared with his predecessor Mariano Rajoy.
A source in Macron's office hailed Sanchez's desire to ""be more involved in European matters,"" at a time when Paris faces resistance to its EU reform blueprint from other countries, not least Germany.
The two men, both ambitious leaders in their 40s, ""have a very close relationship,"" the source said, adding there was ""nearly total convergence"" on their goals for the eurozone.
In particular, Macron is trying to win support for a eurozone budget, which he sees as a symbolic step towards closer European integration.
Spain and Portugal have first-hand experience of such solidarity, having both received multi-billion-euro rescue packages in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis.
Madrid and Paris are also broadly aligned on how to handle the thousands of migrants crossing the Mediterranean to Europe, an influx that has bolstered populist parties.
Both countries support the creation of ""disembarkation platforms"" outside the bloc to process refugee applications.
Spain has seen a surge in migrant arrivals in recent weeks as Italy's populist government vowed to stop letting rescue ships dock, sparking an EU crisis that was barely papered over by an accord reached in June.
More than 18,000 migrants have reached Spanish shores so far this year - more than Italy, and nearly three times the number in the same period last year.

Energy 'island'
Macron will attend a state dinner hosted by King Felipe before heading Friday to Lisbon for lunch with Prime Minister Antonio Costa and an EU summit on improving the Iberian Peninsula's energy links with the rest of Europe.
While lacking in oil and gas, Portugal and Spain have raced ahead with developing renewable energy sources like wind and solar power, and hope to sell their surplus electricity beyond the Pyrenees.
""We are expecting concrete projects from this summit so that the Iberian Peninsula will no longer be a sort of island in Europe in energy terms,"" said Portuguese foreign minister Augusto Santos Silva.
But officials in Macron's office speak only of increasing electricity links, whereas Madrid and Lisbon want to link up gas pipelines as well.
The summit is set to confirm the Bay of Biscay project, which will stretch a high-voltage underwater cable 370 kilometres (230 miles) from Spain's northern coast to southwest France.

The link will nearly double the interconnection capacity between the two countries to 5,000 megawatts, and will see the EU contribute a record €578 million ($675 million) for the project.
For natural gas, Madrid is hoping to become a strategic source for Europe by pushing a pipeline project called MidCat that would link Catalonia to France, allowing it to send on some of the gas it imports from Algeria.
""But the French are not at all in favour, and the viability of this project is far from certain,"" said Gonzalo Escribano, an expert at the Elcano Institute.
Analysts say Spanish officials suspect that France wants to protect its huge nuclear power industry and its former energy monopolies, in which the state still owns stakes, from foreign competition.
""I'm not expecting any breakthrough on the gas question, that's where the talks are going to be tough,"" Escribano said.
Before the summit, Macron will hold one of his trademark ""citizen consultations"" on the future of Europe, speaking and answering questions from dozens of young people alongside Costa.
The town-hall style meetings are seen by Macron as a way to counter the rise in populist and far-right governments ahead of European Parliament elections next year."

His poor Spanish has meant Osamah Alabed Almohsen, who was a first division football coach in Syria, has been suspended from his job with a football school. And he is now considering leaving Spain.
Camerawoman Petra Laszlo sparked global outrage after television footage in September 2015 showed her tripping up a man -- later identified as Almohsen -- sprinting with a child in his arms, and kicking another running child near the Hungarian border with Serbia.
A Hungarian court last week sentenced her to three years' probation for disorderly conduct. The judge rejected her lawyer's argument that she was merely trying to protect herself.
Almohsen declined to discuss the incident in an interview with AFP except to say he has ""forgotten"" Laszlo, who said she has been subjected to a ""hate campaign"" since the footage emerged.
""I need to look out for the future of me and my family, I don't have time to think about this journalist,"" he said in halting Spanish in the living room of his two-bedroom flat in Getafe, a city on the outskirts of Madrid.
""I feel sad, but hopeful,"" the bearded and grey-haired 52-year-old said. ""I have three of my sons with me but the youngest needs his mother,"" said Almohsen in a reference to nine-year-old Zeid, whom he was carrying when he
was tripped.
He arrived in Spain later that month with Zeid and his 17-year-old son Mohamed. His oldest son Almohanned, 19, joined him at the end of 2016. But his wife and 15-year-old daughter remain in Turkey, where the family
fled in 2012 to escape Syria's civil war. They have a visa to enter Spain but still have not received the green light from Turkish authorities to leave, Almohsen said.
Zeid, who comes to sit beside his father on the sofa when he hears his name mentioned, said he talks on the telephone with his mother almost every day.
Speaking in perfect Spanish, the lively boy said he likes to meet his new friend Alex, a neighbour, to play hide-and-seek or cops and robbers at the building's patio.
He shows with pride an album with photos of his meeting with his hero, Real Madrid football superstar Cristiano Ronaldo, shortly after he arrived in Spain and a football signed by the squad's players.
Zeid accompanied Ronaldo when Real Madrid entered the pitch before the kickoff of a match and received applause from the crowd.
When the director of a Spanish academy dedicated to training football coaches, Cenafe, saw the video of his father being tripped up, it offered to hire Almohsen -- who was formerly manager of Syrian first division side, Al-Fotuwa.
But Almohsen speaks little English and has struggled to learn Spanish, which led Cenafe to decide in September to not renew his contract. The academy is still paying the rent on his apartment though.
""We are not going to leave him on the street,"" said Cenafe director Miguel Angel Galan.
If his Spanish improves, the door is open for Almohsen to return to Cenafe, he said.
""I think he has not formed relationships with Spanish people"" and spends most of his time with Arab speakers, said Galan.
Almohsen -- who speaks German in addition to Arabic -- says he is taking Spanish lessons, although he is considering moving again to another European country like Germany or the Netherlands.
""If I can't get a job, I will have to go to another country, and with my family together it will be easier,"" he said.
He wants to keep sending money to his 84-year-old mother in Damascus, whom he speaks to whenever he can.
But he said he has lost touch with his friends in his hometown of Deir Ezzor, a besieged Syrian government enclave. He hopes to continue working in football, his passion.
""He always comes by, not just to watch Real Madrid play,"" said Jose Manuel, in charge of the bar in Getafe where Almohsen usually goes to watch football matches, often with Zeid."

The group, Proactiva Open Arms, said on Twitter its boat was being kept at the Sicilian port of Pozzallo, where it docked on Saturday after rescuing more than 200 people off the coast of Libya.

A Sicilian prosecutor's office was quoted by Italian media as saying it had opened an investigation against the NGO and impounded the boat.
On Thursday, the rescue ship went to the aid of two boats that were in difficulty 73 miles off the Libyan coast, after being alerted by the Italian coastguard.
But Italian authorities then informed the Spanish group's ship that the Libyan coastguard was in charge and a Libyan coastguard speedboat soon arrived at the scene.

In such cases, the Libyan coastguard frequently intervenes before a rescue ship sent by the Italian authorities arrives.
But an NGO spokeswoman said it was the first time that Italy had actually asked a humanitarian ship to participate in an operation coordinated by Tripoli.
If the rescue is coordinated by Tripoli, the migrants will be sent back to Libya instead of being taken to Italy.
For this reason, the Open Arms vessel refused to hand over the rescued migrants and headed north instead, evacuating a mother and her newborn child in Malta, because they were in need of urgent care.
The ship then arrived in Italy and was allowed to dock on Saturday by the authorities because of the ""frail condition of the migrants on board.""
According to organisations such as the United Nations Refugee Agency, migrants face appalling conditions in Libya.
A 22-year-old Eritrean, rescued at sea by the Open Arms ship last week after spending 18 months in detention in Libya, died from severe malnutrition just hours after landing in Sicily."

The ship's plight has caused a rift across Europe this week, but Spain has agreed to take the 629 migrants after Italy and Malta refused the ship permission to dock. It is scheduled to arrive in Valencia on Sunday.
""Spain can not rule out anything,"" said government spokeswoman Isabel Celaa after a cabinet meeting. ""Spain is acting totally normally, as Europe usually works,"" she added in response to a journalist who asked if the government would rule out sending Aquarius passengers back to their countries of origin.
Every migrant ""will know if he has refugee status, if he is an economic migrant, and also, indeed, if he is guilty of certain offences that make him liable to expulsion,"" added the spokeswoman for the government of socialist

Once on EU soil, migrants can apply for asylum in the first European country they enter. If rejected, they can be returned to their country of origin.
Celaa insisted that Spain's priority was ""respect for human dignity, respect for human rights"", referencing the government's aim to remove barbed wire from the fences around Spain's enclaves of Ceuta and Melilla in northern Morocco.
She also announced that Spain would repeal a regulation limiting access to care for illegal immigrants. Meanwhile, Doctors Without Borders (MSF), who along with French charity SOS Mediterranée are treating migrants on board Aquarius, said two passengers drowned last weekend when the ship first encountered difficulties off Libya.
MSF said it could only confirm the deaths now because many of the passengers took several days to recover from shock."

					09:29 CET+01:00				",AFP/The Local,Catalonia's deposed leader Puigdemont seeking legal advice in Belgium,"Carles Puigdemont, who was removed from office as Catalonia's president last week by Madrid's central government, spoke with a lawyer in Belgium on Monday as Spanish prosecutors sought rebellion charges against the region's separatist leaders.
But Paul Bekaert, who specializes in asylum issues, said ""Puigdemont is not in Belgium to request asylum"", only to prepare a legal riposte to any eventual moves by Madrid.
""On this matter (asylum) nothing has yet been decided,"" he told Flemish television VRT. ""I spoke with him personally in Belgium... and he officially made me his lawyer.
""I have more than 30 years of experience with the extradition and political asylum for Spanish Basques, and it's probably because of this experience that he came to me.""
Spanish media outlets reported that Puigdemont was travelling with several members of his axed government.
Bekaert was one of the lawyers for Luis Maria Zengotitabengoa, a suspected member of the armed Basque separatist group ETA, whose extradition from Belgium to Spain was authorised in 2010.
Spain's chief prosecutor Jose Manuel Maza said he was seeking charges including rebellion -- punishable by up to 30 years in prison -- and sedition against the Catalan leaders who were sacked by Madrid on Friday October 27th.
Maza said they had ""caused an institutional crisis that led to the unilateral declaration of independence carried out on October 27 with total contempt for our constitution."" A court now has to decide whether to bring charges.
Threat of persecution?
But several experts said it seemed unlikely that Puigdemont would be able to secure the status of political refugee in Belgium. ""It's quite exceptional to obtain asylum for a citizen of a European Union country,"" Dirk Van Den Bulck of Belgium's CGRA refugee agency told RTBF television.
He would have to prove a ""threat of persecution"" in his country of origin and an impossibility of being protected there, Van Den Bulck said, which would be a direct contradiction of ""the respect of fundamental rights"" required of all EU members.
Belgium's immigration minister, a member of the Flemish separatist N-VA party, suggested Saturday that Puigdemont could receive asylum.
But Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel later poured cold water on the idea, and an N-VA spokesperson told AFP the party had not invited Puigdemont to Brussels.
Puigdemont maintains that the result of the banned independence referendum on October 1st gave the region's parliament a mandate to declare on October 27th that it was breaking away from Spain.
Following this declaration, Madrid sacked Catalan's leaders and took control of the semi-autonomous region under a previously unused ""nuclear option"" in the constitution.
Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy called snap elections for December 21 to replace the Catalan parliament in a bid to stop the secessionist drive.
The European Union has largely spurned the independence declaration, and several EU institutions told AFP that no meetings are planned with Puigdemont in Brussels.
A spokesman for Puigdemont's entourage said the former Catalan president will give a press conference at 12.30pm CET to explain ""his work"" in Brussels, reports Spanish daily El Mundo.
""I don't want to prejudice anything,"" Belgium's deputy prime minister, Kris Peeters, told Belgian daily echo.be. ""But when one is calling for independence, it is better to remain close to one's people.""
Lawyer Paul Bekaert said Puigdemont has ""no intention of hiding in Belgium.""

Migration ministers from all 28 EU member state met in Brussels on Monday in an attempt to finalize European Commission plans to resettle 40,000 refugees based in Italy and Greece and another 20,000 asylum seekers from outside of Europe.
The original relocation proposal announced earlier this year by the European commission called for a binding distribution of the migrants across member states to alleviate the asylum demand pressure on Greece and Italy, where most migrants first land after crossing the Mediterranean.
But after several hours of talks, the European Commission's plan remained in limbo as some nations asked for more time before committing to a set quota.
Spain had rejected the compulsory quota plan and instead offered to relocate just 1,300 migrants as part of the scheme, a figure representing less than a third of the commission's original proposal.
Speaking in Brussels after the meeting, Jorge Fernandez Diaz, the Spanish Interior Minister said that he ""radically disagreed"" with the European Commission plan on migrants arguing that it sends the wrong message to migrants and the organizations that traffic them.
He likened Europe's immigration problem to ""a house suffering lots of leaks that is flooding different rooms"" and dismissed the proposed solution as ""the distribution of flood water between the rooms rather than plugging the leak,"" reported Spanish daily newspaper El Pais.
""The Spaniards had some difficulties with the figures proposed by the Commission"", said a French diplomat according to the EU Observer.
The meeting saw nations make voluntary provisions to relocate 32,000 migrants but that leaves another 8,000 who need to be allocated by the end of the year, the EU said.
""We are almost there. The remaining 8,000 will be allocated by the end of this year, by December,"" EU home affairs commissioner Dimitris Avramopoulos told a press conference.
""I want to be frank with you. I am disappointed that this did not happen today but it was a very important step forward,"" he said.
""This shows that a voluntary scheme is difficult to implement and whenever it was tried before, it has failed,"" he added.
At least 1,900 migants have died this year attempting to make the perilous journey across the Mediterranean to Europe out of an estimated 150,000 who have made the crossing, said the International Organisation for Migration earlier this month.
The migrants are seeking refuge from conflicts and poverty in Africa and the Middle East.
Some governments – including those in central and eastern Europe – objected to earlier EU proposals to establish quotas on migrant arrivals.EU sources said the countries that were most reluctant to admit migrants were Hungary, Austria, Slovakia, Slovenia, the Baltic countries and Spain.
Germany and France have offered to take the most with 10,500 and 6,752 respectively, while Sweden,which already accepts the most asylum seekers per capita in the EU, offered to relocate just over 1,800 migrants as part of the scheme.
Both the UK and Ireland have opt-in on justice and home affairs policies and don't have to participate. But Ireland decided to take in 600 people anyway.
Denmark's opt-out clause on justice issues means it won't be involved."

European Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker was expected to unveil a plan on Wednesday to relocate 120,000 refugees in EU countries under a mandatory quota system.

The Miró sale at Christie's auction house in London is aiming to raise €50,000 ($56,600) for the Red Cross humanitarian organisation.
The Barcelona painter's grandson told AFP that he would donate the proceeds of the sale because that is what Miró would have wanted.
""I consider myself as the torch-bearer for his wishes and try to do what he would do if he was still alive,"" Joan Punyet Miró said.
""Miró was a man who endured many hardships throughout his life. He went hungry, and lived in exile through the Spanish Civil War.""
He was also conscious of the Spanish refugees living in camps across the border in southern France during the 1936-1939 conflict, and of the 2,000-odd of their number who sailed from France to Chile on board the SS Winnipeg.
Miró, who had Republican sympathies in the civil war divide, was in France when the conflict broke out, and decided to stay in Paris.
His wife and daughter joined him and lived in France until 1940, when the invasion of Nazi Germany saw him flee back to Spain.

""He always wanted to help the most disadvantaged, the refugees and those in exile, and would be aware that what is happening today in Syria could happen tomorrow in Spain,"" said Punyet.
Since the Syria conflict erupted in 2011, more than 4.8 million refugees have fled the country.
Miró, who died in 1983 aged 90, had personal reasons to be grateful for the work of the Red Cross.
A doctor from the international organisation saved the leg of his only child, Punyet's then 34-year-old mother, after a nasty car accident in 1965.
She recovered after spending a year in bed.
""My grandfather made a tapestry for the Red Cross in gratitude, because they had saved his daughter, his only child,"" said Punyet.
Barcelona's Mayoral Galeria d'Art, which is working on the fundraising effort, has exhibited the works in several art spaces.

After interviewing more than 80 asylum seekers and refugees and visiting several reception centres, the rights group concluded these faced big - often years-long - waits for their cases to be dealt with, coupled with inadequate financial aid that forced some onto the streets.
""There are governments like ours that don't have the will to take in (refugees), that welcome them in dribs and drabs, despite public opinion that on the whole wants to take them in, as do most regional public administrations,"" Amnesty Spain director Esteban Beltran told reporters.
Spain gave protection to 1,030 asylum seekers in 2015 - be it refugee status or subsidiary protection, one step down - meaning that they were allowed to stay in the country, according to the Eurostat statistics agency.
READ MORE: Refugees welcome. So Where are they?
That figure pales in comparison to more than 26,000 in neighbouring France and 5,605 in Bulgaria.
Germany meanwhile saw a record influx with over 475,000 asylum requests filed and over 140,000 accepted so far.
Spain is also one of the European countries with the lowest rate of asylum applications.
Last year, some 1.3 million people coming mostly from conflict-ridden Syria and Iraq asked for asylum in the European Union.
So far this year, some 204,000 people have crossed the Mediterranean to the continent, according to the UN refugee agency.
Lucky few
And while Spain has pledged to take in more than 17,000 refugees from camps inside and outside the European Union, these have only just started to trickle in.
Amnesty warned that even these lucky few were facing an uphill struggle.
The system sees asylum seekers stay in reception centres for up to nine months.
They are then cast out into the wider world, receiving financial help for rent and other necessities for six more months, and up to 11 for the most vulnerable.
And it ends there, apart from the odd exception.
The NGO said Spain had so far offered asylum to just 208 people under a pledge to accept 1,884 asylum seekers by 2017.

The NGO added that the system is discriminatory, with Syrian asylum seekers' applications often seen to be dealt with more quickly than people from sub-Saharan Africa for instance.
""The system can't keep going like this,"" said Beltran, calling on whatever new government that emerges after June elections to reform it.

On Wednesday, the Sea-Watch charity said Malta has blocked its reconnaissance plane ""Moonbird"" from taking off, after impounding its Sea-Watch 3 vessel on Monday.

""About 1000 would have drowned for sure, if our #Moonbird would not have found their sinking boats at the last second,"" said Sea-Watch on Twitter.
Faced with growing tensions in the EU over the issue, member states struck a deal on Friday to stem the arrival of migrants.
The accord includes the setting up of secure centres for migrants in the bloc, ""disembarkation platforms"" outside the bloc and sharing out refugees among member states.

But as the group, comprising eight men and four women, arrived on a flight from Rome to begin their new lives in Spain, Spanish NGO's questioned why it had taken so long for the first refugees to arrive in a crisis that reached emergency proportions.

After initially refusing to accept a mandatory quota agreement from the EU, Spain's government said in early September that it would accept 14,931 refugees bowing to public pressure within Spain that the nation should shoulder its share of the burden.
Public campaigns were launched across Spain calling on the government to accept more refugees and hundreds of councils have measures in place to welcome refugees risking their lives to reach Europe.

""Stop Guiris"" and ""Tourism is destroying our city"" are two of the others in a recent spate of graffiti that is angering visitors and local residents alike.
The anti-tourism phrases suggest a growing malaise at the number of holidaymakers crowding into the Balearic capital as residents complain that tourism is destroying local neighbourhoods.

Residents of La Seu, the historic old quarter of narrow cobbled streets around the city's Gothic cathedral, bemoan the fact that on top of having to suffer inundations of tourists, they now also have their neighbourhood blighted by graffiti.
""Not only have we do deal with the burden of tourist saturation which is bringing the neighbourhood to near collapse, but we are now held to be responsible for removing the anti-tourist slogans from our walls,"" said a written complaint from the residents association to City Hall.
""The council has ignored the problem, claiming that residents should be responsible for cleaning and repainting walls. They will only deal with graffiti if it is on council property,"" it continued.
Residents are also furious about a new trend by tourists to daub or scratch love hearts on the medieval walls of Calle Palau to symbolize their love.
""People who live here have even heard tour guides encouraging holidaymakers by telling them this is a street of love. By doing so they are turning an act of vandalism into a tourist attraction,"" a spokesman from the residents’ association told Europa Press.
Earlier this year neighbours demanded that something be done to limit tourism. ""This quarter is turning into a theme park for the exclusive use and enjoyment of tourists,"" the group said.
Mallorca authorities have been battling to clean up the image of the island and appeal more to big spenders and family groups than the badly behaved cheap tourists attracted to resorts like Magaluf.
Last year they brought in a raft of by laws that saw a ban on drinking in the street, late licensing and happy hours and even brought in British police officers to patrol the streets.
Mallorca isn’t the first place in Spain to express malaise at the booming tourism industry. Barcelona residents have been fighting back to reclaim the character of traditional neighbourhoods overcrowded by tourists.
City authorities have set a limit on the building of new tourist accommodation and are attempting to curb the rental of private homes through services such as Airbnb."

The migrants managed to get around the border fence where it meets a breakwater on the Mediterranean shore of Ceuta, the Spanish government delegation there said in a statement.
Some of the migrants that tried to make it through in the early morning dash for the border were held back by Moroccan security forces.
Of the 87 that managed to cross, some breached the fence while others went into the sea and swam around the breakwater, the statement said.
Eleven of the migrants said they were minors, it added. The migrants were all in good health, though 10 of them and three Spanish police officers were treated for light injuries.
Along with Melilla to the east, Ceuta is one of two Spanish territories on the northern coast of Morocco that together form the European Union’s only land borders with Africa.
Meanwhile, almost 200 migrants from North and sub-Sahara Africa were rescued overnight as they tried to reach southern Spain in makeshift vessels, Spanish coastal rescue officials said on Sunday.
""Maritime rescue services picked up 188 people from seven craft,"" a spokesman told AFP.
A Red Cross spokesman told AFP that 103 Algerians, half of them minors, were aboard five craft off the southern port of Almeria.
Two other vessels were crammed with 85 sub-Saharan Africans.
In this latter group, one craft was intercepted off Spain's Alboran island and the other off the Andalusian coast, opposite the northern Moroccan port city of Al-Hoceima.
Four of the sub-Saharan migrants were hospitalised, two of them pregnant women.
According to the International Organization for Migration, 2,819 migrants crossed the narrow strait to Spain from North Africa between January and the end of September.
Thousands of migrants have tried to reach Spain from north Africa.
Many try to smuggle themselves across the border to Ceuta and Melilla hidden in cars while others cross the Mediterranean in flimsy boats."

The Archbishop of Valencia, Cardinal Antonio Cañizares, sparked controversy on Wednesday when he questioned whether welcoming refugees to Spain from Syria was such a good idea.
""What’s happening in Europe?"" the Catholic bishop asked. ""This invasion of immigrants... are they completely trustworthy? Where will it leave Spain in a few years?""
Cañizares was speaking during a forum on Europe and the Mediterranean organized by the New Economic Forum.
He also raised the question of whether refugees were coming to Spain ""because they were being persecuted"" arguing that ""many are not"".
He called for ""clarity"" and to see ""who is behind all this"".
""We must be clear headed and not let everyone in, because today it could be someone who gets along very well, but it is in fact the Trojan horse for European societies and specifically Spain.""
Cañizares is so stranger to controversy and was criticised in 2009 for claiming abortion was worse than child abuse when he said:
""What happened in some schools cannot be compared with the millions of lives that have been destroyed by abortion. It has legally destroyed 40 million human lives.""
Poverty in Spain
The Spanish archbishop also played down reports of increased poverty in Spain, arguing that ""you don’t see any more people than before on the streets or living under bridges.""
He said claims were ""exaggerated"" and that Spaniards needed to ""recognize the economic recovery"" in Spain.
The cardinal's words contradict those of his boss. Pope Francis recently urged ""every Catholic parish in Europe"" to take in a refugee family, setting the ultimate example by putting up a Syrian refugee family in a Vatican apartment.

					14:29 CET+01:00				",AFP,'We didn't fire rubber bullets at migrants',"Officials in Spain on Friday denied security forces had fired rubber bullets at migrants trying to swim to Spanish soil, after 14 Africans drowned in the attempt.
The 14, including one woman, drowned on Thursday while trying to reach the Spanish territory of Ceuta from a beach in neighbouring Morocco. Other migrants tried to storm through a land checkpoint.
Spanish media cited migrants alleging that police fired into the sea where the Africans were swimming, as Moroccan and Spanish security forces tried to repel them from Ceuta.
Spanish authorities said police in Ceuta used rubber bullets to ward off the migrants but that they fired them in the air and did not target anyone directly.
""We did not use anti-riot equipment when the immigrants were in the water,"" said the head of the Spanish government's delegation in Ceuta, Francisco Antonio Gonzalez, speaking on the radio on Friday.
Spain's opposition Socialist Party called on Interior Minister Jorge Fernandez Diaz to appear in parliament to answer questions on the deaths of the nine migrants.
In Morocco the head of the Northern Human Rights Observatory, Mohamed Benaissa, told AFP on Thursday that several migrants were hurt as Spanish police tried to repel them. He said most of the migrants were from Cameroon.
The Spanish government delegation said late Thursday that ""rubber bullets were fired in the air, over a six-metre fence, never against people"", by Spanish police to ward off the migrants trying to cross by land.
Morocco, under pressure from Spain, is trying to stem a stream of sub-Saharan African migrants, who head to its northern shores in a desperate quest to reach mainland Europe.
Ceuta and Spain's other north African enclave, Melilla, have the European Union's only land borders with Africa.
Hundreds of migrants headed out from the Moroccan town of Fnideq in a mass attempt to cross or circumvent the six-metre (20-foot) fences that mark the land border with Ceuta on Thursday, officials on both sides said.
Gonzalez said the migrants were ""very violent"" and threw rocks at the Moroccan and Spanish security forces.
A spokeswoman in Spain for the United Nations refugee watchdog UNHCR, Maria Jesus Vega, expressed ""dismay and great sadness"" at the deaths.
""It worries us that people who need international protection and are risking their lives to get to safe countries, are losing their lives trying to enter the countries of the European Union."""

					17:13 CEST+02:00				",Lee Roden,10 facts on Catalan President and pro-independence leader Carles Puigdemont,"The face of the pro independence campaign, Catalan regional President is one of the key figures in the upcoming plebiscite in the north-eastern region of Spain. Here are 10 facts to know about the separatist leader.
1. Born in 1962, Puidemont was named after his grandfather, Carles Casamajó, who fled to France at the end of the Spanish Civil War and lived at various refugee camps before disappearing in 1943. The family hasn't found any trace of him since.
2. The 54-year-old hails from the town of Amer in the hills west of Girona, where textiles are the dominant industry. Politics aside, his family is best known locally for its patisserie, which is famous for its capricis, a kind of biscotti.

A post shared by Roger Puigví (@rpuigvi) on Sep 3, 2016 at 3:43am PDT
3. Puigdemont's uncle Josep was mayor of Amer between 1979 and 1983. The younger Puigdemont's first taste of politics came when he helped found the Girona district of Joventut Nacionalista de Catalunya (JNC), the youth branch of the Catalan European Democratic Party in the early 1980s. Around that time he was also caught in a serious accident while driving from Girona to Amer, when his Seat Marbella collided with a truck. Though he ""miraculously"" survived despite serious injuries, the Catalan President still has scars from the collision to this day.
4. A journalist by trade, he started out writing reports on football for newspaper Los Sitios at the age of 14. A few years later, he dropped out of his degree in philology at Girona University College because his journalistic work for newspaper El Punt Diari (now El Punt Avui) was too time-consuming.
5. It proved a wise move, as the Amer native would eventually end up editor in chief of El Punt. During his time at the newspaper he took a sabbatical year to travel Europe. The result, published in 1994, was his book “Cata...what? Catalunya as seen by the international press”, which looked at the understanding (or lack) of Catalonia abroad in the build-up to the Barcelona Olympics.
6. A multi-linguist, Puigdemont speaks English, French and Romanian on top of his native Catalan and Spanish. He learned Romanian through his wife, Marcela Topor, who he met while she was visiting a festival in Girona, then later went to visit in her native Romania before convincing her to relocate to Spain.

He is also one of the founders of English language news paper Catalonia Today, as well as founder and former director of the Catalan News Agency, a media agency owned by the Catalan government with international branches in Berlin, Brussels, London, New York and Paris.
7. Through a close friend of former FC Barcelona President Joan Laporta, Puigdemont is a supporter of local team Girona FC, who won promotion to La Liga for the first time in the club's history in the summer of 2017. He can sporadically be seen in the club's executive box during match days.

8. Puigdemont's political career started relatively late, in 2007 he was elected as a member of the opposition at Girona City Hall, before being elected mayor four years later and breaking Socialist rule that had stood there since 1979.
Opinions of his time as mayor are mixed: critics say he isn't present enough in day to day life, spending most of his time away in Barcelona. Admirers praise him for helping to convince Game of Thrones to film in Girona, as well as for funding the archiving of art critic Raael Santos i Torroella's collection which includes original work by Joan Miro and Pablo Picasso.
9. In 2016, the Girona Mayor won a vote of confidence in the Catalan parliament to be named new President. He had not been one of the favourites, and emerged at the eleventh hour to end a three-month political stalemate after the various member parties in the pro-independence Junts pel Sí struggled to agree on a candidate to preside over their government.
10. Politically, Puigdemont has been defined as somewhere between a centrist and a social democrat, who appeals more to those on the left of centre than previous Catalan President Artur Mas thanks to his relatively humble upbringing in Amer away from the Barcelona bourgeoisie.

					11:07 CEST+02:00				",Emma Anderson ,Spaniards most accepting of refugees worldwide,"An astounding 97 percent of Spanish respondents said that yes, they would ""personally accept people fleeing war or persecution"" into their country, according to a survey by Amnesty International.
Amnesty released for the first time the Refugees Welcome Index on Thursday, measuring people's willingness to have refugees live in their countries, towns, neighbourhoods or even their own homes.
The human rights organization surveyed 27,000 people across 27 countries on questions of whether refuge should be offered to those fleeing violence, whether their country should accept refugees or whether they themselves would take refugees into their own homes.
While Spain was ranked sixth place overall, Spaniards came out at number one for having the most people who personally wanted their country to take in refugees fleeing war or persecution.
""Spain has one of the most favourable positions towards hosting refugees and asylum-seekers of the countries surveyed,"" the Amnesty International report for Spain stated.
But in stark contrast, Spain's government has been quite slow to take in refugees, accepting roughly 20 people from overwhelmed Greece and Italy since it agreed to an EU shared responsibility plan that entailed sheltering some 15,000 asylum seekers in Spain alone.
In the Amnesty survey, Spain also had one of the highest percentages of people who said they agreed or strongly agreed that their government should do more to help people escaping conflict and persecution at 82 percent.
Critics have blamed the conservative government under acting Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy for dragging their feet on the matter.
""While 61 percent of Spanish respondents [strongly] believe the government should do something more for refugees and asylum seekers… the authorities in Spain continue to maintain ridiculous figures for resettlement and relocation,"" the report stated.
A number of regional governments last year set up a network for people to register to voluntarily take refugees into their own homes, including in Barcelona and Madrid.
Over one in six Spanish respondents (18 percent) to the Amnesty survey said they would indeed bring refugees into their homes for shelter, which put Spain at fourth place in this category behind just China (46 percent), the UK (29 percent) and Greece (20 percent).
The country to come out on top for overall most welcoming in the survey was China, followed by Germany, the UK, Canada and Australia.

Just under half of the respondents in China said they would take refugees into their own homes at 46 percent.
The countries ranked lowest for acceptance were Kenya, Poland, Thailand, Indonesia, and Russia at the very bottom.
Still, overall 80 percent of those polled around the world said they would ""welcome refugees with open arms"".
""These figures speak for themselves,"" said Amnesty International Secretary General Salil Shetty in a statement.
""People are ready to make refugees welcome, but governments' inhumane responses to the refugee crisis are badly out of touch with the views of their own citizens.""

The appeal from Anne Hidalgo of Paris, Barcelona's Ada Colau, and the mayors of the Greek and Italian islands of Lesbos and Lampedusa – which have become key entry points for migrants entering Europe – was published in top-selling Spanish daily El Pais.
""European cities are ready to become places of refuge. States grant the status of asylum but it is cities that provide shelter,"" they wrote in the column titled: ""We, the cities of Europe"".
""Our municipal services are already working on hosting plans to ensure bread, shelter and dignity to all who flee war and hunger. All that is needed is the help of States,"" they said.
The column was published on the eve of an extraordinary meeting of EU interior ministers in Brussels called to seek urgent solutions to a migration crisis unprecedented in the bloc's history.
""We ask that they do not turn their backs on cities, that they listen to the cry that is coming from them, we need the support and cooperation of states.""
City halls, charities and impromptu Facebook groups across Europe are marshalling offers of aid, putting pressure national governments to accept refugees risking their lives to reach Europe from trouble spots such as Syria.
Colau in August called for the establishment of a ""network of cities of refuge to give a home to thousands of civilians fleeing from war"".
Since then, more than 100 Spanish cities have taken up the call: among them Madrid, Cadiz, A Coruna, Santiago de Compostela and Zaragoza.
The biggest refugee crisis plaguing Europe since World War II has divided the continent with Germany pushing for compulsory quotas within the Europe Union but eastern European nations snubbing the proposal.
The International Organization for Migration said over 430,000 migrants and refugees had crossed the Mediterranean to Europe so far in 2015, with 2,748 dying or going missing en route."

""The search has ended and it will not be resumed,"" a coastguard spokesman said, a day after rescuers plucked 15 migrants alive from the remains of the boat and found the bodies of four others.
The coastguard began looking for the stricken boat after receiving a call on Wednesday from an NGO based in Morocco which warned that a vessel loaded with migrants had departed from a beach near Al Hoceima.
A coastguard vessel spotted the troubled boat just after midday on Thursday, some 39 nautical miles (72 kilometres) northwest of the town of Al Hoceima in northern Morocco.
Two women and 13 men were clinging to what was left of the boat, which had lost its hull. Some of the migrants did not have life jackets.
The 15 rescued migrants, who were transported by the coastguard ship to the southern Spanish port of Malaga, said there had been 39 other people on board who fell overboard.
It is the most serious migrant boat accident off the coast of Spain this year and it came as at least 17 children and nine adults drowned when three boats sank en route from Turkey to Greece.
The migrants on the boat were from the Ivory Coast, Nigeria, Mali, Guinea and Cameroon, said Helena Maleno of the NGO which first sounded the alarm, Caminando Fronteras.
A total of 12 women were on board the boat, including two who were pregnant and who are among the missing, she added.
""We learned of the departure of the boat because we received calls from family members of those on board,"" Maleno told AFP.
The 15 surviving migrants were presented before a judge on Friday to begin the deportation from Spain without taking into account that ""they just had a huge shock,"" she added.
""They are people who have been displaced due to tragedy and conflict. They are not met with the respect of international conventions,"" said Maleno.
""If they had been French victims of a bus accident in Spain, they would not be treated like this.""
This year alone, more than 3,000 people have died while trying to make the perilous journey to Europe across the Mediterranean. More than half a million people have made the voyage in Europe's worst migration crisis since World War II, most to Greece and Italy."

Having gone to the aid of two vessels in difficulty and taken 218 people on board the Open Arms, Proactiva refused the Libyan coast guard's orders to hand over the migrants. According to the aid group, Libyan guards threatened to kill their crew if they did not surrender those rescued, who included women and children.
Instead the Spanish ship sailed for Sicily, in what Italian prosecutors allege was a deliberate plan to bring the migrants to Italy.
According to the Italian coast guard, international norms usually require ships to wait for their country of origin to arrange where migrants rescued at sea should be taken. The Open Arms sailed for Italy while still awaiting directions from the Spanish government and despite the fact that it was closer to Malta at the time, the coast guard said.
The group defended itself by saying that Malta only deals with medical emergencies and that forcibly returning migrants to Libya would have placed their lives in danger.
The group's supporters organized protests in Madrid and Barcelona and more than 300,000 people signed petitions calling for the ship's release, under the slogan: ""Saving lives is not a crime.""

Italy seized another rescue ship, the Iuventa, in August on similar allegations that the German NGO that operates it had facilitated illegal immigration.
The ship remains impounded in Lampedusa, despite the group's efforts to get it back. A new hearing is scheduled for April 23rd.
More than 600,000 migrants are believed to have reached Italy by boat in the past four years, though arrivals fell by 34 percent in 2017, according to the EU border agency.
The drop is largely attributed to an accord between Italy and Libya, which has seen the Libyan coast guard assume responsibility for a large part of rescue operations.
Last year around a dozen NGO ships patrolled the coast off Libya. Now there are only two such ships, with others suspending their operations following the drop in departures, as well as threats from Libya and the seizure of boats.
According to the United Nations Refugee Agency, migrants face appalling conditions in Libya. A 22-year-old Eritrean, rescued at sea by the Open Arms ship last month after spending 18 months in detention in Libya, died from severe malnutrition just hours after landing in Sicily.

					17:10 CEST+02:00				",AFP,Podemos lawmakers launch hunger strike over refugees,"Four lawmakers from Spain's far-left party Podemos and its allies said Wednesday they are on a week-long hunger strike to try to rally public support of refugees.
The lawmakers began their hunger strike on Saturday and are calling on people to occupy public squares for 24 hours on Friday, the day they plan to end their action , in a gesture of support for those people at the centre of Europe's biggest migrant crisis since World War II.
The idea stems ""from the shame we felt over the agreement between the European Union and Turkey, seeing how Europe violates internation law,"" Podemos lawmaker Pedro Arrojo told AFP.
Under a controversial deal reached in March Turkey agreed to take back all migrants arriving at the Greek islands, in an effort to relieve the pressure on the European Union which has seen over a million migrant arrivals since early 2015.
In return the EU promised to resettle one Syrian refugee for every Syrian taken back by Turkey, capped at 72,000.
Visa-free travel will also be granted to Turks within the border-free Schengen Zone under the deal and Turkey's stalled EU membership bid will be reassessed.
But the EU-sanctioned deportations have drawn sharp criticism, with Human Rights Watch describing them as ""abusive"" and expressing concern about the fate of the deportees.
'Simply atrocious'
Arrojo, who has consumed only water with salt and sugar since Saturday, said he hoped to transform public indignation over the plight of migrants ""into action"".
""We have seen that initiatives are starting to bloom. There is a parish that is collecting shoes for refugees,"" said Arrojo who represents to northeastern city of Zaragoza for Podemos.
Twenty-four hour assemblies are planned for a dozens cities on Friday, including Madrid, he added.
Podemos was born out of the ""Indignado"" protest moment against corruption and economic inequality that filled Spanish squares in 2011.
Miguel Anxo Fernan Vello, a lawmaker with regional Galician party En Marea which is allied to Podemos, said he was taking part in the hunger strike because he was angered that Spain has welcomed only a handful of refugees since the migrant crisis started.
Spain's conservative government agreed last year to accept around 16,000 refugees from Greece and Italy but so far only 18 have arrived.
""This is not a failure, this is simply atrocious,"" he told AFP.
Over 178,000 people have risked their lives crossing the Mediterranean so far this year, and 737 have died or gone missing while making the perilous journey to Europe, according to the International Organization for Migration.
The UN refugee agency said on Wednesday it feared around 500 migrants from Africa had drowned in the Mediterranean, in what could be one of the worst tragedies since the start of the migrant crisis."

While the focus has often been on the migrants and refugees heading to Europe via Turkey, Greece and Italy, a smaller number also head for Spain.
On Wednesday, another boat heading from Morocco towards the southern Spanish city of Cadiz was intercepted by a Moroccan patrol vessel.
Two people were rescued, but nine others were reported missing and feared dead, the Spanish coast guard spokeswoman said.
The migrant vessel was found near the Moroccan coast, as the would-be asylum seekers made a desperate bid to cross the Strait of Gibraltar despite poor weather, she said.
More than 13,000 migrants arrived in Spain in 2016, 8,100 of them by sea, the International Organization for Migration says."

Hundreds of people on board a migrant rescue boat, including pregnant women and children, have been stranded in the Mediterranean between Italy and Malta as both countries refuse to allow the vessel to dock.
Some 629 people were saved by SOS Mediterranean on Saturday and are stuck aboard the French NGO's ship Aquarius, which is currently between Malta and Sicily waiting for a secure port.
“We call on the government of Spain to urgently designate a safe port for the Aquarius and demonstrate that not all Mediterranean countries ignore human rights,” said a petition launched by Spain’s immigration network on change.org.

The migrants were rescued in six separate night-time operations in the central Mediterranean on Saturday. The French organisation said that 123 unaccompanied minors, 11 small children and seven pregnant women are among those brought on board.
Italy's spat with Malta began after its reported refusal to come to the aid of another rescue ship, Seefuchs, which was stranded with 126 migrants on board due to violent seas until it was allowed to dock at the Sicilian port of Pozzallo on Saturday.
Malta on Sunday reiterated its refusal to accept the Aquarius, ignoring calls from Rome.

Italy's hardline interior minister Matteo Salvini, in a joint statement with Danilo Toninelli, minister in charge of the Italian coastguard, insisted that Malta ""cannot continue to look the other way when it comes to respecting precise international conventions on the protection of human life"".
""That's why we ask the government in Valletta to take in the Aquarius in order to offer first aid to the migrants on board.""
Malta's government replied saying Prime Minister Joseph Muscat had spoken to Italian premier Giuseppe Conte and underlined ""that Malta is acting in full conformity with its international obligations"".
""As such Malta will not take the said vessel in its ports.""
EU rules mean migrants must apply for asylum in the European country where they first arrive, putting pressure on Italy and Greece, the entry points for hundreds of thousands of people fleeing war and poverty in the Middle East, Africa and Asia since 2015.
Spain’s new Socialist government has yet to outline its policy on refugees but Margarita Robles, the new minister of defence told Ser: “The priority must be to save human lives.”
“In the face of human drama it is essential for the EU to act,” she said that within the EU Spain has “a need and obligation” to help refugees. “This has to be a commitment by the EU as a whole.”
Speaking of Italy’s refusal to allow the refugees to disembark she added: “The situation with the Italian government is problematic.”
Spain's maritime rescue service said it has saved 231 migrants trying the cross the Mediterranean to reach Europe over the weekend.
The rescue service says its patrol craft intercepted six different boats carrying migrants that had left from African shores throughout Saturday.
Another boat found on Sunday was carrying four dead bodies along with 49 migrants.
The U.N. reports at least 785 migrants have died crossing the Med so far this year. Through the first five months of 2018, a total of 27,482 migrants reached European shores, with 7,614 of them arriving in Spain."

					12:15 CET+01:00				",Emma Anderson ,Six reasons why Spain is failing on human rights,"From a “gag law” limiting free speech to officers mistreating migrants and refugees, Spain still has a way to go on human rights, according to a new report by Amnesty International.
The campaign organization released on Wednesday its annual human rights report for 2015-16, declaring that the year ""saw a global assault on people's basic freedoms, with many governments brazenly breaking international law and deliberately undermining institutions meant to protect people's rights"" - and that includes in Spain.
""Spain also participates in this tendency to cut back on liberties and rights,"" the report states.
The Local looks at the biggest human rights concerns Amnesty International has for Spain.
1. Freedom of speech
Spaniards have been protesting as the country's new ""gag law"" comes into force. Photo: Dani Pozo/AFP
Spain implemented a new public security law in July, dubbed the ""gag law"" for its crackdown on peaceful protests, social media and even photographing police. Fines range from €100 up to €600,000 for violations.
The laws ""provide for offences which may disproportionately limit the legitimate exercise of the rights to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly,"" Amnesty International wrote in the report.
READ: The ten most repressive points of Spain's gag law
The law was pushed through by the conservative Popular Party of Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy after years of mostly peaceful anti-austerity protests.
2. Mistreatment of refugees and immigrants
Despite Spain's pledge to take in nearly 15,000 asylum-seekers under a European Union plan to redistribute refugees that arrive in member states, Spain offered just 130 resettlement places in 2015.
Amnesty criticized Spain for its poor treatment of immigrants and refugees trying to enter the country, particularly in its north African enclaves of Ceuta and Melilla. There, Guardia Civil officers have been conducting collective expulsions, forcing groups back to Morocco ""without any individualized assessment of their situation and without affording them an opportunity to claim asylum,"" Amnesty wrote.
Part of the gag law reforms also paved the way for migrants caught illegally entering Melilla or Ceuta to be collectively expelled, which is ""prohibited by international law,"" Amnesty noted.
The report also condemned investigations into Guardia Civil officers who were caught on video beating a migrant trying to climb over a border wall between Melilla and Morocco and then dragging him to the Moroccan side. The investigation was closed because officials said they could not identify the officers and an appeal has been pending.
Amnesty also criticize an investigation into Guardia Civil officers who fired rubber projectiles and smoke canisters at 200 migrants trying to swim from Morocco to Spain at Tarajal beach in Ceuta. At least 14 people drowned, and officers denied that their actions contributed to the deaths. The investigation was closed without any charges.
Asylum seeker accommodations in Melilla and Ceuta are also a problem, Amnesty explains. Many wait at least two months before they can be transferred to the mainland and facilities are overcrowded with poor medical and psychological care, Amnesty states.
3. Violence against women

Spain's Ministry of Health reported that 56 women were killed by current or former partners last year.
Domestic violence is a major concern in Spain as the country has fought to combat its ""machista"" reputation. More than one million cases of domestic violence have been dealt with by the Spanish courts since 2007 and judges have handed down jail sentences to 148,000 men.
Amnesty encouraged Spain to offer women more in terms of redress and protection and to train officials better in dealing with victims of domestic violence. It also echoed the UN's call to compensate a woman whose seven-year-old daughter was killed by her abusive father after authorities failed to act on numerous complaints from the mother.

4. Harsh counter-terrorism measures
A file photo of puppets. Photo: Leon Neal/AFP
Amnesty argues that Spanish law includes a too broad definition of what constitutes an act of terror and “could result in disproportionate restrictions on lawful exercise of freedom of expression”.
This issue came to a head recently when puppeteers in Madrid were detained after using play-on-words on banned Basque separatist group Eta. The two were later released under conditions following public outcry.
“What happened with the puppeteers is an example of how the broad definition of terrorism can impose a disproportionate limit on the freedom of expression,” said Amnesty International Spain's director Esteban Beltrán in a statement.
Amnesty also denounced Spain's ""incommunicado"" detention for holding terrorism suspects, which entails limited access to a lawyer, family members or an independent doctor. Human rights groups like Amnesty and Human Rights Watch have said that this method may even facilitate torture.
5. Abortion laws
The Spanish Senate passed a law last year that requires girls under 18 and women with mental disabilities to have a parent's permission before getting an abortion.
Amnesty reiterated concerns from the UN and other groups that Spain should instead ""ensure no legal barriers force women to resort to clandestine abortion, putting their lives and health at risk"".
6. Evictions

Evictions have been a major topic of discussion in Spain since the economic crisis hit the country particularly hard. More than 570,000 foreclosure procedures were launched between 2008 and 2014 and 52,350 new foreclosure cases were started within the first nine months of 2015.
Amnesty wrote that government measures meant to improve the situation were ""failing to ensure an effective remedy for those whose right to housing may have been infringed"".
Last summer, Amnesty launched an anti-eviction campaign in Spain."

""If you ask me what is my current biggest worry, I would say Spain,"" Frontex chief Fabrice Leggeri told Welt am Sonntag newspaper.
Data released by the International Organisation for Migration showed that migrants arriving in Spain numbered 6,513 for first six months of 2017.
In comparison, Leggeri said 6,000 irregular arrivals in Spain were recorded in June this year alone.
""If the numbers keep rising like they are now, then this route will become the most significant,"" said Leggeri.
Italy and Greece have until now recorded the biggest numbers of migrants crossing the Mediterranean to reach the European Union.
But with the route through Libya shutting down as the Libyan coast guard increases patrols, people smugglers are setting their sights westward.
IOM data showed that arrivals on the Spain coastline leapt almost three-fold from 2016 to around 22,000 in 2017.
Around half of the migrants are Moroccans, while others came from west African countries, said Leggeri.
EU member states last week reached a controversial plan to curb migrant and refugee arrivals from Africa and the Middle East.
The deal includes the creation of secure centres for migrants in the bloc, ""disembarkation platforms"" outside the EU and sharing out refugees among member states.
The accord came after Italy's new populist government pushed the issue to the forefront of the EU agenda by refusing to open the country's ports to migrant rescue ships."

In June Spain agreed to take in 630 migrants who arrived aboard three vessels, including the French NGO rescue ship Aquarius.
The Aquarius rescued the migrants off Libya's coast on June 9 but Italy's new populist government and Malta both refused to let it dock, triggering an international outcry before Spain stepped in to help.
Then on July 4th, a ship belonging to Spanish NGO Proactiva Open Arms docked in Barcelona with 60 migrants rescued off the Libyan coast on board after Italy refused to take them in.
Faced with growing tensions in the EU over the issue, member states struck a deal in late June to stem the arrival of migrants.
The accord includes the setting up of secure centres for migrants in EU countries and ""disembarkation platforms"" outside the bloc, as well as sharing out refugees among member states.
But the plan remains fraught with rows over how to divide responsibility for migrants and ease the stress on coastal countries such as Italy and Greece.
Italy, which had earlier vowed to turn away rescue boats, agreed Monday to continue accepting migrants picked up at sea, at least until the bloc finds a solution for sharing responsibility."

					14:10 CET+01:00				",Alex Dunham,Spanish Word of the Year highlights hatred of poor people ,"The recently coined term aporofobia, translated as a fear and repudiation of poor people, has been chosen as the word of 2017 for “giving a name to a palpable reality”.
Spain's prestigious language foundation Fundéu BBVA has chosen aporofobia as its word of the year, a title usually given to new or trending terms that influenced the language Spaniards used.
Previous winners include selfi (that's without an “e” at the end in Spanish), populism, refugee and escrache (a targeted demonstration outside the home or workplace of a public figure).
This year it's different, however.
“It's not a word that's been coined in 2017, nor is it one that's really known by the general public,” Fundeu's director general Joaquín Muller is quoted as saying in left-leaning online Spanish daily El Diario.
“But it's a voice, a neologism that we recommend here at Fundéu BBVA and that now the Royal Spanish Academy of language has decided to incorporate into its dictionaries.”
Fundéu BBVA credits Spanish philosopher Adela Cortina with coining and circulating aporofobia in the press to bring attention to the fact that xenophobia and racism are often used to explain the disdain shown towards migrants and refugees, when that aversion is often caused by their poverty status rather than for being foreign.
“It's important to name things that haven't been already to make them visible,” Muller adds.
“If they don't, those realities can't be defended or denounced.
“Unfortunately, aporofobia has been part of 2017's news, it's formed part of the migrant crisis, the widening rich-poor divide and the attitudes of some world leaders and a part of society towards these global trends.”
Aporofobia can be roughly translated into English as peniaphobia, a fear of poverty and poor people.
According to a 2015 OECD study, Spain had the fifth highest rate of inequality of the OECD countries in Europe, after the United Kingdom, Greece, Estonia and Portugal.
The economic crisis hit low-income Spaniards the hardest, according to the report, with the poorest 10 percent of the population losing 13 percent of their real incomes each year between 2007 and 2011. The top 10 percent, in comparison, lost 1.4 percent."

The woman who was rescued is a 40-year-old from Cameroon named Josepha. Proactiva said it transported her to Spain for her ""protection"" and to enable her to testify freely.
Italy had earlier offered to take in the woman but not the bodies.
Proactiva accuses Libyan coastguards of having saved the rest of the migrants on board the dinghy but not the two women and the child, whom they say refused to board the rescue vessel and go back to Libya.
The NGO alleges that as a result, the coastguards left them and deflated the dinghy. Rescuers let air out of migrants boats to stop them from being re-used and this boat had been slashed with a knife.

During the summer they patrolled the beaches of Catalonia, rushing into the waves to save hapless swimmers but when the hordes of tourists headed home a group of lifeguards decided to dedicate their lifesaving skills to refugees.
So in September they formed Pro-Activa Open Arms and headed to Lesbos, the Greek island that has been the epicentre of the refugee crisis as tens of thousands crammed into rubber dinghies to cross into Europe from Turkey.
Photo: Pro-Activa Open Arms
It was after seeing images of drowned refugees washing up on beaches, including that of three-year-old Syrian boy Aylan Kurdi, that the project came into being.
""Those images made us think, 'we are professionals in lifesaving and we could do something to help the refugees in Lesbos'. We have the skills and we have the equipment to do it so we took a desicion and just went,"" Oriol Canals from Badalona told The Local.
The group of lifeguards raised €15,000 ($17,000) between them, enough to stay for the month of September, and are now raising money to remain on Lesbos as weather conditions worsen and winter approaches.
""Our project is to try to help all the people arriving by boats reach the shore. When they get within 300 to 500 meters of land we can help them stay safe in the water and avoid drownings,"" Canals explained.
When the weather is fine and sea is calm, this could simply be helping people climb out of boats when they reach shallow water to avoid capsizing and then carrying those who can’t swim safely to shore.
""But with bad conditions we need to get into the water ourselves, to manoeuver the boat to the coast in the best way possible, sometimes the engines are not working and we have to drag them as we swim,"" said Canals, who explained the boats are often dangerously overloaded.
Each rescue has its own challenges but the emotional toll on the lifeguards can be hard to deal with, especially when they come up against the enormity of the help needed.
""Once we went out to the lighthouse near Skala just to get to know the coastline and while we there a boat arrived full of babies and young children,"" Canals said.
""It is an area very difficult to access and we were there just in one car with fifty people needing help. The mothers were pushing babies into our arms pleading 'Please take my baby and carry him to a safe place please',"" he recounted.
""In the end we managed to get hold of other volunteers and they came out with more cars and we were able to transport them all to the refugee camps.""
Map showing usual crossing route from Turkey to Lesbos: Pro-Activa Open Arms
Although the lifeguards have never come face to face with the traffickers they have heard talk of them and how they swindle desperate refugees out of their every penny with the promise of getting them safely into Europe.
""We talk with refugees to try to find out if there are more boats preparing to come over. And through that we have gleaned something about the process. The refugees are led to believe they will be in a safe boat with just ten people and for that they pay more than $1,000 per person.
""They are people who are just trying to escape war. They lost everything in their own countries and if they are 'lucky' they can escape because they have enough money to pay for a place on an illegal boat,"" he said.
""It isn’t just Syrians. We’ve met people from Syria, from Iraq, from Somalia, from Afghanistan.There are many people running away from different wars,"" he said.
""Most are like you and me… and having left everything they know behind them they are scared. They don’t know what comes next, who we are, where they have to go when they get to land. And that is just those who have the money to make the journey. Imagine what it happening to those left behind.""

Canals explains that there is little in the way of state help for the refugees and that the camps and services for refugees are all run by volunteers.
""We have to be prepared to see many hard things. This is about people, it is about the human race. It is trafficking in human lives and we see nothing being done to stop that by the EU or from Turkey.
""Everyday we see many people having to sleep on the ground, and it’s cold. Each one of the refugees risks their life. It’s crazy,"" he said.
The Pro-Activa Open Arms have launched a public appeal to raise money so they can continue their lifesaving work in Lesbos.

					09:12 CEST+02:00				",AFP,Spain poised to top Greece in migrant sea arrivals this year,"Spain could overtake Greece this year in the number of migrants arriving by sea, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) said last Thursday, coming shore on boats and even jet-skis.
Holidaymakers on a beach in southern Spain last week were stunned when a black rubber boat full of migrants reached the shore, its occupants jumping out and running away as scores of sun-worshippers looked on.
On the same day, 12 migrants arrived in waters off the Spanish territory of Ceuta in northern Morocco on jet skis, with one -- a 28-year-old man from Guinea -- drowning before he could be rescued, authorities said.
On Thursday morning, Spanish coastguards said they had rescued 10 men from sub-Saharan Africa in a rickety boat off Tarifa in southern Spain. And the list goes on.
Safer route
According to the IOM's latest figures, until August 6th, close to 8,200 migrants had arrived in Spain so far this year.
That is more than triple the number recorded at the same time last year, according to Joel Millman, a senior IOM spokesman, and already more than the total arrivals in 2016.
While the figure pales in comparison with Italy -- where more than 96,400 migrants have landed so far this year -- Spain is catching up with Greece where 11,713 alighted from boats in the same timeframe.
""It's possible that Spain will outperform Greece this year,"" Millman told AFP.
""If so, that's a big change.""
He said many people taking the long route towards Europe were from west African countries like Senegal, Gambia, Guinea or Ivory Coast.
But to get to Italy, they have to cross the Sahara desert and crucially Libya, wracked by chaos as rival militias and administrations seek to control the oil-rich country.
Faced with the danger, some may be deciding to go up along the coast instead.
""We assume that some of the change is due to the fact that the route is considered a safe route up to the coast through Morocco,"" Millman said.
He added that the boats crossing the choppy sea to Spain were much smaller than those launching from Libya to Italy.

In Libya there ""appears to be a very deliberate strategy to put people out there, in overloaded boats that begin to take on water almost immediately and then it's a race to see how quickly the people on the boat can summon aid,"" he said.

""Whereas in Spain, the strategy is smaller craft hoping to come in undetected, and undoubtedly some do.""
Pregnant women, kids
Spain's Guardia Civil police force said that nine of around 30 migrants who arrived on the beach on Wednesday had been found, all of them minors in their teens.
Spokesman Manuel Gonzalez told AFP that while they did not have any ID on them, they were thought to be from Morocco.
The teenagers will be taken to migrant reception centres, where they can apply for asylum in Spain.
Inigo Vila, in charge of emergencies for the Red Cross in Spain, said the organisation had reinforced the number of people working on the coast in southern Andalusia and in Ceuta to help migrants when they make landfall.
""Some people arrive with little strength left, sometimes they got lost, lost the engine, don't have anything to eat or drink in the boat, some have sunburns or burns from the petrol. And others are fine and recover quickly,"" he said.
""It's always surprising to see pregnant women and children -- even if there aren't many -- who try to cross in these conditions, risking their life and that of the kids for a better life.""
Land arrivals too
The number of sea arrivals, however, doesn't take into account those coming into Ceuta and Melilla, two Spanish territories in northern Morocco, by land.
Both cities are the EU's only land borders with Africa.

As a result, they are entry points for migrants who regularly try to climb high double border fences or force their way through them with wire cutters, or hide in vehicles crossing the frontier.
Faced with the number of recent entry attempts, authorities in Ceuta have decided to close the border for trade for over a week, to allow guards to better man the fence.

					11:51 CET+01:00				",Fiona Govan,How the number of Muslims in Spain is far lower than people think,"Spaniards massively overestimate the size of Spain’s Muslim population believing it to be seven times greater than it actually is, according to a new survey.
The Ipsos Mori survey ""Perils of Perception"" published on Wednesday reveals that Spanish people believe around 14 percent of the 47 million residents in Spain are Muslim, when in fact, the real figure is just 2.1 percent.
Spanish respondents also predicted that 21 percent of the population will be Muslim by 2020, but the same researchers predict the current number will rise to 3.3 percent (see graph below).
The survey revealed that the French were the most likely most likely to hold misconceptions about the Muslim population in their country. The survey showed that French people reckoned that 31 percent of the population was Muslim, when the real figure was 7.5 percent.
Meanwhile in Germany, which has seen a huge influx of refugees over the last year, people overestimate the number of Muslims four times over. The survey showed Germans believed Muslims make up 21 percent of the population - roughly 16 percentage points higher than the reality.
But when it comes to Spain, the figures cited in the survey prove to be flawed. The statistics used by researchers date from a report from the Pew Research Center, pubished in 2010.
Infact, by the end of 2015, the number of Muslims resident in Spain numbered 1.887.906 according to the Islamic Commission of Spain, representing 4 percent of the population.
The data revealed that 41 percent of the Muslims in Spain are of Spanish nationality while 59 percent were immigrants. Of all Muslims in Spain, 40 percent hold Moroccan passports and 19 percent were from other countries, with the second largest group from Pakistan, followed by Senegal.
Last year Spain agreed to take 15,000 refugees from overwhelmed Greece and Italy under an EU distribution plan, but has so far only welcomed around 800 and is routinely criticised by human rights groups of its treatment of migrants and asylum seekers.
In a recent survey by Amnesty, Spaniards proved to be the most accepting of refugees.
An astounding 97 percent of Spanish respondents said that yes, they would ""personally accept people fleeing war or persecution"" into their country, according to a survey by Amnesty International."

					10:16 CET+01:00				", The Local,"Record-breaking 13,000 asylum seekers arrive in Spain in 2015","A record 13,000 asylum seekers were expected to arrive in Spain in 2015 but that figure is still less than 1 percent of the European Union total.
As of mid-December, Spain had received some 12,500 applications for asylum, with that figure expected to surpass 13,000 by the end of the year.
That figure is more than twice the 2014 number of 5,895.
The majority of the new arrivals, around 7,0000, were Syrians arriving in Spain's North African enclave of Melilla, according to the UN's refugee agency UNHCR.
But the figure for the number of asylum seekers arriving in Spain was less than one percent of the total for the European Union.
Germany officially hit the one-million mark in early December while Sweden, a country with a far smaller population than Spain was expecting 190,000 new arrivals in 2015.
After initially refusing to accept a mandatory quota agreement from the EU, Spain's government said in early September that it would accept 14,931 refugees bowing to public pressure within Spain that the nation should shoulder its share of the burden.
Public campaigns were launched across Spain calling on the government to accept more refugees and hundreds of councils have measures in place to welcome refugees risking their lives to reach Europe.
The first group – just a dozen people relocated from Italy- arrived in Madrid in November.
In related news, the number of people arriving via boat on the shores of Andalusia was steady, with 3,149 people arriving in this fashion in 2015 against 3,170 last year.
In the Canary Islands, however, the number of migrants arriving by sea soared from 288 in 2014 to 844 this year.
Over one million migrants and refugees crossed the Mediterranean Sea to Europe in 2015, nearly half of them Syrians, the UN refugee agency (UNHCR) said Wednesday.
The milestone marks an almost five-fold increase over 2014 figures, whenthe UNHCR recorded 219,000 arrivals via the perilous sea crossing.
The figures underscore the enormous impact that Syria's nearly five-yearcivil war has had on changing migration patterns.
The conflict has forced more than four million people to flee the country,but until this year, an overwhelming majority of them were spread among Syria's neighbours.
While Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey continue to host massive numbers ofSyrians displaced by war, the UN figures show that beginning in the spring increasingly large numbers of Syrians resolved to reach Europe.

Osama Abdul Mohsen, who was a coach for first division team Al-Fotuwa, left Munich by train on Wednesday morning and is due to arrive in Madrid at around midnight with two of his sons.
The president of Cenafe Miguel Ángel Galán, made contact with the Syrian football coach after seeing his plight in the Spanish media.
""When we saw the story of Mohsen published in the newspapers we felt very bad about it,"" Galán told El País.
He managed to contact the father and son via a Spanish journalist and offered to bring them to Spain, according to a statement released by Cenafe.
""We are a centre for coaches and we like to help everyone who works in this area,"" Cenafe director Conrado Galán told El País.

An Arabic-speaking student from Cenafe, Mohamed Labrouzi, met the father and his two sons in Munich, and the four boarded a train heading for Madrid on Wednesday morning.
Mohsen’s wife and two other children are currently still in Turkey, but Cenafe has said it will try to bring them to Spain to reunite the family as soon as possible.
Cenafe have a flat ready for the Syrian football coach in Getafe, a city just to the south of Madrid, paid for from its advertising budget.
""As soon as he learns Spanish, we plan to offer him a job at our organization,"" Cenafe president Miguel Ángel Galán said.
Sara Hernández, mayor of Getafe, confirmed to Spanish media that Mohsen would work with the city’s football club, Getafe FC:
""We will work with Getafe FC so that the father can coach there, seeing as he has experience in that area,"" she confirmed during a press conference on Wednesday.
""This is a step to show the solidarity of the city of Getafe in response to this human drama,"" she added."

					14:41 CEST+02:00				",AFP,France to take some migrants from Aquarius rescue ship,"Madrid said Saturday it has accepted an offer from France to take in migrants from the Aquarius rescue ship following a turbulent week surrounding the stricken vessel.
The boat, which is due to arrive in Spain on Sunday morning with more than 600 people on board, has been the heart of a major migration row between European Union member states.
""The French government will work together with the Spanish government to handle the arrival of the migrants"", Spain's deputy prime minister Carmen Calvo said in a statement.
""France will accept migrants who express the wish to go there"" once they have been processed in Valencia, the statement said.
Chartered by a French aid group, the vessel rescued 629 migrants including many children and pregnant women off Libya's cost last weekend. Doctors Without Borders (MSF), who along with French charity SOS Mediterranée are treating migrants on board Aquarius, said two passengers drowned last weekend when the ship first encountered difficulties off Libya.
The passengers come from 26 countries, mainly from Africa but also Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan, according to MSF.
Among them are 450 adult men and 80 women -- including at least seven pregnant women -- as well as 11 under-13s and 93 adolescents, according to the latest figures released by authorities in Valencia.
A team of 2,320 people has been mobilised to meet them, including 1,000 Red Cross volunteers and 470 translators.
Refused entry
Italy's new populist government and Malta refused to let Aquarius dock in their ports, accusing each other of failing to meet their humanitarian and EU commitments.
Spain eventually stepped in and agreed to receive the refugees. France -- who had angered Rome by branding it irresponsible over the vessel rejection -- offered Thursday to welcome Aquarius migrants who ""meet the criteria for asylum"".
The ship is making the 1,500-kilometre (930-mile) voyage to Spain accompanied by Italian coast guard vessels, which have taken on board some of the migrants.
High waves and winds forced the convoy to take a detour on the way, but the first migrants are expected to land in Valencia between 6am (0800 GMT) and 12pm (1400 GMT) on Sunday.
EU divisions
The plight of the Aquarius has again highlighted the failure of EU member states to work together to deal with the influx of migrant arrivals since 2015. After Rome's decision to ban the Aquarius, French President Emmanuel Macron and Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte met on Friday and agreed that the EU should set up asylum processing centres in Africa to prevent ""voyages of death.""
They also demanded ""profound"" changes to the EU's asylum rules which put the migrant burden on their port of entry to Europe -- mainly Italy and Greece.
Italy's far-right Interior Minister Matteo Salvini warned Saturday that other NGO operated rescue ships would also be banned from docking.
""While the Aquarius is sailing towards Spain, two other Dutch NGO operated vessels (Lifeline and Seefuchs) have arrived off the Libyan coast, to wait for their human cargos once the people smugglers abandon them,"" Salvini said in a Facebook post.
""These people should know that Italy no longer wants to be any part of this business of clandestine immigration and they will have to look for other ports to go to,"" he said.
""As minister and as a father, I take this action for the benefit of all,"" he added."
