					08:57 CEST+02:00				",The Local,The forgotten refugee camp in northern France,"As the “New Jungle” at Calais reaches breaking point with the number of refugees hitting 6,000, many refugees now head to other camps in northern France. The Local reports from a squalid settlement near Dunkirk whose population has exploded but the aid has not followed.
A muddy clearing in a wood, bordered on one side by the motorway leading to the ferry ports of Dunkirk and Calais and on the other by neat streets of suburban houses, is now home for Dlir Kader and his family.
The Kurd arrived at the camp in Grande-Synthe, on the outskirts of Dunkirk, this month along with his wife and four children - the youngest is his seven month-old daughter - after fleeing northern Iraq when the Islamic State (Isis) took control of his town.
The family sit in the drizzle around a small fire where they cook dinner next to the ragged tents that do little to protect them from the elements.
Like most people in this camp of between 800 and 1,000 people - most of the them Kurds - they want to go to Britain.
“Germany (which has a far more welcoming attitude to migrants than Britain) is no good for us. The language is too hard and we don’t have any relations there, like we do in England,” said Kader.

But he said that after their long trip through Turkey, Greece and the Balkans, they had no money left to pay the people smugglers who hang around the camp and who charge hundreds and sometimes thousands of euros for help in sneaking into the back of a lorry on its way to Britain.
The settlement in Grande-Synthe has existed since 2006 but for years had fewer than 100 migrants. Since September its population has exploded.
The people smugglers decided to move some of their clients to less congested spots as Calais become over-crowded and after security at the ferry port and the Eurotunnel terminal was boosted after chaotic scenes this summer that saw hundreds of migrants try nightly to clamber onto trains heading to England.
Another camp in Téteghem, on the other side of Dunkirk, now houses around 500 migrants.

In another camp further inland, 300 migrants, most of them Eritreans, live in equally insalubrious conditions as they wait for their chance to get to the UK.
Other smaller camps, some with just a few dozen migrants, are dotted along the motorways leading to the coast.
""We were heading to Calais with an aid convoy but aid groups there told us to come to Grande-Synthe instead because they are getting so little help,"" Joby Andrews, from Bristol in England, as he prepared to leave the town to catch the ferry back to the UK.

He and a group of friends have set up what they call the Aid Box Convoy and earlier this month arrived in Grande-Synthe with eight vans and trailers loaded with aid.
The boxes they distributed to camp dwellers - each containing a stove, solid fuel, rice, tins of food, toiletries and a wind-up torch - were snapped up by the migrants, who also include a small group of Vietnamese nationals.
The local authorities have provided half a dozen prefabs equipped with showers and toilets, and say they will soon set up large, sturdy tents to provide better accommodation for the migrants.

But for the moment conditions in the camp are squalid and will worsen as the winter sets in.
Hundreds of tents are grouped around a large open space in the middle of the clearing, where a rickety goal post provides the only entertainment for the handful of children who live here.
The migrants cook on campfires or wait for warm meals that local residents bring in on an ad hoc basis.
Aid groups and doctors do make occasional visits but there is no organised structure to deal with the recent massive rise in the population.

""We were set up here to help around 100 people but we are dealing with over 800,"" said Sylvie Cousin, of the Salam charity which is also present in the so-called “New Jungle” in Calais, which lies about 40 kilometres to the west.
Local residents are largely sympathetic to the plight of the migrants, but some are worried by the presence of hundreds of men living rough just yards from their front doors.
They have sent a petition to the town mayor calling for action to stop the “intrusions into gardens, verbal aggression, gunfire, knife fights, noise night and day, and rummaging in bins” that they say is happening in their previously peaceful area.
Yet many of the migrants say they feel much safer here than in the Calais “New Jungle,” where fights often break out between the different ethnic groups living there.
For Dlir Kader, the Iraqi Kurd in Grande-Synthe with his family, the camp will do for the moment. But he is desperate to get to England one way or another as soon as he can.
“We can’t survive here in the winter,” he said.

					12:33 CEST+02:00				",AFP/The Local,France vows 'no new refugee centre in Calais' as migrants say conditions are worse than ever,"Despite the fact hundreds of refugees and migrants are living in Calais in desperate conditions the French government has vowed there will be no new welcome centre built. Instead security will be reinforced.
French President Emmanuel Macron's new government took a tough line on Calais migrants Friday, with his interior
minister saying he does not want the northern port to become an ""abscess"".
Making his first visit to a city which has for years been a magnet for migrants and refugees hoping to cross to Britain, Interior Minister Gerard Collomb (see pic below) ruled out building a reception centre for asylum-seekers in Calais, saying it would only encourage more people to come.
""We've seen this before, it starts with a few hundred people and ends with several thousand people who we can't manage,"" Collomb said as he met with security forces, officials and aid workers in Calais.
""That's why we don't want a centre here.""
Instead, Collomb said, ""we are going to reinforce security with the arrival of two additional mobile security force units to stop any new camps from forming.""
Authorities shut down the notorious ""Jungle"" camp in Calais, which at its height was home to some 10,000 people living in dire conditions, last October.

But hundreds of migrants -- mostly Afghans, Sudanese and Eritreans -- are still at the port, clashing sporadically with police as they try every night to stow away onto trucks heading to Britain.
This week a Polish driver was killed when his truck burst into flames after hitting a roadblock, set up by migrants hoping to slow the traffic to make it easier to jump onto vehicles.
The roadblocks began reappearing in late May with a new uptick of migrants in the region -- and a surge for Europe, with Italy registering more than 65,000 arrivals since January.
While the tent city of the Jungle is gone, migrants say conditions in Calais are bleaker than ever.
""There is no tap and we cannot drink, we cannot wash. There is nowhere to sleep. At night I sleep without a tent on the 'mountain',"" said Jamal, a 24-year-old Afghan, pointing to a huge rubbish dump.
'They are not dirt'
Collomb pledged Friday to present Macron with a plan for asylum reforms in the next two weeks, vowing in particular to tackle African people-smuggling networks at their root.
Eleven charities went to court on Wednesday demanding the construction of a government refugee centre in Calais, deploring the miserable conditions in which migrants find themselves.
Collomb had angered aid groups with comments Thursday rejecting the proposal, saying that building such a centre would be like creating an artificial festering ""abcess"" that would keep growing.
""These people are not a disease, they are not dirt. They are men and women who have made a very difficult journey to flee their countries for reasons we all know about,"" said Hicham Aly, an aid worker at the Secours Catholique charity.
Collomb argued that past experience showed that any official asylum facility in Calais would quickly overflow with arrivals, leaving authorities unable to cope.
""I'm suspicious of centres that are supposedly ready to welcome migrants for only a few days who end up staying for a long time,"" he said.
He pointed to Sangatte near Calais, where a refugee centre that opened in 1999 quickly ran over its capacity of 800 residents. By the time it closed three years later, some 2,000 people were crammed into it."

					15:01 CEST+02:00				",The Local/AFP,France won't open arms to refugees like Germany,"Despite President Hollande's pledge to take in 24,000 refugees, France is unlikely to offer the same kind and size of welcome Germany has afforded refugees, for both historical and economic reasons.
While refugees were applauded upon arrival at Munich rail station at the weekend it was business as usual on the French–Italian border.
Although Germany has basically scrapped EU rules and opened its doors to refugees travelling through Europe, France continues to send them back to Italy.
The French president vowed on Monday to take in thousands of refugees but on the Italian border police said they are sending up to 200 refugees and migrants back to Italy each day, in line with the Dublin accords that state refugees must seek asylum in the EU country of arrival.
“This changes nothing,” said Philippe Castanet from the town of Grasse in France's southern region of Provence, referring to Hollande’s call for binding refugee quotas. He vowed to turn back any foreigner who wasn’t holding the necessary papers.
It wasn’t the only contrast between France and Germany’s stance towards the ever-growing refugee crisis in Europe.
On Monday, Germany announced that extra housing would be built to accommodate refugees. There would also be language training and extra police, paid for out of an extra €6 billion that will be spent on dealing with the crisis.
Back in France a new tented camp will be built for migrants in Calais — but paid for with EU money.
Merkel has been unafraid to tell it how it is when it comes to a subject the governments of Britain and France are often desperate to avoid.
On Monday, she said that the “breathtaking” influx of refugees would “change” Germany in the years to come. It is hard to imagine Hollande daring to say those words, knowing they would be seized on by his right-wing opponents.
Public opinion in the eurozone’s two biggest powers also appears to diverge.
While opinion polls in Germany suggest people are largely in favour of accepting refugees, a poll in France published at the weekend revealed a majority of the public were against adopting Germany’s open borders policy — despite what the presence of 10,000 people at a pro-refugee demonstration in Paris on Saturday might suggest.
And it's not just people in the two neighbouring countries who differ in their stance towards refugees either. So too do some of the local authorities tasked with welcoming those fleeing war-torn countries.
While the mayor of Munich said his only concern was providing a safe haven for refugees, a mayor in France spoke out on Monday claiming he was only willing to accept Christian asylum seekers, out of fear that Islamist terrorists might sneak through disguised as Muslim refugees.
Hollande is keen to be seen standing side by side with Merkel, who has won plaudits for opening her arms to refugees .
""We cannot leave Germany alone to take on this responsibility,"" Hollande said on Monday.
But despite his vow, France is unlikely to show the same kind of sympathy towards refugees and migrants as Germany has, for a number of reasons explains Jerôme Fourquet, a political analyst and pollster from Ifop .
Essentially the two countries face contrasting political and economic challenges, as well as levels of fears of Islamist terror attacks, that can account for the diverging stances towards refugees.
Differing economic fortunes
“One country is prospering and healthy, and the other is in the middle of an economic crisis,"" Fourquet tells The Local.
“In Germany unemployment stands at 5 percent and there are whole sectors where they are in need of workers. But in France we have ten percent unemployment and it's not falling.""
Fourquet also points out the difference in public finances between the two countries with spending balanced in Germany, unlike in France where the deficit is significant and the politicians talk of the need to balance books.
Different demographics
“German society is conscious of the fact that they need to find young foreigners to come and keep the economic machine working and pay for the pensions of older generation, Fourquet says.
“In Germany you have different company bosses who say they are ready to take on apprentices and trainees from the migrant population because we will need to have them in the coming years. You don’t have this kind of political discourse in France,"" he adds.
“Here the birth-rate is not exactly flourishing but it is much more dynamic than Germany’s and more capable of renewing the generations.
""Yet France is struggling to find work for its young people, with youth unemployment in the country standing at around 25 percent.
""For a few years now in France, economic growth has not been enough to absorb young French people into the workforce. We are not creating enough jobs to absorb this demographic growth,"" he said.
Historic reasons
There are also significant differences between the two countries' recent histories that have played a roll.
""In Germany they have a past that weighs heavy on the country, regarding national identity and the rejection of foreigners, Fourquet says.
""There is not this taboo in France.""
Germany also has a much more recent history of accepting large numbers of refugees and economic migrants, who fled the old Soviet bloc or moved on mass from east to west Germany after reunification.
And while France has its own tradition of welcoming thousands of refugees, notably the Vietnamese boat people and Algerians fleeing war, this has not been the case in recent years.
The Islam factor
France is home to Europe's biggest Muslim population and the question of the role of Islam in French society has never been more important since January's Islamist terror attacks shocked the nation.
Although Germany has seen its own anti-Islam marches in Dresden, it has not experienced the terror that France did during three days in January.
""These refugees come from Islamic country at war, a fact which weighs on public opinion in France,"" Fourquet says.
A poll published at the weekend revealed that 56 percent of French people interviewed believed that terrorists may be among the thousands of refugees heading into Europe.
The role of the far right
It’s this kind of fear that Marine Le Pen’s far-right Front National has helped to stoke in recent months.
Her party continues to ride the crest of a wave, with yet another poll on Monday suggesting she would make it to a second round vote in the 2017 presidential elections, knocking Hollande out of the running.
Fourquet says it’s not a coincidence that a country like Germany, where there is no strong far-right party, has been more welcoming to refugees.
How will things change?
But as reaction to the publication of the photo of the drowned Syrian boy shows, public opinion, and indeed government policy, towards the refugee crisis can change swiftly.
“Certainly the polls show that French people are less reluctant to accept refugees than before the summer, but even then we still have around 50 percent of people opposed to welcoming refugees, despite all the calls to take in more and the increased emotion,"" Fourquet says.
But things could also change in Germany.
""If next year another 800,000 asylum seekers come into Germany, we cannot be sure there will be the same reaction,"" the pollster warns."

					13:00 CET+01:00				",The Local/AFP,France opens its first respectable refugee camp,"France opened its first-ever refugee camp to meet international humanitarian standards on Monday, after coming under pressure for its treatment, or lack of it, of thousands of refugees.
If the Jungle refugee camp in Calais was described as the ""worst in Europe"" the one up the road at the Grande Synthe near Dunkirk, was said to be even worse.
The camp, located in woodland outside the port of Dunkirk, was home to over 1,000 mainly Iraqi-Kurd refugees, who eked out an existence amid the mud and miserable conditions.
Up until now they had to make do with tents or ramshackle huts, much to the anger of international aid groups who lined up to blast the French government for allowing refugees to live in worse conditions from those which they had fled (pics below).
But on Monday the town of Grande-Synthe opened France's first-ever refugee camp to meet international humanitarian standards, despite official opposition from the government.
""It's a great day for human solidarity,"" said local mayor Damien Careme, who fought a battle with the authorities.
""I've overcome a failure of the state,"" he said, adding that he could no longer stand the sight of around 75 children living in the original camp.
However the government's local representative, prefect Jean-Francois Cordet, late Monday raised safety concerns that could halt operations.
Cordet had ""ordered the mayor of Grande-Synthe to immediately cancel the municipal bylaw"" which authorised the opening of the camp against the advice of the municipal safety commission, he said in a statement.
He ordered Careme to ""without delay take measures to ensure the safety of the occupants, especially at night"" to limit the risk of fire.
""The safety of people is at stake and one cannot disregard the rules, whatever the humanitarian motives,"" Cordet said.
Three families of Iraqi Kurds were the first to arrive at the new camp after being moved from the squalid camp nearby.
Doctors Without Borders (MSF) has so far built a little over 200 of 275 planned cabins at the site to house at least 1,500 people -- many of whom are fleeing the demolition in Calais.
MSF say they eventually hope to house 2,500 refugees in 375 cabins.
The camp also has proper showers and toilets.
According to Le Point news site, it was built at a cost of €3.1 million and will be run by the charity Utopia.56. The town is hoping that the government will agree to foot the bill.
The move has frustrated the government which has been trying to move refugees away from the northern coast and into centres where their movement is more controlled.
The government's representative in northern France, Jean-Francois Cordet, said last month: ""The government's policy is not to reconstitute a camp at Grande-Synthe, but to make it go away."""

					16:40 CET+01:00				",Oliver Gee,Why this refugee camp is scaring 'posh' Parisians,"Authorities in Paris gave the green light on Wednesday to erect temporary homes for 200 refugees and homeless people in the posh 16th arrondissement of the city, despite anger from local residents.
The 16th arrondissement of Paris is one of the most affluent in the city, made up of wide avenues with tree-lined walkways, enormous homes, and prestigious schools.
And soon - it will also boast a set of five temporary homes for a population of around 200 migrants and homeless people, according to reports on France Bleu radio.
The structures will be erected ""within weeks"" in an unused grassy area just off the Avenue du Maréchal Maunoury, which is across the peripherique ring road from the Bois de Boulogne - the second biggest park in Paris.
The homes will be managed by French non-profit organization Aurore, which houses around 20,000 people in France each year.
The shelter will be on the west side of Paris in the 16th arrondissement. Photo: GoogleMaps
But not everyone is excited about the project. Over 50,000 local residents signed a petition to block the move, a protest backed by the centre right-wing deputy mayor of the arrondissement, Claude Goasguen.
He wrote on his blog that the Bois de Boulogne park was destined to become ""a new Sangatte"", referring to the controversial refugee camp on the northern French coastline that saw riots when it was closed by authorities in 2002.
He also pointed out how France's prime minister had already warned that terrorists were taking advantage of the migrant crisis to return to France.
A real estate agent called Michel who works in the area said such a move was ""risky"".
""This is a posh district that's very wealthy,"" he told France Bleu.
""There are beautiful cars, apartments with luxurious furnishings and jewellery inside. I'm not saying that these people are thieves, far from it, but when a pot of honey is put next to you, you want to stick your finger in it. It's tempting fate.""
Nevertheless, Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo pointed out that all the 20 arrondissements needed to pull their weight, and that the 16th currently wasn't.
The buildings are scheduled to be erected in the coming weeks and are planned to remain for five years. However, the project could still be scuppered by Environmental Minister Ségolène Royal, who is yet to look at the proposal."

					10:30 CEST+02:00				",The Local,'Airbnb for refugees' comes to Paris,"A pro-refugee organization in Paris has launched a new project that will allow French locals to open up their homes to refugees. And Parisians appear to be taking to it.
It can be hard enough for Parisians themselves to find a place to live the French capital.
But imagine how tough it would be for someone who's just been granted refugee status, can't speak French, and hasn't got their own network to help.
This is a problem that's being tackled by Singa, an organization which has spent the past two years helping refugees adapt to life in France.
The group has recently created a new ""room-finding"" programme called Calm (Comme a la maison), in the hopes of connecting refugees with volunteers who have space in their homes.
With the issue of refugees the hottest political issue of the moment, organizers have said that it's about time something was done to address the issue.
""Today there is a real awakening of civil society on this issue,"" co-founder Nathanaël Molle said. ""We can't just stand by anymore.""
Since launching a few days ago, around 200 people have already registered their interest in housing a refugee, the group's co-founder Molle told the AFP news agency.
It's inspired by a similar scheme that was set up in Berlin under the title Refugees Welcome and was dubbed ""Airbnb for refugees"" after the popular holiday home-sharing site.
The website of the new French version asks: Do you have a spare room in your apartment? Then host a refugee!
""We have all kinds of families among those registered: farmers, bankers, people who live in the countryside, others in towns,"" added Alice Barbe, another co-founder.
Barbe said that the move would allow refugees ""to understand the society they are in, to meet French people, and to be able to relax during a period of stress and anxiety"".
(Do you have a spare room in your apartment? Then host a refugee!)
So how does it all work?
Refugees can submit a form online that asks for some basic details, as well as where they'd like to live.
Volunteers can fill out another form detailing their available room, the home it is inside, and the area they live in, and even information about their hobbies.
Singa then correlates the information to find suitable matches - and have said that the first housing will take place within the next two weeks.
And similarly to Airbnb, the homeowners are in charge of how long their guest can stay, which can be anything from a month to one year. The organization notes that the contract can be cut short if things don't work out."

Macron said on Monday that Putin had promised ""the whole truth"".

""President Putin told me... he had undertaken several initiatives on the subject of LGBT people in Chechnya with measures aimed at establishing the whole truth about the activities of local authorities,"" Macron said at a press conference with Putin after talks in Versailles.
""I spelled out France's expectations very precisely,"" Macron said, adding that he would be ""vigilant"" on the issue and that the two leaders had agreed to review the situation regularly.
Russian newspaper Novaya Gazeta reported in March that authorities in Muslim-majority Chechnya were imprisoning and torturing gay men.
It said that over 100 gays had been arrested in the region, where homosexuality is taboo, and that their families have been told to kill them to ""cleanse their honour"".
The paper said at least two had been killed by relatives and a third died after being tortured.
Earlier this month Putin backed an official probe into the reported attacks after German Chancellor Angela Merkel confronted him on the issue during a visit to Moscow.
But SOS Homophobie dismissed Putin's claims of an investigation into the 'LGBT purge' in Chechnya.
""We hear Mr Putin say that he has launched an investigation, that it is not true and that there are no crimes against homosexuals, which is totally false,"" said the organisation's leader Joël Deumier.
""We can no longer accept this discourse of negation by Russia against homosexuals.""
Coinciding with Putin's visit to France on Monday, two gay couples unfurled a banner reading ""End Homophobia in Chechnya"" and kissed with the Eiffel Tower in the background."

The 33-year-old man, referred to as Ahmed H, is accused of having participated in the June 2014 capture and execution of an estimated 1,700 young, mainly Shiite army recruits from the Speicher military camp to the north of Tikrit.
Ahmed H was arrested in March and indicted days later on a range of charges including ""killings in connection with a terrorist group"" and ""war crimes"", and placed in pre-trial detention, the Paris prosecutor said.
The case highlights fears by Western intelligence agencies that jihadists have been able to take advantage of the migrant crisis to enter Europe.
Having arrived in France in the summer of 2016 Ahmed H obtained refugee status a year later and was given a 10-year resident card, a source close to the investigation told AFP on Thursday.
Shortly after being granted his refugee status, Ahmed H was identified and followed by intelligence services, who then notified judicial authorities.
According to a source close to the investigation, Ahmed H has denied any involvement.
French authorities have revoked his protected status since his incarceration.
His lawyer Mohamed El Monsaf Hamdi did not want to comment immediately when contacted by AFP.
The Camp Speicher massacre was considered one of IS's worst crimes after it took over large parts of Iraq in 2014.
One of the sites of the massacre was the former river police building inside former president Saddam Hussein's palace complex in Tikrit.
Video footage subsequently released by IS showed an assembly-line massacre in which gunmen herded their victims towards the quay, shot them in the back of the head and pushed them in the water one after the other."

France will cut processing time for asylum requests and boost housing for refugees while ""systematically"" deporting illegal economic migrants, Prime Minister Edouard Philippe said Wednesday.
Unveiling an ""action plan"" for dealing with tens of thousands of people who arrive in France each year, Philippe said it aimed to ""guarantee the right to asylum (and) better handle migratory flows.""
France, which received 85,000 asylum requests last year, is grappling with a system that President Emmanuel Macron has described as ""completely overwhelmed"".
France has come under harsh criticism from charities for failing to provide adequate facilities for refugees, leading to the formation of squalid camps in northern France and around Paris.
An aid worker who took part in a meeting at the interior ministry on the issue last week said he feared a ""general hardening of expulsion measures"" in the plan announced Wednesday.
""We are not what France should be"" in striking a balance between humanitarian concern for refugees and observing a tough policy on handling economic migrants, Philippe said.
Philippe's announcements came after the mayor of Grand-Synthe, near the northern port of Dunkirk tweeted photos of the migrant children living in desperate conditions in the refugee camp in his town in a bid to pressure the French president to take action.
Damien Careme posted photos on Twitter, taken by the charity Help4Refugee Children showing children surrounded by mud and rubbish to highlight the terrible conditions of the camp which he said he could no longer tolerate.

Philippe said 40 percent of asylum seekers and refugees do not have access to housing, and that the current 80,000 homes and shelters would be increased by 12,500 in 2018 and 2019.
He said the plan calls for additional resources to allow authorities to reduce processing time for an asylum application from 14 months to six.
Philippe said those who are denied asylum will be ""systematically"" deported, adding that the legal framework for their detention pending deportation would be ""redefined"" as part of a draft law to be introduced in September.
""We must make economic migrants understand that it won't be possible to take in all economic migrants,"" he said.
He said France would beef up means for integrating refugees such as language teaching, something Macron, elected in May, listed as a priority during his campaign.
Philippe also announced the creation of an inter-ministerial coordinator for integrating refugees into French society -- a key demand of Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo.
Last Thursday, EU interior ministers pledged to back a plan to help Italy, which has seen some 85,000 migrants stream into the country since the start of the year."

""For the first time in seven years I feel safe,"" said one of the group, a 59-year-old who gave his name as Nasser, as he stepped off the plane from Lebanon at Charles de Gaulle airport to applause from families and activists who had come to welcome them.
""In seven years I have never felt peace like today,"" said Nasser, who is originally from Homs and had been a refugee in Lebanon since 2013.
He is due to resettle in the southwestern French city of Pau with his wife, their son and their daughter, who is wheelchair-bound.
A total of 500 refugees are due to be resettled across France by 2018 under a deal signed between the French state and five Christian organisations in March.
The Christian groups will finance the hosting of the refugees, with the state granting them visas and refugee status.
Isabelle Yard, a 57-year-old teacher, said she was ""extremely moved"" to be greeting Iraqi couple Raphi, Racha and their 15-year-old daughter Perla to take them home to her village, Combas, in southern France.
She added she was ""a little worried"" too, hoping that the family ""will not be disappointed"" as the village, home to 600 people, is rather isolated.
A group of 50 residents has mobilised to welcome the family and has been preparing for months, she said.
""Some give money, others give time. A couple have made their house available,"" Yard said.
Francois Clavairoly, head of the French Protestant federation, said the hosts had pledged to feed and house the refugees but also help to integrate them ""legally and culturally"".
France is the second country in Europe to institute a ""humanitarian corridor"" scheme of this kind, after Italy."

					11:09 CET+01:00				",Oliver Gee,Calais refugee camp hit by another blaze,"Photos have emerged from a fire that swept through the New Jungle migrant camp in Calais, injuring two and burning down numerous tents over 250 square metres. The blaze marks the third at the camp in under a month.
The fire broke out in the early hours of Sunday morning in the camp, which is home to an estimated 6,000 refugees hoping to cross the Channel to the UK.
Two Eritrean migrants - a 25-year-old woman and a 28-year-old man - were injured in the blaze, which burned down an area of 250 square metres, authorities said.
Leilah Kessler, a volunteer from the UK who was helping out in the camp at the time of the blaze, said there was a mood of fear and horror at the time.
""I was sleeping nearby in a shelter of an Eritrean friend, we were awoken by people banging on shelters and shouting to wake everyone up,"" she told The Local.
""People were taking all their possessions and they were scared, particularly those with children.""
""The smell was horrific.""
She said that while those near to the blaze were in panic and fear, there was ""definitely a sense of 'here we go again'"" by others.
The fire is understood to have started in a makeshift kitchen at around 2am, burning through the camp due to strong winds.
According to Marc del Grande, the secretary-general of the local authority or Pas-de-Calais refugees on the scene threw stones at the firefighters who came to extinguish the blaze,
Volunteer Kessler said that police and ambulances did not enter the camp, only the firefighters, who arrived around 45 minutes after the blaze broke out.
She said all that remained the next day was ""a smoldering waste and the little belongings anyone had"".
The fire marks the third at the camp in less than a month.
The night after the Paris terror attacks, another blaze spread across 2,500 square metres of the camp, though no one was injured.
A firefighter confirmed soon after that the fire was in no way connected with the terror attacks and had been sparked by an electrical fault.
In early November, video images emerged showing a huge blaze at the camp, which prompted an explosion that sent people fleeing in panic. See the video from the explosion below.
The fires will no doubt add a sense of insecurity for the migrants, who several NGOs have said in recent months are living in such squalor that it is a violation of human rights.
France was put under additional pressure on Monday to fix the problem, with the country's top administrative court backing an order that forces the French government to improve conditions.
Tensions, meanwhile, remain high in the Calais camp, with refugees and police clashing several times this month.
In desperate efforts to smuggle themselves into vehicles heading to the UK, police claim migrants have been repeatedly placing objects on the roads, leaving police to resort to force in an effort to clear the highways.
Witnesses and police say some refugees hurled stones at police, who responded with tear gas.
Aid groups have also regularly accused the riot police of brutality and overreaction when clashing with the camp's inhabitants.

					13:17 CEST+02:00				",The Local,Paris police crack down on fake Syrian refugee beggars,"Beggars in Paris are posing as Syrian refugees in the hope of getting sympathy and spare change from the public.
Over the last year, an increasing number of men, women, and children are seen begging for change on the sides of the main roads entering Paris, particularly in the north of the city.
Many hold signs reading “Syrian Family” and “SOS Syrians"" as they slalom between several lanes of traffic at all hours of the night and day.
Motorists are forced to drive carefully to avoid mothers carrying babies who often have several children in tow.
Numerous beggars on the Paris Metro have also held similar signs in a bid to solicit a little more sympathy and spare change given the crisis in the Middle East country.
While some of these men, women and children are indeed Syrian, the vast majority, according to French police, are from Eastern European countries such as Romania.
Locals in the neighbourhoods on the edge of north eastern Paris have raised concerns.

“Even at night. It’s a miracle there aren’t more accidents, especially in areas with heavy traffic.”
Since the spring however, local police have organized operations to crack down on the begging.
The most recent, at Porte de Pantin in the 19th arrondissement, led to the arrest of five adults - only one of which was Syrian, the rest Romanian - after a child ran into the street and was hit by a car while local officials were patrolling the area.
“Romanians arrested at the gates of the capital all admit that they try to pass as Syrians for money reasons,” a police source told Le Parisien newspaper."

					17:15 CEST+02:00				",Ben McPartland,Refugees offer chance to boost French economy,"Many economic and migration experts say refugees and migrants will benefit the French economy while some say France should be extremely worried that more of those fleeing the Middle East don’t want to come.
France and other European nations overwhelmed by the biggest refugee crisis since World War II may end up boosting their economies if they just let the migrants in, analysts say.
More than 430,000 people have crossed the Mediterranean to Europe so far this year, but only a few thousand of them are heading to France, with most it seems preferring to go to Germany, Sweden or the UK.
However France has said it will take in 24,000 refugees over the coming two years on top of the 6,000 or so who are thought to be currently in the country.
While many in France, both politicians and public, fret about the idea of so many new arrivals and the immediate strain it will put on the state, experts on immigration are quick to point to the economic benefits to the country.
Welcoming refugees offers Europe the chance ""not only to honour its position as a democratic Union that is wealthy and respectful of tradition, but also to expand its growth prospects,"" Patrick Artus, economist at French investment bank Natixis, said in a recent report.
Representatives from OPFRA, the French organisation tasked with processing asylum claims, are currently in the German city of Munich trying to persuade some of the tens of thousands of refugees who have arrived there, to choose France instead.

François Gemene, a specialist in migration with Science Po’s Centre of International Research, said France should be deeply concerned that more refugees do not want to come.
“The fact the refugees don’t want to come to France is a clear sign that the country is no longer attractive,” he told The Local. “They know they will get better opportunities in Germany, Sweden and the UK.”
“The fact it is no longer considered a place to seek sanctuary shows without doubt the economic situation in the country is no longer in good health and neither is the democratic situation.”
He believes France should do more to welcome refugees.
“France has to decide if it wants to project itself it the future in a globalised world or if it wants to be isolated, put up borders and become a museum.”
Holger Schmieding, economist at the German investment bank Berenberg, estimated that the arrival of refugees could boost economic output in the eurozone by 0.2 percent as of the second half of 2015.
Migrants play an important role in economic expansion and in periods of decline, said historian Nancy Green, researcher at the School for Advanced Studies in the Social Sciences in Paris.
New arrivals often work in sectors where conditions are viewed as unsatisfactory for native-born workers, she said, citing the clothing and steel industries of the 19th and 20th centuries and the services industries of today.
""Our continent could and should become a great land for immigration in the 21st century,"" influential French economist Thomas Piketty wrote in a recent column in the French daily Liberation.
(Refugees, newly arrived in France learn French with the help of volunteers. Photo: AFP)
The costs to national budgets are minimal, too, according to a report issued last year by the club of advanced economies, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).
Jean-Christophe Dumont, specialist in immigration at the OECD told The Local that “no study has ever shown that immigration is bad for France.”
Dumont said France was a big enough country and had enough experience to handle the numbers of refugees Paris has agreed to take in.
However the analyst says refugees must be given time to adapt to a country before they can be expected to start contributing financially.
""They have gone through a traumatic situation, they need time to recover. We cannot expect them to start answering job advertisements when they get off the bus,"" the analyst said.
Refugees arriving in Europe would need five or six years to match the employment level of migrants who enter to join families already resident in their host nations, and 15 years to match that of the native-born workforce, he said.
Refugees, like other migrants, do not aim to be dependent on welfare, Dumont added. ""They want to rebuild, to have a better life for their children, to work,"" he said."

					15:03 CEST+02:00				",Ben McPartland,What rights to a future in France for Calais migrants?,"Thousands of migrants are being moved out of the Calais Jungle to all corners of France. But what rights do they have to lodging, work, and social benefits? And how much will it all cost?
Some 8,000 to 9,000 migrants who had spent months, even years in the squalid Calais Jungle camp are being bussed around France to begin the next stage of their European journey.
While many refuse to give up on the hope of a new life in the UK, the majority seem ready to claim asylum in France.
French authorities have promised to deal with applications quickly but it will be a long process before those fleeing Sudan, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Syria and Afghanistan settle down in France.
Here’s a look at the main issues, with the help of Christopher Harrison from France Terre d'Asile, a charity that works with refugees and asylum seekers.
What happens now??
Those leaving Calais on official buses are being taken to ""Reception and Orientation Centres"" (Centre d'acceuil et orientation, CAO) where they can reflect on what they want to do next.
Although there is no maximum time limit on their stay, it is not meant to be permanent. Officially those that decide to seek asylum in the hope of being given refugee status should be moved to a special reception centre for asylum seekers known as a CADA.
The CADA is designed to offer asylum seekers help with their demand whether it be administrative of language assistance. However there is nowhere near the capacity required to cope with all those migrants from Calais.
If an applicant is granted refugee status they are expected to move out within three months and find their own accommodation. Those who are rejected also have to move out and may face deportation from the country.
The status of a refugee in France leads to the automatic granting of a residence permit that is valid for 10 years. This is also given to the refugee's partner and children. However France could also hand out “subsidiary protection”, which would only allow a one-year stay. Many who receive this subsequently appeal and in the hope of being granted full refugee status.

Lodgings
In theory asylum seekers have the right to demand lodging in various emergency centres, but in reality a shortage of options and high demand means many are left without a place. Those unlucky ones are forced to either live with friends or on the streets. Many of those who lived in the Jungle in Calais were seeking asylum in France but had no lodgings.
Right to work
Asylum seekers are not allowed to work in France until they have been given the right to stay. However there is a rule that states those seeking asylum who have been in France for one year can work, but they must apply for special authorisation.
France Terre d’Asile’s Harrison says that while in theory asylum seekers can work after being here a year, the reality is that it's very hard to get the authorisation.
“A lot depends on where you live in, because it is the departmental authorities that will rule over your application. Much will also depend on the competencies of the asylum seeker,” he said.
Those who are successfully granted refugee status can look for a job right away, though in reality language problems may act as a barrier to many.
Right to move around Europe?
Officially asylum seekers are not allowed to move around Europe and should seek asylum in the country of arrival, however this has proved impossible to enforce. In July the EU introduced stricter rules warning asylum seekers their applications would be automatically rejected if they moved around, meaning they would face deportation.
If someone is granted refugee status, then they can travel around the EU as a tourist for a maximum of 90 days. After which they must apply for a visa.
Benefits
Anyone who is granted refugee status can have access to the basic RSA (Revenue solidarité active) benefits and family allowances if a demand is made within two years of arriving in the country. Payment is given retroactively. The amount of money received depends on the family situation on the applicant but the minimum amount paid out to one adult is €524 a month.
For those who have lodged an asylum application they can receive a small daily allowance of around €6.80 a day for individuals or €10.20 for couples. This daily allowance stops if they are granted refugee status.
Health
The migrants are granted health cover, which is paid for under the AME (Aide Medical d’Etat) scheme, which is reserved for those foreigners effectively living illegally in the country. Once they have officially obtained asylum they benefit from universal cover (CMU) which basically means they can visit doctors and hospitals without being forced to pay up front.
Language classes
Despite language being a major barrier to integration and employment, asylum seekers currently have no automatic access to language classes paid for by the state. However several charities and even charitable individuals offer lessons on a voluntary basis. In Place Stalingrad in Paris the charity Baamasso has been hosting open air classes for hundreds of migrants (see photo below).
Right to apply for French Nationality
Anyone who is granted refugee status in France can in theory apply for French nationality, without having to wait a minimum number of years, as is the case for EU nationals for example.
But there are obstacles to gaining nationality that make it hard for refugees to obtain it unless they have been here a number of years. To gain French nationality you have to prove you are integrated and have a certain command of the language as well as a job, criteria that many new arrivals do not fulfill.
School
Children of refugees and asylum seekers have the right and indeed even the obligation to attend schools in France. So we can expect those children photographed arriving from Germany last week to be in French schools within a matter of weeks or months, Harrison says.

A camp on the Italian side of the Italy-France border was cleared on Wednesday as police evicted refugees who had called the area home since June.
Some 30 migrants and 20 Italian activists, who had been warned ahead of the evacuation, moved to the coastal rocks before dawn to be well clear once police arrived at nearly 6:30am, deputy police chief Giuseppe Maggese said.
The camp was cleared because its occupants were using electricity and water without paying for it, a police spokesman told AFP.
A cordon of about thirty policemen stood along the shoreline in front of the migrants, some of whom were threatening to jump into the sea, while others held up a banner in English reading: ""we want freedom to cross the border.""

The camp holds up to 250 people depending on the day, according to local officials, who said a number of people had left on Tuesday afternoon after news of the impending evacuation broke.
Tents and personal belongings from the camp -- which sprawls under an overpass some 100 meters from the French border -- were being removed by garbage trucks and bulldozers.

Ventimiglia, which became a flashpoint at the start of Europe's migrant crisis earlier this year, has acted as a bottleneck for the France-bound refugees who arrived in Italy.
While officially France has called for the Schengen agreements to be “scrupulously” respected by all EU countries, the reality is that Paris has done anything but, at least when it comes to this border.
French authorities have long been implementing controls to try to stem the tide of refugees crossing the border, with the result being that hundreds have been taken back to Italy."

					11:36 CEST+02:00				",Oliver Gee,France urges members of the public to take in refugees,"The French government has called on members of the public to take in refugees because official asylum centres cannot cope with the demand.
France's Housing Minister Emmanuelle Cosse has urged members of the French public to consider taking in a refugee, as asylum shelters cannot cope with the sheer numbers of individuals.
The minister has said that the government would be offering incentives to the charities that could help set up housing situations between refugees and the public.
To house 1,000 extra people, the government is willing to shell out €1,500 per refugee per year to any charity with the capacity to help find housing for 50 refugees or more.
The scheme would only apply to those who already have refugee status, the minister added.
Of course, this means that the public will have to be ready to open their doors to help out, with Cosse calling for ""citizen engagement"".
Those looking to host must be able to provide a private room and must be able to commit for at least five months, she said.
Cosse, pictured below, also announced plans to create an additional 3,000 bed spaces in reception centres ""before the end of September"", more than doubling the current figure of 2,000.
The extra beds will be provided at around 50 centres across France, Cosse told Le Monde newspaper.

France is already facing tough challenges with the influx of refugees, the number of whom is set to swell by 30,000 up until 2017 in accordance with EU quotas.
Charities wishing to take part in Cosse's plan must apply by September 20th in time for an October launch.
The French public has already proved willing hosts when it comes to taking in refugees, with charities like Singa already operating to help refugees find homes among the French.
One Parisian woman, who spoke to The Local on condition of anonymity, said that housing a refugee for five months in her Paris flat was ""a genuinely positive experience"".
""I now have a friend from a background I would never have come across in my day to day life,"" she said, adding the trio would often share meals and discussions.
""It gave me a chance to personalise a faceless issue that confronts us almost daily. I have an intimate understanding of the reasons he left, the risks he took to get to Europe and the determination he has to fit in and stay.""

However, it wasn't always smooth sailing, she added.
""Language was probably the biggest barrier. Even though he had French lessons three days per week, communication was not always easy. Sometimes it required extra concentration which could be difficult after a long day at work,"" she said.
The woman advised people looking to do the same to commit to a time frame and then extend it if need be.
""Don't be tempted to promise too much too soon. It's better to invite them to stay longer than ask them to leave,"" she said.
She also suggested reading up on the refugee's home country in advance and setting some basic house rules for everyone.
""On the whole I wouldn't say the experience changed my life forever but it certainly enriched it. I'd do it again in a heartbeat,"" she told The Local."

“It’s difficult to sleep here,"" one migrant told Le Parisien newspaper after the boulders were brought in.
This isn’t the only piece of so-called ""hostile architecture"" Paris authorities have installed to stop migrants from making camps in the city.

French President Francois Hollande has tried to put the record straight insisting that France is not being invaded by refugees as the far right would have people believe.
Hollande blasted those trying to kid the population into believing they will soon be overrun by refugees.
During a speech in Brussels, where EU leaders had gathered Hollande said: “In terms of numbers, today, France is not subject to an influx of refugees and those who argue that we are being invaded are manipulators and falsifiers, who do this only for political reasons, to scare.”
As the refugee crisis reached a head after the photo of the drowned Syrian boy stirred emotions around the world, France was criticised for not acting to take in more refugees.
In the end authorities agreed to grant asylum in 24,000 who were already in Europe as well as around 6,000 who were already in France.
That prompted many some mayors to openly refuse to accept refugees, while many politicians on the far right and right, talked of the threat to France’s social cohesion.
Le Pen said France is suffering under a “migratory submersion” and even opposition leader and former president Nicolas Sarkozy recently compared the influx of migrants to ""a burst water-pipe"".
But on Thursday Hollande tried to set the record straight.
“Where do all the refugees go today? Essentially to Germany, Austria and Sweden. Since beginning of the year Germany has taken in more than 500,000 people and the country that does the most for refugees based on the size of its population is Sweden,” said Hollande.
It emerged than many refugees actually snubbed France’s invitation to seek asylum, preferring to try to obtain residency elsewhere.
After agreeing to take in 1,000 over one weekend to ease the pressure on Germany, Paris dispatched a team of immigration officials to Munich to convince refugees to seek asylum in France.
However less than 600 arrived on organised buses and no more are expected for the moment, the immigration office said, refusing further comment.
Hollande has being trying hard to tackle the more xenophobic rhetoric that some on the right have been evoking, in particular former minister Nadine Morano who said France was “a country of white race”.
“The Republic knows no races or skin colours,” said Hollande."

The woman was handed a one-year sentence, with nine months of the term suspended, for hiding the 15-year-old boy in the boot of her car in an attempt to get him onto a cross-Channel ferry.
She was apprehended by French authorities at the northwestern port of Dieppe before they could board the vessel to Newhaven on Britain's south coast.
The mother-of-one, who works in a London suburb as a waitress and occasional escort girl, had arrived in northern France to visit ""The Jungle"" migrants' camp in Calais, which she knew well from earlier trips as a volunteer.
According to the French authorities she accepted £500 (€650) from an Iraqi migrant at the Calais camp, who managed to get over to England and asked her to smuggle the 15-year-old across, a task she accepted for ""humanitarian reasons"".
An initial court decision in November deemed her crime worthy of a year in jail.
On appeal at a court in the northeast town of Rouen that sentence was eased to three months in jail.
Including time already served in custody she should be freed on February 12th.
The appeal court also banned her from entering France for five years.
Last week French justice showed more clemency to another British voluntary worker, former soldier Robert Lawrie, who was only fined €1,000 for attempting to take a four-year-old Afghan girl out of the Calais camp in order to drive her to Britain.
Unlike his compatriot he received no money and his act wasn't deemed to be premeditated.
On a visit to Paris on Monday Lawrie urged people to understand the desperation of the migrants fleeing war and misery as they languish in a camp with some 4,000 inhabitants, mainly from Syria, Afghanistan and Iraq but also Sudan and Eritrea.
""You can't help everyone. But everyone can help someone"", said Lawrie, a father-of-four from northern England who has visited The Jungle several times to build shelters for the migrants."

French authorities had asked their Greek counterparts to check a passport and fingerprints of one man and the fingerprints of another who were thought to have registered in Greece, which is the main entry point into Europe for Syrian refugees.
At least one Syrian passport was found at the scene of the Stade de France attack.
Greek minister for citizen protection, Nikos Toskas, said in a statement that one of the men had been registered on the Greek island of Leros in October.
""We confirm that the (Syrian) passport holder came through the Greek island of Leros on October 3 where he was registered under EU rules,"" said a statement issued by Toskas.
French police said the passport was found ""near the body of one of the attackers"" in the investigation into the main attack of Friday's carnage, at the Bataclan concert hall, where 82 people were killed.
The authenticity of the passport was being checked, but its discovery indicates a possible Syrian connection which has been a working hypothesis for investigators after assailants hit six separate locations in Paris.
A Greek police source said the second man had also registered in Greece, with TV station Mega adding this was also on Leros in August.
European security officials had long feared that jihadists could take advantage of the mass migration influx, mainly from war-torn Syria, that Europe has been experiencing since the beginning of the year."

The extra lessons are part of immigration reforms under President Emmanuel Macron intended to balance swifter deportation of rejected asylum seekers with better support for those allowed to stay.
The lessons will rise to 600 hours for new arrivals who are particularly struggling to learn the language, Philippe said after the first meeting of an inter-ministerial committee set up to work on the integration question.
Philippe said French efforts to integrate migrants had until now ""lacked ambition"", adding that the country needed a policy ""worthy of our republic for all those to whom we give the right to stay in France"".
He did not say how much the scheme would cost.

Extra language lessons were proposed as part of dozens of measures in a report by Aurelien Tache, a lawmaker from Macron's Republic on the Move (LREM) party, which he estimated would cost a total 607 million euros ($710 million).
France will also double to 24 hours the ""civic training"" courses given to refugees, designed to explain French values as well as practicalities such as how to obtain work, healthcare and housing.
Many recent arrivals find the barrage of information in the current 12-hour course overwhelming, but Philippe said an understanding of fundamental French values such as liberty, fraternity and equality was ""not an option but an obligation"".
Immigrant parents will also be offered free childcare during their French lessons, while those turning 18 will have access to a new 500-euro ""culture pass"" for young people to spend on museum trips and other cultural activities.
Philippe said the measures, which will also include better help for immigrants in finding jobs, were an investment in France's ""national and social cohesion"".
France received a record 100,000 asylum applications last year and offered refugee status to around 30,000 people, while deporting 14,900.
Though the notorious ""Jungle"" camp in Calais was cleared in 2016, increasing numbers of migrants have been camping along the canals in Paris in recent months, many from Afghanistan, Eritrea and Sudan.

On Monday French President François Hollande once again called for ""registration centres"" to be set up in EU frontier countries like Italy, Hungary and Greece, to better manage the influx of refugees and ""help avoid what is happening today"".
Hollande and German Chancellor Angela Merkel would be ""extremely insistent on the need for control and registration centres to help relieve the pressure.
The pair also discussed the latest developments in the migrant crisis in a phone call late Sunday.
Hollande and Merkel ""share the same evaluation of the current situation of the refugees"" and agreed that both countries would work together to prepare for Monday's EU interior and justice ministers' meeting on the issue, a spokeswoman for the German government said in a statement.
Publicly at least the French government is backing Germany's decision to bring back border controls along the frontier with Austria.
Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve has stressed the blame for Berlin’s unexpected decision lay elsewhere.
The German Chancellor Angela Merkel “is not closing the door to migrants,” Cazeneuve told French radio as questions mount over the future of the EU's borderless rules known as Schengen.
“She is restoring border controls to ensure that those who come to Germany are those who have refugee status and to make sure the countries that border Germany comply with the Schengen rules,” said the French minister.
""These rules, in particular, require the registration of migrants in the country where they crossed the (EU's) external borders,"" said Cazeneuve.
Because some countries have not kept to these rules ""Germany has decided to temporarily establish border controls"", he added.
The meeting is expected to bring to a head the tension that has been developing between France, Germany and Austrai on one side and several eastern European countries on the other other over how to handle the refugee crisis.
France and Germany insist that the EU's obligatory refugee quota plan aimed at relocating 160,000 refugees must be implemented, but eastern European countries like Hungary and the Czech Republic continue to object.
Germany made the decision to reimpose border controls after admitting it could no longer cope with a record influx of refugees. The city of Munich alone recorded an influx of 63,000 asylum seekers in two weeks.
The move effectively suspends participation of Europe's economic powerhouse in the 28-nation bloc's borderless system, one of the cornerstones of the European integration project since it was created in the 1990s.
In setting up the controls Merkel has apparently backtracked on an earlier decision to throw open the country's doors to Syrian refugees.
But the move is seen as a tactic to put pressure on eastern European countries like Hungary, who are so far resistant to the EU's plan to share the burden of a refugees through a mandatory quota system.
Under the Schengen agreement, temporary border controls are allowed for reasons of ""public policy or internal security"".
French press critical of Merkel
While the French government's reaction to Germany closing its borders was fairly timid, sections of the press did not hold back, with many regional newspapers carrying editorial's scolding Berlin.
""Europe is at the mercy of the sudden turns of ""mummy Merkel,"" wrote La Voix du Nord.
Other right wing politicians have been critical of Germany for first opening its doors to migrants and then appearing to slam them shut.
However the country's influential anti-immigration National Front party were left rejoicing Germany's decision
Marine Le Pen's party on Sunday party urged France's leaders to ""suspend urgently the Schengen agreement and re-establish its borders, especially with Germany.""
In a statement signed by Le Pen, the National Front said France needed to close its border ""to prevent the overflow of illegal immigrants who couldn't get to Germany, from coming here"".
But Interior Minister Cazeneuve dismissed her idea as ""stupid"", claiming very few refugees cross the borders from Germany into France."

He said hundreds of riot police and gendarmes were quickly deployed to try prevent the shooter from getting away, although other reports said police waited for reinforcements to arrive before entering the camp.

The Europe-wide ""day of action"" includes dozens of events across several nations with the biggest demonstration expected in London. There are also rival anti-migrant events due to take place, notably in the Czech Republic, Poland and Slovakia.
The biggest mass migration since World War II has divided Europe with Germany pushing for compulsory quotas within the Europe Union but eastern European nations snubbing the proposal.
Pressing his Czech, Hungarian, Polish and Slovakian counterparts at a meeting in Prague, Germany's foreign minister on Friday warned the influx of hundreds of thousands of migrants could be ""the biggest challenge for the EU in its history"".
""If we are united in describing the situation as such, we should be united that such a challenge is not manageable for a single country,"" Frank-Walter Steinmeier said, calling for ""European solidarity"".
The International Organization for Migration said over 430,000 migrants and refugees had crossed the Mediterranean to Europe so far in 2015, with 2,748 dying or going missing en route.
Germany has taken the lion's share, admitting 450,000 refugees so far this year, most of them fleeing violence in the Middle East -- particularly Syria -- and Asia.
But Steinmeier's appeal for EU members to accept proposals to share around 160,000 migrants fell on deaf ears among eastern nations.
Slovak Foreign Minister Miroslav Lajcak said he wanted a solution ""that is not imposed"" but ""made jointly"". ""Migrants don't want to stay in Slovakia,"" he added bluntly.
Denmark's right-wing government also said it would not take part in the quota scheme.
With criticism growing of Hungary's treatment of thousands of people passing through on their way to northern Europe, premier Viktor Orban said he wanted 3.0 billion euros ($3.4 billion) handed to Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan, the first ports of call for Syrians trying to escape conflict.
""If it takes more money, we will increase aid until the refugee flows are drying up,"" Orban told Germany's Bild newspaper.
""These migrants do not come from war zones but from camps (in these border countries), where they were safe.
""They are not fleeing danger -- they have already fled and should not fear for their lives.""
They come to Europe not ""because they seek safety but because they want a better life than in a camp. They want a German life, perhaps a Swedish life"".
Orban's comments come as Hungary builds a fence on the Serbian border to keep migrants out and has adopted tough new laws that will make it a crime to cross the border illegally from next week.
""From September 15, the rules are changing in Hungary, if you cross the border illegally, you will be immediately arrested by the authorities,"" Orban warned Friday.
Orban insisted on Friday that his country was just trying to apply European rules in seeking to register the new arrivals, pinning the blame on fellow EU member Greece for waving migrants through for onward travel north.
EU lawmakers have called for an international conference on migration, together with the United States, United Nations and Arab countries.
Facing criticism that his government has been too slow to help, US President Barack Obama pledged to admit at least 10,000 Syrian refugees over a year starting October 1.
Underscoring the scale of the crisis, some 7,600 migrants entered Macedonia in just 12 hours overnight, according to a UN official, with more buses on their way from Greece.
From Macedonia, the migrant route cuts through Serbia into Hungary and from there veers west into Austria, from where most of the arrivals continue on to Germany and Sweden.
Germany has placed 4,000 troops on standby for this weekend alone to cope with the influx.
From the smugglers who pack migrants into leaky boats, to taxi drivers who charge exorbitant sums to ferry them across land, some people have sought to profit from the migrants' plight.
The French government on Friday suspended an honorary consul in the Turkish resort of Bodrum after she was secretly filmed selling rubber dinghies and life jackets to desperate refugees."

The Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung said the European Commission and Turkish government representatives struck the accord last week and that it would be approved during talks Monday in Brussels between Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and EU leaders.
Under the plan, Turkey would agree to stepped-up efforts to secure its frontier with the EU by taking part in joint patrols with the Greek coastguard in the eastern Aegean coordinated by EU border protection agency Frontex, the report said.
Any migrants picked up would be taken back to Turkey, where six new camps for up to two million people would be built, co-financed by the EU.
EU states meanwhile would agree to take in up to 500,000 people to ensure their safe passage across the sea without the involvement of people smugglers.
The report, citing Commission and German sources, said the plan fleshed out a preliminary 2013 agreement between Brussels and Ankara.
Assuming there is an accord Monday, the plan would go before EU leaders at the next summit in mid-October.
The EU has long called on Turkey to do more to stem the tide of migrants making the dangerous crossing to Greece, with more than 500,000 having made it to Europe's shores this year.
EU leaders agreed at an emergency migrant summit last week to offer more aid to Ankara as well as other countries in the region.
But the EU believes Ankara could do more to tackle what it says are some 30,000 people smugglers in Turkey.
It also wants to set up ""hotspots"" for registering asylum seekers on Turkish soil -- a measure recently ruled out by Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu.
Turkey is currently hosting almost two million Syrian refugees."

Sorrell had met Ahmed in a children's centre in ""The Jungle"" migrant camp in the French port of Calais, where thousands of refugees and economic migrants live while waiting to travel to Britain, often illegally.
As the camp was being demolished last month, she gave the boy a phone with credit and her number on, with instructions to call her if he found himself in danger.

Figures on France's far right wasted no time on Monday night.
Even before details of the terrorist truck attack in Berlin or the suspect who carried it out had been confirmed, far right politicians in France had made their minds up about where the blame lay.
For them German Chancellor Angela Merkel's controversial policy of opening the orders to hundreds of thousands of refugees from the Middle East, Asia and parts of Africa has left the country vulnerable to the type of attack seen in Berlin on Monday night.
French presidential candidate Marine Le Pen released a statement saying: “How many massacres and deaths will be necessary for our governments to stop bringing in a considerable number of migrants into our communities without borders, when we know that Islamist terrorists are among them?
On Tuesday unconfirmed reports in Germany stated the attacker was a Pakistani asylum seeker who had entered Germany in December last year.
Le Pen, who opinion polls in France predict will make the second round run off of next year's presidential election added: “I call for the immediate restoration of our national borders and the equally immediate cessation of relocating migrants among our towns and villages,” referring to the government policy of rehousing thousands of migrants and refugees in asylum centres across France.
The deputy leader of the National Front party Florian Philippot said: “How long can we go on refusing to have our own national borders and how long can we go on with this irresponsible welcoming of migrants.”
The far right mayor of the French town of Beziers Robert Menard said: “Once again, the Islamist terrorist was a refugee. Those who defend mass immigration carry a heavy responsibility.
""The wave of migrants is a wave of death,"" he added.
“Once again it's a terrible consequence of mass immigration. Our emotion will not be enough,” said Menard, who has fought hard against any of France's refugees being rehoused in his town.
Other politicians in France however rubbished the idea that closing borders would end the threat from terrorism.
Former French Finance Minister Pierre Moscovici and current European Commissioner said: “Re-establishing borders will cost three times as much as today and will not work.”
Moscovici said Europe should “stick to its values and insist that we will always be open societies.”
France's recently installed Interior Minister Bruno Le Roux called on French citizens to be prudent but also to avoid any “climate of fear”."

“There will be two migrant camps, one for men only, and one for women and children”, Hidalgo told France Inter.

“It would be abhorrent to say those who arrive will be dealt with quickly and the others we’ll leave outside. I want to reassure them,” said Hidalgo.

He spoke to the migrants telling them that: ""Buses will take you to accommodation around the Paris region where you will be welcomed with dignity. You will be given food and officials will deal with you individually.""
There have been calls for France to house migrants and refugees in some of the 77,000 social housing flats that remain empty.

""I don't know where we're going, but it has to be better than here: we can have a shower, food. Here, there were too many fights,"" said a Moroccan man, carrying two stuffed suitcases.
Paris city authorities said a total of 1,308 people left the dilapidated building, including 40 women.
Authorities ruled last month that the migrants had to leave.
""The idea was to wait until next week, but the situation deteriorated over the past two weeks with serious crimes, a deterioration of health conditions and violence,"" said Paris police chief Michel Cadot.
The evacuation passed without incident, although a group of pro-migrant protesters shouted their solidarity from the street.
The building was first occupied in late July, with numbers growing rapidly from around 100 to more than 1,000, made up of a broad mix of nationalities including Sudanese, Afghans and Eritreans.
The Jean-Quarre school was the last big migrant camp in Paris after the removal of two others around La Chapelle and Austerlitz stations over the summer.
""There were risks of an epidemic,"" said a volunteer doctor.
The migrants will be housed in a dozen centres for a month while they decide whether to lodge asylum claims.
The school is due to be renovated and turned into a homeless shelter in the coming months.
Some 52,000 people have claimed asylum in France so far this year as part of the huge influx of refugees and migrants seeking new lives in western Europe."

The Syrian refugee arrived in France back in 2011 after fleeing the civil war in his home country.
The man, aged in his 30s, bought the lucky ticket for €10 in Bagnolet, Seine-Saint-Denis.
The refugee actually scooped the money last May, but the story of his win has only just emerged this week after the Federation Francaise, the operator of France's national lottery, confirmed it to Le Parisien newspaper.
The refugee, who received his fat check in June, is one of 215 others who won the million-euro jackpot last year.
According to reports he used his winnings to buy an apartment and he wants to bring the rest of his family to France. He also plans to open a restaurant and improve his French.
Before civil war ravaged his own country, the man had owned a successful small business but he’d been making a living as a labourer since coming to France.
It’s not the first time a refugee has struck it big in a Europe lottery. Just last month, a Senegalese migrant saved from a sinking ship by the Spanish coastguard won €400,000 in a Christmas draw."

According to reports the blast was caused by gas canisters that exploded as the fire burned.
It is believed that no one was injured in the incident, but it highlights the ongoing concerns about conditions in the camp, which aid groups describe as” deplorable” and “inhumane”.
One particular worry surrounds the building of fires around the site, which is likely to become more common as winter approaches.
The French government has come in for criticism for not doing enough to help the estimated 6,000 refugees and migrants living in the camp.
On Monday work began on a new tented camp for around 1,500 people, that should be ready to open in January.

The individual was shot dead by French police on Thursday after he tried to storm a police station in northern Paris, brandishing a meat cleaver and wearing a fake suicide vest.
The assault took place exactly one year since the start of a series of jihadist attacks in France, marked by the killing of 12 people at the Charlie Hebdo satirical magazine on January 7 2015.
On Saturday, German investigators assisting the probe into the police-station attack raided an apartment at a shelter for asylum-seekers in Recklinghausen, in the west of the country.
Their statement gave no other details except to say no indications were found that other attacks had been planned.
A source close to the matter told AFP that the suspect had been registered as an asylum-seeker.
- ' IS flag and symbol' -
The news site Spiegel Online reported, meanwhile, that the man had already been classed by German police as a possible suspect after he posed at the refugee centre with an IS flag, but he disappeared in December.
Welt am Sonntag said the man had drawn a symbol of the Islamic State organisation on the shelter's wall.
He had used different names in separate registrations with German authorities, and filed for asylum using the name Walid Salihi, according to the newspaper.
The man had also given different nationalities at each registration, once saying he was Syrian, another time saying he was Moroccan, and on yet another occasion, Georgian.
But French investigators said Friday the suspect appeared to have been identified by his family and was said to be a Tunisian named Tarek Belgacem.
Paris prosecutor Francois Molins had said the man was carrying a mobile phone with a German SIM card, with French media reporting that it contained several messages in Arabic, some of which were sent from Germany.
In Tunisia, a woman who claimed to be the man's mother confirmed that he had been living in Germany but denied he had any links to extremist groups.
She told a Tunisian radio station that her son had rang her to ask her ""to send him his birth certificate. He was in Germany.""
The link to a refugee shelter in Germany, and the apparent ease with which the subject was able to file with the authorities, risks further inflaming a debate over the 1.1 million asylum-seekers that the country took in last year.
Mindful of the political sensitivity surrounding the issue, Recklinghausen's mayor Christoph Tesche said it remains ""our humanitarian and legal duty to provide shelter for those who flee their homes"".
But it was also equally important to work ""intensively with relevant authorities to ensure that people with such intentions cannot hide in our institutions,"" he stressed.
Tensions were already running high after a spate of sexual assaults and thefts during New Year's Eve festivities in the western city of Cologne, with police saying suspects of the crime spree were mostly asylum seekers and migrants.
Cologne police said Saturday that they have recorded 379 cases of violence during the rampage that night, as far-right protests erupted in the western city against the assaults.
The latest link to the attacker in France risks fanning fears that would-be terrorists were slipping into Europe's biggest economy amid a record refugee influx.
Such concerns were already raised when it emerged that two of the suicide bombers in the November 13 attacks in Paris were carrying passports that had been registered as they arrived on a Greek island with a group of migrants in October.
However, French investigators are not convinced that the two men, who blew themselves up near the Stade de France stadium, were the men in the passports."

German Chancellor Angela Merkel told reporters during a visit in the Swiss capital that the message would be shared with European institutions.

A jet that can only seat 19 passengers is being used to thin the refugee population in Calais by transferring them to detention centres around France, according to the StreetPress investigative news site.
But the plane isn't transferring 19 passengers at a time - not even close.
Due to the fact that each refugee must be accompanied by two police officers, the plane is actually only taking five refugees at a time from Calais to other towns in France like Metz, Toulouse, Nîmes, Hendaye, and Perpignan.
And it's not cheap either. The private jet has been rented out to the French state on a four year renewable contract at a price of €1.5 million in total each year, the news site reported.
StreetPress, which spent several weeks investigating what it called a ""ludicrous system"", reported that the Beechcraft 1900 jet flies up to three times a week and has been doing so for six months.
An anonymous police officer told the site that the system was created to try and ""relieve the pressure"" on Calais, which is currently home to an estimated 6,000 refugees.
The officer added that the cost didn't take into account extra expenses like jet fuel and workers' salaries, suggesting the daily bill could be as high as €23,000.
Frédéric Hochart, spokesperson for the UNSA police union in Calais, said the entire programme was coming at ""an enormous cost"" for France.

But most countries have fallen far short of their obligations under the agreement, with France taking only 500 people since the deal was signed.
Across the EU, barely 2,000 people have been relocated under the scheme, while more than a million arrived as refugees in Europe last year.
Most of the refugees being relocated to France this week are Eritrean, Iraqi and Syrian, and would be housed in welcome centres or ""adequate housing"" while their asylum claims are processed, Cazeneuve said.
France has struggled to house asylum seekers, with many setting up makeshift camps around the capital in recent months.

Isaac, a 25-year-old former farmer from the Darfur region of Sudan, lives in a tent under a bridge on the banks of the river Seine in Paris, one of several camps dotted around the French capital.
He hadn’t heard of the warm welcome the new arrivals from Germany were given this week in Champagne-sur-Seine and Cergy near Paris, and said the only help he was getting was from an aid group who come to his camp, where around 350 people live, every second day to bring warm meals.
“Life is difficult here,” he told The Local, toothbrush in hand in the early autumn sun. “I didn’t think when I left Sudan that I would be living in a tent.”

(Clothes hang out to dry at the ""migrant"" camp at Gare Austerlitz. Photo: Rory Mulholland)
Prime Minister Manuel Valls last month said officials would soon turn the “Jungle” there into a properly serviced “humanitarian camp” with tents to house 1,500 migrants. But that is far below the total number of people, many from Eritrea, Sudan, and Syria, currently living there.
“They need proper hard structures, not tents,” said Jean-Francois Corty of the Médecins du Monde charity which has been helping migrants in Calais.
Corty said he welcomed President François Hollande announcement this week that France is ready to do its duty and take in 24,000 refugees as part of EU plans to resolve the migrant crisis engulfing Europe.
“But for years we’ve been asking the government to do more to respond to the needs of those in Calais,” he said, adding that the calls for help by his group and other charities had mostly fallen on deaf ears.
Médecins du Monde set up a health clinic in the “Jungle” in July and joined with several other aid groups to send in an aid convoy of food, hygiene kits and jerrycans.
The charities said in a joint statement that their action was of the type “usually reserved for situations of war or catastrophe.”
Other aid groups in Paris have also grown frustrated with the lack of support given to those arrived long before the photo of the drowned Syrian boy Aylan Kurdi prompted a shift in public and opinion and policy.
""In Cergy, they have a roof over their heads, they have meals, but here [at Austerlitz] what are they doing for them? a woman named Sarah, who was delivering clothes to the camp, told L'Express.

Generations of French travellers have used the famous ‘Guides de Routard’ – think the French version of the Lonely Planet - to choose a restaurant, find a hotel or select that special place for a romantic getaway.
But now the French publishing company has produced a completely different type of guide: one to help refugees and asylum seekers navigate the complexities of their new life in France.
The 85-page guide, titled Hello!, is made up of pictures only, allowing new arrivals to simply point and show people what they need in situations ranging from hospital visits to hotel reception areas.
Other sections cover religion and food, as well as on everything from banking to phone batteries.
The guide is the brainchild of Philippe Gloaguen, founder of Routard who was moved by his disgust for what he believes is a lack of action on the part of the French government in the current refugee crisis.
“Our government is a pack of cowards,"" Gloaguen told French weekly newspaper Le Journal de Dimanche, noting that while France had taken in 100,000 White Russians after that country's civil war, it has committed to taking in just 24,000 Syrian refugees.
“We are not talking about refugees but people who are going to die,” Gloaguen added.
Some 4,000 copies of the new guide will be distributed to FNARS, an organization representing refugee assistance centres across France. Copies will then go to people who need them.
France recently agreed to take in 24,000 Syrian refugees over the next two years, after a request from an EU which is struggling to deal with the current refugee crisis.
Refugees have spoken of their reluctance to come to France due to tales of the notoriously hard to navigate bureaucracy in the country and the lack of help on offer.
At the time, French President François Hollande said it was a ""fundamental principle"" of France to accept asylum seekers but many say there is a lack of political will to ensure refugees feel welcome and indeed want to stay.
But Hollande’s announcement has been greeted with hostility by some sections of the population in a country still reeling in the wake of terror attacks in Jannuary in Paris on the offices of satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo.
""These refugees come from Islamic country at war, a fact which weighs on public opinion in France,"" Jerôme Fourquet, a political analyst and pollster from Ifop told The Local recently.
Some French mayors have also made headlines by saying they would accept Christian refugees only, statements which have been slammed by the French government."

					08:48 CEST+02:00				",AFP,Calais refugee camp on the 'brink of collapse',"UPDATED: With the number of migrants and refugees in the New Jungle camp in Calais reaching 6,000, aid groups say humanitarian efforts are ""on the brink of collapse"", as the cold winter months approach. The mayor wants the army to step in.
Winter is coming to France's port town of Calais, raising fears among aid groups about worsening conditions for the thousands of migrants living in a makeshift camp.
Nighttime temperatures have dropped to around 5C (41F) in the ""New Jungle"" camp, located next to the Calais ring road, and will keep falling in the coming months.
The camp, which is around an hour away on foot from the centre of the northern French port city, has swelled in size over recent months and is no home to around 6,000 people from the horn of Africa, Middle East or Afghanistan.
The sound of hammers echoes through the camp's winding slum-like alleys as migrants try to reinforce crude shelters made of wood and salvaged material against the creeping cold.
""I have nothing to insulate it with,"" says Abdulilah, an Afghan in his fifties who is building a shack. ""I'll wear an extra sweater provided by the organisations"".
The changing weather and uncertainty surrounding a new crisis centre announced by the government this summer has alarmed the area's humanitarian organisations.
""We trudge through the mud,"" said Francois Guennoc, a camp volunteer with the aid group L'Auberge des Migrants. ""There are places where water pools and it gets very difficult.""
""We are buffeted by the wind, the rain, and the cold. It's even worse than the previous 'jungles',"" he added.
The mayor of Calais on Monday raised the prospect of bringing in the army to watch over the New Jungle, even though 750 police officers are already tasked with patrolling the town.
""Maybe the army should come to watch over the place,"" Natacha Bouchart told RMC radio, calling the camp a town ""in which we don't really know what is going on"".
""It would not be inappropriate to ask that the army come to supervise, reassure, and maybe dismantle some networks that may exist.""
Inacceptable conditions
Since September, illegal crossings to England from the port or the Eurotunnel -- they were up to 150 per day in August -- have slowed amid tighter security.
But migrants and refugees keep coming and, predictably, the ""New Jungle"" has swelled.
The number of residents is now estimated to hover between 4,000 and 6,000 people, up from 2,500 in early June.
""We are on the brink of collapse,"" said Jean-Francois Corty, head of the French division of Doctors Without Borders. ""The social welfare system is inadequate and so are the delays to process asylum applications"".
""It is intolerable for a country, the sixth biggest world economic power, to accept that,"" he added.
Another volunteer, from the SALAM charity organisation who preferred to stay anonymous, went so far as to invoke a ""concentration camp"".
About 630,000 migrants have entered Europe illegally since the beginning of the year and Calais is, for some, the last hurdle before reaching England, their dream destination.
Increasing asylum applications have led to more and more makeshift camps popping up around France.
The Calais town hall says there are between 125 and 150 asylum applications per week now, mostly from Sudanese and Eritreans.
More questions
The new crisis centre, announced by the government at the end of August, is slated to offer more permanent housing to 1,500 people. But it has brought more questions than answers.
The site will reportedly be accessible via secure entry where each person will have to present a badge indicating they live in the camp, explained Guillaume Alexandre, director of Vie Active, which is overseeing construction.
But the plan is not finalised, he said, due to fears that the badges could be stolen from the migrants.
There are due to be 125 structures by the end of the year, housing 12 people each in a gated camp.
""We are in complete darkness,"" said Christian Salome, president of L'Auberge des Migrants. ""What are we supposed to do with the other two-thirds?
""There will be excessive overcrowding so tensions are sure to intensify.""
Such a situation will ""create jealousy"" among ""the fortunate selected and the others,"" he added.
All of the organisations agree that a centre that houses 1,500 people is not enough, though Alexandre said his company could double its capacity if it is allowed by the authorities.
The slum-like migrant camp sprung up after the closure of notorious Red Cross camp Sangatte in 2002, which had become overcrowded and prone to violent riots.
That camp also strained cross-Channel relations as London saw it as luring migrants to Calais from where they tried to make their way to England.

					17:02 CET+01:00				",Ben McPartland,France rejects four out of five asylum seekers,"France turned down 83 percent of asylum cases last year - a far higher rate than other European countries, new figures revealed this week. Asylum-seeker rights groups in France have expressed their concern.
In 2013 France looked at 61,455 asylum cases but only granted protection to 10,470 of those seeking sanctuary in the country, according to new figures from the EU’s Eurostat agency released on Monday. Most of those were granted refugee status, with a small number given a lesser ""subsidiary protection"".
That’s an acceptance rate of just 17 percent, which compares unfavourably with the Europe-wide average of 34 percent for first-instance decisions, which asylum seekers have the chance of overturning on appeal.
In Germany, where 76,165 decisions were made on asylum last year, the percentage of those accepted stood at 26.5 percent and in the UK 38 percent of 22,340 asylum cases were granted protection. Italy gave protection in 64 percent of cases and Sweden granted some kind of asylum in 54 percent of the 45,000 cases ruled on.
The low number of positive outcomes in France has concerned certain rights groups.
“Yes it’s a problem. We are worried by why it is so low compared to other European countries,” said Matthieu Tardis , the head of the general secretariat of France Terre D’Asile a leading non-profit organization which provides “legal and social services” to asylum seekers and refugees in France.
Tardis told The Local there were various reasons why France accepts fewer asylum seekers on average than other countries, one of which is regularly put forward by the government.
“The reason always given by the Ministry of Interior is that France does not receive applications from what they deem ‘good’ countries, for example countries ravaged by war like Syria or Afghanistan,” he said.
Figures show that most of those seeking asylum in France come from Kosovo, the Democratic Republic of Congo and then Albania, whereas other countries like Germany count Syrians among the top three applicants. In Britain, Pakistanis made up the largest number of applicants followed by Iranians and then Sri Lankans.
“The government is always telling us we don’t receive the same kind of applications as other countries in Europe. There may be some truth in that.
“For example, in France we only had 1,300 asylum seekers from Syria, which is not many considering what’s going on there. On the other hand we used to get a lot of applications from Albania, but they were often not well put together,"" he said.
OPINION: 'France is failing Syiran in its duty to refugees'
For Tardis and France Terre d’Asile there are other explanations for the low number of cases accepted, that perhaps the government is less willing to accept.
“There is a lack of resources. I think those making the decisions in the first instance have to rule on two cases a day. That's difficult. So the decision-making process is often poor.
“There is also a problem with a lack of accommodation for asylum seekers. We only have space for 22,000 people and we had 65,000 applications last year. This is becoming more and more serious.
“If you have accommodation you have a higher chance of having your application accepted because you have access to legal assistance and you are not having to worry about where you sleep every night and where you are going to get your next meal.”
Eurostat figures revealed that across Europe as a whole there were almost 435,000 asylum applications registered last year.
That represents a dramatic increase on the 335,000 requests made in the previous year.
Of the applications made last year 127,000 were to Germany, (29 percent) 65,000 to France (15 percent), 54,000 to Sweden and 30,000 to the UK (7 percent).
Syrians and Russians accounted for nearly a quarter of all asylum seekers to Europe’s 28 nations."

The attempted smuggling took place after the ex-army training instructor was lending a hand at the notorious Calais refugee camp ""the Jungle"" in late October.
At the request of her father, he decided to try and smuggle the girl, Bahar, back to relatives in the UK.
He was stopped by French border police who found the girl in a sleeping compartment of the truck, and charged Lawrie with ""aiding illegal immigration"".
The girl, meanwhile, was returned to the camp in Calais where she remains with her father.
She was in court on Thursday along with her father to support Lawrie, who escaped a prison sentence but was told he would pay a €1,000 fine if he repeated the offence.
Lawrie, a former British soldier apologised to the French court on Thursday saying: ""It was irrational, I wasn't thinking clearly. I tried to make sure she could join her family.
""What I did was stupid, I was emotionally exhausted. I am sorry,"" he told the court.

.
Lawrie has attracted public sympathy in the UK where an online petition to free him has been gaining steam. The man, who is the first to admit that his actions were wrong, says he has already suffered.
""It's cost me my family and my job. Financially I am virtually bankrupt,"" he said.
He told Le Parisien newspaper that he decided to get involved in Calais after seeing the now famous picture of the dead Syrian three-year-old boy washed up on a Turkish beach.
""That picture changed my life, it made ​​me want to do something. That evening, I took my truck and I came to Calais,"" he said.
Lawrie had visited the sprawling camp several times to build shelters for its thousands of residents living there.
During his visits, Lawrie got to know the girl, nicknamed Bru, and her father asked him several times to take her across the Channel before he agreed.
""Who in their right mind would rather a child live in a tent on a chemical dump than allow me to take that one child to her family five miles (eight kilometres) from where I live?"" Lawrie told AFP in November.
An online petition calling for the case against Lawrie to be dropped has attracted 120,000 signatures in France and 50,000 signatures in Britain."

					11:36 CEST+02:00				",The Local,How an activist for Le Pen's Front National fell in love with a Calais Jungle migrant,"The story of how a Frenchwoman, who used to help campaign for France's anti-immigration Front National party led by Marine Le Pen, fell in love with a migrant from the notorious Calais Jungle refugee camp who had stitched his lips together in protest against French authorities.
She was a card-carrying Front National supporter and her “racist” policeman husband’s job was to help hold back the wave of migrants trying to break into the Channel Tunnel terminal or the ferry port at Calais.
For Béatrice Huret, migrant was just a word, detached from reality, which stood for people from far away coming over here and taking our jobs.
But all that changed the day she first set foot in the so-called Jungle in Calais and saw the squalor that thousands of people were living in as they waited for their chance to sneak into the UK.
Within weeks she was in love with Mokhtar, an Iranian who fled his country where he was persecuted for being a Christian, and whose photo was published in newspapers around the world last year when he sewed his lips together in protest at the appalling living conditions in the Jungle.
And within a year she was facing a people-smuggling conviction for helping Mokhtar and two of his friends make it to England in a boat from which they were plucked by the UK coastguard as it sank just off Kent.
She tells her tale of transformation, romance and adventure in the just published book “Calais Mon Amour.”
Beatrice said that because he was a policeman, her husband was not legally allowed to join a political party, so he got his wife to sign up instead to Marine Le Pen’s Front National, which paid her to distribute pamphlets.
(French riot police hold back refugees and migrants in the now cleared Calais Jungle. AFP)
She said that, unlike her husband, who died from cancer in 2010, she was not really racist.
But she was worried about “all these foreigners, who seemed so different, and who were getting into France.”
Beatrice lived with her adolescent son and her mother around 20 kilometres from the “Jungle” camp, but she had never seen the giant shantytown built of tents and shacks on waste ground on the outskirts of Calais.
On her way home from work one very cold day in 2015, she felt sorry for a teenage Sudanese boy and agreed to drop him off at the camp, which at its peak last year was home to around 10,000 people most of whom who had fled war or poverty in Africa or the Middle East.
(An aerial image of the sprawling Calais Jungle before it was cleared last year. AFP)
Then for the first time she saw for herself what conditions there were like.
“I felt like I was in a war zone, it was like a war camp, a refugee camp, and something went ‘click’ and I said to myself that I just had to help,” she said.
Suddenly, migrants were no longer just a word, no longer an abstraction for her.
Beatrice, who works at a centre that trains young people to become carers, started to bring food and clothing to people in the Jungle, roping in friends and family members to help, and slowly got to know the camp and its people.
Then, in February of last year, she laid eyes on Mokhtar, a 34-year-old former teacher of Persian who had to flee his native Iran where he faced persecution, and ostracism by his own family, for having converted to Christianity.
She met him just at the moment he and several of several of his compatriots had sewed their lips together in protest aimed at getting the French authorities to do something to improve conditions in the Jungle.
(One of the Iranian protesters who had stitched his lips together. AFP)
“I sat down and then he came over and very gently he asked me if I would like a cup of tea, and then he went and made me tea, and it was a bit of a shock, it was love at first sight,” she said.
“It was just his look, it was so soft… I mean, there they were with their lips sewn up and they ask me do I want some tea…”
(An Iranian protester after having his lips stitched together. AFP)
A romance blossomed and Beatrice offered to put Mokhtar and some of his friends up in her house, ignoring advice from her friends that she was making a big mistake.
She was under no illusions about her new lover’s goal. Mokhtar had already tried to get to England by hiding in the back of lorries and now he was about to try a change of tack.
He and two friends gave Beatrice around €1,000 and got her to buy a small boat for them.
On June 11 last year, Beatrice towed the boat with her car to a beach near Dunkirk, and the trio of migrants, none of whom had ever manned a boat before, set sail at around 4am on a perilous journey across the world’s busiest shipping channel.
“We dressed them up so they would look like men out on a fishing trip, with fishing rods,” she said with a smile.
That was the moment when the whole thing might have ended, when Beatrice hoped for the best but worried that she might have been had, and worried that Mokhtar and his friends might even drown.
That very nearly came to pass, when the boat started taking water around 6:30 am when it had got close to the English coast.
The British coastguard sent out a helicopter which eventually spotted them and send a boat out to the rescue.
(Beatrice looks at a photo of Mokhtar on her laptop. Calais Mon Amour)
The three refugees were later questioned by immigration officers, and after a couple of days Mokhtar was sent to an asylum centre from where he could finally contact his beloved who waited anxiously on the other side of the Channel.
“He gave his address in Wakefield (where he had been given accommodation in a shelter). I went to see him the next weekend.”
And ever since then she takes a ferry every second week and drives up to see her lover, who is now in a refugee hostel in Sheffield and who has successfully applied for asylum in Britain. And they keep in touch via webcam nearly every night.
So what of the future? We have no plans, she says, noting that “it hurts when you make plans that don’t work out.”
Last August Beatrice was arrested and charged with people smuggling. She laughs when she speaks of the charge, as for her the idea that she was in it for the money is ridiculous.
The maximum penalty if convicted is 10 years in prison and a fine of €750,000, although she is likely to be given a far less severe sentence if found guilty.
Beatrice has also been put on the government watchlist of people who are deemed a potential threat to the security of the country.
Was it all worth it?
“Yes,” she replied without hesitation. “I did it for him. You do anything for love.”

					08:33 CEST+02:00				",The Local/AFP,Refugees snub France in search of better life,"Talk of high unemployment, a stuttering economy, reams of red tape and language difficulties means many refugees are opting to avoid France in search of a better chance of making a life for themselves elsewhere in Europe.
They dream of a better life in Germany, Sweden or Holland, but one country appears glaringly absent from the lips of refugees on their arduous journey to Europe: France.
So why are refugees skirting Europe's second largest economy, once seen as the promised land for asylum-seekers?
""France is not good for my future, and on top of that it doesn't have the reputation of easily giving a residence permit,"" said Edward, a 24-year-old from Baghdad waiting in Stockholm for a boat to Finland.
Word has spread that going to France means months without a roof over their heads, wading through French bureaucracy and dealing with disobliging civil servants who don't speak English.
The country's stuttering economy, where some 3.5 million are unemployed, is also a turn-off.
France ""is nice to visit but not for work"", said Abdulrahman, a 26-year-old Syrian in Sweden.
Two weeks ago, President Francois Hollande offered to take up to 1,000 refugees to help Germany, which is buckling under thousands of daily arrivals.
Right away, Paris dispatched a team of immigration officials to Munich to convince refugees to seek asylum in France.
However less than 600 arrived on organised buses and no more are expected for the moment, the immigration office said, refusing further comment.
But being granted refugee status in France is only half the battle.
Sudanese Abd Al Kareem, who has spent eight months living in a park in Paris, has been granted asylum but he says the problems don't end there.
“No one here goes hungry. But that's not the problem,"" he told The Local.
""I've got papers, I am going to stay in France.... but what am I going to do? We need work, we need a place to live, we need to learn the language. How are we going to do that?""
'We hesitated'
It is an hour's drive outside Paris, through verdant thick forest and cow-dotted pastures that one group of Iraqi and Syrian refugees were welcomed in a faded-white monastery in the village of Bonnelles.
Their eyes sparkle when talking about France, a ""land of human rights"" with long ties to Syria -- which was under French rule for about 25 years after World War I.
But few were planning to come here until they were approached by the immigration officials in Munich.
""They promised us three things: easy papers, that our families can join us, and a 10-year residency permit,"" said Sabah, 38, an English teacher from a besieged, rebel-held area east of Damascus, eating a French breakfast of baguette and Nutella.
The fast-tracked process will get them residency status in 15 days compared to the average nine months, the immigration office has vowed.
Ahmad, 29 -- who is grateful he left his wife and children behind because he ""would have had to choose which one to save"" when his rubber dinghy sank and he had to swim six hours to the Greek island of Lesbos -- was initially set on going to Germany.
""We hesitated, we hesitated. We had heard France didn't want to take refugees. Other Syrians had lots of difficulties and said my family's papers would take a long time.
""We decided to come here,"" he said, laughing as he explained that if things don't go smoothly in France, he will ""flee back to Germany"".
Family ties are key in deciding where to go.
Saleh al-Moussa, 17, wants to go back to Germany where his brother is registered as an asylum seeker. They fled a few months apart, to avoid forced conscription by the Islamic State group in Deir Ezzor province in Syria.
""I don't have any relatives here,"" he said.
However the refugees are deeply grateful to France for taking them in and most are determined to make their new lives work.
- 'Long, traumatising process'-
Since the war broke out in 2011, only 7,000 Syrians have been granted refugee status in France, out of four million people who have fled the country.
Paris has promised to take another 31,000 refugees over the next two years and is working to speed up the asylum-seeking process and increase available housing.
Sabreen Al-Rassace of the organisation Revivre, which has been helping Syrian refugees since the conflict began, is not surprised that France is not top of the list for refugees.
She cites the ""very, very difficult"" process of getting a house and the ""long and very traumatising administrative process"".
One baffling rule requires that to start the asylum process, you need an address. But you can't get an address until you are in the system.
If you are that lucky.
France has only 30,000 beds available for over 60,000 asylum-seekers, meaning many are forced to live with friends or family, or on the street.
""So Syrians exchange their experiences through Facebook, through Whatsapp and for them France is not a good land to welcome refugees,"" said Al-Rassace.
Then there is the language issue.
Most refugees only have a smattering of English, ""and there is no effort at all from (administrative) employees"", she said, adding that many official forms were only available in French.
She believes the main problem is a ""lack of coordination and the lack of political will"".
François Gemene, a specialist in migration with Science Po’s Centre of International Research, said France should be deeply concerned that more refugees do not want to come.
“The fact the refugees don’t want to come to France is a clear sign that the country is no longer attractive,” he told The Local. “They know they will get better opportunities in Germany, Sweden and the UK.”
“The fact it is no longer considered a place to seek sanctuary shows without doubt the economic situation in the country is no longer in good health and neither is the democratic situation.”
He believes France should do more to welcome refugees.
“France has to decide if it wants to project itself it the future in a globalised world or if it wants to be isolated, put up borders and become a museum.”"

As many as 4,000 migrants, mostly from Africa, Afghanistan and Syria, are camped in Calais near the Channel Tunnel entrance.
They initially tried to smuggle themselves onto trucks crossing on ferries to make their way to Britain, a promised land for them, but changed tactics as security was stepped up.
In July, hundreds tried to storm the Eurotunnel site nightly to enter the undersea tunnel and several paid with their lives, but the figures have fallen amid tighter security.
""How many more will be injured? How many more will die? Are we going to have to get used to these morbid figures? How long will we be haunted during our working hours, our rest, by these surreal images?"" asked the train drivers.
They also said they felt they were working in a warzone with the tunnel site now surrounded by barbed wire, armed police and dogs.
""For the umpteenth time... we call on government, local actors, all decision-makers, to come to our aid as quickly as possible.""
A spokesman for Eurotunnel said he ""understands the emotion described."""

Law, the star of ""Sherlock Holmes"" and ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"", was spotted weaving his way through the mud and makeshift shacks to the Good Chance theatre, which was set up by British volunteers last year.
Around 200 residents of the camp showed up to watch the performance by Law and a group of British actors, comedians and singers, including Tom Odell and Toby Jones.
The event was organised by Letters Live, which gets celebrities to read letters from famous historical figures, and Sunday's event included new writing by refugees living in the squalid camp on the outskirts of Calais.
Law helped organise a petition to Prime Minister David Cameron this week, urging him to press France for a delay to the demolition of the southern part of the camp, which could start as early as Tuesday.
Over 96,000 people, including over 150 public figures, have signed the letter, which calls for children in the Jungle with relatives in Britain to be reunited with their families while their asylum cases are heard.
Actors Benedict Cumberbatch and The Wire star Idris Elba were among the names on the petition.
""These are innocent, vulnerable children caught up in red tape with the frightening prospect of the demolition of the Jungle hanging over them,"" Law said earlier this week.
""David Cameron and the British government must urgently work with the French authorities to alleviate this humanitarian crisis.""
The decision to bulldoze part of the camp is being challenged in court, with a ruling due on Tuesday.
Figures from charity Help Refugees show that there are 440 children living in the southern section of the camp, 291 of whom are unaccompanied.
The demolition by French authorities is part of efforts to discourage migrants from trying to smuggle themselves to Britain via the ferries or the tunnel under the Channel.
""Such an enforced move would uproot again those who have already had to abandon their homes due to war and persecution,"" read the celebrities' letter.
The presence of thousands of migrants in the camp who are desperately trying to reach Britain has become a political hot potato both within France and between Paris and London.
The latest estimates by the local authorities say there are 3,700 people living in the Jungle, and the government has been trying to persuade them to move to welcome centres elsewhere in the country, particularly as the weather worsened in winter.
Announcing the demolition earlier this month, the government's local representative Fabienne Buccio said: ""The time has come to move on, no one must live in the southern part of the camp, everyone must leave this section.""
She estimated that between 800 and 1,000 migrants would be affected."

As countries around the world grapple with an influx of people fleeing crises, a jury led by American filmmakers Joel and Ethan Coen chose the gritty picture about Sri Lankan asylum-seekers by acclaimed French director Jacques Audiard from a field of 19 international contenders.
""To receive a prize from the Coen brothers is something pretty exceptional,"" Audiard said after a victory that surprised many critics at cinema's top showcase.
The harrowing Holocaust drama ""Son of Saul"" by Hungarian newcomer Laszlo Nemes, offering unflinching depictions of the gas chambers of Auschwitz, claimed the runner-up Grand Prize.
""Europe is still haunted by the destruction of the European Jews,"" Nemes said.
""I wanted to approach this history in a different way"" to reach a younger generation, he said.
Surprise best actress win
""The Lobster"", a surreal black comedy about modern love by Greece's Yorgos Lanthimos and starring Colin Farrell and Rachel Weisz, bagged the third-place Jury Prize.
The best director honour went to Taiwan's Hou Hsiao-Hsien for the lush, slow-burn martial arts film ""The Assassin"".
In one of the night's biggest upsets, the nine-member panel handed the best-actress trophy to two winners.
Rooney Mara, paired in the American lesbian love story ""Carol"" with more hotly tipped co-star Cate Blanchett, split the prize with France's Emmanuelle Bercot, in the doomed romance ""Mon Roi"" (My King).
Mara did not attend the ceremony, leaving her director Todd Haynes to pick up her trophy.
Bercot also opened the Cannes fest with a film she directed, ""Standing Tall"".
In a big night for the host country, France's Vincent Lindon won best actor for his moving turn as a job-seeker trying to preserve his dignity in ""The Measure of a Man"".
French Prime Minister Manuel Valls hailed the homegrown winners in a tweet: ""French cinema shines tonight in Cannes and out into the world"".
President Francois Hollande's office praised ""Dheepan"" for ""dealing with virtuosity with the painful subject of Tamils looking to build a future in Europe"".
Mexican director Michel Franco clinched best screenplay for ""Chronic"" starring British actor Tim Roth as a nurse caring for dying patients.
'Strangers in foreign land'
However, critic Peter Bradshaw of London's The Guardian expressed disappointment at the choice of ""Dheepan"", saying it was more of a lifetime achievement award for Audiard, a Cannes favourite.
The ""brilliant director... had actually given us something less than his very best work,"" Bradshaw said of Audiard, whose movies include ""A Prophet"" and ""Rust and Bone"".
Joel Coen indicated that the jury had been divided.
""To some degree or another we all thought it was a very beautiful movie,"" he told reporters.
""We're different people, some people had greater enthusiasms for other things or lesser, but in terms of this movie, everybody had... some high level of excitement and enthusiasm for it.
In ""Dheepan"", novelist and former child soldier Anthonythasan Jesuthasan plays an ex-Tamil Tiger fighter escaping Sri Lanka's brutal civil war.
He and two strangers -- a woman and a nine-year-old girl -- pretend to be a family to get to France on fake passports.
Once they arrive in a rough housing estate on the outskirts of Paris, the makeshift family bonds and Dheepan must use his battlefield experience to keep the three of them safe from drug gangs.
Anthonythasan himself fought for the Tamil Tigers from the age of 16 before making it in 1993 on a fake papers to France, where he was granted political asylum.
Audiard told reporters during the festival that he ""couldn't have placed Sri Lanka on a map"" when he began the project.
On Sunday, he said he started working on the picture long before the current refugee crisis in Europe in which more than 1,700 people are estimated to have drowned in the Mediterranean this year.
""What interested me was the position of someone different in society. These people who sell roses to us when were sitting in a cafe, where they come from,"" he said.
""If it helps the situation, then so much the better.""
Actor Jake Gyllenhaal later said he was one of the film's biggest champions on the jury.
""Over the course of two hours we watch three strangers forced to travel to a foreign land essentially learn to love each other, which is something I've never really seen done in the way it is in that film,"" he said."

					12:35 CET+01:00				",The Local,France scolded for 'round-ups' of refugees ,"A top prison inspector has slammed France for its response to the refugee crisis in Calais, stating that the policy of ""unclogging"" the 'Jungle' camp by flying migrants around the country must stop.
French prison inspector Adeline Hazan had harsh words for France about its treatment of the refugees in the New Jungle, a campsite in Calais that is home to around 4,500 migrants.
The inspector, whose job is to ensure that people deprived of liberty in France have their fundamental rights respected, concluded in an eight-page report on Wednesday that there are ""serious violations of human rights"" at the camp.
She singled out breaches to migrants' rights after finding families were forcefully separated, as well as ""disgraceful conditions"" at refugee detention centres.
At one point, the inspector found 13 people crammed into one room measuring just 11 metres squared. Those detained often don't have adequate access to a toilet, nor a cover to sleep under, the independent body noted.
The report also hit out at the current process of ""unclogging"" the camp, which sees police descend on the Jungle to take migrants off to other parts of France.
It found that between October 21st and November 10th this year, a total of 779 people were taken from the camp. Some 578 were released without authorities even looking into or studying their cases.
The ""unclogging"" is intended to spread the refugees across the country to ease pressure on the Calais bottleneck as more migrants move into the port city in the hopes of crossing the Channel to get to the UK.
Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve denied any wrong-doing in a written reply and said the detentions were a temporary response to ""unprecedented migratory pressure"".
He said the authorities ""intended to deport all the foreigners placed in detention"" and judicial procedures had been followed.
The Calais ""round-ups"" have also been a target by an investigative news site recently, which reported that France spends an annual €1.5 million ($1.7 million) on a private jet to transfer only a handful refugees at a time.
Frédéric Hochart, spokesperson for the UNSA police union in Calais, said at the time ""most of the people who are sent away just come back anyway"".
The situation in Calais has proved an ugly blight on France's reputation as an asylum-seeking destination. Earlier this year, the NGO Human Rights Watch accused the police in Calais of ""harassment and abuse"" towards migrants in a highly critical report.
Last month, France's top administrative court backed an order that forces the French government to improve conditions at the camp after several other NGOs also concluded that the camp had ""serious human rights violations""."

					09:43 CEST+02:00				",AFP,Banksy takes aim at French government with migrant mural blitz in Paris,"The mysterious British street artist Banksy appears to have targeted the French government's crackdown on migrants in a series of new murals in Paris.
The world's best known graffiti painter apparently ""blitzed"" the French capital over the last few days, leaving as many as six works on walls across the city.
None of the works were signed -- as has been Banksy's wont in recent years -- but experts told AFP that they look genuine.
The most political takes issue with France's tough anti-migrant policy, with nearly 40 makeshift camps razed in Paris in the last three years and President Emmanuel Macron determined that the city does not become a magnet for refugees.
In the mural a young black girl sprays a pink wallpaper pattern over a swastika on a wall next to her sleeping bag and teddy bear in an attempt to make her patch of pavement more cosy.
The image is on a wall in northern Paris next to an official refugee shelter which was controversially closed in March despite protests from the city's Socialist mayor Anne Hidalgo.

Since then around 2,000 migrants, including children and teenagers, have been sleeping rough along canals and under motorway bridges.
Migrants were still sleeping next to the mural on Sunday.
Experts said the image echoes the artist's 2009 painting ""Go Flock Yourself"".
Artist defends migrants
Banksy, who has not yet confirmed the works are his on Instagram, has been a long-time supporter of the refugee cause.
However, he has often travelled to make powerful political points with his art about everything from Brexit to the fate of the Palestinians.
In 2015, he painted a mural on the edge of the Calais ""jungle"" camp built by migrants trying to get to Britain, which has since been razed by the authorities.
""The Son of a Migrant from Syria"" depicted Apple co-founder Steve Jobs -- who was of Syrian descent -- carrying a knapsack and an Apple computer.
He sprayed another, his take on Gericault's ""The Raft of the Medusa"", on the wall of a house in the northern French port -- a reference to the shipwrecked hopes of migrants trying to cross the English Channel.
Art historian and street art expert Paul Ardenne told AFP that the Paris murals were very much in Banksy's style.
""The colour, the line, the subject and the way he has adapted the images from photos ... all point to them being Banksy's style during the 2000s. There is a very particular signature. If (the mural of the girl) is not by Banksy, it is a very good copy,"" he said.
Napoleon in a headscarf
Another of the new works touches on the equally sensitive subject of the ban on the niqab in France. It shows Napoleon in a full red Islamic headscarf on the back of his rearing horse as he crosses the Alps to invade Italy in 1800 (see below).

The pastiche of David's canvass, one of the most iconic in French 19th-century art, appeared on a wall in a ethnically-mixed district of northern Paris.
And a third image near the Sorbonne university on the Left Bank -- which was rocked by a student uprising 50 years ago -- appeared to be a dig at the death of French revolutionary spirit.

Ardenne said it does not matter if the murals are by Banksy, but they do ""show that the Banksy effect, and its ability to manipulate the media, works,""
he argued.
""We will look at them far more now thinking they are by Banksy rather than if it had been by any old artist,"" he added.

					10:53 CET+01:00				",The Local,Prestigious French uni offers English courses to migrants,"One of Paris’ most renowned higher-education establishments is offering free language courses to refugees as part of an integration scheme thought up by the university's students.
The course at the Paris Institute of Political Studies - often referred to simply as Sciences Po - began on Monday, with twenty migrants taking part.
The students are aged between 20 and 40 years and are originally from Syria, Afghanistan and Sudan, with most already holding university qualifications from their own countries.
The aim is to help the migrants integrate in French society, but rather than just offering French classes, the university has decided to give the group of migrants the choice between French or English.
A spokeswoman for the university told The Local: ""Most of the students we took on speak English so English language courses were offered because it was important to consolidate their level in this language.
""Secondly if they master English they will have a wider choice of courses to follow at Sciences Po, because many of them are taught only in English.""
As well as joining the language courses, the migrants can also benefit from access to the university’s teaching resources, including the libraries and online materials, as well as extra-curricular activities such as sports clubs, societies and student events.
The scheme is set to last until June but if it is judged successful it could be repeated in 2017.
Language barriers are often cited as an obstacle to integration and employment for migrants and refugees arriving in Europe.
In France, there are no official language classes for new migrants run by the French state, but several charities and volunteer groups have offered French and English lessons in the country's refugee camps like the 'Jungle' near Calais.
However, if migrants are granted refugee status or asylum in France, they can enter into an ""integration"" contract with the state under which they receive free language classes for one year.
Sciences Po is known for its intensive programmes and has been a breeding ground for French leaders, with current president François Hollande and ex-president François Mitterand among its alumni.
Former President Nicolas Sarkozy also unrolled at Sciences Po, but he failed to graduate because his level of English wasn't deemed good enough."

					14:32 CEST+02:00				",Evie Burrows-Taylor,What you need to know about begging in Paris,"The sheer number of people begging in Paris provokes many questions among visitors and locals alike. Why is begging synonymous with the French capital? How do we know if those asking for money are really in need? And is it wrong to hand over loose change?
As everyone who has been to Paris knows, begging in the French capital comes in many forms.
Whether it's someone appealing to commuters on the Metro, or the more discreet appeal of the person holding up a cardboard sign asking for money for food (Pour manger s'il vous plait) on a street corner, it's impossible not to notice just how many people here are searching for a petite pièce.
From the limbless beggars crawling through the carriages on the Metro and the people who approach you as you sit outside of brasseries, to the families in bus shelters and those who play a song or write a poem in exchange for some small change, the sheer variety and amount of begging in Paris can be shocking for those unfamiliar with the city. And sometimes even for those who live here.
Obviously begging is commonplace in most big global cities but why does it seem so synonymous with Paris?
With this in mind, here are some answers to common questions about begging in the French capital.
Is the begging situation getting worse in Paris?
According to people working in homeless charities in the French capital the answer is a resounding yes.
""New populations such as Syrians are arriving and setting up refugee camps, and while this is seen more outside of Paris than in the capital, it affects the city as well,"" said Louis-Xavier Leca, Director of La Cloche, an organisation that promotes relationships between neighbourhood businesses, residents and the homeless living there.
""There have also been more and more French people ending up on the streets in recent years with rising unemployment. And there is a problem with the lack of local solidarity,"" he added.
""After my own experience spending time in Chile and West Africa, I think it can be worse to fall on hard times in Paris than in poorer countries. People tend to be more isolated here,"" Leca said.

Who are the beggars in Paris?
Like in most cities, there isn't one specific ""type"" of person begging in Paris. Beggars can be men, women, young people and old, living on the street, in temporary housing, in a hotel, accommodation for homeless people or social housing.
They may or may not be benefiting from social allowances, may be looking for work or excluded from the jobs market. They might have always had difficulties or been fully ""integrated in society"" before this. They might have been begging consistently or sporadically for many years or just recently started.
In other words, just because someone asks you for money doesn't mean you can guess anything about their situation.
After all it was reported in March by the French press that one in four homeless people in France are employed.

Director of Public Relations and Development at the Salvation Army in France, Samuel Coppens says that generally people begging in Paris tend to fall into four categories: people who are on very low incomes and struggling to make ends meet, addicts, or people from eastern Europe, who are sometimes seen using child slaves, or others who pose as Syrian refugees.
""There's a feeling of sensitivity towards refugees because of the crisis in Syria,"" Coppens said. ""But the people you see in the street claiming to be from Syria are usually either Romany gypsies or economic migrants. That's not to say these people aren't in real difficulty, but they aren't fleeing war zones.""
Has begging always been legal?
Begging was only made legal in France in 1994 under three conditions: that it isn't done in an aggressive way (and that includes not using a dangerous animal), that children aren't used to beg and if it isn't affecting public order.
In theory anyone guilty of breaching these rules can be fined €38.
Despite this, throughout the years, there have been several cases of people being arrested for begging, particularly during the summer months, with local authorities arguing that it is necessary in order that tourists and locals can enjoy themselves without the risk of being hassled.
In 2011 authorities banned begging in certain parts of the city at Christmas to shield shoppers.
How much does it cost to get a room for the night?
There are places called ""foyers socials"" in Paris where people on the streets can get a room for the night but they don't come cheaply.
""These rooms will still set someone back by €40-50 a night,"" Leca from La Cloche said.
Most homeless people in France are also eligible for around €150 in benefits from the French government each month and ""some will opt to spend a third of this on a room for one night so that they can have at least one stress free night"", Leca added.

What do those begging generally spend the money on?
While it's not strictly necessary for homeless people in Paris to beg for money for food or even a room for the night because of the help available, inevitably they do.
Money from begging will also be spent on anything from basic necessities and books to drugs and alcohol.
""Inevitably there are people who choose not to go to charities for their own reasons,"" Coppens from the Salvation Army said. The soup kitchens don't serve wine with their meals and Coppens says that alcohol, along with drug addiction, is behind some of the begging.
However Leca from La Cloche stressed that there are less alcoholics living on the street than there in the rest of society.
""Perhaps the French are more sympathetic to people who want to buy themselves a can of beer or a bottle of wine because we're a nation that likes to drink but realistically drinking on the street isn't about being an alcoholic.
""It's often a way of keeping warm and of lightening the strain that comes with living on the streets,"" he said.
Is there any way of telling the real beggars from the ""fake"" ones?
Naturally there is some suspicion around whether beggars are linked to organised crime.
But Leca from La Cloche says that ""while some people begging are linked to the mafia, this is the minority. In reality, 70-80 percent of people are begging for themselves.""
Unfortunately there's no real way of being sure about this. ""One small clue could be if you notice that people are spending all night somewhere and maybe have a mattress and bedding with them,"" he added.
Although it's important to remember that this isn't a full-proof method, with some genuine homeless people moving on for the night to a room or a safer area.
So what help is available already?
People's choice of whether or not to give to someone begging inevitably comes down to a multitude of factors, not least of all your own principles, it's natural to find yourself wondering whether there might be a more efficient way to help out.
There are a lot of charities in Paris that run daily soup kitchens at lunch and dinner times, where people can go no questions asked, for a hot meal, as well as to find basic necessities.
A volunteer of the French charitable organisation Les Restos du Coeur. Photo: AFP
Just one of the services provided by the Restos du Coeur charity is preparing and distributing proper meals for the homeless at lunch and dinnertime. From 2015-16 the charity distributed 132.5 million meals.
The Salvation Army also provides meals and has teams of volunteers that drive around Paris in the morning to see if there is anyone who might be hungry.
Samusocial is another charity dedicated to the homeless, with their teams approaching homeless people on the street to offer them a room for the night and to see if they need any other assistance.
However while there are places that provide free rooms for the night, as is the case in most cities, there are many who would rather sleep on the streets as a result of the violence commonly found there.
If you'd like to donate money to charities dedicated to helping the homeless in Paris, in addition to charities mentioned above, the following NGOs also work in this field: AURORE, Croix Rouge, Le Foyer de Grenelle, Les Petits Frères des Pauvres, Secours Populaire, La Petite Rockette and Secours Catholique.
Advice on giving
While some are of the opinion that if they've decided to give their money to someone it's no longer their business what it's spent on, others want to be sure that the money is being put towards food or a room for the night.
If you fall into the second camp, it might be better to give to an organised charity.
Advice from charities seems pretty consistent on this issue. While they recommend people give money to charities which can use their resources to benefit people in the long-term, they also endorse the act of giving to people in the street...as long as you're happy to do so.
""I wouldn't judge people who choose to give their money to someone in the street. That's an act of giving, a free act and a wonderful one,"" Coppens told The Local.
Photo: AFP
""I would say that we are in a position to help people get back on their feet, we can step in and use our network to improve their situation,"" he added.
While Leca from La Cloche said: ""Giving to a charity probably means that the money will be better managed but you also have to think of all the administration costs that have to be paid in the running of an organisation.""
""I think the most useful thing people can do if someone is asking them for money is to give the person begging a chance to provide a service, for example say that you're lost so then you have a chance to thank them with a bit of change."""

Didier Leschi, the head of France's immigration office, said the hope was to ""significantly increase the number of aided voluntary departures"" to those who come from outside the EU.
The move comes after the ""Jungle"" migrant camp in Calais was demolished last month, scattering around 7,000 migrants to refugee centres and temporary shelters across the country.
The offer only stands until December 31st, but comes with a series of added benefits. For example, the air fare will also be paid for, and some migrants will be eligible for up to €10,000 of financial aid in setting up employment when they return.
""It can help them start up a small business, depending on the country,"" Leschi said.
Leschi added that he thought Afghani migrants would be most likely to take up the offer, noting that 400 had already voluntarily returned home this year alone.
The allowance has been repeatedly increased in recent months, and had been set at just €350 until October, when it was raised to €650, then raised again to €1,850 in early November.
The immigration office aided 3,051 returns this year so far, and predicted that the figure will reach 4,500 by the end of the year."

With the continent facing its biggest migration crisis since World War II, EU states have bickered for months on how to stem the flow and share out the new arrivals.
There have been steady calls from the right - and more emerged Sunday - for nations to be wary of the wave of people fleeing war and poverty in Africa and the Middle East.
""Not every refugee is an Islamic State terrorist. But to believe that there is not a single fighter among the refugees is naive,"" Markus Soeder, a politician with the conservative Bavarian party CSU told the German press on Sunday.
""Paris changed everything"" and ""this is no time for uncontrolled immigration,"" said Soeder, whose party has been critical of German Chancellor Angela Merkel's accommodating stance on refugees.
Yet on Sunday European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker defended the line that ""there is no need for an overall review of the European policy on refugees.""
The men made their comments days after a team of assailants launched coordinated attacks, claimed by the Islamic State group, in the French capital that killed at least 129 people.
The discovery of a Syrian passport near the body of one attacker has raised fears that some of the assailants might have entered Europe as part of the huge influx of people fleeing Syria's civil war.
Greek and Serbian authorities have confirmed the passport belonged to a man who registered as a refugee in October on the island of Leros and applied for asylum in Serbia a few days later.
'It's a fairy tale'
Poland's incoming European Affairs Minister Konrad Szymanski said Saturday that Warsaw no longer considered an EU plan to redistribute refugees across Europe as a ""political possibility"" in light of the Paris attacks.
Dutch anti-immigration politician Geert Wilders weighed in on Twitter Sunday, writing ""(Prime Minister Mark) Rutte will you listen at last: Close the borders!""
PEGIDA, the German Islamophobic movement, has predicted that attacks in Germany are inescapable ""if we don't stop the avalanche of asylum seekers, if we do not properly secure our borders.""
More than 800,000 migrants have arrived in Europe by sea so far this year, mostly from the Middle East, with Germany alone expecting nearly a million migrants in 2015.
Other voices have called for calmer thinking. Germany's Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere, has warned against any ""swift links"" between the Paris attacks and Europe's migrant crisis.
""Those who organized, who perpetrated the attacks are the very same people who the refugees are fleeing and not the opposite,"" said Juncker. ""Those behind the attacks in Paris cannot be put on equal footing with refugees who are seeking asylum,"" he said.
A source inside Juncker's entourage noted that his words do not mean there is flexibility to even partially review the 28-nation bloc's stance on refugees.
The Netherlands' Foreign Affairs Minister Bert Koenders noted that ""closing the borders creates the illusion that we are safe. It's a fairy tale that does not help anyone.""
""We must not be naive. We have to check migrants so that we know who we are dealing with, but we need to be very careful when linking causes and effects,"" he added.
""I understand this fear, and we cannot completely rule out"" the presence of jihadists among the migrants, but ""we are dealing with terrorism that took place both before and after the wave of migration,"" Koenders said.
In Croatia, which has become the main Balkan country of transit for migrants, Prime Minister Zoran Milanovic reminded that ""closing (borders) and barbed wire does not prevent these kind of tragedies."""

According to a study conducted in 2016, one in two women in France said they will choose trousers over a skirt to avoid becoming the victim of sexual harassment on public transport.
And a 2015 survey of women commuters around Paris revealed that 100 percent of respondents said they had been a victim of sexual harassment.
As the wave of allegations against disgraced Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein and ensuing #MeToo campaign took hold in 2017, the subject of women's issues felt even more pertinent in France where a new law is set to be introduced to impose on-the-spot fines for sexual harassment of women on the streets.
In October 2017 when The Local went on to the street to talk to women about their experiences of sexual harassment, Madeleine La Salle, a 30-year-old Parisian woman said: ""During one packed Metro journey a man pressed up against me and placed his erect penis between my buttocks.
""I was so scared, I was shaking. I didn't know what to do,"" she said.
And La Salle wasn't alone. Every woman we spoke to had a story to tell.
On the positive side, the government has launched numerous campaigns against harassment on transport and there is hope that the awareness brought about in recent months by #Metoo will make a difference.

Paris's own migrant crisis
In recent years Paris has seen sprawling squalid migrant camps spring up all over the city. The latest to be cleared was the one that housed thousands along the Canal St Martin in the 10th arrondissement.
""Teachers in school taught us about France and what a wonderful place it was,"" Khater, who said he was 15 years old, as he stood by the dozens of tents strung along the banks of the Canal Saint-Martin that now serve as home for hundreds of migrants, told The Local.
""I didn't think it would be like this,"" he said, surveying the squalid scene along the canal, whose banks in summer host hundreds of trendy youngsters drinking beer or wine late into the night.
And while in parts of Paris it's the historic Haussmann architecture or the beautiful parks that dominate the view, in other parts, mostly the north and north east of the capital - it's the tented communities that regularly emerge that draws people's eyes.

France's handling of the migrant crisis, or mishandling, as many would see it, has been the subject of much hand wringing on the part of the French government, rights groups and the general public.
Critics ask why France appears to be failing refugees that end up here when Germany has been able to handle more than a million migrants since 2015, with few if any of them having to live in the squalor seen on Paris streets or at the notorious Calais “Jungle” that was finally shut down just over a year ago.
While authorities appear keen not to allow these camps to emerge it feels only a matter of time until the next one. The migrant crisis is here to stay, it seems.
(A migrant camp under Line 2 of the Paris Metro in 2015. It has since been destroyed.)
There are also the camps set up by the Roma community around the city (see photo below), which are regularly pulled down by the police. Another problem that doesn't seem to have a solution.

Homelessness
The scale of the problem of rough sleeping on the streets of Paris is hard to ignore, with the sheer number of people begging in the French capital raising the eyebrows of locals and visitors alike.
Whether it's someone appealing to commuters on the Metro, or the more discreet appeal of the person holding up a cardboard sign asking for money for food (Pour manger s'il vous plait) on a street corner, it's impossible not to notice just how many people here are searching for a petite pièce.
From the limbless beggars crawling through the carriages on the Metro and the people who approach you as you sit outside of brasseries, to the families in bus shelters and those who play a song or write a poem in exchange for some small change, the variety and amount of begging in Paris can be shocking for those unfamiliar with the city. And sometimes even for those who live here.

""There have been more and more French people ending up on the streets in recent years with rising unemployment. And there is a problem with the lack of local solidarity,"" Louis-Xavier Leca, Director of La Cloche, an organisation that promotes relationships between neighbourhood businesses, residents and the homeless living there, told The Local.
""After my own experience spending time in Chile and West Africa, I think it can be worse to fall on hard times in Paris than in poorer countries. People tend to be more isolated here,"" he added.
Drugs
The problem of drugs blights most cities but it often appears more visible in certain parts of Paris.
Obviously if you head over to the wealthy 8th or 16th arrondissements you are unlikely to get the impression that the City of Light is overrun by dealers and crack addicts.
However try parts of the 19th, 18th or 10th arrondissements where authorities and police have struggled to deal with the extent of the problem.
After police moved in to close a so-called ""crack hill"" on the edge of the city earlier in 2018 dealers and their addicts moved into more central parts of the city.

— Le Parisien (@le_Parisien) August 31, 2018
Place de Stalingrad which borders the 10th, 18th and 19th arrondissements and is home to trendy bars became the new hub for dealers selling crack for as little as €6.
The sight of addicts injecting themselves with drugs or smoking them has become in a square once frequented by families. Police and the Paris mayor have vowed to tackle the problem.
Gare du Nord
Gare du Nord is often cited by visitors as being a somewhat underwhelming even dirty and smelly introduction to Paris.
From the smell of urine outside, the dilapidated ceilings, lack of signage and leaky ceilings to the narrow platforms, closed shops, lack of space or the general all round filth, the station has a few well-documented issues.
In fact, it was once dubbed ""the squalor pit of Europe"" by a British exec and even these days you don't have to spend long there to think it might still be deserving of the name.
Part of the problem is the station is located in one of the city's most problematic areas for drugs and alcoholics, with other stations in the north east of Paris showing signs of the strain.
Indeed, the prevalence of dealers and addicts at some Metro stops has led some drivers to skip certain stations because of the drugs related violence, particularly on lines 12 and 4.
Happily -- at least for Gard du Nord and its users -- there are plans to finally give the station a much needed makeover which it is hoped will be finished just in time for the Paris Olympics in 2024.

Homophobic violence
Paris is not a city people associate with homophobia given its thriving gay scene.
If you judged the city by a night out in the Marais quarter you wouldn't get the impression the city's gay community were cowering in fear.
They are not, but that doesn't mean there isn't a longstanding problem with homophobia.
Indeed in Autumn 2018 a string of violent homophobic attacks shocked the city and its leaders and brought the issue to the public attention.
""I'm gay and this is 2018,"" said Guillaume Mélanie, President of Urgence Homophobie, pictured below on the right, who was one of the victims.
Mayor Anne Hidalgo has vowed to take action and former deputy mayor of Paris, Bruno Julliard also regretted ""the proliferation of homophobic attacks, public insults, savage 'outings' and incessant insults on social networks.
""Homophobia is doing very well in 2018. It is no longer bearable, it requires collective action: the police, justice system, schools, associations. Quickly,"" he said.
Antisemitic attacks
There have been 11 anti-Semitic murders in France since 2000 but the killing of an 85-year-old Holocaust survivor in her Paris home in March 2018 which echoed that of another elderly Jewish woman in Paris, left the community in France particularly shocked and scared.
Two people were charged with the brutal murder of Mireille Knoll, an 85-year-old French Jewish woman, who was repeatedly stabbed and whose body was then set alight in a crime being treated as anti-Semitic by French police.
This violent murder which has echoes of a similar case from April 2017 in which Sarah Halimi was also killed in her own home in the same 11th arrondissement of Paris.
It's not just the brutal murders.
There have been incidents in the suburbs of the capital where Jewish stores have been burned down and young Jewish boys beaten up for wearing the Kippa.
And the incident when anti-Semitic graffiti reading ""Jewish scum live here"" was scrawled on the door of a Paris apartment building caused shock and anger in the French capital.

Inequality: Paris vs. the banlieues
When people think of the Paris banlieues (if they do at all), it's likely they either think of them at best as grey, lifeless neighbourhoods full of tower blocks and at worst as places of poverty, violence and crime. There is an element of truth to both.
And it's also true that life in the banlieues is startingly different to life in the French capital, essentially because they've been neglected over the years at the expense of the inner city centre where threre is more wealth, as well as resources and prospects. This is actually referred to as the ""donut effect"".
Successive French governments have been accused of failing to do enough to mend the massive inequality and have been accused of following an ""out of sight, out of mind"" approach to the banlieues.
In truth, most visitors to Paris will have little reason to venture beyond the peripherique ring road which acts as the barrier between Paris and ""not-Paris"".
In 2017, The Local reported that the banlieues were ripe for a repeat of the riots seen there in 2005 when France was forced to declare a state of emergency.
Despite the soul-searching prompted by the outbreak of those riots and may since, there has been very little positive outcome.
And that's in spite of various government initiatives and billions of euros spent over the years.
""There's been a decline that has set in in recent years that is approaching on the irreparable, because ten years on these suburbs are no longer producing rioters, they are producing terrorists,"" said Malek Boutih, an MP for the département of Essonne to the south of Paris and former head of SOS Racism in 2015
On the plus side, the Grand Paris project should at least boost transport links to the outer suburbs and is a sign that psychologically at least Paris is starting to acknowledge it must think of itself as a city whose limits don't suddenly stop at the periphérique.

Gangs
Paris might not be a city known for its gang culture and knife crime like London is, but rivalries between groups of teenagers recently left a 15-year-old dead near Bastille as the problem, fueled by social media, continues to concern police and authorities.
The violence has once again focused attention on an issue -- not one that is not particularly new but one which is increasingly worrying the French authorities -- in part due to the young age of those being drawn into violent groups.
""It's very worrying. There is real trivialization of violence among young people. These are boys as young as 13, more often that not from tough neighbourhoods, who are marginalized and often not in schools. They also lack any kind of parental framework,"" Yvan Assioma, from the Alliance police union, told The Local.
Photo: AFP
Since 2009 a special police unit has been tasked with monitoring and mapping the violence among rival groups of youths. There are believed to be around 40 different groups in Paris, mostly based in the outer arrondissements in the north and east of the city.
Police are however reluctant to call them ""gangs"", because they insist there is very little organisation and structure.
""These are just young people, who might be from the same arrondissement, block of flats or school. There might be a core of five or six, perhaps up to 10, but then they can grow very quickly if needed,"" said Assioma. ""And they can also dissolve pretty quickly too.
""There is no leader or structure like in organised gangs and they often just form for a spontaneous event for any kind of motive.""
Threat of terrorism
The threat of terrorism has plagued France and in particular its capital since 2015, after jihadist attacks left scores dead.
Despite the violence, bars, restaurants and music venues have recovered well since the attacks in November 2015 and Parisians go about their daily lives as normal.
But while the country's state of emergency may have been lifted in November 2017 -- after two years of being in place -- and replaced with a new anti-terror laws the threat remains, with the government saying it thwarts attacks on a regular basis.
It is still the norm to see soldiers and armed police wandering around the tourist hotspots as well as quiet, residential areas of the city.
Attacks on police and soldiers at tourist sites including Notre-Dame, the Champs-Elysees and the Louvre means a high police and military presence is inevitable and given most experts believe the threat will remain for a generation, it is likely to remain that way.
There has also been a marked increase in general security, such as guards at the entrances to bars, shops and concert venues with customers and revellers forced to undergo body searches and bag checks.
While this doesn't really fit in with the fairy tale image of Paris that is so popular worldwide, locals have just got used to it and although tourists numbers have fallen, millions still come through the arrival gates.

""One small good thing to come out of #JekyllandHyde cancellation. Our sets have been shipped to Calais to make refugee shelters,"" writer Charlie Higson wrote on Twitter on Wednesday.
At least 4,500 people live in notoriously squalid conditions in the sprawling makeshift camp which is located in the northern French port city of Calais in the hope that they will one day be able to cross the Channel to Britain.
Since June, at least 18 people have died while trying to make the crossing illegally.
Loosely based on Robert Louis Stevenson's split-personality tale, The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde, the 1930s-set drama was dropped after only 1.1 million people tuned in for the final episode, compared to the 3.4 million that had watched the first.
Higson said the cancellation was not linked to complaints by viewers that the content of the show, which featured a human-dog hybrid, was too violent or disturbing for its 1830 GMT time slot.
Last year, material from British street artist Banksy's dystopian theme park Dismaland was shipped to Calais to be used in the construction of shelters for the refugees."

The UK charity Help Refugees and other NGOs helping migrants in Calais have published a report claiming that their volunteers are systematically harassed and intimidated by the police.
The publication co-authored by UK charity Help Refugees and French NGOs Auberge des Migrants, Utopia56 and Refugee Info Bus lists no less than 646 incidents relating to police intimidation over the past eight months leading up to July.
It is based on evidence given by 33 volunteers.
""This intimidation ranges from systematic identity control to parking tickets, threats, insults and physical violence,"" the report said.
""These volunteers face many obstacles daily including active intimidation on behalf of the police. The French authorities do not only ignore their obligation when it comes to human rights but they also actively prevent volunteers from carrying out their humanitarian work.""

The report was handed over to a legal mediator.
The charities had previously lodged several complaints about police behaviour.
The mayor of Calais Nathalie Bouchart swiftly condemned to report, saying the accusations were completely unfounded.
""If the accusations were true, there is no doubt the authors of the report would have lodged a complaint to the public prosecutor and to the police disciplinary body, the IGPN. These charities - which only exist through there hateful and slanderous discourse towards the police - are only acting in this way for to be heard and for political gain,"" she said.
Volunteers however say they are watched and filmed on a daily basis. They describe police carrying out identity controls and body searches several times a week and say that police rummage through their belongings and search their cars.
One British witness described being body searched by a policeman.
""While I had my hands up in the air, he felt my chest three times. He then check my bottom and the inside of my thighs. He then grabbed my neck and then said 'Merci beaucoup'.""
In the report, UK charities claimed they were sometimes singled out because they were British.
As an example, the report cites that only British organisations are banned from distributing food and basic goods to migrant women and children in Dunkirk, a town near Calais.
Volunteers of the UK charity refugee Women Centre -who visit these women daily - describe being stopped and auditioned by the police as they were going to Dunkirk and said they were refused access to a lawyer.
""It was a very unpleasant experience,"" volunteer Louisa Cunliffe describes.
""We were never told why we had been arrested and we were never told about our rights.
""We were intimidated and threatened. We had the feeling we were targeted because of our nationality and because of our involvement with those exiled in Dunkirk""
Around 1,500 migrants live in Northern France, including between 350 to 400 migrants in Calais, all hoping to make it across the Channel to the UK.
Since 2016, the UK government has paid over £150 million (€166 million) for security and policing in Calais."

					12:38 CET+01:00				",The Local,Calais: Police hurt in clashes with refugees,"Numerous police officers were injured on Sunday night in clashes with 200 refugees and migrants who had blocked UK-bound traffic in the northern French port of Calais.
Sunday night saw violent scenes near The New Jungle, a migrant camp in Calais that is home to an estimated 6,000 refugees.
The trouble began after 200 refugees blocked off the highways that leads into the Channel Tunnel at around 11pm.
When police arrived on the scene, the refugees began throwing rocks at them. In response, police fired 300 tear gas canisters at the migrants. Calm was restored to the area at around 1am.
Initial reports suggested 16 officers were injured but police union leaders told The Local on Monday that in fact 26 officers were hurt by the missiles thrown by migrants, though none seriously.
""This is the first time that it has been so violent and that we've had so many injured colleagues, unfortunately,"" Gilles Debove, from the Calais branch of the SGP Police-Force Ouvrière union told The Local.
He added that officers were concerned about the potential ""madness"" if there was ever any kind of revolt from those inside the camp.
""The problem is you can't predict what will happen here. We work from day to day,"" Debove said.
""In all honesty we just don't know what the solution is to this crisis. There are 6,000 people living in this camp. We will do our job and do it with courage but the officers are very downbeat. They have 26 injured colleagues.""
Clashes between police and refugees have become a regular occurrence although Sunday night's violence was far worse than normal.
Debove added that the vast majority of people in the camp are peaceful, but with security around the Channel Tunnel having been tightened, migrants are getting more and more frustrated in their attempts to reach the UK.
The migrants in Calais are mostly from East Africa and the Middle East, most staying only temporarily in Calais in the hope of ultimately reaching Britain.

Tensions towards refugees in France have proved palpable lately.
""They don't normally act like that and attack lorries. They are normally pretty discreet but it's becoming very tense,"" Debove told The Local.
On Saturday night in Nantes, western France, unknown assailants threw two Molotov cocktails into a building that's home to 40 squatting refugees.
""Whoever did this wanted to kill us, for sure,"" one of the refugees told France TV info.
While none of the squatters were injured, the explosive landed in an area where several people usually sleep. They were not at the scene, however, at the time of the attack.
The migrants, who have lived in the home for a year, chose not to call police for fear they may be deported.

Carefully shielding a lit candle against the cold pouring rain, Syrian refugee Ghaled, 22, had come to the French embassy in Berlin to pay tribute to victims of the Paris attacks.
""We are with them right now, just to help them with this crisis. What's happening to them is happening every day in Syria, 100 times per day for five years, so we know what that means,"" he told Agence France-Presse.
Ghaled was a student in dentistry in Damascus, but decided to leave the Syrian capital after seeing no end to the violence engulfing his homeland.
Like tens of thousands of his fellow countrymen, he first risked his life crossing the Mediterranean in an inflatable boat, before trekking for 17 days to get to Germany five months ago.
But just as he began looking forward to rebuilding his life with German language classes which he hopes would help him return to dentistry school one day, Friday's attacks that killed 129 people in Paris have raised fears of a backlash in Europe.
French police's discovery of a Syrian passport near the body of one attacker in particular has sparked concerns that some of the assailants might have entered Europe as part of the huge influx of people fleeing Syria's civil war.
""It's a problem,"" said Ghaled, who urged against victimising his countrymen, saying the attackers ""are not Syrians"" and that the passport link was simply make-believe.
""I think it's a big lie because all the area is destroyed, and just the passport is still ok? That's silly, really silly,"" he said, suggesting that the passport was either fake or had been planted ""because they hate refugees... so many people hate Syrians"".
""Syrians are not terrorists""
Another Syrian refugee, William, 24, who had also arrived in Germany five months ago, was equally anxious.
""Many news speak about Syrians, police find Syrian passport. Of course I'm worried. It's not good,"" said the 24-year-old tourism student from the northern town of Hama.
""Syrians are not terrorists. we need life and peace for work,"" he said, adding that he wanted to return home once the war is over.
Mouhanad Dawood, who had reached the EU through Italy before eventually seeking asylum in Germany 11 months ago, said his host country has been ""very welcoming"".
""People here understand not everyone are terrorists, a lot of people are running from terrorists, especially from IS,"" said the trained architect.
But he conceded that he was ""a little bit"" afraid that attitudes could change. ""I have my family here now, I want to start my life here.""
To those who have doubts about Syrians after the French attacks, Dawood said: ""A terrorist is a terrorist. It doesn't matter where they come from.""
In Germany, where a debate had already been raging before Paris attacks over the influx of asylum seekers expected to top a million this year, Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere came out quickly to counter any attempt at drawing a link between terrorists and migrants.
""I would like to make this urgent plea to avoid drawing such swift links to the situation surrounding refugees,"" de Maiziere said on Saturday following a crisis cabinet meeting.
He said authorities would watch far-right extremists closely, noting there have already been in recent months ""appalling scales of attacks against asylum seekers and asylum seeker shelters"".
On Sunday, the interior minister confirmed that security would be stepped up at asylum seeker shelters.
'Bombs falling like rain'
The anxiety was also palpable on social media among asylum seekers in Europe.
""Will yesterday night's attacks in Paris affect our lives as refugees?"" asked one user on ""Bus Stop for the Lost Ones"", a Facebook page that is extremely popular among Arabic-speaking migrants taking the Balkan route to Europe. ""Of course,"" replies another member.
""Curse the guy who blew himself up... Did he have to take his passport with him? He should have put it away somewhere and gone to hell,"" wrote Jalal Abazid on Facebook, a Syrian refugee in Germany.
In France, Ayham al-Khalaf, a Syrian journalist who fled from his home city Raqa soon after it fell under IS control, told Agence France-Presse: ""If some French people already mistrusted Arabs, now that hate will increase.""
""The situation will get harder for us here for sure.""
But others who were still on the road and battling to enter the European Union are undeterred, saying any animosity that they might face from the Europeans could not be worse than the bomb shells that are falling daily at home.
Cradling a sick child in her arms as she queued up to be registered at Macedonia's border with Greece, Kalaham, a 32-year old who fled from the Syrian capital with her husband and child said: ""I just wanted to leave Syria. I hope for better.""
""I have no fear. It's chaos in Syria so it couldn't be worse.""
Likewise, Malek Rozhdan, who is travelling with his wife Jusak and three children, said: ""It's very very bad these days in Damascus, where we are coming from. Bombs are just falling like rain.""
""Of course it's not good at all what had happened, but Europe is good for living... This I think is not going to influence our trip in any way."""

It is France's newest and most unwanted town, with its own market, makeshift restaurants, church, library and even theatre.
Now Calais' ""Jungle"" has its own set of postcards.
Migrants living in the notorious camp on the country's north coast have produced a series of ""Wish we weren't here"" cards to sell to tourists.
The poetic and often humorous scenes include refugees cartwheeling on the beach as well as police teargassing the camp, and an abandoned boot on the rail line leading to the Channel Tunnel captioned, ""Cinderella has a brother.""
The refugees behind the idea told AFP they wanted to show how they are trying to make the best of life in the mud of the shanty town as they bide their time hoping to find a way to get to Britain.
""We photograph the beautiful things as well as the suffering,"" said Syrian teacher Baraa Halabieh, 31, who fled his home in Hama earlier this year for the quagmire of the former rubbish dump on the outskirts of the port, now home to 4,500 people.
""I want them to be postcards to (the) future,"" he added. ""I dream of a time when people will drive past here and the Jungle will be gone and people will never believe that such a terrible place existed. All that there will be will be these postcards.""
The postcards will go on sale Thursday, priced one euro ($1.09), a day ahead of International Migrants Day.
Growing hostility
With Calais' mayor - who this month banned migrants from using the town's swimming pool - complaining that bad publicity about the ""Jungle"" had destroyed its tourist trade, the postcards make a point of showcasing the town's breathtaking beaches.
In a nod to the British street artist Banksy, who secretly visited the camp last week, one card subtly features an image he left behind on a wall near the beach showing a child with a suitcase peering longingly at the British coast through a telescope.
Although Banksy graffiti can fetch hundreds of thousands of dollars on the art market, the image has since been covered up by the town's authorities.
Some entrepreneurial refugees have even begun charging spectators five euros each to see the image painted inside the camp, covering it in a blanket until they're given the money.
Photographer Severine Sajous, who set up the Jungleye group of refugees to document life in the camp on Facebook, said she hoped to persuade the town's tourist office to stock the postcards.
""The idea is meant to be a bit funny of course, but it is also to open people's eyes to what life is like here. Lots of people project their darkest fantasies onto the Jungle.""
With hundreds of migrants being rounded up by police in recent weeks as French authorities clamp down on the camp, many are fearful about venturing outside the camp during daylight, she said.
Local hostility to the migrants has been growing, with the anti-immigrant National Front (FN) taking nearly half the votes in Calais in regional elections last weekend, their highest score in France.
With fewer and fewer migrants succeeding in making it to Britain, the camp with its barber shop, bars, Afghan biryani houses, Eritrean Orthodox church and Muslim prayer rooms, has taken on a semi-permanent air.
Nineteen refugees from the camp have died in the attempt to reach Britain since June, with one postcard showing a protest in the camp after a 16-year-old Sudanese boy called Joseph was killed earlier this month trying to get onto a lorry.
To mark International Migrants Day, refugees will also conduct tours of the camp.
Another Banksy graffiti in the camp of former Apple boss Steve Jobs carrying a bin bag of his personal possessions will be part of the tour.
""We're often led to believe migration is a drain on the country's resources but Steve Jobs was the son of a Syrian migrant,"" Banksy said in a rare public statement."

The head of an NGO tells The Local why they can no longer wait.
France’s Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve paid his seventh visit to Calais recently and once again promised measures to help improve conditions for the thousands of migrants camped out in the mud in the “New Jungle”.
The minister’s visit came as aid groups confirmed migrant numbers in the slum-like camp had doubled to 6,000, most of whom hope to make it to the UK.
With winter around the corner, the French government has been criticized for not doing enough for those living in conditions which have been described by various NGOs as worse than a refugee camp you would see in a war zone.
France’s latest attempts at warding off those critics will see capacity at an accommodation centre for women and children doubled to from 200 to 400, with heated tents to be provided for others.
Other refugees will be offered accommodation for a month in different parts of France, while France will make a concerted effort to persuade those migrants in Calais to seek asylum in France, with 2,000 places up for grabs.
But frustrated aid groups, who are working on the ground in the desperate conditions, say the latest measures are just the latest example of ""constant improvisation"" in the government's policy towards Calais.
Jean-François Corty, a doctor who heads the relief efforts for the humanitarian group Doctors of the World (Médecins du Monde) welcomed the latest promises but believe they once again fall short and simply don't reflect the ""reality"" of the crisis.
Corty believes France is still not showing enough willingness to ease the crisis in Calais.
“There are 6,000 people living in deplorable conditions. And everyone knows it. It’s a disaster.
“The minister's policies up until now have failed. France is the sixth largest economic power in the world. We have the capacity to at least provide food and water for these people.
“Some 6,000 migrants are not going to ruin the economic balance in France, even if the country is going through difficulties.
“This is not a question of a lack of capacity or know-how or means. It’s just a question of political will and them not wanting to take charge of the situation correctly.
The half-hearted efforts of the French government were highlighted on a previous visit to Calais by France’s Prime Minister Manuel Valls.
He announced that an official tent camp housing 1,500 people would be built to replace the current shanty-town like huts and flimsy tents.
The plan was met with confusion by those NGOs working in the field, who pointed out that the thousands of refugees who are not housed are unlikely to just return home.
Comparisons have been made with Germany and Sweden, countries which have taken in tens of thousands of refugees in recent weeks, most of whom have been housed in permanent accommodation.
Despite growing pressure from French rights groups and celebrities, France's policy towards Calais still seems to be dictated by a fear that if it improves the situation for migrants, more will simply head to the northern port town.
“They are still scared that [migrants] more will come if they improve conditions for the migrants. But the people are here, so whether they are scared or not, we have to feed and care for them.
“The only thing is to ask what can we can do for those who are here and those that are on their way.
The aid chief compared the response by the French government in Calais to what happened after devastating floods in the French Riviera earlier this month.
Many of the local authorities who were the worst hit were able to declare a state of emergency and gain access to financial aid.
“We have the capacity to declare a state of emergency in Calais that would allow us to take decisions quickly, in regards of the law. But we have not got to this point yet,” Corty said.
“There’s no point in the interior minister coming every three months to realise what’s being done is insufficient and then to take more measures that are also insufficient.”
'Of course he is not solely in charge of that but at the same time he has the means to make sure the refugees on French territory have enough to eat and drink,"" Corty adds.
Which is why Corty's Doctor's of the World and other aid groups are trying to force the government to act, rather than than wait for Bernard Cazeneuve to come back.
On Monday, it emerged that the organization along with other aid groups like Secours Catholiques, have lodged a complaint with court in Lille in an attempt to force France to take the necessary emergency measures in Calais.
They say the fundamental rights of those living in the squalid camp are being violated.
Their complaint mentions the risk of flooding, fires and even explosions given the camp is next to several chemical plants.
It also refers to sexual abuse in the camp, with women and children being coerced into prostitution. Other problems cited included outbreaks of scabies and “severe malnutrition” and the “inhumane and degrading conditions” of the refugees.
Their aim is to see the camp dismantled and all its occupants given permanent accommodation around France.
If France remains reluctant, it may be forced against its will by one if its own courts."

					01:42 CET+01:00				",AFP,"African, EU states focus anti-trafficking efforts at source","Thirteen African and European countries and the EU agreed Friday that efforts to crack down on migrant trafficking to Europe should also focus on economic woes that prompt poor Africans to seek a better life in Europe.
In ministerial-level talks, they agreed to ""attack underlying causes of irregular migration,"" according to a joint statement.
""The economic problem... is also the basis for the migration phenomenon,"" Niger Interior Minister Mohamed Bazoum said.
The countries also vowed to strengthen national laws to prosecute traffickers and improve coordination among police and judiciary in fighting human smuggling.
The one-day ""conference on coordination of the struggle against traffickers of migrants"" took place against a backdrop of renewed concern in Europe over illicit migration, three years after a massive human influx led to a rise in xenophobia and far-right populism in several EU states.
It was attended by ministers from Burkina Faso, Chad, Guinea, Ivory Coast, Libya, Mali, Mauritania, Niger and Senegal, with representatives from France, Germany, Italy and Spain, the European Union and United Nations.
The communique called for ""developing the conditions for an economy to emerge that is an alternative to the underground economy of illicit trafficking of migrants."" To achieve this requires ""an overall approach, with solidarity,"" it said.
Reflecting the issue's priority, France sent two senior ministers -- Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian and Interior Minister Gerard Collomb, who urged participants to take action ""as close as possible to the countries of origin.""
Niger, one of the large nations lying south of the Sahara in West Africa, has become one of the main routes for African migrants heading north to the Mediterranean coast in the hope of crossing to Europe.
Collomb said because of a series of preventive measures taken by Niger, the number of Europe-bound migrants passing through the country had ""dropped drastically"" from 330,000 in 2016 to 70,000 last year.
""If all the countries put such measures in place we can reduce the number of arrivals in Europe,"" he said.
Two Africa-EU summits in 2017 put the focus on training police and paramilitary gendarmerie forces, help with conducting border checks and the creation of identity databases.
Europe's part in taking on irregular migration in Africa gained force with ""migratory pacts"" signed in 2015 in Valetta, capital of Malta, which built on previous accords to reach a global approach dating back to 2006.
One of the challenges, in the eyes of French delegates, is to persuade African countries to agree more readily to provide documents enabling the return of their nationals who lack the required papers.
The French parliament is due in coming months to debate a government bill on immigration, which has already made waves among some supporters of the government who consider the new measure too severe."

					15:30 CET+01:00				",AFP,Macron's 'repressive' migrant law faces rough ride in parliament,"French President Emmanuel Macron faces a difficult week as lawmakers weigh up a controversial bill that toughens France's stance on migrants, with even some of his own party reluctant to back it.
After France processed a record 100,000 asylum applications last year, Macron vowed to grant asylum faster but also to deport economic migrants more swiftly, while better integrating those who stay.
The new law will be presented to his cabinet Wednesday ahead of parliamentary debates that promise to be stormy, with migrant charities and left-wingers blasting the bill as repressive.
Staff at France's asylum court and the Ofpra refugee protection office are even set to strike Wednesday over a law that unions have blasted as ""an unquestionable break with France's tradition of asylum"".
Centrist upstart Macron came to power in May in an election that saw his far-right opponent Marine Le Pen ride concerns over immigration to a record 34 percent of the vote.

While the infamous migrant ""Jungle"" camp in Calais was demolished in 2016, young Africans and South Asians continue to head to the coast hoping to stow away to Britain, while others are camped out on the streets of Paris.
Macron is under pressure to toughen his policy in a country where 63 percent told a BVA survey this month that there are too many immigrants, and has promised a policy that that mixes ""efficiency"" with ""humanity"".
But his proposals are under fire from both sides, with the rightwing opposition Republicans party branding them ""too timid"" and NGOs saying they erode the rights of the vulnerable.
""We're asking for it to be withdrawn,"" said the Cimade charity which works with migrants.
""We're not even in favour of fighting for changes to the bill, because the philosophy behind it is just too repressive.""
Crackdown on economic migrants
The ranks of Macron's own broad centrist coalition, drawn from both the left and right, are also deeply split on one of the most divisive issues of his presidency so far.
The government has already had to abandon a controversial proposal to deport people to a third country deemed ""safe"".
And a separate law on taking in ""Dublin"" migrants -- those whose asylum claims are registered in other EU countries -- sparked a tense debate in parliament last week, with some among Macron's own ranks criticising it.
""We are in danger of normalising locking people up,"" said Florence Granjus, a member of Macron's Republic On The Move (LREM) party.

The law aims to cut the waiting time on asylum applications from 11 months to six, while help will be given to those wanting to go home.
Migrants will in future be put in detention centres for a maximum of 90 days -- double the current limit -- in a measure that has been particularly criticised by charities.
Tighter deadlines for different stages of the court process, making it more difficult to appeal a decision, have also prompted concern among activists and immigration lawyers.
""The bill is completely balanced,"" Interior Minister Gerard Collomb insisted last month. ""It works on two guiding principles: France must welcome refugees, but it cannot welcome all economic migrants.""
Collomb was due to unveil new measures alongside Prime Minister Edouard Philippe in the southeastern city of Lyon on Monday, aimed at better integrating new arrivals.
But the interior minister has come under fire in recent weeks after he ordered immigration agents to go into homeless shelters to check people's residency status.
Charities have taken the government to France's highest administrative court over the policy, which they say breaches people's right to seek shelter without fear of questions being asked."

					17:49 CET+01:00				",Oliver Gee,VIDEO: Journalist mugged at knife point in Calais camp,"Footage has emerged of an apparent attempted knife point mugging of a journalist in the Calais refugee camp. The attackers were then chased away by other refugees.
The video clip shows three men pushing Dutch photographer Teun Voeten on top of a tent in the New Jungle camp in Calais then apparently trying to take his camera.
At one point in the video, an attacker brandishes what appears to be a large knife.
""I've done a lot of work in war zones and crime-ridden areas around the world, so I wasn't surprised about the mugging,"" Voeten told The Local.
""But it wasn't a pleasant moment.""
See the footage below.
As the refugees tussle with Voeten, he yells for help and manages to frighten away the trio, who briefly turn on the camerawoman, Maaike Engels.
""She reacted very well, she filmed it and when he came at her with the knife she just kicked him,"" Voeten said.
The thieves only managed to get away with Voeten's notebook, which they threw away as they fled.
The footage ends with the men escaping, while several other refugees give chase and throw rocks at the thieves.
""They came to our rescue, they scared the thieves away,"" Voeten told The Local, adding that the attack marked the first knife point robbery in the Jungle, as far as he had heard.

The footage has since made the rounds online, attracting over 400,000 views on YouTube after it was published on Saturday. It has also attracted the attention of right-wing commenters, who used it as an argument about the dangers of refugees.
But Voeten and his camerawoman stand by their decision to share it, even if it fuels racial intolerance.
""We don't have any regrets about publishing it,"" Voeten said.
""We put it online because it's a perfect representation of refugees in general, you have good refugees and bad refugees, the bad ones were robbing us while the good ones were rescuing us.""
""We have provided enough context. We have huge problems with self-censorship, and disagree with withholding information from the public for fears they are not mature enough to handle it.""
The journalists were working on an independent documentary at the time called ""Calais: Welcome to the Jungle"". A short version of the film has already been screened, with a longer version to be revealed at film festivals from April.
The New Jungle camp in Calais is home to around 4,000 refugees, most of whom hope to cross the Channel to the UK. In recent days, French authorities have pushed to move around a quarter of the camp's residents out of their ramshackle homes into metal shipping containers kitted out with heaters, electrical sockets and cots for babies.
The move has been met with defiance from some refugees."

The migrants arrived in Spain on Sunday in three vessels, including the rescue ship Aquarius, after being turned away by Italy and Malta last week.
France has said it will work with Spain to deal with asylum applications.

The Aquarius rescued them off Libya's coast on June 9th and Italy and Malta's refusal to let the ship dock led to an international outcry before Spain stepped in to help.

They survive thanks to donations from local people and despite the systematic intervention of the authorities to close down any encampment.
""It's hell,"" says a 25-year-old man from Sudan.
""Last night we couldn't sleep in the woods, it rained all the time. But each time we tried to sleep somewhere in the city, the police came to tell us to leave,"" the migrant who gave his name as Badr tells AFP.
Behind him a group of volunteers from this small city of 9,000 people are handing out food.
Every day Badr says he tries to slip onboard a ferry crossing the Channel to England.
The African migrants, mostly from Sudan, wander the streets of the Ouistreham port amid passengers heading for and coming from the British coast.
Three ferries leave daily for Portsmouth.

Ouistreham is a far cry from Calais where 40 ferries leave each day for Britain and police say nearly 450 migrants are still holed up despite the French government closing the ""jungle"" camp and relocating thousands of migrants who had lived in the immense slum there.
But after the Calais camp was shut down, migrants began showing up in this small coastal town in Normandy.
In the woods
The migrants, all young men, seek refuge in the woods around Ouistreham.
One afternoon last week four of them were warming themselves around a fire amid intermittent freezing rain.
""It's very cold, life is very hard here. The French people are good to us but not the authorities,"" says one of them named Ahmad.
Another man is sleeping nearby covered with a blanket and under a tarpaulin.
But when police and city workers arrive, the migrants scatter.

Claims of harassment
For city's mayor Romain Bail, the migrants ""for the most part do not pose any problem, in terms of aggression"".
But he says he doesn't want his city to become a magnet for migrants. He has taken steps to ensure that camps are not set up and has increased the police numbers.
The CAMO group has accused some police of using measures such as tear gas on the migrants -- though the authorities say they intervene only to enforce the law.
""They (the police) take their duvet, their phone. It's harassment,"" says Michel Martinez, one of the founders of CAMO.
""These men have known worse. They saw bodies floating in the Mediterranean, but still there is no reason"" for harassing them.
""It's the citizens who take steps so the migrants don't freeze to death or die of hunger in the woods.""
While some city residents are hostile to the migrants, he adds, that nevertheless ""every day around 15 to 20 cars come to my home to bring the migrants"" food and clothing.
Near the port terminal, fish merchant Sandrine Simon says she also manages to give the migrants some help.
""They are looking for water to wash themselves, and electricity to charge their cellphone,"" she explains.

					15:31 CEST+02:00				",Ben McPartland,Anti-Islam rhetoric mars French refugee response,"The arrival of the first group of an eventual total of 24,000 refugees in France has been tainted by the ongoing refusal of some mayors to accept Muslims, with one town claiming they “cut off boss’s heads”. Muslim leaders have blasted their ""dangerous"" words.
Further inflammatory statements about refugees by some mayors in France continued to mar the French response to the refugee crisis on Wednesday as well as infuriate the government and Muslim community leaders.
After two centre-right mayors declared this week they only wanted to accept Christian refugees to keep out potential Islamist terrorists, there was even worse to come on Wednesday from the eastern town of Charvieu-Chavagneux.
A memo, unanimously approved by the council, said the town only wanted to accept Christian refugees because they “wouldn’t proceed to cut off the heads of their bosses”.
The town of Charvieu-Chavagneux, is home to around 8,000 inhabitants and stands just 15km from where Islamic extremist Yassin Salhi decapitated his boss in June, before trying to blow up a factory.
The council's text went even further declaring that “Christian refugees will not put others in danger, they would not attack trains armed with Kalashnikovs and would not gun down journalists in an editorial meeting,” referring to the recent foiled attack by an Islamist gunman on a train, and to the massacre at the offices of the magazine Charlie Hebdo in January.
The text also evoked a “war of civilization” and the “arrival en masse of jihadists on French territory”.
While the words of the council at Charvieu-Chavagneux are the most extreme, other mayors around the country have also expressed reluctance to accept refugees – a process which remains voluntary, so far at least.
(Yves Nicolin only wants Christian refugees.)
National Front leader Marine Le Pen vowed that none of the 11 towns run her party would take in any of the 24, 000 refugees the president has agreed to accept over the next two years.
She claimed they simply didn’t have the means, but the suspicion is that anti-Islam sentiment may also lie behind the stance of a party seen by critics as being deeply Islamophobic and racist.
Even ex-President Nicolas Sarkozy has been stoking fears talking of the ""risk of the disintegration of French society"" due to the influx of refugees and migrants. The man tipped to make a bid for 2017 is presumably not talking about Christian refugees.
Members of the French government have strongly denounced the ""dreadful"" Christian-only stance, but Muslim leaders fear the damage may already have been done.
The Union of French Mosques strongly denounced the ""dangerous"" stance of the mayors accusing them of putting the newly arrived refugees at risk.
“These mayors are irresponsible and their words are dangerous especially in the context of this crisis, which is very difficult,” Mohammed Mraizika the secretary general of the Union of French Mosques told The Local on Wednesday.
“Whether refugees are Muslim or from another religion we have a duty to stand together and face up to this human tragedy,” he said.
Mraiziki said the words of the council in Charvieu-Chavagneux, were worse than Islamophobic.
“These people pour oil on the fire. They don’t think about the consequences of their words,” he said.
“Each time there is a statement like this, we notice a steep rise in Islamophobia and racism in France. It’s dangerous,” he said
(French fear that jihadists may be among the genuine refugees coming to France. Photo: AFP)
The head of the Union of French Mosques added that France’s general response to the refugee crisis - which will see 24,000 taken in over two years - is a step ""in the right direction"", but warned that countries like France and UK must “take responsibility” for their foreign policies, which he believes have destabilized the whole of the Middle East region.
The refugee crisis comes at a particularly sensitive time for France, which is still living with the after-effects of the deadly January terror attacks in Paris and the threat of further atrocities.
Security remains high and the public remain on edge after several other foiled attacks including a thwarted gun assault on a church near Paris.
A recent poll revealed a majority of French people had the same fear as the mayor of the central town of Roanne Yves Nicolin, who said this week that he feared terrorists could enter France disguised as genuine refugees.
Since terror attacks in January, cracks have opened up in France’s “national unity” and tensions between the country’s five to six million-strong Muslim community and the far-right have grown.
(Islamophobic attacks on Mosques have increased since January. Photo: AFP)
And since the attack on Charlie Hebdo offices the number of Islamophobic incidents have rocketed, forcing the French government to take action.
Professor Hugues Lagrange, a specialist in Islam, from the CNRS think tank told The Local the suspicion towards Islam by many in France can partly explain why opinion polls continue to show a majority of the public are against taking in refugees from Syria and Iraq.
Lagrange says fear over the future of the country’s economy also weighs just as heavily on public opinion.
However, those involved in the efforts to welcome refugees in France insist the controversial views of the mayors of certain towns represent a tiny minority and should not smear the good work of the government and the French people.
“There are around 36,000 mayors in France. We know certain people will be hostile to foreigners, but the most important thing is that France as a whole is committed to a response that is not based on religion,” Christophe Harrison from the refugee support group France Terre d’Asile told The Local.
“We have never had such a large outpouring of generosity and solidarity as we have seen in recent weeks from the French public,” he added."

Elected representatives of French communist parties PCF and the Left Front proposed on Thursday that the matter be discussed at the Paris Council, a month after the closure of the city’s oversaturated Porte de la Chapelle migrant centre (pictured below).
They’re suggesting the 1,500 evacuated migrants, who are currently being housed in a makeshift camp at Porte de la Villette, be soon rehoused in a much more central and desirable part of the city: Bois de Boulogne park in the 16th arrondissement.
The group has admitted the proposal is a political move aimed at rebalancing the discrepancy in welcome centres between East and West Paris, but they also argue their request is a practical one.

""There’s an unused reception area at the Bois de Boulogne park (pictured in tweet below), it could be transformed into a camp without any hassle,” PCF-Left Front advisor Jean-Noël Aqua told TV news channel BFMTV, adding that there was already running water and electricity.

“We want this park to host a migrant centre as soon as possible. (The west of Paris) must also contribute to the effort of welcoming migrants to the city"".

""We already have prostitutes, we can’t walk in the park after 6 pm,” an unnamed resident told BFMTV.
“If they bring in migrants, where are we going to walk in Paris? As someone who’s lived here for years, I refuse for this to happen.”
Another passerby gave the channel a more pragmatic view, arguing that ""there aren't many free spaces in Paris aside from this park and Bois de Vincennes. We must welcome these people.""
It remains to be seen whether the Paris Council will vote in favour of the proposal next week, but city mayor Anne Hidalgo has already hinted that she wants Bois de Boulogne park to act as an “alternative” to other poorly connected and serviced camps on the outskirts of Paris.

Bois de Boulogne is the French capital’s second biggest park, covering an area more than twice the size of New York’s Central Park.
Commissioned by Napoleon himself, it’s home to stylish botanical and landscape gardens, hosts concerts and marathons on weekends and has the ultra-modern Louis Vuitton Foundation art museum in its grounds.
It has however become a hotspot for prostitution in the city at nightfall.
The neighbourhood in which it lies, the 16th arrondissement, is perhaps the city’s most upmarket, considered to be the French Kensington or Chelsea, a haven for Parisian high society.
It’s also home to PSG’s Parc de Prince football stadium, some of the city’s most emblematic museums and the Roland Garros tennis stadium.

US television network CNN aired footage last week of an apparent live auction where black men are presented to buyers as potential farmhands and sold off for as little as $400 (340 euros).
And the European Union's policy of helping Libyan authorities intercept migrants crossing the Mediterranean and returning them to ""horrific"" detention has been branded ""inhuman"" by UN human rights chief Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein.
Pascal Brice, the director general of OFPRA (French Office for the Protection of Refugees and Stateless Persons) told AFP that France will take in the migrants following a visit to Niger's capital Niamey.
He said the migrants -- who were selected because they need protection -- will be given refugee status ""very quickly"" when they arrive in France.
""It is above all a way of saving people who have come out of a hell, with torture, rape and abduction of children,"" Brice said, adding the refugees were ""almost all victims of sexual violence"".
""The challenge now is that other countries, Europeans, Americans, Canadians, join this process,"" said Brice.
A further 47 refugees who were already living in Niger will also be taken in by France.
Alessandra Morelli, head of UNHCR in Niamey, said ""we have done miracles"" following the evacuation.
Although the figure of 25 refugees is tiny when compared to the 44,000 registered by UNHCR in Libya, Morelli said ""we are convinced that there will be other operations""."

""I'll say it again, Europe cannot accept all the refugees coming from Syria. That's why we need a diplomatic, military and political solution in Syria,"" Valls said Friday evening.
""Every country must play its part; I'm thinking particularly of the Gulf states,"" the prime minister said during a discussion with residents of Evry on the outskirts of Paris, focusing on the response to the attacks which rocked
the capital two weeks ago.
Most of the roughly four million Syrian refugees who have fled their country since civil war broke out have travelled to neighbouring Libya, Jordan or Turkey.
But Saudi Arabia, Qatar, UAE and other Gulf states have remained closed to them, while Europe struggles to adopt a common policy towards the hundreds of thousands of refugees who are arriving at its borders.
Unless the borders of the EU are properly controlled ""we are going to see a humanitarian disaster in the Balkans this winter and Europe is going to close up again,"" Valls warned.
And while the prime minister rejected any link between genuine refugees and terrorism, he also highlighted the danger of terrorists being allowed into the EU alongside those fleeing war -- as seems to have been the case with some of those responsible for the Paris attacks.
""All it takes is for a few terrorists to slip in with the influx of refugees, and the people of Europe are saying, 'Wait, if terrorists are getting in along with refugees, that means any refugee could pose a threat',"" he said.
More than 800,000 migrants have arrived in Europe by sea since the beginning of the year, with the majority coming from the Middle East."

France saw a ten-fold increase in the number of Ukrainians applying for asylum in 2014, according to data released by Eurostat last week and analyzed by The Local.
France received the fourth highest number of applications from Ukrainian asylum seekers last year with 1,415 seeking shelter -- ten times higher than the number of applicants in 2013, which stood at 135.
However Paris handed out one of the highest numbers of rejections to Ukrainian applicants on their first try, tying with the Czech Republic at 220 negative application decisions. France accepted just 35 applicants in their first instances.
Overall, the number of Ukrainian asylum seekers in the 28 EU member states ballooned to 14,040 people in 2014 - more than 13 times higher than the number in 2013 at 1,060 applicants.
That number is even greater when compared to 2008, the beginning of the global economic crisis, when 925 Ukrainians applied for asylum.
“What we have seen from our members working with asylum seekers are those who are fleeing the conflict in the east of Ukraine,” Julia Zelvenska, a senior legal officer at the European Council on Refugees and Exiles, told The Local. “In the past, it has been for political persecution, like in 2013, or for sexual orientation.”
The UN refugee agency UNHCR said last month that an estimated one million Ukrainians were displaced internally, with many people moving west. Some 600,000 people had sought asylum, many of them in non-EU countries such as Russia, Belarus and Moldova.
But many Ukrainians also applied for asylum in the European Union in 2014, a year that started with a revolution in Kiev and the ousting of the pro-Russian president, Viktor Yanukovych.
Russia then annexed Crimea in March, in a move widely condemned around the world, before propping up separatists fighting bloody battles with Ukrainian forces in the east of the country.
Of those who applied for asylum in 2014, 650 Ukrainians received positive outcomes on their first application decision in the EU. Eurostat defines positive outcomes as grants of refugee or subsidiary protection status, or an authorisation to stay for humanitarian reasons.
Still, those who received good news were greatly outnumbered by those who were rejected in their first try - 2,335.
Zelvenska explained to The Local that it is generally very hard for Ukrainians to gain asylum in EU member states, or to even reach those countries in the first place.
“One of the main reasons people get rejected may be that many countries are not clear on how the situation developed and won’t issue decisions until it is clear how the Ukrainian situation is going to develop,” she said.
“European countries are also being very formalistic in the criteria for asylum,” Zelvenska added. “For example, they may say that there are options for alternative protection already within Ukraine. For people in the east, they may say that they could relocate to the west.”
Zelvenska noted though that reasons for rejection are not made public so it is difficult to know for certain.
“We think it’s not necessary to apply all the criteria in a strict manner,” she said. “They must consider each case, country and the circumstances.”
Last year, EU countries received the highest number of asylum seekers since 1992 with a total of 626,000 applicants. More than 400,000 people applied in 2013.
How countries compared:
Germany received the highest number of Ukrainian asylum requests at 2,705, Eurostat reported - 18 times greater than the number in 2013, 150.
Of the Ukrainians who applied, Germany accepted 20 in the first instance, but rejected another 45.
Italy received the third highest number of Ukrainian asylum seekers last year, but also saw one of the greatest increases in applications. In 2013, just 35 Ukrainians applied for asylum in Italy, but that number jumped to 2,080 in 2014 -- a startling 60 times the number from 2013.
Italy accepted the highest number of Ukrainian applicants compared to all other EU countries, with 165 applicants receiving positive outcomes, followed by the Czech Republic (150) and Finland (145).
Italy also rejected 80 Ukrainian applicants on their first try.
Sweden
Sweden was among the top five countries for Ukrainian asylum applicants with 1,320 people, nearly eight times the number of asylum seekers in 2013 at 170 applicants.
Sweden rejected eight times as many Ukrainian applicants in their first instances as they accepted, with just 20 receiving positive outcomes compared to 160 rejections.
Spain
Spain saw one of the most dramatic increases in Ukrainian asylum seekers with just 15 applying in 2013 compared to 895 people in 2014, or 60 times that of 2013. Ukrainians also made up the second largest group of asylum seekers in Spain, following 1,510 Syrian applicants.
Spain rejected 80 Ukrainians in their first asylum application attempts, and had not accepted any applicants in 2014, according to the Eurostat data.
Norway
Five times as many Ukrainians applied for asylum in Norway in 2014 than in 2013, with 130 applicants last year compared to just 25 in 2013.
Norway rejected 75 Ukrainian asylum applicants in their first attempts, but had not accepted any applicants in 2014, according to Eurostat data.
Denmark
Three times as many Ukrainians applied for asylum in Denmark in 2014 than in 2013, with 135 applicants last year compared to just 40 the year before.
Denmark rejected ten Ukrainian asylum applicants in their first attempts, but had not accepted any applicants in 2014, according to Eurostat data.
More than seven times as many Ukrainians applied for asylum in Austria in 2014 than in 2013 with 455 applicants last year compared to 60 in 2013.
No data was available for how many Ukrainian applicants Austria had accepted or denied.

The New Jungle refugee camp in Calais is now home to between 4,000 and 6,000 migrants and refugees, who have made their way up to the northern French port town from the Middle East, Africa and parts of Asia.
French authorities, who earlier this month declared “the time had come to move on” from the Jungle, have given those living in tents or huts until Tuesday 8pm to leave.
Initially they planned to move 1,000 migrants from the southern part of the camp, but it now appears they got their numbers wrong, with aid groups and charities say over 3,000 are facing eviction including 300 unaccompanied children.
The same aid groups who were previously calling for the camp to be dismantled are now calling on authorities not to evict the migrants, simply because there are not enough safe alternatives lined up.
The photos below taken by AFP show how far and wide the camp has spread since police started moving refugees there from other camps around the town last year.
The camp is located on a former landfill site, around three miles from the town centre.
The photo below shows the port of Calais in the distance, where many migrants hope to make the trip to the UK.
Each night many set out on the long walk to the port in the hope of sneaking on board a truck.
This shot shows the makeshift church (the white building with the black roof) that has been built on the site.

The camp, in the town of Grande-Synthe, close to the Channel port of Dunkirk, will be built in January, according to Le Monde. It will provide sanitary conditions for all of the nearly 3,000 refugees and migrants currently living in tents and makeshift shelters on the site, which has been referred to as France’s ‘forgotten’ refugee camp.
Currently, conditions at the camp are considered by many to be worse than those at the ‘New Jungle’ camp in Calais. When The Local's reporter visited in October, he described the camp as ""squalid"".
The project to improve conditions is the brainchild of Damien Carême, mayor of Grande-Synthe, and aid organisation Médecins sans Frontières (MSF). The €1.5 million cost will be borne by the French state.
In a joint statement quoted in Le Monde, Mayor Carême and Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve promised to “rapidly put in place a solution to provide a humanitarian response to the basic needs of the migrants, and particularly to the vulnerable groups on the site.”
According to Delphine Visentin of MSF the camp will meet international humanitarian standards:
“There will be sufficient sanitary facilities and migrants will sleep in tents that will be heated in winter,” she told Le Monde.
The Grande-Synthe camp is mostly home to Kurds who have fled Isis in northern Iraq. When The Local visited the camp, families were living in ragged tents that left them exposed to the elements.
The settlement in Grande-Synthe has existed since 2006 but for years had fewer than 100 migrants. Since September its population has exploded.

					14:55 CEST+02:00				",AFP,Europe: promised land for educated refugees,"Far from backgrounds of extreme poverty, many of the hundreds of thousands of migrants and refugees inching their way through the continent studied at university or worked in good jobs before disaster hit.
And according to immigration authorities, refugees and those who work with them, this is particularly true for Syrians, whose country used to have one of the best education systems in the region before it plunged into war and chaos in 2011.
""Syrians... are looking for somewhere where they can have the quality of life that they had before the conflict,"" says Arezo Malakooti, head of migration research at Altai Consulting, which has done work for the International Organization for Migration and the UN.
""Syria was very much like a European country before the war, with relatively good standards of living, a relatively educated population.
""You had poor people in the country as well but in general, it stood out in the region.""
Take Mohammed al-Taweel, a computer engineer from downtown Damascus who landed on the Greek island of Lesbos this week.
""There was nothing I could do in my country for myself or for my future,"" he said on the beach, drying off in the sun before setting off on the gruelling 60-kilometre (37-mile) walk to the main town.
The 24-year-old said he wanted to continue working as an engineer, but acknowledged he may need more diplomas wherever he ended up.
Data collected in Germany between January 2013 and September 2014 show that 78 percent of Syrians who arrived in the country came from middle or upper class sections of society and had a good education, according to the country's Federal Office for Migration and Refugees.
German Labour Minister Andrea Nahles sought to lower expectations this week by telling lawmakers that the ""Syrian doctor is an exception"", as a large part of refugees walking through Europe also come with very little education or resources.
But a translator in a centre for asylum seekers in Berlin confirmed that the Syrians who came through were by-and-large well educated.
Many Afghans also make the trip through Greece into Europe, and while their country suffers from poverty and low literacy rates, those who leave are not always the worst off, says Malakooti.
In Lesbos, Fayiq Abubakar, an 18-year-old from Mazar-e-Sharif in Afghanistan, is headed to Germany where his uncle lives.
He wants to study international trade and finance after going to one of the ""top three schools"" in his area.
Through her research, Malakooti says she has found that the realisation there is a better life elsewhere is much more influential in pushing people to migrate than ""absolute need.""
""Often as income levels rise, the desire to migrate also increases because you become more aware of what is going on in the world.""
But after surviving dangerous sea crossings, hostile populations and security forces, Fayiq, Mohammed and others may end up sorely disappointed when they finally reach their country-of-choice.
""The struggle isn't over just because you get the refugee status,"" says Fatiha Mlati, head of integration at France Terre d'Asile, an association that works with asylum seekers and refugees.
""It's very difficult to have access to health services, to social rights, to have your diploma recognised.
""Those who are super qualified think that it will be simple, and for the most part they will have to take jobs that don't match their qualifications,"" she says.
""And it can be a very long process for those who hardly have any qualifications, on top of the fact that they may have language problems.""
That means that in France, many of those who arrive as engineers or accountants end up washing dishes in restaurants, delivering pizzas or job-hunting.
Bilal is from Aleppo in Syria, where he worked as an accountant.
Just like many Syrians trekking through Europe today, he fled the regime in 2013 and made it to France where he now lives outside Paris.
""I got refugee status a year ago,"" he says.
""But I still don't have a job, due to language difficulties.""
As for Mohammed, a Syrian who studied electrical engineering in Aleppo, he is working as a cook in a restaurant.
But far from complaining, he is enthusiastic.
""Europe for us was a dream that was completely inaccessible under the dictatorship of Bashar (al-Assad). This dream is becoming reality,"" he says.
""I even have cousins who for years have been living in Gulf countries. Today, they are considering leaving to come to Europe."""

					08:24 CET+01:00				",AFP,French sailors face jail for taking refugees to UK,"French prosecutors on Wednesday requested prison terms of up to eight years for a group of sailors and suspected people smugglers accused of ferrying scores of illegal migrants across the sea to Britain.
Eighteen people are on trial in the western city of Rennes accused of pocketing hefty sums to smuggle at least 127 Albanian migrants into England.
In her closing arguments Wednesday, public prosecutor Anne Fourmel accused the defendants of ""exploiting human misery"" by demanding up to €20,000 ($22,000) per family to help migrants ""reach El Dorado in Britain"". For a single migrant, the fee was around €6,000, she said.
The migrants were taken across the water in speedboats and yachts, with around 16 such crossings from ports in the north and west of France recorded in 2012, an investigation found.
The prosecutor requested the stiffest sentence for Edmond Rapi, an Albanian accused of playing a ""major role"" in setting up the Brittany-based network.
She requested a similar sentence of seven years jail and a fine of €150,000 for a Kosovan who goes by Bujar Curri as well as a man presented as the French lynchpin in the operation, Philippe Collin.
Collin denies having profited from the smuggling.
A group of skippers, mostly young Bretons, also face prison terms for transporting the migrants.
Two people implicated in the affair have committed suicide since the investigation began -- a sailor and a woman said to have been involved in organising the crossings.
In a separate case, a young French fisherman was arrested last month on suspicion of also helping migrants cross the Channel.
The suspect was caught red-handed, on shore, while preparing an inflatable Zodiac boat for the voyage, police said.
Seven other people, including Vietnamese and Albanian nationals were arrested for their suspected role in the operation."

France's Muslim population has greatly increased in recent years.
This is partly down to a record number of people seeking asylum in Europe as they flee conflicts in Syria and other predominantly Muslim countries, but mainly due to normal migration from Muslim countries.
Between mid-2010 and mid-2016, France received more than half a million Muslim migrants. Most of these were regular migrants rather than asylum seekers, according to the report by respected American think-tank Pew Research Centre which calls itself ""non-partisan"".
During this time, France also accepted a total of 80,000 refugees, most of whom were Muslim.
Pew's new study looking at how this is likely to change Europe's population predicts what it could mean for the future make up of France according to three possible scenarios.
Graph: Pew
The first considers how France's Muslim population would be impacted by 2050 if migration stops altogether.
If arrivals halted altogether, France -- which was home to an estimated 5.7 million Muslims (8.8 percent of the population) in 2016 according to the report -- would continue to have Europe's largest Muslim community.
READ ALSO: French 'worst in world' at estimating country's Muslim population
Table: Pew
Pew predicts the figure would rise to 8.6 million or 12.7 percent of the population.
""Those countries with Muslim populations that are especially young, or have a relatively large number of children, like France, as well as Italy and Belgium, would see the most significant change in the zero migration scenario,"" reveals the report.
Map: Pew
""Medium"" and ""high"" migration scenarios
The second scenario looks at a ""medium migration scenario"", that is to say if regular migration continues in the future but there are no more asylum seekers.
If this is the case, France would be surpassed by the United Kingdom as the country in Europe with the highest population of people who identify themselves as Muslims.
Map: Pew
This would see France with a Muslim population of 12.6 million in 2050 or 17.4 percent of the population, compared to 8.5 million in Germany and 13 million Muslims in the UK (17.4 percent), says the report.
""This is because the UK was the top destination country for regular Muslim migrants as opposed to refugees,"" the report said.
""Both France and the UK are expected to be roughly 17 percent Muslim by 2050 in the medium scenario, several percentage points higher than they would be if all future migration were to stop.""
Meanwhile in the third category, which ""assumes that the current refugee flows will continue in the coming decades, not only at the same volume but also with the same religious composition"", France would have a Muslim population of 13.2 million, making up 18 percent of the population by 2050.
In this ""high scenario"", Germany would be home to 17.5 million Muslims by 2050, by far the highest number of Muslims in Europe.
Overall, Muslims could make up over 11 percent of Europe's population in the coming decades, compared with just under 5 percent currently, if legal migration levels are maintained, the US-based think tank said.
Map: Pew
In December 2016, The Local reported that the French are one of the worst nations in the world for overestimating the Muslim population in their country, according to a study by market research company Ipsos Mori.
French people reckoned that 31 percent of the population was Muslim, when the real figure according to Pew research in 2010 was 7.5 percent."

He's just one of an increasing number of French people tempted into people smuggling in exchange for large sums of money.
A young French fisherman accused of helping migrants cross the Channel to Britain was arrested with five others near the port town of Dunkirk, a judicial source said on Wednesday.
The man, who is thought to be around 20, was detained on Monday along with two Vietnamese citizens and three Albanians, a judicial source in the northern city of Lille said.
The six people are currently being held in detention and could be charged by Friday, the source said.
The fisherman had been smuggling migrants to Britain ""for several months"" on an inflatable boat that could carry more than a dozen people.
Migrants were charged between €10,000 and €12,000 ($11,000 to $13,000), the source added.
The boat would leave from a quiet beach near Dunkirk at night, and landed on the British shore after a perilous 90-kilometre journey.
A ""large sum of money"" was seized at the time of the arrest, the source said.
Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve confirmed the arrest on Europe 1 radio but said it was too early to discuss the details.
""We have dismantled a very large number of networks since the start of the year,"" he said.
""In France, it's nearly 200 networks representing 3,000 individuals, and in the Calais region it's around 30 networks, representing 700 individuals,"" he said, adding that they should be ""severely punished"".
Although the figures pale in comparison to the numbers arriving in Germany and elsewhere, thousands of migrants have come through France this year, mostly from the Middle East and east Africa in the hope of reaching Britain.
Earlier this year The Local reported how traffickers were targeting hard-up French people in northern France in the hope of persuading them to take migrants across the Channel in their own vehicles, in exchange for cash.
French authorities revealed that unemployed people in parts of northern France are being tempted into illegally ferrying migrants across the channel in their cars for as much as €2,000 per person.
French lawyer Emmanuelle Osmont, based in the port town of Boulogne sur Mer, told The Local that the traffickers preyed on locals in need of money.
“In the past the traffickers, who are often from Asia or Albania, recruited people around them to do these journeys, but the risks became too great. Then they turned to the truck drivers, but now it's local French people who are suffering from financial difficulties,” Osmont said.
She said the traffickers, who are earning “millions each year”, are specifically targeting those French people living in poorer areas and trying to persuade them they are doing a good deed.
“We have even had two or three students up before the courts and they are targeting local business people who may be struggling to pay their bills or their taxes, because of the ongoing economic crisis” she said. “The mafia is benefiting from that.”"

Occitane: 71 centres, more than 1,000 beds.
Provence-Alpes-Cote-D'Azur: 29 centres, fewer than 1,000 beds.
The Interior Ministry noted that 60 percent of these centres had space for fewer than 20 migrants, and only three of them can house more than 50 people.
Three in every five of the centres were located in towns with populations larger than 30,000, and the average migrant costs €25 per day when living in such a centre, the ministry added.
An interactive map published in Le Parisien newspaper showed a more detailed map of the the spread of the centres.
The map reveals exactly how many migrants will be sent to each commune, although the exact addresses of the centres aren't given.
The map is based on unofficial information from Cimande, gathered by other aid groups and local newspapers. The information hasn't been confirmed by the Interior Ministry.

					11:29 CEST+02:00				",AFP,"After escaping war, refugees enjoy Paris","Taking selfies and bursting into song, 200 Syrian, Iraqi and Kurdish refugees on Saturday visited some of Paris's most popular sights thanks to a non-profit organisation named Secours Populaire.
This summer, they were fleeing war. But this weekend the refugees took smiling photos as they experienced the city of lights and dreamt of a new future in France with the help of the organisation that has in the past worked with Spanish Republican exiles and people fleeing Nazi Germany.
Nour Shekhany, a 22-year-old who was studying economics in Damascus before fleeing Syria, said he wanted to see ""the bridge that collapsed from all of the love padlocks"" -- or the famous Pont des Arts.
Currently living in Cergy, northwest of Paris, they are some of the migrants welcomed by France to help neighbouring Germany with its influx of asylum seekers.
""I never imagined being here,"" said Ali Merkath, 33, who came with his wife and two children.

""Baghdad, that's done. Now, my country is France, this is where we will build our future.""
But for some refugees, the moment is bittersweet.
Aboud Omar from Syria's devastated Aleppo left his wife and six children -- one of whom is just a newborn -- at a refugee camp in Turkey.
""I ask God and the French government to bring my family here as soon as possible,"" said Omar, 37."

					11:30 CET+01:00				",Ben McPartland,OPINION: Britain throwing even more money at security in Calais is not the answer,"Spending €50 million on more fences, walls, police and CCTV cameras will not solve the migrant crisis at Calais, only Britain taking on its real responsibilities will, aid groups argue
The UK announced on Thursday that it will spend another €50 million, or a large part of that sum, on boosting security at the port of Calais, which for years, if not decades has been a jumping-off point for migrants and refugees attempting the often perilous journey across the Channel.
That brings the total amount of money the UK has spent on security at Calais in recent years to over €170 million.
London has built fences at the Eurotunnel port, paid for CCTV, extra police and detection technology to find out if anyone is hiding out in trucks. It has also paid €2.7 million for a much-criticized 4-metre high wall that stretches one kilometre along the approach road to Calais port, and helped pay for the dismantling of the infamous Jungle camp, once home to 10,000 people.
And yet the migrant crisis in Calais rumbles on with around 1,000 refugees camping out in and around the town in squalid conditions trying to escape the attention of riot police who have been confiscating their belongings and cutting up their sleeping bags.
""Increasing security to tackle the migrant crisis does not only not work in France, it doesn't work anywhere in the world,"" Franck Esnee, northern France's regional coordinator for charity Medecins du Monde told The Local on Thursday.
""More security doesn't stop people trying. You can put twice as much money into more police but you can't change the fact the UK is just 30km away across the Channel.
""We are convinced that spending more money on more security at the border will only mean more risk and more danger for the migrants,"" said Esnee.
""Despite the risks and the dangers in places like Libya, people are still making those journeys. Building walls in Calais or along the Mexico border won't stop people coming.
""We denounce this attitude towards security and this idea of creating a fortress around Europe's borders.""
Back in 2015 London stumped up €10 million for a new control centre at the port, as well as extra French policing units, additional freight searches, and tighter security at the entrance to the Channel Tunnel through more fencing, cameras, floodlighting and infrared detection technology.
That year Eurotunnel, which runs the Chanel Tunnel, demanded compensation after it incurred a security bill of €13 million after scores of disruptions caused by migrants on the train tracks as they attempted to get through the tunnel. Eurotunnel will no doubt be quite happy with the UK boosting security.
But while the French government and Eurotunnel might be happy to take the money, aid organisations have long lamented Britain's focus on security and little else.
“Up until now the British government has just chosen to throw money at the problem and pay for new security fences, but it's not enough,"" an aid worker in Calais told The Local previously.
Esnee says rather than spending the money on this side of the Channel, London should be simply use the money to take on its responsibilities in helping deal with the migrant crisis.
He argues the controversial 2003 Touquet agreement which allowed the UK to place its border on French soil has given successive British governments an excuse ""to stay in the shadows"" when it comes to the migrant crisis in France.
""The UK should be at the heart of the efforts to solve the crisis,"" he said.
On Thursday Britain was reminded of its promise to grant asylum to refugee children in Calais, a vow it has failed to keep, according to aid groups.
One of the other knock-on effects of spending so much money on security at Calais is that it persuades those intent on getting to the UK to try alternative routes.
Back in 2016 The Local reported that other Channel ports along the coast such as Ouistreham near Caen and Dieppe were seeing more and more migrants attempting to make the crossing.
The much-publicized closing of the Jungle camp in Calais also resulted in migrants heading to other ports. Many made their way to Dunkirk.
""If you create a blockage in Calais, which there already is, and if there's no legal way to demand asylum in the UK, then there are two effects,"" say Esnee.
""Firstly the refugees will seek the help of traffickers and secondly they will look to new ways to get across the Channel because they still want to get across to the UK.
""We have seen asylum seekers crossing the Alps in winter from Italy to France. Walls and police won't stop them.""
The migrant crisis has dominated the annual Franco-British summits in recent years and Medecins du Monde and other aid groups had hoped this one would have a different focus.
""We hope Theresa May and Emmanuel Macron will discuss how to invest this money on how migrants are treated and housed in France and on creating a legal route to the UK so people can be offered protection.
""We want the money spent on that rather than simply blocking them at the border."""

					08:31 CEST+02:00				",AFP,Hollande calls on EU to help Turkey's  refugees,"French President Francois Hollande said on Thursday that he will urge a special EU summit next week to help Turkey keep Syrian refugees on its soil until the neighbouring country's war ends.
The European Union must ""work with Turkey"" in order to ""ensure that those who are in Turkey can stay there, work there and have all the resources they need to wait until the situation in Syria is resolved"", Hollande told reporters in Modena, Italy, after holding talks with Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi.
Hollande said that aside from pledging assistance to Turkey, leaders attending next Wednesday's emergency EU summit on Europe's escalating migrant crisis must also set up ""hotspots"" or registration centres for asylum seekers.
They must also, he added, ensure countries where refugees had sought shelter before deciding to leave for Europe ""receive much more aid"".
Syria's four-year war has forced more than four million people to flee their country. Nearly half have sought shelter in Turkey, while more than a million are now living in Lebanon and nearly 630,000 in Jordan.
The journey from Turkey to Greece across the Aegean Sea has become one of the main routes for thousands of refugees and migrants wanting to start a new life in the European Union.
While many of them are from Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan, others are coming from countries in Africa.
In Modena, Hollande also said the European Union must also do more to assist African countries so that people do not feel forced to migrate in search of a better life."
