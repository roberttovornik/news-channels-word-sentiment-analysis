					14:21 CEST+02:00				",AFP,Four people injured in knife rampage in Dordogne,"An Afghan asylum-seeker was arrested after launching a drunken and frenzied knife attack in the sleepy southwestern French town of Perigueux, injuring four people including one seriously, police said Tuesday.
The incident began Monday evening with the 19-year-old man, who was known to have psychological problems according to local authorities, lashing out at cars outside his home.
The head of the ambulance service for the area, Jean-Jacques Girard, told the regional Sud-Ouest daily that he was seen “kicking and banging a first vehicle with his feet and fists, then a second” and also “rounding on female motorists.”
Two paramedics who witnessed the incident tried to calm the man down but after disappearing inside his home he returned with a knife and attacked them, leaving them with injuries to the head and neck.
He then turned on two brothers aged 64 and 68 living next door, leaving one with a perforated lung and the other with stab wounds to the back.
The man was eventually overpowered by one of the brothers and a man of Cameroonian origin, who stepped in to help wrestle his knife away.
Police arrested the man and placed him in custody on charges of aggravated violence.
They ruled out any terrorist motive.

The 38-year-old man, who was carrying a bottle, doused himself with petrol before setting himself on fire and suffered serious burns to his scalp and torso. Pascale Girault, the secretary general of the National Court of Asylum, said the man's first demand for asylum was rejected by the Office for the Protection of Refugees and Stateless People (OFPRA) a few months ago. ""He filed an appeal which was rejected"" by the court, Girault said. On Friday the man returned to the asylum court in the eastern Parisian suburb of Montreuil ""for information on how his situation could be re-examined."" When staff at the front desk explained the decision he ""doused himself in fuel and set fire to his clothes,"" said Girault. Security guards used a fire extinguisher to put out the flames, said a police source. In theory a request for asylum cannot be examined a second time unless the person furnishes new information, said a spokesman for OFPRA. A police source said the man had arrived in France via Syria. ""He was two metres from the front desk, looked at the notice board and doused himself with a large bottle filled with a transparent liquid,"" said Maya Lino, who witnessed the scene. ""His eyes were glazed. He pulled out a lighter, tried a first time, it didn't work and everyone screamed,"" she added. ""He tried again a second time and burst into flames all the way to his head. He began running."" Every year some 40,000 asylum seekers appeal to the court after their cases are denied by OFPRA. If the court rejects an appeal, the asylum seeker is usually expelled from France. ""Often the decisions of the court are perceived as dramatic and I understand that because they can end someone's life plans,"" said Pierre Henry, director of an organisation which supports asylum seekers. ""But this was a desperate act, which fortunately is an exception. We should put our feelings aside and not exploit this tragedy to challenge an entire process,"" he said.
Of the 38,540 decisions taken by the court last year, 108 concerned Chadians. It found in favour of only 17 of these applicants."

					17:42 CEST+02:00				",The Local,Here's what's wrong with France’s new immigration law - according to rights groups,"As parliament begins debating France’s controversial immigration bill, hundreds protested outside the Assemblée Nationale in Paris, while a major human rights group warned the proposed laws could ""punish"" asylum seekers by reducing their rights.
Critics say the bill is repressive, but the centrist government insists it is creating a more efficient system to sift out genuine refugees from those simply seeking a better life in France.
“Under the guise of providing a more effective asylum system, the bill includes a series of measures that would diminish access to protection,” said Bénédicte Jeannerod, France director at Human Rights Watch (HRW).
“If France intends to improve the efficiency of its asylum system, it should start by allocating sufficient resources to the existing system, and not punish asylum seekers for these deficiencies by truncating their rights,” she concluded in a statement from the group.
The concerns raised by rights groups such as HRW include the following:
Reduced period to apply for asylum means many migrants could miss the deadline
The bill would reduce the period for filing an asylum application from 120 days after entering French territory to 90 days. But asylum seekers already face major obstacles to filing their applications, and making the period shorter means more will likely miss the deadline.
Applications would still be able to be made after the 90 days, but these would likely be not examined thoroughly as the officials handling them would be inundated with cases, according to HRW.
Shortened deadline for asylum seekers to appeal rejection means many will lose out
The bill would reduce from one month to 15 days the time for asylum seekers to appeal if their request has been turned down. But many may lose out because that short time-frame is not sufficient to prepare for what can be a technical and complex procedure, often requiring legal support.
Deportation of rejected asylum seekers would no longer be suspended pending appeal
Asylum seekers can currently remain in France while their appeal of their rejected request is being examined. The new law would let the government deport them - if they are from what are deemed to be safe countries - while the appeal is being heard.
HRW says that removing the automatic suspension of deportation during an appeal means asylum seekers could be sent back to their country even if their claims of persecution have not been fully adjudicated.
Increased maximum detention period
The bill would increase the maximum administrative detention period for those awaiting deportation from 45 to 90 days. But HRW points out that data it has viewed shows that foreigners in mainland France in 2016 were expelled on average after 12 days of detention.
“The justification for this provision, much less the necessity, is therefore very much in doubt,” the rights group said.
Migrant children in detention
HRW laments that the draft law does not address the issue of the detention of migrant children, “when it could have been an opportunity for France to abolish this practice.” It noted that in six cases between 2012 and 2016 the European Court for Human Rights ruled hat France’s detention of children violated the prohibition on inhuman treatment or punishment."

					17:02 CEST+02:00				",The Local,France: 96 percent of asylum rejects stay,"France's asylum procedures have been slammed as too long and inefficient, with as many as 96 percent of refugees who are refused asylum not being deported, an official report found.
The damning report was made public on Tuesday by the top national auditing body, the Accounting Court (Cour des Comptes), and showed France's asylum system to be a sorry sight.
The court noted that France performed poorly compared to its European neighbours when it came to processing times for asylum seekers, who are forced to wait two years on average. The process in Germany, on the other hand, only takes one year.
French authorities have previously said they aim to reduce this waiting time to nine months, a move noted and welcomed by the court, which said that such long waiting times make it difficult to accurately assess the situations of those seeking asylum.
The documents also pointed out that a whopping 96 percent of refugees whose request for asylum is rejected aren't deported. It noted that of the 40,206 people whose request was rejected, only 1,432 people were actually deported.
The report didn't specify what became of those who stayed, though it's likely that many would have stayed to appeal the decision, or headed abroad of their own accord, or perhaps just ended up living on the streets, with authorities losing track of them.
The report also drew attention to France's considerably high rate of application rejections for asylum seekers at 74 percent.
Other points of contention included the high expenditure in social assistance and accommodation for asylum seekers, which was said to be €690 million in 2013, and which is estimated to have increased from 2009 to 2014 by 52 percent.
Prime Minister Manuel Valls was less than impressed with the report, writing in a response published on Tuesday that the authors' reasoning had been ""simplistic"".
He noted, for example, that the deportation figures didn't take into account voluntary departures by the asylum seekers or the fact that some succeeded in legally acquiring residency permits after appeal.
But, he added that the efficient treatment of asylum seekers was a priority for the government.
There were around 65,000 asylum seekers in France in 2014, a figure that is expected to remain stable in 2015."

With wars and conflicts raging worldwide, France granted asylum to 20,640 people last year, a rise of 27 percent year on year, new figures from Eurostat show.
Russians made up the largest group awarded protection status with 2,080 positive decisions, or 10.1 percent of the total. France also welcomed 2,015 Syrians and 1,685 people from Sri Lanka.
France rejected 78 percent of applicants in the first instance, with just 14,815 people out of a total 68,500 given protection status. A further 5,825 people were granted asylum on appeal.
More than 750,000 people have received asylum in the European Union since 2008, with Germany and Sweden consistently taking in more asylum seekers than any other countries.
Germany took in 47,555 asylum seekers last year, 82 percent more than the year before. Sweden accepted 33,000 applicants, up 25 percent on 2013.
Italy approved just ten fewer applicants than France.

					17:48 CEST+02:00				",The Local,France converts hotels into lodging for asylum seekers as Calais migrants crisis rumbles on,"France is being forced to convert former low-cost hotels around the country into accommodation for migrants seeking asylum due to the growing pressure on existing structures.
The scheme has been developed to deal with the huge shortage of housing for asylum seekers in France that has been exposed after authorities closed several refugee camps, in particular the notorious Calais ‘Jungle’ camp in October 2016.
The plan has been called “Prahda” (Program for reception and accommodation of asylum seekers), and is an initiative set up by the housing ministry which issued a call to authorities for an extra 5,351 emergency places back in September.
The centres will be temporary accommodation but with the aim of getting asylum seekers into more permanent accommodation.
Some of the accommodation converted for asylum seekers will be the budget Formule1 hotels. According to L'Express newspaper it will cost authorities €5,000 to covert each hotel room to suitable accommodation.
The state bought 62 Formule1 hotels earlier this year, but some will also be used to lodge vulnerable people.
Some 86,000 applications for asylum were recorded in France last year, but dedicated reception centres offer only 40,000 places.
But some are against the scheme of rehousing asylum seekers in small towns.
Stéphane Dupont-Ferrier, mayor of Fontanile (Isère) told L’Express newspaper: “96 people is an enormous number for our town of 2,800 inhabitants. It risks bringing trafficking and prostitution”.
Thierry Cozic, the socialist mayor of Arnage (Sarthe) said he is not against the welcome centers but said that “contrary to common sense” a center will be built near a tourist complex.
The desperate need for accommodation for migrants and asylum seekers in France comes after the Human Rights Chief, Jacques Toubon, expressed concern over the treatment of migrants still living in and around Calais.
Toubon was quoted in Le Monde saying that he was worried about the ""infringements of fundamental rights"" of about 600 migrants in the region of Calais who are waiting for their asylum application to be processed.
He denounced the ""inhuman living conditions” because migrants have a lack of access to food, water and shelter.
He visited migrants on 12th June and called the situation “incredibly serious”."

The historic rise in applications was revealed by figures released by the French Office for the Protection of Refugees (OFPRA).
France registered 100,412 applications in 2017 which came mostly from Albanians, Afghans and Africans.
This number represents a jump of 17 percent compared to 2016, which was already up 6.5 percent on the number of applications in the previous year.
On top of that, in 2015 applications increased by 22 percent during a year which saw an unprecedented number of people coming to Europe to claim asylum, according to a report in Le Parisien.
However Pascal Brice, director general of OFPRA told Le Parisien that this ""sustained"" increase is ""not representative of an inundation"".
Although Brice said the figures confirm that ""France is one of the top countries for asylum applications in Europe"" while noting that France has a way to go before it hits the number of requests seen by Germany which expects just short of 200,000 cases this year.

Of these applications received by France in 2017, 36 percent resulted in the applicant receiving refugee status compared to 38 percent in 2016.
The rise in asylum requests filed by Albanian and West African nationals has seen a particularly sharp rise.
Although Albania is on the list of ""safe countries of origin"", in 2016 Albanians accounted for the largest proportion of applications, making 7,630 requests (excluding accompanying minors).
This represented an increase of 66 percent.
The second largest number of requests came from Afghans, with 5,987 requests (up 6 percent) followed by Haitian nationals whose requests remained stable at 4,934.
Sudanese applications decreased by 24 percent to 4,486 in 2017, while Guinean applications numbered 3,780 (up 62 percent).
Meanwhile the average waiting time for the requests to be processed ""fell to almost three months,"" according to Brice.
OFPRA, he assured, ""continues its efforts to achieve in 2018 the goal of two months"" set by French President Emmanuel Macron in July, ""in strict compliance with the rights of each applicant.""
In December, Macron's government prompted fury among rights groups for saying it wanted to expel more failed asylum seekers and do it at a faster pace as a tough new bill on immigration is being thrashed out."

Norway's immigration services deported Simreth Wolbgeber and her family on March 12 to France, the European country responsible for processing their asylum claim under European Union rules. The family arrived in France early last year, after fleeing the repressive government in Eritrea, and it was there that they were first fingerprinted and registered as asylum seekers. The French authorities claim to be unable to find temporary accommodation for such a large family, and as a result have left Wolbgeber and her children stranded, sleeping on uncomfortable plastic seats in the airport lounge and depending on charity from the Red Cross as they wait for a place. ""To sit for so many days at an airport with eight children is inhuman. It is outrageous,"" Ranveig Kaldhol, a church social worker in Ulsteinvik, where Wolbgeber had been living, told The Local. ""It's terrible,"" Kaldhol added. ""They are innocent children and they haven't had one decent meal. They have been living on drinks, cup cakes and yoghurt given to them by the Red Cross, and they haven't had beds, or even a shower. The youngest is only five months old."" She argued that when children are involved the Norwegian authorities had a duty to liaise with a receiving country's immigration agencies. ""The Norwegian government, before they send children, they should know that there is someone to take care of them to give them at least the minimal protection,"" she said. ""They haven't done anything criminal, they have just asked for protection from Eritrea. That's their sin."" Geir Bang Danielsen, the deputy director of Norway's immigration police, told NRK that the responsibility for the family now lay with France's authorities. ""France is responsible for the family according to their duties under the Dublin cooperation,"" he said.

					15:11 CET+01:00				",Evie Burrows-Taylor,French government under fire for new crackdown on migrants,"Emmanuel Macron's French government wants to expel more failed asylum seekers and do it at a faster pace, which has prompted fury among rights groups and could cause a split in the president's own party as a tough new bill on immigration is being thrashed out.
France's Interior Minister Gerard Collomb has been criticised for taking a hard line on asylum seekers, with rights groups saying his actions represent a worrying shift in policy from the French government as it prepares its controversial ""asylum and immigration"" bill.
Collomb has come under fire for sending circulars to immigration authorities urging them ""to act quickly"" to expel migrants in an ""irregular situation"" and to create a census of the people living in France's emergency shelters.
Another recent circular urged checks to be carried on migrants who were being housed in emergency lodgings to evaluate their right to stay in France. Rights groups believe these checks are just a way of speeding up the process of kicking out asylum seekers.
""No previous government has gone as far as this, not even under Nicolas Sarkozy,"" said Clemence Richard from La Cimade, an association that supports migrants.
These instructions have come to light as the government prepares its bill on ""asylum and immigration"" which, although not yet published, has caused a backlash among rights groups in France.
According to reports; one of the aims of the bill is to reduce the average processing time of applications from fourteen months to six months.
But one of the major points of contention is the plan to extend the maximum period of detention for foreigners who have been expelled from 45 to 90 days. This, the government believes, will improve the effectiveness of evictions by giving the authorities more time.
Another controversial measure is the idea of ""safe third countries"". The government wants to be able to send migrants back to countries they have already passed through on their way to France.
The moves have shocked the left wing press who have been quick to point out the discrepancy between what Macron has said in the past and what he is doing on the issue.
In June, the French president told the Council of Europe: ""We have to welcome refugees, it's our duty and our honor.""
Macron however has made it clear on various occasion that those who don't have the right to stay in France cannot.
He provoked anger in November when he was approached by an undocumented Moroccan woman.
""If you are not in danger in your country then you must return home,"" he said.

Interior Minister Collomb defended what he calls a ""reasonable line"" on the matter in an interview with RTL on Monday.
""If we welcomed everyone, we could not welcome them in good conditions,"" he said. ""Today in France, we have 95,000 requests a year, that means the equivalent of a big city every year.""
The latest figures from the Ministry of the Interior on asylum applications show that 85,700 were issued in 2016.
""Today, we do not know who is in these emergency shelters,"" Collomb told RTL. ""It is estimated that about one third of the people are refugees who could be entitled to housing and have the right to a normal life, one third are asylum seekers who should be able to leave France, and another third are people whose situation must be evaluated.""
Collomb said that the government ""has decided to welcome those who are refugees from theatres of war, who are political prisoners"" but that it would also try to pursue ""a policy that allows economic migration to be managed differently"", referring to the government's ""asylum and immigration"" bill which has not yet been finalized.
He also confirmed the harder stance towards illegal immigration. ""Of course, I think that those who are denied the right to asylum must be expelled,"" he said, adding that more than 14 percent of those would be asked to leave France during the first eleven months of next year.

Rights groups are worried
Meanwhile rights groups are openly worried about what they see as a definite political shift from the government, with several associations including Cimade, Emmaus and Fondation Abbé Pierre calling on human rights defender Jacques Toubon to take a stance against the still unpublished bill.
Toubon said on Monday that Collomb's words represented ""a complete change in our policy"".
""What the government wants is more deportations: that people who do not have a title can be removed more effectively and quickly. The situation of vulnerable people is not [taken into account],"" he said.
Florent Gueguen from FAS (Federation des acteurs de la solidarité) says thousands of migrants will simply return to living on the streets if they feel the accommodation centres are like traps"".
And caution was recommended by another member of President Emmanuel Macron's La Republique en Marche! party.
""We must strengthen the measures with regard to illegal immigration and at the same time we must maintain this tradition of the right of asylum. But if we want it to work, we must welcome these people, which is not the case today,"" said Richard Ferrand, MP for Finistère in Brittany in an interview with BFMTV.
""We need to speed up the processing of asylum issues, and be firmer and give clear signals of illegal immigration,"" he said.

But this isn't the first time the Interior Minister has courted controversy for his approach to France's migrant situation.
In June, Collomb warned that Calais risked developing a ""migrant abscess"" and had previously argued that the provision of services could have a pull effect on migrants who trek across Europe to Calais in the hope of hiding away on a truck crossing the Channel to the UK.
The government later softened its tone, with Macron promising in August to find temporary shelter for all those on the streets by the end of the year.
In July, Human Rights Watch published a report called ""Like Living Hell"" which described the use of pepper spray against migrants massed in the northern coastal city as ""routine"".
In June, Macron told the Council of Europe: ""We have to welcome refugees, it's our duty and our honor."""

The government argues that tighter controls are needed to check the rise of anti-immigration populists, who are on the march across Europe from Berlin to
Budapest after suffering a setback in last year's French elections.
""I fear that if we do not resolve the problem facing us... others will do it without any humanity,"" Interior Minister Gerard Collomb said earlier this
month.
The bill aims to both cut waiting times for asylum applications -- from around a year currently to six months -- and make it easier to deport those
turned down as ""economic"" migrants.
The right-wing opposition say the bill is too soft but left-wing parties and NGOs have branded it repressive.
""We cannot take on the misery of the world,"" Macron, who campaigned as a champion of open borders but has adopted a tough line on migration since
taking office, said in an interview with BFMTV on Sunday.

Protest outside the French parliament against the new immigration bill. Photo: AFP
Macron pointed to the ""ticking bomb"" of population growth in Africa, wars and climate change among factors that would continue driving migration to
Europe in the years to come.
Faced with an ""unprecedented"" wave of arrivals the government would focus on welcoming those whose lives were at risk in their country of origin, he
said firmly.
France received a record 100,000 asylum applications last year, bucking the general trend in Europe, where the number of asylum seekers halved between
2016 and 2017.
A shortage of accommodation means many wind up on the streets of Paris, or the northern port of Calais, a gateway to Britain, where a squalid camp
housing thousands of migrants was razed by the state in late 2016.
A February survey by pollsters BVA showed 63 percent of voters felt there were too many immigrants in France, home to around six million people who were
born in another country.
'Unworthy of France'
On Monday, France's human rights ombudsman Jacques Toubon slammed the ""unacceptable conditions"" facing around 1,000 migrants packed into a new
tented camp along a canal in northeast Paris.
""We cannot remain on this path which is unworthy of France's welcoming tradition and increasingly difficult for some of our fellow citizens,"" Collomb, one of the more hawkish figures in Macron's left-right administration, argued in parliament this week.
The bill doubles the time that failed asylum seekers can be detained to 90 days, making it easier to deport them.
It also reduces the time they have to lodge their application from 120 to 90 days and gives them just two weeks to appeal if unsuccessful, a period slammed by NGOs as far too short to gather more evidence in support of their claim.
Once accepted, however, refugees will be given more help to integrate, by, for instance, gaining the right to work and being given more French classes.

The government has defended the legislation as balanced but several members of Macron's usually compliant Republic on the Move (LREM) party have vowed to reject the bill or abstain when it is put to a vote Friday.
""This bill stigmatises foreigners,"" Francois-Michel Lambert, a LREM lawmaker representing the southern Bouches-du-Rhone region, told BFMTV.
Delphine Bagarry, an MP representing Alpes-de-Haute-Provence, told France Inter radio that while she supports the need to shorten the agonising wait for
asylum, ""it cannot be at the expense of their right to a defence"".
Fearing that any sign of weakness could embolden dissidents to break ranks on other issues, party leader Richard Ferrand has threatened LREM naysayers
with expulsion.
But the bill is expected to pass, despite strong opposition from far-right leader Marine Le Pen -- the runner-up to Macron in last year's election -- and
the conservative opposition Republicans.
The Republicans' hardline leader Laurent Wauquiez charged that Macron's presidency was on course to legalise ""a million more immigrants"" by 2022.
Right-wingers have also argued that provisions allowing underage refugees to bring siblings to live with them in France will have a ""pull effect"" on migration.

With one group of Syrian refugees recently claiming they were treated ‘worse than animals’ in France, and after a French EU official this week warned European countries they should prepare for a “massive influx” of Syrians fleeing the bloody conflict, the arrival of refugees from the Middle East looks set to be a major issue in France in the coming months. On Thursday The Local spoke to Matthieu Tardis, head of the Secretariat General of France Terre d’Asile, a leading non-profit organisation which provides “legal and social services” to asylum-seekers and refugees in France. He told us that France was failing to meet its legal obligations to Syrian refugees, and that there was a “moral crisis” in France, regarding refugees and immigration. How has France been treating Syrian refugees? Matthieu Tardis. Photo: Screengrab/TV5Monde Quite simply, France is not doing enough to help and accommodate Syrian refugees fleeing the conflict in their country. President François Hollande has tried to make France a world leader by getting involved in the conflict in Syria. But France’s system for welcoming refugees and asylum-seekers displaced by that conflict is just as important to being a proactive participant in the international community. I think the French people and authorities sometimes misunderstand asylum-seekers and refugees. They see it as an immigration issue, with thousands of people coming over the border into France, to stay permanently. Of course it’s true that it involves people entering France, but this is a protection issue, not an immigration issue. The Syrian refugees we speak with are not your typical migrants, looking to start a new life in France. They are in an exceptional position, and most of them simply want to go home as soon as they can. How France treats Syrian refugees will be a big part of how France helps to resolve the conflict in Syria, and I think there’s a moral crisis in France today when it comes to immigration and asylum-seekers. SEE ALSO: 'In France, animals are treated better than us.' Syrian refugees demand UK asylum What exactly should France be doing for Syrian refugees? Syria is in conflict at the moment. That means there are special rules and moral and legal obligations that apply to the international community. A major part of that obligation is housing and health services, and France is simply not providing that properly for refugees. I understand there has been an economic crisis, and I understand that the welcoming centres are already overcrowded, but that still doesn’t change France’s legal obligation to find a solution and provide accommodation for them. France receives about 50 or 60,000 asylum applications every year, and those figures have been steady for a while now.
So it’s just false to claim that French authorities have been taken by surprise by the numbers of asylum seekers. Furthermore, France only grants about 10 percent of those asylum applications, as opposed to the European average of 20 percent. Another important step France could take is to proactively try to get Syrian refugees from overcrowded camps in Lebanon and elsewhere, and bring them safely to France. Germany is doing this, so why can’t France? There are more than two million refugees from Syria currently in camps in Lebanon, Jordan and Turkey, and this is putting a massive burden on these countries. We’re already hearing stories about trouble on the Greek border with Turkey, where Syrian refugees are trying to enter the EU through Greece. France could play a big role in alleviating these tensions. SEE ALSO: Minister's fears over 300 French militants fighting in Syria Has France done anything to help Syrian refugees? Of course. Towards the beginning of the conflict in Syria, France was very good about granting what are called “protection visas.” This means that Syrians fleeing the conflict in their country were given sanctuary on French territory within Syria, in the French embassy. Also, as is their legal obligation, France has been giving “transit visas” to Syrian refugees. This means that if they want to pass through France to another country, the French authorities have to allow them to do so. In terms of asylum, France has only received about 800 applications from Syrian citizens this year, and more than 90 percent of those have been granted, and usually processed quite quickly. It would be unfair to criticize France based on the number of applications it has received. If more Syrian refugees are asking for asylum status in other countries like Germany, that’s their choice. The Syrian refugees who protested at Calais had family connections in the UK, and generally spoke better English than French. That’s why they were so keen to cross the Channel to go to Britain. France can’t be blamed for that, but without a doubt, it must do more to welcome, house and help those Syrian refugees who do arrive here.

England's watchdog for children urged the French authorities on Saturday to speed up processing the cases of lone child asylum seekers who may be eligible to join family in Britain.
Anne Longfield, the Children's Commissioner for England, wrote to the French government concerning an estimated 150 unaccompanied minors in a refugee camp in Calais, on the northeast French coast across the Channel from Britain.
Under European regulations known as Dublin III, child asylum seekers can have their claims transferred to another European Union country if they have relatives there.
Longfield's office said charities claimed some of the children were as young as 10, and had ""fled war and fighting in countries such as Syria"".
Over one million people fleeing war and poverty flowed into Europe last year, setting the stage for Europe's worst migrant crisis since World War II.
Longfield said: ""I have asked the French authorities to urgently determine which of the children in the Calais refugee camp are eligible to come to the UK, to ensure their safety and to process their applications immediately.
""It is unacceptable that at the moment some are waiting up to nine months before they learn whether or not they can come.
""The camp is an incredibly dangerous place for an unaccompanied child.""
She asked the authorities in France to establish a dedicated centre to process the children's asylum applications and for them to be addressed urgently.
""Whilst in the camp, the children have been exposed to trafficking, violence, abuse and illness,"" her office said, adding that some had attempted to enter Britain illegally by hiding in trucks.
But Fabienne Buccio, head of the Pas-de-Calais prefecture, said she was ""amazed"" by the criticism.
""The delays of nine months mentioned in the letter have no basis in reality,"" she wrote in a statement, pointing out that a British border official had been dispatched to Calais with the sole purpose of speeding up such applications.
As a result, 22 lone-children had had their claims accepted, 12 of whom were already in Britain, and more were expected in the near future, said Buccio."

The crisis also threatens to hijack a summit in Vienna of leaders from the western Balkans region which Chancellor Angela Merkel is set to attend.
""We must put in place a unified system for the right to asylum,"" French President Francois Hollande said in a brief statement ahead of talks with Merkel, calling the influx from the world's crisis zones ""an exceptional situation that will last for some time"".
""Rather than wait, we should organize and reinforce our policies, and that is what France and Germany are proposing,"" Hollande said.
More than 1,000 migrants and refugees arrived in EU member Hungary late on Monday, the first in a wave of about 7,000 people who found their gruelling journey to Europe blocked last week, when Macedonia declared a state of emergency and closed its Greek border for three days.
An AFP photographer witnessed them finally arrive in Hungary from Serbia via a cross-border railway track, close to the southern Hungarian village of Roszke.
Their crossing comes just days before the Hungarian government deadline of August 31st for the completion of a razor-wire barrier along the length of its southern border with Serbia - which is not a member of the EU - in a bid to keep migrants out.
EU border agency Frontex said last week that a record 107,000 migrants were at the bloc's borders last month, with 20,800 arriving in Greece last week alone.
'Disastrous' economic situation
But it's not just about people fleeing violence in places like Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan. The impoverished countries in the western Balkans are themselves the source of huge numbers of migrants.
Of the 44,000 irregular migrants detected crossing between western Balkan countries and between these countries and the EU in the first quarter of 2015, 27,000 were nationals of the region, according to Frontex.
According to Dusan Reljic at the German Institute for International and Security Affairs (SWP), this is because the economic situation there is ""disastrous"", with growth non-existent, unemployment sky high and investment feeble.
""In Macedonia the average monthly salary is €350, less than in China,"" the Balkans expert told AFP. ""Something like half of the people applying for asylum in Germany are from the western Balkans.""
The credibility of prospects of these countries joining the EU ""has largely evaporated, and the poorest of the poor have abandoned hopes of improvement and ever achieving a life with dignity.""
Safe countries of origin
But Hollande and Merkel reiterated their calls on Monday for Brussels to draw up a list of safe countries of origin.
Germany in particular sees this as a priority, as 40 percent of its asylum-seekers come from countries such as Albania and Kosovo.
Merkel is travelling on Thursday to Vienna, where she will meet Balkan leaders to find out why ""so many thousands of people are coming from these countries"", her spokesman Steffen Seibert said.
Other coordinated action sought by Hollande and Merkel includes the rapid setting up of reception centres in overwhelmed Greece and Italy – two countries that have borne the brunt of the crisis – to help identify asylum-seekers and illegal migrants.
Merkel stressed that the centres must be set up at the first ports of call to be administered and staffed by the EU as a whole by the end of the year.
""We cannot tolerate a delay,"" she said.
Violence against refugees
Merkel also condemned on Monday continued attacks against refugee and asylum-seeker homes that Germany has seen again this week, beginning with violent riots in Heidenau, Saxony over the weekend.
Two different intended asylum-seeker homes went up in flames so far this week, one building in Unterweissach, Baden-Württemberg on Monday and another in Nauen, Brandenburg on Tuesday.
The fire in Unterweissach left the asylum home completely destroyed, but no one was injured. The incident is under investigation and police said they had not ruled out arson.
The Nauen fire began just days before asylum-seekers would have moved in.
Police in Brandenburg said the fire was most likely not caused by a technical problem in the building and that they were investigating whether it was arson."

					09:01 CEST+02:00				",AFP,From migration to defence: Germany and France announce EU reform ideas,"France's President Emmanuel Macron and Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel on Tuesday announced common plans on a plethora of EU reforms ahead of a crunch end-June summit that could determine the future of the bloc.
Here's an outline of Europe's two biggest economies' proposals for a post-Brexit Europe:
Migration
A record influx of migrants, many fleeing war in Syria and Iraq, has become a defining issue for politics in many EU nations.
Merkel is facing down a domestic rebellion over her liberal policy that led to the arrival of more than a million asylum seekers since 2015, while Italy last week sparked an outcry by refusing aid ships carrying rescued migrants to dock in its ports.
Coming to Merkel's aid, Macron said that Paris and Berlin had agreed that EU countries must be able to turn back at their borders all asylum seekers who previously registered in another member country -- usually their Mediterranean first port of call.
Merkel, asked earlier what Berlin can offer other EU countries in return for such cooperation, cited the EU-Turkey deal in which the bloc paid Ankara for housing and schooling refugees.
They are also calling for a European Asylum Office that harmonizes practices across the bloc, and which will be responsible for ""asylum procedures at external borders"".
Meanwhile, Paris and Berlin also vowed steps to better protect the EU's outside borders by boosting the Frontex agency, to fight human traffickers and create a fairer system of burden-sharing within the bloc.
The German leader had initially championed a quota system to distribute migrants across the bloc, but this has been torpedoed by several central European nations.

Economy
Macron's ambitious ideas for a eurozone finance minister or parliament have been shot down by Berlin.
But the French leader won Merkel's backing for a eurozone budget which will be used to finance things like projects on innovation and education in poorer EU countries.
The eurozone budget will have its own governance structure, and be a ""real budget with annual revenues and spending"", said Macron, adding that Paris and Berlin hoped to have it in place by 2021.
He would however not be drawn into giving a figure for the budget, saying that its size would be discussed with other members of the bloc.
How it would be funded was also up for discussion with other eurozone members, said Merkel, suggesting that it could involve regular transfers made by individual countries or a tax on financial transactions.
Macron had previously called for a budget of several hundred billion, while Merkel has spoken of some tens of billions of euros.
Beyond that, in order to better cope with future crises, the two leaders agreed to expand the remit of the current European Stability Mechanism (ESM).
The twin EU engines now want the ESM to become a European version of the International Monetary Fund that could provide emergency loans to countries that fall victim to crises not linked to their debt levels.
Defence
In the face of US President Donald Trump's ""America First"" policy, a traditionally pacifist and Atlanticist post-war Germany has drawn closer to France's call for a sovereign Europe, including in the military aspect.
Merkel backs Macron's idea for an European intervention initiative, with armies to collaborate before eventually forming a common force.
But France wants this force outside the framework of the EU, to allow Britain to join in even after it leaves the bloc.
Germany prefers it to remain within the EU.
As a compromise, both sides agreed for the force to be ""linked as closely as possible"" with the EU's framework.

					15:50 CEST+02:00				",AFP,Hollande rejects migrant quotas for Europe,"UPDATED: French President Francois Hollande said on Tuesday there was ""no question"" of introducing a migrant quota system in Europe, as proposed by the European Commission.
Speaking at a joint press conference with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Hollande said there was ""no question of having immigrant quotas"" because rules on border checks and policies for controlling immigration already existed.
The European Commission's plan, unveiled last week, called for asylum grants for 20,000 refugees in Europe over the coming years.
Each EU country should accept their fair share of asylum seekers, the commission said, based on a series of factors, such as that country's population, economic output, and unemployment rates.
France would be asked to take in 14.17 percent of all asylum seekers to reach the EU, second only to Germany at 18.42 percent. Italy at just under 12 percent and Spain at 9 percent were close behind.
Hollande continued:
""People who come because they think that Europe is a prosperous continent, even when they are not hired by companies... must be escorted back, that's the rule.""
""So one cannot talk of quotas, there can't be quotas for these migrants,"" he said, adding that quotas for ""the right to asylum"" would not make sense.
However, with refugees arriving in great numbers in certain countries, Hollande said, citing Germany, France or Sweden, ""we must ensure that other countries can also play their part.
""This is what we call distribution,"" Hollande said.
The proposal was already opposed by France's Prime Minister Manuel Valls over the weekend.
""I am against the introduction of quotas for migrants. This has never been in line with French proposals,"" he told reporters.
Valls said that France had ""already done a lot"" when it came to helping asylum seekers, pointing to the fact that 5,000 refugees from Syria and 4,500 from Iraq had been resettled in Frace since 2012.
""Asylum is a right, attributed according to international criteria ... That is why the number of its beneficiaries cannot be subject to quotas, one is an asylum seeker or not,” he added.
The Commission plan last week came amid concerns at the growing numbers of refugees, especially from war-torn countries like Syria, after weeks in which hundreds have died attempting to cross the Mediterranean Sea by boat to reach the continent.
Other proposals within the plan include better targeting of people smugglers, whose unsafe and over-crowded boats have been blamed for recent tragedies, and expanding resources for search and rescue."

France's Manuel Valls and Hans-Peter Friedrich of Germany said Brussels had to increase aid to the two nations to stop the phenomenon, which was stretching the resources of their countries. ""Our two countries have been subject to a worrisome trend: a flood of asylum seekers from countries which have recently benefited from an easing of visa rules,"" Valls told France's Le Figaro and German newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung. ""Their nationals can move in the Schengen zone freely. This rush of asylum demands, often groundless, is threatening our system,"" he said, when asked specifically about Bosnians and Macedonians. Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia were granted visa-free status by the European Union in December 2009, thereby allowing their citizens to travel unhampered in the passport-free Schengen zone. Valls complained that domestic laws forced the two countries – the economic heavyweights of the eurozone – to house and feed the asylum seekers ""even though it's almost sure that their demand will be rejected."" ""This problem should be met with a European response,"" he said. Friedrich said the European Union ""could offer Serbia and Macedonia adequate aid."" He said if this did not resolve the problem, the visa-free travel would be lifted in line with decisions taken in the European Council. ""There, that's our message to Serbia and Macedonia. We are asking these two countries to resolve the problem."" In a separate interview on German broadcaster ARD, Friedrich said the two nations had to better integrate their sizeable Roma population into the mainstream. ""If they want to belong to Europe, they must cooperate on who ultimately takes care of these people,"" he said. ""They have to do things so that these people ... don't feel discriminated against.""

The two European powerhouses said there was insufficient ""balance"" in the European Commission's controversial emergency measures for relocating tens of thousands of migrants around Europe.
""Deep discussions are necessary at the European level"" to achieve a balance between ""responsability"" and ""solidarity"", said a joint statement from the French and German interior ministers, who said countries' ""efforts already undertaken"" in welcoming asylum-seekers should be ""better taken into account"".
Brussels released plans for EU countries to open doors to around 60,000 refugees - 40,000 who are arriving or set to arrive in Italy and Greece and to grant asylum to another 20,000 who are currently outside the EU.
France was told to open its doors over 9,000 refugees over the next two years, with Germany's figure closer to 12,000.
The mandatory relocation scheme which will apply to refugees from Syria and Eritrea to relieve the pressure on Greece and Italy, is only intended for those “in clear need of international protection” and will be put in place for two years.
With each country effectively given a quota, France has been told to take in 4,000 migrants fleeing Africa and the Middle East who have arrived in Italy and another 2,700 that have spilled across the border into Greece - meaning almost 7,000 in total.
That compares to Germany which has been set a quota of 8,700 from the two countries and Sweden which must take in around 1,300 migrants from Italy and Greece.
The quotas were worked out on a special calculation that looked at each country's population size, GDP, unemployment rate and the number of refugees it had already accepted.
But Paris and Berlin said: ""Additional solidarity is only possible if the member states at the first point of entry... take, with support from the European budget, all the financial and legal measures possible to boost surveillance of the external borders.""
France and Germany proposed the establishment of so-called ""hotspots"" to process asylum-seekers close to the point of entry to identify them and then decide where to place them.
""Part of the asylum-seekers in obvious need of protection will be relocated in other member states, using the redistribution ratio agreed,"" said the Franco-German proposal.
""Irregular migrants"" will quickly be returned or removed, according to the proposal, adding that ""better contacts"" needed to be established with their countries of origin to ensure an easier returns process.
""Migrants that do not belong in either category will have their situation examined within the framework of the common asylum procedures, in the country of first entry,"" proposes the Franco-German plan.
Additionally, the two countries called for ""solutions to limit secondary migration movements"" which is putting at risk the idea of sharing the burden between EU states.
French president François Hollande has recently said that he was against any kind of migrant quotas, echoing concerns raised in both Spain and the UK.
""People who come because they think that Europe is a prosperous continent, even when they are not hired by companies... must be escorted back, that's the rule,"" said Hollande.

Le Point did not reveal any details of the threat but said all the major actors involved in the fight against terrorism were present at Wednesday's meeting.
At the meeting it was decided that the usual river police boat would be boosted by presence of specialist SWAT teams from the BRI brigade, who are called on when a terror attack or siege is underway.
It is not clear whether Wednesday's meeting was directly linked to an alert that was put out on Tuesday regarding an Afghan asylum seeker, suspected of intending to launch an attack.

A “logic of suspicion” towards foreigners impinges upon even the most basic rights of those not born in France, from asylum seekers trying to enter the country, to foreigners already living in France and suffering from discrimination.
These are the findings of a damning report published on Monday by France's Défenseur des droits, an Ombudsman tasked with protecting the rights of French citizens.
Jacques Toubon, the Défenseur des droits, urged France to tackle the “preconceived ideas” and “myths” about foreigners which lead to discrimination, such as the idea of the “French identity” being under threat by mass migration.
The first part of the 305-page report focussed on the foreigners entering the country and the issuing of French visas, while the second part examined the rights of those foreigners already living in France.
“No historical period of immigration, however intense, has changed the basis for the common Republican values,"" said the report, adding: ""Immigration is essential for the construction of France”.
The Ombudsman was critical of the newly made EU-Turkey deal on refugees, and criticized France for reducing legal migration channels in the midst of the Syrian crisis.
It claims that there had been ""violations of the law"" in issuing visas and barriers to the right to seek asylum at the border, also argued that those seeking asylum were ""deprived of rights"" in waiting areas and forced to wait for ""excessive"" lengths of time for their claims to be processed.
The report argued that even the vocabulary used by the media and the French public to refer to migrants led to ""discredit and suspicion"" of those trying to move to France, by creating distinctions ""between 'good' refugees and 'bad' economic migrants"".
Toubon highlighted the plight of unaccompanied child refugees and the ""worrying"" lack of a specific procedure to help them, saying: “These minors should be protected unconditionally - which is not always the case.”
The report argued that the suspicion towards foreigners affects not only France’s immigration policy, but also the everyday life of foreigners living in France, denouncing ""the measurable gap between the proclamation of rights and their effectiveness.”
As well as ""illegal practices"", Toubon points out that different interpretations of the law, or limiting criteria not related to nationality, can also limit the access of non-nationals to basic services. He called on the Interior Minister to intervene and ""prevent the spread of divergent interpretations of the law"" across the country at a local level.
The report highlighted a range of issues faced by foreigners, including children with non-resident or homeless parents being unable to enroll in the school system, spouses of French citizens facing a ""precarious right of residence"" if they suffer domestic violence, and ""barriers"" stopping foreigners from benefitting from family benefits or free healthcare - or even from accessing the competitive job market.
""The fact that the law and practices perceive individuals as 'foreign' before considering them for who they are as people, children, invalids, workers or users of public services, significantly weakens their access to basic rights.""

France unveiled plans on Wednesday to add 10,500 additional housing spots for migrants as European nations grapple with how to handle a wave of immigrants crossing the Mediterranean.
The government plans 5,000 housing units for people granted asylum in France, 4,000 for asylum seekers and 1,500 emergency slots for illegal immigrants.
France's Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve said the government aimed to create ""additional housing spots for those thrown into exile by persecution, abuse, imprisonment and execution.""
""France is doing its part,"" he insisted, amid a spat with neighbouring Italy, which has urged its fellow EU countries to do more to ease the burden. In seven years, the number of asylum seekers has nearly doubled in France to reach more than 66,000 cases in 2013.
As a result, there is a severe lack of housing facilities and half of all asylum seekers have to fend for themselves, resorting to living in slums, squats or sleeping rough.
Processing these asylum requests takes an average of two years, and legislation proposed in July aimed to shorten the wait to nine months by 2017, giving authorities dealing with the cases more funding and staff.
The managing director of France Terre d'Asile, a group representing asylum seekers, greeted the news cautiously.
""It is a sweeping plan of a type that has never been put into place until now,"" said Pierre Henry.
He added the increase in housing would require close vigilance as the plan will involve a variety of players from around the country.
The announcement comes as Italy has been increasingly applying pressure to other European Union nations to take in their share of the waves of migrants arriving on its shores.
But at a meeting Tuesday in Luxembourg, European interior ministers failed to reach an agreement on carrying out proposals by the European Commission for quotas to redistribute migrants throughout the bloc.
European leaders swore action after an estimated 800 migrants died in a shipwreck in April, the worst disaster yet in the Mediterranean in a year in which a total of 1,800 people have died trying to reach Europe.
More than 100,000 migrants have arrived in Europe this year, 60,000 through Italy alone, according to the EU's border agency Frontex.
Migrants in France have been a contentious issue lately. Shortly after the EU suggested France take in 9,000 migrants over the next two years, French authorities demanded the EU revise its figures, claiming there is an imbalance that needs to be addressed.
Two separate migrant camps have been closed down by police in recent weeks, both prompting protests from the French public."

""Emergency services are at the scene and are dealing with the situation in close cooperation with port staff. ""Thirteen of the asylum seekers are non-critical but two have been taken to hospital. ""Two drivers are in custody.""
He declined to comment on where the asylum seekers may have come from. Services from the port were not disrupted by the discovery on the ferry, which travels between Dover and Calais in northeast France, the spokesman said. In 2000 the bodies of 58 Chinese illegal immigrants were found in a lorry at the port. The victims suffocated after they were smuggled into Britain in a sealed container."

					14:40 CEST+02:00				",AFP,Doubts over Macron's plan for asylum checks in Libya,"French President Emmanuel Macron on Thursday unveiled plans to set up migrant registration centres in Libya to help stem an influx that has sparked a crisis in Europe, although his aides said the scheme could not be implemented there immediately for security reasons.
A presidency official said the plan - for which Macron set the goal of becoming operational ""this summer"" - ""was not possible at the moment"" because of security in Libya.
Instead, France would study the feasibility of setting up migrant ""hotspot"" centres in Niger and Chad, and aim to open similar sites in Libya ""in the short term"".
Macron had said earlier on Thursday that he wanted to set up processing centres in Libya ""to avoid people taking crazy risks when they are not all eligible for asylum"".
Speaking during a visit to a refugee shelter in Orleans in central France, Macron said the plan would be put in place ""this summer"", with or without other EU countries.
Libya is the main launchpad for African migrants trying to reach Europe across the Mediterranean in rickety boats operated by smugglers that frequently sink.

""We have between 800,000 and a million people in Libya - in camps, hangars, there's not even a minimum of humanity,"" Macron said.
He said other European countries were ""very reticent"" to set up registration centres, adding: ""We'll try to do it with Europe but we in France will do it.""
But his announcement seemed to take the European Commission by surprise and Human Rights Watch expressed serious concerns about the plan.
Judith Sunderland, HRW's Associate Director for Europe, said: ""It carries the risk of human rights abuses and loss of dignity for the people involved.""
Hours after the original announcement, a French presidency official explained that ""Libya is not possible at the moment, but it could be possible in the short term. Does that remove the ambition to create this sort of centre in Libya? No.
""The important thing is to ensure the security of people who will work there and of the migrants,"" the official added.
Libya is rife with lawlessness since the 2011 uprising ousted longtime dictator Moamer Kadhafi and created a power vacuum.
Macron's announcement came two days after he brokered talks in Paris between the leaders of the two rival authorities in Libya. He said then that he hoped the ceasefire deal between the UN-backed Prime Minister Fayez al-Sarraj and Khalifa Haftar, the military commander based in the remote east, would stem the outflow of migrants from Libya.
Since January, more than 100,000 people have made the perilous voyage across the Mediterranean, according to the International Organization for Migration (IOM). Over 2,300 have drowned in the attempt.
The vast majority land in Italy, which has complained of a lack of solidarity from its neighbours in dealing with the influx.
Macron on Thursday phoned Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni to discuss events, a presidential aide said.
The two ""shared a certain degree of optimism after the (Paris meeting), reaching very similar conclusions,"" the source said, adding that Macron also briefed Gentiloni on his plans for registration centres.
'No one in the street'
France's new leader has taken an ambivalent line on migration.
During his campaign he was fulsome in his praise of German Chancellor Angela Merkel's open-door policy but his government has taken a hard line with young migrants sleeping rough on the streets of the northern French port of Calais.
But in a speech on Thursday at a citizenship ceremony for families in the central city of Orleans, Macron adopted a more compassionate tone.
""I want no one in the streets or in the forests by the end of the year,"" he said, promising ""dignified"" accommodation for all those who made it to France while their cases were assessed.
He reiterated a pledge to slash the average processing time for an asylum claim from 18 months to six.
But he also warned that those who were fleeing poverty, rather than war or persecution, faced disappointment.
""No country can take all the economic migrants,"" he said.

					12:44 CET+01:00				",The Local,Immigration in France in ten stats that matter,"What percentage of the French population comes from immigrants and how many immigrants end up becoming French? As a new global report on immigration was released on Monday, The Local looks at the case of France in ten key stats.
A new global report was released on Monday, which revealed the countries migrants are heading to and in what kind of numbers. The report from the economic think-tank OECD in Paris was released days after France’s own national statistics agency INSEE published its own figures on immigration in France. The Local takes a look at ten of the most significant stats to give a picture of immigration in France. 1. Almost a tenth of France’s population are immigrants: 8.8 percent to be exact. From 2004 to 2012 an average of 200,000 migrants arrived on French shores every year. Take into account those who left or died and the figure stands at around 90,000 new immigrants every year. 2. Nearly half of all new immigrants in France are European: Contrary to popular belief, Africans do not represent the biggest new immigrant group in France. According to France’s national statistics body INSEE, in 2012 they made up 30 percent of new arrivals from abroad whereas Europeans accounted for 46 percent. 3. More Portuguese than any other nationality: Eight percent of France’s migrant population in 2012 was born in Portugal, more so than people from former French colonies Morocco and Algeria (seven percent each). Brits and Spaniards (five percent each) as well as Italians and Germans (four percent each) made up the largest migrant groups on French soil. 4. Immigration from Europe started rising sharply in 2009: Crisis-hit Europeans started arriving in droves in France in 2009. Going from 88,820 new arrivals in 2009 to 105,830 in 2012, migration from other European countries has seen a much more pronounced increase than from any other continent. 5. China is the main country of origin for foreign students: Although the number of foreign students who were granted residence in 2012 dropped by ten percent, a total of 10,100 Chinese nationals completed their studies in French institutions, more than a sixth of the total. They were followed by Moroccans (6,000) and Americans (3,800).
SEE ALSO: 'No study ever showed migration was not beneficial for France' 6. France is the world’s fourth most popular destination country: ""After the United States, Germany is now the OECD's second most important destination country,” the Paris-based think tank reported. Trailing behind is the UK in third place and then France in fourth. 7. More people than ever expelled: There were a total of 23,000 expulsions from French soil in 2012, a nine percent rise compared to the previous year. Up to 4,300 of these cases were however through voluntary return assistance. A reduction in the final contribution provided in such cases led to a drop in the number of immigrants who chose to leave in 2013. 8. One in four asylum seekers got residency: In 2012 41,000 adults applied for asylum alongside 14,000 minors. A total of 14,000 (including minors) of these were granted residency. The biggest asylum seeker groups hailed from the Democratic Republic of Congo, Russia, Sri Lanka, Serbia and Montenegro, and China. 9. More families reunited: 163,000 new non-EEA immigrants arrived on French shores in 2012 to stay thanks to a seven percent increase in admissions for family reunification. Most of these third-country nationals granted permanent residence were North African: Moroccan (20,200 people), Algerian (25,000) and Tunisian (12,000). 10. More migrants arriving, fewer becoming French: According to INSEE, France’s immigrant population is rising at an average of 1.6 percent per year. But that doesn’t translate to more foreigners being granted French citizenship. In 2012, naturalizations declined to 96,000 cases, 16 percent fewer than in 2011. The OECD puts the drop down to stricter requirements for language examinations among other eligibility conditions. By Alex Dunham"

					17:14 CEST+02:00				",AFP,Macron's party divided as France debates immigration law,"French lawmakers were set to vote Sunday on a controversial immigration law that has exposed unprecedented divisions in President Emmanuel Macron's young centrist party.
At least one MP, Jean-Michel Clement, is planning to vote against the law -- at a cost of being kicked out of Macron's En Marche (Republic On The Move) party -- while several others said they would abstain.
The lower-house national assembly was supposed to vote on the bill Friday, but the fractious debate stretched into the weekend due to more than 1,000 amendments proposed by MPs.
More than 200 of the changes were suggested by En Marche members as Macron's own MPs openly challenged his plans to double the maximum time migrants can be held in detention to 90 days.
The government defends the bill as balanced, but it has attracted criticism both from rightwingers who say it is too soft and leftwingers who have blasted it as repressive.
Interior Minister Gerard Collomb said it aims for ""better controlled"" immigration, halving the waiting time for asylum applications to six months while also making it easier to deport those turned down as ""economic""
migrants.
Accepted refugees will be given more help to integrate, such as better access to work and French lessons.
Many left-wing opponents lashed out in parliament at measures to keep asylum seekers awaiting deportation, including children, in detention for up to 90 days.
""Nothing justifies locking up a kid,"" said Socialist MP Herve Saulignac.
The bill also reduces the time that asylum-claimers have to lodge their application from 120 to 90 days and gives them two weeks to appeal if unsuccessful, which NGOs say is not enough to gather more evidence in support of their claim.
Despite rumblings of revolt, the bill is expected to pass, with En Marche holding more than half the seats after battering traditional parties in June's parliamentary elections.
France received a record 100,000 asylum applications last year, bucking the general trend in Europe where the number of asylum seekers halved between 2016 and 2017.
Many Africans and South Asians end up sleeping on the streets of Paris due to a shortage of accommodation, or camping out in Calais hoping to stow away on trucks to Britain.
Pressure over the immigration bill comes as Macron insists he will push on with sweeping reforms including an overhaul of state rail operator SNCF, despite strikes and street protests.
Monday sees the start of another two days of strikes by rail workers over the shake-up which have been causing havoc for French commuters two days out of five since the start of April.
Rail unions object to plans to strip new SNCF recruits of jobs-for-life and early retirement, part of Macron's bid to reduce the SNCF's nearly 50 billion euros of debt.
The unions are gambling on public opinion turning in their favour but polls suggest an opposite trend, with just 43 percent backing the strike in an Ifop poll released Sunday.
The scale of the disruption has also eased over the course of the month as fewer workers continue with the strike.
On Monday, 35 percent of high-speed trains are set to operate -- up from just an eighth at the beginning of the month.

Thursday from the so-called ""Jungle"" migrant camp in Calais after a landmark
court ruling which could see more crossing the Channel.
Family members greeted them as they arrived by train in St Pancras station in central London, where a crowd of about 100 demonstrators stood with yellow balloons and banners reading ""refugees welcome"".
It came after judges on a British immigration tribunal on Wednesday ordered the interior ministry to allow the three teenagers and a 26-year-old, who have been living in the camp for over two months, to enter Britain while their asylum claims are considered.
Campaign group Citizen UK, which was involved in the legal action, said the four asylum seekers would arrive later on Thursday.
""We are delighted that the boys will be arriving to the safety of the UK and the care of their relatives tonight,"" said George Gabriel of Citizens UK.
""They have endured terrible journeys contending with people smugglers and shocking conditions en-route, before the chaos and squalor of the 'Jungle Camp' in Calais,"" he added.
Citizens UK members and other supporters were to gather outside St Pancras train station in central London ""to show their support for the boys and their families.""
The tribunal judges cited European Union legislation, under which those who have a relative living legally in another European country have a legal entitlement to apply to seek asylum there.
Under the rules, asylum seekers should first claim asylum in France, but the judges agreed that bureaucratic failures meant this rarely happened, and that evidence of a written claim to asylum in France was sufficient.
""This judgment highlights that there are safe, legal routes to reconnect families using the Dublin III regulations, and we hope will allow other families to be reunited,"" said Gabriel.
Ahmed, older brother of one of the boys, said he was ""relieved and thankful that tonight I will be able to hold my brother, look after him and care for him.
""War is a terrible thing for anyone to endure, but particularly for children and young people,"" he added. ""No-one should have to experience the horrors of war.""
The interior ministry must now examine claims brought by refugees who have not yet received asylum in France, paving the way for further claims if other vulnerable asylum seekers can prove they have links to Britain.
The ministry said it would ""study the full judgement in detail"" before making its next move, which may include an appeal.
""We stand by the well-established principle that those seeking protection should claim asylum in the first safe country they reach,"" it said in a statement.
""Any request to unite family members under the Dublin Regulation is carefully considered. Where someone seeking asylum elsewhere in the EU can demonstrate they have close family members legally in the UK, we will take responsibility for that claim.""
The tribunal's full judgement on the fate of the four asylum seekers is expected ""within two weeks""."

Speaking alongside Löfven after the meeting between the two at the Elysée Palace on Monday, Macron opened his statement by heaping praise on Sweden.
""Sweden has managed to develop its social model without ever betraying it, reconciling a competitive model with real demand for social justice,"" he said.
""I have always considered what some call 'the Swedish model' a true source of inspiration in many respects,"" France's President continued.
Some of the subjects the two leaders discussed in the French capital included the EU, climate change and migration.
""Sweden took on more than its share of responsibility by receiving more than 160,000 asylum seekers in 2015 alone, and its appeal for solidarity in this area in the European Union has been heard,"" Macron noted in reference to Sweden taking in a record number of asylum seekers that year.
""I would like a more pro-active policy in this area, based on serious policy reform when it comes to the reception and administration of asylum seekers in France and urgent reform of European asylum policy,"" he continued.
""We have talked about the need to better manage the migration flows to Europe. This is obviously a key issue for both our countries. The European Union urgently needs a new common asylum system built on shared responsibility between all the Member States. We also discussed ways to address all the root causes of migration, including in countries in sub-Saharan Africa where both France and Sweden have a presence,"" Löfven said in his statement.
""I want to commend President Macron on his leadership on climate change,"" the Swedish PM added, before going on to announce a new ""deep innovation partnership"" between Sweden and France.
""Some of the areas we would like to cover in this partnership are cooperation on clean energy and climate-smart transportation, and of course also an exchange of best practices to create favourable conditions for startups. So by joining forces on innovation we can create jobs and also more sustainable economic growth, and tackle by that joint challenges such as climate change more effectively,"" he concluded.

A vow was written into France’s constitution back in 1793 that promised to provide ""asylum to foreigners banished from their countries in the cause of liberty"".
Up until recent years consecutive French governments stuck to that promise and the country topped the list of destinations for asylum-seekers in Europe.
For a decade up to 1985, France welcomed 110,000 ""boat people"" escaping communist regimes in Cambodia and Vietnam. It took some 15,000 Chileans after the 1973 coup by General Augusto Pinochet.
Before that the country also welcomed hundreds of thousands of Algerians fleeing war in the 1960s.
But in recent years things have changed and France has proved one of the most reluctant of Europe's biggest nations to accept those seeking asylum, with Germany and Sweden taking in far more.
(This photo of the drowned Syrian boy has left Europe in shock. Photo: AFP)
Since 2011 only 7,000 Syrians have been granted refugee status in France, out of four million people who have fled the country, although in the UK that number is an even lower 5,000, and many of those were already in the country.
Matthieu Tardis from the NGO France Terre D’Asile told The Local previously that France was failing to meet its legal obligations to Syrian refugees, and that there was a “moral crisis” in France regarding refugees and immigration.
""Quite simply, France is not doing enough to help and accommodate Syrian refugees fleeing the conflict in their country,"" said Tardis.
Pierre Henry, Director of Terre d’Asile added: ""Welcoming refugees is in our DNA.”
""But today, we are in the middle ranks of Europeans on the issue of asylum, we are no longer a powerful voice on the subject,” Henry told AFP.
The apparent shift has come as immigration has developed into a hot political issue in France, helped by the rise of the far right National Front party, whose leader Marine Le Pen has long called for France to close its borders.
(A tent in the Calais camp of The Jungle 2. Photo: AFP)
Le Pen says France is suffering under a “migratory submersion” and even opposition leader and former president Nicolas Sarkozy recently compared the influx of migrants to ""a burst water-pipe"".
Their views appear in line with those of many of a French public who are deeply worried by the state of the country’s economy.
A new opinion poll released on Wednesday revealed 56 percent of the French public are against authorities accepting more refugees.
But some Parisians who live near makeshift migrant camps say France must do more.
“Our country's motto is 'equality, solidarity, and fraternity'. It makes sense that France should help the people that it needs,” Imen, a 25-year-old Parisien living near La Chapelle told The Local on Thursday.
“People shouldn’t forget that it was migrants from countries like Morocco and Tunisia who helped construct many of the local roads and buildings.""
(Town Hall officials clean a park that is home to around 80 migrants. Photo: The Local)
Jean-Philippe, a 34-year-old 3D animator, added: ""I believe that anyone should be able to live anywhere they want. These guys are here because of problems back in their home country.""
Nevertheless the negative opinion of the majority of the French public contrasts starkly with Germany where a recent poll revealed 69 percent were in favour of the country taking in refugees - a contrast explained by differing economic fortunes of the two states.
“The French see France as a country in economic difficulty, with a high level of unemployment, with public resources hard to come by and an immigrant population that is already high,” explained Jérôme Fourquet from Ifop polling agency.
France certainly lacks the resources to cope with newcomers, with only 30,000 hostel beds for asylum-seekers.
But as well as a lack of will and resources in France others argue that Sweden and Germany attract more migrants for different reasons other than the warmth of their welcome.
The majority of refugees are currently Syrians, Iraqis, Eritreans and Somalis -- groups that have stronger ties to Britain, Germany and Sweden. France's relative lack of English speakers is also believed to be a turn-off.
But although public opinion may be against taking in more refugees and asylum seekers, France’s Socialist government now appears ready to act.
On Thursday President François Hollande called for a crisis meeting of his top ministers on the issue of migrants. Also, Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve insisted this week that they serious about the issue.

On Saturday French Prime Minister Manuel Valls said migrants and refugees who ""are fleeing war, persecution, torture, oppression, must be welcomed,"" adding that the rule should be to treat them with ""dignity"".
""Our task is to find lasting responses founded on the values of humanity, responsibility and firmness,"" he said.
Those words will please the likes of Sudanese Abd Al Kareem, who has spent eight months living in a park in Paris, and the thousands of others that will no doubt follow him.
But even if more migrants and refugees like Al Kareem are granted asylum in France, the problems do not end there.
“No one here goes hungry. But that's not the problem,"" he told The Local.
""I've got papers, I am going to stay in France.... but what am I going to do? We need work, we need a place to live, we need to learn the language. How are we going to do that?"""

					10:53 CET+01:00				",Oliver Gee,New report blasts France over asylum failings,"A new asylum report has scolded France over its mistreatment of asylum seekers, accusing French authorities of failing to deal with the crisis in Calais and not taking their share of Syrian refugees.
The deficiencies of France's asylum policy were laid bare on Tuesday by the Council of Europe, an independent body which aims to improve cooperation between European countries. The Council's Commissioner for Human Rights Nils Muiznieks presented the report at a press conference in Paris, with France Info able to get a preview of his findings that were severely critical of France. Muiznieks took particular aim at France's slow treatment of asylum applications and its failure to resolve the crisis in the northern port of Calais, where thousands are living in makeshift camps or in forests. The report scolded France for the migrants' poor living conditions and urged measures to be taken to protect them from violence, which has regularly flared up between migrants. In early January, around 200 migrants brawled as tension mounted after the holiday season saw too few trucks crossing the channel. Muiznieks' findings were based on interviews with charities working in Calais and in the area of asylum, one of which is La Cimade. Jean-Claude Mas, secretary general of La Cimade, told The Local on Tuesday that France desperately needed to act because asylum seekers are living in ""absolute poverty"". ""The report highlights weaknesses that we have been stressing for a long time. Politicians need to have the courage to give protection to those refugees who are arriving at our gates from war-torn countries,"" he said. Mas says France is too slow at dealing with applications from asylum seekers and doesn't do enough to stop them living in squalid conditions while they wait to find out if they will be granted protection. Tuesday's report from the Council of Europe also pointed out that there were far too many unaccompanied minors living in France, estimating as many as 12,000. These children mostly do not benefit from health care or schooling, and some of them have even ended up in detention with adults. The Council also rapped France for not taking its share of Syrian refugees, urging the country to maintain its commitment of taking in at least 500 of the 2 million who have fled. Authorities in France have often been accused of not wanting to improve the conditions for asylum seekers fearing that it would simply attract more refugees.
But La Cimade's Mas says those seeking asylum would come anyway. ""They are fleeing countries like Syria and Iraq. Who would want to live there at the moment? They come to France because their countries are at war,"" he said. ""And it's not true to suggest France is overrun by migrants. If you look at Italy they accept a lot more refugees,"" he said. 'The UK needs to take on its responsibility' A reform to improve the country's system of asylum is currently going through the French parliament, which if passed should help bring down the time it takes to process applications. France's interior minister announced last year that a day centre for migrants would be opened in Calais, just weeks after he appeared to dismiss the idea. Campaigners blasted the move as a half measure. But when it comes to resolving the crisis in Calais, Mas says the UK must take on its responsibility. ""These people want to go to the UK, so it's logical that Britain deals with their demands for asylum on British soil,"" Mas said. Since 2003 the official UK border has been in France, in an attempt to stop illegal migrants reaching Britain to claim asylum. ""The UK needs to change its policy. The UK government is hiding behind public opinion but what about our European values, that's what their policy should be based on. ""These people are dying, they are fleeing war. They need protection."" It's an argument regularly put forward by French officials, including the mayor of Calais, who threatened to close Calais to British ferries last year unless London did more to help. ""I think the border should be on British territory because it's up to you to decide the migrants you want to let in or not,"" the mayor from the opposition centre-right UMP party told British lawmakers.

Pascal Brice, the head of the French Office for the Protection of Refugees (OFPRA), said France had counted 33,000 asylum requests between January and May, compared to 28,000 for the same period in 2015.
He described it as a ""controlled increase"" after a 2015 which saw a 23.6 percent jump in requests due to a burst of asylum requests at the end of the year as Europe's migration crisis hit peak levels.
France received 80,075 asylum requests in 2015 -- mostly from Sudanese and Syrian nationals. It is far from the one million arrivals in Germany which has borne the brunt of the crisis.
""There is no asylum crisis in France,"" said Brice.
Many refugees are reticent to come to France, with its notoriously complicated administrative process and lack of beds for asylum-seekers which leaves many on the street.
Paris has promised to take another 30,000 refugees as part of a European Union deal to share the burden among member states, and has scrambled to create new welcome centres and ease the administrative process.
Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve said France would accept 400 refugees per month who are currently in Greece to reach its goal.
In Paris alone, police have undertaken 23 evacuations of makeshift camps around the city and moved people into more permanent reception centres.
Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo said last week she wanted to create a refugee camp in Paris to provide proper accommodation for asylum seekers."

					11:49 CEST+02:00				",The Local,National Front posts locations of migrants in French town,"A local branch of France’s far right National Front party has prompted anger by posting the addresses of where migrants are staying in a town in south west France.
Marine Le Pen, the leader of the far right National Front, is doing her best to steer clear of controversy and negative headlines, but one of her minions obviously did not get the message.
The Hautes-Pyrénées branch of the National Front has undermined Le Pen’s attempts to make her and her party seem less extreme by posting on Facebook the addresses of where some 250 migrants are being lodged in the Catholic pilgrimage town of Lourdes.
The post was uploaded on October 17 to denounce the “outrageous camouflage by authorities” around the arrival ""of 250 illegal immigrants in Lourdes who will be housed, fed and cared for, for free or even at the taxpayer’s expense"".
It has since been taken down. Perhaps that had something to do with the racist and hateful comments below the post.
“The Pyrenees does not want Islamist invaders, we will do everything to turn them away. All these wild animals, they disgust me. They are garbage on French soil,"" read one.
The author of the post, Olivier Monteil, secretary of the department’s branch of the National Front, included a list of homes or lodgings where refugees were to stay as well as the telephone number of the local reception centre for asylum seekers in Lourdes.
While the house numbers were apparently blurred out, the street names were not.
(The Catholic pilgrimage town of Lourdes. AFP)
He also suggested the local police had been told not to intervene if there were any serious incidents involving the asylum seekers and refugees and to just a keep a record of incidents.
Local authority chiefs in the Hautes Pyrenees department rubbished that claim and said the figures quoted in the Facebook post were wrong, insisting that there would be only 108 places for refugees and asylum seekers in Lourdes.
Monteil defended his action saying: “I wanted to give the local people of Lourdes information about the migrants that are being hidden in the local population.”
“They are paying their taxes, so why should it all be hidden,” he told BFM TV. “They occupy social lodging that should be reserved for French people.
“There may be terrorists hiding among them.”
He said his beef was with the local authorities and not the migrants themselves. His post ended with the words “Marine, come quickly, really quickly” in reference to the party leader, who is hoping to defy the odds and be elected French president next year.
The charity France Terre d’Asile, which provides help to migrants and refugees in France, has lodged a formal complaint with police accusing the National Front of “an attack on someone’s private life and divulging information that endangers residents.”
The incident in Lourdes comes at a time when there is tension in the many towns and villages around France that are to host groups of migrants moved from the Jungle camp in Calais, which faces demolition.
Some lodgings have been targeted by arsonists, while one was sprayed with bullets. There have been demonstrations in many towns against the government’s decision to move migrants around France."

					14:57 CEST+02:00				",AFP,Macron hosts African and EU leaders for migration talks,"Seven African and European leaders are meeting in Paris on Monday to discuss ways to stem the flow of migrants into Europe from northern Africa.
French President Emmanuel Macron has invited his counterparts from Niger and Chad as well as the head of the Libyan unity government Fayez al-Sarraj, whose countries lie on the main transit route for migrants heading to Europe.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Spanish and Italian prime ministers Mariano Rajoy and Paulo Gentiloni, and Europe's top diplomat Federica Mogherini will join the talks.
European nations are keen to offer development aid and funding to their African partners in return for help in stemming the flow of economic migrants and asylum seekers.

Some 125,000 migrants have crossed the Mediterranean by boat this year, according to UN figures, with the vast majority arriving in Italy before travelling on to other EU members. An estimated 2,400 have died en route.
France is seeking improved border controls and patrolling of the waters around Libya - a mission complicated by the country's competing governments and state of lawlessness - as well as development aid to create jobs in Africa.
In July, Macron also proposed - without consulting his allies - the creation of so-called ""hotspots"" in Africa where asylum seekers fleeing persecution or war could lodge a request to travel to the EU.
Under such a system they may be less tempted to make the perilous trip across the Mediterranean with the help of people traffickers, who frequently overload flimsy boats and often mistreat the migrants.

""Above all, we have to save lives, we have to avoid situations where migrants and refugees put their lives in danger to reach protection,"" said Ralf Gruenert, France's representative of the UN refugee agency UNHCR.
""This working meeting will try to explore... how to ensure that refugees and asylum seekers can access protection mechanisms,"" he told AFP.
Sharp fall in crossings
The meeting might also provide insight into why arrivals have plummeted in recent weeks from Libya, the main route into Europe since a separate pathway from Turkey into Greece was shut down in 2016.
The numbers arriving in Italy have fallen by around 50 percent in July and August compared with last year.
Possible reasons include improved action by the Libyan coastguard, tougher border controls in transit countries inland, as well as Libyan militias joining efforts to stop boats leaving.
The president of Niger, Mahamadou Issoufou, will tell his European counterparts that the number of migrants passing through the transit town of Agadez in his country has fallen by 80 percent thanks to government efforts, a source in his team told AFP.
Libya has also sought to restrict the work of NGOs operating rescue boats in the Mediterranean that pick up migrants stranded on inflatable dinghies or other unseaworthy crafts.
Italy has also sought to impose a code of conduct on the NGOs, which face accusations from some critics that their operations have encouraged migrants to attempt the crossing with the knowledge that they will be picked up in an emergency.
The code has been signed by five of seven NGOs with rescue ships - only the French organisation Doctors Without Borders and Germany's Sea-Watch have refused as a matter of principle, saying they wait to maintain their independence.
The code is set to be approved by all the countries attending Monday's meeting, according to the Italian news agency ANSA.
After the talks about immigration during the day, the European leaders are set to discuss reforming the EU and joint efforts to prevent terror attacks.

					13:50 CEST+02:00				",Joshua Melvin,French test plan for long-term visa applicants,"New legislation unveiled on Wednesday aims to shrink the bureaucratic hurdles foreigners who want to stay in France face and provide a glimmer of hope for asylum seekers languishing in limbo. But anyone wanting to get a ten-year visa would need to be able to read French.
French authorities are aiming to make a dent in the mountain of paperwork and delays generated by some of the antiquated sections of its immigration system with a new ground-breaking bill. The proposals are also seeking to address a growing humanitarian crisis among its most vulnerable recent arrivals. The French government hopes the legislation, proposed at Wednesday's cabinet meeting, will mean a kinder welcome for foreigners and real effort to help them integrate into society. At the same time France wants to catch up on its delay in attracting the best and the brightest minds from abroad. 'France must remain a land of immigration' Current Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve told French paper Liberation that France ""must remain a land of immigration and a land of asylum,"" adding that ""countries closed to the outside world are condemned to decline."" The law, which was penned by Prime Minister Manuel Valls in his previous job as interior minister, is an effort to approach the controversial topic in a calm and pragmatic way, the government claims. Here’s four key points about the new legislation: Multi-year visas: Many foreigners in France are here on a “carte de sejour” (residency permit) that is good for a year. For scores of thousands of people this means making an annual appointment at the local Prefecture, waiting in line and then usually going back a second time because the clerk wanted additional documents in order to stay legal. But this new laws proposes making the permits valid for up to four years, meaning a huge reduction in paperwork for foreigners and the government alike. As it stands 99 percent of the renewal applications are granted. However, as the proposed law is written, one would have to be taking language and civics classes to get the extended visa. And getting the coveted ten-year residence permit after that would be conditioned on being able to read and understand simple texts in French. One visa for skilled workers: The government is calling it a “Talent passport” and it would be a new visa category that allows people with particular talents (artists, scientists, athletes and business leaders) the possibility to more easily live and work in France. It would replace the tangled mess of various visas issued depending on one’s circumstances and reasons for being here. The idea of these four-year visas is to attract talent to France and make it easier for those people to work. “We’re far behind the rest of Europe, our neighbours attract far more of these types of candidates than we do,” an unnamed government source told French daily Le Croix. SEE ALSO: Calais migrants: 'France needs a new policy'
Cut asylum delays: Amid wars in Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan, France has seen the annual number asylum seekers nearly double in six years. In 2013 the number stood at 65,894 and though only 11,415 cases were granted asylum, many had to wait up to two years for a decision from French authorities. The new law proposes cutting the wait to nine months by 2017 via a programme of bolstering resources and manpower. Cases suffering from excessive delays could also be fast-tracked, as could appeals lodged when asylum seekers are rejected. Protecting asylum seekers: During the two years many asylum seekers spend awaiting a decision from French authorities some are lucky enough to get into government housing. But half of them end up homeless, living in squats or improvised housing they’ve found themselves. Under the new proposed legislation, the government would provide housing for all asylum seekers, but it would be spread out across the country. Failure to live in the assigned housing would mean the government could cut off the welfare payments to asylum seekers. Each case would also be assigned a lawyer who would be paid for by the government. 'Policy of repression' The “integration” aspect of the legislation has already raised the hackles of immigration rights activists. “[The legislation] is characteristic of the obsession with the struggle against irregular immigration and the order to “integrate” but it doesn’t demonstrate any substantial progress in the area of fundamental rights,” pro-immigrant group GISTI told AFP. Pro-immigrant group GISTI (Information and Support Group for Immigrants) called the residency permit reforms a half-measure that fails to tackle the real issue, which is providing some guarantees to immigrants about their future in France. The group called on the leaders to grant ten-year permits to long-term residents. “The granting of a ""multi-year visa"" which could, additionally, be taken away at any time by the Prefecture, doesn’t resolve any of these problems,” the group wrote in a statement. “We reject that in 2014 the people who have built their lives in France are left unstable by doubtful residency rights.” Another immigrant group La CIMADE said the government has clearly chosen to stay in “continuity with the policy of repression”. There was no immediate word from France’s far-right, anti-immigrant National Front, but it is undoubtedly legislation they will weigh in on soon. It's unclear when the bills could be voted on, but the government was hoping to get both before parliament by the first quarter of 2015."

It's the latest confrontation in the long-running migrant crisis that involves France and Britain.
Police in France's northern port of Calais fired tear gas on Wednesday on migrants trying to force their way onto trucks in a desperate bid to get to Britain after they threw stones at security forces. The incident is the latest in a series of confrontations between asylum seekers and authorities in the port, which trucks go through to board ferries bound for Britain. The port is struggling to stem a tide of illegal migrants trying to cross the Channel to Britain, which they see as having a favourable asylum policy, despite a slew of recent measures including tighter security and policing. Authorities in the Pas-de-Calais department where the port is located said some 250 migrants grouped together just outside the port on Wednesday morning. One of them fell while trying to get onto a truck and hurt his head. When an ambulance arrived to take him to hospital, a big group of migrants tried to stop the vehicle from driving him away, they added.
They then tried to prise open wire fencing to get into the area where trucks are checked before they board ferries and threw stones at police, who responded with tear gas, authorities said. By early afternoon, the situation had returned to normal. The problem in Calais is not new, and illegal camps of migrants have sprung up in the area since French authorities closed down the infamous Sangatte immigrant detention centre in 2002. But the crisis has spiralled, prompting the city's mayor Natacha Bouchart to threaten to shut down the port entirely in protest at London's perceived lack of action or help over the problem. Britain has since offered to send over the strong security fences used at a recent NATO meeting in Wales. French authorities have already arrested around 7,500 illegal immigrants trying to cross the Channel this year, and security has been ramped up."

					07:02 CEST+02:00				",AFP,Hollande vows to 'completely dismantle' Calais Jungle,"President Francois Hollande, under pressure from the right wing, on Saturday stepped up his pledge to combat
illegal migration, vowing to dismantle a squalid settlement near Calais and prevent similar camps from becoming established in France.
""There will be no camps in France,"" said Hollande, two days ahead of a maiden visit to the notorious ""Jungle"" settlement near Calais, where between 7,000 and 10,000 desperate migrants live.
The Socialist leader spelt out promises to ""completely dismantle"" the Jungle and set up ""reception and orientation centres around the country"" to accommodate asylum-seekers.
Hollande's government has vowed to scrap the Jungle ""before winter"" and a flurry of preparations underway there suggest the operation may begin shortly. Migration has been a low-key issue under Hollande's four-year-old presidency.
But he has been forced to take a visible stance on the issue, under pressure from his conservative predecessor Nicolas Sarkozy -- who is hoping to make a comeback as president -- and far-right leader Marine Le Pen.
Each are promoting platforms of security, patriotism and national interest in early campaigning for next year's elections.
""We will provide a humane, dignified welcome to people who will file for the right of asylum,"" Hollande said. Those whose request has been rejected ""will be escorted out of the country. Those are the rules and they are fully aware of them.""
He noted that France would accept 80,000 asylum-seekers this year, a fraction of that accepted by Germany.
Separately, the top administrative office, or prefecture, for the Pas-de-Calais region said a Sudanese migrant aged about 30 died late Saturday when he was hit by a freight train near the port of Calais.
He was the 13th migrant to die in the Calais area since the start of the year, according to an AFP poll. Most of the deaths have been people who have tried to board trucks heading to Britain via the Channel Tunnel or ferry.
Meanwhile, Sarkozy returned Saturday to remarks on national identity that sparked a fierce row earlier this week.
On Tuesday, Sarkozy said that once immigrants are granted citizenship ""they should live like the French.""
""Once you become French, your ancestors are the Gauls. 'I love France, I learned the history of France, I see myself as French',"" is what you must say,"" he said.
The remarks sparked a storm, prompting historians to note that France has been a land of immigration for centuries and the line ""our ancestors the Gauls"" was an opening to history textbooks that today is widely derided.
On Saturday, Sarkozy extended his ""Gauls"" reference and provided what he contended was a patriotic benchmark for Muslim immigrants to France.
""Our ancestors were the Gauls, they were also the kings of France, the Enlightenment, Napoleon, the great Republicans,"" he told a rally in the southwestern town of Perpignan.
""Our ancestors were (also) the colonial troops who died at the Chemin des Dames in World War I, the Muslim riflemen who died at Monte Cassino,"" he said referring to a battle against German troops in Italy in 1944.
Sarkozy paid special tribute to the Harkis -- Muslim auxiliaries who fought alongside French troops in Algeria's bloody 1954-1962 war of independence.
""In our national story... a special place is reserved for French Muslims who died for our freedom and flag,"" he said."

French police are regularly using pepper spray against migrants in Calais, Human Rights Watch (HRW) said Wednesday, an accusation denied by authorities.
In a report entitled ""Like living in hell"" the use of pepper spray against migrants massed in the northern coastal city is described as ""routine"".
""Police use of pepper spray in Calais is so common that many asylum seekers and migrants had difficulty recalling precisely how many times they had been sprayed,"" the report said.
Of 61 migrants questioned by the prominent international human rights group between the end of June and the beginning of July, 55 said they had been sprayed during the two weeks before the interview, and some said they had been sprayed every day, the author of the report, Michael Garcia Bochenek, told AFP.

""The 55 were sprayed while they slept,"" he said, adding that he had talked to groups of varying nationalities in different locations, but the similarity of their stories ""shows there is a serious problem"".
""These are practices that have become routine, without there being any consequences, and that is when they become serious abuses,"" HRW France Director Benedicte Jeannerod told AFP.
For more than a decade France's northern coast has been a magnet for refugees and migrants trying to reach Britain.
In October last year Calais' notorious makeshift camp, nicknamed ""the Jungle"", where thousands lived in the hope of climbing aboard trucks or trains to get across the Channel, was dismantled.
But HRW said hundreds of asylum seekers and migrants, mostly Eritreans, Ethiopians and Afghans, are still living on the streets and in wooded areas in
and around the port city.
""Every day, the police chase us. They use spray. They kick us. This is our life every day,"" said Waysira L, a 16-year-old boy from the Oromo community, an ethnic group in east Africa.
Fabien Sudry, prefect for the Pas-de-Calais region, ""categorically denied the false and defamatory allegations"" in the report, which he said ""have no evidential basis"".

France will open its doors to 24,000 refugees over the next two years, the country's president announced on Monday.
That’s the number the European Commission has asked France to accept under an urgent new plan aimed at easing the growing refugee crisis around Europe.
Speaking at a press conference on Monday, President François Hollande said that France is ""willing to play its part"".
Hollande said it was a ""fundamental principle"" of France to accept asylum seekers.
""It's the duty for France. The right of asylum is an integral part of our body and soul. Our history demands this responsibility,"" he added.
""The French are a great people forged over generations of people who sometimes have come from far away,"" said Hollande.
The new plan put together by European Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker will be presented in Strasbourg on Wednesday and is aimed at seeing 120,000 refugees relocated around Europe over the next two years.
Under Juncker's plane Germany will be asked to take in 31, 000 refugees over the same period and Spain will be asked to take in 15,000 (see below).
""We cannot leave Germany alone to take on this responsibility,"" Hollande said.
The president stressed that Europe's open borders scheme, known as Schengen, would collapse without united EU efforts to relocate migrants and refugees.
'Schengen will end unless united EU effort'
""If there is not a united policy, this mechanism will not work, it will collapse, and it will... undoubtedly be the end of Schengen, the return of national borders,"" he told the press conference in Paris.
Hollande's willingness to accept 24,000 refugees will put more pressure on the UK's David Cameron, who is set to give more details later on Monday on how many extra Syrian refugees Britain will accept.

""We will propose to host an international conference on refugees in Paris.""
France's Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve will host a meeting of mayors from across France on Saturday to discuss the logistics and possibilities of relocating refugees.

The French presidency announced the two European powerhouses would send joint proposals to Brussels ""for organising the welcome of refugees and their fair distribution in Europe"" and for ""reinforcing the European asylum system.""
With the large number of refugees and migrants flooding into Europe and moving through the continent, it warned that ""dramas are being followed by tragedies.""
""Thousands of victims have died since the start of the year. The European Union must act in a decisive manner in line with its values,"" the French presidency said."

The near-50 percent rise since 2001 is due in part to a surge in foreign asylum-seekers, the study said.
Some 141,500 people were without a fixed abode in France last year, according to Tuesday’s report by national statistics agency Insee. More than 30,000 of those were children. This number represents a close to 50-percent increase in homelessness in Europe’s second-largest economy since 2001. The study found that two out of five homeless people were women, but that women in general had better temporary accommodation than men. More than half of those with no fixed abode were foreigners, the study found – a 15-percent increase since 2001 – and 25,000 were being housed in Cada, France’s accommodation centre for asylum-seekers.
Perhaps of greatest concern is that almost 50 percent of homeless people in France would prefer not to stay overnight in group accommodation, because of fears over hygiene and personal safety. French Housing Minister Cécile Duflot caused controversy last December by asking Catholic church authorities to hand over empty properties to house homeless families during the winter. In 2011, The Local reported how homeless families in the Paris region had become so desperate in searching for shelter than some had even begun showing up at hospital emergency rooms."

The recommendations, which are non-binding, were laid out in a report by the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child (CRC) after a review of the state of child rights in France.
In the report, the committee urges France ""to explicitly prohibit corporal punishment in all settings, including in the family, in schools, day cares and in alternative care"".
""No violence against children is justifiable"" it said, recalling that corporal punishment ""is a form of violence, invariably degrading and preventable"".
French law bans violence against children but does allow parents the ""right to discipline"" them. It also prohibits corporal punishment in schools or disciplinary establishments for children.
The UN committee also said it was ""concerned by cases of ill-treatment of children with disabilities in institutions"".
Specifically, it demanded that France ban ""packing"", a technique reportedly used on children with autistic spectrum disorders, in which a child is wrapped in cold, wet sheets, saying the practice amounted to ""ill treatment"".
Migrant children and asylum seekers were also an issue of concern, with committee member Hynd Ayoubi Idrissi particularly raising the plight of those living at the sprawling ""Jungle"" migrant camp in the northern port city of Calais, where thousands of people are living in squalor in the hope of reaching Britain.
At a press conference, she said that although France had taken steps to stop unaccompanied minors from being held in administrative detention, there was ""a gap"" between the decision taken by the interior ministry and what was happening on the ground.
""More and more children are being placed in administrative waiting zones, in hotels which don't comply with the minimum child protection standards,"" she said, noting that not all of them have access to a guardian while going through the asylum application procedure.
Without a residency permit, these children also ""had difficulty in exercising their right to access health care services,"" the report said.
The committee also raised the plight of children from traveller families, expressing concern ""at the persistence of racial discrimination and stigmatization against Roma children"".
""It is also concerned by cases of forced evictions of Roma children and their families, without alternative relocation and without notice.""
The report was released a day after 400 Roma were evacuated from a disused railway line in northern Paris where they had set up camp in June, with the Council of Europe expressing concern over what it called France's ""policy of mass expulsions""."

France and Germany agreed Thursday to accept some 21,000 asylum-seekers and refugees as part of EU efforts to deal with the flood of migrants seeking refuge from conflicts across North Africa and the Middle East.
EU leaders agreed last month to take in 60,000 people over the next two years but on a voluntary basis after many member states objected strongly to proposed mandatory quotas.
The figures comprise 40,000 Syrian and Eritrean asylum-seekers already in Europe who will be redistributed across the 28-nation bloc plus another 20,000 Syrians in camps overseas.
French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve and his German counterpart Thomas De Maiziere announced that France would take 9,100 and Germany 12,100.
The two countries had a duty ""to offer a dignified welcome to those with refugee status,"" Cazeneuve said.
At the same time, the countries had set conditions to ensure ""that what we are doing out of solidarity (with other EU states) will be sustainable.""
He said it was essential that reception points for migrants be beefed up to ensure that genuine asylum seekers are clearly separated out from economic migrants who will be returned home.
Disagreements remain among EU nations over how to share responsibility for the refugees and asylum seekers. Spain and Austria did not want to announce on Thursday what their contribution to the effort would be, European sources said.
De Maiziere told reporters in Luxembourg ""there are some countries which have problems with the concept and are afraid it will only encourage"" more migrants.
Italy, Greece and Malta have borne the brunt of the migrant influx and Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi has repeatedly urged his European Union peers to do much more to ease the burden.
At the late June leaders summit, Renzi was said to have lashed out at his colleagues after mandatory quotas were rejected, reportedly saying that ""If that is your idea of Europe, you can keep it!""
EU president Donald Tusk, a former Polish premier whose country opposed the mandatory quota system, said after the summit that member states would submit their voluntary offers by mid-July.
More than 140,000 migrants have crossed the Mediterranean so far this year, most of them landing in Italy, Greece and Malta.

France's centrist president, who campaigned for open borders in last year's election, has since drawn criticism for his government's uncompromising attitude towards migrants sleeping rough on the streets of Calais and Paris.
France received a record 100,000 asylum claims last year, making it one of Europe's top destinations.
Macron has promised to speed up waiting times for asylum applications while also stepping up expulsions of those who remain in France after being turned down for refugee status -- an approach he touts as mixing ""efficiency"" and ""humanity"".
NGOs, trade unions and left wing parties take a different view, often accusing him of wielding an iron fist in a velvet glove.
The police in Calais routinely break up the camps of migrants who descend on the region to try and stow away on trucks crossing the Channel to Britain, a favourite destination for Afghans and east Africans.
Hundreds of migrants are still massed in the area, over a year after the former Socialist government bulldozed the Jungle, a squalid makeshift camp in Calais, and moved its more than 7,000 occupants to shelters nationwide.
In December, Interior Minister Gerard Collomb further raised the hackles of migrant support groups by ordering ID checks in emergency shelters, sparking fears of a witch hunt against failed asylum seekers.
On Thursday, Macron will travel to southern England for a French-British summit where he will demand that Britain, which in 2003 effectively pushed back its border to France, do more to help ease the migrant burden.

In an interview with Le Parisien published Sunday, Collomb said he would push for changes to the 2003 Le Touquet accords allowing British border controls on French territory.
Collomb said France would specifically demand ""concrete measures"" from Prime Minister Theresa May's government on taking in more unaccompanied minors seeking to join relatives or friends across the water, and on contributing more to the costs of policing the border.

Mariam Guerey, of Secours Catholique, said the Syrians were ""shocked"" by the British refusal to take them in. ""They had another image of England. For them, this is the dream,"" she said. The mayor of Calais, a Channel port from where many ships and ferries leave for Britain, said the protest highlighted the need for a concerted European strategy. ""It's unacceptable that it is in France and at Calais that one has to control immigration."" The protest, which has seen 20 people go on hunger strike, prompted French authorities to offer to legalise the refugees' status. Some 50 police from an anti-riot squad moved in early Friday to try and clear the protestors from a footbridge but backed off when two of them threatened suicide. Pas-de-Calais prefect Robin then went to the site and offered the Syrians, currently illegal immigrants, the right to asylum. ""Today, the Syrians present here are caught in a stalemate. What we can do is to offer them a status on French territory... in other words to make a request for asylum,"" he told reporters. He said every asylum demand had a ""95 percent chance of success"". French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius has pledged to fast-track the applications of Syrians fleeing their war-torn country.
But some refugees said they would still try to get into the UK. One of the group, Zakarya, 45, said: ""I want to go as soon as possible to England."" The protesting refugees, most of whom arrived in Calais a month ago, have voiced disappointment at the way they have been treated in France. They affixed cardboard signs reading ""Take us to the UK"", and ""We want to talk to David Cameron"". ""We live outside like dogs, hunted down by the police, we see we are not welcome, how can we seek asylum here?"" said 19-year-old Tarik. Ali, a 38-year-old, said although French President Francois Hollande had taken a strong stand against the regime of President Bashar al-Assad for using chemical weapons, the French were not welcoming at all. ""Why does the president say one thing and the police another?"" Ali said, adding that he had spent $13,000 (€9,500) to come to a country where the ""president said 'we must help Syrians'"". ""Here even animals are better treated than us,"" he said."

					08:47 CEST+02:00				",AFP,EU ministers to hold migrant talks: France,"Europe's interior and foreign ministers will meet in mid-October to discuss how to respond to the huge influx of migrants and refugees arriving at EU borders, French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve said on Thursday.
The meeting, to be followed by further talks in Berlin, will pave the way for broader discussions at an EU summit in Malta in November which will also be attended by African leaders, Cazeneuve said after talks with his German counterpart Thomas de Maiziere in the German capital.
De Maiziere said it was ""unacceptable that European institutions continue to work at their current slow pace"" in finding a joint solution to the crisis, adding that ""too little"" was being done to implement decisions that have already been taken.
EU border agency Frontex reported on Tuesday that a record 107,000 migrants were massed at the bloc's borders last month, as the continent faces its biggest migration crisis since World War II.
De Maiziere said he hoped new centres set up to determine whether new arrivals are refugees fleeing war, or economic migrants simply looking for work, would be operational by the end of the year in Greece and Italy, the countries bearing the brunt of the crisis.
Cazeneuve, meanwhile, called for a ""harmonisation"" of asylum laws in Europe and the creation of ""a list of safe countries of origin at the European level"" to make it easier to send home asylum-seekers whose countries are considered at peace.
He also urged a ""deepening of cooperation among police and intelligence services"" along the lines of a deal agreed Thursday between France and Britain to combat people smuggling at Calais.
European leaders are expected to use the Malta summit to encourage their African counterparts to do more to stem the flow of migrants heading across the Mediterranean in rickety boats in search of a better life in Europe.
They will also seek assurances that African countries will actually implement agreements signed with European countries to take back migrants who have been denied leave to remain in the EU.
De Maiziere expressed hope that the European Commission will be able to move forward with agreements allowing rejected asylum-seekers to return to their home countries ""without fear of persecution"".
Cazeneuve added that this will require ""discussions with the countries of origin"".
The two foreign ministers also discussed Ukraine, Cazeneuve said, adding that they prepared new initiatives on the conflict that will be presented to European institutions.
The leaders of France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine held telephone discussions Thursday, with all sides calling for the full implementation of a ceasefire deal, according to the French presidency."

					16:09 CEST+02:00				",The Local,Amnesty wants Hollande to up human rights effort,"Rights watchdog Amnesty International has filed its end of year report on French President François Hollande's record on tackling human rights issues. Its conclusion was: Could do better.
Amnesty has called on French President Francois Hollande to fulfill the commitments he made during his electoral race to shore up human rights. However, the rights watchdog nonetheless noted a change in governmental attitude toward human rights since the days of Nicolas Sarkozy. In April 2012, the human rights organization sent a letter to all the presidential candidates vying for entry to the Élysée Palace, asking that they consider ten points of improvement to help safeguard human rights in the country. ""Well, firstly, Mr Sarkozy did not reply,"" Amnesty International France spokesman Patrick Delouvin told The Local. ""Mr Hollande sent us a long letter in response. We have some expectations on the new government."" In a report entitled ""Francois Hollande - One year later,"" released this week, the human rights organization went through its list of recommendations - ranging from asylum seekers to Roma, and looking at civil liberties. It said that while Amnesty welcomed the legalization of same-sex marriage in France, there was nonetheless the need for further efforts to tackle homophobia. The treatment of asylum seekers and of the Roma people were also mentioned among the areas where France needed to take action to ensure human rights were protected. The organization had addressed its concerns with the French prime minister in November, after several high-profile evictions of Roma took place over the summer. Amnesty noted that dismantling their settlements endangered the rights of those expelled to get access to housing, health and education. In the report, Amnesty said that the then presidential candidate's response at the time was to try to find ""alternative solutions"". ""We must find solutions to combine the respect of private property, the safety of those affected(...) with the task of integrating the (Roma) population,"" Hollande is quoted as saying in the letter he sent Amnesty last year. Delouvin said the situation for the Roma was probably the toughest point on the list of suggested improvements, and welcomed the inter-ministerial push for action, which tied the interior minister and six other ministers to a steering document on the issue. The government had also appointed a special rapporteur. ""Unfortunately, the situation for Romas is sill very difficult we hope that in the future the (rapporteur's) work will permit some improvements locally,"" Delouvin said. Amnesty also said the procedures for how to welcome and house asylum seekers, as well as ensuring their access to the asylum application system, needed review. As did laws concerning foreign nationals in France. ""The recommendations we made in 2012 came from difficulties in laws in France because of the presence of Mr Sarkozy,"" said Delouvin. ""We had worse laws on asylum and foreigners in general, now we have recently had consultations with officials in the home office and we are awaiting new laws."" There was also praise for concrete action from the French president. The report authors credited Hollande with making sure France signed up to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, as well as to the Arms Trade Treaty. Feedback on Hollande's push to speak up for human rights on the global scene was more tempered, however. Amnesty said that while a speech at the Francophone Summit had highlighted such issues with the Congolese delegates, the French president had not followed through in certain key bilateral talks, including with Russia, Morocco and China ""Amnesty finds it regrettable that the president showed reluctance to address human rights on official visits,"" the report read.

The Kronen Zeitung newspaper reported that the pair are French citizens posing as refugees, who travelled with some of the Paris attackers through Greece and the Balkans in early October, using fake Syrian passports.
They were arrested over the weekend after police received a tip-off from a foreign intelligence service. There is some speculation that they were waiting in Salzburg for orders to carry out further terrorist attacks.
A spokesman for the state prosecutor, Robert Holzleitner, said he cannot confirm if they planned to carry out terror attacks and declined to comment on their nationalities, saying that they had ""come from the Middle East"".
He did confirm that ""indications of a possible link to the Paris attacks are currently being investigated"".
In a related story, two asylum seekers suspected of being members of the Isis terror group were taken into custody in Salzburg just a few weeks ago.
The pair, aged 20 and 21, are reported to have boasted to other refugees and volunteers that they had fought with Isis in Syria.
Prosecutors have said that so far there is no evidence that they planned to carry out attacks in Europe or that they had any links to previous attacks.
Salah Abdeslam, a 26-year-old French citizen who is thought to have played a key logistical role in the Paris attacks, is still on the run and subject to an international arrest warrant.
Abdeslam was also registered as having been in Austria on September 9th after being stopped in a routine traffic check in a car with Belgian number plates with two other men, Austrian authorities said on November 17th. Abdeslam told police he was ""on holiday"" in Austria.
He also travelled to Hungary before the attacks where he ""recruited a team"" from unregistered migrants passing through, Hungarian officials said on December 3rd."

Earlier this month Senator Jean Arthuis, who is president of the council of the Mayenne department in the west of France decided enough was enough. Arthuis, from the centre right UDI party decided the authorities could no longer deal with the number of foreign children found without a parent or guardian in his region. The former minister under ex-French president Jacques Chirac signed a decree to “put an end to accepting any new unaccompanied foreign child” in the territory of Mayenne. Assylum seekers rights group France Terre d’Asile (France Earth Asylum) has slammed the politician for acting “outside the law”. “After the travelling community, the Roma, now it’s the turn of abandoned foreign children,” an angry Pierre Henry, head of the organisation told The Local. ""There's been some scandalous things said this summer about the Roma, the travellers and now its the turn of the foreign children. “This decree against unaccompanied foreign children is indisputably discriminatory. It is illegal and needs to be annulled,” Henry said, adding that it was a shameful first for France. ""It's outrageous. The law obliges them to look after the needs of children who in danger no matter what nationality they are. ""There is no justification for this,"" Henry said. “Unaccompanied foreign children” as they are referred to in official language refers to children who for one reason or another end up without any parent or legal guardian to look after them. They can end up alone in France for a number of reasons, whether it’s because they were abandoned by their parents or family or they may have been victims of trafficking.
Most children found in France without any parents or guardian are from India, Pakistan or Mali. In all there are around 6,000 in France, with a third of those in the Paris region. For his part Arthuis says he took the decision because the two care centres for abandoned children were at saturation point. “Today I no longer have the means to accommodate them,"" he said. ""With this decree I sounded the alarm. I want to warn the government . The reception of foreign children is their responsibility not the responsibility of the regional authorities,” he added. But Terre d’Asile’s Henry slammed Arthuis for putting politics before children."

					10:21 CEST+02:00				",AFP/The Local,"Police clear out '2,500' migrants from Paris camp","Police in Paris carried out their 26th eviction order on a migrant camp on Friday with 2,500 mainly young men from Syria and east Africa evacuated.
The eviction took place on Friday morning near Juares Metro station on the border of the 10th and 19th arrondissements where the camp had built up underneath the overground train line.
Scores of riot police were drafted in to help with the operation that resulted in tense scenes due to the sheer number of migrants and refugees involved.
While official estimates on the number of migrants in the camp were around 1,500, Le Parisien newspaper suggested the was as high as 2,500 after hundreds more moved into the area on Thursday in order to be part of the eviction.
Tear gas was used as the crowd of migrants pushed forward to get on some of the buses that had been laid on.
The camp had built up over recent months after police had cleared out several others in the neighbouring area and more refugees and migrants arrived in the French capital.
In recent days tensions have flared as the summer heat only worsened the squalid conditions underneath the Metro tracks.
Many migrants and refugees pass through Paris on their way to northern France from where they hope to make it to the UK, while others head for northern Europe from the nearby Gare du Nord train station.
The migrants were put on buses and taken out of the area with around 1,500 short term accommodation places being made available for them around the country.
However many are expected to end of up living on the streets of the capital once again, probably in another squalid makeshift camp that will no doubt emerge.
The head of the French Immigration and Integration Office, Didier Leschi, said some were passing through France and were planning to seek asylum in other European countries.
Others, however, had already been granted asylum in France ""but cannot find work and don't know where to live.""
Migrant support groups complain of a dire shortage of accommodation for asylum-seekers, saying the 20,000 spaces created in the past two years are insufficient in the face of a constant stream of new arrivals.
Over the past year, squalid camps have repeatedly cropped up in northern Paris -- with the police intervening each time to dismantle them.
In May, the city's mayor Anne Hidalgo announced plans to create a refugee camp with proper facilities, scheduled to be up and running in September.
The other main destination in France for refugees and migrants is the northern port of Calais, where thousands of people are camped out in the hope of stowing away in a truck bound for Britain.
Pierre Henry, head of France Terre d'Asile, a charity that helps refugees and asylum seekers, called for other French cities to step up to the plate.
""We need (accommodation) centres in all the regional capitals, to receive the refugees and help them get their bearings, so that people are not drawn just to Paris and Calais,"" he said."

“Asylum seekers and migrants living in the poverty in the port city of Calais are victims of harassment and abuse by French police,” Human Rights Watch claim. The report is based on the accounts of 44 migrants who say they have witnessed the abuse. However it has been criticised by France’s Interior Ministry, who have suggested it is biased. “Nineteen people, including two children said that police had abused them at least once, including through beatings,"" the report says. “Eight were left with broken limbs or other visible injuries, which according to them were caused by police in Calais and the surrounding area."" “Twenty-one, including two children, have said that the police sprayed them with tear gas,” Human Rights Watch say.

HRW have called on the French government to launch an immediate investigation and also provide police with guidance over the use of force and when it is “unjustified and disproportionate”. However France’s Minister of Interior Bernard Cazeneuve hit back on Tuesday and slammed the NGO for “not trying to verify the allegations of police violence to which it refers”. “The seriousness of the charges against the public security forces contained in this document should have led the association to approach those in charge of the police with specific facts,” the minister said.

Officials' tough stance on the migrants, most of whom hope to get to the UK, has drawn criticism from humanitarian groups.
Citing poor sanitation and concerns over the prolonged duration of the main migrant camp in Calais, riot police moved in early Wednesday with tear gas and evicted some 320 people who had set up home there in between attempts to smuggle themselves into the United Kingdom. Around 250 migrants were taking refuge inside a squat at the Channel port, that doubles as a feeding centre run by local charities, when officers encircled the building around 6:30am. Three hours later police had cleared out that building as well as the 70 some migrants living in three other squats, AFP reported. Local Prefect Denis Robin said each of the migrants will each get an administrative hearing on their situation with decisions made on a ""case by case basis."" Some migrants were to be taken to detention centres, while other would be placed in shelter for asylum seekers. A witness described the chaotic scenes that unraveled as officers moved in. ""I was inside when the cops arrived, they blocked all the exits and used tear gas to keep people from escaping,"" a charity volunteer Celine, who provided only her first name, told BFMTV. ""People were sleeping, they didn't have the time to get out."" The operation was authorized by a court in nearby Lille after Calais authorities argued the camp, which had been operating since May, didn't have adequate sanitation facilities and was on its way to becoming a long-term shelter, which the city opposed. After the raid riot police used 15 buses to carry away the migrants, who now face the prospect of being deported to their home countries. Local humanitarian groups said many of the migrants are from war-torn countries like Afghanistan, Sudan, Syria and Iraq. ""Twenty or so women and roughly 10 children were sleeping at the site in last couple days,"" Christian Salomé from charity group Auberge des Migrants told reporters. ""The migrants come from countries that are at war. It's very bad that all this happened out of the public eye.""
This confrontation comes just over a month after riot police cleared 650 migrants out of makeshift camps that had sprung up around Calais. While local authorities noted some of the camps, which were hit by a scabies outbreak, presented a risk to its inhabitants, humanitarian groups argued the raids deprived the migrants of their only shelter. The war in Syria and political instability in other nations like Egypt have sent a rush of people to Calais, where the migrants wait for a chance to smuggle themselves to Britain. Three thousand arrived in the first five months of 2014, compared with 300 during the same period the prior year. The migrants are drawn across the English Channel by a hopes of a more generous refugee programme and a chance to reunite with family members already living there. Humanitarian groups said the cycle of allowing camps to grow and then violent eviction by police must end, because it's clear the migrants aren't going to stop coming. “We have to take into account the reality of the situation and this zone is a part of a circuit for people seeking asylum in Britain. It’s not going to stop tomorrow,” said Jean-Claude Mas, secretary general of immigration support group La Cimade told The Local previously. “Instead of discouraging people who have nothing to lose, and who are willing to do anything to make the crossing at Calais, why not get organized?”"

The former president railed against the European Commission's plan to divide up the asylum seekers arriving in their thousands in the waters off Italy, Greece and Malta aboard rickety, overcrowded boats from North Africa and the Middle East.

					18:01 CEST+02:00				",The Local/AFP,Uproar over plan to alter French citizenship laws,"France’s opposition party kicked off a storm this week by proposing a change in the law, aimed at making France less attractive to immigrants. The UMP wants to revoke the automatic right to French citizenship for children born in France to foreign parents.
The UMP’s proposal to redefine France’s immigration laws was put forward by party leader Jean-François Copé and comes days after France was rocked by the scandal of 15-year-old Roma girl Leonarda Dibrani, who was deported to Kosovo during a school trip. Copé said the bill, which will be presented to the French Parliament in 2014, is vital to stop France being so attractive to migrants. “Is it normal for a child born in France to parents who are in France illegally can automatically become French? The answer is no,” Copé told France Inter radio. The current rules around naturalization grant children born on France to foreign parents the right under law to gain French nationality once they turn 18, as long as they have lived in the country for at least five years from the age of 11. In a move seen as a response to a surge in support for the far-right National Front (FN), Copé also backed qualifying periods of up to 10 years for some welfare benefits and the abolition of State Medical Aid (AME), a safety net that ensures doctors get paid for treating patients - notably asylum seekers - who are outside the country's social security system. ""France is being hit from one side by a rise in serious tensions between (ethnic minority) communities and from the other by the extreme right,"" Copé told AFP. ""Only the UMP can deliver a solution and we have to rewrite immigration policy completely. ""We are the most attractive country in Europe for migrants and that has to stop."" SEE ALSO : Ten reasons why you should become French ""This is not the France we dream of"" The principle of automatic citizenship for everyone born in France – known as ""le droit du sol"" (the right of the soil) - is a cherished one for many in France, who see it as one of the cornerstones of the republic and the country's long history of providing a haven for refugees from all over the world. Its abolition in 1993 by a centre-right administration was hugely controversial and the legislation was reversed five years later, so any child born in France to foreign parents automatically becomes a French citizen at 18 provided they have lived in the country for five of the previous seven years.
Demographic experts say that automatic citizenship for all French-born children makes little difference to overall population trends but the issue is a hugely symbolic one at a time when immigration is rising up the political agenda. Copé's proposals were given short shrift by the Socialist government's Morocco-born spokeswoman Najat Vallaud-Belkacem, who accused the UMP leader of ""seeking to reopen a pernicious debate on national identity."" She added: ""The France that Jean-François Copé seems to dream about is one scrunched up in its own little corner. That's not the France we dream of, not the one we are building."" Leader of the anti-immigration National Front party Marine Le Pen poured scorn on Copé's new proposals as a watered-down version of the FN's ideas. ""Everyone can see this is just a mini-measure put forward by a man who could easily have implemented it when his party was in power for 10 years,"" Le Pen said. France to overhaul asylum system Separately, the government announced on Wednesday an overhaul of France's asylum procedures, in the wake of a furore over the deportation to Kosovo of a Roma family that had spent several years living in France while battling to secure refugee status. Supporters of the family argued that the length of time the children had spent in French schools should have resulted in them being allowed to stay. Interior Minister Manuel Valls said the proposed reform would seek to bring average processing times down from 16 months currently to between six and nine months. France had just under 50,000 asylum seekers as of January 1st, according tofigures from the UNHCR. Don't miss a story about France - Join us on Facebook and Twitter"

French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve said last month that Britain had agreed to contribute up to €15 million (£12 million, $19 million) to a fund to help deal with the problem after Calais's mayor threatened to close the busy cross-Channel port. France had long called on Britain to help pay for security measures at the port, where police say up to 1,500 migrants, mostly from Sudan and Eritrea, are trying to slip into trucks bound for Dover."

The interior ministers of the three countries ""have asked the Luxembourg presidency to organise a special meeting of justice and interior ministers within the next two weeks, so as to find concrete steps"" on the crisis, they said in a statement.
The call came after Germany's Thomas de Maiziere, Britain's Theresa May and France's Bernard Cazeneuve spoke on Saturday on the sidelines of a meeting in Paris on transport security.
The trio ""underlined the necessity to take immediate action to deal with the challenge from the migrant influx"".
They also called for reception centres to be set up urgently in Italy and Greece in order to register new arrivals, and for a common EU list of “safe countries of origin"" to be established.
Berlin, which is expecting to receive 800,000 asylum-seekers this year, has been pushing for such a list, arguing that it would free up resources to help those fleeing war and persecution.
The number of migrants reaching the EU's borders reached nearly 340,000 during the first seven months of the year, up from 123,500 during the same period in 2014, according to the bloc's border agency Frontex."

					16:31 CEST+02:00				",The Local,France to demand UK help ease Calais crisis,"France's Interior Minister has dismissed the prospect of a new mass shelter in Calais to house homeless migrants trying to smuggle themselves into the UK. But the so-called top cop plans to ask British authorities to ""accept their responsibilities"" for the ongoing crisis.
Just days after Calais's mayor called for putting up a temporary shelter for the hundreds of homeless, UK-bound migrants in her city, Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve quashed the idea. Instead he favours encouraging migrants to seek asylum in France. ""I don't want to create a shelter that would be a hub for migrants,"" Cazeneuve told reporters on Thursday. ""I don't want to dismantle an illegal immigration network while at the same time putting the conditions in place for the trafficking to continue."" He was responding to the surprise August 22nd call from Calais' Mayor Natacha Bouchard, a immigration hardliner, asking the state to open a shelter for migrants who use the city as a jumping off point for the perilous journey to the United Kingdom. Bouchard believes the situation for migrants and residents alike has become unbearable, especially after a series of raids on makeshift camps in Calais have done little to disperse the some 1,200 migrants living on there. SEE ALSO: Calais Migrants: 'France needs a new policy' Notorious camp The migrants live in squalid improvised shelters while waiting for opportunities to sneak into the United Kingdom, which some of them believe has more generous policies for asylum seekers. Accordingly, Bouchard wanted to put them in a 400-bed government-run facility that would be situated as far away from residential areas as possible. This idea of opening such a centre in Calais is not new. Between 1999 and 2002, France tried to get a handle on the Calais migrant situation by opening the notorious Sangatte centre, which was managed by the the Red Cross. Built for 800 people, it quickly had 2,000 migrants living in it before being closed permanently in 2003 under pressure from British authorities and Eurotunnel. Cazeneuve has warned that a new “Sangatte” would not solve this complex humanitarian problem, and that it would only encourage more migrants to flock to Calais, in the hope of crossing into the UK.
British 'responsibility' Cazeneuve said he will meet on Friday with British authorities in London and ask them to ""accept their responsibilities"" and encourage them to send representatives to Calais to discourage migrants from attempting the illegal and perilous crossing. The minister has also sent representatives to meet with local charities in order to see how the situation, without a shelter, could be improved. He added workers would also trying to convice migrants to apply for asylum in France. For her part Bouchard wants to meet with Cazeneuve to discuss ways to raise awareness within the European Union. She believes her city and the Italian island of Lampedusa, also the site of an immigration crisis, need more European funds to manage the situation. In May and again in July police raided improvised camps and squats in Calais, forcing hundreds of migrants out of their makeshift homes. The forced removals have seemingly not stemmed the tide of migrants flowing into the city, as Calais officials have seen staggering in new arrivals this year. Immigration and Security Minister, James Brokenshire suggested migrants should seek asylum in France or other European countries rather than trying to reach the UK. ""If people have a genuine need of protection they should claim asylum in the first safe country they reach,"" he said. ""Security at the UK border is our priority and we will continue to strengthen it to stop those who have no right to enter the UK. ""We are taking action at a national and international level to tackle illegal immigration, including bolstered security at Calais with improvements in technology, equipment and intelligence work."" by Léa Surugue"

					10:25 CET+01:00				",AFP,EU and Turkey strike deal to send back migrants,"EU leaders on Friday night approved a controversial deal with Turkey to curb the huge flow of asylum seekers to Europe, with all migrants arriving in Greece from Sunday to be sent back.
Finland's Prime Minister Juha Sipila said the 28 EU leaders approved Friday the deal negotiated with Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu in a bid to end an unprecedented crisis dividing the continent.
""The Turkey deal was approved,"" Sipila wrote on Twitter.
Czech Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka confirmed that the expulsion of migrants arriving on the Greek islands would begin on Sunday.
""Deal with Turkey approved. All illegal migrants who reach Greece from Turkey as of March 20 will be returned!"" Sobotka wrote on Twitter.
More than 1.2 million migrants have come to Europe since January 2015 in the continent's biggest migration crisis since World War II, and around 4,000 have drowned while trying to cross the Aegean Sea between Turkey and Greece.
But the deal comes at a heavy cost for Europe, with many members of the bloc expressing misgivings about the legality of the deal and Turkey's human rights record.
Turkey has demanded an acceleration of its long-stalled bid for EU membership, the doubling of refugee aid to €6bn ($6.8 billion) and visa-free travel in return for taking back all new irregular migrants coming to Greece, the main entry point to Europe.
Davutoglu is now set to formally sign off on the accord at a final meeting with EU leaders.
""Tusk's proposal for the EU-Turkey agreement approved by EU leaders, in principle, as it is now up for final talks with the Turkish prime minister,"" a senior EU official told AFP.
But in a sign of the tensions that remain between Ankara and Brussels, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan blasted several EU states for taking only a ""handful of refugees"" in contrast to the nearly three million Turkey has admitted, most of them fleeing the Syrian war.
Erdogan also accused the Europeans of supporting the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) days after a bombing in Ankara claimed by Kurdish rebels allegedly linked to the group.
""European countries are paying no attention, as if they are dancing in a minefield,"" he said.
Critics have said the mass expulsion planned under the EU-Turkey deal could infringe international law on the treatment of asylum seekers.
Under the terms of the plan, the EU would take in one Syrian refugee from Turkish soil in exchange for every Syrian readmitted to Turkey from Greece.
The move is meant to discourage them from risking their lives in often rickety and overcrowded boats operated by smugglers.
EU officials insisted the deal would be stressed repeatedly each application would be treated individually, with full rights of appeal and proper oversight.
EU sources said last-minute sticking points were cleared up over the deal's legality, Turkey's membership bid, the date for launching the agreement and a plan to double the amount of aid to Turkey.
Another major hurdle that was overcome was opposition from Cyprus, rooted in long-standing tensions with Turkey over Ankara's refusal to recognise its government on the divided island.
Many European Union states have expressed concerns about Ankara's human rights record, including its treatment of the Kurds and a crackdown on critics of the government.
The United Nations and rights groups fear the deal could violate international law that forbids the mass deportation of refugees.
Amnesty International set up a sign outside the summit venue: ""Don't trade refugees"".
The crisis has left Europe increasingly divided, with fears that its Schengen passport-free zone could collapse as states reintroduce border controls and concerns over the rise of populism and anti-immigrant sentiment.
The deal also envisages major aid for Greece, where tens of thousands of refugees are trapped in dire conditions after Balkan countries shut their borders to stop them heading north to richer Germany and Scandinavia.
The agreement does not however affect the more than 46,000 refugees and migrants already in Greece.
Greek Interior Minister Panagiotis Kouroublis described the overwhelmed border town of Idomeni where many of the migrants are camped out as a ""modern-day Dachau"".
British Prime Minister David Cameron was also hosting a meeting with Merkel and several other EU leaders on how to tackle migration flows from lawless Libya, which appeared to be increasing again."

French President Francois Hollande on Wednesday warned of the ""end of Europe"" if EU member states fail to remain united to tackle the refugee, euro currency and other crises.
""We need not less Europe but more Europe. Europe must affirm itself otherwise we will see the end of Europe, our demise,"" Hollande said in a landmark joint address to the European Parliament with German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
The French president also said Europe reacted too slowly to the turmoil on its borders that produced a huge wave of refugees
""I acknowledge that Europe was slow in understanding that tragedy in the Middle East or Africa could not but have consequences for Europe itself,"" he said.
For her part Merkel said that the European Union's asylum rules were ""obsolete"" as they put the burden on EU states where migrants first arrive to process claims for refugee status.
""The Dublin process, in its current form, is obsolete,"" Merkel said in a joint speech to the European Parliament with French President Francois Hollande, calling for a new procedure to spread out asylum seekers ""fairly"".
On the subject of Syria Hollande said failure to act risks stoking a ""total war"" in the Middle East.
""What happens in Syria concerns Europe, what happens there will determine the balance of the whole region for a long time,"" Hollande said.
""If we leave these religious clashes between Sunnis and Shiites, they will grow. Don't think we will be sheltered, this will be a total war.""
The historic address was the first time the leaders of the two countries have made a joint address in Strasbourg since 1989, when François Mitterrand and Helmet Kohl were in charge of the two countries.
""This is a historic visit for historically difficult times. The EU is facing immense challenges and requires strong commitment by its leaders,"" Schulz said in a statement announcing the visit.
""It is an important signal that such commitment will be made in front of Europe's democratically elected representatives,"" added Schulz.
Merkel and Hollande, the leaders of the European Union's two biggest economies, have played a leading role in a series of challenges that have gripped the 28-nation bloc, ranging from the migrant crisis to the Greek debt saga and the conflict in Ukraine."

on Tuesday after EU ministers agreed to relocate 120,000 refugees around the bloc.
""Europe has taken on its responsibilities. It has been able to do this but with conditions and with rules, and that is what France has called for,"" Hollande told reporters.
Europe has been struggling to coordinate a united response to an unprecedented influx of migrants and refugees from war-torn countries such as Syria.
""Couldn't we manage 120,000 in a continent with 450 million people? We will show that we can do this, and at the same time have rules. That is taking responsibility, that is solidarity,"" Hollande added.
The plan was bitterly opposed by the Czech Republic, Hungary, Romania and Slovakia, who argue that the European Commission does not have the right to make them take in people seeking refuge.
Asked about the possibility of sanctions for countries which did not respect Tuesday's agreement, Hollande said Europe had ""rules"".
""When you are in the European Union, it comes not just with benefits, it also means playing your part, especially when it comes to accommodating people who are in an extremely difficult situation,"" he said.
The agreement came on the eve of a key EU summit on Wednesday which is dedicated to finding ways to help countries to stop the flow of asylum seekers at sources.
Hollande's remarks came as the first refugees from war-torn Syria arrived in Britain, which is exempt from EU asylum and migration policy.
Hollande defended Britain's opposition to being part of a quota system, noting that it was ""not in the Schengen area"" of passport-free movement.
""But the United Kingdom will play its part as well in the reception of refugees, in particular in so-called resettlement,"" Hollande said.
British Prime Minister David Cameron has agreed to accept 20,000 refugees by 2020, from camps in countries bordering Syria such as Turkey and Jordan.

					11:33 CEST+02:00				",Ben McPartland,France 'must do more' to end migrant tragedies,"As the EU comes under fire over the latest boat tragedy in the Mediterranean Sea that saw hundreds of migrants drown, a leading French humanitarian organisation says France must do more to end the disasters.
France and the rest of the EU faced mounting pressure on Monday after the latest migrant boat shipwreck in the Mediterranean left up 700 people dead.
With foreign and interior ministers set for an urgent meeting there were reports that another boat carrying 300 migrants was in trouble in the same sea, that has been described as a vast cemetery.
The latest disasters come after a week in which two other shipwrecks left an estimated 450 people dead. For Jean-François Corty, from the aid organisation Medecins du Monde, the time for talking is over.
“Meetings are not enough anymore. We need concrete action and policies put in place immediately because hundreds of people are dying each week in the Mediterranean. The sea has become a vast cemetery,” Corty told The Local.
Corty, who is the director of operations in France for Medecins du Monde, says France and the rest of Europe must “either act now or simply accept the deaths of hundreds of migrants.”
“And if they don't act then we are faced with a crisis of our values,” he said.
Medecins du Monde has heavily criticized France and other EU countries for having a policy of not improving the welcome and protection offered to asylum seekers out of fear that it will simply encourage more to come.
“This argument is dead now. We can’t accept it anymore,"" Corty said
“These people will try anything to get to Europe and the government needs to take measures that correspond to this reality and to protect these people,” he added.

Corty says France must do more to help Italy, “which is on the front line in the crisis.”
Improving its welcome for asylum seekers and increasing its capacity to take in more refugees are two ways France alone could act to take the weight off Italy.
France could also deploy greater maritime resources to help rescue migrants who make the perilous journey across the Mediterranean sea from Libya or Egypt.
“France and other EU countries have to accept the idea that they must protect these people who are fleeing war or unjust regimes. These migrants are not just coming for economic reasons. They have no alternative,” he said.
Paris could also use its political influence over countries like Eritrea to try to ease the conflict in the country, which is prompting so many to flee.
The press across Europe also laid into the EU and its member states on Monday for failing to protect migrants.
France's Le Figaro suggested that Europeans go to the United Nations and ask for permission to police the Libyan coast, from where countless boats depart, profiting from the country's political strife.
President François Hollande said on Sunday that Europe “must act” against the growing catalogue of mass drownings of migrants attempting to reach its shores, and called for closer surveillance of the routes used by smugglers.
He did not however spell out what France would or could do to help ease the situation.
Hollande called for ""more boats, more aerial surveillance and an intensified fight against trafficking"".
""Because those who put these people on boats are traffickers, terrorists even, because they know these boats are lousy... and put hundreds of people in danger.""
Many of the migrants who survive the perilous boat trips to Italy make their way north to France and up to Calais where hundreds are amassed, in the hope of making it across the sea to the UK.
Corty and Medecins du Monde have been pressurizing the French government to ease the situation for the migrants in Calais, most of whom are living in squalor in makeshift camps."

The man was shot dead by French police on Thursday after he tried to storm a police station in northern Paris, brandishing a meat cleaver and wearing a fake suicide vest.
The assault took place exactly one year since the start of a series of jihadist attacks in France, marked by the killing of 12 people at the Charlie Hebdo satirical magazine on January 7th 2015.
French investigators said on Friday the suspect appeared to have been identified by his family and was said to be a Tunisian named Tarek Belgacem.
On Friday BFM TV published an image of the man, below.
The man is reported to have had a colourful past in Europe, cropping on registers across the continent in countries including Italy, Sweden, and Germany. Other reports say he was known to police in Luxembourg.
German investigators reported at the weekend that the man had lived an apartment at a shelter for asylum-seekers in Recklinghausen, in the west of the country.
On Monday, it was revealed that the man had been previously arrested in the German city of Cologne for sexually assaulting a woman, reported German newspaper Bild.
German police said that the attack took place in February 2014 after the man had touched women's ""intimate parts"", reported German news agency DPA.
The western German city of Cologne made headlines worldwide this year after police said asylum seekers were behind a spate of sexual assaults and thefts during New Year's Eve festivities, recorded 553 cases of violence during the rampage.
It has been speculated that the man may have even been involved in the New Year's Eve attacks, not least considering he had at least one friend among those arrested.
The man had already been classed by German police as a possible suspect after he posed at the refugee centre with an Isis flag, reported news site Spiegel Online
He had registered with authorities in Europe using several different nationalities, once saying he was Syrian, another time saying he was Moroccan, and on yet another occasion, Georgian.
Paris prosecutor Francois Molins had said the man was carrying a mobile phone with a German SIM card, with French media reporting that it contained several messages in Arabic, some of which were sent from Germany.
The link to a refugee shelter in Germany, and the apparent ease with which the subject was able to file with the authorities, risks further inflaming a debate over the 1.1 million asylum-seekers that the country took in last year.

His body was found at the entrance of a parking garage where he usually slept. Emergency service workers called to the scene were unable to revive him.
The man is understood to have suffered a cardiac arrest early in the morning, after the temperature dropped below 0C during the night for the third night in a row.
An autopsy is expected to confirm the cause of death.
The man had been requesting emergency accommodation since December 9th, but to no avail, reported Le Parisien.

""We cannot find the words for our anger. Losing him, just as we have lost hundreds each year, is not an inevitability but the result of senseless and irresponsible policies.,"" the group said.
Le Parisien reported that 21 homeless people have died this year alone. The average age of those people was 50. Almost 450 died in 2015.
There are around 140,000 thousand ""sans abri"" in France, meaning those who live on the streets, in parks, under bridges and in makeshift camps.
