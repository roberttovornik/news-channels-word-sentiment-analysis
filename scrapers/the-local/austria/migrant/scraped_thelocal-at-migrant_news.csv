					09:21 CEST+02:00				",AFP,Austria announces plan to 'protect border' after controversial German migrant deal,"Austria's government warned Tuesday it could ""take measures to protect"" its borders after Germany planned restrictions on the entry of migrants as part of a deal to avert a political crisis in Berlin.
If the agreement reached Monday evening is approved by the German government as a whole, ""we will be obliged to take measures to avoid disadvantages for Austria and its people,"" the Austrian government said in a statement.
It added it would be ""ready to take measures to protect our southern borders in particular,"" those with Italy and Slovenia.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel reached a compromise deal Monday on migration with her rebellious interior minister, Horst Seehofer, to defuse a bitter row that had threatened her government.
Among the proposals is a plan to send back to Austria asylum seekers arriving in Germany who cannot be returned to their countries of entry into the European Union.
Austria said it would be prepared to take similar measures to block asylum seekers at its southern borders, with the risk of a domino effect in Europe.
""We are now waiting for a rapid clarification of the German position at a federal level,"" said the statement, signed by Austria's conservative
Chancellor Sebastian Kurz and his allies of the far-right Freedom party, Vice Chancellor Heinz-Christian Strache and Interior Minister Herbert Kickl.
""German considerations prove once again the importance of a common European protection of the external borders,"" the statement said.
Kurz on Tuesday is to present before the European Parliament in Strasbourg his priorities for Austria's six-month presidency of the European Union, with the issue of migration expected to feature prominently."

					16:32 CEST+02:00				",AFP,"In Austria, migrant trainees face expulsion as attitudes harden","In a small town in northern Austria, Sylvia Hochstoeger never imagined she would become the figurehead for a protest movement.
But it was the threat of expulsion hanging over Shafi, an Afghan apprentice training at her business, which forced her to fight against an ""absurd"" situation.
""They tell you that integration is the most important thing, that you have to show that you're integrated. Shafi's done that. He's learnt German, he's found a job and he's developed a good social setting,"" she explains calmly.
With her husband, Hochstoeger runs a zinc roofing business in Pabneukirchen about 150 kilometres west of Vienna.
Shafi, 23, was recruited as an apprentice in 2016 while he waited for his asylum claim to be processed. But a few months ago, his request was turned down so he filed an appeal and is now anxiously awaiting the outcome. And he's not alone.

Around a third of the 850 candidates for asylum who are currently in training are facing the same threat, says Rudi Anschober, an MP handling integration issues in Upper Austria who has taken up the case on behalf of the businesses involved and their trainees.
In a country lacking manpower in many sectors, ""we have to take a long-term view on asylum-seekers. In this sense, apprenticeships are ideal, everyone's a winner,"" says Anschober, a member of the Green Party.
Shortage of apprentices
But in Austria, the political discourse on migrants has hardened significantly since December when Sebastian Kurz took over as chancellor at the head of a coalition grouping his centre-right People's Party (OeVP) with the far-right Freedom Party (FPOe).
Under Interior Minister Herbert Kickl, an FPOe hardliner, the expulsion of rejected asylum-seekers has become a priority, mainly targeting Afghans. The government is reducing aid for refugees, with various groups criticising the reduction in funding for different integration initiatives such as German lessons or professional coaching -- all set up by Kurz when he
was in charge of foreign affairs and integration.
""It's not necessary to run after them with millions saying: 'please, please, integrate yourselves',"" explained an FPOe spokesman recently.
Back in 2012, Austria passed a decree allowing businesses to recruit asylum-seekers as apprentices in sectors where there was a shortage of workers.
In Upper Austria alone, some 3,000 such placements remain unclaimed in a country where apprenticeships have always played a key role in the education system as young people increasingly shun a range of technical professions seen as unattractive.
90 percent success rate -
Without the three asylum-seekers working with her as apprentices, Maria Reitner says her restaurant would have ""just shut down"".
Some, however, are calling for the introduction of a two-year work permit at the end of the training. A petition has collected more than 50,000 signatures.
""The current system is absurd,"" says Hochstoeger. ""We have invested a lot of energy in training Shafi who has worked with incredible motivation. With supervision and by dint of hard work he can now follow the theoretical part of his training too.""
""Ninety percent of apprenticeship trainees are successful,"" said Rudi Anschober.
The country has registered more than 160,000 asylum requests since 2015 -- representing two percent of the population -- with arrivals declining as elsewhere in Europe for the last two years.
From villages to large cities, large sections of Austrian civil society, however, continue to mobilise to support newcomers. Monika Mayrhofer, a retiree, took in Bashar, a 20-year-old Afghan who has been doing an apprenticeship, nearly two years ago.
""Knowing Bashar changed the mind of one of his colleagues who wanted to vote FPOe. People just have to meet each other,"" she said.

Austria takes up the European Union rotating presidency on July 1 and its focus on controlling immigration will go down well with like-minded nationalist governments coming to power in the 28-nation EU, the latest in Italy.
The new Italian government said earlier this week it wanted to stop having to take in thousands of refugees crossing the Mediterranean, insisting the EU should do more to help and that economic migrants should be sent back to North Africa.
Under the EU's current Dublin rules, asylum seekers are supposed to be processed in the first country they land in but this has left Italy and Greece bearing the brunt of the problem.
EU leaders meet June 28-29 in Brussels supposedly to agree changes to the Dublin rules but talks this week failed to make much progress.
The principal sticking point is that many countries, especially in eastern European states such as Hungary and Poland, refuse to take in EU-set quotas of refugees for processing to ease the pressure on Italy and Greece.
""There will certainly be lively discussions on the quotas,"" Kurz said, adding there was general agreement on tightening control over the EU's external frontier so as to reduce the numbers of migrants coming to Europe.
Juncker said ""we must find a solution ... when that is possible.""
""If we can make progress on the frontier issue, the other questions should become secondary,"" said Juncker, who backed the quota system which was introduced at the height of the migrant crisis in 2015."

					14:29 CEST+02:00				",AFP,Austrian migrant 'propaganda' play cancelled after outrage,"The first public performance of an Austrian play about migrants has been cancelled after a critic slammed it as ""the stupidest propaganda"".
""Welt in Bewegung"" (""World in Flux"") was commissioned by the Austrian interior ministry and is about two asylum-seekers: a Syrian called Nadim fleeing the civil war and Mojo ""from Africa"", Austrian public radio reported.
""Economic migrant"" Mojo is depicted as naively leaving his unnamed home country after seeing people smugglers' YouTube videos that suggested new arrivals in Europe get 6,000 euros ($7,400), a car and a house.
After his asylum request is rejected, Mojo falls into the clutches of Islamic State extremists. Police pick him up and he is deported. But there is a happy end as he starts a family and a business back in Africa.
Polite Nadim on the other hand is well-educated, can prove he is fleeing war, makes an effort to integrate into Austrian society and learns German. He is duly granted asylum.
Other characters include two racist older Austrian women, a quote-hungry journalist and a gullible ""do-gooder"" who offers yoga courses for refugees. Mojo is even into voodoo African magic.
The play has already been shown to between 7,000 and 10,000 children aged 11-17 in schools in Vienna and elsewhere, and the first public performance was due to take place at the capital's Weltmuseum in Friday night, the radio reports said.
But the venue's online programme showed the performance as having been ""cancelled"". Radio station Oe1 reported that this was ""in order have another look at the play and the background"".
The play's author Edmund Enge told Oe1 that the roughly 350 teachers who have seen the play gave ""almost exclusively positive critique and reactions from all sides"".
However fellow public radio station FM4 quoted one unnamed teacher who had seen the play as saying it had ""put in danger years of integration work"", as well as director Tina Leisch who called it ""the stupidest propaganda"".
""What the play is about is what the ministry ordered. It's actually not a play, it's indoctrination supposed to result in thinking the right way,"" said Gerhard Ruiss from the IG-Autoren writers' collective.
Interior ministry spokesman Alexander Marakovits responded by saying: ""Things need to be simplified. Integration is a very complex issue... The message was broken down, and under professional supervision.""
""This is nothing to do with propaganda or something. This is just about conveying information,"" Marakovits told Oe1.
Herbert Kickl from the far-right Freedom Party (FPOe), who has been interior minister since December, caused a stir in January by calling for asylum seekers to be ""concentrated"".
But the play was commissioned by his predecessor from the centre-right People's Party, Wolfgang Sobotka."

				12:36 CEST+02:00			 
					12:36 CEST+02:00				",AFP,Austria proposes migrant processing at sea,"Austria's far-right Interior Minister Herbert Kickl used a meeting of his EU counterparts in Vienna Friday to suggest processing migrants on board rescue ships in the Mediterranean, rather than on land.
During a press conference with his far-right Italian counterpart Matteo Salvini, Kickl said his suggestion would be for ""those arriving on a boat in the territorial waters of an EU state"".
While not providing any more detail, Kickl said he envisaged a ""quick way to clarify which migrants are entitled to claim asylum""; they would then be brought to the EU while the others would be returned to ""safe ports"" in third countries.
Kickl said this would help solve what he called the ""problem of repatriation"". ""Once people have set foot on the continent, you can only remove them with great difficulty and much expense,"" he said.
He added that the aim of the EU's asylum policy should be to make it ""impossible to claim asylum except from outside the EU, and that claims be decided outside the EU"".
The Austrian branch of the medical charity Doctors Without Borders (MSF) condemned Kickl's remarks.
""This proposal is simply another attempt to distract attention from the real issue, namely the inability of Europe and of Austria's EU presidency to find a sustainable solution to the humanitarian crisis in the central Mediterranean and Libya,"" MSF said in a statement.
The group urged leaders to ""put the protection of human life at the centre of their efforts"".
Salvini said he supported the proposal of his Austrian colleague, with whom he has formed a controversial anti-immigration ""axis"" along with their German counterpart Horst Seehofer.
Kickl and Salvini both want to put pressure on other EU states to consider more ""radical"" ideas to reduce the number of migrants reaching Europe.
This week's meeting in Vienna brought together ministers and officials from the EU as well as African states to discuss cooperation on migration policy.
'Impossible' idea
Kickl also criticised the EU's migration commissioner Dimitris Avramopoulos for his reticence towards the idea of ""disembarkation platforms"" for migrants in unspecified third countries, which was endorsed by EU leaders at a summit in June.
Avramopoulos was also at the meeting and repeated his scepticism of the idea, calling it ""impossible"" because of the lack of a host country.
""This idea is only two months old and already the Commissioner is throwing in the towel,"" Kickl said, branding Avramopoulos's statements a ""bad signal"" that could ""free African states from their obligation"" to cooperate.
Egypt, Tunisia and Morocco -- who sent representatives to the Vienna meeting -- have all been approached about hosting such centres but all have refused.
Kickl said that on migration issues, ""one would think that we have different interests but the problems are shared"" between Africa and Europe.
Avramopoulos also underlined the need for more EU-African cooperation.
Despite the considerable fall in the numbers of migrants arriving in Europe since the crisis of 2015, the issue of immigration continues to be one of the most contentious within the EU and is expected to be high on the agenda when EU leaders meet for an informal summit in the Austrian city of Salzburg on Wednesday and Thursday next week.

The move, which sees the officers carrying out checks on the motorway and on trains at the Brenner pass crossing, comes less than two weeks after Austria said it would no longer re-impose controls at the pass after tougher measures from Rome led to a huge drop in migrant numbers.
A police chief in Tirol told Ansa that the move “is not about checkpoints or border controls” but is intended to “contain the number of people who enter Austria illegally”.
The officers have been deployed near the Schönberg motorway toll booth, about 30 kilometres from the border, and on the road that runs between the town of Gries am Brenner and Innsbruck.
In total, 80 officers are patrolling the area.
Meanwhile, Italy earlier this month deployed 110 extra guards to patrol the Brenner pass crossing point between the two countries, prompted by Austria's threats, including building a fence, to tighten anti-migrant measures if Italy failed to reduce the number of new arrivals heading to Austria.
Austria has been concerned that it could also become a new route for migrants and refugees following the closure of the Balkan trail leading from Greece towards western and northern Europe."

Austrian filmmaker Michael Haneke, two-time winner of the Palme d'Or at Cannes, will soon begin shooting a movie touching on the migrants issue around the northern French port of Calais, local officials said on Wednesday.
Haneke and his team scouted the area in recent weeks with a view to start filming ""Happy End"" in early 2016, said Pictanovo, a group that organizes financing for films in the region.
Northern France has already made headlines in Hollywood this week after it was announced that blockbuster director Christopher Nolan, who made the recent Batman trilogy and ""Interstellar"", would soon film a World War II movie in Dunkirk.
Nolan's movie about the legendary evacuation of British troops from Dunkirk is due to start filming in May.
In recent years, thousands of migrants and refugees have ended up in squalid camps around the port in Calais as they try to make their way to Britain.
A spokesman for Pictanovo said migrants would not be the subject of Haneke's movie, but would be ""evoked and integrated in the issues of the film"".
Haneke recently joined over 5,000 other film professionals, including actress Juliette Binoche and director Costa-Gavras, in calling for a more robust response to the refugee crisis from Europe.
""Happy End"" will reunite stars Jean-Louis Trintignant and Isabelle Huppert from his last, Oscar-nominated, film ""Amour"".
He is one of very few directors to twice win the top prize at the Cannes Film Festival - for ""Amour"" in 2012 and ""The White Ribbon"" in 2009."

Austria has diverted three of four lanes on the A13 motorway (Die Brennerautobahn) – 25 kilometres away from the Italian border – and has placed soldiers at a frontier railway station.
Hundreds of cars and trucks coming from Italy have been stopped and searched on the A13 motorway, according to a report in Italian daily Repubblica.
At least 15 soldiers are also on duty at Matrei am Brenner train station, checking passenger and cargo trains arriving from Italy, claims the daily.
It added that two women and six men, from West African nations Nigeria, Burkina Faso and Ivory Coast, were found alive hiding in the empty fuel tank of a train, normally reserved for liquified gas.
Austria recently announced it would send army back-up to help police its borders. The measures are in response to efforts by illegal migrants to enter Austria from Italy. Between 700 and 1,000 illegal immigrants are stopped in Tyrol every month, states a report in German newspaper zeit.de.
Yet official Austrian government statistics show that the number of asylum applications more than halved from 88,000 in 2015 to 42,000 in 2016.
""Surprising and unjustified""
The Italian government expressed its disappointment at Austria's military build-up on its shared border in early July, with Interior Minister Marco Minniti calling the move ""surprising and unjustified"".
The disappointment had little impact on the neighbour's decision-making process. ""We must decide ourselves who enters our country and who doesn't,"" says Austrian Integration Minister Sebastian Kurz, cited in Austria's Der Standard daily.
""Migration to Austria is still at a level that is too high,"" said Minister Kurz in a statement released on Wednesday.
Austria had originally said there was no need for a hard border with Italy but appears to have u-turned recently in light of attempts by migrants to reach Austria from Italy via quieter border crossings.
Kurz had previously asked Italy to prevent migrants from reaching its mainland from Italian islands like Lampedusa, where many migrants and refugees first land in Europe.
""We hope that ferry services for illegal migrants will be halted between Italian islands like Lampedusa and the Italian mainland,"" Kurz said in July this year.
In 2015, Austria – like Germany – opened its borders to refugees fleeing conflicts in Syria, the Middle East and Central Asia, only to close them again in late 2016.
Austrian Interior Minister Wolfgang Sobotka however, careful to toe the EU's official line, says national borders can only exist within Schengen when other nations fail to secure their own borders.
""The removal of border controls within the Schengen area is justifiable for me only if the European external borders are adequately protected. As long as this does not succeed, there is no way of passing national measures,"" said Sobotka.
Earlier this month, The Local Italy reported that Austria had sent 70 soldiers to patrol the border with Italy in response to 16,000 asylum cases in the first half of 2017 and an apparent increase in the number of illegal migrants trying to reach Austria by rail and road from Italy.
Integration expert Kenan Küngör, cited in Austrian newspaper Der Standard, argues that Austria's new-found ""pessimism"" towards migration may be to do with having ""not received the gratitude"" it expected after opening its borders in 2015.
It is also to do with a ""desire for control"" in the face of ""the future uncertainty surrounding migration,"" argues Küngör.
Other experts say Sobotka's Austrian People's Party is taking a more conservative stand on migration to keep out the far right in legislative elections expected on October 15th, 2017.
Meanwhile, the number of new migrant arrivals by sea from North Africa to Italy more than halved between June and July 2017, according to UNHCR data.

He died in a hospital near Vienna on Monday after being admitted a day earlier, police said. It was unclear how he killed himself.
The boy and his family had been living in a refugee centre in Baden, south of the capital, since last year, when a record influx of migrants arrived in Austria.
Media reports said the boy felt unable to cope with looking after his six siblings after his 23-year-old elder brother left him in charge.
According to public broadcaster Oe1, officials had been made aware of the family's precarious situation but failed to react.

Moussa, a 37-year-old from Mali, waits at Brenner station everyday in the hope that the kindly guard will finally let him board a train to Munich.
He arrived in southern Italy by boat via Libya eight months ago, before making his way to the northern border with Austria in the hope of eventually being able to join his brother in Germany.
Clutching his only form of identification - a piece of paper proving he has a permit to stay in Italy - he said he sometimes spends the night on the station floor.
“My brother managed to get from here to Germany about five months ago,” he told The Local, just after being prevented from getting on the Munich train, which passes through Austria, on Friday afternoon.
""He keeps telling me to go to Germany. It's better for work there,"" added Moussa, a mechanic by trade. ""I can stay here, but it's impossible to work.""
His brother’s unhindered journey came before Italy was forced to send extra guards to reinforce patrols at the Alpine Brenner Pass crossing point after Austria threatened to step-up anti-migrant controls.
Austria, which last year accepted 90,000 asylum requests, hinted at building a 375-metre long fence unless Italy stemmed the flow of migrants. The threats to raise the boundaries sparked protests from pro-migrant activists.

Fearing the impact on trade – the historic Brenner Pass is a crucial lifeline for exports to northern Europe – Italy was swift to react, eventually leading Austria to back down on its threats on Friday.
“He has no passport, if I let him cross into Austria he’d immediately be sent back,” the train guard told The Local.
“He has a permit to stay in Italy, I can’t let him pass.”
The guard added that while other migrants still came to the station each day, the number had dropped significantly in recent weeks.
Until last summer, the mountainous South Tyrol, Italy’s richest region, was relatively untouched by the migrant crisis.
Before then, most would make their way up to Ventimiglia, in the hope of crossing over to France. That was until French authorities effectively ‘closed’ the border, forcibly removing people from trains and carrying out stringent checks of cars and even mountain paths.
Exacerbated by its own influx, Austria has also sent hundreds back to Italy.
A centre, capable of hosting 70 migrants, was set up in Brenner last year as it became a prominent transit hub.
“The centre assisted 17,000 people over the course of the year,” the mayor of Brenner, Franz Kompatscher, told The Local.
But few of those people stayed in the town, he added, admitting he had “no idea” where the rest end up.
“Some wait in Brenner, but for the most part, they don’t stay.”
Under a government plan, South Tyrol, which has a population of 511,000, must take in 0.9 percent of the total number of migrants who seek asylum in Italy.
As the measure got underway last year, migrant centres were hurriedly built across the region, with the majority being housed in the city of Bolzano. Apart from Brenner, other centres, managed by the charity, Caritas, have sprung up in Vipiteno, Malles, Tesimo, Vandoies, Val di Vizze and Brunico.
But the arrivals have created social challenges, with some 240 asylum seekers sleeping rough on the streets of Bolzano, according to recent reports in the local press.
Meanwhile, migrant arrivals have sparked “a war among the poor” in Vipiteno, local businessman Roberto Giordani told The Local.
“Until a couple of years ago, there was no Caritas here,” he said.
“Now around 300 families in Vipiteno depend on it. But there is resentment over the €35 a day that goes to each migrant.”
The patience of locals, especially in Bolzano, has also been put to the test. In late December, the prestigious Museion Bozen-Bolzano turned off its free wifi because the service was attracting too many migrants.
And although few are in Brenner, residents there are worried that the summer could bring more than the area can handle.
Italy last week eclipsed Greece in terms of migrant arrivals for the first time since June 2015, with 8,370 landing in April alone.
“People are generally open in this region – but only up to a certain point,” Kompatscher said."

					11:39 CET+01:00				", The Local,Teacher warns of 'lost generation' of migrant kids,"A teacher in Vienna has spoken out again about the lack of German skills among students at her school, despite the Education Ministry suggesting she keeps her opinions to herself.
Vienna school director Andrea Walach had warned of “a lost generation” of children of migrant families at her school due to their difficulty learning German.
She estimated that a third of those who do not speak good German would struggle in later life because they are “not employable” and would rely on further state support.
After she gave an interview to the Kurier newspaper at the weekend, the headteacher received a letter that had been sent from the Education Ministry to the school inspector, where they suggested the inspector might like to offer her some guidance.
“And, if I had so few ideas, I should take care not to make my views known publically,” she said, describing what the Ministry wrote in the letter that was forwarded on to her.
The ministry told the newspaper that they wouldn’t enforce a gagging order on the teacher, although the Education Minister has not commented on the issue as she is away on a state trip.
Walach says that around 98 percent of students at her middle school don’t see German as their mother tongue, including both refugees who have recently arrived to Vienna and children who are born in Austria to migrant families.
“There are children who were born in Vienna, whose parents have already lived in Vienna for many years, but who have been brought up in their mother tongue for the first six years, barely know a word of German, haven’t read any picture books or watched German language TV. That means if they come to school they begin with language acquisition,” she said in an interview with the ORF this week.
Nationwide, around one in five children speak a foreign language at home and in Vienna’s Kindergartens around 58 percent of children don’t speak German as their mother language.
The headteacher added that her teachers are already stretched providing extra lessons and support should come from other areas, such as social workers, as the circumstances some of the children live in “are so complicated”.
“I know that the teachers need vigorous support from support staff. It shouldn’t be the teacher calling the house early in the morning, waking up the child and saying ‘you should come to school now’. For that, I would like to have support staff, for example social workers,” she said.
Bolstering the support from social workers in Vienna schools is already under discussion in the city council, which has pledged to set aside €24 million for this purpose.
Walach added that she believes making it mandatory for children to attend kindergarten for at least two years before school is one solution.
Many opposition parties have criticised the apparent attempt by the Education Minsitry to silence the teacher, with the Green party submitting a question to parliament asking if that was the usual way they responded to teachers' concerns.
Green Party chairman David Ellensohn said: ""We should not allow Vienna teachers to be silenced. We need to hear this information first hand in order to respond appropriately.”"

					08:18 CEST+02:00				",The Local/AFP,Migrant crisis to hijack western Balkans summit,"Europe's raging migrant crisis is set to hijack a summit in Vienna of leaders from the western Balkans region on Thursday that will also be attended by German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
When it was announced a year ago, the gathering of a slew of heads of government and ministers as well as EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini was meant to be about regional cooperation and prospects for joining the EU.
But the ""western Balkans route"" has now become one of the main ways into the European Union for the several hundreds of thousands of migrants entering the bloc this year in Europe's worst refugee crisis since World War II.
Some 102,000 migrants entered the EU via Macedonia, Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Albania, Montenegro or Kosovo between January and July this year, versus just 8,000 for the same period in 2014, according to EU border agency Frontex.
Last week Macedonia declared a state of emergency after being overwhelmed by the volume of refugees entering from Greece, closing the border for three days as police used stun grenades to stop people breaking through.
At least 7,000 people have since made it to Serbia, hoping to follow the roughly 100,000 others who have crossed over into EU member Hungary this year before a razor-wire barrier is completed by August 31.
Summit host Austria, which borders Hungary and fellow ""front line"" state Italy, will present at the conference a five-point plan.
It involves doing more to tackle people-trafficking gangs, a ""fairer"" distribution of refugees around the EU, greater security cooperation, helping the countries where the migrants come from and a ""pan-European asylum strategy"".
""It's a humanitarian disaster, a disaster for the European Union as a whole, and there is a pressing need for us to focus on the situation in the western Balkans,"" Austrian Foreign Minister Sebastian Kurz said on Monday.
""We have to find a new strategy to support Greece and the western Balkan countries,"" Kurz said on a visit to see the crisis in Macedonia for himself.
'Disastrous' economic situation
But it's not just about people fleeing violence in places like Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan. The impoverished countries in the western Balkans are themselves the source of huge numbers of migrants.
Of the 44,000 irregular migrants detected crossing between western Balkan countries and between these countries and the EU in the first quarter of 2015, 27,000 were nationals of the region, according to Frontex.
According to Dusan Reljic at the German Institute for International and Security Affairs (SWP), this is because the economic situation there is ""disastrous"", with growth non-existent, unemployment sky high and investment feeble.
""In Macedonia the average monthly salary is €350 ($410), less than in China,"" the Balkans expert told AFP. ""Something like half of the people applying for asylum in Germany are from the western Balkans.""
The credibility of prospects of these countries joining the EU ""has largely evaporated, and the poorest of the poor have abandoned hopes of improvement and ever achieving a life with dignity.""

					15:25 CEST+02:00				",The Local/AFP,Eight face charges over Austria migrant truck deaths,"Hungarian police will seek charges against eight suspects after completing a probe into the deaths of 71 migrants and refugees found in a truck in Austria last year, in a case that sent shockwaves through Europe.
""The investigation has been completed... Police will recommend to prosecutors that they press charges against eight suspects,"" said Zoltan Boross, head of the police's anti-migrant trafficking unit.
In total, seven Bulgarians and an Afghan -- considered the ringleader -- have been remanded in custody over the gruesome tragedy.
Four are accused of manslaughter, while another four could face charges of organised human trafficking, Boross told journalists in Budapest. A further three suspects remain at large, he added.
The badly decomposing bodies of the 71 people were found inside an abandoned refrigerator truck in a layby in Burgenland state, close to the Hungarian border on August 27th, 2015.
The stench of human decay emanated from the container where bodies lay piled on top of each other, crammed into a small rectangular space. Among them was a baby girl, not even a year old.
Budapest took over the case last November, because the 59 men, eight women and four children were thought to have suffocated while the lorry was still in Hungary.
Investigations revealed that the migrants -- mostly from Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan -- had been picked up at Hungary's border with Serbia and transported to Austria via Budapest.
An autopsy showed they had most likely died from lack of oxygen shortly after leaving the Hungarian capital.
""The perpetrators knew by the time they crossed the Hungarian-Austrian border that the passengers were dead,"" Boross said.
The case sparked international revulsion, highlighting the plight of desperate people putting their lives in the hands of traffickers.
""This was a tragic example of how ruthless the criminal gangs are,"" said Robert Crepinko, the anti-smuggling chief of Europe's police agency Europol, at the press conference in Budapest. ""We see a number of criminal gangs operating across Europe making their profits regardless of the risks put on migrants lives.""
The continent's worst migration crisis since World War II has turned people smuggling into a booming criminal market, generating up to €6 billion a year, according to Crepinko.
The Budapest-based ring was a professional network with more than 15 vehicles used to transport refugees who were trekking up from Greece along the western Balkans to reach western Europe.
The group had smuggled more than 1,100 people from Hungary into Austria since February 2015, charging between €1,100 and €1,500 per refugee, investigators said.
The Afghan ringleader had arrived as an asylum-seeker in Hungary in 2013 and was granted protection status.
He had Afghan helpers in Serbia -- another key transit country on the Balkan migrant trail -- who brought the migrants to the Hungarian border.
Of the 71 victims found in the truck, all except one have been identified. Most were repatriated to their home countries, while a dozen have been buried at a Muslim cemetery in Vienna."

					08:41 CEST+02:00				",AFP,EU ministers meet in Innsbruck as migration tension continues,"Interior ministers from 28 European nations will meet on Thursday as they face intensifying pressure to introduce new policies to stem migrant arrivals, in their first meeting after Austria took the EU helm wit promises of a tough response to the issue.
The meeting in Innsbruck will focus in particular on coming up with a common migration plan, with Austria expected to push to change the EU's migration policy so it is no longer possible to make asylum requests on European soil.
Although the number of migrants fleeing war and poverty has fallen sharply since a 2015 peak the issue is a thorny one in Europe and a key topic for the six-month presidency of Austria, where a conservative far-right coalition took power last December.
Austria's hardline interior minister Herbert Kickl, of the far-right FPOE party, told journalists earlier this week that he would propose asylum requests be made in refugee camps outside Europe to ""a sort of mobile commission"".
Only exiles from countries that directly border the European Union would be able to make their asylum requests on EU territory.
Kickl is likely to join forces with his Italian counterpart Matteo Salvini, also deputy prime minister and leader of the far-right League party.
Salvini has banned NGO rescue boats that pick up migrants in the Mediterranean from docking in Italy, accusing them of aiding human traffickers to bring migrants to Europe.
In Innsbruck, which has been described as an informal meeting, he is expected to ask nations not to send ships on international missions to Italian ports.
The issue of migration and asylum rights in Europe has raised tensions among the EU's 28 member states.
Austria currently holds the rotating EU presidency, which gives it the opportunity to chair meetings and set agendas.
Germany's interior minister Horst Seehofer said on Wednesday that he hopes to reach an agreement with Italy by the end of the month on the vexed topic of returning migrants there from Germany.
A migrant deal with Rome is central to the compromise German Chancellor Angela Merkel reached with Seehofer to end a row over immigration within their coalition that has threatened to bring down the government.
Salvini said he and Seehofer shared a ""common objective: fewer landings, fewer deaths, fewer migrants in Italy as well as in Germany"".
But the Italian minister said he expected to see more action to toughen the EU's external frontiers before agreeing to any deal to take back migrants.
Kickl told the European Parliament on Monday that the Innsbruck meeting would be the first time ""we will talk more concretely about the issue of disembarkation platforms"" outside the EU for migrants rescued in international waters.
But European nations are divided on the feasibility and legality of these ""platforms"" which several countries like Morocco and Tunisia have already said they would not host."

""I will only speak once I've heard what my associates have had to say,"" 30-year-old Afghan Samsoor L. told the court in the Hungarian town of Kecskemet.
He added however: ""I know what is true (in the charge sheet) and what is false. Some parts are correct, others are false.""
The discovery on a baking-hot day in August 2015 of the decomposing bodies -- giving off a noxious stench -- in the back of a refrigerated poultry lorry sparked international revulsion.
The trial is being held in Hungary because 59 men, eight women and four children including a baby girl suffocated in Hungary soon after being picked up near the Serbian border.
Samsoor L. and three suspected accomplices have been charged with murder ""with particular cruelty"", while another seven suspects are accused of human trafficking and torture.
The group is believed to have transported more than 1,100 people to Austria and Germany at the height of Europe's migrant crisis two years ago, netting at least 300,000 euros ($335,000).

Samsoor L. has rejected the charges against him, telling police after his arrest that he was a simple car salesman.
On the opening day of the trial, flashing a smile, he held up a sign in Pashto language reading: ""I am neither a killer, nor an oppressor"".
'Greedy'
The Afghan's alleged right-hand man, a 31-year-old Bulgarian named as Metodi G., also refused to respond to the charges on Thursday.
But a statement he gave at the time of his arrest was read out in court in which he admitted acquiring vehicles and drivers on Samsoor L.'s orders, making clear that he was running the show.
""Samsoor was the boss of the whole operation. At first everything went well but he got more and more greedy and wanted to transport more and more people,"" the statement quoted him as saying.
However he insisted the migrants' deaths had been an accident and said that at one point the truck had pulled over into a rest area in order to open the doors and give the migrants some fresh air.
""But a police car came and the driver panicked and took off without opening the lorry,"" the Bulgarian told police.
""Nobody wanted that these migrants die... If I thought I was responsible I'd kill myself.""

Half an hour after the departure, they started to bang and shout that they were running out of air but Samsoor L. ordered the driver to ignore their screams, transcripts of intercepted mobile phone conversations suggest.
""If they die... drop them off in a forest in Germany,"" he was quoted as saying in the conversations recorded by Hungarian police but only listened to later.
The trial is expected to continue for several months, with a verdict expected at the end of the year at the earliest."

					08:39 CEST+02:00				", The Local,Austria raises 'migrant fence' on Italian border,"Austria has begun building an anti-migrant barrier across the Brenner pass at the Italian border.
""The structure will be 250 metres long and will cover both the motorway and the main road,"" Helmut Tomac, the head of the police in the southern Austrian state of Tyrol was reported by Italian newspaper La Stampa as saying.
The guardrails of the motorway and main road are already being taken apart to make way for the barrier and road signs are set to be modified.
In addition to the barrier, a new registration centre will also be built on the Austrian side of the border, while traffic checks could be carried out as early as May from a car park just inside Austria.
The new barrier comes amid Austrian fears that the country is set to see a wave of asylum seekers from Italy following the closure of the so-called 'Balkan route' earlier this year. So far at least, these fears have been unfounded.
The construction of the barrier follows a meeting between Italy's Interior Minister, Angelino Alfano and the then Austrian Interior Minister, Johanna Mikl-Leitner in Rome on Friday, at which the pair outlined their desire to work together at the border to ""safeguard the Schengen principles.""
""This wall violates Schengen rules and is further proof that we are working in small national groups instead of trying to find a common solution,"" said Gianni Pitella, president of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats, the second largest political group in the European Parliament.
Tomac, who is overseeing the building work, said however that the fence is not to stop people from getting in.
""The fence is not there to close the doors to Austria, but to make it possible to securely control entry,"" he was quoted as saying in the Kurier.
Mikl-Leitner, who had spearheaded Austria's tough stance against migrants in recent months and attempt to build 'fortress Europe', has stepped down from her post as Interior Minister over the weekend.
Since replacing her, the new minister Wolfgang Sobotka has said he will continue with the same hardline course of action.
Austria has set an upper limit of 37,500 for the number of asylum applications it is prepared to accept this year, which it is expected to reach by the summer. Last year the country accepted 90,000 asylum applications."

					19:31 CEST+02:00				",The Local/AFP,Migrant spat brews between Austria and Hungary,"Hungary refused on Thursday to take back any of the several thousand migrants that Austria says should be returned under EU rules, adding to a brewing spat between the two neighbours.
""(It) is clear that Hungary cannot take back these migrants,"" Defence Minister Istvan Simicsko told a joint news conference in Budapest with visiting Austrian counterpart Hans Peter Doskozil.
""In order to take them back they would have had to begin their journey here. But... they crossed several countries before arriving in Hungary. They didn't suddenly get here by magic, they crossed several safe countries"", including Greece, Simicsko said.
Under the European Union's much-criticised Dublin Treaty, asylum claims must be processed by the first EU member state in which refugees arrive. Several countries have suspended sending them back to Greece however.
Austria, which saw 90,000 people claim asylum last year, the second highest per capita in the EU, says that there are several thousand migrants that Hungary should take back.
The Austrian defence ministry says around 150 migrants arrive in Austria every day from Hungary -- where most of them are registered -- having travelled from Greece through Macedonia, Bulgaria and Serbia.
Currently Austria is not sending any back to Hungary following a court decision last September that prevented an Afghan family being returned because of ""inhumane conditions"" in Hungary.
An Austrian interior ministry spokesman, Karl-Heinz Grundboeck, said however that this concerned an individual case and did not prevent people being sent back in the future.
""We have very clear expectations of Hungary. Hungary is after all a member of the EU, the Schengen zone and is party to Dublin. Of course our expectation is that in a Europe with this legal framework, returns to Hungary are possible,"" Grundboeck told AFP.
He said that ministry officials would travel to Hungary later this month. A meeting of the interior and defence ministers of Austria, Hungary and Slovenia is planned soon, the Austria Press Agency reported.
Hungary has long been criticised for its treatment of migrants, having sealed its border with Serbia last year with razor wire and making illegal border crossing a criminal offence punishable by jail.
This week the UN refugee agency (UNHCR) sharply criticised Hungary for conditions at a makeshift transit camp on the border with Serbia for people waiting to be admitted into Hungarian ""transit zones"".
""We remain concerned about Hungary's restrictive approaches and the dire situation asylum-seekers face outside the transit zones. Currently, only 15-17 people are admitted daily at each zone, leaving hundreds to suffer day and night without any proper support at the EU border,"" said Samar Mazloum, head of UNHCR's local field office.
""The current approach makes it very easy for human traffickers to further exploit desperate refugees and pushes them to take more dangerous routes when legal ways are shut."""

The incidents, revealed in a response by the interior ministry to a parliamentary enquiry, ranged from racist graffiti to arson, stones being thrown through windows and gas pipes being slashed.
According to opposition lawmaker Albert Steinhauser who made the enquiry, 44 of the incidents that were clearly motivated by hatred.
Steinhauser told the Austria Press Agency (APA) that in 77 percent of the cases, police had not managed to track down the culprits.
""The most important thing is for the interior ministry to take these incidents seriously and make every necessary effort to investigate,"" he said.
He said that no one wanted a situation like in neighbouring Germany -- where the population is around 10 times larger -- which reported almost 900 such cases in 2016.
Austria, a nation of 8.7 million people, has received more than 130,000 asylum applications since 2015 following the onset of the European Union's biggest migration crisis since World War II.
The opposition far-right Freedom Party (FPÖ) has stoked concerns about the influx to boost support, with its candidate Norbert Hofer coming close to being elected president last year.
The ruling centrist coalition has taken a harder line, announcing plans to beef up surveillance, ban full-face veils in public and oblige migrants to sign an ""integration contract"".
It has also stepped up deportations of migrants whose asylum claims are rejected, recently offering €1,000 ($1,069) to the first 1,000 people to volunteer for repatriation.
Chancellor Christian Kern also wrote to Brussels this week looking for Austria to be exempted from an EU scheme to take in migrants relocated from hotspots Italy and Greece.
Recent studies have also shown a sharp rise in online hate speech, directed predominantly at Muslims, and suggested that Austrians' attitudes toward immigration have hardened.
The interior ministry said there were also 49 incidents carried out by migrants themselves at the shelters including violence, death threats, stalking and vandalism. No comparison figures from prior years were released.
""We have to look closely at what the causes are. We strongly suspect that trauma, experiences of war and extreme violence play a role,"" Steinhauser said, calling for better psychiatric care."

hundreds of failed asylum-seekers back to Turkey, which is racing to set up
reception centres under a controversial EU deal.
Some 750 migrants are set to be sent back between Monday and Wednesday, Greek state news agency ANA said, the first wave of deportations under the much-criticised agreement struck last month.
All irregular migrants now face being sent back from the Greek islands to Turkey, as Europe grapples with its worst migration crisis since World War II.
Greece has been struggling to get the infrastructure in place under its side of the deal, which has been met with scepticism by EU members like Austria, while the United Nations argues it is illegal.
""Planning is in progress,"" Yiorgos Kyritsis, spokesman for Greece's refugee coordination unit, told AFP.
ANA said the migrants would be sent back from the island of Lesbos to the Turkish port of Dikili, adding that EU border agency Frontex had chartered two Turkish leisure vessels for the operation.
There will be one Frontex agent onboard for every single migrant, ANA said. Kyritsis declined to comment on the report.
On the other side of the Aegean Sea, work is under way on a centre to host those sent back in the Turkish tourist resort of Cesme, town mayor Muhittin Dalgic said.
Another is being created in Dikili, opposite Lesbos, one of several Greek islands that has seen a massive influx of people fleeing conflict and poverty in the Middle East and elsewhere.
Turkish media reports say the Turkish Red Crescent is also preparing to open a refugee camp with capacity for 5,000 people further inland in Manisa.
'Hell to hell'
The deal is the latest attempt to stem the number of people in search of a new life in Europe. More than a million migrants entered last year, and over 150,000 people have crossed the Aegean Sea to Greece in 2016.
For every Syrian refugee sent back under the deal, another Syrian refugee will be resettled from Turkey to the EU, with the numbers capped at 72,000.
""If they make me go back to Turkey I'll throw myself and my family into the sea,"" said Mustafa, a Syrian waiting with his wife and children at the port of Chios island. ""We went from hell to hell.""
""There are many things happening in Turkey right now that I don't like""
Austria's president Heinz Fischer said Saturday he was ""sceptical"" the deal would stop more migrants coming to Europe, voicing his concern about human rights abuses in Turkey.
""There are many things happening in Turkey right now that I don't like,"" he told Austrian public radio O1.
The deal has also faced strong opposition from rights groups, and senior UN migration official Peter Sutherland said Saturday that the deal was ""absolutely"" illegal.
""Collective deportations without having regard to the individual rights of those who claim to be refugees are illegal,"" he told BBC radio. ""Their rights have to be absolutely protected where they are deported to -- in other words Turkey.""
Amnesty International said this week that Turkey was not a ""safe country"" for refugees, reporting that Ankara was forcing around 100 Syrians to return to their war-torn country every day.
Turkey rejected the criticism, with the foreign ministry saying Saturday ""the allegations do not reflect reality in any way"".
Migrants sent to Germany
As part of the same EU-Ankara deal, Turkey -- which is hosting some 2.7 million refugees from neighbouring Syria -- will on Monday begin sending a first batch of refugees directly to Germany.
Germany's interior ministry said most of the arrivals expected Monday would be families with children, putting the number in the ""double-digit range"".
Hundreds of migrants continue to land in Greece every day despite the EU deal, and a Greek government source told AFP this week that some 400 Frontex police officers were expected to arrive over the weekend.
Fifty French riot police were arriving on Lesbos Saturday to help with the operation, with asylum experts to follow later in this week.
Clashes have also broken out at Greek facilities, and on Friday hundreds of migrants walked out of a registration centre on Chios following fresh violence, prompting a leading medical charity to pull out its staff.
Many of them headed to the port hoping to reach ships bound for the Greek mainland, but authorities rerouted the island ferry to another local harbour to prevent unauthorised boardings.
Over 52,000 refugees and migrants seeking to reach northern Europe are already stuck in Greece after Balkan states sealed their borders to stop the influx."

""I am extremely critical,"" Johanna Mikl-Leitner told ORF public radio from Brussels ahead of a two-day meeting of EU interior ministers to chew over the proposed agreement.
""I am seriously wondering whether we are taking ourselves and our values seriously or if we are throwing them overboard,"" she said.
The mooted deal between Ankara and Brussels, discussed at an EU summit on Monday and due to be finalised on March 17th-18th, would see Turkey take back all illegal migrants landing in Greece.
Ankara proposed an arrangement under which the EU would resettle one Syrian refugee from camps in Turkey in exchange for every Syrian that Turkey takes from Greece, in a bid to reduce the incentive for people to board boats for Europe.
In return though, Turkey wants billions of euros in aid, visa-free access to Europe's passport-free Schengen zone and a speeding up of Ankara's efforts to join the EU - demands that go too far for some.
In addition, questions have been raised over the legality of the plans as well as the desirability of doing a deal with a country that critics say has had a shaky human rights record, not least regarding the media and its Kurdish minority.
Mikl-Leitner noted that only a few days before Monday's summit, Turkish police raided the offices of daily newspaper Zaman to impose a court order placing it under administration, dispersing protesters with tear gas and water cannon.
""I think it's questionable if Turkey takes control of a newspaper critical of the government and then turns up here (in Brussels) three days later and puts a wish list on the table,"" she said.
""And then Turkey is rewarded with discussions about bringing forward visa liberalisation,"" she said, suggesting that any deal with Ankara should include a ""termination clause"".
Turkey deal follows closure of Balkan route led by Austria
The deal with Turkey was struck in part because of the huge numbers of refugees now left trapped in Greece.
The situation became critical after Austria's introduction of a refugee cap of 37,500 for this year set off a chain of border controls throughout the Balkans.
With Austria's desire to close the Balkan route for migrant and refugees now fulfilled, Mikl-Leitner said in a separate interview with Germany newspaper Die Welt that the ""clock will not be turned back"".
She said: ""My position is clear — the Balkan route will remain closed, and permanently."""

Since 8am, a maximum of 80 migrants per day are being allowed to claim asylum in the country, police said.
In addition, Vienna is limiting the daily number of people transiting Austria to seek asylum in a neighbouring country to 3,200.
Once the quotas have been reached, ""the borders will be closed,"" police spokesman Fritz Grundnig told AFP.
He added that due to bad weather, no migrant had arrived at the Austrian-Slovenian frontier since Thursday afternoon.
Vienna's measures -- announced earlier this week along with tougher controls at 12 checkpoints along its southern borders -- drew an angry reaction from the EU on Thursday.
""Such a policy would be plainly incompatible with Austria's obligations under European and international law,"" European migration commissioner Dimitris Avramopoulos complained in a letter to Austrian Interior Minister Johanna Mikl-Leitner.
European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker also criticised the proposal. ""As far as Austria is concerned I have to say I don't like this decision, we are questioning whether it is within European law, and we will have a friendly discussion,"" Juncker told a news conference.
But Austrian Chancellor Werner Faymann said there ""will be no lifting of the decision,"" speaking at a two-day EU summit.
Speaking to French radio during the Brussels summit, French President
Francois Hollande bluntly warned the end of Schengen would mean ""the end of Europe, in the sense of free circulation among Europeans.""
The deep rifts within the 28-nation bloc have opened as a result of
Europe's biggest migration crisis since World War II.
More than 80,000 people -- many of them children -- have endured the
perilous journey across the Aegean Sea since January, with most fleeing war and violence in Syria, Afghanistan and Iraq.
The daily limit on asylum claims is in line with Austria's announcement last month that it would only take in 37,500 asylum seekers this year -- sharply down from the 90,000 it accepted in 2015, making it one of the bloc's highest recipients on a per-basis capita.
Vienna says that the measures are necessary because a German-backed EU plan for Turkey to stem the flow of migrants setting off from its coast is not yet working, and has urged other countries on the Balkans route into Europe to follow suit.
In response, Slovenia, Croatia and Serbia have also tightened their borders.
In 2015, over one million people reached Europe's shores -- nearly half of them Syrians fleeing a civil war that has claimed more than 260,000 lives.
The vast majority enter the EU through Italy and Greece, where they should register, but poor controls mean most are able to continue their journeys to northern Europe."

Hungary, which migrants and refugees use as a thoroughfare from the Balkans to northern Europe -- with a record 10,046 migrants arriving Wednesday from Croatia -- has taken the most hardline stance in Europe on the crisis.
It refuses to grant anyone asylum, and has sealed its border with Serbia with razor wire, prompting tens of thousands to divert their route through Croatia, from where they are bussed to the Hungarian frontier.
Budapest announced Thursday it was now considering closing its frontier with Croatia.
The move has triggered repeated criticism from Austria, which has been on the receiving end of the vast majority of migrants transiting through Hungary.
Austrian authorities said Thursday that 8,100 had entered from Hungary in the previous 36 hours.
Meanwhile, Reuters has reported that after Serbia banned Croatian cargo traffic from crossing its border, Croatia has in a tit-for-tat move blocked Serbian citizens and vehicles.
""Serbian passport holders and cars registered in Serbia cannot enter Croatia until further notice,"" a police officer said by telephone from Bajakovo, the main crossing point between the two ex-Yugoslav republics, according to Reuters."

Some 500 newly deployed troops will assist police in processing up to 6,000 refugees and migrants on a daily basis at the Spielfeld crossing in the southern state of Styria, police spokesman Fritz Grundnig told AFP on Tuesday.
In case of a spike in numbers, security forces could handle as many as 11,000 people -- roughly the average daily number of migrants who crossed into Austria late last year.
""Until now we've only been able to carry out random spot checks but this will allow us to ensure watertight controls of every single migrant,"" Grundnig said.
Initially the soldiers would only process ""several hundred migrants"" while the rest would be allowed to cross from Slovenia via Austria's other border crossing in Carinthia.
""But the idea is that eventually Spielfeld will be the only crossing point for migrants,"" Grundnig added.
The new measure comes just days before Austria is expected to complete the construction of a 3.7 kilometre mesh fence at Spielfeld.
The barrier -- which could be ready by Friday, according to Grundnig -- will be the first of its kind inside the EU's passport-free Schengen zone.
In a further sign of its hardening line, Austria has signalled that it would follow neighbouring Germany's lead and begin turning back any new arrivals seeking to claim asylum in Scandinavia.
Berlin's clampdown started after Sweden and Denmark tightened their borders in early January.
""If Germany rejects migrants who want to travel to Sweden, we will do the same,"" Austrian Chancellor Werner Faymann said on Sunday.
Austria, a small nation of 8.5 million people, has become a key transit country for hundreds of thousands of migrants and refugees entering the European Union.
Although most travel onwards, some 90,000 requested asylum in Austria in 2015.
The influx has sparked tensions within the ruling centrist coalition between Faymann's Social Democrats (SPÖ) and the conservative ÖVP party.
Although Faymann has noticeably sharpened his tone and called for ""tougher controls"" in recent weeks, he has so far resisted joining the ÖVP's demand to cap migrant numbers.

Mikl-Leitner said she wants to improve cooperation with Budapest to help secure its borders.
Hungary has refused to take back asylum seekers from other EU states and is threatening to build a fence along its border with Serbia to stem the flow of irregular migrants.
The European Commission has pledged to send financial aid and experts to Hungary to help it cope with a surge in illegal immigration this year, a senior Brussels official said in Budapest on Tuesday.
""Hungary will receive nearly €8 million ($9 million) of support to help it cope with the migration issue,"" said Dimitris Avramopoulos, the commission's senior official for migration issues, told journalists after a meeting with Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto.
Calling European Union member Hungary a ""frontline"" state like Italy and Greece, Avramopoulos said ""Europe will always support frontline member states"".
""Hungary is under pressure. We were talking so far about Italy and Greece, now we added Hungary,"" he noted.
Brussels also offered to send asylum experts and help set up temporary ""hot-spot"" tents to speed up identification and registration of migrants and processing of asylum requests, Avramopoulos said.
In the last two years, Hungary, also a member of Europe's passport-free Schengen zone, has become a major transit country for refugees and migrants attempting to reach wealthy Western countries like Austria and Germany by land rather than sea.
Prime Minister Viktor Orban complained last week in Brussels that Hungary was receiving little help from Brussels compared to Italy and Greece. ""Now more attention is being paid to Hungary,"" Avramopoulos said on Tuesday.
In 2014, Hungary received more asylum requests per capita than any other EU country apart from Sweden, up to nearly 43,000 from just 2,000 in 2012.
Most come from Syria, Afghanistan and Iraq, but also from Kosovo.
This year, more than 50,000 migrants tried to cross into Hungary via Serbia between January 1 and May 31 -- representing an 880 percent increase compared to the same period in 2014, according to the EU's Frontex border agency.
The surge has coincided with a series of controversial anti-immigration measures launched by Orban.
Earlier in June, his government unveiled plans to build a four-metre (13-foot) high fence on its border with Serbia to keep out migrants.
""We try to adopt a common European agenda, a common European policy on migration but member states are not deprived of the right to adopt their own policy on matters of defending borders,"" Avramopoulos said.

There were 90 minute traffic jams at Austria’s border with Germany over the weekend as a result of continuous border checks by police, introduced to try and control the movement of refugees and migrants.
In one section, a backlog of cars stretched back 14 kilometres on Saturday as motorists tried to make their way to Germany on Tyrol’s A12 road.
The route between the Austrian town of Kufstein and the southern German town of Kiefersfelden is popular with ski tourists and other holiday-makers in the region. Some motorists who tried to avoid the back-up caused by police checks by taking another route found themselves stuck as other roads in the region also came to a standstill.
It follows warnings a few weeks ago from tourism bosses in the region, who protested that the border controls will cause problems for holiday-makers to Tyrol and put them off coming.
Calls to end Italian Mediterranean route
Meanwhile, Austria’s Foreign Minister Sebastian Kurz called for further border controls on Sunday, saying that following the closure of the Balkan route for migrants, he now also wants to shut off the Italian Mediterranean route into Austria.
In an interview with the Sunday edition of Germany’s Bild newspaper, Kurz said: “We must do everything that we did for the Balkan route for the Italian-Mediterranean route so that it is clear the time of waving through refugees to central Europe has past, no matter which route it is.”
He also criticised the policy of other countries, adding: “We must stop state-organised transportation of every refugee who arrives to Greece to central Europe. We have fulfilled the wishes of the refugees, which was understandable from a human perspective. But we have also ensured that continuously more refugees make the journey. It was correct to put a stop to the Balkan route.”
Cardinal speaks out about Austrian policy
His comments follow those made by Austria’s Cardinal Christoph Schönborn, the Archbishop of Vienna, who said the move to close the Balkan route was “an act lacking European solidarity”.
He also added that he understands that Austria went ahead with Balkan partners to close the route by themselves but said he sees this is only be an “emergency measure”. “That cannot, however, be the last word”, he added.
The Cardinal, who himself grew up as a refugee in Austria after his family fled Bohemia in the Czech Republic after the Second World War, also praised Germany’s Chancellor Angela Merkel, describing her as a “brave and clever woman”.
He added: “And she is the person in Europe who says it the strongest and clearest that we must shoulder the problem together. I wish many European politicians had this clarity - including those in Austria who at one time stood fully behind Angela Merkel.”"

					11:20 CEST+02:00				", The Local,How could collapse of Turkey migrant deal affect Austria?,"With Turkey threatening to call off the controversial migrant deal made with the EU, thousands of asylum seekers and migrants could once again start making the dangerous crossing from Turkey to Greece, and thence to Austria.
The deal struck earlier this year involved Turkey accepting the return of ‘irregular’ migrants from Greece and preventing further people from leaving Turkish shores to reach Europe. For every person returned, the EU agreed to accept one Syrian asylum seeker from Turkey.
If Turkey met certain requirements, the EU also said it would allow visa-free travel in Europe for Turkish citizens for six months. Despite not meeting the requirements, Turkey says it wants this visa-free travel by October otherwise it will tear up the migrant deal.
With Austria one of the centres of the refugee and migrant crisis last year, how might the collapse of this deal affect the country were it to happen?
Struggle to control refugee numbers
If Turkey does cease efforts to prevent people leaving its borders and either crossing to the EU by land or sea, chances are that thousands of migrants and asylum seekers will attempt the journey. With the so-called West Balkan migration route closed off by strict border controls, it would be difficult for asylum seekers to travel this route to Austria as they did last summer. Tens of thousands may join those already stuck in Greece. But if border controls struggle to cope with the pressure, smugglers will take advantage of the situation and attempt to transport people into central Europe in the back of vans and trucks. This may well mean increased police controls at the Austrian border, traffic delays, more Austrian soldiers posted in foreign countries, and potentially many undocumented migrants and asylum seekers crossing the border.
Austrian shuts its borders to asylum seekers
Following the passing of a strict new asylum law in Austria earlier this year, the government now has the power to prevent nearly all asylum seekers from crossing the border in the case of an “emergency”. The Interior Ministry has said it would want to enact these measures if the number of asylum applications was approaching 37,500, the upper limit for 2016. If the situation in Greece and in countries bordering Austria becomes increasingly uncertain and conditions look similar to those last summer, however, then the government may decide the emergency measures are warranted to prevent the crisis from reaching Austria. This means a stronger police presence on the border and asylum seekers potentially being turned away at the border, breaking international human rights laws.
Austria swings to the right
At the first presidential run-off election in May, far-right candidate Norbert Hofer based much of his campaign on dissatisfaction with the government’s handling of the refugee and migrant crisis. With the election taking place just months after Austria saw chaos at its train stations and border towns - and amid a government u-turn on refugee policy - the issue was hotly debated in society. Since then, the number of new asylum seekers has significantly dropped - thanks in part to the Turkey deal - and the topic is no longer dominating newspaper headlines. With the election re-run taking place in October, it would be difficult for Hofer to continue campaigning on such a strong anti-migrant and anti-refugee mandate under these conditions. If the deal collapses, however, and the EU is seen to be failing at dealing with increasing numbers of asylum seekers, it would fuel the far-right and possibly give Hofer the edge over his liberal rival.
Collapse of political relations
Relations between Turkey and Europe are already strained and if Turkey did rip up the migrant deal, it would signal a significant breakdown in diplomacy between the two powers. This is in addition to EU anger at the authoritarian measures introduced by Turkey’s President and the increasing unlikeliness of Turkey getting the coveted EU membership. Austria is in particular sceptical of visa-free entry for Turkish citizens and strongly critical of the crackdown in Turkey. With hundreds of thousands of Erdogan supporters in Austria, however, a breakdown of relations between the two countries may lead to anger among the Turkish population and further protests in the streets. For the EU in general, having an uncertain and difficult relationship with the country that acts as a border buffer between Europe and conflicts in the Middle East, will not feel encouraging to many."

The three Bulgarians and one Afghan in custody over the 71 deaths are believed by police to be low-ranking members of one of the numerous human trafficking gangs that many of the tens of thousands migrants coming to Europe pay to help them.
""This is a human tragedy that requires a determined collective political response. It is a crisis of solidarity, not a crisis of numbers,"" Ban Ki-moon said Friday, expressing his horror at events in Austria and yet another Mediterranean shipwreck.
""I appeal to all governments involved to provide comprehensive responses, expand safe and legal channels of migration and act with humanity, compassion and in accordance with their international obligations.""
The truck, found Thursday on an Austrian motorway in the baking sun near
the Hungary border, contained the tightly packed, decomposing bodies of 59 men, eight women and four children including a little girl. They were thought to be Syrians.
The grisly discovery highlighted the dangers faced by people fleeing conflict and hardship in the Middle East and Africa even once they reach Europe, with many putting their fate in the hands of profit-hungry people smugglers.
It came as yet another boat crammed with desperate migrants sank in the Mediterranean off Libya. Seventy-six bodies were recovered but the United Nations said up to 200 people on two vessels were feared drowned.
The United Nations estimates 300,000 people have fled conflict and hardship in the Middle East and Africa for a better life in Europe this year, and 2,500 have died in the attempt, mostly in the Mediterranean.
""My little sister, someone climbed on her back and pushed her down. When I saw her for the last time, she was underwater with him on top of her,"" Pakistani Shefaz Hamza, 17, a survivor of the latest tragedy, told AFP in Libya.
""My mother and I spent nine hours in the water, holding on to a bit of wood. I kept telling her everything would be okay. But a quarter of an hour before the rescue team arrived, she passed away,"" he said.
Human trafficking
A court in the Hungarian town of Kecskemet, some 100 kilometres (60 miles) north of the Serbian border that some 140,000 have crossed this year, was due to rule on whether the four arrested men can remain in custody for further investigation.
They include the owner of the vehicle and two drivers, and were likely ""low-ranking members... of a Bulgarian-Hungarian human-trafficking gang"", said Hans Peter Doskozil, police chief in the Austrian state of Burgenland.
Austrian newspaper Kurier quoted a government official specialising in human trafficking as estimating that the people inside the lorry would have paid smugglers a total of around 700,000 euros ($785,000) for their entire journey.
The public prosecutor in Burgenland, Johann Fuchs, said he would likely seek to have the suspects extradited to Austria and that they could be tried for murder.
The discovery of the truck in Austria, a rare occurrence on land in a prosperous country when so many migrants have died at sea, provoked a wave of horror across Europe.
Austrian daily Oesterreich calculated Saturday that the 71 were crammed into 15 square metres (160 square feet) and would have asphyxiated in little over an hour once they were shut inside with no air, the children suffocating first.
Austrian motorway maintenance workers alerted police after noticing ""decomposing body fluids"" dripping from the truck, Doskozil said.
The police were confronted by an overpowering stench and a mass of tangled limbs, and forensics experts worked all night to clear out the vehicle. TV images showed flies buzzing around the back of the vehicle.
'We don't know where to go'
""If the stink from our car parks gets stronger perhaps we will finally understand, not just in Austria... that it is time to create safe routes to Europe, fast registration and a swift and a fair sharing out (of migrants),"" said Amnesty International's Austrian chief Heinz Patzelt.
In Germany, where Chancellor Angela Merkel was booed this week by far-right protestors, a demonstration to show solidarity with refugees was planned in Dresden on Saturday.
Austrian Chancellor Werner Faymann and French President Francois Hollande called during a phone call for a ""unified European system of asylum and a common migration policy"".
The victims in Austria were likely among the more than 100,000 people to have trekked up through the western Balkans into EU member Hungary this year.
From Hungary, which is laying a barbed-wire barrier along its border with Serbia to try to keep migrants out, many attempt to make it to richer nations like Germany and Sweden.
On Friday, Hungary's government proposed stiffer penalties for border jumpers and people smugglers, including a three-year jail term for those caught breaching the new fence.

Huge traffic jams stretching back 50 kilometres (30 miles) built up along the Austro-Hungarian border on Monday as Austrian police stepped up security checks in the hunt for people smugglers.
The measure was put in place on Sunday, three days after an abandoned lorry containing 71 dead migrants, four of them children, was discovered on a motorway near the Hungarian border.
Since the operation began at 1830 GMT, more than 200 migrants have been picked up, and another five people have detained on suspicion of smuggling, officials said.
""The main aim is to target smuggling gangs. What is happening here are controls conducted by traffic police and security forces -- these are not border controls,"" said police spokesman Helmut Marban.
140,000 migrants arriving via Serbia
As part of the clampdown, carried out in close collaboration with the Hungarian, Slovakian and German authorities, police are stopping trucks, vans and cars in an effort to catch those trying to make money from people fleeing war and persecution.
Shortly after the checks began, officers discovered 12 migrants -- nine adults and three children -- crammed inside a minivan carrying a French number plate.
The group was believed to be predominantly from Syria, media reports said.
The driver, whose nationality was not immediately clear, was arrested, the Austrian authorities said.
The new security checks caused a huge build up of traffic overnight, and by early Monday, there were tailbacks of up to 30 kilometres along the main motorway connecting Budapest to Vienna.
Around noon, there were 50-kilometre queues near the Austrian border town of Nickelsdorf, according to local mayor Gerhard Zapfl.
Many migrants picked up in Austria have already trekked on foot through four or five countries before they reach EU member Hungary, where smugglers pack them into vehicles without food or water, promising to transport them to richer European states like Germany or Sweden.
So far this year, the Hungarian government has reported more than 140,000 migrants entering the country from Serbia.
93 traffickers arrested in Upper Austria
Since Hungary is in the visa-free Schengen zone, onwards travel has been relatively easy.
But Austria's reinforced border units and its tightened security checks are likely to make the process of entering the country illegally much harder.
This year alone, police in Upper Austria have arrested 93 human traffickers transporting a total of 1,630 migrants.
Hungarian police said on Sunday that a fifth suspected human trafficker had been arrested over Thursday's gruesome discovery of the 71 decomposing corpses.
Pressure to take their fair share
Austria's Interior Minister Johanna Mikl-Leitner on Monday proposed cutting EU funding for member states that don't take in their fair share of migrants.
""You can't just cherry-pick within the European community,"" she said of countries which have resisted accepting many asylum-seekers as the European Union struggles to absorb its biggest influx of migrants and refugees since World War II.
One way to put pressure on those states which don't take their fair share, would be ""scrapping or cutting financial support"", Mikl-Leitner told German public broadcaster ZDF.
""Either Europe fails because of the refugee issue"" or it will emerge stronger through a ""fair"" distribution of refugees, she said.
Austria has tightened controls on motorways near the Hungarian border, where an abandoned lorry was found last week containing 71 dead migrants, four of them children.
The minister said that building a fence, as Hungary is doing on its border with Serbia, was no solution, and the idea that such a move would discourage refugees was an ""illusion"".
Germany -- which expects to receive 800,000 asylum seekers this year, four times more than in 2014 and more than any other EU country -- has called for a fairer distribution of refugees between EU countries.
Thousands catch trains to Vienna, Munich and Berlin
Several hundred migrants stuck for days in makeshift refugee camps at train stations in Budapest were on Monday allowed to board trains headed for Austria and Germany, an AFP correspondent at the scene said.
Hungarian police had previously prevented as many as 2,000 migrants from leaving the station because they had no legal papers.
But on Monday there were no security forces present as the refugees, many from Syria, rushed to get on trains leaving for Vienna, Munich and Berlin.
People were running along the platform to catch an Austria-bound train scheduled to leave at 1110 GMT, with some helping to lift a woman in a wheelchair into a carriage.
There were confusing scenes as a Hungarian railway employee initially refused to allow the train to leave, saying it was packed beyond capacity and some people did not have valid tickets.
But the train eventually departed with a 20-minute delay.
However, an Austrian police officer at the station told AFP the migrants would be stopped once they crossed into Austria."

Austria's deficit was 2.7 percent of GDP last year, just shy of the eurozone's 3.0 percent deficit target.

The Commission has said it accepts the migrant crisis amounts to exceptional circumstances, justifying a softening of deficit rules.

Merkel: Warning
The ""horrible"" discovery Thursday of between 20 and 50 dead migrants on a truck in Austria is a warning to Europe to get to grips with the migrant crisis, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said.
""We were all shaken by the horrible news that up to 50 people died... although these were people coming to seek safety,"" Merkel said in Vienna.
""This is a warning to work to resolve this problem and show solidarity"".
Western Balkan countries are facing ""huge challenges"" handling tens of thousands of migrants trying to get to the EU, she added.
""It is our responsibility to help them.""
Channel 4 reporter Lindsey Hilsum tweeted this image Thursday morning.
Parked since Wednesday
It is thought that the truck had been parked in the area since Wednesday.
""We cannot confirm yet how they died,"" Doskozil added.
Forensics teams at the scene said it would take several days to secure evidence.
The minister announced Austria would tighten its border controls and intensify checks on international trains in the coming weeks.
She also called on the other 27 member states of the European Union to show ""zero tolerance"" for people smugglers.
Gruesome Find
The gruesome find comes as German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Balkan leaders are meeting in Vienna to seek how to tackle together the biggest migration crisis to hit Europe since World War II.
They reacted with shock to the news of the dead migrants.
""Just another terrible incident, illustrating the urgent need for quick and determined common action,"" tweeted the EU's commissioner for enlargement, Johannes Hahn.

This year has seen record numbers of people trying to reach the EU by sea and land as they flee conflicts in Africa, Asia and the Middle East.
In Austria, the number of asylum requests rose above 28,300 between January and June alone -- as many as for the whole of 2014 -- and officials expect the total to reach 80,000 this year.
Ahead of the conference, Austria's Foreign Minister Sebastian Kurz warned that his country would consider introducing tougher anti-migration measures including ""much tighter border controls"", if the EU failed to come up with a unified response.
""Austria has more migrants than Italy and Greece combined... so we shouldn't pretend that only Italy and Greece are affected,"" he said in an interview with public broadcaster ORF.
Hungary to investigate
Hungary said it would join the investigation into the discovery Thursday of between 20 and 50 dead migrants on a truck in Austria after it emerged the vehicle had Hungarian number plates.
""Austrian and Hungarian police will work closely together to take the necessary steps to investigate what happened and apprehend those responsible,"" Prime Minister Viktor Orban's spokesman Janos Lazar said, adding that Hungary had been informed by Austrian police that the driver was Romanian.
""It appears that the victims were illegal migrants in a human trafficking operation."""

finally get to grips with its ever-deadlier migrant crisis after Austria's horrific truck tragedy, as people continued to pour into Hungary from Serbia despite a newly completed razor-wire barrier.
Hungarian police said a fifth suspected human trafficker -- a fourth Bulgarian -- had been arrested over Thursday's gruesome discovery of 71 decomposing corpses in an abandoned truck on an Austrian motorway.
The truck tragedy, plus yet another Mediterranean shipwreck claiming at least 111 lives, have served as chilling reminders of Europe's failure to cope with the influx of hundreds of thousands of migrants.
The United Nations estimates 300,000 people have fled conflict and hardship in the Middle East and Africa for a better life in Europe this year alone. Millions more sit in camps in Turkey, Jordan and Lebanon.
Some 2,500 have died in the treacherous journey, most drowning in the waters of the Mediterranean after being crammed into unseaworthy boats.
European Union home affairs ministers are to hold emergency talks on September 14 in Brussels to try and ""strengthen the European response,"" the government of Luxembourg, which holds the rotating EU presidency, announced Sunday.
""Europe needs to stop being moved and start moving,"" Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi said, calling again for a fairer distribution of migrants among the European Union's 28 members.
French Prime Minister Manuel Valls said that people ""fleeing war, persecution, torture, oppression, must be welcomed"" and should be treated with ""dignity"".
And French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius slammed as ""scandalous"" the attitude of certain EU members in eastern Europe in refusing to accept more migrants.
Pope Francis meanwhile called for ""effective cooperation"" against ""crimes that are an offence to the whole of humanity.""
'Peace be with you'
The migrants crossing the Mediterranean head either for Italy -- where another 513 arrived on Sunday, adding to some 108,000 this year -- or Greece, which many also reach overland via Turkey.
Lots then try to come north, in the case of Greece trekking up through the western Balkans -- Macedonia called a state of emergency two weeks ago -- bound for EU member Hungary.
The journey is exhausting -- and expensive.
""We can't afford this at all, and every step of the way we have to pay,"" Samar, a 40-year-old from Damascus, told AFP as she waited in the sun for hours at a filthy reception camp in Presevo, Serbia.
""We are in a labyrinth, going from queue to queue, and here in Serbia, the police are shouting at us like we are animals,"" the mother of two teenage boys said, tears welling in her eyes.
Hungary, which this month has recorded 50,000 new arrivals, has responded by completing on Saturday a barrier of three rolls of NATO-standard razor wire along the entire 175-kilometre (110-mile) border with Serbia, patrolled by border police with dogs and 4x4s.
Right-wing Prime Minister Viktor Orban's government is also building a four-metre-high fence and wants to stiffen penalties for people entering illegally.
Fabius said Sunday that the barrier ""did not respect Europe's common values"".
It is not proving much use in any case, with police saying Sunday that 3,080 migrants crossed over on Saturday, the second-highest daily total.
On Sunday AFP witnessed a group of around 200 migrants passing through carrying plastic bags, rucksacks and bottles of water. They called out a greeting, ""salam alaikum"" -- ""peace be with you"" in Arabic.
New arrest
The five people now in custody in Hungary over the Austrian lorry are believed by police to be low-ranking members of one of the numerous and often unscrupulous human-trafficking gangs that extract exorbitant amounts of money to transport migrants.
The three Bulgarians and one Afghan already in detention on Saturday said they were innocent as a court in Hungary remanded them in custody until September 29.
The 7.5-tonne truck with Hungarian number plates found in Austria contained the decomposing bodies of 59 men, eight women, a toddler and three young boys, provoking international revulsion.
The dead were thought to be Syrians and police believe they suffocated and had been dead for up to two days before the truck was discovered by motorway maintenance workers due to decomposing body fluids dripping from the vehicle.
Hungarian news portal Index.hu on Sunday quoted the Hungarian driver of another vehicle as saying that he saw the driver of the truck running away from the back doors in panic and being picked up in a car that then sped off.
On Sunday Austrian police said that three Syrian children rescued with severe dehydration on Friday from a van packed with migrants were taken out of hospital by their parents and ""vanished"", most likely to Germany.
""The van was driven by a Romanian and had Spanish number plates and arrived from Hungary,"" spokesman David Furtner told AFP. ""This year we have arrested 93 people traffickers in Upper Austria state alone. Most escape though.""
The Austrian government on Sunday announced on Sunday it was ""massively stepping up"" checks at the Hungarian border."

Hungary has said that it is overburdened by illegal immigration - more than 60,000 people have entered the country illegally this year, according to government officials.
Many try to continue on to other European states but under the EU's Dublin Regulation those countries can return asylum seekers to Hungary to have their application processed there.
Just days ago Hungary announced it would erect a border fence against migrants.

					11:37 CET+01:00				", The Local,Austrian MPs approve tough new migrant bill,"Austrian government ministers have approved new legislation which will reform asylum seekers’ rights, including delaying family reunification.
Having taken in 90,000 asylum seekers last year, the governing coalition has said it is time to toughen up Austria’s liberal admissions policies and make it a less attractive destination for asylum seekers.
The bill stipulates that once granted asylum, a refugee’s situation should be examined after three years to determine if they are still at risk in their homeland, and if they are not they could then be deported.
However, if the refugee in question is well integrated in Austria and there are humanitarian reasons why they should not be sent home, then deportation is unlikely.
Sources at the interior ministry have said that refugees who have taken language and Austrian values courses are less likely to be deported, but that each case will be decided on an individual basis.
The new bill will also increase the waiting period before which refugees can apply to bring over family members. Those who have been granted subsidiary protection will have to wait three years, rather than one. And war refugees from countries like Syria who are granted asylum will have to apply within three months of being granted asylum status, if they want family members to be able to join them. They will also have to prove that they have enough money to be able to support their family.
The new rules will affect all refugees who applied for asylum after November 15th 2015, as well those who are still waiting for a decision to be made on their status.
The Caritas charity has criticised the new law, saying it will add to human suffering and make it even harder for refugees to integrate.
Denmark is expected to vote on Tuesday on similar reforms intended to stem the flow of refugees through its borders. International outrage has focussed on a proposal allowing police to seize cash and valuables from refugees to help pay for their stay in asylum centres."

the number of migrants allowed to enter the country, ahead of tougher measures
set to be announced by neighbouring Austria later this week to slow down the
influx.
The two EU member states, which also belong to the passport-free Schengen zone, have become key transit nations for migrants and refugees trekking up through the Balkans to reach western Europe.
Austria, which has hardened its stance in recent weeks, will in the coming days announce a daily cap on the number of migrants allowed to enter the country via its main border crossing with Slovenia.
The country of nearly nine million people last year received 90,000 asylum claims, one of the bloc's highest rates per capita.
In anticipation of Vienna's move, the Slovenian interior ministry said it would also begin limiting the arrivals to avoid becoming a bottleneck.
State TV reported the tougher controls would start Monday morning and see the number of people allowed to cross the Sentilj checkpoint into Austria restricted to 1,000 per day.
Slovenia said in a statement released by its interior ministry it had informed neighbouring Croatia, the next country along the migrant trail, of its decision to bring in tougher border controls.
Hermann Muhr, the spokesman for Austria's Interior Minister Johanna Mikl-Leitner, confirmed to AFP Sunday that ""a series of tougher measures will be announced in the course of this week including a daily quota of migrants, in line with what Germany is already doing"".
Last month, Vienna already warned it would cap this year's number of asylum claims at 37,500 and deport at least 12,500 people.
The continent is grappling with its worst migrant crisis since World War II, which shows no sign of abating.
In 2015, over a million people reached Europe's shores -- nearly half of them Syrians fleeing a civil war that has killed more than a quarter of a million people.
Germany has been the main destination for most of the migrants once they land in Greece or other points in Europe.
Austria, along with the so-called ""Visegrad Four"" group -- Hungary, Poland, Slovakia and the Czech Republic -- is accusing Athens of failing to protect the EU's external borders.
The Visegrad Four will meet leaders from Macedonia and Bulgaria, which both share a border with Greece, in Prague on Monday to discuss reinforcing border controls."

Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi last week insisted Italy was not facing an ""invasion"" after a spike in migrant boat crossings from Libya exacerbated fears it could become the main entry point into Europe.
But Kurz highlighted Austria's deep concerns as Europe struggles to contain the worst migrant crisis the continent has known since World War II.
""Look at the figures. Austria received 90,000 migrants last year, close on one percent of the population - in terms of Italy's population that would amount to more than 600,000 people,"" Kurz told Italian daily Il Messaggero.
He noted that 154,000 migrants had arrived in Italy across 2015 but had ""only"" registered 83,000 asylum claims - a discrepancy of 71,000.
Austria, seeking to cut this year's arrivals to 37,500, sparked consternation in Rome last week over preliminary construction work at Brenner Pass in the Alps to prepare for a possible new influx of migrants coming north from Italy.
The Brenner Pass is one of the main transport corridors between northern and southern Europe.
The European Union also last week echoed Italian concern, with European Commission spokeswoman Natasha Bertaud saying the issue would need to be discussed with Austrian Interior Minister Johanna Mikl-Leitner given the Pass is ""essential for freedom of movement within the European Union.""
Vienna worries that the closure earlier this year of the Balkan trail from Greece towards Austria means a new route across the sea from Libya to Italy and then northwards will open up.
More controls?
Switzerland revealed its own concern at the crisis, saying it was ready to mobilise up to 2,000 soldiers should migrants continue to arrive.
Swiss federal authorities said they have drawn up separate scenarios ranging from 10,000 arrivals inside a month to a worst case of 30,000 inside a few days.
The latter ""would necessitate army intervention,"" the government said.
In a statement the government said it had tasked the defence ministry with putting 2,000 troops on standby for such an eventuality.
The ministry last week said that given the current shifting state of migratory routes ""Switzerland could be faced in the coming weeks or months by an influx of people seeking protection.""
Earlier this week, Italy's Coldiretti agricultural union said the reintroduction of border controls would threaten the movement €10 billion ($11.3 billion) worth of Italian foodstuffs which transit the tunnel annually.
""We are aware of the historic and logistical importance of this border and we ourselves do not wish to see controls,"" Kurz said.
""But if we find the number of clandestine migrants arriving via the Mediterranean does not drop considerably then we would be forced to introduce controls at Brenner,"" he warned."

With the support of Europol and Eurojust and nearly 400 law enforcement officers, a total of 77 people were arrested, according to a Europol press release.
The gang members came from Kosovo, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Serbia, Bosnia Herzegovina and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.
The Kosovan migrants typically travelled to Serbia on their own where they made contact with facilitators, who then smuggled them into Hungary.
Upon their arrival in Hungary, the migrants were handled by another cell of the same criminal network. In many cases, the migrants claimed asylum in Hungary before being smuggled onwards to their final destinations in Switzerland, Italy, Germany and France.
For their journeys across Europe, migrants were smuggled in vehicles travelling through Slovakia, the Czech Republic, Germany and Austria. The migrants paid the smugglers using Western Union or MoneyGram transfers as well as cash.
The facilitators charged around €2,800 per person or €7,000 for a whole family to organise a trip from Kosovo to France.
In addition to the arrests of 46 people on Tuesday (eight of those were in Austria), previous operations with links to the current investigation resulted in a further 31 arrests of members of the same organised criminal network.
Police confiscated several vehicles, mobile phones, SIM cards, computers, hard drives, forged travel documents, and more than €52,000 in cash.
Kosovo has high unemployment, chronic poverty and the youngest population in Europe. Tens of thousands of Kosovans have left since the start of the year - many enduring illegal border crossings to make their way into wealthier EU countries.
Austria has said it will not accept any asylum applications from Kosovans, as their country is now considered safe. Instead, they will be quickly repatriated.
According to Austria’s Interior Ministry, this year alone 1,800 Kosovars have applied for asylum in Austria, compared with 1,900 for the whole of 2014. The figures are even higher for Hungary, where some 11,000 registered for asylum in January."

Austrian Interior Minister Wolfgang Sobotka, who has vigorously defended the controversial package which was driven by a surge of the far right, was due in Rome to explain his government's plans to Italian counterpart Angelo Alfano.
Prime Minister Matteo Renzi has warned that closing the famous Brenner Pass in the Alps would be a ""flagrant breach of European rules"" and is pushing the European Commission to force Austria to hold off on a move that many fear could come to symbolise the death of Europe's Schengen system of open borders.
But the Vienna government is under intense domestic pressure to stem the volume of asylum seekers and other migrants arriving on its soil with the far-right surging in polls.
UN chief Ban Ki-moon hit out Thursday at what he called ""increasingly restrictive"" refugee policies in Europe, saying he was ""alarmed by the growing xenophobia here"" and elsewhere in Europe, in a speech to the Austrian parliament.
Wedged between the Italian and Balkan routes to northern Europe, Austria received 90,000 asylum requests last year, the second highest in per capita terms of any EU country.
'Whole world's burden'
Legislation approved Wednesday by the Austrian parliament enables the government to respond to spikes in migrant arrivals by declaring a state of emergency which provides for asylum seekers to be turned away at border points.
""We cannot shoulder the whole world's burden,"" Sobotka said Wednesday in defence of a law denounced by rights groups as a betrayal of Austria's history as a place of refuge, most notably for dissidents fleeing the old Soviet bloc.
Some 250 police have been deployed at the Brenner Pass and preparations are under way for the construction of a 370-metre (yard) barrier which would be up to four metres (13 foot) high in places, that is due for completion by the end of May.
""Brenner: Vienna's slap in the face,"" was the headline in La Stampa daily, in a reflection of the outraged tone of virtually all the coverage.
The pass is a major transport link between southern and northern Europe with an average of 2,500 lorries and 15,000 cars using it every day.
Austria is preparing for a potential closure of the pass as fears grow that migrant arrivals in Italy could spike this summer as a result of the effective closure of the Balkan route into Europe.
Italy insists there is no evidence of that happening and that it is taking steps to prevent it if it does.
Rome also maintains that the numbers of migrants refused asylum in Austria and returning to Italy is rising.
According to the interior ministry, 2,051 people -- mainly from Pakistan and Afghanistan -- returned to Italy in the first four months of this year, compared with 3,143 for the whole of 2015.
Rome this week unveiled plans to fingerprint migrants crossing the Mediterranean as soon as they are picked up by rescue boats.
Fears of arrival spike
There have long been tensions with other EU countries over migrants arriving in Italy and traveling north without being registered.
If they are not registered, countries like Austria and France and popular destination states like Germany and Sweden do not have the option of sending them back to Italy.
Under the EU's much-criticised Dublin Regulation, asylum claims must be processed by the first country in which refugees arrive.
Italy was warned last year by the European Commission that it must make its registration procedures more efficient.
But Italian officials say the country cannot cope alone with the migrant influx.
More than 350,000 people from all over the world have reached Italy on boats from Libya since the start of 2014, as Europe battles its biggest migration crisis since World War II.
Fears of a spike in arrivals have given added urgency to attempts to find a lasting solution to the crisis and Italy is pushing a plan to introduce NATO naval patrols off Libya in time for the summer -- peak season for people smuggling.
Modeled on an existing NATO operation in waters between Turkey and Greece, the plan has been backed by US President Barack Obama and is expected to be approved by alliance leaders at a summit in Warsaw in July.
Italy has also proposed an EU-funded scheme to offer African countries cash to cooperate with the fast-track repatriation of migrants deemed to have no claim to asylum in Europe."

In the wake of the disaster EU countries have approved boosting maritime and border patrols in the Mediterranean, targeting people smugglers and working with migrants' home countries and the nations they travel through to try to dissuade people from making the perilous journey across the sea.

""It is a standby police troop that if need be can secure a border crossing point and carry out identity checks. Just waving people through won't happen again,"" he added.
Hundreds of thousands of migrants passed through Austria on their way to Germany and elsewhere at the height of Europe's migrant crisis in 2015, and Austria received a record number of asylum claims.
Kickl's party stoked concerns about the influx and came third in elections last October.
Last month the FPÖ became junior coalition partner to the conservatives of Chancellor Sebastian Kurz.
The last time the FPÖ entered government, in 2000, there was an outcry elsewhere but this time the reaction has been much more muted, partly due to the rise of other anti-immigration parties elsewhere.
The FPÖ has also toned down its criticism of the European Union and the new government's coalition agreement rules out a Brexit-style referendum on Austrian membership of the bloc.
The party's new general secretary Harald Vilimsky, an MEP, said though that the FPÖ will remain in the same European Parliament bloc as the more eurosceptic French National Front of Marine Le Pen.
""We agreed in our talks with Kurz that international alliances are not an issue,"" Vilimsky, 51, told Der Standard daily in an interview to be published on Friday.
He added however that alliances may change following European elections and Britain's scheduled departure from the bloc in 2019."

On Sunday, a group of cars driven by German and Austrian activists travelled to the Hungarian border to pick up refugees and distribute food and blankets.
The refugees had travelled north through the Balkans before arriving at Hungary's southern border, and on to Austria and Germany. The majority are fleeing the civil war in Syria.
Just over 100 people claimed asylum in Austria over the weekend, with more than 18,000 travelling on to Germany to claim asylum there. The refugees are afraid that if they claim asylum in Austria they could be sent back to Hungary under the Dublin III rule - whereas Germany has said it will accept asylum applications from Syrian refugees, regardless of which EU country they first arrived in.
The new arrivals in Austria have been met at the main railway stations - Westbahnhof and Hauptbahnhof - by a huge army of charity workers and volunteers who are handing out food, water, hygiene supplies and providing medical treatment.
Germany is expecting a record 800,000 new asylum seekers this year, four times the number in 2014.
The UN's refugee chief has said the crisis could be ""manageable"" if European countries all pulled their weight and agreed on a common approach.
European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker is expected to present a plan on Wednesday to relocate 120,000 refugees from overstretched Italy, Greece and Hungary.
Germany's Welt am Sonntag newspaper said the plan would see Germany accepting 31,000, followed by France with 24,000 and Spain with almost 15,000. Austria has said it will take an extra 3,640 refugees.
EU interior ministers are meeting on September 14th, and Austria is among those pushing for a summit to resolve the migrant crisis to be held swiftly afterwards.

					09:22 CET+01:00				",The Local/AFP,Humanitarian fears hang over Balkans migrant talks,"Austria is hosting talks on Wednesday with countries along the well-trodden migrant path through the western Balkans to northern Europe, as tighter border controls raise fears of a humanitarian crisis, particularly in Greece.
But Athens has angrily protested at being excluded from the ministerial meeting in Vienna, underscoring the rifts in Europe over how to tackle the crisis.
The talks come after figures showed that Europe's migrant headache was continuing to rage, with over 110,000 people arriving in Greece and Italy so far this year alone, following more than one million in 2015.
According to the International Organization for Migration, 31,000 of this year's arrivals were fleeing the Syrian civil war. A total of 413 people lost their lives on the journey, including 321 on the way to Greece.
The influx has fuelled unease in Europe, boosted populist parties, driven a wedge among many of the 28 members of the European Union and thrown into doubt the continent's cherished passport-free Schengen Zone that is crucial for commerce.
Amnesty International has criticised Europe's ""shameful"" response, saying most EU countries had ""simply decided that the protection of their borders is more important than the protection of the rights of refugees"".
So far joint EU efforts to halt the influx, including a deal with Turkey to stem the mass exodus of migrants across the sea to Greece, have failed to bear fruit.
As a result, countries throughout the western Balkans have begun unilaterally to impose restrictions, sparked by Austria's much-criticised introduction last week of daily migrant limits.
Interior Minister Johanna Mikl-Leiter said as she opened the Vienna meeting that in the absence of a functioning EU strategy, the talks would discuss ways ""to stop the migrant influx through the Balkans"".
""We believe in European measures and we are working on them. But while we wait we have to take national measures,"" she said.
In the latest such move, Macedonia has closed its frontier to Afghans and introduced more stringent document checks for Syrians and Iraqis seeking to travel to northern and western Europe.
The move caused a bottleneck at the Greek-Macedonian border -- where nearly 4,000 people were waiting to get through on Tuesday -- and forced Greek police to keep hundreds of others from travelling to the frontier.
On the Greek side, Afghan families boarded nearly a dozen buses for the long trip back to the capital, where they will be temporarily housed in relocation camps, police said.
Skopje said its move followed decisions by countries further up the western Balkan migrant route to turn back groups of Afghans, while Serbia announced a similar stance.
""There is no sense in expecting Serbia to agree to receive migrants about whom we receive clear signals from Austria, Slovenia and Croatia that they will not be allowed in these countries,"" Serbian Interior Minister Nebojsa Stefanovic said.
'Chaos and confusion'
EU migration commissioner Dimitris Avramopoulos and Dutch Migration Minister Klaas Dijkhoff said they were ""concerned"" by developments in the Balkans and by the ""humanitarian crisis that might unfold"".
Their fears were echoed by Filippo Grandi, the new head of the UN refugee agency UNHCR on a visit Tuesday to the Greek island of Lesbos, a main landing point after the perilous sea crossing for migrants from Turkey.
""I am very worried about the news that we are getting about increasing closures of European borders along the Balkans route because that will create further chaos and confusion,"" Grandi said.
Cash-strapped Greece, struggling to cope as the main entry point for migrants into the EU, was however not invited to the Vienna meeting of ministers from Albania, Bosnia, Bulgaria, Croatia, Kosovo, Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia and Slovenia.
""Through this one-sided and not at all friendly move towards our country, there is an attempt to take decisions in Greece's absence that directly affect Greece and Greek borders,"" the Greek foreign ministry complained.
Austria, which controversially last week imposed a daily limit of 80 asylum claims, retorted that it was a ""fixed"" meeting format and its summary would be available to EU interior and justice ministers when they meet on Thursday in Brussels.
Austria's Foreign Minister said that Greece ""is not prepared at present to reduce the influx... On the contrary it wants to continue waving them through""."

""We don't have to take criticism from anyone on any side,"" Interior Minister Johanna Mikl-Leitner told the Austria Press Agency.
""Apparently for some the European solution (to the crisis) is for all (the migrants) to mass in Austria,"" she said.
Austria, which took in 90,000 asylum-seekers in 2015 and saw almost ten times as many pass through, imposed on February 19th a cap of 80 asylum claims per day and of 3,200 migrants allowed to transit.
At a meeting in Vienna last week, it persuaded nine countries along the well-trodden path for migrants from Greece through the western Balkans towards Austria and beyond to impose tighter controls too.
Neither Greece, where thousands of migrants have become stuck as a result, nor Germany were invited to the talks, underscoring the deep rifts within the EU as it faces the biggest influx of migrants since 1945.
Germany in particular has criticised the limit on the number allowed to pass through Austria as being too high, but Mikl-Leitner said that Germany itself had imposed daily caps in December, leading to ""huge backlogs"" in Austria.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Sunday she found Austria's ""unilateral"" decision ""a little unfortunate"" and described how it derailed a timetable for a series of EU measures and meetings to tackle the migrant crisis.
She said Vienna's move came just before a February 18th EU summit and led her to insist that leaders move forward their next Brussels debate on the issue from a regular March 18th summit to next on March 7th.
""If Austria had not taken this decision, we could have waited until our regular March 18th Council,"" she said, allowing time to see results from several measures, such as a NATO surveillance mission in the Aegean Sea to stop refugee boats.
Austria says that its measures and those of Balkan countries, which are only allowing 580 migrants to enter per day, are necessary because efforts towards a common EU policy have failed so far.
Relations between Austria and Greece have soured dramatically, with Athens withdrawing its ambassador and Austria's Chancellor Werner Faymann on Sunday accusing Greece of ""behaving like a travel agency"" for migrants.
EU president Donald Tusk will meet Faymann in Vienna on Tuesday as part of a visit to several Balkan countries in a bid to heal the deep divisions over how to tame the migrant crisis."

was at stake as it pressed Balkan states, in the absence of an effective
common response by the bloc, to reduce the influx of migrants despite fears of
a humanitarian crisis.
Further undermining the European Union's hopes to get a grip on the situation, Hungary meanwhile announced a referendum on Brussels' troubled scheme to share out migrants among the 28-nation group via mandatory quotas.
""We have to reduce the influx now. This is a question of survival for the EU,"" Austrian Interior Minister Johanna Mikl-Leitner said after talks in Vienna with countries on the well-trodden west Balkans route north from Greece.
Greece, where thousands of Afghans have been held up at the border with Macedonia, angrily protested at being excluded from the ministerial meeting, underscoring the deep rifts within the EU.
'Warehouse of souls'
""Greece will no longer agree to any deal if the burdens and responsibilities are not shared proportionally,"" Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras told the Greek parliament, vowing ""We will not allow our country to turn into a warehouse of souls.""
A joint statement from the participants said that after hundreds of thousands of people trekked through the Balkans last year, many ending up in Germany, Sweden and also Austria, the inflow must be ""massively reduced"".
The talks come after figures showed over 110,000 people arriving in Greece and Italy so far this year alone -- 413 perishing in the attempt -- following more than one million arrivals in 2015.
Amnesty International hit out Wednesday at Europe's ""shameful"" response, saying most EU countries had ""simply decided that the protection of their borders is more important than the protection of the rights of refugees"".
Vienna has come under fire for organising Wednesday's talks, not least from Greece, and for imposing last week daily limits on the number of migrants who can apply for asylum in Austria or transit to other countries.
But despite sharp criticism also from Germany, Vienna says that it has no choice because the EU has failed to get off the ground any effective common strategy.
""I am optimistic that we can reach a joint EU response. The question is when,"" Mikl-Leitner told a news conference. ""We want to generate pressure so that the EU can reach a solution.""
So far joint EU efforts to halt the influx, including a deal with Turkey -- the subject of a March 7 special summit -- to stem the mass exodus of migrants across the sea to Greece, have failed to bear fruit.
An EU scheme agreed in September to relocate 160,000 people among EU nations under mandatory quotas, has seen just 598 relocated so far, with former communist members of the bloc opposing the plan and filing legal challenges.
Hungarian Premier Viktor Orban, announcing on Wednesday plans for the so-far undated referendum, said that Brussels has no right to ""redraw Europe's cultural and religious identity.""
Unilateral
As a result of the EU's failures, countries throughout the western Balkans have begun unilaterally to impose restrictions, sparked by Austria's much-criticised daily migrant limits.
Macedonia has closed its frontier to Afghans and introduced more stringent document checks for Syrians and Iraqis seeking to travel to northern and western Europe.
""We did not take a unilateral decision,"" Macedonia's Foreign Minister Nikola Poposki told Germany's Bild daily in an interview published Wednesday.
""We reacted because of the actions of other countries.""
As a result on Wednesday, around 3,000 people were waiting at the Idomeni crossing point between Greece and Macedonia, police said, with the Macedonians allowing 860 people through overnight.
Greek authorities were attempting to take hundreds by bus back to Athens, but were being hindered by a blockade of motorways by farmers protesting for weeks about tax and pension reforms.
Yiannis Mouzalas, Greece's minister responsible for migration, said that there were currently some 12,000 migrants stuck in the country, with hundreds more arriving every day.
'Chaos and confusion'
EU migration commissioner Dimitris Avramopoulos and Dutch Migration Minister Klaas Dijkhoff said Tuesday they were ""concerned"" by the developments and by the ""humanitarian crisis that might unfold"".
Their fears were echoed on Wednesday by Filippo Grandi, the new head of the UN refugee agency UNHCR, during a visit to Greece.
""By closing the borders to people that are asking for help and protection, first of all we do not fulfill our obligations, the obligations that Europe has enshrined in its own legislation and principles,"" Grandi said in Athens.
""The response is not closures, it is cooperation. It is cooperation between countries. Everybody has to take a share of this burden,"" he added.
Austrian officials said that the conclusions of the talks would be presented to a meeting of EU interior and justice ministers on Thursday in Brussels."

This is part of a package of EU-wide measures which are being put together at a conference in Sarajevo, at which Austria’s Interior Minister Johanna Mikl-Leitner is a keynote speaker.
The idea for the information folder comes from an Austrian initiative which was conceived for migrants arriving from the West Balkans in 2010. It stresses the values of tolerance and inclusion.
""For example, perhaps a father intends to send his son, but not his daughter, to kindergarten,"" Mikl-Leitner said.
""It’s not acceptable that some migrant men would fail to respect a policewoman because she is a woman. Religion cannot supersede state laws and become used for radicalization,"" she added.
The folders, which will be ready in a few weeks time, will also contain information aimed at Muslim women - informing them that they should wear the headscarf if they choose to, but not because they have been ordered to by a family patriarch. It will also stress that girls have an equal right to further education.
The European Council is due to adopt a package of measures which will be binding for all member states. Austria has already implemented some of the measures - including setting up a counselling centre for the prevention of terrorism, reviewing its Law on Islam, and setting up a special police training programme to aid the early detection of victims of radicalization."

migrants at its border with Austria, Austrian authorities said Monday, in an
apparent knock-on effect of Sweden and Denmark tightening frontier controls.
""The daily number of migrants being turned back has risen from 60 in December to 200 since the start of the year,"" David Furtner, police spokesman in Upper Austria state, told AFP.
He said those being sent back were migrants -- mostly Afghans as well as Moroccans and Algerians -- who did not want to apply for asylum in Germany but in other countries, notably Scandinavia.
Austria is a major transit country for the hundreds of thousands of migrants and refugees seeking to enter the European Union, mostly via Upper Austria state at a rate currently of 1,000-2,000 per day.
Last week, Sweden, a favoured destination for many of the migrants, sought to stem the flow by imposing controls on travellers from Denmark.
Denmark in turn introduced spot checks on arrivals from Germany.
Austria meanwhile has moved to tighten controls on its border with Slovenia, with Carinthia, one of two Austrian states bordering Slovenia, turning back 1,652 since January 1, according to police.
Austrian Chancellor Werner Faymann said Monday that Vienna was looking into the legality of turning away ""economic migrants"" -- as opposed to bona fide refugees -- at its borders.
""What is certain is that soon we are going to become more active at our borders,"" Faymann said in an interview with the Kronen-Zeitung daily to be published on Tuesday.
Police spokesman Furtner said that almost all those turned back by Germany simply try again to enter the country, with most succeeding via other routes, Furtner said."

					14:03 CEST+02:00				", The Local,Austria learns of new EU migrant quota details,"The European Commission has announced details of its controversial plan to relocate tens of thousands of migrants who have reached southern Europe. Austria was asked to open its doors to over 1,600 refugees from Africa and the Middle East.
The scheme will see as many as 40,000 migrants already amassed in Greece and Italy temporarily relocated across Europe in an unprecedented emergency measure in order to relieve the pressure on those two countries.
The idea of using quotas to resettle those who have made it to Europe has caused controversy in some EU states - with France, Spain, Hungary, Slovakia and Estonia voicing strong opposition. Austria, along with Sweden, Germany and Italy, is in favour.
Under the mandatory quota system all 28 EU countries will be allocated a specific number of asylum seekers currently in Italy and Greece - mainly from Syria and Eritrea. Austria would be asked to take in 3.03 percent, or a total of 1,213 people.
Countries which agree to take in the asylum seekers will be offered €6,000 per person, with the greatest number to be moved to Germany.
EU member states have been allocated a set number of asylum seekers based on their population size, economic growth and former engagement with asylum seekers.
It is still unclear whether the majority of member states will vote to adopt the proposal.
Only refugees who have been identified as “clearly needing international protection” will be included in the quota.
In addition the commission has made a recommendation on the resettlement of refugees (i.e. a fast tracked asylum process) directly from conflict areas, who have been identified by the UN as needing protection.
This would include 20,000 people over the next two years and will be funded by €50 million from the Commission.
Austria would be asked to grant asylum to 444 people under such a resettlement agreement.
The plan comes after the recent deaths of thousands of migrants trying to cross the Mediterranean.
“Everyone who needs sanctuary should find it in Europe,” said Frans Timmermans, the first vice president of the commission. “But those who have no justified claim should be quickly identified and returned to their home country,” he added."

migration crisis to hit Europe since World War II.
The talks come a day after Merkel vowed zero tolerance for ""vile"" anti-migrant violence in Germany, and amid growing criticism of the European Union's failure to agree a joint response.
Countries taking part include Macedonia and Serbia, two major transit nations for the thousands of migrants and refugees trying to enter the EU by taking the so-called ""western Balkans route"".
The foreign ministers of both countries called for a concerted EU action plan at the start of the summit.
""Unless we have a European answer to this crisis... no one should be under any illusion that this will be solved,"" Macedonia's Nikola Poposki said.
Meanwhile EU member state Hungary, which is a member of the EU's passport-free Schengen zone and has become the bloc's main entry point for migrants arriving by land along the Balkans route, was not attending the meeting.
The daily number of people crossing into Hungary hit a new high on Wednesday, topping 3,000, including nearly 700 children, police figures showed. Hungarian lawmakers will debate next week whether to deploy troops to stem the influx.
Alarmed by the growing humanitarian disaster, United Nations chief Ban Ki-moon has urged countries ""in Europe and elsewhere to prove their compassion and do much more to bring an end to the crisis"".
UN refugee chief Antonio Guterres and French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve meanwhile have called for the urgent creation of more so-called ""hotspots"" -- processing centres to sort refugees fleeing war, from economic migrants simply in search of a better life.
Lack of common vision
Originally meant to focus on EU enlargement, the Balkans summit in Vienna has been hijacked by what organisers have described as ""the migrant challenge"".
Ahead of the conference, Austria's Foreign Minister Sebastian Kurz warned that his country would consider introducing tougher anti-migration measures including ""much tighter border controls"", if the EU failed to come up with a unified response.
""Austria has more migrants than Italy and Greece combined... so we shouldn't pretend that only Italy and Greece are affected,"" he said in an interview with public broadcaster ORF.
With no common European response, governments have approached the problem in various ways.
While Hungary's conservative government is building a 175-kilometre (110-mile) razor-wire barrier to keep migrants out -- a decision slammed by neighbour Serbia -- Czech deputy prime minister Andrej Babis has called for the EU's visa-free Schengen zone to be closed with the help of NATO troops.
'Traitor'
Meanwhile Germany, which is preparing to receive a record 800,000 asylum-seekers this year, has eased the asylum application procedure for Syrians fleeing the country's brutal civil war.
But Berlin's largesse has not been welcomed by everyone at home, particularly in the east where a spate of attacks has targeted refugee centres.
On her visit to a migrant shelter in the eastern town of Heidenau Wednesday, Merkel was greeted by about 200 protesters, some booing and shouting ""traitor, traitor"".
But the German leader, who continues to enjoy strong public support, vowed: ""There will be no tolerance of those who question the dignity of other people.""
'Some hate us'
Also on Wednesday, violence briefly erupted in Hungary's border town of Roszke as police fired tear gas at migrants who were trying to leave a refugee processing centre after refusing to be fingerprinted.
Syrians, Afghans and Pakistanis are among those rushing to reach Hungary before the border is sealed.
""Some people hate us, they look at us in a disgusted way,"" a 22-year-old Syrian man told AFP at the Hungarian border.
He said he had fled the war-torn city of Aleppo and travelled through ""four or five different countries"".
""It makes us feel sad. You know when you walk like that, your clothes will be dirty but that's not what we usually look like.""
The situation is also worsening on Europe's southern shores where rescuers found at least 55 corpses on stricken boats in the Mediterranean on Wednesday, a day that saw some 3,000 others rescued at sea.
Almost all the victims were found in the hold of a boat found drifting off the Libyan coast by a Swedish vessel. Media reports said they had choked to death on gas fumes.
The gruesome discovery adds to a toll of more than 2,300 people who have drowned while attempting the perilous sea crossing since the beginning 2015.
The latest figures already exceed the death toll for the whole of 2014, according to the International Organisation for Migration."

The gruesome discovery of 59 men, eight women and four children crammed inside a poultry refrigerator lorry near the Hungarian border in August 2015 sparked widespread revulsion, and it highlighted the plight of refugees at the hands of merciless smugglers.
It also prompted countries along the now-shut western Balkan migrant route to open their borders to hundreds of thousands of people fleeing war and poverty, mainly in the Middle East.
The trial is being held in the Hungarian town of Kecskemet because authorities determined that the migrants' deaths had occurred in Hungary.
READ ALSO: Austria's migrant crisis - a year that changed the country
The defendants -- 10 Bulgarians, one Afghan and one Lebanese national -- are accused of human trafficking and torture.
Four have also been charged with ""homicide with particularly cruelty"" and face life imprisonment.
They include a 30-year-old Afghan identified as Samsoor L., thought to be the ringleader, and 26-year-old Bulgarian ""death truck"" driver Ivajlo S.
All have been in custody for nearly two years bar one suspect who remains at large and will be tried in absentia.
The court is expected to issue its verdicts by the end of the year.
Prosecutors claim that the men belonged to a ring that smuggled more than 1,200 people into western Europe at the height of the continent's migration crisis.
The group operated between February and August 2015, and brought migrants to Germany or Austria on a daily basis from June that year.
According to prosecutors, refugees were ""often carried in closed, dark and airless vans unsuitable for passenger transport, in crowded, inhuman, excruciating conditions"".
In the case of the 71 asylum seekers, investigators found they had ""suffocated in horrendous conditions"" shortly after being picked up near the Serbian-Hungarian border.
'Screaming the whole time'
Some 59,000 pages of evidence have been gathered detailing the horror find on the side of the A4 motorway in Burgenland state on August 27th 2015.
An Austrian police patrol had spotted the deserted truck and noticed liquid dripping from the vehicle -- decomposing body fluids, as it would later emerge.
Inside, officers discovered a sea of tangled limbs squashed into a 14-square-metre (150-square-feet) cargo container.
Among the corpses was a baby girl, not even a year old.
Investigations showed that the victims -- all from Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan -- had been dead for two days.
The extent of their ordeal was revealed in recently released transcripts of intercepted mobile phone conversations between the smugglers.
""They are screaming the whole time, you can't imagine what's happening here,"" the driver is quoted as saying in the transcripts obtained by German media.
The suspected Afghan boss orders him to ignore the suffocating people and keep on driving: ""If they die... drop them off in a forest in Germany.""
German newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung reported that Hungarian police had intercepted the chats as part of an ongoing probe into the smuggling ring and failed to act.
But Hungarian officials said the conversations had not been listened to in real time but were recorded for later translation.
""If the Hungarian authorities had had a chance to stop this horrible tragedy, they would have done so,"" Hungarian prosecutor Gabor Schmidt told the SZ.
Of the 71 victims, all except one have been identified. Most were repatriated to their home countries, while a dozen have been buried at a Muslim cemetery in Vienna.
A day after the death truck discovery, Samsoor L. and his gang had loaded another 67 migrants into a refrigerator lorry and again driven to Austria.
""This time the migrants could kick the door of the load area open, thus no one had died,"" according to prosecutors."

A strange place, a foreign language, unfamiliar customs, and not much money. People who want to gain a foothold in a new culture, or are forced to as refugees, face many challenges - including bureaucratic obstacles, the pressure to find work and housing, and the need to build a new social environment. Lucas Paletta, from Graz’s Joanneum Research non-profit organisation, is coordinating an EU project which aims to help migrants integrate - with the aid of a smartphone. Maseltov (short for Mobile Assistance for Social Inclusion and Empowerment of Immigrants with Persuasive Learning Technologies and Social Network Services) aims to provide migrants with an information service for their practical needs, a list of helpful authorities, and a navigation service to help them find their way around their new city. Points of interest, such as schools and doctors, are automatically displayed on the app. The smartphone’s camera lens will recognise words on buildings, signs, buses and shops and translate them into the migrants’ native language. A multimedia language learning option offers different levels of customized lessons that help develop competence in the language of the host country - which according to Paletta is one of the main objectives of the app. “We don’t want to make Austrian clones but we do want to help migrants find the right ways to function as a citizen of their new country,” he said.
The aim is that the app will be structured like a computer game - so that the user can advance through different options, like asking for directions at a station, having a conversation with a doctor, or preparing for a job interview. The user can collect points in the different areas of the app and these can be used to personalise their avatar. The Serious Games Institute, from Coventry University, has helped develop that aspect of the app. The app should also function as a way for migrants to connect with other people - the plan is that NGO workers, aid donors, and representatives from the migrant community would be available to chat and advise new migrants via video, call, chat or messaging. A usability study has been carried out with the Austrian Institute of Technology and the Graz NGO Danaida - who invited migrants to workshops in Graz to give feedback and help develop the design and features of the app. A ‘soft launch’ will take place in autumn when around 80 volunteers will test the app. The project is currently seeking an NGO which could advise on how to prevent the anonymous data generated by the app from being misused. Initially Maseltov is intended to be used by Latin American migrants in the UK, Arab migrants in Spain, and Turkish migrants in Austria. From 2015 the app should be available for free, or for a very small fee, for Android and Apple smartphones."

Kurz's comments came as he and his ministers held a special joint session in the Austrian city of Linz with their Bavarian counterparts from the German CSU party, which is currently locked in a battle over migration policy within the government of Chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin.
""We can't wait until we have a catastrophe like the one in 2015,"" Kurz said, referring to the migrant crisis of 2015-16, which saw more than 150,000 people seek asylum in Austria, a country of 8.7 million.
A row over migration policy in Germany between Merkel and her CSU interior minister Horst Seehofer has shaken the stability of the government in Berlin.
Kurz insisted he didn't want to take sides in an ""internal German debate"" but welcomed the fact that immigration was once again being discussed by EU leaders ahead of a summit later this month.
""If the discussion in Germany has an upside, it's that there's now a new dynamic on the European level, and that there's now a bigger chance that we finally see action in the EU,"" Kurz said.
Without naming Merkel he also aimed a shot across her bows by making clear what he thought were the results of her decision to welcome refugees to Germany in 2015.
Those who opened the borders in 2015 ""are responsible for the fact that we have border controls between Austria and Bavaria, between Austria and Hungary, between Austria and Italy, and that the situation could get even worse"", he said.
Kurz, who hails from the centre-right People's Party (ÖVP) went into coalition with the far-right Freedom Party (FPÖ) after an election last year in which both parties made a clampdown on immigration a central theme.
'Common conviction'
Kurz was foreign minister under the previous government and often boasts of his actions to close the ""Balkan route"" for migrants in 2016.
The head of Bavaria's state government, Markus Söder, emphasised that Munich and Vienna ""have a common conviction and position"" on the issue.
Kurz has said he intends to make migration a key theme when Austria takes up the EU's rotating presidency at the beginning of July and has been busy seeking allies for his stance.
Last week he announced that Seehofer, Austria's interior minister Herbert Kickl and Italy's new interior minister Matteo Salvini -- from the xenophobic Northern League -- had formed an ""axis of the willing"" to combat illegal immigration.
On Thursday Kurz will go to Budapest to attend a meeting of leaders from the four central European Visegrad states -- Hungary, Poland, Slovakia and the Czech Republic -- who have traditionally supported hardline policies on migration.

""We hope that ferry services for illegal migrants will be halted between Italian islands like Lampedusa and the Italian mainland,"" Kurz said.

Alfano said there will be a strong ""focus... on the Mediterranean region"", the migration crisis and terror threats, but also on promoting intercultural and inter-religious dialogue.

Vienna is threatening to resume checks on the Brenner Pass between the two countries as part of a package of anti-migrant measures if Italy does not do more to reduce the number of new arrivals heading to Austria.
The Alpine route is a major European transport corridor and a key link between the north and south of the continent, said Juncker during an interview with Germany's Funke Mediengruppe.
""This is why everything that blocks the Brenner Pass will have not just serious economic consequences, but most importantly heavy political consequences,"" he said.
With over 28,500 migrants arriving since January 1, Italy has once again become the principal entry point for migrants arriving in Europe, following a controversial EU-Turkey deal and the closure of the Balkan route up from Greece.
In previous years, many migrants landing in Italy have headed on to other countries including Austria but Rome now fears it could be stuck hosting thousands of new arrivals.
On average 2,500 lorries and 15,000 cars travel daily through the Brenner Pass -- a crucial lifeline for Italy's exports to northern Europe that is already prone to delays even without border checks.
Austria sits at the crossroads of the two major migrant routes, from the Balkans and from Italy, and saw hundreds of thousands of migrants cross its territory in 2015.
Authorities have received around 90,000 asylum applications from people fleeing war, persecution and poverty who have opted to settle in the country.
Juncker also raised the alarm over Austria's response to the migrant crisis which he said had tempted other countries to close their borders while making far-right politics ""presentable"" elsewhere in Europe.
""What we see in Austria we have unfortunately seen in other European countries, where (political) parties play with people's fears,"" he said."

The Renaissance-era structure, located near the central square of the picturesque town of Braunau in Upper Austria, is considered prime real estate. At a recent 'Birthplace Summit', held at the Interior Ministry in early May, the house's current owner and representatives from Braunau met with Austria's Interior Ministry to discuss the fate of the controversial building. For decades however, the shadow of Adolf Hitler - its most infamous son - has hung over the former guest house, creating a constant headache for Braunau's administration. Born on April 20th, 1889, Hitler lived at Salzburger Vorstadt 15 until he was three. In 1938, shortly before the outbreak of World War II, Martin Bormann, Hitler's private secretary, purchased the house on behalf of the Nazi Party for four times its market value, with plans to turn it into a shrine to the dictator. Currently owned by a retired local woman who refuses to reveal her identity, the building has been rented by the Austrian Interior Ministry since 1972. While the Interior Ministry has carefully vetted tenants to ensure no Hitler-admirers can occupy the premises, the owner has refused to let Braunau officials hang a plaque warning of the evils of fascism. Until now, the building has been used as a library, bank, technical high school and most recently as a workshop for the mentally handicapped. A previous proposal to convert the house into a living space sparked fears the building may fill with Hitler worshippers. Suggestions to create an anti-Nazi memorial have also been rejected. After remaining empty for the past two years, it seems the owner may now be ready to agree to a new plan for the dilapidated house - as an integration office and language school for migrants, according to a report in Der Standard newspaper. After some 'difficult' discussions, representatives from Braunau and the Interior Ministry are optimistic that a solution will soon be reached."

Integration Councillor Sandra Frauenberger (SPÖ) said that 31 percent of people with a migration background are first generation immigrants, and 18 percent are second generation. 23 percent of Viennese residents have a foreign passport. According to the latest findings from the monitoring group more than half of those immigrants who have lived in Vienna since the mid-1990s have finished secondary school. But despite their qualifications they have trouble finding decent jobs - especially those who originally come from non-EU countries. A third of those with good Matura grades only find work in semi-skilled, low-paid jobs. The net income of households with no migration background has increased by ten percent in the last ten years - to an average of €23,000 a year. However, in households with a migration background the average household income remains at €15,000. Frauenberger said that the city council wants migrant's existing skills and qualifications to have more recognition.
She also said that it was a problem that 24 percent of Vienna’s voting age population are excluded from casting their ballot because they don’t have Austrian citizenship. A change to the voting law can only be made at federal level. The number of people taking Austrian citizenship this year is up 6.4 percent on last year, according to the latest figures from Statistik Austria. 5,671 people took Austrian citizenship in the first nine months of this year, the majority were from Bosnia and Herzegovina (14.8 percent), followed by Turkey (12 percent), and Serbia (9 percent). More than a third of new citizens were born in Austria. Birth in Austria does not in itself confer Austrian citizenship, but it may lead to a reduction in the residence requirement for naturalisation.

The ""Managing Migration Together"" meeting in Vienna involves the foreign and interior ministers of Albania, Bosnia, Bulgaria, Croatia, Kosovo, Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia and Slovenia.
Greece's foreign ministry said that being left out meant that the conference was ""an attempt to take decisions in Greece's absence that directly affect Greece and Greek borders.""
Greece has also accused Austria of undermining efforts to reach a joint European response to the migration crisis by siding with hardline EU members who refuse to take any refugees.

Austrian ministers had written a letter to the EU Commission requesting that if, for example, a Romanian couple are resident in Austria but their children live in Romania - then the child benefit money they are eligible for should be reduced to the amount they could claim in Romania.
The child benefit allowance is much lower in countries like Romania and Bulgaria. Austria's benefits for families are very generous, accounting for around 2.8 percent of the country's GDP compared to the EU average of 2.4 percent.
Figures show that the amount of child benefit paid in 2015 to the children of EU migrants living outside of Austria was €249 million. Ministers say they could save around €100 million if the benefit was withheld under certain conditions or based on the cost of living in the migrant's home country.
In June, the European Court of Justice said it was lawful for the UK to withhold family benefits to EU migrants who were not working if they did not have the right to reside in the UK. It said it was justified on the basis of ""protecting"" a state's finances. However, since Britain later voted to leave the EU in a referendum on June 23rd, the ruling no longer applies.
Some Austrian ministers have said that Austrian families are being “discriminated against” as the child benefit payment covers about half of their monthly costs whereas for parents with children in other member states where the cost of living is lower the benefit payment allows them to live very comfortably.
However, an internal paper from the EU Commission, which has been seen by Austria’s Kurier newspaper, says that there will be no EU-wide indexing of child benefits as such a system would be too complicated to implement and would not have significant economic advantages.
A spokesman from the EU Commission told the Kurier that the goal is to ultimately make social systems across the EU fairer. He added that some members of the commission are in favour of reducing social benefits, but that they are not the majority."

Orban on Tuesday described the arrival of asylum seekers in Europe as ""a
poison"", saying his country did not want or need ""a single migrant"".
""Hungary does not need a single migrant for the economy to work, or the population to sustain itself, or for the country to have a future,"" he told a joint press conference in Budapest with Austrian Chancellor Christian Kern.
""This is why there is no need for a common European migration policy: whoever needs migrants can take them, but don't force them on us, we don't need them,"" Orban said.
The populist strongman added that ""every single migrant poses a public security and terror risk"".
""For us migration is not a solution but a problem... not medicine but a poison, we don't need it and won't swallow it,"" he said.
Orban is a fierce opponent of the European Union's troubled plan to share migrants across the 28-nation bloc under a mandatory quota system.
Hungary has filed a legal challenge against the proposal and will hold a referendum on its participation in the scheme on October 2.
Hundreds of thousands of migrants and refugees trekked through Hungary and Austria in 2015 as they sought to reach wealthy European nations.
But the flow slowed to a trickle after Orban's government erected razor wire and fences along the southern borders last autumn and brought in tough anti-migrant laws.
However, numbers have been rising again in recent months, reaching almost 18,000 so far this year.
In response Budapest introduced further security measures this month, including the controversial forced return to no-man's land between Hungary and Serbia of any migrant found within eight kilometres (five miles) of the southern border.
'We have to assist'
In early July, Austria promised to send 20 police officers to the Serbian frontier, where around 20 asylum seekers a day are allowed to cross into a border ""transit zone"" and apply for asylum.
The offer marked a turnaround for Vienna, previously a vocal critic of Hungary's hardline treatment of migrants.
Kern, on his first visit to Hungary since becoming chancellor in May, said migration to Austria and Germany had declined thanks to Hungary's tough measures.
""If we are beneficiaries from this process, then we have to assist it,"" he said.
But Kern also stressed that nongovernmental aid agencies should be allowed to help people stranded on the Serbian side of the border.
Around 1,400 people are waiting in squalid makeshift camps at the border, according to the UNHCR.
Kern and Orban also discussed the return of migrants from Austria to Hungary, which has been a recent source of tension between the two countries.
After their meeting, Orban said his government was willing to take back from Austria asylum seekers registered as having entered the EU in Hungary.
This affects primarily Balkan migrants, which only make up a small number of those Vienna wants to send back."

When Austria welcomed its first Turkish guest workers in 1964 there was little reaction from locals. Austria was not in fact the first choice of many so-called Gastarbeiters, many of whom would have preferred to go to Germany or Switzerland, where wage levels were higher. Sylvia Hahn, Vice-Rector of the University of Salzburg, told delegates at a symposium on fifty years of labour recruitment in Vienna on Monday that ""concerted attempts at integration only began in the 1980s."" According to the 1964 agreement, an Austrian commission laid down rules for recruitment of Turkish workers by Austrian companies. ""The conditions were not particularly attractive,"" said Hahn. Wages offered in Austria at the time were commensurate with those in Mediterranean countries, said Cengiz Günay, from the Austrian Institute for International Politics. A previous attempt at recruiting workers from Spain in 1962 had failed. Hahn outlines four phases in the history of Turkish guest workers in Austria. Initially they were brought for short term assignments, with jobs in the major industries being reserved for domestic workers. Turkish workers were employed in the textile, ski and paper industries, while many Turkish women found work in the booming tourism business. The 1980s oil crisis was a turning point. Immigration restrictions were introduced and many migrant workers lost their jobs, prompting wide scale relocation within Austria. Around this time, a family reunification program began, along with the creation of a rudimentary migrant infrastructure. The collapse of communist Eastern Europe ushered in a new era, creating what Hahn describes as a ""two-tier labour market"". Unemployment among youth and older workers began to rise. Smaller businesses in various provinces began to use Turkish workers and some Turks began to work independently. While ""marriage migration"" increased numbers, many Turkish pensioners began to return to the ""old country"". Toward the end of the '90s and early 2000s, xenophobia and Islamophobia began to increase. At the same time, second and third generation Turkish migrants began to participate more in society, although many now remain in rural enclaves. Hahn echoes Foreign Minister Sebastian Kurz's appeal ""to give the Turks in the country more attention"". She describes their family life as a ""coming and going"". ""Many Turkish children grow up between two worlds. For example, some live with grandparents in Turkey. This is a disadvantage for some, but advantageous for others."" According to Günay, 76 percent of Turks in Austria watch Turkish TV, while only a few watch Austrian television. Apart from the language barrier, this has something to do with feeling a sense of exclusion. On June 19th, Turkish Prime Minister, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan will hold one of his often controversial speeches at Vienna's Albert-Schultz Ice Rink."

Both countries are part of the passport-free Schengen zone and have been key transit countries for tens of thousands of refugees and migrants desperately seeking to reach northern Europe via the Balkans.
""This is about ensuring an orderly, controlled entry into our country, not about shutting down the border,"" she told public broadcaster Ö1.
Mikl-Leitner, a member of the conservative ÖVP party, added that the situation risked escalating as people were forced to wait in freezing temperatures for hours before being allowed to cross from one nation into another.
""We know that in recent days and weeks individual groups of migrants have become more impatient, aggressive and emotional. If groups of people push from behind, with children and women stuck in-between, you need stable, massive measures,"" she said.
Austria 'out of line'
However, Germany said on Wednesday that Europe's refugee crisis cannot be solved with the construction of border fences or walls.
""We do not believe that the current migrant crisis that Europe is facing can be resolved with the building of fences or walls,"" said government spokesman Steffen Seibert, adding that the problem could only be dealt with if Europe stood united.
Germany's Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere has hit out at Austria for sending asylum seekers to its border without any warning, saying the neighbouring country's behaviour was ""out of line"".
""The behaviour of Austria in recent days was out of line. We have to complain that refugees were driven without any warning after dark to... the German border,"" he said.
De Maiziere said both sides have discussed the problem, and that ""Austria yesterday pledged to return to an orderly process."" ""I expect that to happen immediately. We are in constant contact on that aspect,"" he added.
'Fortress Europe'
Previously, Austrian ministers had avoided using the word 'fence' - talking instead about the need for ""special structural measures"" on the border. Last week, Mikl-Leitner drew strong criticism from opposition members for saying that it was time for the EU to ""build fortress Europe"".
But Defence Minister Gerald Klug, of the Social Democrats, told Ö1 radio that he supports the idea of a fence, which is necessary ""in order to properly control the refugees"" but that ""we must not lose sight of humanity"". He added that Hungary's razor-sharp barbed wire fences were not the solution.
The Secretary-General of Amnesty Austria, Heinz Patzelt, told Ö1 that fences are ""a symbol of a lack of solidarity"" - and that barriers would not deter refugees from trying to enter Austria.
Mikl-Leitner said in a statement sent to the media that the fence would be ""solid and stretch several kilometres left and right of the border crossing"", but did not give a date for when construction would begin.
She also said that 200 police officers would be trained to become special border police, and that Austria needs an additional 2,000 officers as the force is stretched to its limits."

President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Tuesday warned the European Union that the Turkish parliament would block laws related to the deal if Ankara was not granted its key demand of visa-free travel.
The stark warning came amid spiralling tensions between the Turkish leader and the EU over a string of issues ranging from existing accords to human rights.
There have been growing indications Turks will not be given the visa-free travel by the target of the end of June, and Merkel warned after talks with Erdogan on Monday that the target was unlikely to be met.
EU leaders are insisting that Turkey abide by 72 conditions before the visa exemption takes place, with a demand to change counter-terrorism laws proving particularly contentious.
The EU wants Ankara to narrow its definition of terror to stop prosecuting academics and journalists for publishing ""terror propaganda"".
Austria's Defence Minister Hans Peter Doskozil said on Wednesday meanwhile that the country was ready should the deal between the EU and Turkey collapse and the flow of migrants resume.
""We are preparing ourselves... We want to signal that we are capable of controlling our own borders,"" Doskozil told reporters in the southern Austrian city of Klagenfurt.
Austria last year became a key transit country for hundreds of thousands of migrants travelling up from Greece through the western Balkans, mostly towards Germany and Scandinavia.
The inflow has slowed to a trickle however since countries along this ""Balkan route"" closed their borders and the EU-Turkey accord came into force in March.
Austria has nevertheless been preparing border controls in case the influx starts again, including at the alpine Brenner Pass on the border with Italy, to the annoyance of Rome.

Currently, foreign-born residents in Vienna make up 33 percent of the population, and this is expected to increase to more than 40 percent by 2035.
In Vienna’s Kindergartens around 58 percent of children don’t speak German as their mother language. Statistics show that children from migrant families tend to have a disadvantage when it comes to education, with the majority going on to attend vocational schools rather than gymnasium and then university.
Austrians with higher qualifications generally have better employment opportunities and earnings increase as an adult’s level of education and skills increase.
In Vienna 47.5 percent of school pupils say that they don’t speak German at home. Kurz wants to introduce special German classes for children who speak it as a second language. ""Only when children have a sufficient grasp of German, should they be allowed to join regular classes,"" he said. He added that this shouldn’t be “an emergency solution” but was the only ""rational solution"".
A report last year from the OECD showed that Austria spent €4.5bn in 2013 on tertiary education, yet literacy skills remain poor compared with other industrialised countries.
Asylum seekers who have been granted leave to remain in Austria will soon have their benefits cut if they don’t attend German courses and show that they are willing to look for work.
There are currently 2,300 refugee children attending school in Vienna and since the start of the year ten ‘New to Vienna’ classes have been set up especially for refugee children, which are designed to enable them learn German as quickly as possible.
Education experts have admitted that it is a major challenge to make sure refugee children can be speedily integrated into Austrian schools. There is also a need for private tutors, trauma counsellors and violence prevention courses.

While the measures have led to a sharp drop in arrivals, experts warn the crisis is far from over.

The men, women and children had suffocated shortly after smugglers had picked them up in Hungary, a key transit country on the so-called Balkan migrant trail.
'Spirit of solidarity'
The case sparked international revulsion, highlighting the plight of desperate people putting their lives in the hands of traffickers.
On the day of the discovery, German Chancellor Angela Merkel was in Austria for a migrant crisis summit with Balkan leaders.
Upon hearing the news, she said the deaths were a clear call to action to tackle the issue ""quickly and in... a spirit of solidarity"".
Days later, Germany - the favoured destination of many migrants - announced it would welcome all Syrian refugees.
The move triggered a wave of arrivals. By the end of 2015, more than a million people from the Middle East, as well as Asia and Africa had landed on European shores, creating the continent's biggest refugee crisis since World War II.
Countries on the migrant trail organised trains and buses to transport people to Austria and Germany, where they were greeted with applause and cheers.
Waning enthusiasm
Since then, the enthusiasm has waned. The crisis has fuelled anti-migrant sentiment and boosted the popularity of far-right parties across Europe.
The Balkan migrant route was shut earlier this year after countries clamped down on their borders.
In the face of growing public hostility, the EU signed a deal with Turkey in March to stem the influx.
But fears are growing that the pact could collapse amid a deepening rift with Ankara over its crackdown following a failed July 15 coup.
Migrant arrivals have been slightly on the rise again in recent weeks, particularly in Italy which has rescued some 94,000 people in the Mediterranean so far this year. Another 54,000 migrants remain stuck in Greece.
However, EU member states have become reluctant to accept more migrants and some have begun imposing restrictions.
Austria, which last year received the bloc's second-highest number of asylum requests on a per-capita basis, has capped applications for this year at 37,500.
Vienna is also considering the introduction of an emergency decree in September allowing it to reject migrants directly at the border.
Smugglers change tactics
Some 100 to 150 migrants and asylum seekers currently arrive in Austria per day, according to interior ministry figures.
The numbers are similar to those in August 2015 before the truck tragedy happened.
The main difference is that criminals now smuggle fewer people because of tighter border controls, said Tatzgern.
Instead of vans or trucks, ""traffickers now prefer private cars,"" he said. Four Bulgarians and an Afghan remain in custody in Hungary pending trial over their involvement in the case of the 71 dead migrants.
""We hope the investigation will be finished this autumn,"" said court spokesman Gabor Schmidt this week.
As for the victims, all except one have been identified. Most were repatriated to their home countries, while a dozen have been buried at a Muslim cemetery in Vienna.
In their memory, the mayor of Parndorf has commissioned a play about the tragedy, due to premiere in January."

resume controversial checks on its frontier with Italy after tougher measures
by Rome have led to a huge drop in migrant numbers.
Vienna had threatened to re-impose controls on the Brenner Pass in the Alps as part of a string of anti-migrant measures if Italy failed to reduce the number of new arrivals heading to Austria.
""The number of illegal migrants has dropped to almost zero in the past weeks,"" Interior Minister Wolfgang Sobotka told a joint press conference with his Italian counterpart Angelino Alfano at the pass, a key north-south route.
""That's why it is not necessary to carry out border controls at the Brenner pass for now,"" Sobotka said.
He added that reinforced train controls by Italian, Austrian and German officials had helped slow the influx to a trickle.
""The number of illegal migrants has dropped to almost zero in the past weeks,"" Interior Minister Wolfgang Sobotka told a joint press conference with his Italian counterpart Angelino Alfano at the pass, a key north-south route.
Alfano said he was ""happy"" that Austria had recognised Italian efforts to address the issue.
He also said that 110 extra guards would patrol the Alpine crossing point between the two countries.
The historic Alpine route is a major European transport corridor, with some 5,550 lorries passing through on a daily basis -- a crucial lifeline for Italy's exports to northern Europe that is already prone to delays even without border checks.
But Vienna has been concerned that it could also become a new route for migrants and refugees following the closure of the Balkan trail leading from Greece towards western and northern Europe.
More than 28,500 people have already landed on Italy's shores so far this year after setting off from Libya.
The influx prompted Austria last month to launch preliminary construction work of a new ""border management system"" at the Brenner pass.
The move, coupled with the government's threat to carry out tough checks, caused tensions with Rome and sparked violent protests at the pass in recent weeks.
It also drew strong criticism from the EU's executive body, the European Commission, with its president Jean-Claude Juncker calling the proposal a ""political catastrophe"" for Europe last week.
Friday's announcement comes a day after the EU approved a six-month extension of existing border controls in the passport-free Schengen Zone, brought in last year by several countries including Austria to stem the flow.
More than a million people fleeing war, persecution and poverty in the Middle East and elsewhere arrived in Europe last year, triggering the continent's worst migration crisis since the end of World War II.
Austria received around 90,000 asylum applications in 2015, the second-highest number on a per-capita basis in the EU after Sweden.
The influx has boosted support for the anti-immigration Freedom Party -- which is now leading the polls ahead of a scheduled 2018 general election -- and become a major headache for the ruling centrist coalition, with Chancellor Werner Faymann resigning on Monday."

Vienna announced on Tuesday it would step up controls at existing checkpoints along its southern borders with Italy, Slovenia and Hungary to slow down the influx of migrants and refugees trekking up along the Balkans.
Last month, Austria warned it would limit this year's number of asylum seekers to 37,500 -- sharply down from the 90,000 it accepted in 2015.
The ruling centrist coalition also plans to impose a daily migrant limit this week at its main border crossing with Slovenia.
""A government must take decisions based on reality,"" Faymann said in an interview published by the Kurier newspaper on Wednesday.
""We have done this and I believe we have set an example that Germany will also set shortly,"" he added.
In 2015, over one million people reached Europe's shores -- nearly half of them Syrians fleeing a civil war that has claimed more than 260,000 lives.
The vast majority enter the EU through Italy and Greece, where they should register, but poor controls mean most are able to continue their journeys to northern Europe.
Faymann said Austria still supported a deal proposed by Germany, under which Turkey would seal its borders and then fly refugees to Europe where they would be settled under an EU quota system.
But in the face of the plan's sluggish implementation, Vienna has also joined the so-called ""Visegrad Four"" -- Hungary, Poland, Slovakia and the Czech Republic -- which want tighter border controls inside the EU's passport-free Schengen zone.
On Thursday, Faymann and his German counterpart Angela Merkel will host talks with nine EU countries and Turkey in Brussels, hours before a summit involving all 28 bloc leaders.
""I would like for Turkey to take stronger actions against migrant people smugglers... and for Turkey and Greece to strike a deal to return rejected migrants,"" Faymann told the Kurier.
But he added: ""We must also prepare tougher border measures"" in case the EU efforts fail."

					12:33 CEST+02:00				", The Local,Austria's policy 'improving business for smugglers',"With smuggling again on the rise in Austria and the government planning to build more anti-migrant fences, fears are increasing that the country could see a repeat of last summer’s tragedy when 71 smuggled refugees suffocated to death in the back of a truck.
Preparations to raise fences in the province of Burgenland along Austria's border with Hungary are already underway, with the first phrase of fences planned at the border crossings of Moschendorf and Heiligenbrunn and later at Heiligenkreuz und Nickelsdorf.
A regional police spokesman told the ORF that the measures were being taken following the experience in September and October last year when refugees made their way by foot from Hungary to Austria.
Meanwhile a border inspection centre and a barrier are being built at the Brenner border pass between Italy and Austria, with the Interior Ministry expecting many migrants and refugees to come via Italy following the closure of the West Balkans route.
The Ministry confirmed on Thursday that these measures at Brenner alone will cost around 1.1 million.
Migrant policy is ""a trafficker promotion programme”
As the routes to central Europe have gradually been shut down, Austria has seen an increase in the number smuggling incidents.
Just last Monday 27 refugees - including 16 children and teenagers - were found in the back of a truck that had been pulled over for a police check near Rohrbach.
The smuggler - a 31-year-old Ukrainian - had handed over the driving to one of the refugees and already left the vehicle but was picked up by authorities a short while later.
The Federal Office of Crime have confirmed that smuggling is again on the rise, with the head of the office Gerald Tatzgern telling the ORF the smugglers are trying to find ways to bring migrants into Austria.
Speaking to The Local Austria, the head of Austria’s Red Cross Migration and Legal Affairs Bernhard Schneider says these smuggling incidents are a direct consequence of the closure of migrants routes for refugees.
“The closure of any migrant route leads without doubt to improved business for smugglers. With the closing of the borders - the west Balkan route or the building of control infrastructure at Brenner - refugees have no other possibility than to journey with smugglers,” Schneider said.
“Smugglers demand a lot of money and the routes they take are obviously illegal and therefore difficult, dangerous and lengthy. For these reasons the danger to smuggled refugees, either to their health or even to their lives, is clearly higher.""
""Only at the end of August 2015 on the east motorway A4 in Austria was a refrigerated truck found with 71 dead refugees inside, including women and children.”
""You can therefore conclude that the policy of closing the asylum route is good business for smugglers and causes deaths. One must be clear about these consequences.”
Herbert Langthaler from Austria’s Asylkoordination, which provides legal support to refugees, agrees, describing European refugee politics as “something like a trafficker promotion programme”.
“If politics, police and army try to prevent refugees from coming in the country legally there is no other opportunity than to ask traffickers for the transport,” he said, speaking to the Local Austria
Many Austrian NGOs are instead calling for the government to introduce an effective legal route for people to travel to the EU to they can apply for international protection.
“Of course the protection of borders is a legitimate concern of governments and a responsibility of the state,” Schneider said. “But more important than the protection of borders is the protection of fleeing people.”"

In an interview with the German newspaper Bild, Doskozil stated, ""I have always said the EU-Turkey deal should only be a stop-gap measure until the EU is in the position to effectively protect its external borders and thereby stem the flow of migrants"".
This comment comes after defence ministers from Central European states agreed to meet in Vienna to discuss tactics regarding the current state of EU-Turkey deal. Doskozil believes, ""the time to organize [...] is ever closer."" The meeting in question took place today and will continue tomorrow in Sarajevo.
In effect since March, the deal was originally designed to manage the giant influx of migrants that occurred in 2015 by sending undocumented individuals back to Turkey. In exchange, the EU promised to accelerate visa-free travel to the EU for Turkish citizens and to deliver three billion Euros in funding.
In an interview with Oe1 radio, Minister for Foreign Affairs and Integration Sebastian Kurz observed that ""over recent years Turkey has moved further and further away from the EU, but our policy has remained the same. That can't work. What we need are clear consequences.""
Deutsche Welle reports that, as opposed to going back to Turkey, the result to date has been that asylum applications for newly landed migrants have dramatically increased in Greece, rather than in richer European countries. According to Kurz, ""this does not correspond to the situation in Turkey and as a result this policy must be changed."""

100,000 migrants by the end of the month, Europe's migration commissioner
warned on Saturday, two days ahead of an EU-Turkey summit seen as the only
viable solution to the crisis.
As EU members continued to bicker, Dimitris Avramopoulos, in charge of migration at the powerful Brussels executive, pointed to upcoming measures, including an overhaul of asylum rules, to help ease tensions.
""Hundreds are arriving on a daily basis and Greece is expected to receive another 100,000 by the end of the month,"" Avramopoulos told a conference in Athens.
Greece lies at the heart of Europe's greatest migration crisis in six decades after a series of border restrictions on the migrant trail from Austria to Macedonia caused a bottleneck on its soil.
Over 30,000 refugees and migrants are now trapped in the country, desperate to head northwards, especially to Germany and Scandinavia.
""In a few weeks,"" the EU will announce a revision of its asylum regulations to ensure a ""fairer distribution of the burden and the responsibility,"" Avramopoulous told the conference.
Summit hopes
The huge influx of refugees and migrants has caused major divisions within the EU, although European President Donald Tusk on Friday struck an upbeat note about Monday's summit in Brussels, which will include Turkey.
European leaders are expected to use the summit to press Ankara to take back more economic migrants from Greece and reduce the flow of people across the Aegean Sea.
Finger-pointing continued within the 28-nation EU bloc on Saturday.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel -- a key player in the drama -- said Greece should have been quicker in preparing to host 50,000 people under an agreement with the European Union in October.
""Greece should have created 50,000 accommodation places for refugees by the end of 2015,"" Merkel told Bild newspaper in an interview to appear Sunday.
""This delay must be addressed as soon as possible as the Greek government must provide decent lodgings to asylum claimants"", she said.
Germany's neighbour, Austria, meanwhile, reiterated its call for Berlin to establish an annual quota of refugees.
Last year, 1.1 million migrants arrived in Germany under Merkel's liberal asylum policy -- a flood that other countries have said is just not sustainable.
""Germany, for its part, has to determine a figure for the number of refugees which can be accepted, which it is willing to go and pick up in the Syria and Turkey region,"" Austrian Chancellor Werner Faymann said in an interview in the daily Kurier.
The quota could be ""400,000 refugees"" per year, Faymann said, using Austria's intake -- 37,500 in a country of 8.5 million for 2016 -- as a benchmark.
""At the end of the day, Germany has to be clear about things, otherwise refugees will continue to head there"", Faymann said.
Border problems
Around a third of migrant buildup in Greece is at the Idomeni crossing, on the country's norther border with non-EU member Macedonia.
Aid groups have sounded the alarm, reporting food and tent shortages and deteriorating hygiene.
""There are 13,000 people here and nearly 20,000 in this prefecture, over 60 percent of the country's entire refugee and migrant flow,"" Apostolos Tzitzikostas, regional governor of Greece's central Macedonia prefecture, told Skai television on Saturday.
""We can no longer shoulder this burden by ourselves.""
Greece sent in the army in February to speed up the creation of open camps for migrants and refugees but has occasionally run into opposition from local authorities.
The charity Doctors Without Borders (MSF) on Saturday began erecting additional tents at Idomeni to shelter over 1,000 people who could not fit in the camp and have been sleeping in muddy fields and ditches, an AFP reporter said.
In past days, the mainly Syrian and Iraqi refugees have regularly held protests in front of the barbed-wire fence guarded by Macedonian riot police, demanding to be allowed through.
""I don't know what will happen""
Hussam, a 25-year-old Syrian, said the refugees were hoping that Monday's EU-Turkey summit will provide a breakthrough.
""We are calm now because we are hoping for a positive outcome on Monday, that they will help us pass,"" Hussam said. ""If there isn't one, I don't know what will happen.""
According to Greek officials, Macedonia has allowed some 2,000 people through its borders in the last two weeks. The same number of people fleeing war and poverty arrive in Greece from neighbouring Turkey in two days.
Some 200 people were allowed through between Friday and Saturday, with Macedonian police calling into question registration documents handed to refugees by Greek police at the islands.
In many cases, the documents do not carry full dates of birth, only the year, while disputes over the correct colour of a police stamp can also hold up the process for hours.
Athens is building additional facilities to house the refugees and migrants, but many prefer to go to the border in the hope of eventually getting through, and are stuck there for days and weeks.
Greece has asked the EU for 480 million euros ($526 million) in emergency funds to help shelter 100,000 refugees. A senior UN migration official has warned that the numbers stuck in Greece will probably reach 70,000 in the coming weeks."

Doskozil on Monday caused uproar by suggesting that Vienna was prepared to mobilize troops along the main Brenner mountain pass through the Alps between Italy and Austria to protect his country from migrants.
In response, Italy summoned Austria's ambassador and Interior Minister Marco Minniti warned that Vienna's “unjustified” threat could impact security cooperation between the two countries.
Kern's media office told AFP he had spoken with Italian officials on Wednesday “to remove any misunderstanding”.

Italy has taken in nearly 85 percent – most of them sub-Saharan Africans crossing from conflict-ravaged Libya – and has pleaded for help from other European Union nations, saying it is struggling to cope.
Minniti said Wednesday that other EU countries should share the burden of the migrant crisis.

The Defence Minister - who was the head of Burgenland police when the region became an epicentre of the refugee crisis last year - told the Krone Zeitung he thinks that statement acted as a pull factor for refugees to come to Europe.
He was speaking almost a year to the day that 71 refugees were found dead in the back of a truck in Austria, triggering a wave of solidarity across Europe.

The Austrian Social Democrat (SPÖ) politician also called for Europe to convene a special summit on deportation to build an alliance of countries affected by the crisis and negotiate how to return people to their native countries.
“It is not a policy if Europe remains in agony and sticks its head in the sand,” he said. He added that he thinks Europe has failed to learn from mistakes made last year when dealing with the arrival of millions of refugees and migrants.

Arrivals in Italy are believed to be on the verge of spiking upwards because of the closing down of the migrant route to central Europe via Greece and the Balkans.
The measures taken at Brenner follow the earlier introduction of checks near the southern border town of Spielfeld and comes amid the erecting of fences along Austria’s eastern border with Hungary.
Speaking following a meeting with politicians in Tyrol and Italy’s South Tyrol region, Austrian Interior Minister Wolfgang Sobotka confirmed that border checks at Brenner are necessary “to continue to guarantee the security of Austria.”
He confirmed they will be introduced at the end of May, adding that a fence may also be erected along the border “if Italy does not introduce measures” to control the numbers at the border.
This was reiterated by the head of the police in Tyrol Helmut Tomac, who said they expect between 400 and 500 refugees a day at Brenner rather than the tens of thousands who arrived at Spielfeld last year.
Tomac added that this depended on whether Italian authorities took measures to organise the refugees, for example by “sending them back again”.
“Then there is no need for a fence,” he said, quoted in the ORF.

Security crackdown
Many of the migrants slept at Vienna's Westbahnhof station, hoping to continue on their journey to Germany, which last week eased asylum
restrictions for Syrian refugees.
Europe is struggling to cope with its biggest movement of people since World War II, with more than 300,000 arriving this year, many fleeing war,
persecution and poverty in the Middle East and Africa.
The plight of the refugees was brought sharply into focus last week after 71 people, including four children, were found dead in an abandoned truck on an Austrian motorway near the Hungarian border.
So far, police in Hungary and Bulgaria and have arrested seven people in connection with the truck tragedy, among them four Bulgarians and one Afghan.
The nationalities of the other two were not known.
The grim discovery led to a security crackdown in Austria with massive tailbacks forming along the border on Monday, as officers inspected vehicles

'We want to leave!'
The escalating situation has divided the 28-member bloc ahead of emergency talks on September 14, with western European leaders calling for greater efforts to help the new arrivals as countries on its eastern borders warned they were struggling to cope.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel warned Monday that the refugee crisis was testing the core ideals of universal rights at the heart of the EU, urging all
states to take their fair share of asylum seekers.
She also made veiled criticism of countries like Slovakia which has said it would reject migrants from majority Muslim countries. ""If we start saying 'I do not want Muslims' ... that cannot be good"".
At heart of the crisis lies the question over how to distribute the migrants across the EU and help relieve pressure on so-called ""frontline"" nations where migrants arrive by sea or land.
Much-flouted EU rules stipulate that refugees should be processed in the first country they reach.
But EU member Hungary -- like Austria, a country of transit for migrants heading to northern Europe -- says it cannot host record numbers of newcomers,
as 50,000 migrants arrived in August.
Arrivals in Germany
German police registered a record 2,200 migrant arrivals in a key southern border region with Austria in the 24 hours to Tuesday morning, federal police said.
The arrivals spiked as passenger trains, each packed with hundreds of refugees, left Hungary and crossed through Austria to head into Germany's
southern Bavaria state.
It was the highest number recorded by any of Germany's 10 federal police districts since the start of the migrant crisis that is expected to bring 800,000 newcomers to Europe's top economy this year.
The numbers were registered by the Munich police district, which stretches from the Bavarian state capital down to the Austrian border, between 0600 GMT Monday and 0600 GMT Tuesday, a police spokesman told AFP.
Fake Syrian passports
Budapest's right-wing government on Monday criticised Berlin's easing of asylum rules as ""(building) up the hopes of illegal immigrants"".
Hungary's own response has been to build a razor-wire fence along its border with Serbia to try to keep migrants out.
As vast numbers surge towards Europe with the hope of claiming asylum, a brisk trade in false Syrian passports has emerged, predominantly in Turkey,
the EU's Frontex border agency said on Tuesday.
""There are people who are in Turkey now who buy fake Syrian passports because they know Syrians get the right to asylum in all the member states of
the European Union,"" Fabrice Leggeri told French radio station Europe 1.
""People who use fake Syrian passports often speak Arabic. They may come from North Africa or the Middle East but they have the profile of economic
migrants,"" he said.
Meanwhile, 20,000 people took to the streets of Vienna late Monday in a show of support for migrants, while senior government officials attended a
church service for the 71 refugees found dead last week."

					23:43 CEST+02:00				",The Local/AFP,Hundreds protest again at Brenner Pass checks,"Several hundred young protesters
clashed with Italian anti-riot police Saturday near the Austrian-Italian
border during a demonstration against Vienna's proposed anti-migrant measures.
The protesters, who briefly occupied the small train station at the Brenner Pass, were confronted by police as they tried to cross the border from Italy into Austria.
Some threw stones and smoke bombs at police who responded with tear gas, an AFP photographer at the scene reported.
Two police officers were wounded and a police car was torched while several protesters were arrested, according to Italy's AGI news agency.
Vienna is threatening to resume checks on the Brenner Pass between the two countries as part of a package of anti-migrant measures if Italy does not do more to reduce the number of new arrivals heading to Austria.
But imposing controls on the Austrian border with Italy would be a ""political catastrophe"" for Europe, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said Saturday.
The Alpine route is a major European transport corridor and a key link between the north and south of the continent, said Juncker during an interview with Germany's Funke Mediengruppe.
""This is why everything that blocks the Brenner Pass will have not just serious economic consequences, but most importantly heavy political consequences,"" he said.
With over 28,500 migrants arriving since January 1, Italy has once again become the principal entry point for migrants arriving in Europe, following a controversial EU-Turkey deal and the closure of the Balkan route up from Greece.
In previous years, many migrants landing in Italy have headed on to other countries including Austria but Rome now fears it could be stuck hosting thousands of new arrivals.
On average 2,500 lorries and 15,000 cars travel daily through the Brenner Pass -- a crucial lifeline for Italy's exports to northern Europe that is already prone to delays even without border checks.
Austria sits at the crossroads of the two major migrant routes, from the Balkans and from Italy, and saw hundreds of thousands of migrants cross its territory in 2015.
Authorities have received around 90,000 asylum applications from people fleeing war, persecution and poverty who have opted to settle in the country.
Juncker also raised the alarm over Austria's response to the migrant crisis which he said had tempted other countries to close their borders while making far-right politics ""presentable"" elsewhere in Europe.
""What we see in Austria we have unfortunately seen in other European countries, where (political) parties play with people's fears,"" he said.
The anti-immigration candidate from Austria's far-right Freedom Party, Norbert Hofer, is the favourite to win the presidential run-off election on May 22."

					08:02 CEST+02:00				",The Local/AFP,Austria's new interior minister to stay tough on migrants,"Austria's new Interior Minister Wolfgang Sobotka said on Sunday he would stick to the hardline stance on migrants pushed by his predecessor, Johanna Mikl-Leitner.
""This course will be continued, there's no doubt about that,"" Sobotka told a press conference in Vienna. The 60-year-old, who is a newcomer to national politics, said he did not want ""any experiments"".
The pair will swap jobs later this month as part of a reshuffle within the conservative ÖVP party announced on Sunday evening.
Mikl-Leitner is set to take over Sobotka's current position as acting regional governor in her home state of Lower Austria.
""In a few days I will leave the republic's toughest job behind me and start the most beautiful role in Austria,"" Mikl-Leitner said.
The 52-year-old, who took office in 2011, has been one of the key architects behind the country's tough asylum-seeker policies, as Europe grapples with its worst migration crisis since World War II.
She has overseen the introduction of border fences, tougher frontier controls and hardline asylum rules - including an annual cap on migrant numbers - as part of her push to build ""fortress Europe"" and shut the main Balkan migrant trail for good.
With that route now closed, Mikl-Leitner recently turned her attention to the Italian border, threatening to clamp down on the strategically important Brenner pass checkpoint if Rome failed to stop illegal migrants."

					14:56 CEST+02:00				",AFP,"German Interior Minister forms 'axis' with Austria, Italy against Merkel","The hardline interior ministers of Austria, Germany and Italy have formed an ""axis of the willing"" to combat illegal immigration, Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz said Wednesday, escalating a Europe-wide row over the issue.
The announcement by Kurz in Berlin after talks with German Interior Minister Horst Seehofer marks a shot across the bow at Chancellor Angela Merkel, who is trying to pull together a deal for EU cooperation on placing asylum seekers.
Seehofer - who is locked in an open migration feud with Merkel that is threatening the stability of her coalition government - said that he and his far-right Austrian and Italian counterparts, Herbert Kickl and Matteo Salvini, had formed their alliance this week.
He said their cooperation would extend to ""issues of security and terrorism"" but did not offer specifics on what it would entail.
Kurz, whose country assumes the EU's rotating presidency on July 1st, said he welcomed the ""good cooperation that we want to develop between Rome, Vienna and Berlin"".
""I think it marks very sensible cooperation that will contribute to reducing illegal migration to Europe,"" Kurz told reporters. ""We believe an axis of the willing is needed to fight illegal migration.""
Merkel has firmly rejected a plan put forward by Seehofer to turn back at German borders any asylum seeker already registered in another EU country. She argues that her country should not go it alone while Europe searches for a common policy.
Seehofer has won support from Salvini, who on Monday flatly refused to allow a rescue vessel carrying hundreds of migrants to dock.
Despite the gulf between them, Seehofer insisted Wednesday that he was committed to striking a compromise with Merkel this week, although what shape it would take appeared completely unknown.
""We will definitely find a solution,"" he said.
Merkel was re-elected for a fourth term in September but saw her ruling majority depleted by voter unease over the influx of more than one million asylum seekers in 2015-16.
Kurz won the chancellery last year in an alliance with the far-right, vowing to tackle illegal immigration, an issue that also propelled a populist alliance to power in Italy.
The Austrian centre-right leader said in Berlin Wednesday he was counting on the backing of his tough line during his EU presidency from countries such as the Netherlands and Denmark.
Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovakia have also consistently either refused outright or resisted taking in refugees under a contested EU quota system."

					20:57 CET+01:00				", The Local,Austrian border police check freight trains from Italy,"After two migrants were crushed to death on a freight train at the beginning of December, police in Tyrol are now inspecting cargo trains crossing the border from Italy.
Officers and security guards began with searches of 10 freight trains at Steinach station, located on the Brenner pass. Police said that trains will mainly be stopped and searched at night.
The searches come after the deaths of two Eritreans in early December, who were attempting to smuggle themselves into Austria and were crushed as the freight train they were on was being unloaded.
“We avoid catastrophes on a daily basis,” said Gerald Tatzgern, head of the Austrian Interior Ministry's anti-human trafficking unit.
In the previous month, more than 90 African migrants and refugees have been intercepted by police in Tyrol, who were thought to be heading towards Germany.
According to Tyrol police spokesman Manfred Dummer, “Illegal migrants always try to scout out new ways to get north. We have reacted to this phenomenon of freight train stowaways with intensified controls.”
Austrian police want an agreement from the Italian authorities that trains will be stopped and searched immediately before they enter Austria."
