				Hundreds of Eritreans granted temporary residence in Switzerland after seeing their bid for asylum rejected have received letters in recent days telling them their status is now under review.			

	The move comes after the Federal Administrative Court ruled in August last year that it was reasonable to return Eritrean citizens who had already previously performed military service to the African country as they were unlikely either to be required to re-join the military or to face other punishment.

	Following legal requirements, the State Secretariat for Migration (SEM) is now reviewing the files of 3,200 Eritreans granted temporary residence in Switzerland with authorities stressing that people affected would have the right to a judicial hearing and that all cases would be dealt with on an individual basis.

	People who deserted during military service are not affected by the review process.

	Responding to questions from Switzerland's SDA/ATS news agency, an SEM spokesperson on Wednesday said the review did not mean that Eritreans no longer had a right to temporary residence in Switzerland.

	“Those who need protection should receive that protection in Switzerland,” the spokesperson said.

	The Federal Administrative Court initially toughened its stance against Eritrean asylum seekers in February 2017 when it slammed shut an open-door policy toward Eritreans which had automatically granted them refugee status.

	Previously, Switzerland had given Eritreans refugee status if they said they had left their country ""illegally"". But the St Gallen-based court ruled that the policy was not justified particularly given exit visas are rarely given out in the autocratic country which enforces universal military conscription.

	The Swiss Refugee Council criticized the decision to review the files of just over a third of the 9,400 Eritreans who currently hold temporary resident permits in Switzerland saying there was no indication conditions on the ground had improved in the Horn of Africa country.

	But as Swiss daily Tages Anzeiger reported on Wednesday, Switzerland cannot at this time forcibly return people to Eritrea. The country has no wish to take back citizens who have fled and there is no bilateral treaty on the matter.

	Eritreans were the largest group of asylum seekers in Switzerland with 3,375 applications coming from this group. However, that number was done 35 percent on a year earlier.

				The UN agency for Palestinian refugees is fuelling ""unrealistic"" hopes of return after 70 years of exodus and is therefore helping keep the Mideast conflict alive, Switzerland's foreign minister has said.			

	The United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) was established after the war surrounding Israel's creation in 1948, when around 700,000 Palestinians fled or were expelled.

	But Swiss Foreign Minister Ignazio Cassis pointed out that the number of Palestinian refugees living in Lebanon, Jordan, Syria, the West Bank and Gaza has swelled to more than five million.

	""It is unrealistic that this dream (of return) will be fulfilled for all,"" he said in an interview given to several German-language papers owned by the Swiss NZZ group and published on Thursday.

	""But UNRWA maintains this hope. For me, the question is whether UNRWA is part of the solution or part of the problem,"" he said, concluding that ""it is both"".

	The UN agency, he said, ""worked as a solution for a long time, but today it has become part of the problem.""

Fuelling the conflict?

	""It provides ammunition to continue the conflict. For as long as Palestinians live in refugee camps, they will want to return to their homeland,"" he said.

	""By supporting UNRWA, we are keeping the conflict alive.""

	His comments came after a month and a half of mass protests and clashes along the Gaza border, calling for Palestinian refugees to be able to return to their homes now inside Israel.

	The largest demonstrations coincided with the move of the US embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem on Monday, which saw Israeli forces kill some 60 Palestinians, pushing the overall toll well over 100. 

	UNRWA is meanwhile struggling to cover a massive budget shortfall, after major donor Washington slashed its 2018 funding.

	The administration of US President Donald Trump has opted to cut the $360 million offered in 2017 to a commitment of just $60 million this year, leaving UNRWA scrambling to raise nearly half a billion dollars to guarantee services until the end of the year.

	Switzerland is among a group of countries who together pledged about $100 million in March to help fill the shortfall.

	Despite his scepticism of the role UNRWA is playing in the Middle East, Cassis warned the sudden funding cut facing the agency posed ""a big risk"".

	""Millions of Palestinians could take to the streets,"" he said, cautioning that lacking funds could cause the breakdown of a ""machinery that provides stability"".

	""This is a risk that Switzerland cannot afford,"" he said.

	Cassis said his country would continue funding UNRWA, but he also called for a heavier focus on integrating Palestinian refugees into their host communities.

	He said for instance that ""instead of supporting UNRWA schools and hospitals, we could help the Jordanian institutions promote integration of Palestinian refugees.""

				09:46 CET+01:00			 
					09:46 CET+01:00				", The Local,Switzerland 'must make it easier' for refugees to go to university,"
				The Swiss Students' Union (VSS) is calling on the federal and cantonal authorities to change the rules to make it easier for refugees to access the Swiss university system.			

	“The right to education is a human right,” Gabriela Lüthi, a director of VSS, told the media in a press conference. “That's why study should be available to everyone who has the interest and the capabilities”.

	 

	Many refugees have pursued or finished tertiary studies in their home country before arriving in Switzerland but slip through the net when they arrive here, said project coordinator Martina von Arx.

	 

	Their foreign qualifications do not qualify them to access the Swiss job market; rather, they must pursue a recognized Swiss university course or training, she said.

	 

	However currently numerous obstacles make it difficult for young refugees to study in Switzerland. 

	 

	Universities demand that refugees speak the local language to C1 level, even though Swiss students from a different linguistic region are only required to speak the local language to the lower B1 or B2 level, said VSS in a press conference. 

	 

	Often, refugees' linguistic knowledge is not taken account when they are allocated to a canton, added von Arx – meaning a French speaker could be sent to live in a German-speaking canton. 

	 

	“That leads to problems that could have been avoided. It is crucial to change that,” she said.

	 

	What's more, social services will only fund refugees for language courses up to A2 or B1 level, and most refugees do not have the money to fund further study.

	 

	That also applies to the Swiss university entrance exam, added the VSS. If a person without the Swiss maturité (the high school diploma) wants to study here they must either have a Bachelor's or Master's degree that is recognised in Switzerland or they must pass an entrance exam equivalent to the Swiss high school diploma.

	 

	Until 2011 preparatory courses for this entrance examination were paid for by a foundation. Since its dissolution students must now take private courses which can cost up to 20,000 francs for a year's study, a sum impossible for most refugees – and many other foreign students – to pay. 

	 

	VSS is calling for publicly-funded courses to be reintroduced, saying that economics should not dictate access to education.

	 

	“Using this type of selection process in a society that needs qualified personnel and wants above all to promote lasting integration makes no sense,” said VSS project coordinator Martina von Arx.

	 

	The organization is also calling for grants to be made available for refugees to cover the costs of living whilst studying – and that those grants should be available not just to recognized refugees but to those who have provisional refugee status. 

	 

	“If our integration system isn't prepared to support refugees having already studied or having an interest in studying, we are wasting potential and missing a chance to train much needed qualified workers,” she added. 

	 

	The organization's stance was welcomed by Swiss universities, with Michael Hengartner, the rector of Zurich University and president of Swissuniversities, saying higher education institutions were currently offering different measures for potential refugee students.

	 

	Indeed, since 2015 universities have agreed in principle to accept refugees and several are offering schemes where refugees can sit in on classes, for free.

	 

	The University of Geneva's ‘Horizon Academique' scheme welcomed 35 refugee students in this way last September.

	 

	But this does not go far enough, feels VSS.

	 

	“These projects are good and especially promote linguistic education,” Lüthi told the media. “But they are not enough”.

				12 April 2017
				09:16 CEST+02:00			 
					09:16 CEST+02:00				", The Local,Afghan refugee faces deportation after 25 years in Switzerland,"
				A Swiss court has ruled that a 27-year-old Afghan man who came to Switzerland as a refugee at the age of two should be deported to Afghanistan after committing a number of crimes. 			

	Under Swiss law a refugee can be deported even after many years in Switzerland if he is deemed a threat to security or public order. 

	 

	In this case the Fribourg resident, who has spent 25 years in Switzerland and does not know his country of origin, appealed to the cantonal court after the authorities revoked his residency permit in 2015 following a number of convictions for violent behaviour. 

	 

	But last month the court rejected his appeal, Swiss media reported on Tuesday.

	 

	The man arrived in Switzerland with his family in 1992. They were granted asylum and set up home in the canton of Fribourg, according to news agencies.

	 

	As a minor, the young man was three times convicted of violent offences, behaviour that continued into adulthood and led to a three-year prison sentence in 2010.

	 

	A year after being released he reoffended and was handed another two-year sentence.

	 

	Ruling on the man's appeal against his deportation, the cantonal court said there was a high risk that he would reoffend, based on the speed of his previous reoffending, his aggressive behaviour in prison and the opinion of a psychiatrist.

	 

	The defendant said he had no relationship with Afghanistan, that he didn't know the language or the country's customs. 

	 

	The current fragile situation in Afghanistan and the fact he was from an ethnic minority also formed part of his argument against his deportation. 

	 

	However the court drew on the opinion of the Swiss migration office (SEM) which in 2015 said it found no reason to think the man would be treated inhumanely if he returned to Afghanistan, mainly because so much time had passed since the events that led to him and his family fleeing the country as refugees.

	 

	The public interest in deporting him outweighed his private interest in staying here, concluded the judges.

	 

Foreign criminals

	 

	It's not only refugees who can be deported from Switzerland for committing crimes.

	 

	This year a new law came into force which allows the deportation of any foreigner who commits a serious crime warranting at least a three-year sentence, such as murder, rape, violent acts, armed robbery and drug trafficking. 

	 

	The new measures, applicable to crimes committed after October 1st 2016, were introduced after the Swiss public approved a popular initiative on the subject in a 2010 referendum. 

	 

	However in an amendment to the text of the original initiative, the government deemed that the courts should have the power to make exceptions, if the expulsion puts the foreigner in a dangerous situation or if a reason for the person to stay outweighs the public interest for expelling them.

	 

	The amendment – heavily criticized by the anti-immigration Swiss People's Party (SVP) – aimed to protect the interests of 'secondos', those born in Switzerland but without Swiss citizenship.

	 

	In February 2016 Swiss voters rejected another SVP-led initiative that called for the automatic deportation of foreigners guilty of even minor crimes. 

	 

	If passed, the controversial proposal would have dramatically increased the number of offences that can get foreign nationals automatically kicked out of Switzerland, including crimes usually punishable with short prison sentences or fines.

	 

	It would also have removed a judge's right to make exceptions.

	 

	Opponents had warned that if the text passed, ‘secondos' risked being deported to countries they have never lived in, just for petty offences.

				For the first time Syrian asylum seekers from Greece are to be admitted to Switzerland under the European Union Relocation Programme.			

	The 30 Syrians are mainly people affected by the long-running conflict in their homeland, the Swiss news agency SDA reported.

	The Swiss government took a decision in autumn 2015 to voluntarily join the EU programme that distributes refugees from Italy and Greece to other European countries.

	Switzerland has now said it is willing to accept the first contingent of Syrians from Greece, the State Secretariat for Migration (SEM) told the agency.

	Switzerland has agreed to accept 900 asylum seekers from Italy and 600 from Greece under the programme. So far applications for 460 people have been accepted, said SEM head of information, Giery Cavelty.

	Cavelty said 120 people had already arrived in Switzerland, and more would be arriving in the coming weeks and months.

	The new arrivals have to go through the standard asylum application process once they are in Switzerland.

	The arrival of the asylum seekers from Greece was delayed because the EU had refused to pay the relocation costs, Cavelty said. Switzerland is now covering these itself.

	In spring 2015 the Swiss government agreed to take in 3,000 people from the Syrian conflict areas. The 1,500 asylum seekers covered by the EU Relocation Programme comprise half of that total.

				Nearly 100,000 people who fled Venezuela have claimed refugee status since the start of 2017, the UN said Tuesday, as it ramped up response plans for a displacement crisis likely to worsen.			

The UN refugee agency based in Geneva said the number of Venezuelans who have sought asylum has shot up 2,000 percent since 2014, but the most dramatic increases have ocurred over the last 14 months.

With the country's economic and political crisis intensifying, UNHCR has drawn up a ""regional response plan that covers eight (surrounding) countries"", spokesperson Aikatarina Kitidi said.

""In view of the situation in Venezuela, it is crucial that people are not deported or forcibly returned there,"" she added.

Asked if the UN had received reports of deportations or forced returns, Kitidi did not answer directly, saying only the  agency was calling for ""solidarity"" among nations in the region in responding to Venezuelans in need.

An influx of Venezuelans has reportedly stirred tensions in Brazil, notably in the city of Boa Vista which has received 40,000 people, raising its population by more than 10 percent.

Hundreds of Venezuelans there have been sleeping on the ground for months, while using restrooms in gas or bus stations.

UNHCR warned that an increasing number of Venezuelans, especially those living abroad without legal protection, are ""vulnerable to exploitation, trafficking, violence, sexual abuse, discrimination and xenophobia"".

The UN agency does not have a precise figure for those who have fled the crisis in Venezuela.

Regarding only those who have filed refugee claims, UNHCR said the figure stood at 145,000 since 2014 – but 94 percent of those claims have been recorded since the start of 2017.

				On Sunday October 15th Sri Lankan chef Thambithurai Sritharan, an asylum seeker in Switzerland, will take over the kitchen of the Brasserie des Halles de l'Ile in Geneva as part of the first Swiss edition of the Refugee Food Festival. 			

	Created by the Food Sweet Food association and co-organized by the UN's refugee agency, the Refugee Food Festival is a citizens' initiative offering talented refugee, asylum-seeking and provisionally admitted chefs the chance to showcase their skills and culinary heritage. 

	 

	Already staged in cities around Europe, this first Swiss edition (October 11th-15th) sees five restaurants in Geneva open their kitchens to chefs from Syria, Eritrea, Sri Lanka, Tibet and Nigeria, who will present a special menu of their own dishes for one brunch, lunch or dinner only. 

	 

	In doing so, the festival aims to change perceptions of refugees and asylum seekers and boost their chances of finding work, as well as offering local people the chance to discover cuisines from all over the world.

	 

	Sri Lankan chef Thambithurai Sritharan has worked in the food industry for 15 years and arrived in Switzerland in January 2016. 

	 

	Here, he tells The Local what taking part in the festival means to him. 

	 

Why did you want to take part in the Refugee Food Festival? 

	 

	I have been cooking for decades in various capacities. Since I arrived in Switzerland, I also like cooking for my fellows at the [asylum seeker residence] Foyer Frank-Thomas, where I am currently living – sometimes for 200 people at a time! The idea of feeding people has always driven me forward. Also during the war in Sri Lanka, where food was scarce and people were missing a lot of things. It is a way for me to make people happy, to share what I can offer.

	 

	Sri Lankan cuisine is rather complex: it involves a lot of different spices and ingredients. I am therefore very proud to be able to introduce this cooking to new people here in Geneva. They might find it a little bit too spicy at first, but all those who tasted it before ended up asking for it again!

	 

What do you hope to achieve by sharing your cooking with people in Geneva?

	 

	I am motivated by the idea of meeting new people and of making them happy by sharing my cooking. The festival also offers me a chance to demonstrate my professional skills. I always thought that people will respect you for your own behaviour – through your acts rather than your fine words. That's also the reason why I am very active at the Foyer Frank-Thomas, always trying to help others – children and elders, as well as people from other communities.

Do you think the event can help change negative perceptions of refugees?

	 

	Yes, I am convinced that it can help change people's perceptions of refugees and asylum seekers. Many people here know very little about Sri Lanka. I think one can learn a lot from others and from other communities, simply by sharing one's knowledge and by exchanging with one another. The festival therefore provides me with an opportunity to build understanding for my culture and to let people realize that we might not be that different from each other. I also want to meet the guests that will come to the Brasserie des Halles de L'Ile and answer their questions, give them information on the dishes I prepared and the country they come from.

	 

Do you hope the festival could lead to a job for you here?

	 

	Of course, I would love to find a job thanks to the festival. I'm a hard worker and cannot stay idle for very long. I've already been looking for a job in Geneva, but my N-permit and my asylum-seeker status make it rather difficult to engage in a conversation with employers. However, that's not my main motivation for participating in the festival: I'm not here for the benefits, rather for the opportunity to bring joy to other people and to share something with them.

	 

Do you like it in Switzerland?

	 

	Yes, I haven't encountered any negativity here, I feel welcome and safe in Switzerland. The strength of human rights in Swiss culture and institutions act as a guarantee for the future, notably for protecting people like me.

	 

The Refugee Food Festival is held from October 11th-15th and the programme also includes: Syrian chef Nadeem Khadem Al Jamie at the Hôtel d'Angleterre, Nigerian Timothy Desmond Eze at the Bains des Pâquis, the Eritrean street food of Fieruz Tafla at FOOUND, and Tibetan chef Dekhi Dolkar at L'Olivier de Provence. For more details and to book, visit the festival website.

	But with Sea-Watch ships impounded and the Moonbird grounded, rescue missions were no longer possible, the NGO said.

	""The consequences of this ban on flights should be clear to those politically responsible. The people on those boats won’t be rescued but will instead drown out of sight,"" said HBI pilot and founder Fabio Zgraggen, who is from the eastern Swiss region of Appenzell.

	The Moonbird operated in the area north of the Libyan coast for two years without problems before missions were grounded, according to Zgraggen.

	He told Swiss news site Watson that Maltese authorities had blocked HPI rescue flights because there had been no request from Malta or Italy for those operations to go ahead.

	But the 33-year-old said no permit was required to operate private rescue flights.

	Zgraggen said a lawyer had been taken on and the plan was to get flights back in the air as soon as possible.

	The Moonbird ban comes as Italy and Malta ramp up efforts to stop NGOs from using the island nation of Malta as a base of operations for the rescue of refugees off the Libyan coast. Italy's interior minister has also said that Italian ports will be closed ""all summer"" to NGO migrant rescue boats.

	After a recent EU summit on immigration, the European Council appeared to back Italy and “other frontline Member States” in the fight against people smuggling.

	“All vessels operating in the Mediterranean must respect the applicable laws and not obstruct operations of the Libyan Coastguard,” said the European Council in a statement.

				Switzerland has sent five experts from Swiss Humanitarian Aid (SHA) to Slovenia and Croatia to help local organizations deal with the refugee crisis, the federal government has announced.			

	In a statement published on Monday, the Swiss foreign office said the SHA personnel were despatched to the region on November 12th after Slovenia and Croatia applied to Switzerland for help at the end of October.

	Comprising some 700 people, the SHA is a humanitarian aid corps which is available for direct actions and secondments to international organizations.

	The Swiss team will aim to share their expertise and help adapt the existing infrastructure in Slovenia and Croatia to the winter conditions.

	The most pressing needs identified by the SHA in the region are better winter infrastructure and sanitation facilities, more translators and support services for volunteers.

	The SHA is currently working in the Šentilj transit centre on the Austrian-Slovenian border and will extend their activities to Croatia in the coming days, said the statement.   

	Between 4,000 and 7,000 people are crossing into Croatia and Slovenia every day, fleeing war in Syria, Iraq and elsewhere.

	Switzerland has already provided 1.5 million francs to countries including Serbia and Macedonia in response to calls from the UN's refugee agency, UNHCR.

	However the country's main efforts regarding the refugee crisis have been in the conflict zone itself, with a total of 203 million francs given to projects in Syria, Lebanon, Jordan and Iraq since March 2011, said the statement.

	As for the situation in Switzerland itself, while it is now expecting to exceed the figure of 29,000 refugees initially predicted to arrive here in 2015, the country is still receiving far fewer migrants than the rest of Europe.

	According to the UNHCR more than 800,000 people have arrived in Europe during the crisis and 15 million have fled across the Middle East.

	The Geneva-based agency has launched  a winter crisis appeal to help refugee families facing the cold months ahead.

	After mild weather across much of Europe during November, temperatures are set to drop this coming weekend.

				Switzerland has slammed shut its open-door policy toward Eritreans which had automatically granted them refugee status.			

	In announcing its decision on Thursday, the Swiss federal administrative court in St Gallen said the lax policy was unjustified. It had also been criticized by several Swiss politicians who claimed it was being abused.

	 

	To qualify as a refugee upon arrival in Switzerland, Eritreans simply needed to say that they had left their country ""illegally"".

	 

	That description could feasibly apply to anyone who flees the Horn of Africa nation, where an autocratic government enforces universal military conscription and requires citizens to secure exit visas before travel, which are rarely given out.

	 

	After a review of the policy, the court ruled that ""the illegal exit from (Eritrea) cannot in itself justify recognition as a refugee"".

	 

	The court cited several cases where Eritreans had been granted asylum in Switzerland but later returned to Eritrea for short visits.

	 

	According to the court, those cases proved that Eritreans who left their country illegally were not necessarily subject to mistreatment upon their return, undermining their claim to asylum.

	 

	In June, a UN-backed investigation said the Asmara regime led by president Isaias Afwerki's had ""enslaved"" 400,000 people.

	 

	The United Nations had also previously reported that 5,000 Eritreans risk their lives each month to flee the nation where army conscription can last decades.

	 

	Eritreans topped the list of asylum seekers in Switzerland last year, with 5,178 requests lodged, according to the Swiss migration office. More than 42 percent of them were granted asylum. 

	 

	Eritreans are the largest diaspora of refugees in Switzerland, at around 34,500.

	 

	The federal court ruling, which was made on Monday but publicly released on Thursday, cannot be appealed.

				Switzerland is not a ""preferred destination"" of Syrian refugees, says its migration office, with new figures showing just 401 Syrians applied for asylum in the Alpine country in August. 			

	New figures released by the Swiss Migration Office (SEM) show that a total of 3,899 asylum requests were placed last month, just three more than in July and hardly the influx experienced by other European countries.

	Of the Swiss total, 1,610 requests came from Eritreans, 461 from Afghans, 401 from Syrians and 180 from Iraqis.

	Releasing the figures in a statement on Monday the SEM said: “Switzerland is not a preferred destination country of migrants, which explains why the rise in the number of asylum requests is modest compared to that observed in Europe as a whole.”

	Speaking to the newspaper Tribune de Genève on Tuesday, Amnesty International asylum coordinator Denise Graf said the lack of Syrian enthusiasm for Switzerland may be due to the modest size of the existing Syrian population in the country.

	“The Syrian community is very small in Switzerland compared with the Eritrean community,” she said.

	“We notice a bigger influx of refugees when the Diaspora is already large.”

	Latest figures show just over 5,000 Syrian refugees have been given provisional permission to live in Switzerland while a further 2,000 are currently having their asylum applications reviewed.

	By contrast some 20,000 Eritreans have been welcomed into Switzerland in recent years, forming the largest such group outside the North African country itself.

	Another reason for the relatively low number of Syrian asylum seekers arriving in Switzerland is the alpine nation's stricter asylum policy compared to elsewhere in Europe, added Graf.

	“In Sweden, the rate of acceptance of Syrian refugees is 100 percent. In Switzerland it's around 35 percent, the others being given only provisional admission, which isn't satisfactory.”

Red tape hold-ups

	Back in March the federal council set a quota to accept 3,000 Syrian refugees over three years, and current president Simonetta Sommaruga has long said Switzerland would participate in any EU agreement on refugee quotas.

	But in actual fact the processing system is sluggish, says the Tribune de Genève.

	“The HCR [UN refugee agency] gave 300 files over to the SEM and it is currently examining them,” Graf told the paper.

	“Every three weeks it accepts a quota of around 30 people, particularly the vulnerable. It's certainly a positive step, but it takes time.

	A further 1,000 places are reserved for the close relatives of Syrians already in Switzerland, she said, but again bureaucracy is holding the scheme back.

	“The definition is so strict that only the husband or wife and under-age children can come,” said Graf.

	Politicians in the country are divided on the issue.

	Green politician Ueli Leuenberger told the paper that these bureaucratic hold-ups were “scandalous”.

	“I know that there are plenty of reasons for this slowness. But we have to get past bureaucracy and move forward, especially since winter is coming.

	“We must extend the chance for families to be together,” he said, adding that current rules mean a girl of 19 can't even come to Switzerland with her parents.

	Christian Democrat Christophe Darbellay agreed that quotas should be filled more quickly.

	“We have to work faster, but also remain attentive. Bringing jihadists in would be the worst thing,” he told the paper.

	“Migrants are coming. We should expect an increase. Switzerland must do its part by partnering with Europe to take its share.”

	But other are taking a less proactive stance.

	“If Syrians don't want to come to Switzerland, we shouldn't go and get them,” Swiss People's Party councillor Hans Fehr told the Tribune.

	“But it makes sense to strengthen on-site aid and to fight against smugglers,” he added.

	In total, in the first eight months of this year Switzerland received 19,668 asylum requests from all nationalities.

	That's expected to rise to around 30,000 by the end of the year, a sharp increase on the 23,765 asylum requests placed last year, which was already an 11 percent rise on 2013 figures.

	Of the 2,095 asylum requests processed in August, Switzerland granted asylum to 462 people and gave a further 584 provisional admission, said the SEM.

	It also rejected 649 people under the Dublin convention, which specifies that people should apply for asylum in the first EU country they enter.

	The number of pending applications in Switzerland rose by 1,922 to 19,207.

	EU member states registered 550,000 asylum requests from January to July 2015, compared with 304,000 during the same period last year.

				Moved by the tragic images in recent days of the plight of Syrian refugees fleeing to Europe, some expats in Switzerland are taking matters into their own hands to try and help, finds The Local.			

	As Swiss aid organization Caritas Schweiz calls for the Swiss federal government to double the amount of aid pledged to the refugee crisis in Europe, private individuals in Switzerland are donating clothes, organizing collections and doing their part to help stricken migrants.

	On Thursday 33-year-old Anila Hussain, originally from Pakistan, who lives with her family in Gland, in the canton of Vaud, decided with friend Navine Eldesouki to start collecting items to help refugees in Switzerland after seeing the heartbreaking image of three-year-old Aylan Kurdi, who died trying to reach Turkey.

	“I just saw the news and the picture that's highlighted all over the world about this little boy. I think that provoked a lot of people and personally me as well. Being a mother, it's painful,” Hussain told The Local.

	“Yesterday morning we decided to just stand up ourselves and do something rather than depending on the politicians to do something.”

	Hussain and Eldesouki are collecting winter clothes for adults and children that will be delivered on Saturday to a refugee centre in Sion in the canton of Valais.

	“We are just trying to do a little something for them, it's nothing special,” she said.

	“I'm not Syrian, I have no connection with Syria; it's only as a human being I am doing that for another human being.”

	Hussain says she has received so many donations already that they won't send everything to Sion but may keep some back for a future delivery to Germany.

	“We are only sending the things they need right now, not to overwhelm them too much.”

Calais collection

	Meanwhile Rachel Wise, a New Zealander who has lived in Switzerland for 10 years, is gathering clothes and practical items to take to refugees in Calais.

	“My husband and I are driving up to the UK next week with an empty van so I thought on our way we could drop off some much needed supplies in Calais,” she tells The Local.

	“I have felt moved and completely helpless reading about events in Africa and the Middle East and the lengths ordinary people are going to to escape their desperate situation there,” she says.

	“I want to help and I think dropping some supplies to those who have made it as far as Calais (to then just wait in these awful camps) is the least I could do.”

	Like Hussain, Wise has been inundated with donations.

	“I put a note up on my Facebook page yesterday afternoon, thinking a few friends might drop some things off. Since then I have been totally overwhelmed with the response I received,” she tells The Local.

	“It goes to show the reach of social media, but more importantly, it's fantastic how many people want to help. It seems opinion has changed across Europe and more people think we could do more to help.”

	Swiss aid organization Caritas Schweiz recognized the “private acts of solidarity with the migrants and those who generously support emergency aid and Swiss relief efforts”.

	In a statement published earlier this week the organization called for the Swiss government to increase its aid budget to “at least 100 million francs” to help Syrian refugees across the Middle East and Europe.

	The recent rise from 30 to 50 million francs a year is “far too modest given the size of this humanitarian catastrophe,” it said.

	It added: “From right to left on the political spectrum, parties continue to stress that they think providing aid in the countries affected is correct and urgent. It is certainly time to translate these fine words into deeds.”

	Switzerland expects to receive 30,000 asylum requests this year, which, though a significant increase on previous years, is far from the numbers experienced elsewhere in Europe, stressed Caritas.

	“Contrary to what certain politicians are saying, we are not talking about asylum chaos.”

	Nevertheless, asylum centres across the country are at capacity, causing some cantons to erect temporary tents to house some migrants.

How to help

	As well as making financial donations to charities supporting refugees, Caritas advises a number of ways that Swiss residents can offer practical help.

	Individuals can offer up their spare room to house migrants through programmes including the Swiss Organization for the Help of Refugees and the Wegeleben project.

	People can also donate clothes to Caritas for distribution to refugees within Switzerland, or give money to support their work with refugees in the Middle East.

	Baby clothes and supplies, winter clothes, shoes and linen are particularly sought.

	But the “most important” says Caritas, is that people engage within their community to make refugees feel welcome.

	“Make contact with people. Have civic courage. Counter xenophobia.”

					16:11 CET+01:00				", The Local,Revealed: Switzerland already strips refugees of cash ,"
				As Denmark faces a barrage of criticism over its controversial plan to seize refugees' valuables, Switzerland has already been following this practice for years, Swiss authorities said on Friday.			

	Swiss asylum law has since the 1990s required asylum seekers to contribute to the costs of hosting them in the wealthy Alpine country.

	The country is permitted to confiscate from people seeking asylum in the country amounts over 1,000 Swiss francs ($995, €913 euros), Celine Kohlprath, a spokeswoman for Swiss migration authorities, told the AFP news agency.

	Her statement confirmed information revealed in a debate programme on the public SRF channel Thursday.

	""This practice is based on the fact that Switzerland (wants) people arriving in Switzerland to contribute as far as possible to the costs of the asylum process and the social assistance provided,"" she wrote in an email.

	An information notice given to asylum seekers on arrival was displayed on Thursday's ""10 vor 10"" debate programme, stating: ""If you have . . . more than 1,000 Swiss francs when you arrive at the reception centre, you must hand them over against a receipt.""

	Kohlprath stressed that ""in practice, the person must have at least 1,500 Swiss francs in their pocket"" before any cash is confiscated.

	The Swiss law also differs from the bill being debated by the Danish parliament in that it does not allow for material goods to be taken, she said.

	The Danish proposal would allow Danish authorities to seize asylum seekers' cash exceeding 10,000 kroner (€1,340 euros, $1,450), as well as any individual items valued at more than 10,000 kroner.

	Kohlprath's colleague Lea Wertheimer also told Thursday's programme that ""if a person leaves of their own accord within seven months, they can retrieve their money and take it with them.""

Unfair

	A Syrian refugee invited to speak on the programme meanwhile showed a receipt he allegedly received from Swiss authorities in exchange for the money he had left over after paying off traffickers to get him and his family to Switzerland.

	The married father of three insisted the law was ""unfair"".

	Swiss law also requires refugees permitted to reside and work in the country to hand over ten percent of their earnings over a ten-year-period, or up to 15,000 Swiss francs in total, to help cover the costs of their asylum process.

	Stefan Frey of the Swiss Refugee Council lashed out against the measure, telling Thursday's programme it was ""disgraceful"".

	The UN refugee agency, which has condemned the bill being debated by the Danish parliament cautioning it will fuel xenophobia, meanwhile said on Friday it had previously raised concerns about the Swiss law with authorities.

	""UNHCR has drawn attention to the fact that, having to contribute a part of their salary, could be an obstacle to accessing the labour market and to the integration of asylum seekers and persons with recognized protection needs,"" spokesman William Spindler told AFP in an email.

	""There is a new legislative proposal to abolish this provision and we would very much hope it will be adopted.""

					11:35 CET+01:00				", The Local,Refugees in Switzerland lack the psychological care they need,"
				Switzerland doesn't offer enough psychological support to refugees who have experienced traumatic events before arriving in the country, according to a report in Swiss media.			

	According to estimates, half of all refugees arriving in Switzerland suffer from post-traumatic stress, reports news agency ATS.

	 

	But it takes on average eight years after their arrival to start treatment, according to Matthis Schick, director of a Zurich organization helping victims of war and torture.

	 

	Many trauma victims don't want to talk about their experiences because they don't want to relive them, or because they feel shame or guilt, particularly regarding rape and sexual assault.

	 

	But even when they do want to speak, Switzerland doesn't have enough places available to treat them. 

	 

	A 2013 study commissioned by the Swiss government found that the country lacked some 500 therapy places for refugees with psychological troubles.

	 

	Wait lists are therefore very long, with some having to wait up to a year to be seen. 

	 

	The language barrier is also a major obstacle for people seeking treatment, according to Schick. Interpreters are often needed, but that's a resource care-providers don't always have and victims can't always pay for. 

	 

	His Zurich clinic is lucky to have its own interpreting service, but others don't, and health insurance companies are not obliged to cover the costs.

	 

	Consequently, some patients resort to amateur interpreters or their own children, sometimes leading to errors. 

	 

	“A translation mistake drove a woman to abort her child without wanting to,” said Schick.

	 

	In refusing to pay for professional interpreters the authorities are being short-sighted, he added, since not treating trauma victims can lead to bigger health problems down the line.

				A border guard in Switzerland has been convicted of charges relating to the stillbirth of a baby born to a refugee who was sent back to Italy. 			

	A military court on Wednesday convicted the guard of causing bodily harm through negligence, attempting to abort a pregnancy and repeatedly failing in his duties, reported news agency ATS.

	 

	The guard received a six month prison sentence and a fine, both suspended.

	 

	The case dates back to July 2014 when a family of Syrian refugees were attempting to travel to France from Italy on a train through Switzerland.

	 

	Among the group was a 22-year-old woman who was seven months pregnant. 

	 

	After being stopped at a Franco-Swiss border point, they were loaded into buses by border guards and ordered back to Italy. On the return journey, the woman began to bleed, but despite repeated calls for help, Swiss authorities did not respond, according to her husband. 

	 

	He claimed they and their two-year-old son were then detained in a “cell” at Brig station for four hours with no medical assistance, Swiss media reported at the time.

	 

	They were subsequently put on a train from Brig to the Italian border town of Domodossola, where the woman was hospitalized, but her baby was later stillborn.

	 

	The prosecution demanded a prison sentence of up to seven years for the border guard, saying he “lacked all humanity”.

	""We are here to address the biggest refugee and displacement crisis of our time,"" Ban told the conference in Geneva. ""This demands an exponential increase in global solidarity.""
	   
	The UN secretary general, a South Korean, recalled his own experience of fleeing his village with his family as a six-year-old during the Korean War sixty years ago and said that for him stories of refugees stranded in camps with meagre resources ""have personal meaning.""
	   
	""Attempts to demonise (refugees) are not only offensive; they are factually incorrect,"" Ban said, in an apparent reference to rising anti-migrant rhetoric increasingly being voiced by some political leaders across the developed world.
	   
	The Geneva meet follows a conference in London in February where nations pledged $11 billion (9.7 billion euros) to help manage one of the largest displacements of people since World War Two.
	   
	The United Nations refugee agency (UNHCR) estimates that 4.8 million Syrians have been forced to flee the country during its five-year civil war, while another 6.6 million people have been internally displaced.
	   
	The aim of the Geneva meet is to secure relocation pledges for 10 percent of Syria's refugees, or 480,000 people, within three years.
	   
	The UN wants that number of people moved outside of Syria's neighbours, which are currently absorbing nearly the entire refugee burden.
	   
	Ban said the 480,000 figure was ""a relatively small number,"" compared with those being hosted by Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey.
	   
	The conference comes as the UN continues to blast a deal agreed between Turkey and the European Union earlier this month which calls for migrants who cross the Mediterranean seeking a life in Europe to be returned to Turkey.
	   
	The UN's refugee agency and rights office have condemned the deal as possibly illegal in that it appears to deny some migrants their legal right to asylum.
	   
	More than one million migrants -- about half of them Syrians -- reached Europe via the Mediterranean last year, a rate of arrivals that has continued through the first three months of 2016.
	   
	Thousands have died making the harrowing journey, often on rickety boats run by people smugglers.
	   
	Some European states have temporarily shut borders and called for tough measures to stem the movement of people through the continent.
	   
	The UN and civil society groups have urged Europe's leaders to develop coherent and organised resettlement systems, to make migration to the continent safer and less chaotic.

				Refugees settled in the Swiss Jura can volunteer to undertake unpaid farming work this summer as part of a pilot programme aiming to help them integrate.			

	The Jura association for the reception of migrants (AJAM) has teamed up with the canton's agriculture authorities to offer the voluntary programme over the summer months, from June to October.

	Tasks, limited to manual labour, will involve weeding, pest control and general farm assistance, the association said in a statement.

	Volunteers won't be paid but will receive an “integration supplement” provided by the farmer as part of their overall welfare allowance.

	Currently 880 recognized refugees have been granted or are awaiting a residency B permit in the canton of Jura, while a further 170 asylum seekers have been granted temporary residency there and cannot be sent back to their home country, according to AJAM.

	“Nearly 90 percent of these people will settle permanently in Switzerland,” it said.

	“It is often very difficult for these people to find new purpose in their lives and to integrate in our community.”

	Farm work is one of several ideas AJAM is proposing to help them integrate.

	The association will monitor the administration of the programme, while in return “the farmers will oversee the social integration of the refugees by boosting their language knowledge”.

	The association is “looking forward to this win-win partnership serving both integration and the environment,” it added.

	Speaking last year AJAM said the people of the Jura had been particularly welcoming to migrants, and that it had received “numerous spontaneous offers aimed at welcoming migrants, offering them shelter or goods or helping them to integrate into Jura society,” it said in a September statement.  

	According to the latest figures from the federal migration office (SEM), 1,748 asylum requests were placed in Switzerland in April, 224 fewer than the previous month, continuing an overall downward trend seen since last December.

	Most asylum requests come from Eritreans, Gambians, Somalis, Syrians, Afghans and Moroccans.  

	On June 5th the Swiss people will vote on a government-backed initiative aimed at speeding up the asylum process in Switzerland, which would bring “substantial savings in the medium and long term”, says the SEM.

around a dozen African men and herding them into a nearby hall.			

	Between 30 and 150 migrants and refugees are intercepted each day at the train station in the small southern Swiss town of Chiasso.
	   
	The numbers pale in comparison to the waves of migrants and refugees taking the perilous Mediterranean route to Greece and on up through the Balkans towards more hospitable countries in northern Europe.
	   
	But this lazy border town in Switzerland's Italian-speaking Ticino region is bracing for an expected influx as crowds of migrants try to navigate a growing number of closed borders in the east and as the number of possible routes dwindles.
	   
	""At the moment, everything is under control, the situation is stable, but tomorrow that could change,"" said Patrick Benz, head of the Swiss border guards' migration unit.

Thousands per day?

	Norman Gobbi, head of Ticino's regional government and member of the populist rightwing Lega dei Ticinesi party, meanwhile said border closures and tighter border controls elsewhere could easily push large numbers towards Switzerland.
	   
	""We are in the process of planning for possibly managing thousands of arrivals per day,"" he told AFP in his office in the regional capital Bellinzona.
	   
	Switzerland, which has already taken in some 9,000 Syrians since the conflict there exploded in March 2011, last week agreed to take in 1,500 of the 40,000 asylum seekers European countries want resettled from overstretched Greece and Italy.
	   
	Not many Syrians are crossing into Chiasso for the time being, however.
	   
	Most arriving here, by train, car or on foot, are from a range of African countries and have first travelled to Libya before attempting the perilous Mediterranean crossing to Italy.
	   
	While they so far make up only a fraction of the over half million migrants who have arrived in Europe this year, their numbers are climbing.
	   
	Between June and August, around 5,000 crossed the border into the town of just 8,000 inhabitants — more than double the number during the same period last year.
	   
	Chiasso, which historically has served as the main migrant gateway to Switzerland, has withstood greater numbers in the past, with hundreds crossing each day during the Balkan war in the 1990s.
	   
	But the current rise is wearing on both the Swiss population and asylum seekers already in the town who are facing growing anti-immigrant sentiment.
	   
	""You can feel it,"" said former Ethiopian government regulator Melekot Woldemichael, who has been waiting in Chiasso for five years for a decision on his asylum application.
	   
	But, the 53-year-old insisted, ""it's natural . . . they are afraid for their own security, so even if they say anti-immigrant feelings, you have to understand them — I'm not saying that they're right.""

 At sea for 23 days

	Chiasso mayor Moreno Colombo, meanwhile, stressed the need to prepare for a surge in arrivals ""while the situation is calm"", and said the town had asked for more border guards.
	   
	Some reinforcements have already arrived.
	   
	At the Chiasso station, a guard sent from Switzerland's German-speaking region, wearing a buzz-cut, steel-rimmed glasses and blue plastic gloves, questioned the Eritreans and Gambians pulled off the latest train from Milan.
	   
	""Why have you come? Do you know where you are?"" he asked, over-enunciating to make himself understood.
	   
	The men and boys looked dazed as they were finger-printed and given bright yellow bracelets with new ID numbers.
	   
	They were also asked if they wished to seek asylum.
	   
	It's a crucial question: If they says yes, they can remain in Switzerland while the application is processed, but if they instead want to go elsewhere in Europe they will be sent back to Italy.
	   
	That is because Switzerland, while not part of the European Union, has agreed to the Dublin Regulation, under which asylum claims must be processed by the first European country refugees arrive in.
	   
	A Somali woman, clutching a six-month-old baby still sick after spending 23 days at sea in the Mediterranean listened intently as the guards explained what would happen once her asylum application had been filed.
	   
	The pair would be taken to the registration centre in Chiasso for medical examinations and then to an asylum centre elsewhere in Switzerland.
	   
	After she had been gently led off, one of the guards sighed heavily.
	   
	""I'm conflicted — the large numbers arriving means problems for Switzerland,"" he said.
	   
	""But it's so tough to hear their stories and try to imagine what I might do in their situation.""

	The agencies, which offer frontline assistance to millions of would-be migrants and asylum seekers, hailed the US resettlement programme as ""one of the most important in the world.

	   

	""The longstanding policy has offered a double win: first by rescuing some of the most vulnerable people in the world, and second by enabling them to enrich their new societies. The contribution of refugees and migrants to their new homes worldwide has been overwhelmingly positive.""

	""We strongly believe that refugees should receive equal treatment for protection and assistance, and opportunities for resettlement, regardless of their religion, nationality or race.""

	   

	Trump's decree suspends the entire US refugee resettlement program for at least 120 days while tough new vetting rules are established to confirm asylum seekers do not pose a security threat.

	   

	In addition, it specifically bars Syrian refugees from the United States indefinitely, or until the president himself decides that they no longer pose a threat.

	 

	And it slaps 90-day bans on the issuance of visas for migrants and visitors from seven mainly-Muslim countries: Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen.

	But on March 1st the Swiss government refused his application to stay, revoking his refugee status and saying he must leave for France under the terms of the Dublin agreement, which dictates that refugees must apply for asylum in the European country they first arrived in.

	The decision has dismayed Photojournalists Switzerland, an association that has been helping Karim since his arrival in Switzerland.

	 “I met him in Switzerland, in December,” Laurent Gilliéron, a photographer for agency Keystone and member of Photojournalists Switzerland tells The Local.

	“I saw his story in Le Temps and it really moved me. I got in contact and we went from there.”

	With the help of the canton of Vaud's refugee aid group EVAM, the photographers helped Karim find lodgings and establish himself in Switzerland.

	“He had the chance to work with us, to make something of a life; he is surrounded by photographers, with people who put him up,” says Gilliéron.

	“I think it's a shame that he can't stay in Switzerland. With everything around him he would have had the chance to take steps forward.”

	Despite being embraced by the photography community here, Karim's application to stay was last week refused by the federal government and he currently awaits a date to leave.

	 “It's a loss for Switzerland and also a loss of his viewpoint,” adds Gilliéron, who feels there would be a benefit to the country for Karim to stay.

	“The current migration crisis is affecting Switzerland – a lot less than other countries but still it does affect Switzerland – and it's very difficult to document.

	""The press employ people like me to document the situation but I can only spend an hour or two in a refugee shelter, for example. He can show the viewpoint of a refugee. I think that's very interesting.”

	After a failed appeal, there is little they can do now to help Karim to stay.

	“He still thinks that he will be able to stay in Switzerland. Even though we've explained to him. I think that he is refusing the truth a bit. That's visibly the case for lots of refugees,” Gilliéron tells The Local.

	However in an attempt to draw attention to his situation and his work, Photojournalists Switzerland is staging an exhibition of his photos in Lausanne on March 9th.

	And they have also re-equipped him with a camera, having sold his own to fund his journey here.

	“We wanted that at least he will leave with the equipment that he had before,” says Gilliéron.

				Swiss authorities are being investigated for the alleged mistreatment of a pregnant Syrian refugee passing through Switzerland whose baby was subsequently stillborn. 			
  The 22-year-old woman, who was seven months pregnant, was travelling with her husband and other Syrian refugees on a train from Milan to Paris, when they were ordered to return to Italy by Swiss border guards, reported broadcaster SRF during its 10vor10 programme on Wednesday.   On the return journey, the woman began to bleed, but despite repeated calls for help, Swiss authorities did not respond, her husband told the programme.   The man claimed the couple and their two-year-old son were then detained in a “cell” at Brig station for four hours with no medical assistance, according to Swiss media.   When the man asked repeatedly for help he was told to “shut up”.   They were subsequently sent back to the Italian border town of Domodossola, where they had started their journey.   Once there, the woman was hospitalized, but her baby was later stillborn.   “I thought that Switzerland was a civilized country,” the man told newspaper 20 Minutes.   “We were fleeing death and war; we were just looking for hospitality. But my rights have been trampled on, as well as the rights of my wife and this little girl who couldn’t be born.”
  Talking to SRF an Italian doctor criticized the Swiss authorities.   “If the woman had received help in Switzerland this tragedy could have been avoided,” he said.   Swiss border guards boss Jürg Noth has opened an investigation into the incident, saying that during their return journey from Vallorbe to Domodossola the refugees were the responsibility of Swiss authorities.   The exact involvement of Swiss officials in the incident should be clarified immediately, he added.   Lawyers for the family are taking legal advice, reports 20 Minutes, and hope to approach the European Court of Human Rights. "

				The number of refugees trying to enter Germany through Switzerland has risen significantly in 2016, with the government reacting by increasing its border presence, according to reports.			

	Citing German police figures, the Neue Zürcher Zeitung reports that a total of 3,385 asylum seekers have tried to enter Germany through Switzerland since the start of the year.

	In response, the German Interior Ministry has placed an extra 90 border guards and 40 federal police officers on the border, Swiss finance minister Ueli Maurer told NZZ am Sonntag.

	The Interior Ministry in Berlin confirmed that the number of refugee arrivals through Switzerland had risen, but added that on a daily basis fewer than 50 people were arriving.

	NZZ reports that when refugee accommodation centres become overcrowded in places like Chiasso along the Italian border, authorities will transfer asylum seekers to centres in Basel or Kreuzlingen -- both of which are very close to the German border, and thus some may illegally cross into Germany.

	“The development exists in connection with the still meaningful Mediterranean migrant route to Italy,” a spokesperson said.

	The Interior Ministry spokesperson said that federal police are taking measures on the Swiss border “like the border controls which have been re-instituted on the Austrian border which are there to deter or prevent entry”.

	According to Frontex, the agency that is responsible for controlling the borders of the EU, around 95,000 refugees have landed in Italy so far this year. In July alone 25,300 arrived, a 12 percent increase on last year.

	Recently released figures show that Germany is turning away far more refugees at the border in 2016 than it did in 2015.

	Up until the end of June border police stopped 13,324 people from entering the country, whereas in the whole of 2015 they prevented 8,913 from crossing the border.

	Members of Die Linke (Left Party) in Germany have described the increase in turnbacks at the border as irresponsible.

	""An inhumane mass-deportation practice has become increasingly established in Germany,"" Ulla Jelpke, MP for Die Linke, said in a statement.

	Switzerland has also come under fire in recent weeks for turning back migrants at the Swiss-Italian border if they do not lodge an asylum request in Switzerland.

	The country doesn't want to become a transit route for refugees who wish to travel through Switzerland and claim asylum in Germany instead.

	The experiment, a workshop titled 'A Day in the Life of a Refugee' took place in the basement level of a luxury hotel but aimed to recreate the unsettling and frightening experience of fleeing one's country. To help with the role play, participants were given a new name and identity.

	The simulation included filling out identity papers, bargaining for food using their valuables (watches, mobile phones and jewellery) and receiving orders from soldiers - some of whom were played by former refugees.



	Uniformed and bearing fake weapons, the soldiers shouted at the participants. According to Blick, which had a reporter on the scene, one of them yelled ""You're nothing, you're shit, I don't care if you die"".

	Suzan G. LeVine, the US Ambassador to Switzerland, took to Facebook to praise the experience. ""The program is designed to give people a tiny taste of what many of the 60 million refugees are experiencing on a daily basis,"" she said. ""They had us use ID cards, cover our hair (for women), experience abuse, endure sensory overload, feel humiliated, and more.""


Ambassador Suzan G. LeVine speaks to one of the people behind A Day in the Life of a Refugee.

	Some of the participants were reportedly moved to tears by the experience, and organizers Crossroads Foundation said ""Halfway through the week, we're already seeing many, many people leave resolved to help. Participants are finding that the emotional connection with the crisis is far more lasting than data and rhetoric"".

	Crossroads Foundation explained the goal of the project: ""It's an intense experience being thrust into the shoes of a refugee, even just for 75 minutes. Dead bodies, gunfire and orders shouted in foreign languages can unsettle participants, and lead to a deeper empathy of the challenges of real refugees.""

				The city of Zurich plans to house asylum seekers in 62 chipboard huts to replace Ikea refugee shelters that it rejected last week after they failed a fire test.			

	The chipboard structures will be assembled by employees of a local company between now and New Year's Day to house up to 250 people, the city announced on Tuesday.

	Last Friday, Zurich city councillor Raphael Golta unveiled a large hall filled with dozens of Ikea ready-to-assemble Ikea shelters.

	But just a few hours later authorities were forced to announce that the partly plastic shelters did not live up to Swiss fire protection requirements following a safety test.

	The city scrambled over the weekend to find replacements for the Ikea shelters, which cost 1,200 francs apiece. 

	The wood replacements will cost more than three times as much — 3,800 francs ($3,000) each, including labour costs, the city's social welfare department (ADF) said in a news release.

	The huts, which meet Swiss fire safety requirements, will be erected in Hall 9 at Zurich-Oerlikon, where a transition centre for asylum seekers is set to open on January 4th, the department said.

	The units with 17.5 square metres of floor space can be assembled in about an hour, ADF said.

	They will be erected on the same wooden bases used for the Ikea shelters and have the same mass so will be furnished in the same way as initially planned, the department said.

	The fate of the Ikea “Better Shelters” remains unclear.

	The city said that various people have offered to buy them but due to the poor fire test results resale has been waived.

	The canton of Aargau, which planned to use 200 Ikea shelters for an emergency asylum seeker centre, has cancelled the project because of the Zurich fire test results.

	The shelters were developed by Ikea, the Swedish furniture and furnishings chain, in conjunction with the UN High Commission for Refugees.

	AFP reported that they have been used by the thousands in refugee camps and in countries like Greece that are facing a heavy influx of immigrants.

	The city of Zurich said it had relied on safety information from the UNHCR and a Swedish study.

	But the city had requested a new test after learning that a German report last week raised concerns about the accuracy of the Swedish study.

	UNHCR spokeswoman Anja Klug told Swiss news agency ATS on Friday that the organization was preparing to compare the Swiss and Swedish safety test results.

	Switzerland is expecting to receive 39,000 asylum applicants this year, up from 23,800 in 2014.

					10:40 CEST+02:00				", The Local,Refugee aid group decries 'confusion' at Swiss border,"
				A Swiss aid organization has criticized the situation at the Swiss-Italian border, saying many refugees are left in “confusion and uncertainty”.			

	Miriam Behrens, director of the Swiss Refugee Council (SFH), travelled to the border at Chiasso and to the Italian city of Como on Wednesday and Thursday to assess the situation of refugees and “ensure that the rights of people looking for protection are entirely guaranteed,” she said in a statement.

	Switzerland has been under fire for several weeks after turning back thousands of migrants from the Swiss border.

	Any refugee has the right to claim asylum when they reach Switzerland. If they do, they should be registered with the Swiss migration office (SEM) and their application processed in due course. If they do not, because they want to transit through Switzerland and claim asylum in another country such as Germany, the terms of the Dublin agreement state they should be sent back to the first EU country they arrived in, in this case Italy.

	In July alone over 3,000 people were sent back from Switzerland to Italy, news agencies said last week.

	The Swiss border guards office says it is simply applying the law. However the situation has caused chaos in Como, where many refugees are now sleeping at the train station and in parks after being turned back.

	Last week Amnesty International called for clarification from the Swiss after reports that children were being sent back from the border.

	Now the SFH says confusion at the border is making it difficult for people to claim asylum.

	“People who seek protection are not being sufficiently and correctly informed, which leads to confusion regarding exactly when they can lodge their asylum request,” it said in a statement.

	“The situation is difficult for all parties concerned,” it added, saying there should be “more transparency” regarding the procedures in place and the asylum process.

	It said Swiss border guards “need much more help” in terms of translators and child protection specialists in order to properly deal with those seeking to place an asylum request.

	All those who wish to seek asylum in Switzerland should be put into the care of the SEM “even if there are doubts regarding their motives for seeking asylum”, it added.

	While the number of people requesting asylum has gone down across the Schengen zone since last year, its member states do not have a satisfactory solution to the question of refugees in transit, it said.

	Mechanisms for the redistribution of refugees were needed “to guarantee the protection of those concerned” and Switzerland should play its part in this, said the SFH.

	In a statement on its website, the SEM outlined its policy – which applies to minors as well as adult refugees – and stressed that the border “is not closed”, refuting the claims made by some international media.

	Switzerland respects the Dublin agreement and “cannot become a country for the transit of unregulated migration”, said the statement.

	“Switzerland has long been seeking a unified European policy regarding asylum.”

	“The difficult situation for those concerned at the southern border shows that clearly no single European country can meet the challenge alone – not Italy, not Germany and not Switzerland.”

	Europe must find “lasting solutions” by working together, it said.

				The original forecast of 29,000 asylum seekers arriving in Switzerland in 2015 will be ""clearly exceeded"" according to the Secretary of State for Immigration.			

	Mario Gattiker made the comment to the newspaper Basler Zeitung after the paper obtained a leaked document from the Federal Migration Office (SEM) suggesting as many as 10,000 people could arrive in Switzerland in November alone.

	Gattiker wouldn't confirm the prediction, saying instead: “We are registering the same ongoing high level of application numbers as before"".

	However right-wing MP Ueli Maurer leapt on the prediction. Speaking on the SRF programme 10 vor 10, he said: “If you look at the whole situation in Europe then it would certainly be conceivable that Switzerland will receive 10,000 this month.”

Confirmed figures from the SEM show that 4,544 new arrivals applied for asylum in Switzerland in September, 645 more than the previous month.

	From January to September the country received a total of 24,212 asylum seekers, a 34 percent rise on the same period last year.

	Basler Zeitung estimates the figure for October – so far unconfirmed by SEM – to be 4,700.

	According to the paper, Switzerland is becoming more popular with Afghan migrants, with 1,533 seeking asylum in the alpine nation in October alone, a significant rise when compared with the total 1,929 Afghan arrivals in the nine-month period from January to September.

	Gattiker told the paper the influx reflects Germany's policy of favouring Syrian refugees over Afghans.

	Speaking to the NXP news agency, the president of the country's centre-right Liberals party Philipp Müller said the country must react.

	“The confederation must very clearly say that Afghan refugees are only provisionally welcomed in Switzerland.”

	According to NXP the government has budgeted for 24,000 refugees in 2016, at a cost of 1,47 billion francs.

				Andreas Glarner, the mayor of Oberwil-Lieli, the village in the canton of Aargau which chose to pay a fine rather than accept its share of asylum seekers, was moved by a trip to a refugee camp in Greece this week. 			

	Back in May the residents of Oberwil-Lieli, one of the richest villages in Switzerland, voted to pay 290,000 francs a year to the canton rather than agree to shelter ten asylum seekers.

	Glarner, the village mayor and MP for the right-wing Swiss People's Party (SVP), was fully supportive of the decision, saying at the time that Swiss citizens had a duty to resist the pro-refugee dictates of the Swiss capital.

	But on a visit to two migrant camps in Greece this week Glarner was left emotional on seeing the plight of refugees for the first time.

	“It's brutal to see that these people are living in sometimes inhuman conditions. We must do more than we have already to help refugees who are already in Europe,” he told daily Blick, saying that more money should be given to aid agencies helping on the ground.

	Fine words, but also bold ones from a man who previously said Switzerland “must close all of its green borders with barbed wire”.  

	Glarner was visiting the camps on the urging of Zurich-based novelist Andrea Fischer Schulthess, who challenged the politician to go and meet refugees for himself after his comments on asylum policy.

	The poster-boy for the SVP's hardline stance on asylum took time to talk to refugees and was well received by them, with one telling Blick “he's not as bad as I thought”.

	Observing the politician on his visit, Fischer Schulthess told Blick he was open and friendly with the refugees, particularly the children, “but as soon as they mentioned problems and requests, he shut down”.

	It seems despite the emotion of the trip, Glarner hasn't changed his views.

	“I am even more convinced that we must not let refugees come to Europe,” he told Blick, adding that taking them in only encourages more to come.

	Instead, Switzerland should do more to improve conditions in camps in countries neighbouring the conflict zone, he said, so that refugees would be less likely to risk their lives trying to get to Europe.

	Refugees would then be better placed to return to their country when peace comes, he said.

	“If I was a refugee, that's what I would want to do.”

	In March 2015 Switzerland agreed to take in 3,000 Syrian refugees over three years.

	Of those, 1,500 will come through the European Union's refugee relocation programme, aiming to move migrants from Italy and Greece, which Switzerland signed up to voluntarily.

	Since 2011 the country has given 250 million francs in aid to help people in Syria as well as Syrian refugees in Jordan, Libya, Iraq and Turkey.

				Limiting Europe's refugee influx is ""morally and politically necessary"", Germany's president told the World Economic Forum on Wednesday, warning that failing to do so meant ceding ground to populists and extremists.			

	""Limits are not unethical: they help to maintain acceptance within society,"" Joachim Gauck told the world's political and economic elite gathering at Davos.
	   
	""Without acceptance, a society is not open and not willing to take in refugees,"" said Gauck, noting that this was why EU leaders are battling to stem the continent's biggest migrant crisis since the Second World War,"" said the former Protestant pastor.

	""A limitation strategy can be both morally and politically necessary to preserve the state's ability to function,"" he said.

	""It may also be necessary in order to ensure that refugees receive all the assistance they require once they have arrived.""
	   
	Debate is raging in Germany over the country's ability to cope with a record 1.1 million asylum seekers who arrived in 2015.
	   
	Gauck stressed however that the drastic action of slamming the door shut to refugees — as sought by populists and the far-right — was not an option.
	   
	An isolation strategy is different from setting limits, he said, urging supporters of democracy to take ownership of the debate rather than give ground to the extremists.
	   
	""If democrats are unwilling to talk about limits, then they will be leaving the field to populists and xenophobes,"" he added.
	   
	In Germany, he said, the political debate is ""very clear that we should expect some form of control and limits to kick in this year"".
	   
	Like Gauck, Chancellor Angela Merkel has rebuffed calls to close the German borders.
	   
	Instead, she has pledged a ""tangible reduction"" of arrivals in coming months and is counting on a raft of measures at the national and EU level to deliver on that promise.
	   
	These include reinforcing controls at the EU's external borders and getting other members of the bloc to take a bigger share of refugees.
	   
	Berlin is also tightening its scrutiny of asylum seekers by reintroducing individual interviews for all applicants, including Syrians, as well as ramping up the deportation process for those who have failed to win asylum.
	   
	Cases of deportations doubled in 2015 from a year ago, the interior ministry told AFP, with 21,000 forcibly removed from Germany last year.
	   
	The country earlier put several Balkan states on a list of ""safe countries of origin"", whose citizens are unlikely to gain refugee status.
	   
	Berlin is now looking to add to the list several North African countries, such as Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia.

				Switzerland saw a spike in Ukrainians applying for asylum in 2014, although few succeeded in finding permanent refuge in the country, according to data released by Eurostat and analyzed by The Local.			

Five times as many Ukrainians applied for asylum in Switzerland in 2014 than in 2013, with 210 applicants last year compared to 40 in 2013.


	Switzerland rejected 60 Ukrainian asylum applicants in their first attempts, but had not accepted any applicants in 2014, according to Eurostat data released last week.

Overall, the number of Ukrainian asylum seekers in the 28 EU member states ballooned to 14,040 people in 2014 — more than 13 times higher than the number in 2013 at 1,060 applicants.


	That number is even greater when compared to 2008, the beginning of the global economic crisis, when 925 Ukrainians applied for asylum.


	“What we have seen from our members working with asylum seekers are those who are fleeing the conflict in the east of Ukraine,” Julia Zelvenska, a senior legal officer at the European Council on Refugees and Exiles, told The Local.

	“In the past, it has been for political persecution, like in 2013, or for sexual orientation.”


	The Geneva-based UN refugee agency UNHCR said last month that an estimated one million Ukrainians were displaced internally, with many people moving west.

	Some 600,000 people had sought asylum, many of them in non-EU countries such as Russia, Belarus and Moldova.


	But many Ukrainians also applied for asylum in the European Union in 2014, a year that started with a revolution in Kiev and the ousting of the pro-Russian president, Viktor Yanukovych.

	Russia then annexed Crimea in March, in a move widely condemned around the world, before propping up separatists fighting bloody battles with Ukrainian forces in the east of the country.


	Of those who applied for asylum in 2014, 650 Ukrainians received positive outcomes on their first application decision in the EU.

	Eurostat defines positive outcomes as grants of refugee or subsidiary protection status, or an authorisation to stay for humanitarian reasons.


	Still, those who received good news were greatly outnumbered by those who were rejected in their first try - 2,335.


	Zelvenska explained to The Local that it is generally very hard for Ukrainians to gain asylum in EU member states, or to even reach those countries in the first place.


	“One of the main reasons people get rejected may be that many countries are not clear on how the situation developed and won’t issue decisions until it is clear how the Ukrainian situation is going to develop,” she said.


	“European countries are also being very formalistic in the criteria for asylum,” Zelvenska added. “For example, they may say that there are options for alternative protection already within Ukraine. For people in the east, they may say that they could relocate to the west.”


	Zelvenska noted though that reasons for rejection are not made public so it is difficult to know for certain.


	“We think it’s not necessary to apply all the criteria in a strict manner,” she said. “They must consider each case, country and the circumstances.”


	Last year, EU countries received the highest number of asylum seekers since 1992 with a total of 626,000 applicants.

	More than 400,000 people applied in 2013.
	 

	Germany received the highest number of Ukrainian asylum requests at 2,705, Eurostat reported — 18 times greater than the number in 2013, 150. 


	Of the Ukrainians who applied, Germany accepted 20 in the first instance, but rejected another 45.

				Switzerland, Germany and Italy are preparing to launch a joint task force to detect and dismantle networks smuggling refugees and migrants into Europe, Swiss authorities said on Friday.			

	The taskforce, which has been in the planning stage for months, will begin working next month, federal police spokeswoman Cathy Maret told AFP.
	   
	The announcement came as Europe was reeling from the discovery on Thursday of 71 decomposing bodies in an abandoned truck in Austria — in a grim reminder of the ruthlessness of human traffickers.
	   
	Meanwhile, Libyan rescue workers recovered 76 bodies from yet another capsized boat crammed with people trying to flee across the Mediterranean amid fears the toll could rise as high as 200.
	   
	In Switzerland, the fight against human trafficking is handled at a regional level, and it is the canton of Ticino, which borders Italy, which is in charge of the tri-national taskforce, Maret said, although Swiss federal authorities were also supporting the project.
	   
	The taskforce will be based in the small Swiss town of Chiasso on the Italian border, and will be manned by Swiss border guards and German and Italian police.
	   
	""It will be tasked with detecting, pursuing and dismantling the smuggling networks,"" she said.
	   
	Switzerland is both a destination point for migrants as well as an important transit point, with two main routes passing through the country.
	   
	One stretches from Ticino, where Chiasso is located, and leads through Basel in the far north then on to Germany, and the other goes Italy to towards France.
	   
	The number of people arriving in Chiasso by train from Italy — and often immediately sent back there — has been steadily climbing in recent months.
	   
	Switzerland officially registered 7,384 asylum requests in the second quarter of this year, marking a 64-percent increase over the first three months of this year and a 47-percent rise from the same period a year ago.
	   
	Eritreans make up the largest group of asylum seekers in Switzerland, with 3,238 requests in the second quarter, followed by Somalis, Sri Lankans and Syrians.

				Amnesty International has criticized the actions of Switzerland in turning back migrants at the Italian border last year, saying it acted “illegally”.			

	In a press release accompanying its annual report 2016/17, published on Wednesday, Amnesty said the Swiss authorities “had illegally turned back several thousand asylum seekers to Italy”. 

	 

	Among them were “several hundred unaccompanied minors, many of them who had relatives in Switzerland,” it said.

	 

	Switzerland's border guards hit the headlines last summer when reports emerged that migrants trying to get into the country at the border with Italy in the canton of Ticino were being turned back. 

	 

	Italy complained that Switzerland's actions were causing hundreds of migrants to become stranded in the Italian city of Como, with makeshift camps springing up around the train station. 

	 

	At the time the president of an Italian refugee organization said Switzerland had suspended an agreement with Italy allowing some migrants to cross into Italy. 

	 

	But a spokesman for the Swiss border agency told The Local that no such agreement existed and that Switzerland was simpling following the rules. 

	 

	Under Swiss law, any migrant who wishes to seek asylum in Switzerland must present themselves at the border and request asylum. They will then be registered with the relevant authorities and taken into the Swiss asylum system. 

	 

	However many migrants do not wish to claim asylum in Switzerland but simply pass through the country in order to reach another, such as Germany, and claim asylum there. 

	 

	In that case, the Swiss authorities do not consider them to have refugee status and therefore they are sent back to the country they arrived from.

	 

	However in a statement obtained by news agency ATS, Denise Graf, asylum coordinator of the Swiss section of Amnesty, said the methods used by Swiss border guards “prevented or dissuaded people from entering the country”.

	 

	Migrants, including minors, told Amnesty they had tried to lodge an asylum request on numerous occasions but did not succeed.

	 

	In refusing people asylum, “the border guards violate Swiss law,” said Amnesty. 

	 

	Border guards also failed to properly assess people's circumstances before sending them back to Italy, particularly where children were concerned, while a lack of interpreters fuelled confusion at the border, according to the human rights body. 

	 

	No one interviewed by Amnesty in Como had received information from the Swiss authorities about the correct procedure to follow, it added.

	 

	Contacted by The Local, David Marquis, a spokesman for the Swiss Border Agency, said they “vehemently reject this criticism from Amnesty International” and that they had complied with all applicable laws. 

	 

	Those who seek asylum or protection in accordance with the law are passed to reception centres run by the Swiss migration office (SEM), it said. 

	 

	However migrants who merely want to pass through the country and who do not fulfil conditions of entry under Article 5 of the Foreigners Act are extradited to Italy under the terms of a readmission agreement dating from 2000. 

	 

	The agency is “in constant contact with various relief organizations” in order to “optimize” its processes, added Marquis.

	 

	Amnesty's annual report also criticized Switzerland for other actions last year, including restrictions on the movements of asylum seekers in reception centres, and the use of disproportionate force by police in certain cantons during operations to expel migrants. 

	 

	Concerns remain over attempts to deport asylum seekers suffering from mental illness, said the report, mentioning the attempted deportation of a Kurd who had previously tried to commit suicide.

	 

	The report also picked up on the case of a 19-year-old dual national who intended to join Isis, saying the SEM wanted to strip him of his Swiss nationality even though he hadn't yet been convicted of any crime. 

	 

	However Amnesty did have some good things to say, praising the “positive measures” that came out of the new law on asylum, passed in a referendum in June 2016.

	 

	It also noted a new law requiring cantons to ensure that young asylum seekers had access to education, and the lower house of Parliament's vote in favour of giving gay people to right to adopt their partner's children.

				Plans by the canton of Aargau to start putting asylum seekers up in army tents from next week amid a shortage of suitable accommodation have met with mixed reactions.			

	It's the first time Swiss authorities are resorting to tents to deal with a lack of space in reception centres although it is not uncommon in neighbouring countries.

	The Swiss army is erecting 13 tents in the canton to house around 140 young men over the summer, 20 Minuten reported online.

	Aargau said that in June it had to house 276 new asylum seekers and the figure for July was expected to be similar.

	Last week the Swiss government reported a big jump in asylum requests in June.

	Stella Jegher of Amnesty International told the paper that if camps were to be set up it was important to have good infrastructure, protection against heat and cold, and places for people to withdraw to.

	“Special consideration has to be given to young and traumatised refugees,” she said.

	Swiss aid to refugees SFH said the idea was “not unreasonable” for a limited period of time.

	“But no-one wants to see big tent camps like they have in Germany and Austria,” Stefan Frey, refugee organization spokesman told the NZZ online.

	Frey said Switzerland had the option of using civil protection shelters, which other countries did not.

	He said the canton of Aargau was a special case because of its politics being dominated by the rightwing Swiss People's Party.

	Centre-left politicians have criticised the move. “The authorities should be in the position to provide people-friendly accommodation,” SP member of the National Council Bea Heim told 20 Minuten.

	Aargau was sending out a message that there was an emergency situation, but this was not the case, the Social Democrat said.

	“The emergency is in Syria, Eritrea, North Africa and the Mediterranean, not here,” she said.

	But one asylum seeker from Iraq who is being housed by the canton reacted positively to the idea of being put up in a tent.

	“It's unbearably hot in the asylum centre, I'd be happy to live in a tent,” Mohammed told the Tages-Anzeiger.

				Switzerland said on Sunday it was planning to send financial assistance to help Balkans nations cope with the massive numbers of migrants and refugees passing through in a bid to reach the European Union.			

The Swiss foreign ministry confirmed a report in the NZZ am Sonntag weekly that the wealthy Alpine nation aimed to send financial aid to Serbia, Macedonia and Bosnia Herzogovina to help them deal with the ballooning migrant crises on their territories.

	 

	According to the report, Bern plans to send more than 100,000 francs ($103,000), but ministry spokeswoman Silvia Mueller told AFP the amount had yet to be determined.

	 

	The issue will likely be discussed during a bilateral meeting between Switzerland and Serbia next week, she said.

	 

	The assistance could be filtered through authorities and national and international aid organisations on the ground, depending on the needs, the ministry said.

	 

	According to NZZ am Sonntag, Switzerland has already provided 40,000 francs ($41,500) to help build a refugee camp in a Serbian border town.

	 

	Serbia and Macedonia especially have become major transit countries for tens of thousands of migrants trying to reach the EU in recent months, with Macedonia last week forced to declare a state of emergency.

	 

	Bern's decision to send money abroad to help deal with Europe's multifaceted migrant crisis is in line with the way most Swiss would like to respond, according to a poll published Sunday.

	 

	The Basel University survey, published by the Schweiz am Sonntag weekly, showed that 60.9 percent of the more than 1,000 people polled last month want Switzerland -- home to the Red Cross and with a long humanitarian tradition — to take a leading role in the humanitarian response to the crisis.

	 

	But the poll showed that a full 83.1 percent of those questioned want Switzerland to provide generous assistance in the places where the crisis is unfolding, rather than by taking more refugees into the Alpine nation.

	 

	Two thirds of the people polled said they feared allowing too many refugees into Switzerland would hurt the country's prosperity, while 44.6 percent said they wanted Swiss borders temporarily closed.

	 

	The Swiss government has predicted that the country of eight million people will received around 30,000 asylum requests this year and again in 2016.

				Switzerland is expected to offer to accept 4,000 to 5,000 refugees who have entered the European Union largely from the wartorn regions of Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan.			

	The federal government will discuss the offer at a meeting on Friday and is expected to present it to the EU in Brussels on Tuesday, broadcaster RTS reported.

	The goal is to help front-line countries Greece, Italy and Hungary in dealing with the influx of thousands of asylum seekers, as well as Germany and Sweden, which have ended up with the bulk of them.

	Swiss President Simonetta Sommaruga told reporters at a meeting of German-speaking heads of state in Liechtenstein on Thursday that there was no national solution to the asylum issue but only a pan-European one.

	The federal government has thus far avoiding discussing the refugee issue, given that most asylum seekers have been heading to Germany and Sweden, giving Switzerland a wide birth.

	Voters in Switzerland last year approved capping immigration from the EU in defiance of a freedom of movement agreement that Bern signed with Brussels.

	But the dynamics of the refugee crisis changed this week after Germany, which expects to take in one million refugees this year, temporarily closed its borders after being overwhelmed by migrants.

	Austria and Hungary followed suit and now Slovenia and Croatia have put in similar controls.

	Police clashed with refugees on Wednesday in Hungary, where the state has erected a barbed-wire fence on its border.

	Donald Tusk, president of the European Council, called an emergency summit for next Wednesday to talk about instituting an EU quota system, which has been vigorously opposed by Eastern European countries.

	The Swiss government, meanwhile, will also discuss the possibility of humanitarian aid to help non-governmental organizations (NGOs) active in Iraq or Syria, RTS reported.

	A sum of between 50 million francs and 100 million francs has been proposed, the broadcaster said.

					11:20 CEST+02:00				", The Local,Rising tensions spark rise in violence at asylum centres,"
				Frustrations are spilling over in refugee centres in Switzerland causing an increasing number of confrontations between residents, according to figures reported by the Sunday papers. 			

	During the first quarter of 2016 security guards had to deal with twice the amount of violent situations as in previous quarters, said SonntagsZeitung, quoting an internal report from the Swiss federal migration office (SEM).

	In most cases, security guards were able to diffuse the situation, and the police were called in only 77 out of 240 incidents, reported news agencies.

	For the SEM, the rise in tensions in asylum centres is linked to the fact that fewer migrants arrived in 2015.

	As a result, there was no pressing need to make room in centres by moving some asylum seekers to accommodation elsewhere, meaning people stayed longer in one place and tensions rose.

	“With time, consideration towards others decreases,” said a spokesman for the SEM quoted by news agencies.

	Frustrations also arise among those who become aware they have little chance of obtaining asylum, said Constantin Hruschka of the Swiss Refugee Council.

	Since the beginning of the year, the SEM has increased security provision at refugee centres including those in Altstätten and Kreuzlingen.

	But that's not enough, according to the SRC.

	“Instead of concentrating on security services it would be better to invest more in care,” Hruschka told SonntagsZeitung.

	One issue could be that some refugees do not have enough to do. While the SEM stipulates that asylum seekers should be kept occupied with activities such as language courses for at least four hours a day, many centres are not reaching these targets.

	Asylum seekers are not allowed to take a job in the first three months after applying for asylum, which can be extended to six months.

	After this period applicants can look for temporary gainful employment, if the labour market allows it. Jobs may be limited to certain sectors.

	Last week one man died and another was left seriously injured after they were stabbed at an underground asylum centre in the canton of Aargau.

	The two victims and the perpetrator were all Iranian refugees living at the same centre.

   ""According to initial results, this is not a case of infection caused by the Ebola virus,"" the Swiss Federal Office of Public Health said in a statement.   The office said that the man had arrived at an asylum centre in the western town of Vallorbe on September 17th, and had told officials that he had left Guinea for France two days earlier.       Officials at the centre acted fast because the man said he had lost a family member to Ebola, placing him in quarantine under watch from physicians.       After he began showing feverish symptoms on Tuesday, the authorities decided to transfer him immediately to Lausanne amid tight security.       The office stressed that the disease does not spread until the symptoms appear, and that there was no risk to the local population, saying the swift handling of the case showed the effectiveness of Ebola monitoring in the country.   Treatment of the Guinean came a day after a Geneva-based international aid organization flew one of its doctors to Geneva from Sierra Leone, after he was bitten by a child with the virus.
  Initial checks showed the doctor is not infected, although he remains under observation at the Geneva university hospital (HUG).   The Geneva-based World Health Organization warned in a study released on Tuesday that the number of Ebola infections will triple to 20,000 by November, soaring by thousands every week if efforts to stop the outbreak are not stepped up radically.   ""If we don't stop the epidemic very soon, this is going to turn from a disaster into a catastrophe,"" said Christopher Dye, the head of strategy at the WHO and a co-author of the study.   A day earlier the WHO said  that the recent outbreak of Ebola in west Africa — the deadliest in history — has already killed 2,811 people.

	UN refugee agency spokeswoman Melissa Fleming did not directly respond to Trump's call for a ""total and complete shutdown"" of Muslims coming to the US, but said the UN was concerned about the impact of such remarks.
	   
	""We have a very strong resettlement programme to the United States and the resettlement programme includes Syrian refugees,"" Fleming said in a response to a question about Trump.
	   
	""We are concerned that the rhetoric that is being used in the election campaign is putting an incredibly important resettlement programme at risk,"" she told journalists.
	   
	She also referred to a call from several US state governors — made after last months' jihadist attacks in Paris — for a pause in the resettlement of Syrian refugees.
	   
	""The Obama administration has been standing by the programme . . . it would be a shame if this were halted,"" Fleming further said.
	   
	The UN spokeswoman noted that the US takes in more refugees each year than any other country in the world, roughly 100,000 people.
	   
	In seeking to underscore the importance of resettlement programmes, especially for Syrians, Fleming said there were indications that a surge in air strikes by foreign militaries had forced more people to flee their homes.
	   
	""We definitely have seen an increase in displacement in recent weeks,"" Fleming said, when asked about the impact of rising bombardments by a US-led coalition as well as Russian jets.
	   
	She said it was still too early to quantify the impact of intensified air strikes, noting that violence on the ground and forced conscription by the Islamic State group were also still forcing people to flee.
	   
	More than four million people have fled Syria's brutal civil war and more than seven million others are displaced within the country.
	   
	The flood of people fleeing Syria has been the main driver of the Europe's migrant crisis.
	   
	In updated figures, the International Organization for Migration said Tuesday that 909,000 migrants had entered Europe by sea this year, meaning the one million mark could be passed by December 31st.
	   
	Migrants have entered Europe in 2015 at nearly four times the 2014 rate, a trend that further highlighted the need for refugee resettlement programmes, including in the US, Fleming said.
	   
	The programme ""is meant for the most vulnerable people, the victims of wars the world is unable to stop,"" she told journalists.

	The first time was in 2015 when they left Syria to join R.O.'s former husband in northern Europe on family reunion grounds. She was granted asylum there.

She says that the marriage was difficult even in Syria but she had hoped the situation would be better in Europe. This was not the case. 

	On arrival in Switzerland, R.O. applied for asylum but was rejected. An appeal was then turned down after judges decided the family were not vulnerable and that they should be sent to a safe third country.

	The northern European country where she had been granted asylum was ruled to be responsible for her.

	Her children, currently happily attending the local school, were described as well brought/up.

	However, the family are all traumatised and in psychological treatment, doctors have said.

	These are the words of Yusuf, a young man from Sudan who worked cleaning McDonald's restaurants “non-stop” and “without breaks” for some 40 days with just four days off in late 2014 and early 2015.

	Yusuf was not paid for any of this cleaning work because his employer – a subsidiary of Swiss firm Top Clean Reinigungen GmbH – had offered him a chance at obtaining a B permit, which allows people to live in Switzerland for up to five years.

	The Sudanese man, who currently holds an F permit allowing him to stay in Switzerland on a provisional basis only, believed he would only be paid once that B permit had been organized.

	It wasn't until a fellow resident at the refugee home where he lived explained that if his boss had yet to provide him with a contract or pay him, he was unlikely to do ever do either.

	The two men then reported the cleaning firm to Swiss union Unia which investigated the case and recently reported on it in its magazine Work.

	When Yusuf went on to demand 6,868 Swiss francs in wages from the cleaning firm, his manager offered him 3,000 francs, but also demanded he retract his complaint. He refused.

	Speaking about the case, the media spokesperson for McDonald's in Switzerland, Aglaë Strachwitz, said the restaurant chain had no direct connection with the cleaning company in question, and that such services were contracted out.

	The Geneva McDonald's franchise group in question has now cancelled its contract with Top Clean after the firm failed to answer the companies questions “to our satisfaction”, Strachwitz added.

	Lawyers for Top Clean have chosen not to speak publicly about the case.

				The number of people seeking asylum in Switzerland has fallen considerably from last year, according to new figures published by the Swiss migration office (SEM) on Thursday.			

	In November 1,963 asylum applications were lodged in the country, 66 percent fewer than the same period last year.

	The main reason for the drop in numbers is due to the closing of the Balkans route last March, SEM said in a statement.

	“The four final months of 2015 were marked by a sizeable number of migrants arriving in Switzerland via that route. Since it was closed, relatively few asylum seekers arrive in that way,” it said.

	The closure of the Balkans route has mostly affected migrants from Afghanistan, it said. In November 2,277 fewer Afghans arrived in Switzerland than in November 2015.

	Numbers of Iraqi and Syrian asylum seekers were also down.

	The largest group of asylum seekers arriving in November were from Eritrea, with 500 applicants lodged, followed by Syria (166), Guinea (139), Afghanistan (109) and Sri Lanka (92).

	The figures mean Switzerland will probably receive far fewer asylum seekers this year than predicted.

	Since the beginning of the year 25,441 asylum seekers have arrived in the country, 36.2 percent down on last year’s total of 34,653.

	The SEM therefore expects the final figure at the end of this year to be less than 30,000, the approximate total predicted in July.

	Switzerland has also taken part in two refugee programmes this year.

	During November 64 Syrian refugees from Lebanon arrived in the country as part of the UN Refugee Agency’s relocation programme for particularly vulnerable people living in refugee camps in countries neighbouring Syria.

	Since 2015 a total of 935 people have come to Switzerland in this way, with more due to arrive in December.

	The country also last month accepted 49 migrants transferred from Greece and Italy under an EU programme aimed at easing the pressure on those countries.

	 ""I think it's despicable that Denmark and also in a sense Switzerland are moving to seize the last remaining assets of people, who by virtue of their movement and vulnerability tend to be impoverished and have very little on them,"" Kenneth Roth, the executive director of Human Rights Watch told a news conference in Istanbul.

	Denmark's parliament on Tuesday adopted reforms aimed at dissuading migrants from seeking asylum by delaying family reunifications and allowing authorities to seize valuables to pay for the stay of migrants in asylum centres.
	   
	Meanwhile, Swiss law has since the 1990s required asylum seekers to contribute to the costs of hosting them in the wealthy Alpine country.
	   
	""Does a rich country like Denmark really need to strip the very assets of these desperate asylum seekers before providing them basic services?"" asked Roth, who was presenting HRW's annual report in Istanbul.
	   
	""If Denmark wanted the asylum seekers to pay back, they would get them a job, which is what most asylum seekers want,"" he added.
	   
	The seizure plans appear ""purely vindictive and purely an effort to send a signal 'don't you dare come to Denmark if you're an asylum seeker who has arrived to European Union'"", he said.
	   
	""That cold hearted response is not what we would expect from a wealthy European Union member.""

	Some have likened the Danish proposals to the confiscation of gold and other valuables from Jews by the Nazis during the Holocaust.
	   
	But Prime Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen defended it as ""the most misunderstood bill in Denmark's history.""

					18:00 CEST+02:00				",AFP,UN agency tests Ikea refugee shelter,"
				The Geneva-based UN refugee agency has turned to Swedish furniture giant Ikea to make more durable and functional shelters for refugees world-wide.			
 The first prototypes of the new shelters — which come in flatpack boxes and which can be assembled in just four hours without tools — will soon be rolled out, the agency said on Friday.  ""We will set up 26 (ready-to-assemble shelters) which have already arrived in Ethiopia,"" head of innovation at UNHCR, Oliver Delarue, told AFP.  ""Twelve will soon arrive at the Iraqi border for Syrian refugees and 12 in Lebanon, also for Syrians.""   Refugee camps today often consist of overcrowded tents that can be sweltering hot during the day and freezing at night, with no electricity and thus no light or heat after nightfall.  UNHCR hopes that could become a thing of the past, as it prepares to roll out 50 cottage-like shelter prototypes with flexible solar panels on the roofs for power and specially-made walls that can deflect heat during the day and retain it at night.  Ikea's philanthropist foundation has funded the project to the tune of $4 million, while a Sweden-based group called the Refugee Housing Unit has been working with the UN agency on the design.  The prototypes, with their semi-hard plastic walls and roofs made from composite material and with room to house five people each, have cost $8,000 a piece, and UNHCR wants to wait for feedback from refugees before giving a green light to more wide-scale production.  Over time, the UN agency expects the unit price for the new shelters to come down to around $1,000, which is still double the $500 it currently pays for each of its refugee tents.  The prototype shelters were all made by hand in Sweden, although not in Ikea factories, Delarue said, insisting that the Ikea Foundation's participation in the project was not commercially motivated.  One of the main advantages with the new shelters is their durability, he said, pointing out that UNHCR's traditional canvas refugee tents rarely last much longer than six months in climates like those found in countries like Jordan or South Sudan.  The new shelters have been guaranteed to last three years and will likely remain standing for longer than that, Delarue said.  That is a big plus considering that refugees on average live in their UNHCR shelters for 12 years.  Transport remains a challenge, though, since the shelter kits weigh 100 kilos each, compared to just 60 kilos for the average tent.  More than 15 million people were living as refugees around the world last year, while another nearly 29 million were displaced within their own country -- the highest combined number in two decades, according to UNHCR statistics released last week.

	The silent march, organized by the regional branches of Amnesty International and the Green party in the canton of Valais, saw local people, refugees already established in the Valais city and left-wing politicians parade through the streets of Sion.

	Demonstrators carried placards calling for an end to drownings in the Mediterranean and safer ways for refugees to reach Europe.

	Anne-Christine Willa of Amnesty International’s Valais branch told news agency ATS: “Our aim was to reflect on the dramas that these refugees are going through.”

	“We wanted to mobilise people across the political and religious divide to reaffirm that human dignity knows no borders, parties or religions.”  

	All major political parties supported the demonstration officially, according to ATS, apart from the right-wing Swiss People’s Party and liberal FDP.

	It also garnered support from the Bishop of Sion – though he was not present in person, said the paper – the Islamic Cultural Centre of Sion and an Islamic association in nearby Martigny.

	Switzerland expects to receive around 30,000 asylum requests by the end of this year, a sharp increase on the 23,765 requests placed last year, which was already an 11 percent rise on 2013 figures.

	However that remains a modest rise compared to the influx experienced by other European countries.

	Switzerland said recently it was prepared to take in some 5,000 refugees in the next two years on the condition the Dublin system remains in place.

	Pro-refugee demonstrations have also taken place in Zurich, Geneva and Lausanne in the past few weeks.

  Deporting the Tarakhel family, which includes six children, without first getting assurances from Italy they would be taken care of and kept together is a violation of Article Three of the European Convention on Human Rights, the court ruled.       The decision is final and can serve as a precedent for other migrants in a similar situation.       The court noted that the UN refugee agency had previously raised concerns over Italy's procedures for caring for refugees.       ""The possibility that a significant number of asylum seekers may be left without accommodation or accommodated in overcrowded facilities without any privacy, or even in insalubrious or violent conditions, cannot be dismissed as unfounded,"" the court ruled.       Italy has seen a massive rush of migrants over the past year trying to reach the country in highly dangerous sea voyages.   Authorities have rescued over 150,000 migrants since two deadly shipwrecks in October 2013 killed 400 people.       The Tarakhel family was to be deported to Italy, where they had landed in July 2011, under the EU rule referred to as the Dublin Regulation.   The regulation says asylum seekers like the Tarakhels must have their case judged in the European country where they first landed.       After landing in Italy, the Tarakhels went to Austria to apply for asylum, but it was rejected and referred to Italian authorities.   The family then headed for Switzerland where they lodged a new asylum request in November 2011.       Swiss officials decided to simply pass the family's asylum application to Italy.   Despite their case being passed to Italy, the family and its six children, the youngest of which was born in 2012, continue to live in the city of Lausanne.       German European Deputy Ska Keller noted the court raises the question of whether Italy has the capacity to handle other countries' migrants.       ""The ruling shows the 'Dublin Regulation' is not working at all anymore,"" Keller said in a statement..

	The district court of Zofingen handed the sentence to the 30-year-old refugee on Thursday after he admitted to killing the victim one evening in April 2012, the SDA news agency reported.

	The defendant explained that the Swiss came to talk to him at an asylum centre in Brittnau, where he promised him a job with a farmer, according to court testimony.

	He invited the Moroccan to his home, where the pair drank beer before going upstairs to a bedroom and the Moroccan claimed he fell asleep on a bed, the SDA said.

	The refugee testified he felt he needed to defend himself after the Swiss tried to sexually attack him.

	The court earlier heard evidence that the Moroccan tied the hands and feet of the older man before beating him with the log in order to steal some personal possessions.

	During the court case, witnesses testified that the victim had often visited the asylum centre, where he sought out men for sexual relations, the SDA said.

	Investigators found traces of DNA from two other refugees in the Swiss man's bed.

	The prosecutor had nonetheless sought a life sentence against the Moroccan, who entered Switzerland illegally in February 2012.

	The man already had a criminal record in Switzerland after stealing a handbag from a woman in Zofingen.

	For that offence he was ordered to pay a financial penalty, as well as a fine.

					11:35 CEST+02:00				", The Local,Chaos in Como after Swiss send back refugees,"
				Around 100 refugees are reported to be camping out around Como's San Giovanni station after being turned back by Swiss border guards.			

	Makeshift camps are springing up around the station in the northern Italian city to house hundreds of migrants who were sent back from Switzerland after attempting to enter the country illegally at the border crossing at Chiasso, in the canton of Ticino.

	The backlog is turning Como into “an open-air refugee centre”, local politician Nicola Molteni told Milan newspaper Il Giorno.

	And the blame is being placed squarely on Switzerland.

	“Until last week an agreement with Switzerland allowed 100 migrants to cross into Chiasso every 15 days,” Alberto Sinigallia, president of Arca, a group which manages local refugee centres, told La Repubblica.

	“That has been suspended for the time being, but it was an important release valve that helped us manage migrant flows,” he added.

	Contacted by The Local, Walter Pavel of the Swiss border agency (EZV), could not confirm that any such agreement existed and said Switzerland was simply following the rules.

	A migrant who wishes to seek asylum in Switzerland must present themselves at the border and request asylum.

	If they do not – because they want to pass through Switzerland and request asylum in another country – they are not considered to have refugee status and are sent back to Italy.

	“The number of migrants who submit an application for asylum at the border in Ticino with the Border Guard has decreased in the past few weeks,” Pavel told The Local.

	“Migrants who wish to merely pass through (transit) Switzerland will be sent back by the Swiss Border Guard according to the readmission agreement with Italy.”

	The number of illegal immigrants coming through the Ticino border crossing has increased with the recent warmer weather.

	At the beginning of July Switzerland caught  a record 1,300 migrants attempting to cross from Italy into Switzerland in one week alone. One Eritrean hopeful even made headlines after being filmed attempting to make it over the border crammed inside a suitcase.

	And on Tuesday border guards caught 60 migrants without papers on a train in the Swiss city of Bellinzona. They were subsequently sent back to the border.

	Of the 1,300 that arrived in the first week of July, 996 were sent back.

	Switzerland's rigidity in sticking to the rules is creating “A real emergency situation which risks paralyzing Como's security system,” Como police chief Ernesto Molteni is quoted as saying by Swiss paper 24 Heures.

	The camping migrants are being provided with meals and aid from the Catholic aid agency, Caritas. But with aid agencies already stretched to the limit experts say they will struggle to manage if the camp continues to grow.

	“We're providing food, clothes and trying to set up some showers for them,” said Caritas director Roberto Bernasconi, “But it's very difficult, we're already working to help the 2,000 migrants who are housed in Como's refugee centers,” he added.

	“The situation around the station is disgraceful,” said Lombardy governor, Roberto Calderoli, from Italy's right-wing Northern League Party.

	“Como is becoming the new Calais.” 

	But Ticino's police chief hit back at the criticism.

	“We register a big proportion of migrants who arrive in our centres, though they should have already been registered in Italy,” he told 24 Heures. “We are doing our bit.”

	Under the Dublin rules of the Schengen agreement, immigrants must be registered in the country they first arrive in within the Schengen zone.

				Switzerland's Aargau canton is planning to purchase 200 Ikea-designed flat-pack homes to provide temporary accommodation for asylum seekers in the region.			

	The move, a first for Switzerland, was announced by Greens politician Susanne Hochuli on Thursday.

	Aargau has already tested the 17.5 square-metre homes designed by the Swedish furniture giant together with the UNHCR.

	Authorities now plan to set up 60 such units providing homes for 300 people in an industrial estate near the town of Frick in 2016. The kit homes will be placed within two warehouses with one set aside for families and one housing men only. They will then be disassembled in 2018.

	The shelters, which arrive in the same cardboard boxes as other large pieces of Ikea furniture, can be set up in four hours without any special tools.

	They are not heated and don't feature plumbing but Hochuli believes the ventilated homes are preferable to another housing option already being used by Aargau: civil protection bunkers.

	At a cost of 1,200 Swiss francs per shelter plus 500 Swiss francs for the furniture required, cost is also a definite advantage, the Tribune de Genève reports.

	Swiss federal authorities will be watching the Frick experiment closely although there remains, to date, no shortage of accommodation in the country's civil facilities.

	Switzerland's defence minister Ueli Maurer said in early October Switzerland's emergency public bunkers could provide shelter for up to 50,000 people.

	At present, however, just 3,500 refugees are housed in such facilities.

	Bern will be watching proceedings in Frick carefully for another reason too.

	The carefully-planned project – local authorities in Frick have been fully involved with every stage of its development – also functions as a public relations exercise with cantonal authorities testing the waters as they push towards the establishment of larger, fixed asylum centres in future, according to the regional daily Aargauer Zeitung.

	Switzerland said recently it was prepared to take in some 5,000 refugees in the next two years on the condition the Dublin system remains in place.

	To date, the country has seen only a limited numbers of refugees.

	September figures released by the Swiss Migration Office (SEM) show that a total of 3,899 asylum requests were placed in August, just three more than in July and hardly the influx experienced by other European countries.

	Of the Swiss total, 1,610 requests came from Eritreans, 461 from Afghans, 401 from Syrians and 180 from Iraqis.

	Maurer said the cantons were in a better position than the federal government in terms of providing places in bunkers, and noted the army could only help out in terms of equipment and supplies.

	Speaking about Switzerland's position in the current refugee crisis, the defence minister said he hoped the country would not face a situation like that seen in Hungary and Austria where authorities have struggled with thousands of refugees making their way to Germany.

	 “We can't, however, rule out the possibility that Switzerland could become a destination (for refugees) within days or hours,” he said.

Many Eritrean and Somalian refugees are taking extreme measures to destroy their fingerprints to avoid being identified and returned to the first country they entered in Europe. 
""The most common method is to grind the fingertips  down, for example by using sandpaper. They can also easily be worn  down on a rough wall of a house,"" Roger Boxler, head of the refugee  reception center at Kreuzlingen, told newspaper Tages Anzeiger.
The fingertips take approximately two to three  weeks to re-generate. During this time, the refugees are kept in  reception centres, which are becoming overcrowded as a result of the  high volume of traffic. 
Once the  fingertips have repaired sufficiently, the fingerprinting process is  repeated, enabling the authorities to track if, when and where the  individual was previously admitted to the asylum system.
While no official figures are available, reception  centres across Switzerland estimate that there are some 200 migrants  per year arriving with ""polished fingertips"", Tages Anzeiger reported.
Large numbers of asylum seekers arrive every month in places such as Italy or Greece. Feeling their futures might be more secure elsewhere, the migrants often decide to try their luck with more hospitable countries such as Switzerland and Germany, the newspaper said.
But their efforts are hampered by the so-called Dublin Regulation, which prevents asylum seekers from submitting applications to multiple member states across the EU as well as in Switzerland, Norway and Iceland. 
This means that asylum seekers typically use up their one application when they arrive in the first country. 
Fingerprints are taken at first registration and recorded in a database so that individuals travelling later without papers can be traced to see if and where they have entered the asylum system previously.
As a result, migrants desperate for a better life are removing their fingerprints in the hopes of getting a second bite at the cherry."

Switzerland said Wednesday it had finally finished the process of  rehabilitating more than a hundred people punished during WWII for  having helped Jews escape Nazi persecution. 
But only one of the 137 people vindicated by the report actually lived to see their name cleared.
""All these people are today dead,"" Alexandre Schneebeli, the secretary of the Swiss parliament's rehabilitation commission, told AFP.
And of them only Aimee Stitelman lived to see her name officially cleared, several years ago.
In 1945, a Swiss military court ordered her detained for 15 days for having helped 15 Jewish children who were fleeing the Nazis, some of them orphans, enter Switzerland.
The rehabilitation commission struck down the conviction in March 2004, when she was 79 years old. She died a year later.
The committee was set up in 2004 to acknowledge the injustice done to people in Switzerland who took it upon themselves to help Jews escape Nazi persecution.
The Swiss courts punished those they caught on the grounds that their actions had violated Swiss neutrality.
According to historians, several hundred people lost their job, were fined and in some cases even jailed for having sheltered Jews hiding from the Nazis.
Thus a 25-year-old commercial traveller was jailed for two and a half months by one court for having helped a Viennese Jew get into the country. The Jew he helped was also jailed for two months -- and then sent back over the border.
While Switzerland helped nearly 300,000 refugees from Nazi-occupied Europe during the war years, it also turned back 20,000 of them, most of them Jews.
A committee of historians concluded in 2001 that the policy pursued by the Swiss between 1933, when Hitler came to power in Germany and 1945, when he was finally defeated by the Allied forces, had been ""excessively restrictive.""
The Swiss parliament adopted the rehabilitation law as a result. But the official recognition that their actions were right and proper does not include any compensation.
Of the 137 people rehabilitated, 59 were Swiss, 34 French, 24 Italian, six German, three Polish, with one Czech, one Hungarian, a Spaniard -- and several others who at the time in question were stateless.
According to the work of the researchers some of them acted for purely humanitarian reasons and others out of a sense of patriotism, while some were also motivated by the money that refugees offered them.
The commission completed its work after eight years, having started in 2004, Wednesday's statement from parliament said.
Its research had brought an important chapter of the country's history to public attention, publicising the actions of people who until now were unknown, Wednesday's statement said.
""This recognition was essential in the eyes of the people concerned and those close to them,"" the statement added."

				Some Sri Lankans living in Switzerland may face a return home after the Swiss government signed a migration agreement with Colombo.			

	Justice minister Simonetta Sommaruga signed the accord on Tuesday during a visit to the South Asian country.

	It strengthens cooperation on migration matters and regulates the terms of the repatriations of Sri Lankan nationals following the end of the civil war in the country.

	“The new agreement serves to formalise... the existing procedures for mutual cooperation with the Sri Lankan authorities with regard to the readmission of persons who no longer fulfil the conditions for continued residence in [Switzerland],” the Federal Department of Justice and Police said in a statement.

	From 1983 to 2009 Switzerland was a popular destination for Tamil refugees. Even today a fear of army and police violence is driving some Tamils from the country's north and east to file asylum requests.

	However, the situation has eased with the number of pending requests for asylum declining, according to the State Secretariat for Migration (SEM), the Swiss news agency SDA reported.

	The SEM says this is not down to a toughening of asylum policy. After a halt to repatriations for several months, a number of old cases dating back to before the end of the war have now been dealt with.

	More recent requests have less chance of success, it said.

	The migration agreement is controversial because the human rights situation in Sri Lanka remains unstable.

	Human rights groups fear returnees who are suspected of sympathizing with the separatist cause could face arrest and torture.

	Sommaruga has rejected this argument, saying that every case will continue to be considered on an individual basis.

	A body of experts from both countries will be set up to deal with repatriation problems.

	Switzerland could also raise sensitive issues here, notably the Sri Lankan anti-terror law under which people are continuing to be arbitrarily arrested.

	According to Wikipedia there are 46,000 to 55,000 Sri Lankans in Switzerland.

				The Geneva-based UN refugee agency said on Monday it was ""alarmed"" by the consequences of US President Donald Trump's order barring refugee arrivals, describing those targeted as ""anxious, confused and heartbroken.""			

	""This week alone, over 800 refugees were set to make America their new home,"" the UNHCR said in a statement.

	   

	The order signed by Trump on Friday suspends arrivals by refugees in general for 120 days and Syrian refugees indefinitely.

	   

	""UNHCR estimates that 20,000 refugees in precarious circumstances might have been resettled to the United States during the 120 days covered by the suspension,"" the statement added, basing that figure on averages over the last 15 years.

	   

	""Refugees are anxious, confused and heartbroken at this suspension,"" it further said, describing UNHCR chief Filippo Grandi as ""deeply worried"" by the impact of Trump's move.

	   

	Refugees who qualify for resettlement to the US or other developed countries have typically endured extreme hardships and have no prospect of safely returning to their home countries.

	   

	The US president's widely-condemned executive order also bars entry for travellers from seven mainly Muslim countries -- Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen -- for 90 days.

	 

Funding cuts?

	 

	UN human rights chief Zeid bin Ra'ad Zeid al-Hussein, who rarely communicates on Twitter, said in a tweet that ""discrimination on nationality alone is forbidden under human rights law"", adding that ""the US ban is also mean-spirited and wastes resources needed for proper counter-terrorism.""

	 

	However UN reactions to Trump's order have been largely tepid until now.

	 

	The UN bodies most directly engaged with migration -- the UN refugee agency and the International Organization for Migration (IOM) -- issued a statement on Saturday which made no mention of the executive order and stopped far short of condemning it.

	   

	IOM spokeman Leonard Doyle on Monday dismissed suggestions that the Trump administration had threatened funding cuts if its policies were publicly criticized.

	   

	""I have heard nothing of the sort,"" Doyle told AFP.

	   

	According to IOM's website, the Geneva-based body receives funding from the US Agency of International Development and multiple divisions of the State Department but the details of those contributions were not immediately available.

	   

	Doyle said that in the aftermath of Trump's executive action the immediate concern was the protection of refugees whose resettlement process to the United States was ongoing.

	   

	""Suddenly they are back where they started or they are back several steps behind,"" Doyle said.

	   

	""We are worried about their immediate vulnerability,"" he added.

	 

	Asked if IOM would push Trump's government to reverse the new policy in the coming weeks, Doyle said, ""we are hopeful that in the process of the review, when they have looked at every aspect of refugees, that things will return to an even keel.""

				Four Ghanaians living in Italy have been arrested for allegedly smuggling more than 200 migrants across the Italian-Swiss border.			

	The arrests were the result of a joint operation between Swiss and Italian police investigating people smuggling from the Italian city of Como into the Swiss canton of Ticino, reported news agencies. 

	 

	The four suspects, aged from 21 to 39, are legal residents of Italy. 

	 

	They are accused of demanding payment of 90-150 euros per person to help migrants illegally cross into Switzerland, driving them to Lugano or even as far as Zurich. 

	 

	The police operation dates back to October, when investigators identified a vehicle that had crossed the border at Ronago, west of Como, 45 times in a month. 

	 

	A 23-year-old Ghanaian woman was arrested in December, while three other people were taken into custody on Friday. 

	 

	The Swiss-Italian border is a popular crossing point for migrants travelling from Greece and Italy. 

	 

	Migrants are allowed to pass into Switzerland if they claim asylum at the border. However many do not want to stay in Switzerland but wish to transit through the country on their way to Germany, preferring to seek asylum there. But in that case Switzerland does not consider them to have refugee status, and therefore sends them back to Italy.

	 

	Last July the Swiss border guards were criticized by Italy for refusing entry to migrants who did not want to claim asylum, causing an overflow of people stuck in Como after being turned away by Switzerland. 

	 

	However the Swiss border agency said Switzerland was simply following the rules of a readmission agreement with Italy.

	 

	At the time, the number of migrants attempting to cross into Switzerland was at a record high, but that has since fallen.

	 

	In September a Socialist Party MP was arrested at a border point in Ticino for allegedly helping migrant children cross illegally into Switzerland.

	 

	Legal proceedings are ongoing against Lisa Bosia Mirra, who in December was part of a group of volunteers awarded a 12,000 franc prize for providing hot meals to migrants in Como ""and accompanying them to the Swiss-Italian border"", Ticino Online reported.

	 

	In January the number of people lodging a request for asylum in Switzerland was 1,588, 10 percent fewer than in December and 56 percent fewer than in January 2016, according to the Swiss migration office (SEM).

				UPDATED: The Swiss city of Zurich has announced it will not use the 62 Ikea refugee shelters it has purchased to house asylum-seekers after a test showed they constituted a fire hazard.			

	Amid growing numbers of refugees and other migrants arriving in Switzerland, Zurich city councillor Raphael Golta on Friday morning unveiled a large hall filled with dozens of Ikea ready-to-assemble refugee shelters.

	The city had purchased the shelters with the aim of using them to house 250 people by early January. But just a few hours later, the city was forced to announce that a fire safety test had revealed the shelters do not live up to Swiss fire protection requirements.

	The test showed the temporary shelters “are easily combustible,” the city of Zurich said in a statement.

	Golta voiced surprise at the verdict, but insisted the city had done its best under the circumstances.

	“We have to host 40 percent more asylum seekers in the space of two months, so we had to move quickly to choose the best solution available,” he told the RTS public broadcaster.

	The shelters, developed in cooperation between Swedish furniture giant Ikea and the UN refugee agency, have already reportedly been deployed by the thousand in refugee camps and in places like Greece that are facing a heavy influx of migrants.

	The city of Zurich said it had relied on safety information from the UNHCR and a Swedish study.

	But regional authorities had requested a new test after learning that a German report this week raised concerns about the accuracy of the Swedish study.

	UNHCR spokeswoman Anja Klug told Swiss news agency ATS on Friday that the organisation was preparing to compare the Swiss and Swedish safety test results.

	“If we discover problems, we will seek a solution,” she said, stressing though that the shelters are “emergency housing, temporary solutions, which we consider better than tents.”

	Maerta Terne, a spokeswoman for the Better Shelter project, born out of a collaboration between the Ikea Foundation and the UN refugee agency, told AFP she could not comment on the Swiss safety test before seeing a ""translation of the report on the results and the method used.""

	However, she stressed the tests against European safety standards ""on the walls and covering panels showed that the material held a security level superior to that required for temporary shelter.""

	The Swiss canton of Aargau, which had been planning to house 300 asylum seekers in the Ikea shelters within a few months, also said Friday it was seeking alternatives following the Zurich test results.

	Switzerland is expecting to receive some 39,000 asylum applicants this year, up from 23,800 in 2014.

					10:32 CEST+02:00				",Lyssandra Sears,Swiss mull tough benefit cuts for asylum seekers,"
The Swiss parliament will decide this week on whether to dramatically cut the amount of financial support received by asylum seekers. 
The current emergency aid provisions enable asylum seekers who have had their applications rejected to receive on average between  six and ten francs (between $6.25 and $10.41) a day as they await deportation. The amount to be  received in each case is decided at the cantonal level.
A parliamentary debate began on Wednesday morning to discuss tough new measures that include applying the emergency measures to all asylum seekers, thereby preventing them from receiving more lucrative social welfare benefits.
For asylum seekers in Aargau, emergency aid amounts to 7.50 ($7.81) a day, while in Luzern, emergency cases are given Coop supermarket vouchers worth ten francs ($10.41) a day, newspaper Tages Anzeiger reported.
In Aargau, the 7.50 is intended to cover food, clothing, hygiene items, transport tickets and phone calls. In Graubünden, each person’s entitlement is spent on food, which is delivered twice a week to a depot. Those failing to turn up lose their entitlement.
The introduction of the minimal emergency aid policy was an attempt to discourage people from coming and staying in Switzerland, although the Swiss Refugee Council said in 2010 that people would stay in Switzerland even if no assistance was offered.
Arguing in favour of changes that would reduce the attractiveness of Switzerland for asylum seekers, Heinz Brand of the Swiss People's Party voiced his support for benefit cuts and the idea that criminal refugees should be kept in special closed quarters.
Green Party National Councillor Balthasar Glättli disagreed with Brand, believing that the causes of crimes committed  by the refugees should be looked at more closely. He believes that  criminals should be put to work in the community so that they are tired  at night and do not turn to alcohol.
Speaking on broadcaster SF's Arena show, Brand said the drop in income would be small, but significant enough to discourage asylum seekers. 
However, taking the examples of cantons including Basel-City and Zurich, Tages-Anzeiger showed that the measures would in many cases halve the incomes of asylum seekers and lead to a severe dip in their quality of life. "

	Despite an extensive search and over 100 applications, the Eritrean failed to find an apartment at the end of the temporary accommodation period in February.

	The commune was unwilling to help with the search and referred the young man to the emergency shelters run by the canton of Zurich, the Tages Anzeiger said.

	In a letter, the commune of Rafz said it was “reasonable” with the approach of spring for the teen to sleep outdoors. “You could buy a tent and a sleeping bag,” it wrote.

	The commune also stopped paying for the man to attend German language classes on the grounds that he needed to put all his energy into finding somewhere to live.

	The Zurich advisory service for asylum seekers, to which the man then turned in his desperation, said it appeared the commune wanted to force the social welfare recipient to move elsewhere.

With asylum centres filling up, Swiss artist and activist Almut Rembges has started using social networking sites like Facebook to help prevent refugee families from sleeping out in the cold this Christmas.  
Rembges, 37-year-old, began her campaign after finding a family sitting on the street outside Basel's asylum registration centre on a bitterly cold Sunday. 
They had just been told there was no space for additional refugees, meaning they would have to spend the night outdoors.
Rembges argued with the security guards, who finally granted the family admission. But the next day, they were back on the street, so she tried to find a better solution. 
She sent e-mails, called friends and posted on her Facebook account that there was a family in need. Soon, 25 people had offered to help and nine people were quickly sheltered, Tages Anzeiger reports.
The six members of the African family -- three women, two children and a young man -- ended up in the home of a well-known migrant rights activist. 
“Our guest room is quite spacious,” Anni Lanz told newspaper Le Matin. 
Since the Eritrean family's situation is no exception, Rembges regularly patrols the asylum centre in Basel to see if there are other refugees in need.
 To help coordinate the operation, she has set up an account with Doodle, a free online scheduling tool. Now, when asylum centres are full, she posts a message on Doodle seeking the assistance of friends and relatives.
According to humanitarian organizations, many asylum seekers have been turned away from official shelters in the cantons of Basel City, Vaud and Ticino, despite recent sub-zero temperatures. 
Some have been welcomed into private homes or have been put up by the Salvation Army, but many others have had to sleep in cold train stations.
Swiss television show ’10 vor 10’ reported that a Basel asylum centre had been forced to turn as many as 20 people away. The centre already gives shelter to 500 people despite only being kitted out for 320.
""We have no choice,"" said a spokesman for the Federal Office for Migration, who admits the situation has been particularly difficult in Basel over the last month. 
 Roger Lang, director of the asylum centre in Basel, also confirmed the problem. 
""It's true that we are overwhelmed, but for women and children, we  always find a solution,"" he told La Tribune de Genève.
Switzerland has seen asylum requests soar this year in the wake of popular uprisings in North Africa and the Middle East. By the end of November, the country had received 20,000 applications, 5,000 more than in the whole of 2010."

	The 64-year-old is an occasional volunteer preacher at the Ar'Rahman mosque in Biel/Bienne, said the paper. In a sermon recorded by SRF and attributed to the Libyan, he asked Allah to “destroy the enemies of our religion, destroy the Jews, the Christians, the Hindus, the Russians and the Shiites”.

	 

	The preacher came to Switzerland as a refugee in 1998 and was in 2001 granted asylum, claiming he was persecuted by the regime of Colonel Gadaffi. He now has a C permit granting permanent residence.

	 

	According to the Tages Anzeiger he has hardly worked during his time in Switzerland and has received nearly 600,000 francs in benefits over the past 13 years. 

	 

	The town of Nidau, where the Libyan lives, confirmed to the media including news agency ATS that he was a long-term client of the social services and that it supported an “immediate investigation of the serious accusations”. 

	 

	However it added that as a matter of principle social assistance is given irrespective of personal convictions “as long as these convictions are not relevant to criminal law”.  

	 

	On Wednesday ATS reported that the authorities in Biel/Bienne are considering making a criminal complaint against the preacher for his suspected hate speech. 

	 

	On August 3rd the man's refugee status was withdrawn by the Swiss migration office (SEM) since he had several times travelled to Libya and had a Libyan passport, said ATS.

	Since he no longer has the right to asylum, he is now subject to the provisions of the foreigners' law, meaning he could have his C permit withdrawn under certain conditions.

	Some 250,000 migrants have already crossed the Mediterranean this year to Italy and Greece, and the International Organization for Migration said Tuesday it expected that number to pass 300,000 by the end of the year.
	   
	The ones who make it to shore are the lucky ones, with 2,440 people having died trying so far this year, according to UNHCR.
	   
	That number includes the 49 migrants asphyxiated in the hold of a ship carrying 362 people that sank at the weekend.

	Italy said Tuesday eight suspected people smugglers had been arrested. They are accused of condemning the victims to their deaths by forcing them to stay in the ship's broiling, fume-filled hold.
	   
	Another five Syrian refugees reportedly died Tuesday and 24 were rescued when a boat overturned after leaving Turkey's Bodrum peninsula for the Greek island of Kos.

 Crisis on Greek isles 

	The surge in migrant numbers is most visible in debt-strapped Greece, which has largely failed to provide any support to the tens of thousands of migrants wallowing in squalid conditions.
	   
	""For months, UNHCR has been warning of a mounting refugee crisis on the Greek islands,"" Spindler said, insisting the ""reception infrastructure, services and registration procedures both on the islands and on the mainland need to be strengthened urgently.""
	   
	Until recently, most migrants making the perilous journey across the Mediterranean to Europe travelled to Italy, but dangers and logistical difficulties have shifted the flood increasingly towards Greece.
	   
	When the migrants arrive on the Greek islands there is little if anything for them and most have been forced to sleep outdoors.
	   
	The island of Kos, which last week witnessed chaotic scenes of overwhelmed police armed with truncheons beating back some of the thousands of people who had gathered there, has come to symbolize Europe's shambolic response to the refugee crisis.
	   
	Greece has taken some steps to address the problem, including sending a large ferry to Kos to serve as a registration and housing facility for refugees.
	   
	""The situation is still very complicated,"" UNHCR emergency coordinator Roberto Mignone told AFP on the island.
	   
	He said the authorities' ability to process the refugees remained low, with some 1,750 people currently on the ferry and another 2,500 still on the island.
	   
	With thousands more trapped on the island of Lesbos owing to a lack of ferry capacity at the height of the tourist season, Athens said Tuesday it would add another large ship to facilitate access to the mainland.
	   
	The financially struggling country has said the huge influx is too much for it to handle alone and has pleaded for more EU help.
	   
	The EU has approved 2.4 billion euros ($2.6 billion) of funding to help member states cope with the flood of migrants, but UNHCR has urged more help from the bloc for Greece, pointing out that ""the vast majority"" of the
	migrants there will travel on towards northern Europe.

	A full 60 percent of newly displaced people last year were in just five countries: Iraq, South Sudan, Syria, Democratic Republic of Congo and Nigeria.
	   
	Iraq was the hardest hit, with 2.2 million people forced to flee inside the country from areas seized by the brutal Islamic State group.
	   
	The jihadists also added to the horrors forcing people to leave their homes in neighbouring civil war-ravaged Syria.
	   
	Around one million more people were internally displaced in Syria last year, bringing the total number of IDPs there to 7.6 million, or 40 percent of the population.
	   
	Ukraine meanwhile appeared in IDMC's report for the first time, with 646,500 people internally displaced there in 2014 as the country was engulfed by fighting between pro-Russian separatists and Kiev forces.
	   
	Heavy fighting in South Sudan displaced 1.3 million people inside the world's youngest country, meaning 11 percent of its population became internally displaced in 2014.
	   
	Boko Haram's ruthless campaign to create an independent Islamic state in north-eastern Nigeria also drove hundreds of thousands from their homes, accounting for at least three quarters of the nearly one million people internally displaced in the country last year, the report said.
	   
	The report also highlighted the issue of long-lasting displacement, pointing out that in 2014, there were people who had been displaced for a decade or more in nearly 90 percent of the 60 countries monitored by IDMC.

 Despair

	""As new and renewed crises emerge in countries such as Ukraine or Iraq, new caseloads of internally displaced people join an already massive global displaced population who seem blocked from finding ways of ending their displacement,"" IDMC head Alfredo Zamudio said.
	   
	The UN refugee agency meanwhile warned that the staggering number of internally displaced people signalled hikes in refugee numbers too.
	   
	""The longer a conflict lasts, the more insecure (displaced people) feel and when hopelessness sets in, many will cross borders and become refugees,"" said Volker Turk, UNHCR's assistance head of protection.
	   
	This despair has helped create the deluge of people risking their lives to cross the Mediterranean to Europe.
	   
	More than 1,750 people have perished so far this year alone trying to reach Italy from lawless Libya.
	   
	Libya, which has become a transit country for migrants and refugees from severals conflicts, saw its own internal displacement balloon six-fold last year to at least 400,000, IDMC said.
	   
	""Despair drives people to take their chances and even risk dangerous boat journeys,"" Turk said, calling for ""an all-out effort to bring about peace in war-ravaged countries.""

	Ulukaya, a 43-year-old Turkish Kurd who moved to the United States as a student in 1994 and made a fortune there with his Greek-style Chobani yogurts, said governments and other organizations could not resolve the global refugee crisis without the corporate world's help.
	   
	On the opening day of a five-day gathering in Davos, the Tent Foundation, which he set up to aid refugees, launched a pledge campaign for companies to give money or jobs to refugees, with early sign-ups including Airbnb, the Ikea Foundation, LinkedIn, MasterCard, and UPS.

	""If we're going to give hope and opportunity to the more than 60 million refugees around the world, it must come from more than just governments and NGOs,"" said Ulukaya said.
	   
	""Businesses and innovators have a critical role to play,"" he added.
	   
	""The refugee crisis is not only unprecedented in scale, it is a humanitarian challenge that is dynamic and ever-evolving, with wide-ranging implications for refugees, host communities and the global community.""
	   
	European Union nations are struggling to come up with a clear plan to cope with the arrival of more than a million refugees and migrants last year, in the worst migration crisis to hit the continent since the Second World War.
	   
	Many of them are Syrians fleeing the brutal civil war that has seen the country's neighbours take in millions of refugees since it broke out in 2011.

				Too many Eritrean asylum seekers are arriving in Lucerne, according to the cantonal authorities, who have sent a letter of complaint about Switzerland's ""overly generous"" asylum policy to Swiss President Simonetta Sommaruga.			

	Signed by Lucerne's cantonal social affairs minister, Guido Graf, the letter speaks of the “massive rise” in the number of asylum seekers, reported newspaper Le Temps.

	Eritrea's economic difficulties and compulsory military service do not justify the granting of refugee status in Switzerland; instead, “the massive exile is encouraged by our too generous asylum policy,” the letter said. 

	In June, 122 out of 167 asylum applicants in the canton of Lucerne came from Eritrea, according to Le Temps.

	President Sommaruga should “check if these nationals are really in danger when they return to their country. If the threat is confirmed, there could be grounds for provisional admission [to Switzerland],” Lucerne authorities said in the letter.

	The letter continued: “We consider that the current practice of granting refugee status to people who are not physically threatened at the moment of their escape is wrong.”

	The letter also drew attention to the number of unaccompanied minors from Eritrea.

	“For us that's proof that they are leaving their country for economic reasons, and not because of imminent threat.”

	The letter outlines the difficulties in accommodating such children and demands more financial compensation from the Swiss federal government.

	The latest statistics from the State Secretariat for Migration (SEM) showed that Switzerland received nearly 12,000 asylum applications between January and June this year, up 16 percent on the same period last year.

	More than half were Eritreans arriving from southern Italy, joining more than 20,000 already in Switzerland – the largest such group outside the North African country.

	Pius Betschart, deputy director of the Federal Office for Migration told the Schweiz am Sonntag newspaper that Eritrean applications tend to be successful.

	“The vast majority of the Eritreans are in need of protection under Swiss law,” he said.

	The human rights situation in Eritrea has long been on the agenda of the United Nations.

	On June 24th a statement by United Nations Special Rapporteur Sheila Keetharuth highlighted human rights abuses in Eritrea.

	Forced evictions and the bulldozing of houses are an ongoing practice in the country, she said.

	She also drew attention to the plight of unaccompanied minors crossing the Mediterranean who are “at risk of falling prey to many forms of abuse, including sexual, economic and criminal”.

	Speaking to UK newspaper The Guardian last year Keetharuth said: “My work has highlighted the lack of rule of law, breaches of fundamental rights, with scores of reported cases of extrajudicial executions, enforced disappearances, arbitrary detention and torture in detention – all of which give reasons to Eritreans to flee.

	“The protracted national service, under conditions that often turn it into forced labour and create a fertile ground for other violations, is another compelling one.”

	In October last year Eritreans were given refuge at the famous Einsiedeln monastery in northern Switzerland after an influx of asylum seekers caused all other reception centres in the area to be full.

	Lisa Bosia Mirra, a Socialist party MP in Ticino's parliament, was arrested on Thursday at an unguarded border point at Stabio along with a 53-year-old man from the canton of Bern, police said in a statement.

	The man was driving a van with Bern licence plates that contained four African refugee minors, said the statement. Mirra, in another car, is thought to have met them at the border.

	They were both arrested just before 9am on Thursday after entering Swiss territory.

	Mirra was released later that day but police said in a second statement she is “still under in investigation for breach of the Foreigners Act, in particular aiding and abetting illegal entry”.

	The man who was driving the van remains in custody.

	According to news agencies Mirra is the founder of a refugee aid organization, Firdaus, and has been critical of Switzerland's treatment of refugee children trying to enter the country at the border with Italy at Chiasso.

	She also works with SOS Ticino, a non-profit aimed at promoting social justice with a particular focus on migration.

	Switzerland has been under fire in recent weeks for turning back migrants, including children, at the border if they do not claim asylum.

	The authorities want to stop the country becoming a route for migrants in transit who wish to pass through Switzerland and claim asylum in Germany.

	As a result, thousands of refugees have been turned back from Chiasso and have ended up camping out in the Italian city of Como.

	Human rights groups including Amnesty International have expressed concern that child migrants wanting to reach family members already in Switzerland are being prevented from doing so.

	And the Swiss Refugee Council recently said confusion at the border was making it difficult for refugees to claim asylum.

	The Swiss border guards need to put more translators and child protection specialists in place to ensure those seeking to lodge an asylum request are able to do so, it said.

				Ten million people worldwide have no nationality, leaving them in a devastating legal limbo, the Geneva-based UN refugee agency said on Tuesday, launching a campaign to eradicate statelessness within a decade.			
  ""Every ten minutes a new stateless person is born,"" UN refugee chief Antonio Guterres told reporters in Geneva, describing the situation as ""absolutely unacceptable"" and ""an anomaly in the 21st century.""       With its ""I Belong"" campaign, UNHCR aims to highlight the ""devastating life-long consequences of statelessness"" and push countries to rectify their laws to ensure no person is denied a nationality.       ""Often they are excluded from cradle to grave, being denied a legal identity when they are born, access to education, health care, marriage and job opportunities during their lifetime and even the dignity of an official burial and a death certificate when they die,"" the agency said in its report.       ""Statelessness makes people feel like their very existence is a crime,"" Guterres said.       People can become stateless due to a range of reasons, like discrimination based on ethnicity, religion or gender, or when a nation state falls apart.    War and conflict also often make it difficult to register births.       The report does not count the case of the Palestinians, since the UN General Assembly had recognised the State of Palestine, Guterres said.       The problem for many of the 4.5 million of Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza and the millions more living as refugees around the world is that the State of Palestine has yet to approve its nationality laws, he said, insisting that this ""very specific situation"" required a ""political solution"".       The largest number of stateless people are to be found in Myanmar, which denies citizenship to some one million Rohingya Muslims, according to Guterres.       Myanmar considers the Rohingya illegal migrants from Bangladesh, which in turn considers the ones who cross the border illegal migrants from Myanmar.       In both countries, the group viewed by the UN as one of the world's most persecuted peoples faces widespread restrictions, including curbs on movement, education and marriage.       When nation states break apart, people are often also left in limbo, with more than 600,000 people for instance still left stateless after the disintegration of the Soviet Union more than 20 years ago.       In situations of war, conflict and turmoil, it also often becomes difficult to register births, especially among refugees, leaving them stateless.       A full 70 percent of babies born to Syrian refugees in neighbouring Lebanon and Jordan have for instance not received legal birth certificates, Guterres said.       A number of countries, including Iran and Qatar, also deny women the right to pass their nationality on to their children on an equal basis with men, ""a situation that can create chains of statelessness that span generations,"" UNHCR warned.    'Statelessness is inhuman'       The world's perhaps most famous stateless person was Albert Einstein, who remained stateless from 1896, when he renounced his German citizenship, until 1901, when he became Swiss.       In an open letter, Guterres, UNHCR special envoy and Hollywood star Angelina Jolie, UN rights chief Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein, Nobel Peace Prize laureates Shirin Ebadi and Desmond Tutu and others described what living without a nationality can mean.       ""Statelessness can mean a life without education, without medical care or legal employment,"" the letter said, adding: ""Statelessness is inhuman. We believe it is time to end this injustice.""       The campaign aims to gather ten million signatures with the petition in its bid to eradicated statelessness within the next ten years.       The good news, UNHCR said, was that much progress had already been made towards resolving the issue, with more than four million stateless people gaining a nationality in the past decade due to legislative and policy changes.       A court ruling in Bangladesh in 2008 had for instance allowed 300,000 stateless Urdu-speakers to become citizens.       ""Unlike many armed conflicts, it is wholly within the power of every concerned government to resolve statelessness,"" Guterres said.

				The United Nations' top official in charge of
migration said in Geneva on Tuesday that the crisis rocking Europe needs a ""global response"", insisting that countries worldwide must be asked to do their share.			

	""We should have a European response as part of a global response,"" UN Special Representative for Migration and Development Peter Sutherland told reporters in the Swiss city, hinting at the need for an international conference ""where every country is held up to the spotlight.""

	Europe is dealing with hundreds of thousands of migrants — many of them fleeing violence in places like Syria — pouring across the Mediterranean and taking a land route up through the continent.

	Syria's neighbours are meanwhile struggling to host more than four million refugees from the war-ravaged country.

	Sutherland insisted geographical proximity to a crisis should not determine who takes in refugees, pointing out that during the Vietnam War, refugees were welcomed into countries around the globe.

	The same, he said, was true following the Hungarian revolution in 1956, when an international conference was held to help distribute the some 200,000 people who fled the Soviet crackdown.

	He called for ""a much more proactive response by the international community.""

	""We have to find a method, perhaps as we did in 1956 in the conference that took place then, to get specific commitments from every state in regard to taking refugees,"" he added.

	He also insisted on a system to evaluate who constitutes a refugee that is consistent across all nations, noting that at present, different countries are using different criteria.

Defining moment for Europe

	Sutherland also stressed that sending aid money to help Syrians at home or in the region should not be seen by governments as a substitute to taking in a fair share of refugees.

	""Buying your way out of this is not satisfactory,"" he said, pointing out that a number of the wealthy Gulf states had been very generous in their contributions, but had taken in very few refugees.

	The same, he said, is true of the United States and Britain.

	Sutherland called for a much fairer distribution of the refugee burden within Europe, pointing out that only five European countries have taken 72 percent of all refugees, while others take ""virtually none"".

	He was especially critical of Hungary, which instead of welcoming refugees is building an anti-migrant fence along its southern border.

	""History will judge this as a defining moment for Europe, a Europe that proclaimed itself to be created on the principle of values,"" he said.

	Sutherland also stressed that far more resources needed to be channelled into the UN agencies and other organisations trying handle the refugee crisis and the humanitarian impact of Syria's war.

	The UN refugee agency warned Tuesday that increasingly brutal fighting in Syria and the dire underfunding of aid operations aimed to help the refugees in neighbouring countries are pushing many to risk the perilous journey to Europe.

	""For the vast majority, who are not living in formal camps, hope is dwindling as they sink ever deeper into abject poverty,"" UNHCR spokeswoman Melissa Fleming said.

	The UN's World Food Programme (WFP) meanwhile, said severe underfunding had forced it to halve its food assistance to 1.3 million Syrian refugees, most of whom are now living on the equivalent of 50 US cents per day.

	It has cut out food assistance altogether to 229,000 refugees in Jordan and 131,000 in Lebanon, as it tries to focus on feeding the most vulnerable.

				A leading Swiss politician said people fleeing conflict should only receive temporary protection in Switzerland, calling for a rethinking of the country's approach to asylum seekers in an interview published Sunday.			

""People displaced by war should still be taken in but only with the aim of sending them back later when the situation in their country of origin allows it,"" Philipp Müller, leader of the influential centre-right Liberal party (FDP), told the Schweiz am Sonntag paper.
	   
	""People attempting to enter for economic reasons must be rejected,"" Müller added.

	Noting ""chaos"" on the Greek island of Kos, where thousands of migrants mainly from Syria and Iraq have turned up in recent weeks, Müller said Switzerland needed to refocus on the issue of migrants.

	He said too many people have been granted permanent refugee status in Switzerland in recent years and not nearly enough have been ordered to return home.

	He specifically cited Sri Lanka, where a 25-year civil war ended in 2009.

	""Asylum-seekers are still not being sent back there although the country has become a tourism destination for Swiss people. That is absurd,"" Müller said.
	   
	In a review of Switzerland concluded this week, the United Nations Committee against Torture voiced concern that the federation ""is not sufficiently considering"" circumstances in the country of origin before sending migrants home.

	The UN panel specifically noted two reported cases of ethnic Tamils being subjected to torture after being forcibly returned to Sri Lanka.

	Switzerland, known for its tame political climate, goes to the polls on October 18.

	As in the rest of Europe, migrant and refugee policy has increasingly become a source of debate in the country.

	Justice minister and current Swiss President Simonetta Sommaruga earlier this month said it was ""unthinkable"" that Switzerland would return people to Eritrea, which is led by authoritarian regime.

	She was responding to criticism from the right-wing Swiss People's Party that the government's handling of Eritrean migrants was too lenient, a complaint echoed by Müller.

	After several attempts to find a political solution, De Mistura in July proposed a fresh approach whereby Syrians would take part in ""thematic"" working groups.
	   
	The envoy met with the heads of these groups over the last two days, seeking to ""set the stage for a Syrian agreement to end the conflict,"" De Mistura's office said in a statement.
	   
	The group heads include Jan Egeland, a former top UN official and current chair of the Norwegian Refugee Council who will lead the safety and protection group, as well as Nicolas Michel, a Swiss national and former UN legal counsel, in charge of the group on political and legal affairs.
	   
	Also named was Volker Perthes, a German academic and Syria specialist who will focus on the military and counter-terrorism, with the fourth group headed by Sweden's Birgitta Holst Alani, who will lead the group on reconstructing the country.
	   
	De Mistura said he hopes these groups can lay the groundwork before representatives of the various factions in Syria join the talks.
	   
	But Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's regime has reportedly warned him the outcomes of the working groups cannot be binding.
	   
	The conflict among Assad's forces and various rebel groups including Islamist extremists has killed nearly a quarter of a million people since 2011 and forced more than four million to flee the country.

	Millions more have been displaced within Syria.
	   
	Hundreds of thousands of Syrian refugees have reached Greece this year, fuelling Europe's migrant crisis and leading to growing calls for a political solution to end the fighting.

				A Sudanese man has won his appeal against deportation from Switzerland after the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) said deporting him would violate his human right not to be tortured. 			

	The man in question, known only as A.I., arrived in Switzerland in 2012 and lodged an asylum request, the ECHR said in a press release.

	 

	He claimed that since secondary school he had been a member of a militant organization defending the rights of minorities in Darfur, Sudan. Since 2005 he had also been a member of armed opposition group the Justice and Equality Movement (JEM). 

	 

	After being interviewed, the Swiss migration office (SEM) decided he did not meet the criteria of a refugee and therefore ordered him to be deported.

	 

	He then lost an appeal at the Swiss civil court before taking his case to the ECHR, claiming he ran a risk of being persecuted over his political activities if sent back.

	 

	In its judgement on Tuesday the ECHR said that “despite certain inconsistencies” there was no reason to doubt the credibility of his claims concerning his political activities. 

	 

	It was not therefore unreasonable to think he was on the radar of the Sudanese intelligence services and consequently there were “reasonable grounds” to think he ran the risk of being detained, interrogated and tortured on his arrival at Khartoum airport. 

	 

	Deporting him would violate articles three and two of the European Convention on Human Rights which ban torture and protect the right to life, it said.

	In a second case related to another Sudanese man, the ECHR ruled in favour of Switzerland, saying the man, known as N.A., was not at risk of being tortured or ill-treated on his return. 

	 

	The man, who also arrived in Switzerland in 2012, washed cars for a living and claimed to have been stopped and searching by the authorities for washing the car of a member of the JEM. He said he had been interrogated and ill-treated for 45 days and then imprisoned for five days. 

	 

	But since his political activities in exile were limited he was not likely to be monitored by the Sudanese intelligence services, said the court.

				A new court ruling opens the door for the deportation of Eritreans who have failed in their bid to win asylum in Switzerland even if they if they face national service back home. 			


		In a statement dated July 10th, Switzerland's Federal Administrative Court (FAC) stated deporting failed Eritrean asylum seekers who had not carried out compulsory military service was ""both lawful and reasonable"".  



		The new ruling is the latest setback for Eritreans who have seen their bid for asylum in Switzerland rejected.

Read also: Eritreans in Bern protest against tough new asylum rules 



		It comes after an Eritrean man appealed a deportation order arguing he would face national service on his return home. 



		Examining the man's appeal, the FAC addressed the issue of whether military service in the African nation constituted forced labour – something which is banned by the European Court of Human Rights (EHCR) and which would therefore make the man's deportation impossible. 



		The court noted that the length of public of military service in Eritrea was ""hardly predictable and varies between five and ten years on average"" and added that ""various sources report cases of abuse and sexual assault."" 



		But the court concluded that ""although the reported conditions in Eritrean national service are difficult, they are not so severe as to make deportation unlawful."" 



		The FAC went on to state the ""ECHR only forbids deportation if there are reasonable grounds to believe that there is a real risk of a flagrant breach of the prohibition of forced labour.""

		The court said the ""abuse and sexual assault are not sufficiently widespread to have any bearing on this assessment"", adding that it did not feel that ""anyone returning to Eritrea voluntarily faces a real risk of detention or any accompanying inhumane treatment"". 



		The latest FAC ruling further increases the pressure on the around 9,400 Eritreans living in Switzerland on temporary residence permits. 



		In August last year, the St Gallen-based court ruled it was reasonable to return Eritrean citizens who had already previously performed military service to the African country as they were unlikely either to be required to re-join the military or to face other punishment. 



		In theory that ruling could lead to up to 3,200 Eritreans being deported.



		The Federal Administrative Court had initially toughened its stance against Eritrean asylum seekers in February 2017 when it slammed shut an open-door policy toward Eritreans which had automatically granted them refugee status. 



		Switzerland currently has no treaty with Eritrea regarding the return of migrants but State Secretary for Migration Mario Gattiker said in April that this did not mean such returns were not possible. 



		Switzerland only has a returns treaty with every second country, he said, and while Eritrea does not accept the forced return of migrants, voluntary returns were possible, he told Switzerland’s Le Temps newspaper.

Initial reports that the asylum seekers would be barred from the public pool, gyms and even the town library and churches sparked outrage and charges of segregation and discrimination from rights activists.       Swiss migration authorities maintain the reports were based on a misunderstanding, insisting the asylum seekers will only have restricted access to so-called ""sensitive areas"" where access is also restricted to the Swiss public, like schools and sports facilities during school hours.       The rules were merely aimed to help ""organize the cohabitation between the asylum seekers and the town population"", Federal Migration Office spokeswoman Gaby Szoelloesy told AFP.       Denise Graf of Amnesty International's Swiss section was unconvinced, maintaining that the rules, which require asylum seekers to among other things request permission from the town before accessing the pool, ""are clearly discriminatory"".       And Bremgarten is not the only place where asylum seekers face such discrimination, she said, accusing Bern of making any number of concessions to avoid protests from the communities chosen to house a growing number of temporary asylum centres.       Residents in one centre near the central city of Lucerne had for instance been barred from taking the shortest route to the train station, while other centres impose strict curfews, she said.       Police meanwhile moved in this week to remove ten asylum seekers who had been camped out for days at the Solothurn train station in northwestern Switzerland to protest their living conditions in a subterranean bunker they described as ""unworthy of a human being"".       Switzerland is one of the countries in Europe that welcomes the most asylum seekers in proportion to its population, with some 48,000 people currently in the process of applying for asylum in the small Alpine nation, including 28,631 who arrived in 2012 -- the highest number since 1999.       Amid the recent spike in refugees, Switzerland has been rushing to open a slew of temporary asylum centres.       But the Swiss public, which in June overwhelmingly voted to tighten the country's asylum laws, often resist the creation of such centres in their neighbourhoods.       Szoelloesy acknowledged that four of the ten communities asked to host new centres since last year had been granted the right to set up ""sensitive areas"", like Bremgarten, to help avoid ""bad feelings"" towards the asylum seekers.       She echoed Justice Minister Simonetta Sommaruga's claim last week that in Switzerland, ""fundamental rights are not negotiable"", and insisted: ""our asylum system is fair and humane"".       Gerry Simpson, senior refugee researcher for Human Rights Watch, welcomed Sommaruga's statement, saying he hoped it meant the rules agreed upon in Bremgarten ""may now be revised, and that they won't be repeated elsewhere in Switzerland"".       ""Ninety-nine percent of (asylum seekers) are law-abiding people who just want to live their lives . . . so I don't think (there is a need) to assuage fears with special measures,"" he said.   ""They just need to treat them lawfully and fairly.""       The ten Solothurn demonstrators, who spent five days protesting their living conditions in a windowless military shelter with insufficient ventilation in the nearby village of Kestenholz, do not feel they have been treated fairly in Switzerland.       ""There's no air, no windows and 30 people sleeping together . . . that's not the way it should be,"" Turkish Kurd Abdullah Ochalan complained to public Swiss radio RTS before the protesters were cleared out of the train station early Tuesday.       Graf decried the increased use of such shelters.   They are ""underground, they stink, there's no air, no light, and its always noisy"", she said.       ""For people who have been traumatised especially it is horrific.""       Not everyone shares her sympathy.       ""To tell you the truth, I think that if they are not satisfied with the laws in the country that is housing them they would be better off returning to their countries or going elsewhere,"" young Solothurn local Maria told RTS.

				The Geneva-based UN refugee agency on Tuesday accused Sri Lanka of breaking international law in its growing campaign to kick out Pakistani asylum seekers without a fair hearing.			
  ""Fundamentally, this is a breach of the principle of no forced returns,"" said Adrian Edwards, spokesman for the UN high commissioner for refugees (UNHCR).   ""That's a clear violation of international law.""    Sri Lanka has deported 88 Pakistanis since August 1st, despite claims that they could be at risk in their homeland, Edwards said.       Starting with men who had been placed in detention, the country has widened the net to cover whole families, he told reporters.       ""We are very concerned at the continued deportations that are happening,"" Edwards said.   ""We want deportations stopped.""       In all, there are now 11 women and eight children among the deported, Edwards said.       ""Some of the latest deportees had their passports and asylum-seeker certificates seized last week,"" he said.   ""They were told to go to Colombo airport, where they were placed on flights to Pakistan.""       Edwards added that UNHCR staff had also heard of families being separated — including a man sent home over a week ago and whose pregnant wife remains in Sri Lanka.       Hundreds of Pakistani Christians fleeing persecution have been arriving in Sri Lanka in search of a haven.       Sri Lanka has defended its crackdown, saying a state's responsibility under international law had to be ""nuanced and balanced in the context of domestic compulsions"".       Edwards could not immediately give details about the background of the deportees but said UNHCR guidelines stipulate that asylum claims from Pakistan's Christian, Ahmadiyya Muslim and Shia Muslim minorities should be given particularly careful attention.       He said UNHCR also wants access to 157 asylum seekers — including 84 Pakistanis, 71 Afghans and two Iranians — who remain in detention in Sri Lanka.       ""These recent developments have heightened anxiety among the refugee and asylum-seeker population in Sri Lanka,"" Edwards said.

				The head of the cantonal government of Ticino is warning that the border with Italy will have to be closed to refugees to stem the tide of asylum seekers entering Switzerland.			

	“If the influx of refugees from Italy continues, we will have to temporarily close the border,” Norman Gobbi, the Ticino government's president told NZZ am Sonntag.

	“It's the only way for Switzerland to put pressure on other countries that do not respect their obligations,” Gobbi said.

	He said the number of asylum seekers and illegal immigrants crossing the border from Italy had doubled from a year ago

	Gobbi complaind that Swiss authorities “were doing work for Italy and the European Union, notably with the identification of migrants.”

	He said that when its comes to asylum seekers, Ticino has become the “southern border of Germany”.

	Gobbi suggested the pressure had only risen since France decided to close its border to refugees travelling from Italy.

	But he was particularly critical of Italy for not honouring the Dublin Regulation, which requires that the first country in the EU where an asylum seeker arrives is responsible for dealing with his or her claim.

	Since the beginning of the year more than 50,000 refugees have arrived in Italy after crossing the Mediterranean in boats.

	From January to May 2015, Swiss border guards in Ticino have apprehended 3,150 people for unlawful stay in Switzerland, a spokesman for the border guards told NZZ am Sonntag.

	Most of them came from the African countries of Eritrea, Somalia, Gambia, Nigeria and Senegal, as well as Kosovo.

	The State Secretariat for Migration informed cantonal governments that the number of asylum seekers will continue to rise this year, NZZ am Sonntag said, citing a confidential document.

	Over the summer, the level of monthly requests is expected to surpass 3,000.

	“For this reason it cannot be excluded that in 2015 more than 30,000 people will apply for asylum,” the document reportedly says.

	That's the highest level since 1999.

	The overwhelming majority — 95 percent — of migrants arrive in Switzerland by train, according to Swiss border guards.

	Many are deported to Italy, but “repatriation is a problem because Italian authorities are not prepared for it”, Gobbi said.

					11:07 CEST+02:00				", The Local,Five Swiss cantons to extend pilot scheme to offer jobs in agriculture to refugees,"
				The trial phase launched in 2015 saw 30 refugees or people on short term visas trained and employed in farming jobs in the last three years. The project was largely deemed successful by its evaluators and will now be extended until 2022. 			

	The project 'Working with farmers' was launched by the Swiss Union of Farmers and the Swiss State Secretariat for Migration in 2015 and aimed to solve two problems: Integrating refugees and filling the employment gap in Switzerland's farming and livestock sectors.

	Of 45 trial places that were made available on the program, 30 were filled. Each worker received 3,200 Swiss francs (€2,772) per month and an additional 200 Swiss francs (€173) for successfully overcoming the required bureaucratic hurdles. 21 of the 30 participants received further work or a permanent contract at the end of the trial phase. The project cost 280,000 Swiss francs (€242,000) over three years to implement. 

	Following a review of the project by the School of Agricultural, Forest and Food Sciences (HAFL) in the canton of Bern, the scheme will now be extended until 2022, according to a statement issued by the Swiss government's portal on August 8th. 

	The evaluator's report noted that the participants' language abilities improved throughout the scheme, as did their social and professional skills, according to the employers.

	The national nature of the project however entailed a large amount of coordination and red tape, according to the organisers. Participants often had no driving license or vehicle and faced difficulties getting to and from work in rural areas. The report also notes that the ""familiarization"" phase was ""complicated"" – many of the participants were not accustomed to the rhythms of agricultural life and language and culture barriers took time to erode. 



	 

	The Swiss Union of Farmers made several suggestions to improve the project. Coordination should be at a cantonal level, refugees should be supported to live outside of the farms, language courses should be provided in parallel, while employers should be sensitized to the refugees' situations. 

	Five cantons – Bern, Aargau, Ticino, Friburg and Neuchâtel – have proposed that the project nevertheless be extended from August 2018 and that participants be offered the opportunity to receive formal training at a Swiss agricultural institute before starting their job. Twelve refugees will begin a course in mid-August at the Inforama Rütti adult education centre just outside the Swiss capital Bern. 

	The largest number by far of agri-food chain employers are in Bern, followed by the cantons of Lucerne, St Gallen and Zurich respectively.  

	The preparation for apprenticeships in agriculture will form part of a national migration policy that will see between 800 and 1,200 refugees and residents on short term stays trained for positions in the Swiss labour market in ten different sectors by 2022. 

	""At the end of this training, refugees will have a good overview of the world of work in agriculture,"" says the government's statement.

	In 2017, Switzerland raised more than 11,000 chickens in the poultry sector.  The number of poultry raised doubled between 2000 and 2016, according to the latest data from Switzerland's Federal Office of Statistics.

	More than a million tonnes of sugar beet, the most farmed vegetable, were harvested in 2016. Most livestock and crops are for domestic consumption, not for export, part of a food security policy undertaken by the Swiss government. 

	With Swiss employees representing less than 35 per cent of the total workforce in Swiss agriculture, the agri-food chain nevertheless relies on foreign workers. The average age of farm workers in 2017 was 50 to 59, a statistic which only emphasizes how unattractive the sector is to the younger workforce. In 2015, 547,000 jobs – 11 per cent of the total 5 million in Switzerland – were linked to the agri-food chain's 100,000 establishments. 

	Lofty figures, but employment in the agricultural sector has dramatically fallen in recent decades. In 2013, agriculture in Switzerland employed half the number of people it did in 1975, according to an earlier report by the Swiss government.

					11:04 CET+01:00				", The Local,Swiss village that refused refugees has change of heart,"
				The commune of Oberwil-Lieli, which earlier this year chose to pay a hefty fee rather than take its share of refugees, has had a change of heart. 			

	The town council of the village in the canton of Aargau said on Friday it would welcome a Christian family of five asylum seekers from Syria in January, reported Swiss media.  

	The council has asked the population of 2,200 residents to come forward if they have vacant accommodation to offer to the family, said news agencies, however as yet no one has done so.

	Oberwil-Lieli, one of the richest places in Switzerland, hit the headlines in May this year when its residents voted in favour of paying 290,000 francs a year to the canton instead of agreeing to house  their allocation of just ten asylum seekers.

	The decision caused bitter divisions within the village but was supported by its mayor, Andreas Glarner, a Swiss People’s Party (SVP) hardliner.

	Glarner said at the time it was the “civil duty” of Swiss citizens to “resist” the Swiss government’s policy on refugees, which stipulates that all cantons should house a share of the total number of asylum seekers accepted by Switzerland.

	“Switzerland must close all of its green borders with barbed wire,” he said.

	Despite this change of heart – which the council said residents did not object to – the village is still five people short of fulfilling its obligations.

	The other five asylum seekers who should be housed in Oberwil-Lieli will instead be taken on by a nearby commune, said the council.

	The village will also give a sum of 50,000 francs to a private organization helping refugees in Greece and Turkey, it added.

	Last year the Swiss federal government said it would accept 3,000 refugees from Syria over a three-year period.

	According to the latest figures from the Swiss Migration Office (SEM), the number of people requesting asylum in Switzerland is slowing.

	In October 2,096 asylum applications were lodged, 4.1 percent fewer than in September and nearly 56 percent fewer than the same time last year.

	The majority of asylum seekers in Switzerland are from Eritrea.

				Amnesty International slammed Switzerland on Wednesday for ill treatment of refugees and asylum seekers, inhumane conditions for inmates of a Geneva prison and inadequate measures against racial discrimination.
			

	Amnesty’s charges appeared on Wednesday in its annual report for 2014-15, which underlined concerns raised in the past year by the Swiss National Commission for the Prevention of Torture (NCPT) and various NGOs.

	The NCPT said people facing deportation faced excessive use of force when being moved from detention centres for asylum seekers to airports.

	The commission said police force practices varied from one canton to another and that uniform national standards were needed.

	The report highlighted problems with forced deportations, citing a case of two Tamil asylum seekers from Switzerland who were sent to Sri Lanka in 2013 only to end up in detention there before being transferred to a “rehabilitation” camp.

	Amnesty noted that after temporarily halting forced returns to Sri Lanka, the Federal Office for Migration in May last year announced it would review cases of asylum seekers from that country whose applications were rejected, but resumed deportations.

	The report also drew attention to inhumane conditions at Geneva’s Champ-Dollon prison, which as of November 2014 held 811 inmates “in a space designed to accommodate 376”.

	Switzerland’s supreme court ruled a year ago that two prisoners held at Champ-Dollon were subjected to conditions that breached the European Convention on Human Rights.

	The two prisoners “were held consecutively for three months, confined for 23 hours per day with four other detainees in a cell measuring 23 square metres designed for three inmates, without access to any activities”.

	Disturbances at the prison in February 2014 resulted in injuries to eight guards and about 30 prisoners.

	The Amnesty report also zeroes in on racial discrimination concerns in Switzerland.

	A committee of the UN Human Rights Council has urged the Swiss government to “introduce a clear and comprehensive definition of direct and indirect racial discrimination covering all fields of law”, it said.

	The report referred to a ruling in November 2015 by the administrative court of the canton of Saint Gallen that found a school ban on a Muslim student wearing a headscarf as “disproportionate”.

	Globally, Amnesty International derided what it called a “devastating year for those seeking to stand up fro human rights and for those caught up in the suffering of war zones”.

	Governments pay lip service to the importance of protecting civilians but the world’s politicians “have miserably failed to protect those in greatest need,” Salil Shetty, the organization’s secretary general said in the report.

	That needs to change, he said, noting that civilians have borne the brunt of conflicts around the world.

	The report looks at rights violations in a such hotspots as Syria, Iraq, Ukraine, Afghanistan and Nigeria.

	“We must hope that, looking backward to 2014 in the years to come, what we lived through will be seen as the ultimate low point from which we rose up and created a better future“, Shetty said.

					13:03 CEST+02:00				",Alex Macbeth,IN PICTURES: Switzerland's fight to save its fish from the heatwave,"
				With extensive mesures being taken across Swiss water bodies to save fish in the midst of the extreme heatwave, The Local spoke to the Swiss Fishing Federation to find out how serious the situation is and what is being done to safeguard fish species. 			

	""We are extremely worried,"" Philipp Sicher, head of the Swiss Fishing Federation (FSP), said in a statement late last month about the plight of fish in the current heatwave. ""Indicators show that tragedy is near,"" added Sicher.  

	The same warning noted that when water temperatures reach between 23 and 25 degrees Celsius, the situation becomes ""critical"" for fish. Last weekend the temperature in parts of the Rhine river reached 27.6 degrees. 

	""All waters are affected by the heatwave,"" Eva Baier, water protection expert at the Swiss Fishing Federation, told The Local. ""In the canton of Zurich alone, we've had to fish out and relocate the animals from 150 creeks across several hundred kilometres of watercourses,"" added Baier. 

	A tonne of fish have already died in the Rhine in the canton of Schaffhausen alone, according to officials. In the canton of Thurgau, farmers there face a ban on pumping surface water as of the end of last month.

	Baier and her team use several techniques to attempt to safeguard fish species vulnerable to the rise in water temperatures. 

	""In smaller waters, the animals are fished out using electric-fanned equipment and moved into surrounding cooler waters or, in emergency cases, to fish farms,"" says Baier. 

	 

	This involves using nets with electric charge, to which the fish are attracted, according to a piece in Swiss news portal Tagezanzeiger. This technique causes fish substantial stress, however, and is only used in extreme cases. 

	 

	A preferred option is to cool the temperature of the water artificially. ""In some stretches the water is aired so that enough oxygen is present,"" Baier told The Local.

	""In other cases, cool water zones are created in which cooler streams are dredged and groundwater springs are placed under protection,"" adds Baier. 

	 

	Salmonids such as trout and grayling suffer the most under such intense heat, explains Baier.

	The Swiss Fishing Federation's rescue efforts in the face of one of the hottest and driest summers on record in Switzerland face several challenges. ""The larger rivers, which have little shading, are essentially straight and have few protective structures – such as deadwood accumulations which act as safe havens for fish – make it hard to give the fish relief,"" Baier told The Local.

	The numbers speak for themselves. ""On the Rhine between Lake Constance and Schaffhausen the situation inthe warm waters of Lake Constance is particularly precarious. There has been more than one tonne of dead fish removed, especially grayling,"" says Baier.

	While the current heatwave is largely responsible for the plight of fish, human activity has contributed to the warming waters and the stress for several species. 

	 


		""Swiss waters are under very high pressure in terms of usage,"" Baier told The Local. ""The water is used for energy production, for irrigation, as drinking water, for leisure activities (swimming, sailing, fishing, excursion boats), as cooling water and for sanitation. All these activities taken together – including the warming effect caused by human-induced climate change – put the fish under enormous pressure,"" added the expert. 

		 

		In many areas of the Upper Rhine Valley, safety zones have been created and swimming and sailing temporarily forbidden.

		Switzerland's nuclear power plants are also contributing to the fish's existential crisis. ""All installations that use rivers for cooling and then return water to the watercourse contribute to the warming. Nuclear power plants have a significant impact in that respect,"" says Baier.

	Despite the best efforts to curtail human activity in some of the most vulnerable bodies of water, the relocation and fanning efforts and the creation of cool water basin safety zones, in many areas nature, or man-made disaster, has simply taken its course.

	 

	""Several smaller water bodies are almost or completely dried up,"" Baier told The Local. At this stage it isn't possible to calculate the total number of fish that have died, she added. 

	 

	Approximately 70 species of fish live in Switzerland's water bodies, of which 54 are indigenous, according to fishfinder.ch. 

	 

	A petition by the Swiss Fishing Federation, Aqua Viva and the WWF aims to lobby the government to implement ""structural measures at power plants, so that fish can safely migrate upstream and downstream.""

				Hope and human resilience are the guiding themes of the new permanent exhibit at Geneva's International Red Cross and Red Crescent Museum, which reopens its doors to the public this weekend after a nearly two-year makeover.			
 ""It was important to have the museum be a museum of hope, to show that it is possible to rebuild a new life after living through something very dramatic,"" director Roger Mayou told AFP after showing off the revamped exhibition to journalists ahead of the official reopening on Saturday.      The new museum, flanked by the ICRC's Geneva headquarters, shows little resemblance to the one that shut its doors at the end of June 2011.      The 20-million franc ($21-million) renovation added 600 square metres to the permanent exhibition space and a brand-new temporary exhibition space stretching across 500 square metres that will open next year.      While the previous permanent exhibit, in place since the museum first opened in 1988, guided visitors through a traditional chronology of the history of humanitarian action, the new exhibit, dubbed ""The Humanitarian Adventure"", is thematic and almost fully interactive.      ""In the age of the internet and instantaneous information, we asked ourselves what can a museum offer that is different from the information you find online"" about the Red Cross and its 150-year history, Mayou said, pointing out that the answer was ""an emotional experience.""      To convey the main idea of resilience, 12 interactive witnesses for instance guide visitors through the exhibit, with their projected images jumping to life when touched and describing their journeys from darkness towards the light.      ""Because of a land mine explosion, I lost my two legs,"" testifies Najmuddin Helal, the head of ICRC's orthopaedic centre in Kabul, steadying himself with a cane.      After five years of despair he received help and physical rehabilitation and decided to put his own experience to good use, he says: ""I know what it means to lose a limb . . . I can give the dignity that I have regained to others as well.""      The witnesses, who also include a former child soldier from Sudan, a dentist who helped identify victims after Japan's 2011 tsunami, and former international war crimes prosecutor Carla del Ponte, punctuate each of the exhibit's three sections, covering the themes, ""Defending Human Dignity,"" ""Restoring Family Links"" and ""Reducing Natural Risks.""      The sections are each presented through the distinct designs of three internationally renowned architects.      To enter the ""Family Links"" section, Burkina Faso architect Diebedo Francis Kere for instance forces visitors to pass through a dark corridor obstructed by a thick curtain of chains, thrusting them ""into the heart of family tragedies which begin during conflict situations,"" the museum said.      Once visitors have wrestled past the last cold metal chain, they enter aisle upon aisle of glassed-in floor-to-ceiling cabinets containing millions of yellowed index cards documenting the fates of civilians and prisoners of war during the First World War, before coming face to face with a towering hempcrete wall covered with photographs of Rwandan children used to help reunite them with their families following the 1994 genocide.    The ""Natural Risks"" section, sculpted with waves of cardboard tubes by Japanese architect Shigeru Ban, meanwhile gives visitors a chance to test their disaster preparedness skills with an interactive game requiring players to plant mangroves, build shelters, reserve stocks of food and organise evacuations in the aim of saving the most possible lives when the hurricane hits.      And in the ""Human Dignity"" section, created by Brazilian Gringo Cardia, a plaster sculpture of Red Cross founder Henry Dunant sitting at a desk with the founding ideas of the organisation moving beneath his feet is followed by a massive plaster foot symbolically trampling on a large screen filled with images of war, destruction and humiliation.      That section ends on a more hopeful note, though, with a high-tech interactive wall covered in strings of different coloured light, that change colour and direction when touched.      ""That is what humanitarian actions are: not to be happy with a given situation but to do something to change it,"" Mayou explained.
 The museum reopening coincides with the 150th anniversary of the start of the Red Cross. "
