“The cynicism among politicians, both in Norway and the rest of Europe, when it comes to refugees has reached a level we have not seen before. They should be ashamed,” Dimitris Christopoulos said.
Christopoulos was one of the featured speakers at a demonstration organized in protest against the government's asylum and immigration policies.
“It has taken a century and two World Wars to establish human rights. Now they are threatened,” he said to the crowd of nearly 4,000 torch bearers who had formed a sea of light in front of parliament.
“In Europe, with its half a billion inhabitants, a million refugees is called a crisis. But we are not the ones who are in crisis. It is the millions of people who cannot get anywhere. This is shameful,” he said.
On Thursday, Christopoulos, who also is a professor of political science, will meet with the Norwegian Helsinki Committee, a human rights NGO, and representatives of the Norwegian Foreign Ministry.
He has just one message for Norwegian politicians.
“If you really want to achieve respect and moral credibility as a rich and well-developed society, you cannot shut yourselves in. It is impossible,” he said.
“You need to show solidarity with the weak and those who need to escape. If you do not take responsibility, but instead build walls around the country and send signals that people are not welcome, it will undermine respect in the long term,” he said.
Through a number of restrictions, Norway has brought its asylum numbers down to their lowest point in 19 years."

Norway has offered to take 1,500 asylum seekers over two years as part of the EU’s refugee relocation scheme. The first of those EU asylum seekers are expected to arrive within a month, but Listhaug said on Friday that the Norway would not expand its offer.
“We have set a quota for refugees from the EU. Increasing it is not of current interest,” Listhaug told NTB.
Listhaug said she was open to some of the previously-agreed 1,500 asylum seekers coming from Turkey as part of the EU deal, but stressed that the total sum of 750 this year and 750 the next is not up for negotiation.
“Norway is among the countries that has contributed the most to the relocation programme when measured per capita,” she said.
The EU and Turkey agreed in March to a deal in which the Turks will take migrants and refugees back from the Greek islands in exchange for the EU taking Syrian refugees directly from Turkey.
The first Syrians were flown from Turkey to Europe this week and EU countries have planned for up to 72,000 similar resettlements.
Listhaug was in Denmark on Friday to visit with her Danish counterpart, Inger Støjberg. The two visited a tent camp for asylum seekers in Næstved. Danish parties have pressured Støjberg to copy a proposed Norwegian provision that would allow the denial of all asylum seekers who do not come directly from countries in conflict in emergency situations but Danish press reported on Friday that she had shot down the suggestion."

					14:32 CET+01:00				",The Local,Norway wants to deny all refugees if 'it all breaks down',"In an effort to stem the flow of refugees coming from other Nordic countries and Russia, the Norwegian PM is proposing a law that would allow the nation to prevent asylum-seekers from non-conflict areas entering Norway.
Norwegian Prime Minister Erna Solberg is proposing emergency legislation that would allow Norway to deny entry to all asylum seekers who do not come directly from countries in conflict.
Solberg said that the legislation would only be implemented in an emergency situation and would protect Norway from the deteriorating situation within the Schengen region and the mounting strain the Swedish asylum system is facing from the current refugee crisis in Europe.
Under her plan, asylum seekers entering from Russia or other Nordic countries would be immediately rejected if they are not coming directly from areas of conflict.
The legislation would go against the UN Refugee Convention and has therefore faced strong criticism, but Solberg said it would only be implemented in the face of a complete breakdown of Sweden's asylum system, which took in 163,000 asylum seekers in 2015 and expects an additional 100,000 this year.
""It is a force majeure proposal which we will have in the event that it all breaks down, the influx continues and everyone ends up in Norway because we are at the outer edge of Europe,” Solberg told Danish daily Berlingske.
""Norway is the last stop, isn't it?"" she added.
Even though the PM said her proposal would only be used in emergency situations, it has been slammed by the Norwegian Lawyers' Association as a direct violation of Norway’s international obligations.
""Several of these proposals violate human rights. We see the law as a rushed proposal,"" Bente Mostad Tjugum, the head of the association's asylum and immigration committee, told broadcaster NRK.
Solberg has defended the proposed legislation as a safety net for Norway.
“If the mechanisms in place in Europe do not work, then we have a chance to reject them [asylum seekers, ed.]. It is not a suggestion that we should do such a thing in the future, but it is a legal security measure if other countries fail to live up to their obligations,” Solberg continued.
The legislation will be presented to parliament soon, and is expected to gain broad support as Norway has begun adopting stricter refugee policies. Parties continue to bicker, however, over the government's 40-point asylum plan.
In 2015, around 30,000 people applied for asylum in Norway, a country of 5.2 million."

The Hallingdal district in Buskerud County, for example, has seen the number of asylum centres drop from eight to two over the last year, reports broadcaster NRK.
“It is difficult because a close relationship has been forged here... they have contact with the local community. The only safe thing they have is their bed, and now we are taking the beds from them,” Gry Herland, head of the Hemsedal asylum centre, told NRK.
Planned reduction of asylum facilities in Hemsedal means that 15 underage asylum seekers will have to move once school holidays begin.
The number of people living at the centre in Hemsedal is to be reduced to 130 by the summer – down from a peak of 600 at four different facilities in the town at the height of the refugee flow in 2015, reports NRK.

A secondary aspect of the closures is a loss of jobs.
“Everyone that works here has been given their notice. This is a region that has seasonal work, so it is hard to find a new job during the summer,” said Herland.
In Gol, another town in Buskerud, a state-run asylum centre with 59 residents will close on July 15th.
“Such is life in the asylum area, almost no asylum seekers are coming now,” said Gol centre manager Vita Simon to NRK.
Centres for unaccompanied minors also face an uncertain future, reports NRK.
“It is the Norwegian Directorate of Immigration (UDI) that decides how long they can stay here for,” Tore Fauske Haugen, leader of the state asylum centre at Hol, said.
Staff at the centre must be given three months’ notice of redundancy. While no such notice has yet been received, the number of arrivals is considerably lower than in 2015 and 2016, says Haugen.
“On the 1st January 2016, 32,000 asylum seekers lived at asylum centres in Norway. On 1st January 2017 it was 14,500. Today it is 9,924. If that trend continues it will be fewer still by the end of the year which presumably also means fewer centres,” he said."

Avramopoulos also voiced his approval of stronger control at the EU's outer borders, reports broadcaster NRK.
The UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) recently requested help relocating 40,000 of the quota refuges currently temporarily housed by the UNHCR in Libya and other countries in the region.
The quota system enables the UN to relocate refugees whose needs cannot be met in countries that neighbour the conflicts they have fled from.
This might include refugees needing special protection, torture victims, unaccompanied women or children with rare illnesses.
The UN is currently able to relocate one percent of its registered refugees, although as many as ten percent actually need to be relocated, according to a report last week by Danish newspaper Politiken.
Avramopoulos said that he supports the UNHCR initiative fully, writes NRK.
The commissioner has now sent a letter to all EU and Schengen member countries, including Norway, encouraging the individual states to take positive action.

“I asked them in the letter to be as ambitious as possible, and I asked them in particular to increase their efforts to take in quota refugees from North Africa and the Horn of Africa,” Avramopoulos said according to NRK's report.
The target of the EU is to help refugees in countries such as Libya, Egypt, Niger, Ethiopia and Sudan, through which many migrants travel as they attempt to reach Europe via the Mediterranean Sea.
Avramopoulos stressed the need to take in people from these areas as well as from Syria, calling in his letter for governments to be “as ambitious as possible” in their assessments of how many quota refugees can be relocated to their countries.
The letter from the commissioner was sent to Listhaug on August 25th, reports news agency NTB.
The UN has requested Norway and other countries submit new limits for the numbers they are prepared to accept by September 15th, writes NRK.
Two years ago, the EU ratified an agreement for the relocation of 120,000 refugees.
Only a small fraction of that number is currently living in the various countries, according to the report, with the UN stating that three percent of the agreed number had been rehoused after one year.
Avramopoulos also said that he agreed with the need to strengthen the EU's borders in the wake of a string of terror attacks in cities in member states.
“The commission recognises the new security challenges. That was demonstrated by recent terror attacks in Barcelona and Åbo,” the commissioner told journalists after a meeting with EU foreign ministers, according to NRK's report.
Norway, Denmark, Austria, France and Germany have all have implemented temporary control on their Schengen borders since 2015.
Those countries are now seeking to changes Schengen rules in an effort to enable the controls to be extended.
Avramopoulos said the EU's immigration commission would proposal an update to Schengen later this month, writes NRK.

					08:55 CET+01:00				",The Local,Norway launches 'anti-refugee' Facebook page,"Norway's government has taken its campaign to scare away potential asylum seekers onto Facebook, launching a new page, 'Stricter Asylum regulations in Norway', on Friday.
In its first post on Friday afternoon, the page trumpeted the government's plans to:
slash benefits for asylum seekers by 20 percent;
increase the wait for permanent residency from three to five years;
send people home if situations improve in their home countries;
and work with the Iraqi and Eritrean authorities to send asylum seekers back to those countries.
“It's not exactly ‘Welcome to Norway',” admitted Jøran Kallmyr, a state secretary in the Ministry of Justice appointed by the anti-immigration Progress Party. “We want to provide accurate and sober information.”
The Facebook page follows the launch of the country's negative advertising campaign over Twitter the previous Friday. That was done with a warning message sent out by by Norway's Directorate of Immigration (UDI) informing Afghan citizens crossing the country's northern border with Russia that they risked being returned to Kabul.
#Afghani adults without need for asylum coming the #artic_route from #Russia, risk rejection of their application and being sent to #Kabul.
— UDI (@Utlendingsdir) October 30, 2015
The message has been followed up over last week with similar Tweets in English and in Russian.
Афганцы без нужды в убежище прибывающие #Арктическим путем из #России рискуют высылку в #Кабул. 500 высланы из #Норвегии в 2014/15
— UDI (@Utlendingsdir) November 5, 2015
Kallmyr said the information on the Facebook Page would soon be translated into Pashto and Dari.
The tough social media message comes as around 50 to 60 asylum seekers housed at an asylum centre in Sarpsborg, south of Oslo, launched a protest against the 'deplorable conditions' at the centre.
""We do not get enough food, we are going hungry,"" one of the demonstrators told NRK reporter Marianne Løkkevik Ekeberg on Saturday night.
Mazyar Keshvari, the immigration spokesman for the populist Progress Party, said that these ""ungrateful"" asylum seekers should be repatriated.
He said their complaints made a mockery of those fleeing civil war and oppression across the world.
""In this situation, some of the luckiest people, who have been provided in Norway with food, drink, clothing and shelter at taxpayers' expense, are protesting the quality of the food and the internet speed on reception,"" he said.
""These ungrateful people should immediately get out of the country, freeing capacity for those who need security and protection.""
Norway is not the first country in the region to have attempted to reduce numbers of asylum seekers using negative advertising.
Denmark's foreign ministry in September published advertisements in four Lebanese newspapers warning Syrian refugees that the country had recently halved the level of benefits received by refugees.
The strategy appears to have had some success. Of the 13,000 refugees who passed through Denmark in September, only 1,500 applied for asylum."

Exhausted, the group must quickly pack up camp and resume their night march.
This is not a scene playing in the Balkans but in Norway, one of the richest countries in the world, where a group of teenagers are spending 24 hours on the road, living as refugees.
In a country where teens often walk around with luxury handbags and the latest iPhones, the aim is to raise awareness and give youngsters a bit of insight into the lives of millions of people much less privileged than themselves.
For many, the experience is part of their ""civil confirmation"" -- a secular version of the Christian coming-of-age ceremony which is a rite of passage for 15-year-olds in northern Europe.
""I hate my life,"" groans a young girl in the group, some of whom are still asleep on their feet.
The 'UN camp' where they thought they had found refuge for the night has just been 'attacked'.
In the darkness, with temperatures hovering around zero, they must press on, ignoring their hunger and diving into snowbanks to hide at the first glare of headlights.
Their journey began around 12 hours earlier at a decommissioned military camp near Oslo airport, just a stone's throw from a real detention centre for illegal aliens awaiting deportation.
'It's exhausting'
Their watches and cell phones confiscated, the teens have been grouped into 'families' of 20 who have had to flee unrest in a fictitious Sudan, crossing imaginary borders to reach Norway to seek asylum.
En route, they come up against the red-tape nightmare of a Kafkaesque and corrupt bureaucracy, the bullying of sinister border guards who bark orders at them in poor English, and walk miles on ever-hungry stomachs...
""Netflix in the bath,"" fantasises one 'refugee' aloud. ""Netflix AND a kebab in the bath,"" says another.

For dinner that night, they had only a few rice balls. Most of them devoured their meal, though some were put off by label with an apparent expiry date of 1998.
""The power of a label,"" sighs the 'head' of the 'UN camp', Jonas Statsengen, one of the adult volunteers running the session.
As the hours pass, the teens' good-natured laughter gradually fades and swearing takes over.
""Horribly tough,"" says Ebbe Marienborg Schieldrop, a teenager playing the role of a father in his group.
""It's obviously much worse for real refugees, but the hunger, the fatigue, all of it... It's exhausting.""
'A little extra soul'
Although the role play was not created in response to the ongoing migration crisis which has engulfed Europe over the past year, the sudden proximity of the refugees' plight has given it particular resonance.
Since the concept was imported from Denmark in 2004, some 80,000 Norwegian youngsters have gone through the experience of living life as a refugee for a day.
""They leave with a little extra soul,"" says Lasse Moen Sørensen, deputy head of Refugee Norway, a non profit organisation.
And while it only scratches the surface of a much harsher reality, it helps raise awareness of the refugees' plight.
""We're very lucky,"" acknowledges one of the participants, Birgitte Solli, her eyelids heavy from exhaustion.
""This is learning by doing,"" explains Kenneth Johansen, founder of Refugee Norway.
""If you read about refugees, you'll remember about 20 percent. And if you experience it, you'll remember 80 percent. You will learn it for the rest of your life,"" he says.
Unforgettable experience
""If you see a news segment or read about it, you'll remember the feeling you had at Camp Refugee,"" he says.
The experience ends with a review, with Johansen helping the youngsters put things into perspective, using hard-hitting videos to drive the point home.
""Never forget this night you spent outdoors, crossing borders with your backpacks and all the yelling. That's what 60 million real refugees are living through everyday,"" Johansen tells the groggy teens.
""For you, it was a game. For them, it's hell on Earth everyday."""

Following in the footsteps of Scandinavian neighbour Denmark, Norway has published advertisements in foreign newspapers to discourage refugees and asylum seekers.
The Norwegian government placed ads in Afghanistan newspapers warning that “immigration to Norway is strictly regulated”.
“Persons who do not qualify for a permit in Norway and whose applications are denied must return tot heir country of origin or country habitual residence. If you do not leave voluntarily, you will be returned by force,” the ad, placed by the Norwegian Ministry of Justice and Public Security, reads.
The ads appeared on the front page of the English-language Afghanistan Times and the Dari-language Hasht-e-sub. The ad appeared in the Monday through Thursday editions of both newspapers and will also be published in Friday’s edition of the latter.

— The Local Norway (@TheLocalNorway) November 26, 2015
The ad makes it clear that Afghans are unlikely to achieve refugee status in Norway.
“People from safe areas of Afghanistan or who have been granted residence in another country will have their application rejected and will be deported. People from areas that are not considered safe may be returned to other parts of Afghanistan,” it reads.
The ad then details recent changes to asylum policy, including the cutting of benefits for people in refugee reception centres, the issuing of temporary residence permits and limits on family reunification.
Justice Minister Anders Anundsen told Aftenposten that the ads were meant to combat “misperceptions”.
“It is often a challenge that people base their travel plans upon misperceptions of a country’s asylum policies. There are many people who believe, for example, that they can travel to Norway and create a new life,” he said.
In addition to the newspaper ads, the Norwegian government also launched a Facebook page earlier this month to convey the country’s “stricter asylum regulations”.
The new campaign is similar to one published by the Danish government in Lebanese newspapers. Those ads received extensive international attention and led to not one but two counter ads from pro-refugee groups.
Germany also recently launched a campaign in Afghanistan to tell its nationals to think carefully before embarking on the tough journey to seek asylum in Europe,"

Norway’s Storskog border crossing has been relatively quiet since the Nordic nation announced that it would begin immediately rejecting asylum seekers who had been legally residing in Russia. But the slowdown may just be the calm before the storm, according to an internal memo from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The memo, which was obtained by VG, warns that a “a perfect political storm” is likely to hit Europe within the next six months, bringing with it increased activity at Norway’s Arctic border.
“The dynamics of the continent and the closure of the Balkan routes can quickly result in increased pressure on Storskog or Finland and the Baltics in the coming months,” the confidential memo said.
It goes on to warn that Norwegians may not be fully prepared for the consequences of further breakdowns in European cooperation.
“The Norwegian psyche is likely not mentally prepared for the full gravity of the migration crisis. That also applies to its costs and impacts on other budget and policy areas. It may be difficult to avoid higher unemployment and increased social welfare costs in 2017,” the memo stated.
VG reported that the memo paints a dire picture of the current state of affairs in Europe, referencing “political polarization and a strengthening of extreme forces” as well as “splits between north and south and east and west in the EU [and] nationalistic and anti-EU policies in the government offices of key countries in Eastern Europe”.
The memo also warns that new terror attacks are likely and that the refugee crisis has hit the point where “the limit for what residents and authorities in European countries can absorb is either already reached or imminent”. Germany and Sweden, the two countries that have accepted the most refugees, are “about to hit the wall”, the memo said.
Foreign Minister Børge Brende declined to comment on the contents of the memo, and a ministry official told VG that it was “an internal working document that has neither been reviewed or approved”.
The memo comes to light as the Norwegian parliament begins renewed discussions on a comprehensive asylum and immigration package."

In October, Immigration Minister Sylvi Listhaug said that the Norwegian government had concluded that the situation in Somalia has settled down and that 1,600 Somali refugees living in Norway should have their refugee status revoked.
In a letter dated November 7th, but first reported on Wednesday night, the UNHCR wrote to the Norwegian government and said that the security situation in Mogadishu was far too unstable to warrant Norway’s decision. Just two days before the letter was sent, a car bomb attack near the Somali parliament building in Mogadishu killed at least two police officers, with some reports indicating that up to 20 people were killed.
The agency encouraged the Nordic nation to not take refugee status from Somali citizens, Dagbladet wrote.
Unaccompanied minor and families with small children were among the first 120 Somalians to have receive notification of their repatriation.
Norwegian authorities believe the situation in Mogadishu is safe and that the practise of sending people back is in line with the UN Refugee Convention. The UNHCR, however, said there is continued violence and conflict in the Somali capital, causing high levels of insecurity.
The UNHCR’s letter pointed out that there is a difference between those who choose to go back voluntarily and sending people back by force."

“This is a signal from Norway,” Labour party leader Jonas Gahr Støre said as he presented the agreement in Norway’s parliament on Wednesday afternoon. “If other countries in our situation reach similar agreements, the United Nations will have come a long way towards reaching its goal.”
The country now plans to welcome 2,000 Syrians this year, that is 500 more than previously planned, followed by 3,000 each year in 2016 and 2017.
The new figures aim to meet a quota set by the UN refugee agency UNHCR.
A compromise came after long discussions between the right-wing minority government, which had opposed allowing in any more refugees, and centre and left-wing parties, which wanted to accept 10,000 people in two years.
Under the agreement, financial aid will be distributed to the country’s regions to encourage them to give shelter to those fleeing Syria’s four-year war.
“I think this agreement was good,” Prime Minister Erna Solberg, from the Conservative party, said. “The proposal of the Conservatives and the government was something else, but given that we were facing a parliamentary majority, we could have ended up agreeing a much higher number.”
Per Sandberg, the deputy leader of the Progress Party and its staunchest anti-immigration voice, claimed on Wednesday evening that “caveats” in the agreement meant it could only result in as few as 800 additional refugees from Syria next year and none this year, a fraction of the headline figure.
“This is therefore a gigantic belly flop for Labour,” he said.
However refugee groups welcomed the move.
“This is an important step in the right direction,” the Norwegian Refugee Council aid agency said in response to the announcement. “NRC now urges other European countries to follow. With some exceptions, like Germany, the European countries have done far too little in response to the largest humanitarian crisis in our generation,” it added.
The UNHCR has called on the international community to resettle more people fleeing Syria’s civil war, which it says has triggered the largest humanitarian crisis since World War II.
Nearly four million Syrians are registered with the UN as having fled into neighbouring countries since the conflict broke out in 2011."

The Norwegian Directorate of Immigration sent out a message over Twitter on Monday morning warning Afghans crossing the country’s northern border with Russia that they risked forced repatriation to Kabul.
#Afghani adults without need for #asylum coming the #arctic_route from #Russia, risk rejection of their application and being sent to Kabul.

Jøran Kallmyr, a state secretary in the Ministry of Justice who was appointed by the anti-immigration Progress Party, said the country also planned a series of newspaper adverts in Russia and other countries.
“The aim is to get the number down. Many are coming and many of them are not from Syria,” Kallmyr told state broadcaster NRK on Sunday. “The refugees choose where they travel, based on what they know about the country. Although Denmark is a safe country, there are relatively few who have sought asylum there.”
Kallmyr said the campaign would, among other things, inform potential asylum seekers of the Norwegian government's proposals to cut the benefits they will receive on arrival.
“It is better that they discover it in advance than that they are disappointed,” he argued.
Denmark’s foreign ministry in September published advertisements in four Lebanese newspapers warning Syrian refugees that the country had recently halved the level of benefits received by refugees.
The strategy appears to have had some success. Of the 13,000 refugees who passed through Denmark in September, only 1,500 applied for asylum.
Kallmyr said that Norway doesn't intend to spend too much money on the newspaper campaigns, relying instead on Facebook and Twitter.
“The main thing now is to use social media. It is cheap and reaches many people,” he said.
In Sweden, the anti-immigration Sweden Democrats this month announced plans to place their own adverts in international papers to deter asylum seekers.
""We want, through advertisements in foreign newspapers, to explain that the utopia they want to come to in Sweden no longer exists. Here, it's tent camps, winter and cold,"" party leader Jimmie Åkesson said at a press conference."

The group included both adults and children and would have been fully paid for by the refugee services.
One of the coordinators from Skjåk municipality seeking to arrange the trip, Magrethe Øvrelid, told the newspaper Gudbrandsdølen Dagningen that it was an unfortunate decision.
“I have no other comment besides that it is unfortunate and that Nissegården's response speaks for itself. We have never experienced anything like this. We are usually only met with goodwill,” she told the newspaper.
In order to be sure that she had not misunderstood the centre's reply, Øvrelid sent an email to Nissegården after speaking with them, but the response was the same.
“If the municipality was spending money on its own people, it would be a completely different matter,” the centre wrote in their email to Øvrelid.
Grethe Madsen, who runs the centre together with her husband Kjell, confirmed to the newspaper that she does not wish to accept visits from refugees to the centre.
“We have the right to take a stand on this. I think they should respect that. This is how we regard the situation, and we do live in a democracy, after all,” she said.

In a comment to VG, Madsen insisted that she was not a racist, but feels that the municipality is engaging in differential treatment for asylum seekers compared to children in the local area, and that that is one of the reasons she said no.
The Norwegian Equality and Anti-Discrimination Ombud, Hanne Bjurstrøm, told Gudbrandsdølen Dagningen that refusing sale of goods and services based on reasons tied to ethnicity or national origin may be against the law, and that the case as it has been presented in the media appears serious.
“As a general rule, denial of goods and services due to ethnicity or national origin is punishable under paragraph 186 of the Norwegian Penal Code. We recommend that those who encounter such situations either report it to the police or contact us,” Bjurstrøm said."

“Norway should not take on tasks that we can not handle. That’s why Progress is saying ‘no’ to accepting 10,000 quota refugees and ‘yes’ to increasing aid to neighbouring countries,” Siv Jensen said to strong applause at the party’s annual conference on Sunday.
Labour party leader Jonas Gahr Støre announced at his party’s annual conference, that his party planned to campaign in the parliament for Norway to agree to take 5,000 Syrian refugees this year and another 5,000 in 2016.
Labour already has the backing of the Left Party, and hopes that the Christian Democrats will also back the proposal at its conference this coming weekend.
Jensen, who also serves as finance minister in the country’s coalition government, cited figures showing that settling just 1,000 new Syrian refugees in Norway would cost a prohibitive one billion kroner ($130m).
“That means that instead of settling a refugee in Norway, we can help 14 refugees in camps,” she said.
Christian Tybring-Gjedde, one of the party's most outspoken figures on immigration, criticised Jensen for not going further in her speech, showing the strength of feeling within the party’s grass roots.
“We want to have zero,” he said. “We don’t want to have 9999, we don’t want two. We want to have zero. We shouldn’t accept Støre’s premise, and sit in a room and say, ‘we will not accept your 10,000’ but agree on 6000’,” he warned.
On Tuesday, parliamentarians from all Norway’s major party’s will hold a meeting initiated by parliamentary leader of Conservative party where they will discuss who many refugees Norway should accept, initiated by Trond Helleland, the parliamentary leader of Conservative party.
Next week, when Norway’s government announces amendments to its 2015 budget, Labour and other parties will be keen to see whether any allowances have been made for accepting increasing numbers of refugees."

The Humanitarian Leadership Academy aims to set up 10 centres to train 100,000 aid workers, health professionals and volunteers from 50 countries, particularly in areas prone to disaster and conflict.
The project could ""revolutionise the entire humanitarian sector"", according to Jan Egeland, head of the Norwegian Refugee Council and chair of the Humanitarian Leadership Academy's board.
""Investment in a new and better trained generation of humanitarian workers closer to where we find the greatest needs will bring development and sustainability to many of the world's most fragile communities,"" Egeland said.
More aid workers are needed to deal with what Save the Children described as an ""unprecedented number of crisis"", including 50 million people who have been forced to flee their countries, the largest number of refugees since World War II.
Trained locals would be able to respond faster in the crucial first days after a disaster, according to Gareth Owen, humanitarian director of Save the Children UK.
""The usual way to respond is to mobilise our civil service of responders, usually from the West,"" Owen said. ""We have to get more frontline leadership out there in a local setting and support that in a better way with the wisdom we've accrued as international respondents,"" he said.
""Ultimately it's about having the right people in the right place at the right time. Decisions made early on by people who are on the ground matter hugely.""
The effort has received £20 million ($30 million, 27 million euros) in funding from Britain's Department for International Development, out of £50 million it needs for its first five years.
Norway has contributed £500,000, while charity Save the Children has paid for the start-up costs and is hosting the academy. The first training centres are to open in Kenya and the Philippines later this year.
Training will be available in a range of languages and the academy will spread best practice globally, according to Save the Children.
Aid agencies such as Oxfam and Action Against Hunger and academic bodies like the Open University and HCRI Manchester University are also collaborating on the project."

“There is no reason to believe that this will stop,” Hans Møllebakken, chief of police in the town of Kirkenes, deep within the Arctic Circle, told Norway's VG newspaper. “The fact is, if you have money, you can get from Damascus to Storskog in under 48 hours: This is the fast track to Schengen.”
Norwegian and French press spent much of Wednesday camped out at the Storskog border crossing, waiting to intercept a Syrian refugee, after a report last week in the local Sør-Varanger Avis on the new route sparked coverage across the world.
As Russian border regulations forbid anyone from crossing over by foot, and those driving refugees risk being charged with people smuggling, many travel by bike.
At 5pm on Wednesday, the first Syrian, a 20-year-old man came tottering over the border on brand-new bicycle, where, to his slight confusion, they were met by a small crowd of Norwegian and French journalists.
“I'm from Syria and spent a week getting myself up here,” the man told NRK before he was escorted away by border officials.
The man said he had travelled overland via Turkey and Russia.
After him came another, much older man, and then a family of six, including three children.
Just since Friday, a further 21 asylum seekers have arrived at Norway's Storskog border, more than used the crossing in the whole of 2014.
So far this year more than 160 refugees have crossed the border, most of them on bicycles.
“We have neither the manpower or facilities to handle a further increase in traffic,” Møllebakken warned NRK.
He told VG that most of the bicycles seemed to have been bought solely for the purposes of making the crossing.
“Most of the bikes are brand new, some of them still have plastic hanging on the screws,” he said.
There are no facilities at the border post, and refugees have to wait on a small sofa for police to arrive and take them Kirkenes, from where they are put on the first available flight to Oslo."

The Norwegian government is opening a new reception centre in Oslo as Tøyen can no longer deal with the number of refugees.
""We have known that the the Police Immigration Service reception centre at Tøyen is not working for a long time, and we have been working to find a new place to register newly arrived asylum seekers,"" Jørgen Kallmyr of the Ministry of Justice and Public Security told NRK.
Lindboe says that the problems run deeper than just a swift registration process.

“The international community must be ready to strengthen its efforts,” said Jan Egeland, secretary general of the Norwegian Refugees Council. The war in Syria is currently the biggest source of refugees, although conflicts in Africa are also a significant factor. South Sudan could be heading for a catastrophic civil war and the Central African Republic continues to be one of the world’s most under-reported war zones, according to the charity. This could make 2014 a year during which an even greater number of people are forced to flee their homes than 1994, when more than 47 million people worldwide were refugees due to the Rwandan genocide and the Bosnian War. “The most recent developments in South Sudan are tragic but unsurprising. The world must prepare for a civil war that will cause many people to flee, as there is no quick solution,” Egeland, a former deputy secretary general of the UN, said. The Sahel area of sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East, Afghanistan and Pakistan were all areas where there were few indications of peace any time soon.
In Syria, more than 2.3 million people have fled to neighbouring countries, a figure that is expected to rise to 4.1 million by the end of 2014. An additional 6.5 million people have had to flee their homes to other parts of Syria. “For Norway this means that we, like other European countries, must accept more refugees. At the same time the main efforts should be focused on helping even more refugees in the near-neighbourhood. Not least, Norway must give more aid to countries sheltering a rapidly rising number of Syrian refugees, like Iraq, Lebanon and Jordan,” Egeland said."

Norway is already the seventh biggest donor to the Syrian crisis in absolute numbers, and the second per capita behind Kuwait, she said.
Solberg countered the opposition's demand to welcome 10,000 Syrian refugees over the next two years, arguing that aid was more effective when it was distributed locally and that the country was already struggling to find housing for existing refugees.
In 2015, the wealthy Scandinavian country plans to take in 1,500 Syrian refugees as part of the UN's High Commissioner for Refugees annual quotas.
""The cost of settling in 1,000 refugees is estimated at one billion kroner over five years,"" Solberg said. ""That means that instead of taking in one refugee in Norway, we can help 14 who are living in camps or 27 who do not live in camps in the region.""
According to the Norwegian government, some 5,000 people who have been granted residency permits remain in refugee centres in Norway due to a lack of housing.

To finance the extra cost, the right-wing government -- which includes the populist, anti-immigration Progress Party -- proposed to withdraw 1.2 billion kroner from its public pension fund, which is the world's largest sovereign wealth fund.

The government also plans to redirect 4.2 billion kroner from its international development budget to help cover the refugee costs.
Redirecting funds like that is allowed under OECD rules but is criticised by non-governmental organisations, which fear it will only lead to an increase in migrants fleeing conflicts and hardship.
The remaining 4.1 billion are to be financed by postponing some tax cuts and with other savings, such as slashing refugees' benefits by 20 percent, reducing their Norwegian language class hours and speeding up the deportation of rejected asylum seekers.

Christian Tybring-Gjedde, one of the most outspoken anti-immigration figures in Norwegian politics, issued his threat on Monday in an article published in the left-wing Klasskampen newspaper. “If they submit a no-confidence motion against the Justice Minister it will automatically cause the whole government to collapse,” he warned. “If the Liberals keep harassing him in this way, there will not be a government sitting for much longer.” Anundsen has been fighting for his political survival after an investigation by Bergens Tidende newspaper revealed in December that his ministry had never instructed Norway’s immigration police to soften the country’s policy towards children seeking asylum, making it look as if the ruling two-party coalition had reneged on the post-election deal it struck with the minority Christian Democrat and Liberal Parties. The failure has enraged party activists for whom the government’s agreement to bring in a more lenient policy towards refugee children was one of the few achievements won in the difficult coalition discussions after the country's 2013 election. Over the weekend, grassroots meetings of both parties called on their parties leaders to submit a no-confidence motion in Anundsen. “We are sending a very strong message to the leader of the Liberal Party in parliament that we have very little faith in Amundsen,” Anja Berggård Endresen, from the Liberal Party in Rogaland told The Local. “This is something that lots of people in the Liberal Party feel very strongly about as these children have been an issue for us for a long time, but I don’t know if this will persuade our politicians to make him go.” In a parliamentary hearing on Friday, Anundsen put the blame for the failure to enact the policy onto the Police Directorate and Police Immigration Service, claiming that he had given instructions that the policy should be put into place. “I believe we have done what we could to ensure a policy change,” he told parliament. “But I admit it is difficult to ascertain that policy change has actually happened when looking at the numbers. I was surprised when I saw the number of children sent out.” Endresen told The Local that Liberal Party activists suspected that the failure to implement the policy was deliberate as it conflicted with Progress Party’s programme of reducing immigration. “We think it’s not proper behaviour to push the blame further down in his organisation,” she said. “It’s his responsibility and he should have seen this through.” The leadership of the Liberal and Christian Democrat parties have yet to give a clear signal on how they will respond following Anundsen’s hearing on Friday. “I understand and respect the county teams’ concernS, but we must consider the answers that were given to the Parliamentary Control Committee before we decide the way forward,” Abid Raja, the Liberal Party’s representative for Akerhus, told NTB on Monday."

					22:30 CEST+02:00				",The Local,'Difficult for Sweden to register refugees' ,"Norway on Friday pulled back from criticising Sweden after the country's migration authorities admitted that they could not force refugees to register if they wanted to move onwards to Norway.
“Many EU countries are now experiencing the challenge that people evade detection, and it is difficult for the authorities to have an overview of all the refugees who have arrived,” Jøran Kallmyr, a Secretary of State in the Ministry of Justice, said on Friday evening, after Finland's Interior Minister criticised Sweden for doing too little to prevent refugee coming through.
“Through my contact with Sweden, they confirm that they are prepared to comply with the Schengen commitments and their obligations under international law,” he added.
Norway's newspapers on Friday argued that Sweden was following Denmark's example and no longer forcing refugees to register in the country if they wanted to move on to Finland or Norway.
“It is important to emphasise that we do not force anyone to give up fingerprints or seek asylum in Sweden,” Rexhep Hajirizi, an emergency coordinator with the Swedish Migration Agency in Malmö, was quoted as saying by the NTB newswire.
Finland's interior minister Petteri Orpo on Thursday night criticised Sweden because its national train company SJ had allowed refugees to travel by train through into Finland without checking documents.
“It cannot be that Sweden, as an EU member, a Schengen country and a Dublin country, is such that its oversight of foreigners dies not work in the way that it has agreed it should,” Orpo said.
Kallemyr was very clear that Norway expected Sweden to continue upholding the Dublin rules.
“Under the Dublin system, it is envisaged that asylum seekers should not be sent from one country to another, and it is not up to the asylum seekers to decide which Schengen country they want to seek asylum in,” he said.
Norway's Justice Minister Anders Amundsen will travel to Brussels on Monday for an emergency meeting on the refugee crisis.
Prime Minister Erna Solberg warned in a debate on Friday that the government should have “ice in its stomach” during the negotiations on how to distribute the 160,000 refugees the European Commission believe will need to be settled across the union this year.
“I do not think that it is prudent for the Norwegian asylum system and Norwegian municipalities to say that no matter how many people are coming to Norway, we'll take a little bit more,” she said. “Now we need some ice in the stomach.”
She said Norway was receiving near record numbers of asylum seekers, with some 700 coming to Norway last week.
“Norway is a generous country. We are contributing a great national effort,” she said.
Norwegian volunteer groups are following the example of Swedes and Danes who have helped refugees travel across borders without registering with the authorities, something police warned was a criminal offence.
“To carry people across the border without valid travel documents is considered human smuggling,” police lawyer John Skarpeid said on Friday after four Norwegians were charged for human trafficking on Thursday."

Total asylum applications received by the country dropped from 30,000 in 2015 to 3,500 in 2017, and were particularly low towards the end of the year, according to figures from the Norwegian Directorate of Immigration (Utlendingsdirektoratet, UDI).
The majority of individuals that applied for asylum in Norway last year came to the country from Italy or Greece, according to the agency.
The asylum seekers were of different nationalities, but migration from Turkey clearly increased, the UDI reports.
Several accommodation facilities for asylum seekers have been closed in Norway over the last 12 months due to the reduction in migration.
The total number of facilities was reduced from 150 to 50, and the number of residents at them fell from 13,400 to 5,100, according to UDI figures.
Contracts with many of the remaining asylum accommodation centres have been cancelled by UDI, with 27 expected to remain by the end of 2018, reports NRK.
Norway is not the only Nordic country to have seen its number of asylum seekers drop. Denmark announced this week that its figures for asylum applications were at a 10-year low.
Countries in southern Europe saw migration continue to increase in 2017, reports NRK.
UDI director Frode Forfang told NRK that, although many European countries still have high number of asylum seekers, the situation in Norway is unlikely to change this year. UDI has estimated around 3,000 as the figure for 2018 arrivals, although that depends on how the situation elsewhere in Europe develops.
4,700 family members were granted reunification with refugees in Norway in 2017. Of these, just over half were from Syria, according to UDI’s figures.
UDI processed over 7,000 applications for asylum last year. Around sixty percent resulted in residency being granted, writes NRK.

According to the newspaper sources, Netanyahu asked Soreide to ""stop funding NGOs that attack Zionism and the State of Israel."" He also said that ""having one country take on another country in such a manner is just unacceptable.""
Soreide reportedly retorted that Norway was not supporting anti-Israeli activity but humanitarian relief.
Frode Andersen, a press spokesman for the Norwegian Foreign Ministry, said Norway would give no official comment on the reports.

Tuva Raanes Bogsnes, a press spokesperson for the Norwegian Refugee Council, similarly told The Local it was impossible to comment without knowing for certain what was said in the meeting.
The Norwegian Refugee Council is one of the most respected refugee aid organisations in the world. It is headed by Jan Egeland, a former state secretary in the Norwegian foreign ministry.
But according to a string of recent articles by Israel Hayom, the organisation has been behind a slew of petitions to Israel's High Court of Justice designed to cause a breakdown in the Israeli justice system.
The newspaper cited an unnamed lawyer connected to NRC as saying that the plan was to ""try every possible legal measure to disrupt the Israeli judicial system. … As many cases as possible are registered and as many cases as possible are appealed to increase the workload of the courts and the High Court to such an extent that there will be a block"".

In a matter of just five months, Norwegians appear to have largely reversed their outlook on accepting refugees. In a poll conducted by Ipsos MMI and published on Saturday, 42 percent of respondents said that Norway should accept fewer refugees, 25 percent said the numbers shouldn't raise from the current level and 28 percent thought the Nordic country should take in more refugees.
A similar poll carried out in June showed nearly the opposite, with 42 percent advocating for more refugees and 31 percent saying there should be fewer let in to Norway.
PM Erna Solberg told Dagbladet that she is in agreement with the Norwegians that there are too many refugees currently seeking out the country.
“It is important that we try to limit the number of groundless asylum applications. It is in the best interests of Norwegian society, the ability to successfully integrate and for those people who have a genuine need for protection,” she said.
The opinion poll comes after Norway's parliament on Thursday agreed to asylum reforms that the deputy leader of the anti-immigration Progress Party hailed as “the strictest” in Europe, along with Denmark.

Under the deal, the government will reduce asylum seekers' social benefits, putting them on a par with levels in neighbouring Nordic countries to make Norway less attractive, and speed up the processing of some cases and the expulsion of rejected asylum seekers.
It will also limit access to permanent residency, and make it harder to qualify for family reunifications.
Norway, a member of the Schengen area of free movement even though it is not a member of the European Union, has also increasingly used media channels to discourage new arrivals, in particular the growing number of migrants arriving via the Arctic route across northern Russia.

Solberg said she has consistently pushed for policies that will result in fewer asylum seekers.
“I haven't been in a competition on who can take in the most refugees. I have been very clear that invitational signals would be a challenge for Norway as a nation and therefore I have been very reserved,” she told Dagbladet.

Mohammed al-Otaibi, 49, fled to neighbouring Qatar in March after he faced charges in Saudi Arabia related to his human rights work and was referred to an anti-terrorism court, the Gulf Center for Human Rights said in a statement.
Otaibi was ""forcibly deported to Saudi Arabia"" at dawn Sunday while on his way to Norway, said the Gulf Center, which has offices in Copenhagen and Beirut.
""It's regrettable that Qatar chose to deport that person to Saudi Arabia,"" Norwegian foreign ministry spokeswoman Ane Haavardsdatter Lunde told AFP in an email statement late Monday.
""We are concerned by the situation and we will continue to monitor the developments for this person through a dialogue with relevant organisations and countries,"" she added.
Andreas Skjold-Lorange, a spokesman for the Norwegian justice ministry, confirmed ""that a Saudi human rights activist who had received a travel permit to Norway as a (UN) quota refugee has been sent from Qatar to Saudi Arabia"".
He and his wife -- who was not deported to Saudi Arabia -- were not seeking asylum in Norway but have been processed as United Nations refugees, the ministry said.
Qatari authorities also confirmed the deportation, but said it had taken place on ""Wednesday May 24"".
The official Qatar News Agency (QNA) said that the deportation had been confirmed by a foreign ministry source.
""The extradition was... based on legal procedures and regional and international agreements relating to the extradition of accused persons and criminals,"" the agency said.
First arrested in 2009, Otaibi in 2013 co-founded the Union for Human Rights in Riyadh.
Authorities ordered it shut after about one month, but he continued his work, issuing reports and giving television interviews, the Gulf Center said.
New York-based Human Rights Watch warned in April that Otaibi would be at risk of a long prison sentence and possible ill-treatment if forcibly returned to Saudi Arabia.
On a visit to the kingdom early this month, a United Nations special rapporteur, Ben Emmerson, strongly condemned Saudi Arabia for using counter-terrorism legislation and penal sanctions ""against individuals peacefully exercising their rights to freedom of expression"", religion, or association.
Saudi Arabia says that human rights are a matter of definition and ""values"" from one country should not be imposed.
It says the kingdom has made great strides in rights to education, healthcare and other areas.

Last week, 899 of the new arrivals came from Afghanistan, with people from the central Asian country outnumbering those fleeing the ongoing civil war in Syria for the second week running.

But so far, Norway's government is not considering such measures.

In an executive order signed on Friday, Trump suspended the US refugee resettlement programme for 120 days and put an indefinite stop to the acceptance of Syrian refugees.
He also barred citizens from the Muslim-majority countries Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Syria, Sudan and Yemen from entering the United States for 90 days.
Trump's immigration moves sparked anger, confusion and protests in airports around the world. A passenger aboard a Norwegian flight from Oslo to Los Angeles was denied entry upon arrival, the airline confirmed.
The entry ban also applies to dual citizens of any of the seven countries on Trump's blacklist. The affect on Norway is expected to be limited, as Norwegian immigration law only allows for dual citizenship in certain limited circumstances.
The Norwegian government said that it has made its views on Trump's new policies known to Washington and that it would seek further clarification on how the ban might affect Norwegians."

The government confirmed in a statement that a Norwegian ship staffed with civilian workers as well as justice and defence personnel was expected to be in place in the Mediterranean around August 1st.
Norway has never before committed to joining rescue teams in the Mediterranean, but Prime Minister Erna Solberg said in a statement that the country would also consider contributing to an expanded European Union rescue mission.
The European Union will hold an emergency summit this Thursday after some 700 migrants died when their boat capsized off Libya.
The Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) last week increased its pressure on the country's government to commit to sending a vessel, after 400 refugees were killed when their ship capsized off the Libyan coast.
“We should initially send a rescue vessel. We know that with one ship alone we can save several thousand people,” Tuva Raanes Bogsnes, the NRC's communications director, told TV2 before Monday's announcement. “How many people have to die before the government decides to send a ship? It is urgent. Norway is a coastal nation, and we know about sea rescue.”
This weekend, a further 700 migrants were feared drowned after their packed boat capsized off Libya in what may be the deadliest such disaster to date in the Mediterranean, prompting Pope Francis to make a fresh appeal to European Union leaders to act to stem the loss of life off Italy's southern shores.
""They are men and women like us,"" he said in his weekly address to the Roman Catholic faithful in St Peter's square.
Last year alone, an estimated 3,000 people drowned while trying to cross the Mediterranean into Europe, with the number expected to be even higher this tear, as refugees from civil wars in Syria and Yemen attempt the treacherous journey on overcrowded and unseaworthy vessels.
Italy vowed to increase its rescue capabilities after the 2013 Lampedusa tragedy in 2013, when 368 refugees died.
The country's Mare Nostrum operation was launched to tackle human trafficking and the humanitarian emergency at sea.
The well-funded mission brought 330 people smugglers to justice, and rescued 150,810 migrants.
But it was brought to an end in August 2014, due to the high cost and fears that it created a “pull factor” encouraging refugees to attempt the crossing.
According to UNHCR, the death rate among refugees on the Mediterranean has increased 50-fold since the operation was wound up.
The Italian operation has now been replaced by a much smaller European rescue mission, Frontex Plus.
Bognsnes claims that the Italians are calling for other European states to come to their aid in rescuing migrants.
“The Italians have been clear: they cannot handle this situation alone. They are asking for a larger European commitment, and we are saying that Europe should assist, and that includes Norway,” she told TV2"

Norwegian refugee business Hero Norge began running sex classes for new refugees after a series of assaults carried out by residents of one of their reception centres.
Now the anti-immigration Danish People’s Party (DF), backed by the Social Democrats and the Social Liberals (Radikale), wants to include sex education as part of Danish language course, aiming to combat what it claims is a disproportionate number of rapes carried out by immigrants and their children.
“If they’ve done something in Norway that works, we should just copy it,” Danish People’s Party spokesman Peter Skaarup told Metroxpress.
Along with DF, the Social Democrats, the Social Liberals and the Conservatives support introducing sex education as part of Danish language courses.
Linda Hagen, who runs 34 asylum centres for Hero Norge, told The Local that the programme had been introduced after a string of sexual offences committed by refugees near one of its centres.
“We had some problems in Stavanger because some of the refugees had sexually violent episodes with Norwegian girls in the centre of the town,” she said. “So the police, the immigration department and Hero Norge launched a project to teach refugees about Norwegian behaviour.”
Hagen explained that men from sexually conservative countries often struggled to understand how to interpret the behaviour of young Norwegian women.
“It’s difficult if you come from a country where women never go out,” she said. “When you see a girl with a short skirt dancing at a party late in the evening, what kind of message will it give you?
""It’s important to tell them that this kind of behaviour or clothing doesn’t mean that your'e allowed to go the whole way. If a girl says ‘no’, it’s a ‘no’.”
Since Hero Norge began the courses, they have been taken over by the Norwegian charity Alternative to Violence, which gives counselling to men who are violent towards women.
Asylum centre residents are given a voluntary five-hour course aimed at preventing sexual assaults.
Between 2013 and 2014, 34.5 percent of all individuals convicted of rape in Denmark were immigrants or their descendants despite those groups only accounting for roughly 12 percent of Denmark’s total population."

Norway has seen a sharp increase in the number of refugees entering the country, with 2,800 asylum applications filed so far this month, and 20,000 people expected to arrive this year.
NIPH maintains that the refugees do not pose a threat to Norwegian public, because, even though many have had a tough time on their journey to Norway, they are statistically not sicker than the majority of Norwegians.
""There are no special precautions needed. The refugees do not carry any diseases that we don't have in our flora already,"" Arnesen told NRK.

Although refugees do not pose a health threat in Norway, there are serious health problems among the estiamted two million Syrian refugees living in Turkey.
Many Syrian children have not been vaccinated against the measles due to the break down of the health care system in Syria during the ongoing civil war.
This has caused an increase in the number of cases of measles and other illnesses in Turkey, where children living in refugee camps are now being immunised.

John Skarpeid of the Østfold Police, which is responsible for Norway's busiest border with Sweden, said that many migrants were abandoned by those they had paid to get them to Norway while they were still in Sweden, leaving their relatives to manage the final stage of their journey.
""All asylum seekers get help during their journey. Everyone says that they have been forced to pay traffickers on their journey,"" he told the broadcaster. ""Very often, we see that they have been left in Sweden and have to manage the last leg of their journey on their own.""
Helping refugees cross the border is illegal in Norway, even if no money changes hands, leaving the relatives at risk of prison sentences.
""The maximum penalty is three years. But in practice you receive 60 days in jail if you help a relative,"" Skarpeid said.
Six out of ten reported cases of smuggling take place in Østfold along the Swedish-Norwegian border.
So far this year police have uncovered 38 cases of people smuggling, a sharp increase compared to last year. In 2014, police reported just 13 cases between January and September.
The Norwegian organisation for asylum seekers (Noas) is highly critical of the practice of charging relatives with trafficking migrants.
""Is this what we really want? Do we want to punish family members for helping their loved ones to live in the same country when we know what the situation is like in Syria?"" argued Jon Ole Martinsen, Noas' press spokesman.
The Norwegian police say that they are more concerned about cases where smugglers are making money off migrants.
""Law makers have decided on a law that says it's a crime to help people who do not have valid travel documents. We want to apprehend the professional smugglers who make money, and punish them harshly. But when we are talking about people who help relatives, so there is little value in punishing them,"" Skarpeid argued."

“Many of those who have carried out terror attacks in Europe are born and raised in France and Belgium. It shows how important it is to succeed with integration and that is again connected to how many come to Norway. Therefore a tight immigration policy is important,” she said.
Listhaug's package of asylum and immigration reforms is due before parliament shortly.
Not like Sweden
In the aftermath of the terror attacks in Brussels there has been a debate on so-called parallel societies and neighbourhoods where the police don't dare to patrol.
The Progress Party's immigration spokesman Mazyar Keshvari told Klassekampen on Sunday that parallel societies also exist in Norway, pointed to Groruddalen and Søndre Nordstrand in Oslo.
Listhaug acknowledged that the problem exists.
“It is obvious that we do have problems, one needs only look at the social statistics,” Listhaug told NTB.
“We have foreign fighters who have left Norway and [we have] radical environments. We should not stick our heads in the sand and say that everything is good here. But fortunately we are a long way from the conditions we see in some other countries, for example Sweden,” she said.
She said that a major reason that Norway doesn't have the same ghetto problems as Sweden is that refugees and asylum seekers in Norway cannot decide for themselves where they should live.
Biometrics
Listhaug said that the terror attack in Brussels has created fears and worries that an attack could also hit Norway. But she also stressed that Islamists where not responsible for the terror that stuck the nation in 2011.
“That goes to show that one can be blinded by the illusion that only Islamists carry out terror. But [intelligence agency] PST's threat assessment for 2016 states that extreme Islamists present the greatest terror and that is something we have to deal with,” the integration minister said.
Among Listhaug's proposals is to expand the ability of law enforcement agencies to acquire and store biometric information such as fingerprints. She said that it is important to have control over who is in Norway and that PST needs to determine whether asylum applicants present a security threat.
Must 'make demands'
Listhaug's proposals were sent to parliamentary hearing at the beginning of the year. Many of them have been criticised for preventing – whether than promoting – integration.
Critics have referred to specific proposals, such as the plan to make it more difficult for refugees to bring their family members to Norway, but have also said that the sum of the proposals will make it more difficult for refugees to get a foothold in Norway and a sense of belonging.
“I am focused on making some demands of those who come to Norway. For example, it is important that those who will bring family members here can provide for them. That is an important principle,” Listhaug said.
She said ensuring better integration ‘requires a special effort”.
“It's not like we can make plans and then everything will just fall in place, or that there is a ""quick fix,"" she said."

“The conflict in Syria has created the largest refugee crisis in our time. The international community must step up its efforts to help refugees and civilians in need in Syria and the neighbouring countries,” Solberg said. ""I believe the UN will be happy to accept this offer.”
Jensen, who serves as minister of finance in Norway's ruling right-wing coalition, said that she hoped the conference would be part of an “extraordinary international effort”.
“Through this initiative, we hope to mobilise more funding to support the Syrian refugees and the host communities in the neighbouring countries, as well as enhancing humanitarian efforts within Syria,”
So far the United Nations has raised just $2.7bn of the $7.4bn it has asked for to help pay for relief and refugee camps in Turkey and Lebanon, which have together received four million refugees, and in Syria, where eight million people are displaced.
Jan Egeland, Secretary General of the Norwegian Refugee Council, said that the decision was “gratifying”, adding that the recent decisions to increase spending on aid for refugees would gave Norway moral authority.
“Now the Norwegian government has greater credibility and weight as the largest donor in the world, measured by the country's size,” he said.

“We must uphold the structures we have. It isn't like an asylum seeker can choose which country their case is handled in. The first country in which they are registered should handle their case,” she told Aftenposten.
The head of the Norwegian Directorate of Immigration (UDI) estimated that between 4,000 and 5,000 of the roughly 33,000 asylum seekers who came to Norway in 2015 will be returned to other countries under the Dublin Regulation, which states that asylum seekers should have their cases processed by the first EU member state that they entered.
Norway, while not a member of the EU, has a separate agreement with the union to apply the regulation.
The Nordic nation is looking to send some 860 asylum seekers, including around 50 Syrians, to Hungary, which has been criticised for its heavy-handed treatment of refugees and migrants. Norway filed an official request with Hungary at the end of November and an answer is expected by the end of January.
The Norwegian Organization for Asylum (NOAS) said it worries about the safety of asylum seekers that will be sent back to Hungary, pointing to an Austrian report that concluded that Hungary is unsafe for refugees.
Likewise, the Norwegian Embassy in Budapest warned the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs last summer that “xenophobia in Hungary is at an historically high level”.
Hungary, for its part, said that asylum seekers should not be sent back its way.
“Everyone is obligated to seek asylum in the first country they come to, but you just need to look at our borders – Hungary can't be the first asylum country. The refugees passed other countries' borders before they came to Hungary,” the country's ambassador to Norway, Anna-Marie Sikó, told Aftenposten.
According to Aftenposten, it has already been decided that roughly 400 Syrian asylum seekers will be returned to other EU countries. Of those, 88 are children."

Per Sandberg, the deputy leader of Norway's Progress Party, wore the T-shirt as he led a resolution at the party's annual conference on Sunday which voted to block a Labour party proposal to accept 10,000 Syrian refugees.
Jonas Spildrejordet, a spokesman for Norway’s opposition Labour Party, described the T-shirt as “beyond distasteful” in a tweet on Monday.
""Per Sandberg has said and done a lot of things. Some careless, some thoughtless, some stupid,"" he added in a later tweet. ""But this shirt thing is simply nauseatingly nasty.""
Sandberg normally revels in his status as a loose cannon in the anti-immigrant wing of the party. But when he was approached by Norway’s Dagens Næringsliv newspaper over the T-Shirt, he claimed that any connection to the subject of the vote was a ‘coincidence’.
“My message comes from what I say, not from a random T-shirt that is the first thing I picked out of my wardrobe,” he told the paper.

Kjell Lars Berge, professor of Norwegian language at the University of Oslo, was in no doubt that the politician was trying to send a message.
""There is certainly no lower limit,"" he told Norway's Dagbladet newspaper. ""This is a little rough, when there are people dying at sea.""
Emil André Erstad, leader of the Christian Democrats youth party, scoffed at the idea that the T-shirt was accidental, posting a collection of photos of Sandberg on Twitter to demonstrate that he has seldom if ever been seen wearing a T-shirt to a party event.

According to the service, between five and ten of the 1,000 Syrians chosen to go to Norway by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), were discovered to have links to the one of the two terror groups.
“Unfortunately, there are some who try to exploit and abuse the refugee agency,” Police Superintendent Svein Erik Molstad told Norway's Dagbladet newspaper. “We have discovered more quota refugees with ties to the al-Nusra front and IS,” he said.
PST investigators have so far made two trips to the Middle East, where it works with Norway's Foreign Ministry to vet refugees passed to Norway under the UN's quota system.
According to Molstad, the investigations have also uncovered refugees with backgrounds in Syria's feared secret police, as well as others suspected of carrying out war crime's during the country's ongoing civil war.
Although PST is now working in the Middle East, its officers neither interview nor have other direct contact with prospective refugees.
Dagbladet has also learned of Islamic extremists using refugee reception centres as recruiting grounds for terrorists.
“It's a scenario we are aware of,” Martin Bernsen, PST's director told the newspaper.
Dagbladet has information that several people who have received asylum in Norway have later become central in the radicalized Islamic community in the country.

The Norwegian Directorate of Immigration (UDI) confirmed to broadcaster NRK that the first 20 of the 1,500 refugees Norway voluntarily agreed to accept as part of the EU's relocation scheme will be flown into Norway from Italy this week.
The Norwegian parliament decided in December that the country's contribution to the EU programme, which as a non-member it is not obligated to participate in, would be 750 refugees this year and 750 in 2017. The relocate refugees are to come from Greece and Italy to ease the burden on those countries.
Although the agreements with Greece and Italy were finalized by April, none of the 1,500 refugees have set foot on Norwegian soil. But that is due to change this week. The first round of 20 refugees will be Eritreans, according to UDI.
Agency spokeswoman Elisabeth Qvam, said that Norway has received documents on the relevant asylum seekers from the Italian authorities and that UDI is considering based on certain criteria.
“It's not as if we are sending people from UDI to pick amongst them,” she said.
The first refugees will arrive from Italy to Østfold Arrival Center in Råde on Thursday and will be held there for two or three days for registration and health checks.
Although these asylum seekers are being directly delivered to Norway, no one is guaranteed asylum.
“They are treated like everyone else who comes to the country,” Østfold Arrival Center manager Helge Ekelund said.

1,114 ordinary asylum seekers so far this year represents a decrease of almost a third from last year’s figures.
But if relocated asylum seekers – mainly from Syria and Eritrea – are included, the figure changes to a 40 percent increase, reports Norwegian news agency NTB.
A total of 110 asylum seekers of minor age have arrived in the country so far in 2017, a 32.5 percent reduction on the equivalent figure from last year, according to the report.
The low numbers for both 2016 and 2017 have given UDI cause to adjust its prognosis for the rest of the year to a total of 3,000, in addition to 1,250 who will arrive through the EU’s relocation arrangement with Norway.
This would mean a total far lower than the 10,000 expected at this time last year, reports NTB.
READ ALSO: Asylum seeker arrivals in Norway 'lowest since 1997'
The primary reason for the drop is the reduced number of asylum seekers coming to Europe at all, says the report, with Italy the only exception, with a 19 percent increase before the peak summer period is taken into account.
Italy’s figures are unlikely to have a significant effect on Norway.
“Many of the people who come from Libya to Italy come from countries in West Africa and Asia such as Bangladesh and Pakistan, and don’t typically apply for asylum in Norway. Furthermore, many of them are not refugees,” UDI director Frode Forfang told NTB.
That situation could change should Italy receive more asylum seekers from Eritrea, Ethiopia or Sudan, who are more likely to look to Norway for asylum, according to NTB’s report.
“The situation and prognosis for the rest of the year is quite uncertain. Normally more people come in the second half of the year than the first half, but last year did not see such an increase,” Forfang said.
UDI has now begun to adjust its capacity, with asylum facilities gradually being closed down in response to the new prognosis and lower asylum seeker arrivals.

“This makes as vulnerable for changes in pattern. It has also created difficulties for operators and municipalities,” Forfang told the news agency.
The reduction in flow has enabled UDI to reduce numbers of pending applications from 14,000 to 3,000 over the last year.
Almost half of the 31,150 asylum seekers that came to Norway in 2015 have now had their applications processed, according to the report.

Denmark and Norway both placed within the top three of countries giving money to support humanitarian action for Syrian refugees, according to a new report from charity Oxfam.
The report, published by the organisation ahead of a donor conference co-hosted by Norway in London on Thursday, measures the contributions of individual countries against what Oxfam assesses as being a ‘fair' amount. The ‘fair' amount is calculated based on funding made available relative to gross national income.
See also: Norway: Double financial support for Syria
According the report, both Denmark and Norway contributed over three times their ‘fair share' of funding for response to the Syrian crisis in 2015, with Norway at 385 percent and Denmark at 318 percent of their respective ‘fair' contributions. Only Kuwait, with a 554 percent contribution, trumped the Danish and Norwegian efforts.
The lowest country in the table was Russia, with just one percent of its 'fair' contribution. Oil-rich Gulf states Saudi Arabia and Qatar came in at 28 and 18 percent respectively.
""Look at Norway, Belgium, and Kuwait. They have given much more than their fair share in aid. How can France, Saudi Arabia, and Russia explain their shortfalls?"" Oxfam Andy Baker said in a press release.
Denmark, which is cutting 2.3 billion kroner in development aid, fared considerably worse than Norway in a second Oxfam analysis which measured the number of refugees accepted by individual countries signed up to the UN Refugee Convention.
Based on what Oxfam terms ‘resettlement and humanitarian pledges' – the number of refugees each country has promised to take in in 2016 set in proportion to gross national income – the report finds that Denmark has only promised 16 percent of its fair contribution.
Norway stands at 260 percent in the resettlement analysis, making it the top scorer of any country. Oxfam touted Norway's tradition of having ""consistently shown generosity in resettling refugees"", although that praise comes at time when the United Nations has criticized Norway for sending rejected asylum seekers to Norway and proposing to make refugees and foreigners wait four years before bringing their family members into the country.
Along with Norway, only Germany, Canada and Australia were considered to have met the organisation's ‘fair' criteria for resettlement. Russia has not agreed to resettle any refugees so far in 2016, according to the report."

The report, based on data from OECD countries, was published by Norwegian research institute Inclusion and Diversity Directorate (Inkluderings- og mangfoldsdirektoratet – IMDi), and shows that Norway beats both Denmark and Sweden as well as a series of other EU countries on figures for immigrant education, employment and income.
But Norway's relative integration success is not necessarily a direct result of country's immigration policies.
The report said that Norway's strong economic growth and a large number of available jobs are the main reasons it outpaces its neighbours when it comes to integration. Additionally, Sweden has received the most refugees over the last ten years, while Norway has received the most working migrants, who are easier to get into employment.
The IMDi report measured integration by examining employment, education and living conditions among immigrants generally and young people with immigrant backgrounds in particular. In Norway, 28 percent of those aged 15 and 34 who have immigrant backgrounds are either employed or in education.
“The report shows that there are still major differences within Norway, and we definitely have big challenges. But if we compare ourselves with other countries on immigrants' employment, education level and income level, we score rather well,” Kristian Rose Tronstad, a researcher with the Norwegian Institute for City and Regional Research (Norsk institutt for by- og regionforskning), who wrote the IMDi report, told VG.
“[But] I would be cautious about saying that everything is rosy,” added Tronstad.
The report shows that 37 percent of immigrants in Norway are in higher education – the highest level in Scandinavia – and that this percentage is increasing year on year.
More immigrants are also in employment in Norway compared Denmark, Sweden and the most of the EU – the Norwegian employment level of 71 percent is beaten only by Iceland, Switzerland and Luxembourg. Some 66 percent of female immigrants are also working in Norway – a result way ahead of any other country. Immigrants in Norway also earn more than their Scandinavian counterparts, but the report said that much of that could be ascribed to the generally higher wages in Norway
However, many immigrants – both highly educated migrants and second-generation immigrants – are relatively poor at Norwegian, according to the report, which also finds that young people in the age range 15-34 are more likely to become marginalized than ethnic Norwegians.
The report also found that despite having the lowest immigrant unemployment rates, immigrants and those with immigrant backgrounds are still twice as likely to find themselves outside of the labour market than ethnic Norwegians."

With a chant of “four more years”, Erna Solberg's Conservative (Høyre) party and the nationalist Progress Party (Fremskrittspartiet) coalition saw off the Labour challenge in Norway's legislative elections on August 11th.
Solberg will continue in the role of prime minister with a new four-year term of office, albeit with a weaker mandate.
The electoral campaign was largely based on a referendum on taxes, energy and immigration policy.
On the contentious issue of immigration and integration, the Conservatives ran a straightforward campaign but they did come under fire for some of the attention-seeking, anti-immigrant antics of Sylvi Listhaug, the Progress Party Minister for Integration and Immigration.
Listhaug was widely criticized for pulling an emotive pre-election publicity stunt by visiting the Stockholm suburb of Rinkeby in Sweden, ostensibly to highlight problems of criminality in what she has claimed is one of “60 no-go zones” in Sweden.
While she denied this was her intention, rightly or wrongly it was clearly designed as a warning to Norwegian voters on the dangers posed by uncontrolled immigration. Pre-election opinion polls had shown that 20 percent of voters felt that immigration and asylum issues were an important electoral issue.

However, while the Progress Party proclaims itself as an anti-immigration party, it is a party that is less authoritarian and nationalistic than some of its more extreme European populist counterparts. According to the late Frank Aarebrot, professor of comparative politics, “The Progress Party cannot be compared to the Front National in France or the Danish People's Party or German neo-Nazi groups”.
In 2015, Norway's parliament rushed through legislation in to allow deportations of people, mainly Syrians, trying to enter the country. The plight of migrants, mainly from Syria, attempting to get into Norway by cycling across the artic border crossing shared by Russia sparked intense debate on the issue.
The refugee crisis, which saw over 31,000 people apply for asylum in Norway, led to several changes on family reunification regulation in Norway. Stricter reform proposals were steered to some degree by the Progress Party with new rules in terms of economic self-sufficiency, and an increase in waiting periods was debated.
The Progress Party may have toned down some of its more extreme utterances, but external factors such as the fall in oil prices and the migrant crisis in 2015 provided an unexpected boost for the party.
The migrant crisis mobilized thinking on the dangers of uncontrolled immigration. Family reunification reforms were steered to some degree by the Progress Party, with policies tightened through demands on economic self-sufficiency and an increase in waiting periods.
Some of the more restrictive new family reunification rules have been criticized by the Pakistani-Norwegian community, one of the largest immigrant groups in Norway. The community argues that a 15-month processing time is too long and has an adverse effect. The minimum age of spouses trying to get into Norway, 24 years of age, is also a bone of contention.
The Eurosceptic, populist Progress Party has sought renegotiation on a directive that entitles EU and EEA citizens living in Norway to so-called “benefit exports”: child welfare payments, at Norwegian payment rates, to EU citizens living in Norway, even if their families live abroad.
Legislative changes have thus far had a limited impact on the living situations of EU residents in Norway, however.
Catherine Townsley, from Belfast, says the benefits of living and working in Norway far outweigh the minor inconveniences she encountered.
“I've had no real problem as an EU citizen apart from the paperwork involved, and it's worth noting that the rules for residency changed three times this year when I was applying,” Townsley told The Local.
“It does make the process so much easier if you have a job before moving to Norway,” adds Townsley, currently on maternity leave from her job at an Oslo-based biotech company where she has been impressed by Norwegian gender equality in the workplace.
Neither is the new term given to the Conservative-Progress alliance likely to result in a hardening of policy on the EU, says Lise Rye, associate professor, at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology's Department of Historical Studies.
""A change in Norway's association with the EU in the upcoming period is not likely. The Progress party did come out as EU membership opponents last year, and has called for an update of the EEA Agreement for years. The Conservative party remains, however, a staunch defender of the EEA Agreement and will not yield,” Rye told The Local.
“Having said that, the new Norwegian parliament is more Eurosceptic than ever. The traditional dividing-line between pro-European politicians and a Eurosceptic population is crumbling, and pro-EEA parties no longer hold the three-quarter majority that new surrenders of sovereignty take. The composition of the new parliament also suggests that Norway is more likely to refuse controversial pieces of EU legislation in the upcoming period than what has been the case in the past,” she added.
Border control is another hot topic. Norway is part of the Schengen zone, but has asked for border controls to be extended. Schengen is often criticized by nationalists and Eurosceptics as being an open door to criminals. Societal problems related to the cultures and religion of immigrants rather is an oft-cited factor – as opposed to economic and work factors – as parties have debated the topic.

The view that Norwegian values and culture such as gender equality and freedom of expression are under threat appears to be gaining momentum.
The Conservative-Progress Party coalition has been open in criticizing the left for not recognizing this view and being out of touch with the electorate. Solberg was vocal in the media on the need for acceptance of the cultural practices of ethnic Norwegians, such as not using religious justification for not serving alcohol in a work-related context. The same goes for the wearing of hijab in public service. Listhaug called for a ban on the practice of children wearing hijabs in kindergarten.
The migrant crisis has now subsided, with only 2,600 applications for asylum this year.
In some ways, it might seem as if the Roma people became the scapegoats for an anti-foreign backlash reaction. Early in the year, state television broadcaster NRK sparked debate by portraying the Roma beggars as engaging in organized crime and exploitation under cover of begging. The screening of the documentary film, “Lykkeland”, led the government to seek the reintroduction of a ban on begging.
The new government is still in its infancy and Erna Solberg will need the support of the two smaller centre-right parties. One of these, the Christian Democrats, has already said that it will not support a government that includes the Progress Party.
Progress leader Siv Jensen, meanwhile, has already made a pre-election vow “to continue the fight for a strict immigration policy”.
""Generally, it will be business as usual in Norway because both of the major political alternatives, the left and the right, accept our crucial arrangements: Universal welfare policies and a strong cooperation in the labour market – government,"" Svein Tuastad, political scientist at University of Stavanger, told The Local.
“Actually, there are two sorts of veto against the progress party. Firstly, the government ally Høyre has to agree and secondly, the proposals have to be accepted in parliament, and the Labour party and others will stop any dramatic proposals,” he added.
In the end, there is one thing all the parties agree upon across the political spectrum: the preservation of Norway's treasured welfare state.

Germany on Wednesday suspended the Dublin regulation, which since 1997 has meant that refugees should seek asylum in the first country they arrive at within the European Union.
“Angela Merkel took a leadership position in Europe by stopping sending back Syrians under the Dublin Agreement. Now I want to ask the Norwegian Government to do the same,” Knut Arild Hareide, leader of Christian Democrat party, told Aftenposten on Sunday.
“In reality, the system based around the Dublin Agreement has already collapsed because of the situation we are in now.”
On Monday, the Socialist Left Party backed Hareide's call, while Ann-Magritt Austenå, Secretary General of the Norwegian Organisation for Asylum Seekers (NOAS), attacked Solberg's refusal to respond to the demand.
“It's totally shabby,” she told NTB. “Why should Erna Solberg be so much less of a stateswoman in this than Angela Merkel?”
Jan Egeland, Secretary General of the Norwegian Refugee Council said that the Dublin agreement should be scrapped.
“I think the whole Dublin scheme belongs on the scrap heap of history,” he said. “It was created in a very different time.”
According to the Police Immigration Service, Norway has already expelled 634 asylum seekers under the Dublin regulation this year, many of them being returned to Italy.
On Sunday, Solberg said that, while Norway would no longer send refugees back to Greece, it would continue to apply the Dublin agreement for all other cases.
""Most Syrians arrive via Greece, where we already have a scheme under which Norway does not send people back under the Dublin regulation,"" she said.
""To say that as a general rule, we should not return refugees to the country where they arrived, even if that country receives significantly fewer refugees that us and has less stress in its systems, I don't agree with. If Syrians arrive in countries such as Denmark and the Netherlands, there is no reason why these countries should not take responsibility.""
A survey for Norway's Aftenposten newspaper, published on Friday, showed that 63 percent of Norwegians now thought it was right for Norway to take in 8,000 Syrian refugees, the quota agreed by the parliament, compared to 25 percent against."

Jøran Kallmyr, state secretary at the Ministry of Justice, plans to soon travel to Eritrea to seek pledges from the Eritrean government that it respect the human rights of returnees.
”If they have been refused a residence permit, it is likely that we can send them back before the end of 2015 if we reach a return agreement,” Kallmyr told Norwegian broadcaster TV2. ”We hope for two good days in Eritrea with great conversations. We expect that the Eritreans will increasingly comply with human rights.”
The UN has recently expressed grave concern regarding the human rights situation in Eritrea, and does not expect it to improve.
A recent UN-mandated inquiry found that there was a clear pattern of human rights abuse in the country.
”Detention is an ordinary fact of life, experienced by an inordinate number of individuals – men and women, old and young, including children,” Mike Smith, Chair of the Commission of Inquiry on Human Rights in Eritrea said at a press conference in March.
""Detention centres range from official to the unofficial, located above ground or underground. Some have metal containers where prisoners are kept in extreme heat. Once in one of them, there is a likelihood that you will be subject to torture to extract a confession or to simply punish behaviours.""
Most Eritrean asylum seekers in Norway have left the country to avoid its brutal national service regime, which can last a lifetime and includes forced labour.
Karin de Gruijl told the BBC that most Eritrean asylum seekers arriving in Europe are between 18 and 24 years of age.
""This intensification of recruitment has sparked fear among young people in this age group who don't want to have this perspective of not knowing how long they will have to serve,"" she told the news channel.
Officially, the Eritrean conscription lasts for 18 months, however reports from the country show signs that forced national service is increasing."

					16:21 CEST+02:00				",The Local,Norway's hardline asylum bill heads to parliament,"A long-awaited asylum and integration proposal was formally presented to parliament on Tuesday.
The final version of the bill saw the Norwegian government scaling back its controversial requirements on family reunificaiton for refugees, saying that it will be enough for them to have been employed or in education for three years before bringing their family to Norway instead of the original four-year proposal.
Even with the reduction from four to three years, the family reunificaiton rules will be much stricter than they are today, primarily because of changes to the so-called ‘maintenance requirement' (underholdskravet), which will now require that refugees can support their family members from day one before they can be brought to Norway.
Integration Minister Sylvi Listhaug, who represents the anti-immigration Progress Party (Fremskrittspartiet), has been criticized by opposition parties and a number of outside agencies for the 40-point plan she introduced in December.
The 150-page document has now been through its hearing phase and was presented to parliament on Tuesday.
In the final version, the so-called 24-year-old proposal for family reunification remained in place, barring all under-24s from obtaining spousal reunification, as did a controversial proposal to give all unaccompanied minor asylum seekers only temporary residence until they turn 18.
Refugees will have to be in Norway for five years, instead of the current three, before they can achieve permanent residency or extend their temporary permits, but the government backed off its self-sufficiency requirements, saying now that foreigners must only be employed for 12 months before achieving permanent residency rather than the originally proposed three years.
It was also reported on Tuesday that the government has a political majority behind a plan to allow police to jail “groundless” asylum seekers for up to 72 hours as their cases are processed.
Prime Minister Erna Solberg said that none of the government's asylum and immigration plans would run afoul of international conventions.
“We are on solid ground,” she said. “It's important to remember that [the UN's] High Commissioner [for Refugees - UNHCR] has an activist position on what human rights are. It's not an objective organ,” she told NTB.
“Our position is that the proposal is clearly within the refugee conventions,” she added.
The UNHCR said in January that it was ""deeply concerned"" by Norway's plans to tighten rules for family reunifications and said the Norwegian government's decision to send migrants back to Russia was ""cause for concern"".
A total of 35,358 asylum seekers arrived in Norway in 2015, compared with just 11,480 in the previous year. Figures released by the Norwegian Immigration Directorate on Tuesday showed that 942 people have sought asylum through the first three months of 2016. That is down from 1,670 in the same period last year."

Somalia's new President Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed, known as Farmajo, announced Hassan Ali Khaire's appointment over Twitter on Thursday, just a day after he was inaugurated.
Khaire, 46, who came to Norway as a refugee in the late 80s, has like most of his compatriots taken advantage of an exemption Norway gives Somalis from its ban on dual citizenship.
Mazyar Keshvari, the Progress Party's immigration spokesman has argued that Khaire's appointment as his country's leader removed any justification for his dual citizenship.
“He should be deprived of his Norwegian passport,” he told Norwegian broadcaster NRK. “A country's prime minister cannot have multiple nationalities. If conflicts occur, where they will their loyalties lie?”
The appointment of Khaire, who has degrees from the University of Oslo and the University of Edinburgh, marks a major step forward in Somalia's attempt to establish a functioning government following 25 years of civil war and failed government.
Khaire, a former regional director for the Norwegian Refugee Council and later an executive with London's Soma Oil and Gas, is seen as a capable administrator.
But Keshvari suggested it might be time to end the special treatment of Somali citizens, particularly those who take senior positions in the country's emerging government.
“When someone has been appointed a Member of Parliament and even the Prime Minister of Somalia, we have to assume that they are Somali nationals,” he said.
“The fact that he has now become Prime Minister clearly shows that his need for protection should be seen as temporary and not permanent in nature.”
Dual citizenship is permitted by most countries in Europe, including Norway's neighbours Sweden, Finland, and Denmark, but it is banned in Norway.
Norway's Green Party has proposed that Norway follow Denmark, which passed a dual citizenship bill in December 2014.
In February 2016, a leaked memo sent by a UN watchdog to diplomats in the UK and Norway, revealed that Khaire was under investigation by UK's Serious Fraud Office (SFO) for possible ties to extremist groups in East Africa, including al-Shabaab.
The SFO's enquiry was closed in December 2016,
""The SFO has concluded, based on the information and material we have obtained, that there is insufficient evidence to provide a realistic prospect of conviction,"" an SFO spokesman told the Daily Telegraph."

Taken together with the 174 asylum seekers who crossed the border on Monday (also a record), this week looks set to beat last week's historically high refugee inflow of 793 — more than half of whom are Afghan.
Norway's Storskog border crossing is the only place along Norway's 196km border with Russia where crossing from one country to the other is permitted.
The normally quiet border crossing has seen more than 3,000 refugees arrive so far this year, the majority of them riding bicycles to circumvent a requirement from the Russian side that the border cannot be crossed on foot.
Norway has started building new refugee accommodation at the airport in the nearby town of Kirkenes, where the refugees can stay before being flown south.
Norway immigration authorities on Monday sent out a message over Twitter warning any Afghans crossing the border that they risked being repatriated, not simply back across the border to Russ — where many have been living — but to Kabul.
The tweet marks the first sign of a new negative social media campaign by Norwegian authorities aimed at reducing the numbers of refugees seeking asylum in the country."

""The Russian foreign affairs minister was in contact yesterday (Friday) with the Norwegian authorities on the subject of the return of asylum seekers via Storskog,"" the foreign ministry said in a statement, referring to the Storskog border crossing, 400 kilometres (about 250 miles) north of the Arctic Circle.
""Until further notice, there will not be any more returns via Storskog. The Russian border authorities want more coordination over these returns,"" the statement added.
Speaking in Davos to Norwegian television channel NRK, Norwegian Foreign Affairs Minister Borge Brende said the Russians had made the request citing ""security reasons"".
Some 5,500 migrants -- mostly from Syria, Afghanistan, Iraq and Iran -- crossed from Russia into Norway last year, on the last leg of an arduous journey through the Arctic to Europe.
Norway is not within the European Union, but is a member of the Schengen passport-free zone.
Many migrants arrived by bicycle as Russian authorities do not let people cross the border on foot and Norway considers people driving migrants across the border in a car or truck to be traffickers.
In November 2015, its right-wing government decided that migrants who had been living legally in Russia, or had entered Russia legally, should be immediately returned there, on the basis that Russia is a safe country.
Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova told AFP that Moscow had informed Norway on Friday that it was halting the return of migrants through the Borisoglebsk-Storskog crossing in line with a 2011 bilateral agreement.
Exceptions will, however, be made for any migrants who can be shown to meet the criteria of an earlier agreement that obliges Moscow to readmit them if they do not fulfil Norwegian immigration laws and have valid Russian visas or residence permits.
""The steps taken by Russia were dictated by security reasons and based on bilateral agreements with Norway,"" Zakharova said.
Police police returned 13 migrants by bus to Russia on Tuesday.
Two similar operations were scheduled for Thursday and Friday but were then cancelled, for what officials said were logistical reasons.
Several dozen migrants had been taken to the border town of Kirkenes ahead of their expulsion, but several fled and three were given shelter in a church.
Rights groups had expressed outrage at the migrants being forced to return by bike in winter, when temperatures in the far north regularly fall to minus 20 degrees Celsius (minus four Fahrenheit).
They also say that Russia has a poor record on dealing with requests for asylum.
The process can take years, during which applicants run the risk of being arrested and expelled to their country of origin, said Marek Linha, head of the Norwegian Organisation for Asylum Seekers (NOAS).
""It's Russian roulette, because you have no guarantee of gaining asylum, you often have to pay bribes and you can have problems with the FSB,"" Russia's security service, Linha said.
Out of roughly 5,000 Syrians who have filed for refugee status in Russia over the last six years, only two have been granted recognition, according to the figures from the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).
Around 2,900 Syrians have been granted temporary protection, which campaigners say is insufficient."

On Tuesday the right-wing Norwegian coalition government called on police authorities to tighten checks in the border areas as the country experiences an unprecedented influx of refugees. The Scandinavian nation shares a 1,630 kilometre border with Sweden.
“In a situation of increasing asylum arrivals, it is important that Norwegian authorities at as early a stage as possible can ascertain the identity and history of those coming to the country. This is partly to prevent illegal immigration and fight transnational crime,” Norway's Justice Minister Anders Anundsen said in a press statement quoted by the NRK broadcaster.
Sweden's western neighbour has come under increasing pressure in the past months to accept more refugees, with the 2,760 applications received over the last three months only adding up to 534 per head of population, compared to 1,467 per head received in Sweden.
But the rising number of asylum claims in Norway shot up by 81 percent between April and June this year, the third steepest increase experienced by any other European country. Sweden's applications rose by 25 percent in the same period, according to Eurostat.

Norway's decision comes less than a week after Sweden's other neighbour, Finland, announced it too was stepping up border controls after an unexpected wave of mostly Iraqi asylum seekers.
It follows moves by other countries, such as Germany, Austria and Slovakia, to introduce checks after saying they could not longer cope with record influx into their territories.
But Sweden, which takes in the second-largest number of asylum seekers in the EU, has insisted it will not follow suit in the near future.
“We are not close to such a situation,” vowed Prime Minister Stefan Löfven at a joint press conference with European Parliament President Martin Schultz last week.

Norwegian ministers on Tuesday left it up to police authorities themselves to decide exactly how to strengthen border controls and when to implement the proposed checks.
“It is important to emphasize that this is not about reintroducing systematic individual controls at the border crossing. (...) Nor is it intended to cut the right to seek asylum in Norway for people fleeing,” said Anundsen, who represents Norway's populist Progress Party in a coalition government with Prime Minister Erna Solberg's Conservatives.

The asylum reforms agreed in Norway's parliament on Thursday have been widely seen as a victory for the anti-immigrant Progress party, the junior partner in Norway's ruling coalition.
“If all these measures work, Norway will probably be the strictest country in Europe, along with Denmark,” Sandberg told Norway's NTB newswire. “The political environment in Norway has taken a major step towards the Progress party.”
Sandberg pointed out that the sharp rise in the number of refugees coming into Norway in recent months had increased support for his party's anti-immigration stance.
“It's a completely different climate,” he said. “The reality has now come home for the other parties too.”
Labour leader Jonas Gahr Støre denied that the other parties had given Progress exactly what it wanted.
“Progress is simply making a sales pitch to its own ranks,” he said. “The fact that Progress has supported some of these reforms does not make them worse: it is the content we need to consider, not who supports it.”
The Danish People's Party, Progress's Danish counterpart, has long boasted, not without cause, that the immigration laws it has pushed Denmark's governments to enact since 2002 are “Europe's strictest”.

""We see a tendency that those coming through Storskog have stayed in other countries besides Syria for some time,"" he said.
At Fjellhallen transit center in Kirkenes, NRK journalists spoke to many refugees who had lived a long time in Russia, often years, and who had received work or student visas.
The number of refugees entering Norway through the Storskog border crossing near Kirkenes has shot up this year, with more than 500 arriving this year.
Many of the refugees have made the crossing on bicycles, as it is illegal to cross on foot according to Russian border regulations.
However, some of the refugees complained that conditions in Russia were harsh for Syrians, with little chance of making a living.
""Russia doesn't give us anything. If they catch you working, they throw you in prison,"" Khalil, a 23-year-old Syrian refugee told NRK. ""You can stay in Russia, but you are not allowed to work or do anything.""
Only those Syrians who have entered through Russia after avoiding registration by police are likely to be granted asylum."

Since the start of the year, some 1,100 Syrians have entered the Schengen zone -- of which Norway is a member, even though it is not a part of the EU -- by crossing the Arctic and the Storskog border station dividing northern Russia and Norway.
""We see that some of those who are arriving via Storskog have lived legally in Russia for a long time,"" Norwegian Justice Minister Anders Anundsen told public broadcaster NRK. ""This means they are not fleeing war, poverty or famine, and so they don't really need to seek safe haven in Norway. They already have safe haven in Russia,"" he said, adding that Oslo and Moscow had a pre-existing agreement on such matters.
According to NRK, Anundsen will send a memo to immigration authorities urging them to prioritise the return of these people. The details of the memo were not immediately known.
Norwegian Foreign Minister Børge Brende said he had raised the issue with his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov during a meeting in Finland on Wednesday. While the Arctic route is a long detour, it is much safer for migrants who want to avoid perilous Mediterranean crossings.
Refugees have been crossing the Storskog border by bicycle, as Russian regulations do not allow people to cross the border on foot and Norwegian authorities consider it human trafficking to transport refugees across the border in a car.

“Our Schengen border at Storskog has full border controls, but many asylum seekers come anyway. People think that putting in controls will mean fewer asylum seekers. That isn't correct,” she told VG.
The PM said on Tuesday that Sweden's decision could help Norway.
“Now that Sweden has implemented border controls, it will help us. But it could also mean that more people will come to Norway via boat from Germany and Denmark. [We are putting in controls] to keep the Danish ferry and the Kiel ferry from becoming the new influx point,” Solberg told NRK.

The man in his mid-30s was held on remand at an appearance at the Nordhordland Municipal Court on Friday afternoon.
According to Bergens Tidende, the man was first brought in as a possible witness in the case but police found parts of his explanation to be suspicious.
“It was based on his movements on the night of the fire,” Hordaland police prosecutor Harald Bilnerg told NTB.
More arrests likely
The accused man is of eastern European origin and lives in Nordhordland. According to Bergens Tidende, an additional personal has been charged and police suspect several other people of being involved in the fire.
The police said that more arrests of people described as being from the same environment would be coming.
The man in his 30s denies having started the fire at Hotel Lune Huler on Sunday. The hotel was scheduled to house 40 underage asylum seekers after the start of the new year.

The proposal is similar to one in Denmark that will allow Danish authorities to seize asylum seekers' cash exceeding 10,000 kroner (1,340 euros, $1,450), as well as any individual items valued at more than 10,000 kroner. Wedding rings and other items of sentimental value are exempt.

The Norwegian Refugee Council, an independent group that focuses on emergency aid, released the findings on Wednesday, ahead of a United Nations summit on Septermber 23rd aimed at getting nations focused on a global agreement for climate change. The report said that 22 million people were displaced in 2013 due to disasters brought on by natural hazards, nearly three times the number who were forced from their homes due to violence. The problem has been worsening, with roughly twice as many people displaced around the world due to disasters now than in the 1970s, even as better forecasting and relief operations have reduced the number of deaths. ""It's a wake-up call, I think, to world leaders coming here -- as bad as it is today, it would be dramatically worse unless much more is invested in resilience,"" said Jan Egeland, the Norwegian Refugee Council's secretary general. ""We have to make people in the Philippines or Chad or in Haiti as resilient as we are in Norway or in many parts of the United States,"" he told AFP. Egeland is the former UN emergency relief coordinator who played a high-profile role drumming up international support after the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami. He cited the experience as a model, saying that the more than $13 billion that poured in after the tsunami went not only for reconstruction but built up resilience for future disasters. Such an effort needs to happen on a global scale as ""we need to get people out of this vicious cycle of being vulnerable and therefore being hit very hard again,"" he said. UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has called Tuesday's summit to mobilize world leaders before the 2015 conference in Paris that is meant to draft a new global agreement on climate change.
The Norwegian study pointed to findings of a UN-led scientific panel, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which has said that human activity is contributing to the greater frequency and intensity of disasters around the planet. But the report said that a sharp rise in urbanization, and bad planning, were also factors in explaining the steep rise in disaster displacement. ""We are not saying here that it's climate change that has explained the increase. It's just as much, or more, population growth and urbanization, bad planning and more exposure to the elements,"" Egeland said. More than 80 percent of the people displaced by natural disasters last year were in Asia, the report found. The Philippines suffered the two most disruptive disasters last year, with typhoons Haiyan - also known as Yolanda - and Trami together displacing 5.8 million people. Relative to population size, eight of the 20 most disruptive natural disasters were in sub-Saharan Africa. The study warned of growing risks to Africa as the continent experiences higher population growth than other regions. Wealthy nations were not immune, with a typhoon in Japan's Chubu region, tornadoes in the US state of Oklahoma and floods in the Canadian province of Alberta together displacing nearly 600,000 people. The study also warned of growing risks of natural disasters hitting nations that are also in conflict. It pointed to the 2010 floods that swamped Pakistan as an example of a disaster hitting a fragile state."

Although Norway is not a member of the European Union, it is party to the Schengen agreement, which enables individuals to travel between 26 countries without border controls.

""Four foreign aid workers were kidnapped... their Kenyan driver died later while receiving treatment at a local hospital,"" Ndolo said, clarifying earlier reports that he had also been kidnapped.
Military helicopters and police chased the gunmen, who drove off with the hostages in their vehicle. It was later found abandoned, with fears the gang are heading towards Somalia, some 100 kilometres (60 miles) from Dadaab.
""We have dispatched military helicopters to pursue the kidnappers,"" Kenyan army spokesman Cyrus Oguna told AFP.
""The vehicle was found abandoned 30 kilometres (18 miles) from Daadab, and we believe the party is still within Kenyan borders, and the captives and their kidnappers are on foot,"" he added.

""A convoy from the Norwegian Refugee Council was involved in an incident in the refugee camp Dadaab,"" the NRC said in a statement, adding that its head Elisabeth Rasmusson had been travelling with the convoy but was unhurt and safe.
Medical officials with the German government aid agency GIZ said two other people were wounded in the attack, which took place in the sprawling Ifo 2 camp around midday.
The kidnapping is the latest in a series of attacks in the giant Dadaab complex, where gunmen last October seized two Spaniards working for Medecins sans Frontieres (Doctors Without Borders), Montserrat Serra and Blanca Thiebaut.
They are still being held hostage in Somalia.
The kidnapping of the Spaniards was one of the incidents that spurred Kenya to send troops and tanks into Somalia to fight the Al-Qaeda-linked Al-Shabaab insurgents Nairobi blames for abductions as well as for cross-border raids.
Al-Shabaab still control large parts of southern Somalia, despite recent losses to African Union troops, government forces and Ethiopian soldiers, who have wrested several key bases from the insurgents.
Kenya, which invaded southern Somalia in October before joining the AU force, has a heavy troop presence some 120 kilometres into Somalia from their frontier.
Since the 1991 ouster of then president Mohamed Siad Barre, Somalia has been variously governed by ruthless warlords and militia groups, each controlling their own limited fiefdoms.
Hundreds of thousands of Somalis have fled their lawless nation to neighbouring nations since the collapse of a formal government two decades ago, while crippling drought racked the region last year."

The two men and two women with the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) looked exhausted and were covered in dust after their three day ordeal, but managed a weary smile to reporters before they boarded buses and left the airport.
NRC said in a statement it was ""relieved and pleased"" at their release, naming them respectively as Steven Dennis, 37, Astrid Sehl, 33, Glenn Costes, 40 and Sadazai, 38.
Costes limped from a bullet wound to the leg, but the four appeared to be otherwise in good health after arriving from the southern Somali border town of Dhobley, where they been freed earlier on Monday.
""They were released by a joint force of Somali and Kenyan forces, during which one of the kidnappers was killed,"" Kenyan army spokesman Cyrus Oguna told AFP. Three others were arrested.
Mohamed Dini Adan, a Somali military commander in Dhobley, an area under control of Somali forces allied to Kenya, said the army had stopped the ""kidnappers who were trying to hide and sneak past the army.""
Somali forces heard reports the gunmen were heading for a dense remote forest some 25 kilometres from Dhobley, and rushed to hunt them down.
""Thanks to God we foiled their aims of taking the hostages into the forest,"" said Somali General Osmail Sahardid, who led the operation.
Residents in Dhobley said the local Ras Kamboni militia -- commanded by a former powerful Islamist warlord now allied to Kenya -- were also involved in the rescue.
Kenyan security forces scrambled military helicopters and aircraft after gunmen attacked the NRC convoy at around midday Friday in Dadaab, some 100 kilometres from Somalia, killing a Kenyan driver and wounding two others.
However, the aid workers' vehicle seized by the gunmen was found abandoned a few hours after the attack, and fears grew the gang had escaped with the hostages through the remote scrubland across the porous border into lawless Somalia.
Kenya, which invaded southern Somalia in October to attack Al-Qaeda-linked Shabaab insurgents, has troops some 120 kilometres deep into Somalia. However, the forces control only pockets of the vast territory.
""We are thankful to know that our four colleagues have been found and safely returned to Kenya. This is a day of relief for us and for the families of the abducted,"" the NRC chief Elisabeth Rasmusson said in a statement.
""Our thoughts go to the family of the NRC driver, Abdi Ali, who was killed during the attack on Friday, and to our two local employees who are currently undergoing treatment in hospital for injuries inflicted in the incident.
""The attack in Dadaab will stand as a tragic incident in NRC's history.""
The kidnapping was the latest in a series of attacks in Dadaab, where gunmen last October seized two Spaniards working for Medecins Sans Frontieres (Doctors Without Borders). They are still being held hostage in Somalia.
The abduction of the Spaniards was one of the incidents that spurred Kenya to send troops and tanks into Somalia to fight the hardline Al-Shabaab whom Nairobi blames for abductions and cross-border raids.

Some 5,500 refugees and migrants crossed into Norway from Russia by bike last year, sidestepping border agreements that make it illegal either to cross the border on foot or to give someone without papers a lift.
Now all of those refugees, primarily Syrians, who came via the Storskog border station -- just two hours drive from the Arctic City of Murmansk in Russia's far north -- will be sent back to Russia. That journey, too, will be made on two wheels.

The National Police Directorate Norway ( Politidirektoratet) has asked police districts to reclaim and refurbish the bicycles that were abandoned at Storskog.
“We asked that they bikes that were left behind or claimed by the police be gathered up for use by the foreigners who will be returned to Russia,” Jan Erik Thomassen, a Police Directorate section head, told broadcaster NRK.
“I can understand that it feels a bit awkward and odd,” he added.
Thomassen said that police are trying to avoid having refugees bike back to Russia, but that requires the cooperation of the Russians.
After Norway announced in November that it would immediately reject asylum seekers who have been residing in Russia, the two countries began sending the expelled back and forth.
But newly-appointed Integration Minister Sylvi Listhaug said on Tuesday that all migrants who crossed at Storskog would be sent back to Russia.
“It is very important for us to cooperate with the Russian authorities to get them to accept those who were sent here without a transit visa,” she told NRK.
The Norwegian Organization for Asylum (NOAS) was highly critical of Listhaug’s plan to send migrants back to Russia.
“Norway can’t return asylum seekers to Russia, which will in turn send them back to Syria. We have principles pertaining to international law that Norway must uphold,” Jon Ole Martinsen, a senior consultant with the group, told NRK."

According to Norway's VG newspaper, Norway's Police Security Service (PST) has received hundreds of tip offs from immigration officers about asylum seekers with potential terror sympathies.
“We have received a three-figure number of reports of concern from the Police Immigration Unit, from employees of PU, from UDI and from asylum centres,” Erik Haugland, a PST section chief told VG. “Our job is to evaluate these messages.”
According to Haugland, this autumn's surge in refugee numbers so overwhelmed Norway's Police Immigration Service (PU) that they could no longer properly vet asylum seekers, meaning as many as 13,000 of the new arrivals only received cursory checks.
PST has established a special unit to follow up some of the grim findings found on asylum seekers' phones and tablet computers.
According to the paper, these include:
Photos and videos of executions and brutal punishments, such as images of people holding severed heads or severed hands
Pictures of dead children, and other victims of war crimes
Flags and symbols linked to Isis, the al-Nusra Front or other terrorist groups.
Haugland stressed that the vast majority of asylum seekers coming to Norway did not pose a security risk and the fact that a person had these images or videos saved on their phone did not automatically prove that they had terrorist links.
“There may be several reasons why you have such images,” he said. “You might want to bear witness or have a desire to show what you've seen, or it might have been tactical to have symbols associated with the organisations that control the areas that you are passing through.
“What looks alarming might have other explanations apart from support for terrorist organisations.”
He said that of the hundreds of cases PST had handled only a handful of new arrivals still raised concerns after they had been investigated."

The PM's view is not shared by Finance Minister Siv Jensen, who is also leader of the anti-immigration Progress Party.
Just under a week ago, Solberg said that Norway could help relieve the burden on countries that have taken in a large number of refugees and migrants.
“If it is such that we reach agreement that the pressure of refugees coming to other countries in Europe is reduced because other countries take more, then we must agree on a distribution mechanism. I think that is fair and we also did that when we had redistribution in 2015,” she told NRK.
Following an EU summit attended by heads of state in Brussels last week, an agreement was made enabling countries that have taken in fewer refugees to relieve those that have taken in more.
But Finance Minister Jensen wrote on Facebook that she was not in support of the potential redistribution.
“In the last few days, many have asked whether Norway should voluntarily take in more migrants that come to EU countries.
“The Progress Party is against that. Norway has already contributed significantly. What we need is a joint asylum centre in Africa to keep the situation under control,” the minister wrote.
Meanwhile, Progress MP Per-Willy Amundsen suggested that his party should quit the coalition government should Solberg push to take in more refugees.
“I am sending a clear signal on behalf of the Progress Party parliamentary group that there is a limit to what Progress will accept. We are beginning to quickly approach that limit,” Amundsen told NRK.
Solberg's Conservative party colleague told NRK that he was unsurprised by the response from the Progress Party, saying that an anti-immigration stance was the “primary politics” of the populist parliamentary group.
“A potential migration agreement with the EU still lies some way ahead. But it is clear that it is in Norway's interest that Europe and the EU come to agreement on the issue (of migration). That would relieve pressure on the Norwegian asylum system,” he added.

“The migrants were gathered in front of the boat where they got water. They were afraid, but given the circumstances in good physical condition,” Terje Klevengen, the leader of the Norwegian mission said in a statement released by the Norwegian police.
“We see that there is an urgent need for us, and that both our vessels and our equipment is suitable for the waters in which we work,” Ronny Pedersen from the Norwegian Society for Sea Rescue, which supplied vessel, said.
Peter Henry von Koss is one of two vessels Norway has sent to take part in the rescue mission managed by Frontex, the European Union's border agency.
On Saturday, Siem Pilot, an 88-metre offshore supply vessel, brought 785 migrants to the Italian port of Palermo, after Italian coastguard vessels picked them up off the coast of Libya.
Members of the vessels crew gave teddy bears to the children on board.
“Some members of the crew spoke to their own kids at home to see what they can do to help the migrant children our ship would rescue. Together they decided to bring teddy bears. There's plenty of them in Norway and these kids need to feel like real children,” said Erling Olstad, commander of Siem Pilot.
Olstad and his crew have taken part in five search and rescue operations since Siem Pilot joined Operation Triton three weeks ago.
During one of the earlier rescues, the crew gave medical treatment to some 20 women who received chemical burns from a mixture of gasoline and seawater while they were sitting in their rubber dinghy in the hot sun.
Last week, more than 6 100 migrants were saved off the coast of Libya. Since the start of the year, some 81 500 migrants have been rescued in the Central Mediterranean, with one in four saved with the participation of vessels and aircraft deployed by Frontex."

Under the plan, asylum seekers whose case is viewed as “obviously groundless” could be jailed while their claim is fast-tracked under Norway's so-called '48-hour procedure'. That measure, put in place in January 2004, calls for migrants arriving from what the Norwegian Directorate of Immigration (UDI) to have their asylum applications processed and rejected within two days.
Integration Minister Sylvi Listhaug is now proposing that migrants would no legitimate asylum claim should be jailed while their cases are processed.
“We can see that unfounded asylum seekers disappear while the police are processing their applications. This will prohibit them from running off and eventually getting involved in criminal activity. Now we will now where we have them, get their applications processed and then return them,” Listhaug told broadcaster NRK.
Listhaug said that 90 of the 537 asylum seekers whose cases were processed under the 48-hour procedure in 2015 disappeared.
“Of those, we don't know where 90 percent of them are and thus we also haven't sent them out [of the country],” she said.
Listhaug's plan is backed by the Liberal Party (Venstre) and the Christian Democrats (Kristelig Folkeparti), assuring the government of a parliamentary majority.
The Norwegian Bar Association (Advokatforeningen) is among the critics of the plan, saying that it could scare off those who have legitimate asylum claims.
But Listhaug said that the Norwegian government is fully within its rights to temporarily jail migrants who clearly don't qualify for asylum.
“When you are a unfounded asylum seeker and come from a country that makes it obvious that you don't need protection, and you fall under the 48-hour procedure, then we think that there are plenty of reasons to give police this possibility,” she told NRK.
Under the proposal, asylum seekers can be imprisoned for up to 72 hours."

Just “a few details” and “approval” from authorities in Kabul appear to remain, news agency NTP reported Justice Minister Pål Lønseth saying. The discussion appears to have gone on for many months.
Sweden has led the talks embarked on by Britain, Denmark, Norway and The Netherlands. The stated aim is to send back kids whose application for asylum has failed because they have not demonstrated a need for “protection” against being sent back to war-torn Afghanistan.
New asylum centres in their home country would attempt to provide care, schooling and skills training, the state secretary said. It’s unclear whether the same western countries would have a say in the running and funding of the new centres.
The proposed move already has critics among organizations familiar with the reality of life for the youngsters if sent back. Among the plan’s critics is the Norwegian branch of non-governmental Save the Children, or Redd Barna.
“It seems odd to send kids and teenagers to a country which is so unstable,” Janne Oline Raanes of Redd Barna told The Local. She warns that children will likely spend little time in the planned “reception centres” before applying for asylum again.
“Norway isn’t taking responsibility for children on the run with this plan, and they’re operating in contravention of the United Nations’ recommendations,” Raanes said.
The Justice Ministry maintains each refugee’s security situation was being individually evaluated and none would be returned if it wasn’t deemed safe.
“It is not the case that refugee claimants can’t be returned to a place just because it isn’t as safe as Norway,” Lønseth said.
Young Afghan men and teenagers make up around half of the 717 juvenile asylum applications the Norwegian Foreign Ministry has received so far this year.
The ministry says it has always maintained that its policy has been to secure the safety of refugees as close to conflict areas as possible.
“Where this is not possible, Norway will contribute by taking in refugees and giving them residency protection here in this country,” the department’s website says."

The workers had distributed aid the insurgents allege is linked to Saudi Arabia.
In a statement, the NRC said authorities in the rebel-controlled Red Sea district of Hodeida detained three Yemeni staff and a contracted driver on Tuesday last week.
""Due to the security sensitivities regarding our staff, we cannot comment any further on the matter at this time,"" said the Oslo-based non-governmental organisation.
In a statement carried by Yemen's pro-government sabanew.net news website, Local Affairs Minister Abdul Raqib Fattah had said earlier a dozen staff had been ""abducted"" from the aid group's offices in the Hali district of Hodeida last week.
Local sources told AFP the employees were accused of having accepted and distributed aid from a Saudi-led coalition, which has been battling the Huthis since March 2015.
The NRC said it did not take funding from Saudi Arabia in any of its operations but had been using recycled boxes to distribute hygiene kits in Yemen.
The group said when staff had opened the boxes to distribute the aid, the inside read ""The campaign of the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques for emergency response,"" a reference to the Saudi king.
The boxes were dated January 2015 and had originally been used for food, according to the NRC.
Yemen's conflict pits a Saudi-led Arab coalition supportive of President Abedrabbo Mansour Hadi against Iran-backed Huthis, who currently control the port of Hodeida along with the capital Sanaa and large parts of northern Yemen.
Monday's news comes amid a push by forces loyal to Hadi, backed by the Arab coalition, to close in on Hodeida, located on Yemen's western coast.
The loyalist forces took full control of Mokha, south of Hodeida, earlier in February as part of a major offensive to oust the Huthis and their allies from Yemen's southwestern coast.
The conflict escalated in March 2015 when the Saudi-led coalition began air strikes to help pro-Hadi forces to take large parts of the country back from the rebels.
More than 7,400 people have been killed and nearly 40,000 wounded in two years of fighting in Yemen, according to the World Health Organisation.
UN humanitarian coordinator for Yemen James McGoldrick in January said more than 10,000 civilians had been killed since 2015."

UPDATE, Nov 30 at 8.17pm: The Norwegian Directorate of Immigration (UDI) announced via a press release on Monday afternoon that it is dropping its requirement that private organizations that house refugees be ""religion neutral"".
""We will not require that those who run overnight offers for us remove religious symbols after all,"" UDI wrote.
""The past days have seen a lot of questions regarding UDI's rules for running housing locations for asylum seekers and whether these places can have visible religious symbols, for example Christian or Muslim symbols. UDI wishes to stress that we do not know of any asylum seekers who have asked for the symbols to be removed.
ORIGINAL, Nov 30 at 2.27pm: The Norwegian Directorate of Immigration (UDI) has told facilities scheduled to receive asylum seekers to remove crosses, images of Jesus and other religious symbols, the Christian newspaper Dagen reported.
Several of the sites are Christian community centres and UDI's guideline stating that “rooms offered to asylum seekers must be religion-neutral” has not been greeted warmly by all.
While TV2 reported that several Christian organizations have agreed to remove crosses from their premises, one that will not be doing it is the Evidence of Faith (Troens Bevis) centre in Kvinesdal, which could host 1,000 refugees.
The group's leader, Rune Edvardsen, said that the centre's cross will remain.
“The hall was built by Christians who wanted to spread the word of God. To remove the cross from the hall would be like remove the rose from the Labour Party [Arbeiderpartiet]. It is a thought of no interest,” Edvardsen told Fædrelandsvennen newspaper.
Edvardsen wrote on Facebook that although he would not remove the cross, he would “lovingly […] help the refugees and aid the authorities' lack of space” should UDI request assistance. With room for 1,000 refugees, the Evidence of Faith facility could become one of the largest asylum centres in Norway, although no official decision has yet been made by UDI.
Other Christian groups have agreed to UDI's request.
“I don't think that Muslims care if there is a cross, but it is fine. We will remove it. I'm proud that we can accept refugees. We want to help. We are Christians and we will warmly welcome them,” Jelte Smith, who heads a Norwegian Mission Society (NMS) campground in southern Norway, told Fædrelandsvennen.
UDI has defended its guidelines by saying that they do not specifically target Christianity.
“It is important to specify that this applies to all religious symbols, not just the Christian ones,” press spokeswoman Vibeke Schjem told Dagen.
UDI's response has done little to squash the controversy, however.
In a sharply-worded editorial, Dagen's editor-in-chief said UDI's decision to ban the display of crosses in a country whose very flag contains the Christian symbol was an embarrassment that is being used on social media “as a prime example of the Norwegian authorities' genuflection to Islam”.
“Asylum seekers and migrants have no reservations in passing the Norwegian border despite the cross in our flag being one of the first things they see. They surely wouldn't be hurt by crosses in Christian centres either,” Vebjørn Selbekk wrote.
UDI's decision to house refugees in community centres comes as at least 30,000 people have sought asylum in Norway, a country of 5.2 million, since the beginning of the year."

“We must stick to current law and rulings on temporary residence for underage asylum seekers,” Labour spokesperson on immigration Helga Pedersen said, reports broadcaster NRK.
“It is the need for protection that must determine whether someone stays in Norway,” Pedersen continued.
Asylum policies must remain “strong and fair,” said Pedersen, while adding that minors granted temporary residence in asylum centres should be treated on different terms to adults.
Temporary asylum was increasingly granted to minors in Norway last year, due in part to an October 2016 law change that enabled asylum applications to be rejected if individuals could be returned to safe parts of their home countries, as reported by newspaper VG in December 2016.
Afghan nationals were the group primarily affected by the measure.
Minors not fulfilling requirements for asylum due to safety concerns in their home countries can be given temporary residency - usually in asylum centres - if ""strong humanitarian considerations"" deem this necessary, according to the VG report.
Progress Party's acting minister for immigration Per Sandberg praised the Labour position.
“It is important here to stand by the rules we have and I am glad that Labour is firm on this,” he said.
Labour's annual party conference begins tomorrow, with immigration set to be one of the key points of discussion.
Pedersen's stance is likely to meet with some opposition within the ranks of her own party, reports NRK.
A number of elements of the party want to cut down on granting temporary asylum to minors, instead giving permanent residence.
“We know about children harming themselves in asylum centres in Norway, about suicide attempts and children fleeing [from the asylum centres] within Norway. So policies must be changed,” Roger Valhammer, leader of the Bergen branch of the party, told NRK.

Valhammer said that he expected overall support for a change in party policy at the conference.
Potential Labour support for a softening of asylum rules was a “concern”, Sandberg said.
“Starting to loosen up now, giving asylum where protection is not required, would be completely wrong,” he said.
The government will “soon” present new measures for improving conditions for temporary and other asylum seekers in Norway's asylum centres, the minister told NRK.
“It will involve schemes and activities, regardless of whether you have been granted temporary asylum. This means both competency training and counselling in the centres,” Sandberg said.
But children's social services representative Anne Lindboe said that patching activities in asylum seekers was not a sustainable solution.
Granting temporary asylum should be reduced due to the effects of a lack of permanency and stability on the well-being of young, unaccompanied asylum seekers, Lindboe told NRK.
“I would again like to remind that we are talking about 15, 16 and 17-year-olds here. They are young people like our young people, that are in need of care,” she said.

					08:40 CET+01:00				", The Local,What can Scandinavia learn from Canada on immigration?,"What can Scandinavia learn from Canada when it comes to immigration and integration, asks Trygve Ugland of Bishop's University in this analysis first published by The Conversation.
As a wave of ""Scandimania"" sweeps the world, Canada is serving as an inspiration for Scandinavian countries dealing with the challenges of increased immigration and ethnic diversity.
Scandinavia has, for a long time, been portrayed as a model for other countries.
The international fascination with Scandinavia derives from a broadly shared impression that Denmark, Norway and Sweden have successfully combined private capitalism and economic growth, on the one hand, with state intervention and social equity on the other.
International observers have also noted that economic efficiency and social welfare in Scandinavia have reinforced each other. That's shown by consistently high rankings in international indices of competitiveness and happiness.
A few years ago, The Economist featured a bearded, horned-helmet-wearing Viking on its front cover, with the headline The Next Supermodel.
The overriding wisdom is that the world has a lot to learn from Scandinavia.
The Scandinavian model has also received substantial attention in Canada. Academics, journalists, politicians and leaders of non-governmental organizations alike continue to evoke Scandinavian solutions to Canadian and global challenges.
Canada no longer a 'policy borrower'?
Canada and the world have looked to Scandinavia on many issues. These include proportional representation, voter turnout, coalition governments, gender equality, education, environment and energy policy, welfare provisions and health-care delivery strategies – not to mention international humanitarianism and conflict resolution.
In contrast, Canada is usually described as a policy ""borrower.""
But in the area of immigration and integration policies, the relationship has turned on its head. Canada is the policy lender; Scandinavia the policy borrower.
As immigration novices, Denmark, Norway and Sweden have been searching for inspiration and new solutions abroad. And the Canadian immigration and integration policy model is attracting avid interest.
In fact, the Canadian model has played a significant role in the Scandinavian reform process since the early 2000s.
In particular, Canada's positive view of ""immigrants as a resource"" has served to inspire new attitudes towards labour immigration in Denmark, Norway and Sweden.
READ ALSO: How is Sweden tackling its integration challenge?
Canada's focus on skilled economic immigrants – a group that ostensibly integrates more easily in the labour market – has been held up as an alternative to humanitarian and family migrants. That phenomenon has contributed to a significant immigrant-native employment gap in Scandinavia.
However, the three Scandinavian countries haven't totally emulated the Canadian system.
Their immigration strategies, though focused on a Canada-style open and selective system, have differed from the original Canadian programs and policies. They've been adapted to domestic circumstances in a pragmatic fashion.
Still, the Canadian emphasis on immigrants' personal responsibility for integrating into the labour market – and society at large – has resonated in Denmark, Norway and Sweden.
As has a greater emphasis on so-called activation — the transfer of responsibility to social service users for their productive role in society.
Inspired by Canada
Norway's adoption of citizenship ceremonies and the Danish points system for economic immigrants were openly transferred from Canada. The Canadian model also played a role in the acceptance of dual citizenship in Sweden.
The Scandinavian fascination with the Canadian model persists, and last year I was invited to talk about Canada's Private Sponsorship of Refugees Program to a Swedish audience in Stockholm.
My upcoming book, Policy Learning from Canada, soon to be published by Toronto University Press, has also generated much interest in Scandinavia.
The relevance of the Canadian model for Scandinavia is intriguing for several reasons.
First, it demonstrates that the Canadian model, a product of unique socio-political and geographic circumstances – including Canada's size, long history of immigration and early adoption of multiculturalism as official policy – can still be relevant to other countries lacking these underlying conditions.
As latecomers to modern immigration, the Scandinavian countries are clearly different from Canada. Still, the Canadian model is relevant for other countries lacking its unique circumstances, just as it is for Scandinavia.
Promotes Canada's image abroad
What's more, Canada's status as an international immigration model in Scandinavia shows that a country typically described in public policy literature as a ""policy borrower"" can become a ""policy lender"" for those that have traditionally served as policy exporters.
This challenges much of the established knowledge in the field. And it suggests that the active promotion of the Canadian model by successive federal governments in Ottawa has succeeded.
Indeed, Canada's international leadership role in immigration and integration policy is an effective way of promoting Canadian interests and values internationally, a central priority of Canadian foreign policy.
The Canadian model's future relevance for Scandinavia and elsewhere will largely be dependent on its pragmatic adaptation to changing circumstances, while producing benefits for both Canada and its immigrants.

“Although the number of asylum seekers arriving has been low throughout the year, there is still great uncertainty about the number of people who want to seek residence in Norway. Therefore it is important for the government to maintain the temporary border controls,” ministry spokesman Ove Andre Vanebo said.
Norway’s border control measures were introduced in November 2015 and have since been extended several times. The most six-month extension was was due to expire on Saturday.
In addition to Norway, Denmark, Sweden, Germany and Austria have all introduced temporary controls in the wake of last year’s refugee crisis.
The European Commission has given all five countries approval to extend the measures for another three months. The commission requires regular reports from Norway about the results of its border controls.
The latest report was submitted on October 17th and showed that a total of 53 people had been refused entry into Norway since the measures were introduced. Additionally, a total of 30 people applied for asylum upon arrival.
EU wants free movement within the Schengen area and therefore wants countries to do away with the controls, but has accept that they continue until further notice because Greece has not yet fully control the union’s outer borders."

A total of 435 000 asylum applicants were registered in the European Union, Switzerland and Norway in 2013, up from 333,000 in 2012. Syria supplied the most refugees with 50,000 applications."
