					13:43 CET+01:00				",The Local,Asylum seeker arrivals in Norway 'lowest since 1997',"3,051 people – the lowest number since 1997 – applied for asylum in Norway in 2016, according to Directorate of Immigration figures.
Norway’s Directorate of Immigration (Utlendingsdirektoratet, UDI) has also estimated that around 7,000 asylum seekers per year will arrive in Norway in 2017 and 2018.
The agency pointed out that the prognosis is tentative, however.
“The prognosis was completed in February 2017 and the assessments within it are based on developments up to the beginning of February 2017 with the information available at that time,” UDI told broadcaster NRK.
3,460 people applied for asylum in Norway in 2016, according figures provided by UDI to NRK.
The figure represents the lowest total since 1997.
“Our assessment is that border and ID checks in Europe have had a decisive effect on numbers of arrivals in Norway,” UDI wrote.
The low numbers have continued into 2017, reports NRK, with 858 asylum seekers arriving in Norway so far this year.
Of these, 574 came to Norway in accordance with the country’s voluntary participation in the EU’s relocation scheme.
Norway has agreed to take in 1,500 asylum seekers from Greece and Italy during 2016 and 2017 – a quota the UDI expects to have fulfilled by the summer.
The agency also expects to receive 750 unaccompanied minors in 2017, although only 45 have arrived so far.
“The potential for migration is large, and there is no information that suggests that there has been a reduction in motivation for potential asylum seekers to migrate. We therefore assume that the number of migrants trying to reach Europe is as high as before,” UDI wrote to the broadcaster.
The estimation depends on a number of factors, such as the continuation of the current agreement between the EU and Turkey, and asylum seekers arriving in Greece remaining low in number.
Further factors are the continued implementation of border controls in the Balkan countries as well as within the Schengen zone."

					09:38 CET+01:00				",AFP,Norway to turn back asylum seekers at border,"Norway said Tuesday it would start turning back refugees without visas arriving from elsewhere in the passport-free Schengen zone, particularly Sweden.
The move is part of a draft law containing a series of immigration measures that the Oslo government says will make its asylum policy ""one of Europe's toughest"".
The conservative minority last month gathered enough parliamentary support from the centre and labour parties to adopt the measures.
Norway does not belong to the EU but it is, like Sweden, a member of the Schengen area which has no passport or immigration controls.
According to Schengen rules, asylum seekers must apply for a visa in the country they first arrive in, mostly Italy and Greece. But many instead move on to the country they want to eventually settle in, often in Europe's richer north.
Most of the 30,000 people asking for asylum in Norway this year have crossed the border from Sweden.
Critics say the Norwegian move would place undue pressure on the southern European arrival countries.
""Norway is choosing an isolated policy, by refusing to see that if every country in the Schengen area blocked refugees the same way, they would all get stuck in Greece and Italy,"" Pal Nesse, senior advisor for the Norwegian Refugee Council, told AFP. But Norway's Immigration Minister Sylvi Listhaug said the new law would actually improve the lives of legal immigrants.
""We will have an asylum policy that will be among the toughest in Europe,""she told the NTB news agency. ""And that is completely necessary so that we can welcome those who come here, settle them in and integrate them.""
The new law also calls for welfare payments for asylum seekers to be below those for Norwegian residents in order to make the country less attractive; the expulsion of unsuccessful applicants; restrictions on long-term residency permits and tougher rules on family members joining successful asylum applicants."

UDI will offer an additional 10,000 kroner to the first 500 asylum seekers who apply for a voluntary return to their home countries. Beginning on Monday, the offer will run for six weeks on a first-come, first-served basis.
“We need to entice more to voluntarily travel back by giving them a bit more money on their way out. This will save us a lot of money because it is expensive to have people in the asylum centres,” Integration Minister Sylvi Listhaug told broadcaster NRK.
The offer entails giving asylum seekers an additional 10,000 kroner in travel expenses on top of the 20,000 kroner already offered.

UDI reported in December that an increasing number of asylum seekers are interested in taking Norway up on its offer to fund a return trip home due to long family reunification waiting times and barriers to taking work or starting an education.
According to UDI, a family with two children can receive upwards of 80,000 kroner ($9,300 or 8,600 euros) in addition to the travel expense coverage.
To qualify for the additional 10,000 kroner to cover travel costs, asylum seekers must have arrived in Norway prior to April 1st and must not have overstayed their legal length of stay.
UDI said the goal of the bonus was to stimulate a faster voluntary return of those asylum seekers who do not have a legitimate protection claim in Norway. The bonus scheme will be marketed via displays and posters in 31 municipalities."

					10:36 CET+01:00				",The Local,Asylum seekers want to leave – if Norway pays,"An increasing number of asylum seekers are interested in taking Norway up on its offer to fund a return trip home.
Long family reunification waiting times and barriers to taking work or starting an education are leading more and more asylum seekers to express an interest in leaving Norway.
“They thought that when they came to Norway they would get protection rather quickly. And that they would have the opportunity to work or take an education – and maybe even to get their family to Norway,” Katinka Hartmann, head of the The Norwegian Directorate of Immigration's (Utlendingsdirektoratet - UDI) return unit, told broadcaster NRK.
But with family reunification application processing times taking years, many have decided that they don't want to wait and have applied for financial assistance to return home.
According to UDI, over 900 people have applied to leave Norway with financial support from the state. A family with two children can receive upwards of 80,000 kroner ($9,300 or 8,600 euros) in addition to having their airline tickets bought by the state.
The number of applications is on the rise, according to the Norwegian division of the International Organization for Migration (IOM), which processes the requests.
“Earlier this year, the number was an average of 100 per month. In October, there were 150 and in November there were 230 applications,” IOM spokesman Joost van der Aalst told NRK.
He said that the long family reunification times were a major factor, but many people were also put off by having to live in remote areas where they feel it is difficult to put their work experience to use.
UDI's Hartmann said that it could be necessary to reduce the amount of financial support offered to returning asylum seekers.
“It could be appropriate to cut funding for some groups and it could also be appropriate to temporarily offer more in support to other groups,” she said.
People whose asylum applications have been denied can also apply for economic assistance to return home."

31,145 people applied for asylum in Norway last year, nearly 20,000 more than in 2014. This year, the Norwegian Directorate of Immigration (UDI) thinks the number will reach 50,000 to 60,000.
More than half of last year's asylum applications came in October and November, UDI head Frode Forfang said.
“That sums up some of our challenges. The wave we had in the autumn was extremely high,” he said.
Unaccompanied minors
Forfang also mentioned the challenge of dealing with the many unaccompanied minor asylum seekers, who accounted for around one sixth of all applicants in 2015.
“Growth there was stronger than the overall growth,” he said.
Most asylum seekers in 2015 came from Syria, with the 10,536 applicants constituted more than a four-fold increase over 2014. Next came people from Afghanistan (6,987), Iraq (2,991), Eritrea (2,947) and Iran (1,342).
For Afghanistan, Iraq and Iran, the number of applicants increased by ten to 15 times from 2014 levels.
Downward revisions
UDI has previously estimated that as many as 100,000 asylum seekers might come to Norway in 2016. This figure has now been revised downward, with UDI expecting anywhere between 10,000 and 60,000 asylum seekers. Forfang emphasized that there is considerable uncertainty in the calculations.
Some 24,000 people are currently waiting to have their asylum applications processed.
“This is a very large number. Our capacity is nowhere near what is needed,” the UDI head said.
Over the coming months, the agency will add around 200 new caseworkers but even with that Forfang said that UDI would be understaffed."

The proposal by the nationalist Progress Party (Fremskrittspartiet, Frp) had no support from other parliamentary parties, Solberg said.
“Frp has always been of the opinion that people whose asylum applications are rejected should be held in secured facilities. They have not received backing for that, and we agree with this [the lack of backing, ed.],” the PM told NRK.
“This is an old Frp proposal that I heard Sylvi [Listhaug, minister for immigration and Frp MP, ed.] repeat yesterday, but it is not a foundation for this government and is not going to become one,” Solberg continued.
The PM said that detaining rejected asylum seekers was “not government policy”.

Listhaug came in for criticism after she said on Thursday that asylum seekers arriving in Norway without definitive identification or papers should be held in secured facilities until their identity could be confirmed.
Asylum seekers whose applications are rejected but do not leave Norway of their own free will should also be detained, she said.
International human rights conventions should not be allowed to take precedence over the necessity of the measure, Listhaug told NRK.
But Solberg dismissed the notion that human rights conventions could be renegotiated following the September 11th election.
“We must use secured facilities more, but we will not broaden the scope of who can be detained in them,” she told NRK.
“Frp has always said this. That they are saying it again during the election campaign cannot come as a surprise to anyone. But it is not the policy of the other conservative parties,” she added.
“We believe that it is possible to ensure the security of Norwegians, fight terror and have a responsible immigration policy within the parameters of the human rights conventions,” Solberg said.

					14:49 CEST+02:00				",Emma Anderson ,Norway sees Ukrainian asylum seeker boom,"Norway saw a huge spike in Ukrainians applying for asylum in 2014, according to data released by Eurostat this month and analyzed by The Local.
Five times as many Ukrainians applied for asylum in the country in 2014 compared to 2013, with 130 applicants last year compared to just 25 in 2013.
The rise was part of a leap in asylum applications from Ukraine seen across the 28 EU member states, with the total number of Ukrainian asylum seekers ballooning to 14,040 people in 2014, more than 13 times higher than the 1,060 who applied in 2013.
The number is even greater when compared to 2008, the beginning of the global economic crisis, when just 925 Ukrainians applied for asylum.
“What we have seen from our members working with asylum seekers are those who are fleeing the conflict in the east of Ukraine,” Julia Zelvenska, a senior legal officer at the European Council on Refugees and Exiles, told The Local. “In the past, it has been for political persecution, like in 2013, or for sexual orientation.”
The UN refugee agency UNHCR said last month that an estimated one million Ukrainians were displaced internally, with many people moving west. Some 600,000 people had sought asylum, many of them in non-EU countries such as Russia, Belarus and Moldova.
But many Ukrainians also applied for asylum in the European Union in 2014, a year that started with a revolution in Kiev and the ousting of the pro-Russian president, Viktor Yanukovych.
Russia then annexed Crimea in March, in a move widely condemned around the world, before propping up separatists fighting bloody battles with Ukrainian forces in the east of the country.
Of those who applied for asylum in 2014, 650 Ukrainians received positive outcomes on their first application decision in the EU. Eurostat defines positive outcomes as grants of refugee or subsidiary protection status, or an authorisation to stay for humanitarian reasons.
Still, those who received good news were greatly outnumbered by those who were rejected in their first try - 2,335.
Norway rejected 75 Ukrainian asylum applicants in their first attempt, and had not accepted any applicants in 2014, according to Eurostat data.
Zelvenska explained to The Local that it is generally very hard for Ukrainians to gain asylum in EU member states, or to even reach those countries in the first place.
“One of the main reasons people get rejected may be that many countries are not clear on how the situation developed and won’t issue decisions until it is clear how the Ukrainian situation is going to develop,” she said.
“European countries are also being very formalistic in the criteria for asylum,” Zelvenska added. “For example, they may say that there are options for alternative protection already within Ukraine. For people in the east, they may say that they could relocate to the west.”
Zelvenska noted though that reasons for rejection are not made public so it is difficult to know for certain.
“We think it’s not necessary to apply all the criteria in a strict manner,” she said. “They must consider each case, country and the circumstances.”
Last year, EU countries received the highest number of asylum seekers since 1992 with a total of 626,000 applicants. More than 400,000 people applied in 2013.
Ukrainian asylum seekers generally made Germany their first port of call, with the country receiving 2,705 requests according to Eurostat, 18 times more than in 2013.
Of the Ukrainians who applied, Germany accepted 20 in the first instance, but rejected another 45.
Italy accepted the highest number of Ukrainian applicants compared to all other EU countries, with 165 applicants receiving positive outcomes, followed by the Czech Republic (150) and Finland (145)."

Of the 61 married minors who sought asylum in Norway in 2015, at least ten were under the country's sexual age of consent of 16, broadcaster NRK reported based on figures from the Norwegian Immigration Directorate (UDI) and the Norwegian Directorate for Children, Youth and Family Affairs (Bufdir).
At least ten of the girls were under the age of 16, while 49 girls and two boys who are married were 16 or 17 when they arrived in Norway. At least two of the girls under the age of 18 were expecting their second child.
The youngest married asylum seeker was just 11 years old when she arrived in Norway.
Most of the married minors came from Syria, Afghanistan or Iraq.
“We are looking very seriously at children under 18 who are in danger of being subjected to sexual abuse, violence and forced actions. We are committed to helping these children and to preventing forced situations. These could be criminal cases,” Bufdir director Mari Trommald told NRK.
A 14-year-old pregnant girl crossed the Storskog border station in November with her 23-year-old husband and their 18-month-old child. Today, the two live separately and the 23-year-old is under police investigation.
Trommald said that each case must be assessed individually to determine whether the married couples should live separately.
“The age of sexual consent in Norway is 16 and that will often guide how one views these matters. However, other problematic situations like violence and coercion will also be included in the assessments,” she said."

""If we compare with people of the same age and sex, most of the over-representation disappears,"" the researchers said. The report, conducted by Oxford Research on the UDI's behalf, shows that 1 in 50 cases of crime committed in 2010 involved an asylum seeker or person living in Norway without papers.

Acceptance of the proposal means that all cases of unaccompanied minors decided since October 1st 2016 will now be reassessed, including the so-called “October children” from Afghanistan who arrived in 2015 and had been slated for deportation due to reaching the age of 18.
Immigration minister Sylvi Listhaug reacted with scepticism after the government lost the parliamentary vote requiring reassessment of the cases of unaccompanied minors, reports NRK.
Asylum seekers whose cases are to be reassessed will not be deported until new decisions over their applications are reached.
Listhaug was critical of the outcome of the parliamentary vote.
“I have to say that I am surprised at the way parliament dealt with a complex issue like this,” she told NRK.
“Today parliament has made a decision on an issue [the rule change, ed.] that has not been through thorough assessment in the [immigration] Ministry, nor in the parliamentary committee. That is in spite of the fact that the issue has been discussed over a long period of time and that a proposal has already been submitted to the committee,” she said.
The Labour proposal relates to a change in rules relating to under-age asylum seekers that arrive in Norway unaccompanied and are given so-called temporary residence (midlertidig opphold).
The proposal changes the way in which young asylum seekers’ cases are assessed, putting more emphasis on ‘vulnerability’ (sårbarhet).
This particularly affects the cases of those who would be returned to a different region of a country to where they are from – effectively deporting them to internal displacement, NRK reported on Monday night.
Labour has previously stated its opposition to a proposal by other parties to freeze all deportations to Afghanistan.
The reassessments must be carried out individually and will not necessarily result in all being granted asylum, according to the NRK's report.
Labour deputy leader Trond Giske told the broadcaster that around 200 to 300 people would have their cases reviewed as a result of the parliamentary vote, but that the number who would see a reversal of their decision depends on the assessment of the Norwegian Directorate of Immigration (UDI).

The decision is likely to affect several hundred under-age asylum seekers, reports NRK.
UDI did not name all the centres to be closed, but did say that some centres for unaccompanied minors would be included.
“The basis for this is that UDI has far too much available capacity. This is a result of 31,000 asylum seekers coming [to Norway] in 2015, compared to just 3,460 last year. That is a reduction of over 27,000 asylum seekers,” UDI's regional director Stig Arne Thune told NRK.
The closures encompass 1,610 places at asylum centres, of which 320 are earmarked for unaccompanied minors arriving in the country, according to the report.
“If arrivals in Norway remain low, I wouldn't rule out further reductions,” Thune said.
Norsk Mottaksdrift, a company that has run several asylum centres under the auspices of UDI, will now close its last remaining centre, in the town of Skei, under orders from UDI.
The company's owner Per Erik Lykstad told NRK that, although reaction amongst his employees had been varied, the news had not come as a surprise.
“I understand that UDI must downsize when there are fewer asylum seekers. But it will be a challenge if there is an increase in numbers of asylum seekers in future. We will be less well-prepared,” he said.
Lykstad said the announcement was difficult to take for a number of reasons.
“This is special for us as a company, because Skei is the last centre we are operating. This type of business is now over for us. In 2016 we had around 300 employees at our centres, by December we'll have none,” he said.

But she beleives many asylum seekers leave Norway because the picture they had of the country beforehand did not match up with reality.
“We assume that many of them had an unrealistic and erroneous perception of the types of opportunities they would have in Norway. Probably those who do not have a need for protection release that there is little to gain in having their asylum applications processed here,” she told Vårt Land.

Both the Christian Democrats and the Liberal Party are pushing for the amnesty as part of coalition talks with the Conservative Party over forming the new government.

					16:52 CEST+02:00				",The Local,Norway proposes jailing fake asylum seekers,"Norway's justice minister has announced plans to jail asylum seekers if they do not have a good enough reason to seek refuge in Norway.
Anders Anundsen, a senior member of the anti-immigration Progress Party, said that a three-day spell in prison would send “an important signal” to would-be immigrants abusing the asylum system to gain entry to Norway.
“What we are sending out for consultation now is a proposal that the cases of asylum seekers who deliver manifestly unfounded asylum applications can be processed with an expeditious procedure lasting two days, and that they also be detained pending proceedings,” Anundsen told Norway's state broadcaster NRK.
The new proposal, which was sent out for consultation on Friday, proposes jailing those whose asylum applications are obviously unjustified for up to 72 hours.
“As we have it today, people come into the country and then disappear straight away,” he said. “By the time their asylum applications are rejected, you can no longer find these individuals.”
The Norwegian Organisation for Asylum Seekers (NOAS) condemned the proposal.
“You cannot imprison someone just because they want a better future in Norway,” Andreas Furuseth, the group's legal advisor, told NRK. “To imprison someone is a highly intrusive measure, and such measures must be used with caution.”
Anundsen said that with Norwegian prisons facing a serious shortage of capacity, it might be necessary for the asylum seekers to be housed in Norway's Trandum Immigration Detention Centre rather than in a standard prison."

The opposition Labour Party has questioned the legality of the proposals, writes news agency NTB.
Listhaug’s proposal constitutes housing all newly-arrived asylum seekers in a single accommodation facility, according to a report by the Aftenposten newspaper.
Eight of ten asylum seekers will have their cases resolved while still housed at the facility, should the idea become reality.
The aim would be to accommodate all asylum seekers at a centre in Østfold County in a building formerly known as Smart Club, which was converted to an asylum centre in 2015.
Eight out of ten asylum applications for people living at the centre would be processed within three weeks of their arrival, according to the proposal, which is based upon what Norway’s Directorate of Immigration (Utlendingsdirektoratet, UDI) considers a realistic target, according to the report.
The Østfold centre would have a capacity of 1,000, with facilities covering the needs of residents for the short periods they would be expected to stay there.
Listhaug told Aftenposten that the restructuring of asylum accommodation and processing would have significant benefits.
“Reduced centre costs, better quality application processing, faster return [deportation of rejected applicants, ed.] and not least faster settlement and integration,” Listhaug told Aftenposten.
“Those who are rejected will be immediately deported from the country, ideally directly from the asylum centre. Those who are granted asylum will go straight into an integration programme, potentially directly to a municipality for relocation,” the minister added.
Norway’s opposition Labour Party said that it supported a number of the stated goals of the proposal but was uncertain with regard to whether it respected rule of law.
“We can support several of the intentions, such as efficient application processing of asylum seekers, fast integration and fast relocation,” Labour’s spokesperson for immigration Stein Erik Lauvås told NTB.
“But we have a number of questions, including regarding legal rights of asylum seekers. How will these be respected?”, Lauvås said.
Listhaug must also explain how a capacity of 1,000 can be achieved at the Østfold centre, the spokesperson added.
“That is a lot of people. The centre at Østfold is big, but not that big,” he said.
Labour will present Listhaug with its questions should she choose to bring the proposal before parliament, Lauvås told NTB.

“As long as redistribution in Europe doesn't work, there are just a few countries that are very attractive [destinations for refugees, ed.]. Norway is one of them,” Listhaug said.
European countries have recently been under fire for what critics say is a race to the bottom to establish the strictest national asylum policies.
But Listhaug said that with several Eastern European countries having agreed to accept refugees, the fact that the refugees don't accept the offer is proof that for many asylum seekers are comparing the conditions of the host countries rather than settling for a place where they will be safe.
“It has developed into a form of asylum shopping, where the refugees themselves want to choose which country they can come to that has good welfare conditions and democracy,” she said.
Asylum restrictions over Easter
Asylum and immigration policy was on the agenda when Listhaug on Friday met with the Council of Europe's secretary general, Thorbjørn Jagland.
Jagland has criticized several of Listhaug's proposed asylum changes, saying that her plans to make family reunification requirements more stringent, provide only temporary residency for minors and turn away asylum seekers at the border would violate Norway's international conventions.
Listhaug said only that she “noted” his input and will continue to get the asylum package finalized over the Easter holiday. She said that a “sustainable immigration” policy is the government's top priority and insisted that the proposals would be within the framework of international conventions signed by Norway.
“It's important for us to remain within the conventions that we have committed ourselves to following and we will ensure that we do that when we present the proposal to parliament,” she said.
Jagland has previously criticized several EU countries for the measures they have taken to slow the influx of refugees, including the closure of borders and returning asylum seekers without due process.
He warned that the Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg has a clear line when it comes to family reunification and “one should not come in conflict with it”.
Listhaug's asylum package calls for refugees to have held a job or been in education for four years before they can bring their family members to Norway. That goes even further than the country's southern neighbour Denmark, which has been heavily criticized for making refugees wait three years to be reunited with their families.
Jagland, a former Norwegian minister of foreign affairs, was in Norway on Friday for his first official visit as secretary general. He was also due to meet with Prime Minister Erna Solberg and Justice Minister Anders Anundsen."

The institution’s contract with the foreign ministry expires at the end of this month, but after the Norwegian Medical Association in December ruled the practice as unethical, the university has now decided against extending the collaboration.
“As a professional, I feel that – in line with the medical association –it is highly reprehensible and unethical to practice methods which, to such a large extent, are weak and deviate so much in their standards. This is especially important seeing the consequences are so great for those who are subject to these examinations,” Norwegian Pediatrician Ellen Annexstad was cited by news agency NTB as saying.
Norway has applied the age assessments practices for unaccompanied minors since 2005 after authorities discovered that a number of adult refugees had lied about their age to increase their chances of receiving asylum.
According to NTB, test results show that some 40 percent of asylum seekers who last year underwent the age assessment process were believed to be 20 years or older.
The number of minors seeking asylum in Norway has decreased drastically in the past 12 months, falling from 5,500 in 2015, to just 320 in 2016. The largest group of asylum-seeking minors, representing about a third of the total, were from Afghanistan."

Minister of Migration and Integration Sylvi Listhaug presented 40 new restrictions to the country's immigration rules on Tuesday.
The planned changes are based on an agreement reached by parliament in November to reduce numbers of refugees reaching the Scandinavian nation. A total of 35,358 asylum seekers arrived in Norway in this year, compared with 11,480 in 2014.
A continued increase in asylum seekers could have “devastating consequences” for Norwegian society, according to Listhaug, who is a member of the anti-immigration Progress Party (Fremskrittspartiet).
The proposals include tighter rules on family reunification and a minimum period of five years before permanent residence is granted, an increase from the previous three years. Underage asylum seekers under 18 will also have their cases reassessed when they turn 18, and the bar for refugees' language and cultural understanding requirements will be set higher.
Police will deport rejected asylum seekers more quickly and the right to appeal will be restricted.
The Norwegian government has also announced that it wants to turn away refugees crossing the border from Sweden.
“This will provide motivation to make an effort to learn Norwegian and find work for those who want to be here,” said Listhaug at a press conference on Tuesday.
But the proposals have met with criticism from politicians from the government coalition's supporting parties, who voted for the move towards stricter asylum rules in November.
“The aim of the asylum agreement was to prevent unjustified asylum seekers from straining the overloaded system, because that is bad for those who need protection. But Listhaug's proposals are problematic and will leave men, women and children who have left their homes and have real need for protection without the help they need,” MP André Skjelstad of the Liberal (Venstre) party said to NRK.
“We support [efforts to stop unnecessary asylum], but there is a good deal missing and we are critical and have concerns about the integration aspect [of the proposal], Geir Sigbjørn Toskedal of the Christian People's Party told NRK.
Skjelstad also raised concerns about the effects of the new measures on integration.
“Listhaug is not using the right methods. She ought to be making sure that we enable more people to be active earlier than we do currently, by allowing them to work with and without pay. We know that this works,” Skjelstad said.
The Norwegian Association for Asylum Seekers (NOAS) was strongly critical of the proposals, suggesting they may break international law.
“At worst, this is a break with international law and will force people to travel home and be subjected to the dangers that [international] resolutions are supposed to protect them from,” Senior Legal Adviser with NOAS, Andreas Furuseth, was quoted as saying by NRK.
The proposals will undergo a six-week “hearing” period, during which time they are available to the public, before being negotiated and finalized in parliament."

					13:04 CEST+02:00				", The Local,Danish parties ‘envious' of Norway's tough asylum bill,"While the long-discussed asylum and immigration bill presented by the Norwegian government on Tuesday has been criticized by opposition parties and human rights organizations, the package of initiatives is certainly not without its admirers.
Least of all in Denmark, where Norway's southern neighbour has also introduced a long line of initiatives meant to discourage would-be asylum seekers.
Following the presentation of Norway's bill on Tuesday, several Danish parties that support the current Venstre minority government said Denmark should adopt some of the Norwegian approach.
Of particular interest to the Danish parties is a provision in the Norwegian bill allowing Norway to deny entry to all asylum seekers who do not come directly from countries in conflict in emergency situations.
The provision would only be implemented if the Norwegian government concludes that the European response to a new large influx of refugees “does not work”. PM Erna Solberg also previously said that the legislation could be implemented “in the event that it all breaks down”, pointing specifically to the strain on neighbouring Sweden, which took in 163,000 asylum seekers in 2015 and expects an additional 100,000 this year.
Under the emergency provision, asylum seekers entering from Russia or other Nordic countries would be immediately rejected at the border if they are not coming directly from areas of conflict.
The anti-immigration Danish People's Party (DF) proposed last month that Denmark implement a similar plan to turn people away at the border if it can be proven that they came from a safe country.
Following Tuesday's presentation of the Norwegian bill, the party once again called on Danish Integration Minister Inger Støjberg to pursue a similar measure.
“That the Norwegians are taking this step is completely understandable. Many of the asylum seekers who come to the Nordics have been in other countries, including the Nordic countries,” DF spokesman Peter Skaarup told Politiken.
“Just as they [the Norwegians] have a challenge in relation to the other Nordic countries, we have a challenge in relation to Germany, which we also consider to be a safe country,” he added.
Simon Emil Ammitzbøll, a spokesman for government support party Liberal Alliance, said it was “completely unbelievable” that Denmark hasn't stopped people arriving from safe countries from seeking asylum.
“We can look enviously to Norway and I can't see a single reason for why we shouldn't do the same,” he told Politiken.
As is the case in Norway itself, opinions of the country's hardline approach are split.
Danish opposition party the Social Liberals (Radikale) slammed the Norwegian asylum approach.
“It's a crazy proposal. The Norwegian government is challenging basic human rights and is actually saying that there are situations in which they don't apply,” party spokeswoman Sofie Carsten Nielsen told Politken.
The Norwegian asylum package was presented to parliament on Tuesday and will go to an open hearing on April 28th.
On Friday, Norwegian Integration Minister Sylvi Listhaug will visit her Danish counterpart Støjberg in Copenhagen but the latter declined to comment on whether Denmark had plans to copy the Norwegian provision."

“If the war in Syria ends, or conditions in Iraq improve, they will have to prepare for the return trip,” State Secretary Joran Kallemyr, a senior official from the Progress Party in the Ministry of Justice told Norway’s state broadcaster NRK on Thursday evening.
“If there are changes in the country that means you no longer need protection in Norway, you should basically be returned.”
Kallemyr said the government had put the policy out for consultation, and hoped to get it through parliament before Christmas.
He said the policy would also apply to families.
“If anyone gets a family reunion and the asylum applicant who is the reference person can no longer stay in Norway, the whole family will return,” he said.
“What we are obligated to do under international law is to not prevent families being together, but we are not obliged to arrange for the family to come to Norway.”
He said that, unlike Sweden, Norway had already stopped paying the flights and other expenses of those coming to Norway for family reunion.
Kallemyr said that in bringing in temporary asylum, Sweden was following in the footsteps of Germany, which has brought in three year temporary asylum for Syrian fleeing the civil war.

					12:12 CEST+02:00				",NTB/The Local,Progress Party to asylum seekers: Act Norwegian,"Norway's right-wing populist Progress Party wants asylum seekers to show they're serious about fitting in before they can be granted permanent residency.
Seemingly irked by immigrants who fail to integrate, the party is calling on would-be residents to dress like Norwegians, speak Norwegian, get jobs, respect Norwegian culture and values, adhere to the proper use of welfare benefits, and generally behave impeccably, newspaper Dagbladet reports.
“It’s a fact that many asylum seekers don’t want to be part of Norwegian society,” said immigration policy spokesman Morten Ørsal Johansen.
“Those who don’t wish to work and don’t learn Norwegian shouldn’t be given permanent residency.”
The new policies drawn up by Johansen, along with colleagues Gjermund Hagesæter and Åge Starheim, enjoy the full support of the party leadership, the newspaper said.
According to Johansen, it’s important to place demands on immigrants wishing to remain in the country.
“To take an example: a woman who declines to take a job because she can’t wear a burqa should have to face the consequences. People who don’t want to work shouldn’t get permanent residence permits,” he said.
Anyone applying to stay in Norway on a permanent basis – the last step before full citizenship – should also have to take a test to prove their knowledge of Norwegian language and society, Johansen believes.
The proposals were quickly slammed by Inga Marte Thorkildsen (Socialist Left), Minister of Children, Equality and Social Inclusion, who accused the Progress Party of exaggerating problems associated with integration.
“I’ve hardly even heard of a woman being denied a job because she demands to wear a burqa to work,” said Thorkildsen.
“One major equality problem that does exist however is that of women not joining the labour market because they have long been isolated in the home with Progress Party-supported cash incentives. And a recent study shows that job seekers with a foreign name have a 25-percent lower chance of getting work with Norwegian employers,” the minister added.
The Labour Party’s Lise Christoffersen meanwhile categorized the proposals as the latest in a series of frivolous initiatives from the Progress Party.
The Conservative and Liberal parties, the Progress Party's opposition partners, were similarly unimpressed.
""Either you're granted asylum or you're not granted asylum. And if you have the right to protection in Norway, government authorities should not use the asylum institution as a bargaining chip for a desired lifestyle,"" Conservative Party immigration policy spokesman Trond Helleland told news agency NTB.
Liberal Party deputy chief Terje Breivik was equally blunt.
""We totally disagree with these demands. In this regard, the Liberals represent a clear alternative to both the government and the Progress Party,"" he said.
The Progress Party scored 22.9 percent of the vote in the 2009 general election, earning it 41 seats in parliament.
Progress Party residency proposals in brief:
- Anyone applying for permanent residency must have lived in Norway for the previous six years, as opposed to the current three-year limit.
- A jail-term of at least one year should lead to reduced residency rights. Minor transgressions should lead to a lengthening of the minimum application deadline.
- All money owed to the state or municipalities must be repaid.
- Applicants must have worked full time for at least two-and-a-half of the previous three years and may not have received any social welfare benefits in that period.
- Applicants should be required to sign a declaration of integration and citizenship.
- Applicants must have passed a Norwegian 2 language test, or equivalent.
- Applicants who have participated in voluntary work or other activities that display an active interest in Norwegian life should have this taken into account when applying for residency.
- A reward system should be put in place to set a high standard for the integration of foreign citizens.
- Family reunification should require compliance with the terms and conditions required for the granting of permanent residence permits.
- People coming to Norway through family reunification programmes should not have the right to bring along further family members."

Although that number set an all-time record, it was lower than the goal the government had set at the outset of the year.
According to a report from broadcaster NRK in the waning days of 2016, police nationwide were planning to make an extra effort in the final days of December to hit the government's goal of 9,000 deportations.
While the target wasn't met, Immigration Minister Sylvi Listhaug said she was still satisfied with the record number of deportations.
“It's about fighting crime and securing the population. We will find those who are staying illegally in Norway and we will send them back to the country they belong to,” she told NRK.
The 8,078 people who were deported last year represented a roughly two percent increase over 2015 figures.
PU head Morten Hojem Ervik said that part of the reason the agency didn't hit its target is that the significantly lower number of asylum seekers mean that there were simply fewer people to deport.
Through a number of restrictions, Norway's 2016 asylum numbers were the country's lowest in 19 years.
Roughly 28 percent of those who were deported in 2016 had criminal records, a slight decrease from the percentage in the previous year."

Since the beginning of the year, 29,000 people have sought asylum in the country of 5.2 million, including 2,500 people in the past week alone.
The ruling parties, the Conservatives and the anti-immigration populist Progress Party, reached an agreement with their centrist allies and the Labour opposition, giving them a broad parliamentary majority to limit the number of refugees coming to the Scandinavian country.
Under the deal, the government will reduce asylum seekers' social benefits, putting them on a par with levels in neighbouring Nordic countries to make Norway less attractive, and speed up the processing of some cases and the expulsion of rejected asylum seekers.
It will also limit access to permanent residency, and make it harder to qualify for family reunifications.
Norway, a member of the Schengen area of free movement even though it is not a member of the European Union, has also increasingly used media channels to discourage new arrivals, in particular the growing number of migrants arriving via the Arctic route across northern Russia.
Other Nordic countries have recently announced a similar tightening of their asylum policies.
The Norwegian migration agency said Thursday it would need to find 100,000 beds for new arrivals by the end of 2016.
""The situation is critical in terms of creating asylum places,"" its director Frode Forfang said.

The asylum seekers suspected of being prostituted were between the ages of 15 and 18, according to VG.
“There could be more unreported cases when it comes to the number of possible victims of human trafficking - the numbers we have are based on manual reports. Many unaccompanied minor asylum seekers came to Norway last autumn and so far this year, we have not registered any reports that unaccompanied minor asylum seekers in the centres have prostituted themselves,” Norwegian Directorate of Immigration (UDI) press spokesman John Olav said.
A recent report from the Fafo Research Foundation described how the staff of a Norwegian asylum centre were helpless witnesses to a 16-year-old girl being forced to visit the nearest town to sell sex. UDI had no authority to take enforcement action and Child Protection Services (CPS) did not intervene.
“If 16-year-olds are prostituting themselves, CPS should take action, precisely because UDI is unable to. The local child welfare office must consider taking [the victim into] protective custody,” Guri Tyldum, one of the researchers behind the Fafo report, said.
Earlier this month, asylum centres in Denmark and Sweden also raised alarms about the possible prostitution of underage asylum seekers. At Center Sandholm, Denmark’s largest asylum centre, staff reported that young boys would often “receive a phone call, take off for a few hours and then come back with designer clothes.”

Minister of Migration and Integration Sylvi Listhaug has been in the eye of a political storm for weeks, as critics attack her harsh immigration rhetoric and policies that they say only focus on keeping people out of Norway rather than addressing how to integrate them into Norwegian society.
On Wednesday, Labour Party spokeswoman Helga Pedersen essentially accused the government of having no integration plan whatsoever.
“Last year, over 30,000 asylum seekers came to Norway. The majority of these will likely be granted residency in Norway. It is an enormous task to house and integrate them in Norway. Therefore we need an active integration policy – and I don't think our current government has one,” Pedersen said in parliament.
Listhaug has fought back at critics by saying integration is simply not possible unless Norway gets a handle on how many people come in to the country.
“If we are to succeed with integration, we need to have control over the influx. I will not change the way I talk [about the issue],” she said at a Tuesday meeting in Kristiansand, according to news agency NTB.
She said that her rhetoric can “absolutely not” be blamed for the waffling support for the hard-line asylum package and instead accused her critics of using her as a scapegoat.

“It would be directly irresponsible if parties in parliament vote against the proposal because they don't like my choice of words or want to ensure that the government is handed a defeat,” she said.
Listhaug, who represents the anti-immigration Progress Party (Fremskrittspartiet), announced her 40-point plan in December by saying that a continued increase in asylum seekers could have “devastating consequences” for Norwegian society.
She said this week that she sees no need to change the way she addresses the issue.
“I will continue to talk about immigration. The Norwegian society has nothing to gain by sweeping the problems under the rug,” she said.
After a tumultuous few weeks of wavering support for the asylum plans and criticism of Listhaug's approach, the government has now asked all political parties behind the asylum plan to meet in Prime Minister Erna Solberg's office on March 1st to find a way to move forward.
Listhaug said that the meeting would be used to go through the 40 initiatives and “clarify issues that are unresolved and identify the points that are the most difficult” to find agreement on.
Proposals in Listhaug's plan include tighter rules on family reunification and a minimum period of five years before permanent residence is granted, an increase from the previous three years. Underage asylum seekers under 18 will also have their cases reassessed when they turn 18, and the bar for refugees' language and cultural understanding requirements will be set higher.
The plan calls for refugees to have held a job or been in education for four years before they can bring their family members to Norway. That goes even further than the country's southern neighbour Denmark, which has been heavily criticized for making refugees wait three years to be reunited with their families. The Norwegian Bar Association has warned that Listhaug's proposal will violate Norway's international conventions.

In parliament on Wednesday, Listhaug declined to say if she would be willing to change some of the proposal's more controversial elements in order to obtain wider support, saying only that the need for tighter rules is as relevant today as when the government first put forth its proposal.
“We will face an enormous challenge this year. It is expected that twice as many asylum seekers will come to Europe than the year before,” she said."

Current trends point towards Sweden also gradually following the Danish line, according to the expert.
Denmark’s internationally criticized asylum policies are beginning to look like a model for the Scandinavian countries, after Norway’s Minister of Integration Sylvi Listhaug presented a series of new measures that she claimed would make Oslo’s asylum policies “Europe’s toughest.”
Kristian Kriegsbaum Jensen, a PhD student in Scandinavian integration policy at Aarhus University, told state broadcaster DR that Norway’s proposed new rules resemble those of Denmark “incredibly” closely.
Norway’s government wants to make family reunification harder as well as introduce stricter criteria for permanent residence to be granted.
“It is almost a copy of Denmark,” said Jensen, while noting that Norway, unlike Denmark, has not yet reduced welfare payments for refugees.
“Denmark has cut back on payments to refugees – so far, this has not been suggested in Norway,” said Jensen.
While Sweden has received significantly more asylum applications – around 190,000 compared to Denmark’s 18,492 (not including December) and 35,358 for Norway in 2015 – Sweden’s policies are also beginning to follow the examples set by its two Scandinavian neighbours, albeit at a slower pace.
Although Sweden has not cut welfare support and does not require asylum seekers to have language skills in order to be granted asylum, it has begun to tighten its family reunification and residency rules.
All three countries have now also introduced border controls.
“Sweden has a softer approach, but is basically using the same ideas. Denmark, Norway and Sweden are all following a formula whereby they try to make themselves less attractive for refugees relative to their neighbours,” Andreas Kamm, general secretary with the Danish Refugee Council, told DR."

She was found on Tuesday morning in a car on the regional county road (fylkesvei) 33 in Eidsvoll.
The man charged with her murder is a 38-year-old Norwegian citizen who is also originally from Iran. He has no previous convictions, according to his lawyer.
The 38-year-old from Oslo, who was the woman's boyfriend, has admitted to causing her death, according to NRK’s report. He is charged with murder and due to appear in court to be remanded in custody on Wednesday.

Only a few months after a number of immigration reforms aimed at making Norway a less attractive destination for refugees and migrants were pushed through the Norwegian parliament, Integration Minister Sylvi Listhaug of the anti-immigration Progress Party has now warned that further restrictions may be on the horizon.
In an interview with the Dagbladet newspaper, Listhaug said that the reforms implemented earlier this year were inadequate.
“It is first and foremost bad for the country that we did not introduce more restrictions,” said the minister.
Listhaug specifically noted that the areas of family reunification and the rules for unaccompanied minors ought to be reviewed.
“We have already warned the Labour Party that legislation should be more restrictive in these areas,” Listhaug said.
“It definitely cannot be ruled out that we must introduce more restrictions. We have to keep a close eye on what goes on in Sweden and Denmark. If restrictions in those countries result in more people making their way here, then we also have to enact measures.”
Listhaug has advocated a hard-line approach to immigration and asylum that has resulted in Norway's asylum numbers plummeting by 95 percent. Her policies have made her simultaneously one of Norway's most admired and controversial politicians.
In the final four months of 2015, a record number of asylum seekers came to Norway. During the first four months of this year, the numbers plummeted by 95 percent according to the Norwegian Directorate of Immigration (UDI).

					15:01 CET+01:00				",The Local,Norway grants asylum to torture-fearing Turkish officers,"Turkish military personnel have ignored orders to return home following last year's attempted coup and have now been granted asylum in Norway, saying they fear torture should they return home.
Four officers, as well as a military attaché, have been given asylum after appealing for protection following the failed coup attempt on July 15th last year, reports Norwegian newspaper VG.
A lawyer representing the men confirmed to Norwegian media Klassekampen that all five had been given asylum in the Scandinavian country.
The decision by Norway to give the men asylum is notable given both Turkey and Norway's membership in the Nato military alliance.
The officers and attaché in question were stationed in Norway at the time of the attempted coup and claim that they had nothing to do with it, writes Klassekampen.
In January, the four officers told VG that they had been removed from their positions and ordered to return to Turkey.
They chose instead to remain in Norway and apply for asylum, saying that they feared imprisonment should they return to their home country.
“It is impossible to return now. I have been removed from my post in Norway and my passport has been cancelled. If I go back now, I will immediately be arrested and forced to give false confessions,” one of the officers said to VG in January.
“In Turkish prisons people die for unexplained reasons,” the officer added.
Turkish presidential advisor Numan Kurtulmuş said via state news agency Anadolu that he did not accept the men's explanation for not returning to Turkey.
“It is impossible to accept this. It is wrong. It is protecting and defending this gang known to be Fetö [the Turkish government's name for the Gülen movement, which it accuses of being being the July 2016 attempted coup, ed.]. We want to make it clear that we do not accept this,” Kurtulmuş said.
All five officers along with their families are currently residing at secret addresses in Norway, reports Klassekampen."

""This is the most important thing for so many of our voters, and for me it is absolutely essential that we get a tightening,"" Christian Tybring-Gjedde, one of the party's most outspoken figures, told NRK on Monday. He said that if the Christian Democrat and Liberal Parties continued to refused to back the new centres, Norway's two-party coalition should scrap the cooperation agreement it signed with the other two parties in September. ""We cannot have a minority dictatorship where two sections representing five percent of voters decide the country's future with regard to asylum and immigration,"" Tybring-Gjedde said. ""It is too serious to allow two mini-parties to decide."" Negotiations ended on Monday without an agreement, with the two minority parties arguing that additional closed asylum centres were unnecessary given the spare capacity at the country's existing closed asylum centre at Trandum, near Oslo. The Liberal and Christian Democrat parties also want some of the 1,320 children who have been refused asylum, but who have been in the country more than three years, to be given an amnesty. Tybring-Gjedde said he would be willing to accept an amnesty for some asylum children, so long as there is a strong overall reduction in the number of asylum seekers granted residence in the country. Ann-Magrit Austenå, from the the Norwegian Norwegian Organisation for Asylum Seekers (NOAS), said she believed Tybring-Gjedde's statements were simply part of Progress's negotiating tactics. ""It's a play to put pressure on the people negotiating,"" she said. ""They need something symbolic that they can use to say 'we have made a stricter asylum policy', but it's not so easy for them to get real changes that the Liberal parties will not see as a possible violation of human rights."" She said that she believed that Progress would not ultimately fail to win the right to build new detention centres. ""I think it's going to be blocked, because there's no capacity problem as such today,"" she said."

Four Syrians who wanted to seek asylum in Norway were turned away from a Color Line ferry that travels between the Danish port town of Hirtshals to the Norwegian town of Larvik on Thursday after stepped up Norwegian border controls took effect earlier in the day.

“We did what we were asked to do – control identification and admission papers to Norway. If one cannot show that, they can't travel,” Color Line spokesman Helge Otto Mathisen told Norwegian broadcaster NRK.
“They said they were refugees and wanted to seek asylum in Norway,” Mathisen added.
The four would-be asylum seekers had all purchased tickets for the ferry.
According to Mathisen, the denial of the Syrians marks the first time the operator has turned away would-be passengers for lacking the proper documents. It was not immediately known if the group would instead seek asylum in Denmark.
Norwegian PM Erna Solberg announced on Tuesday that her country would begin checking all ferries into Norway from Denmark, Sweden and Germany. Border controls at land crossings have also been increased.
Under the new increased controls, ferry operators are obligated to ensure that all passengers have legitimate travel documents before docking in Norway.

Norway upped its border controls following Sweden's announcement that it would significantly tighten its asylum rules. Denmark has said it will not implement any border controls, with Danish PM Lars Løkke Rasmussen arguing that doing so would result in more, not fewer, asylum seekers.
That was an opinion shared by Solberg as recently as a week ago, when she said it was a “misperception” that implementing border controls will bring down the number of asylum seekers coming to any given nation."

""That is not the case when an asylum child goes missing."" The children and teenagers in question had all travelled to Norway as unaccompanied minors.

					10:03 CEST+02:00				",The Local,PM 'happy' with asylum restrictions but wants more,"Norwegian Prime Minister Erna Solberg on Wednesday touted her government’s success in delivering on its 2013 election promises but said she regrets that she couldn’t push through even more asylum restrictions.
“Although the world has changed, we have stood firm on many of the main priorities of the campaign,” Solberg said at her semi-annual press conference on Wednesday.
“One of the important things this government does is to safeguard Norway for the future. We had a plan, we had an agenda, and we continue to work on it,” she added.
Solberg touted strengthening elderly rights, cutting waiting times in the health sector and improving patient rights. She also pointed to improved substance abuse care and psychiatric services, not to mention the tightening of the nation’s asylum policies.
“We now have a significantly lower influx of refugees. Some of it is due to putting behind us a long stretch with border controls that allowed many to previously seek asylum. Some of it is due to many now perceiving Norway as a stricter country and thus fewer people seek to come here,” the PM said.
She added that the strict asylum policy must be supplemented with clearer integration policies, and that an integration proposal presented by the government has gained traction in parliament.
By her own calculations, Solberg’s government is well on its way to fulfilling the promises it set out in 2013. Since autumn, the government has presented 207 propositions and 39 messages to parliament. Only in 12 instances was the government fully or partially defeated, according to the prime minister.
“That means 95 percent have gone through,” Solberg said.
She said that the toughest defeat was the inability to push through even more asylum restrictions.
“If we had gotten a somewhat tighter policy, Norway would have been better prepared for a greater influx. But we succeeded in some of the important moves, so I’m happy,” she said.
She also cited the downturn in the oil industry as one of her government’s biggest unforeseen challenges.
“We see positive signs in that there is an increased access to [oil industry job] vacancies, including in Rogaland and Hordaland. But it is too early to say whether the bottom has been reached,” the PM stated.
She said another challenge is the emergence of a deep distrust of politicians, elites and transnational cooperation.
She fears that if Brits on Thursday vote to leave the EU, it will fuel such sentiments and and make the other EU countries more concerned about themselves and their own national problems.
“The EU is not in crisis now, but if we see Brexit, it will intensify the situation,” Solberg said."
