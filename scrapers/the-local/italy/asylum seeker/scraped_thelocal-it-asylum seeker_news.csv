					09:47 CEST+02:00				",Patrick Browne,From asylum seeker in Italy to organic yoghurt entrepreneur,"They say entrepreneurial spirit flourishes in the face of great adversity and Barikamà, an organic yoghurt business which employs six former asylum seekers in Rome, is the perfect example.
Each week the staff at Barikamà produce 200 litres of organic yoghurt which they deliver to customers by bicycle and sell from stalls at local markets in the city.
The operation has been such a success they have started to branch out into organic vegetables and now cultivate a hectare of land on the outskirts of the city.
Barikamà – a word which in Bambara, the principle language of Mali, means 'resistance' is a successful example of a micro-enterprise, a small-scale business which provides its workers with self-sufficiency and requires little or no initial investment.
“I set the business up in 2010 because I had no work and refused to go and toil in the fields of southern Italy, where I had spent painful six months before coming to Rome”, Barikamà founder Suleman, a 30-year-old from Mali, told The Local.
Suleman's story
A journey of 1,958 miles begins with a single step and Suleman took his in July 2008 when he left his small village in southern Mali bound for Italy.
Ahead of him lay the Sahara dessert, an illegal journey across the perilous Mediterranean, six months' exploitation in the fields of Calabria and finally, his own business in Rome.
“When you begin the journey you don't see it as dangerous. I don't think anybody does,” Suleman said.
“Everybody thinks: 'if something terrible is going to happen, it will happen to the other guy, not me.'”
After working for two months in Libya to amass the $700 needed to pay a trafficker to take him to Europe, Suleman was dropped in a dinghy off the coast of Sicily with 28 other Africans.
“But arriving is only he beginning of a new set of problems, the biggest of which is getting your papers in order,” he said.
Upon arrival, Suleman quickly applied for asylum on humanitarian grounds, but while laws state the granting of permits should take no more than 35 days, the process normally takes between 18 months and two years as the Italian system is overwhelmed by the volume of applicants it receives.
Processing is one of the biggest problems facing both the Italian state and its refugees, despite the establishment of a series of so-called 'hotspots' last year.
In the first six months of 2016, more than 70,000 migrants have arrived in Italy - the majority of them from sub-Saharan Africa.
“We waited for months, but nothing came through. Being unable to work left us all in terrible limbo, so we left Sicily for Rosarno, Calabria, where most illegals go to work,” Suleman explained.
Oranges and exploitation
For the next six months, Suleman and his friends spent 12 hours each day working in the citrus groves of Calabria for a mere €20 a day.
During that time they lived in the makeshift camps around Rosarno alongside thousands of other illegal workers. The medical humanitarian organization, Doctors Without Borders, has described the living conditions in the camps as 'worse than third-world.'
“You finally can make some money but you can just as easily die,” Suleman said.
It's not an exaggeration. Last year, tens of workers from sub-Saharan Africa dropped dead from exposure and exhaustion, having been pushed too hard in the sun-baked fields of southern Italy.
“Then there's the danger that someone will shoot you,” he adds bitterly, referring to a period of violent clashes between migrant workers which erupted after three labourers were shot with an air-rifle on their way back to the camps in January 2010.
The shootings sparked numerous protests and string of violent clashes between local residents, migrants and the police, which left 66 injured.
As racial tensions reached breaking point the government shipped 1,300 migrants off to different cities in Italy.
Suleman and his friends ended up in Rome, where they slept rough at the central Termini station and relied on the Catholic church-run charity, Caritas, to provide him with meals.
The wounds in Rosarno have still not healed. Last month tensions flared up once more, when police shot and killed Sekine Traorè, a worker from Mali, after he allegedly pulled a knife on a police officer.
Eventually Suleman and his friends were taken in by volunteers from ex-Snia, a social centre housed in a former factory in central Rome, who helped the group get their papers.
They may have been legal workers, but they were now at the back of Italy's job queue and feared they would end up toiling in the fields once more .
“The guys at ex-Snia helped me set up the business and I started by making just fifteen litres of yoghurt, which I sold at a local market. Since then, things have been steadily growing,"" Suleman explained.
A model to follow
“Now the business provides work for six migrants, from all over Africa, and we've also added an Italian, Mauro, who suffers from Aspergers Syndrome. He joined us last year and has been great.""
According to the International Office for Migration (IOM), micro-enterprises like Barikaimà represent the best alternative to humanitarian aid, and boost levels of social integration and self-esteem among refugees.
Suleman is living proof. Thanks to Barikimà, he is a fully-integrated member of Italian society, making an important contribution to his local community and economy.
Working to set up the business he has learned to speak fluent Italian and fallen in love with Ilaria, a Roman who he met at Ex-Snia.
The pair has been together ever since and earlier this year celebrated the birth of a baby boy.
“People say Italy is a racist country, but even after my time in Rosarno, I don't think so. Racists, idiots and hateful people can be found all over the globe.
“I wish people would stop calling high immigration 'a migration crisis' though. When people come to live in your country to work, share their culture and expertise, it should be seen as a blessing.”"

While first-time asylum requests fell significantly across the 28 EU members as a whole, said statistics office Eurostat, in Italy they rose by 4 percent, from 121,185 in 2016 to 126,550 last year.
Italy now accounts for 19.5 percent of all such requests in the EU, second only to Germany with 30.5 percent. France is third with 14 percent.

Most of Italy's asylum applications came from Nigerian nationals, according to Eurostat. They made up 20 percent of applicants, followed by people from Bangladesh (10 percent) and Pakistan (7 percent).
That sets Italy apart from the rest of the EU, where overall most first-time asylum seekers come from Syria, Iraq or Afghanistan.
While Italy received more requests for asylum than almost any other country, it rejected more than half of them. Little over 40 percent of applicants were granted any protection in the first instance and fewer than 10 percent received full refugee status, well below the EU-wide total of 23 percent.

Overall, Italy was 19th out of 28 countries in terms of the applications it approved. The figures do not take into account cases where applicants appealed the decision, however.
Relative to its population, Italy receives fewer asylum requests per million inhabitants than Greece, Cyprus, Luxembourg, Malta, Austria, Germany or Sweden.
Nor are the numbers of requests growing fastest in Italy. Between 2016 and 2017, Spain, France and Greece saw applications rise by several thousand more than Italy did.

					09:00 CET+01:00				",Emma Anderson ,Italy sees Ukrainian asylum seeker boom,"Italy saw a huge spike in Ukrainians applying for asylum in 2014, according to data released by Eurostat last week and analyzed by The Local.
Italy received the third highest number of Ukrainian asylum seekers last year, but also saw one of the greatest increases in applications. In 2013, just 35 Ukrainians applied for asylum in Italy, but that number jumped to 2,080 in 2014 - a startling 60 times the number from 2013.
Italy accepted the highest number of Ukrainian applicants compared to all other EU countries, with 165 applicants receiving positive outcomes, followed by the Czech Republic (150) and Finland (145).
Julia Zelvenska, a senior legal officer at the European Council on Refugees and Exiles, told The Local that many of those who applied for asylum, including in Italy, were those who were already in the country.
""For example, they were working or studying when the situation in Ukraine changed,"" she said.
""Asylum applicants choose specific countries usually because they either have friends or family in a particular country, could rely on the support from the community, sometimes speak the language or might have other ties with the country.""
Overall, the number of Ukrainian asylum seekers in the 28 EU member states ballooned to 14,040 people in 2014 - more than 13 times higher than the number in 2013 at 1,060 applicants.
That number is even greater when compared to 2008, the beginning of the global economic crisis, when 925 Ukrainians applied for asylum.
“What we have seen from our members working with asylum seekers are those who are fleeing the conflict in the east of Ukraine,” Zelvenska added. “In the past, it has been for political persecution, like in 2013, or for sexual orientation.”
The UN refugee agency (UNHCR) said last month that an estimated one million Ukrainians were displaced internally, with many people moving west. Some 600,000 people had sought asylum, many of them in non-EU countries such as Russia, Belarus and Moldova.
But many Ukrainians also applied for asylum in the European Union in 2014, a year that started with a revolution in Kiev and the ousting of the pro-Russian president, Viktor Yanukovych.
Russia then annexed Crimea in March, in a move widely condemned around the world, before propping up separatists fighting bloody battles with Ukrainian forces in the east of the country.
After last year's spike, the numbers have so far decreased this year, Zelvenska said.
""Recent number of asylum applications by Ukrainian asylum seekers in Europe indeed increased in 2014, but have so far been decreasing in 2015. In general, the numbers still remain quite low, for example, in February 2015 only 125 Ukrainians applied for asylum in Europe.""
Of those who applied for asylum in 2014, 650 Ukrainians received positive outcomes on their first application decision in the EU. Eurostat defines positive outcomes as grants of refugee or subsidiary protection status, or an authorisation to stay for humanitarian reasons.
Still, those who received good news were greatly outnumbered by those who were rejected in their first try - 2,335.

Zelvenska explained that it is generally very hard for Ukrainians to gain asylum in EU member states, or to even reach those countries in the first place.
“One of the main reasons people get rejected may be that many countries are not clear on how the situation developed and won’t issue decisions until it is clear how the Ukrainian situation is going to develop,” she said.
“European countries are also being very formalistic in the criteria for asylum,” Zelvenska added. “For example, they may say that there are options for alternative protection already within Ukraine. For people in the east, they may say that they could relocate to the west.”
Zelvenska noted though that reasons for rejection are not made public so it is difficult to know for certain.
“We think it’s not necessary to apply all the criteria in a strict manner,” she said. “They must consider each case, country and the circumstances.”
Last year, EU countries received the highest number of asylum seekers since 1992 with a total of 626,000 applicants. More than 400,000 people applied in 2013."

					08:37 CET+01:00				",AFP,Asylum seekers strut their stuff on Italian catwalk,"Asylum seekers from Mali and Gambia strutted down the catwalk on Thursday at Florence's prestigious Pitti Uomo exhibition, kicking off an initiative to school would-be migrant fashionistas in Italy's top art.
In a fashion world first, farmers and construction workers who made the perilous journey by boat to Italy in May took centre stage in Tuscany's capital, modelling everything from sharply-tailored suits to tasselled jumpers and outlandish hats.
Despite initially appearing a touch overawed, they pulled off the trademark model walk - one even shooting the cameras a smouldering look worthy of a supermodel as he stopped to pose at the end of the runway.
The men, aged between 19 and 27, who could not be identified for legal reasons, were handpicked for the show from their reception centres by the ITC Ethical Fashion Initiative, which mentors young emerging designers from Africa.
""As we are in Italy and have a huge refugee crisis we also want to show that migrants are a resource,"" EFI head and founder Simone Cipriani told AFP backstage before the event, which featured four collections by African stylists.
""We are setting up a training centre for refugees and migrants in Italy to work in the industry of fashion and be enabled to go back home and set up their own businesses there,"" he said.
The project is being launched with Lai-momo, an Italian association which raises awareness of migration issues and since 2014 has been involved in running a series of reception centres in and around Bologna, in Italy's centre-north.
'Asylum seeker in a suit'
Five long-legged men with chiseled jaws were chosen from the centres for the fashion challenge, with two taking part in a photo shoot on Wednesday and three walking the catwalk in a converted warehouse, along with professional models.
Nigerian-American designer Wale Oyejide, whose Ikire Jones brand plays on a juxtaposition of African figures and classical Western art, said working with the debutants had been a perfect way to illustrate his fashion philosophy.
""Clothing is just a vehicle, I'm much more interested in discussing these issues... of migration, of borders being crossed.
""If I take an asylum seeker and put them in a suit, people perceive them in a certain way, which hopefully allows them to think of them as an equal human being, not as someones less than them,"" he said.
As two of the first-time models apprehensively took their seats in the make-up studio, the third was given a one-to-one tutorial in how to speed up his swagger to match the pumping beats of the catwalk.
Lai-momo president Andrea Marchesini Reggiani said the plan was to tap into the Made in Italy resource to tackle one of the greatest problems plaguing those waiting for their asylum applications to be processed: boredom.
""It's very difficult to work with migrants today, it's very difficult for them to integrate, because their numbers are very high and we are faced with a very deep economic crisis,"" he said.
But while many of the 140,000 migrants who arrived in Italy in 2015 are stuck doing nothing in centres, ""we already have small-scale collaborations with guests who are skilled in couture or design.
""The idea is to develop those skills in a dedicated laboratory, and maybe even produce garments as well,"" he said."

The incident happened in the town of Bisceglie, on Puglia's Adriatic coast, when an armed robber entered a supermarket with his face covered and brandishing a kitchen knife, La Stampa reports.
The man threatened the cashier at knifepoint and forced her to hand over the draw of the cash register, which contained €380.
But as he tried to escape with his loot he was chased down by the Nigerian asylum seeker, who was working outside the supermarket helping shoppers transport their groceries to their cars in exchange for small change.
As the man attempted to make his getaway, the young Nigerian gave chase, causing the would-be robber to drop the draw of the cash register. The man then turned his knife on his pursuer, but instead of backing down, the asylum seeker, from Nigeria, wrestled with the criminal and managed to disarm him.
The man then managed to wriggle free and reclaim the money before jumping on to his scooter to make an escape. However, during the tussle, the Nigerian had removed the bandanna he was using to cover his face.
Thanks to that intervention, police were able to use footage taken by a nearby CCTV camera to identify the would-be robber as a 31-year-old Italian from the nearby city of Molfetta, who was a well known to the forces for previous offences.

					09:49 CEST+02:00				",The Local/AFP,First asylum seekers leave Italy under EU plan,"UPDATED: A small group of Eritreans left Italy for Sweden on Friday, the first contingent of asylum-seekers to be relocated under a European Union scheme to ease the burden of the migration crisis on frontline countries.
Grinning shyly before the media, 19 young Eritreans shook hands with EU migration commissioner Dimitris Avramopoulos and waved as they boarded a financial police plane at Rome's Ciampino airport.
""Today is an important day for the European Union, it is a day of victory... for those who believe in Europe, for those who believed in saving human lives,"" Italian Interior Minister Angelino Alfano told journalists after the departure.
""It is a defeat for those who claim it is better for the Mediterranean to become a lake of death... and believe that scaring the European people is the way forward,"" he added.
The asylum seekers are being transferred to Sweden after it agreed on July 20th to take refugees from Italy and Greece in a bid to ease the humanitarian and financial burden on the two frontline states over two years.
They will fly to Luleå in northern Sweden, after which they will hand in their applications for asylum at a centre in Boden, according to a press release from Sweden's Migration Agency. The refugees - 14 men and five women - will then be offered a spot at a centre for refugees in the Östersund area in Sweden's Jämtland region.
Swedish Migration Minister Morgan Johansson welcomed that the scheme was being implemented for the first time on Friday at an EU summit in Luxembourg on Thursday.
“This is the first example of this issue of redistribution that we have fought for so much, to make sure that we are all prepared to accept our part of the responsibility,” he was quoted by the Swedish TT news agency as telling fellow ministers.
“Symbolically, it's very important. (…) It is important now that all countries live up to what we have actually promised each other. We break the ice and make sure that the implementation begins,” he said.
The EU formally agreed on the plan last month despite the opposition of some eastern European states worried about a popular backlash to migrants.
'More must be done'
Alfano said Italy was ready to relocate 100 more asylum-seekers who would go to Germany and the Netherlands, and the UNHCR said further relocations would take place from Italy at the beginning of next week.
""This is a significant day, a positive and important one,"" the UN refugee agency's southern Europe spokeswoman, Carlotta Sami, told AFP.
""But we know more must be done. There is a great need for measures to be put in place to allow (asylum-seekers) to arrive in Europe safely,"" she said, referring to perilous boat crossings in the Mediterranean which have cost over 3,000 people their lives this year alone.
The Eritreans had been rescued on the high seas over the past few weeks and taken to an experimental migrant screening centre or ""hotspot"" on Lampedusa island, where they were registered.
Avramopoulos and Asselborn were expected to travel to the Italian island later Friday to examine the centre, a prototype for several set to open at the end of November across Italy and Greece.
On Thursday, EU nations agreed to speed up the deportation of failed asylum seekers and crack down on so-called ""economic migrants"" - who are largely from poor African nations and not refugees from conflict zones.
A UN report in June detailed how the Horn of Africa nation, under Isaias Afwerki's iron-fisted regime for the past 22 years, has created a repressive system in which people are routinely arrested on a whim, detained, tortured, killed or disappeared.
The EU hopes the closed centres will sharply reducing the number of people who arrive by boat, refuse to be identified and head off across the borders to other bloc countries to seek a new life.
The centres and relocations are part of a multi-point plan which includes a military anti-people trafficker operation.
The UN's Security Council is set to vote Friday on a draft resolution to authorise military action against smugglers with Operation Sophia, which launched this week to seize traffickers' boats in international waters.
While the vote is not necessary for the EU to take action, the measure would legitimise plans under which European warships will board ships for inspection, confiscate them and even dispose of vessels used by migrant smugglers."

This latest sign of Italy moving to a tougher approach to deter further migrant arrivals, was approved by decree at a cabinet meeting on Friday.
It comes into force immediately but has to be approved by parliament inside two months.
Around half a million migrants have arrived in Italy in the last three years, most of them Africans who were rescued from overcrowded boats in the Mediterranean after setting off from Libya on vessels operated by people smugglers.
Registered asylum requests rose from 23,620 in 2013 to 123,482 last year and the average time taken to study them has risen from 167 to 268 days.
""The complexity of the migratory phenomenon is also increasing with people arriving from very different countries,"" Justice Minister Andrea Orlando said after the cabinet meeting.
""We are talking about life-defining decisions, we don't want to leave people in limbo,"" he added.
The government is also recruiting 250 additional specialists to speed up the work of the commissions which carry out the first assessment of asylum requests.
Around 60 percent of those end with a decision to deny the applicant the right to remain in Italy.
The new courts will be designed to ensure people in this case have their appeals heard much quicker and that a binding decision is made at that stage.
As things stand, rejected asylum seekers can generally mount two appeals in a lengthy process that overturns the original denial in an estimated 70 percent of cases.
""These will be specialised judges with detailed knowledge of migration issues,"" Orlando said, denying the abolition of a second appeal involved lowering standards of legal protection.
The UN refugee agency welcomed the strengthening of the asylum commissions but voiced reservations about the new courts.
""There will have to be a very thorough examination of individual cases. If it is impossible to appeal, the first hearing has to be as good as possible with the emphasis on quality rather than speed,"" a spokeswoman said.
Orlando vowed the commissions would become more reliable and consistent in their decisions thanks to the new recruits and the recording of all discussions becoming compulsory.
Friday's initiative follows recent moves by the government to make it easier for migrants awaiting decisions on their fate to do voluntary work that will help them integrate into Italian society.
Italy has also recently agreed to help train Libya's coastguard to better police its coastal waters to reduce the number of boats leaving the country, and to help its former colony with the running of centres to house migrants pending their repatriation to their home countries.
On Friday, the government announced the creation of around 20 permanent repatriation centres capable of housing a total of 1,600 people pending deportation."

Most of the migrants seeking asylum in Italy arrive from North Africa after perilous overland journeys and even more dangerous crossings of the Mediterranean, which almost invariably end with their overcrowded boats having
to be rescued by the Italian coastguard.
They are barred from taking paid work at the beginning of Italy's asylum application procedure and jobs are thin on the ground afterwards.

""We have to work on integration, on voluntary repatriations of people who don't have the right to asylum, and standardize asylum at the European level because we can't have 27 different asylum policies in Europe,"" Gentiloni said.
The Italian leader spoke at a press conference in Lyon, France, where he met with French President Emmanuel Macron, who in a speech on Tuesday proposed an EU agency to handle asylum requests as part of his vision for reforming the bloc.

How Italy's African entrepreneurs are helping to ease migrant pressure
""What is considered one of the biggest concerns of our citizens must also be one of the major policies of our European Union "" Gentiloni said about the immigration crisis facing the continent since 2015.
The European Commission on Wednesday again called on the 27 member states - excluding Britain, which is leaving the bloc - to quickly adopt a ""lasting reform"" of common regulations on asylum in Europe, which has been stalled for more than a year.
The right to asylum in Europe is currently the responsibility of the EU country where the asylum seeker arrive, a procedure Brussels wants to maintain while adding a ""correction mechanism"" to help countries that are coping with a huge influx of migrants - such as Italy and Greece.
Brussels is looking for a new solution after the EU's troubled migrant quota scheme for distributing new arrivals around the bloc wrapped up on Wednesday after two years.
The plan had deepened a rift between the older western members and the newer eastern states, with Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic refusing to be obliged to take in asylum seekers.
The migration issue has also fuelled the rise of populism in several EU member states, seen most recently in Germany, where the anti-immigrant AfD party garnered 12.6 percent in national elections on Sunday and will enter the federal parliament for the first time.

The move by Mayor Angelo Lanza comes a week after an elderly man was hit by a car on a poorly-lit road in Flumeri, in Italy’s Campania region. The man’s death was the latest in a series of accidents on the town’s Statale 91 road, where there is also a hotel hosting 44 asylum-seekers from African countries. Under Lanza’s order, the asylum-seekers must now wear a high-visibility jacket when they go out in the late afternoon or evening.

The mayor had previously implored the local cooperative supporting the asylum-seekers to take more care on the road, a plea which reportedly fell on deaf ears.

They will be put to work thanks to a scheme launched on Tuesday by the city's waste authority, Aimat, and city council.
The agreement will allow refugees waiting for their asylum claims to be processed – a process that can take over a year - to volunteer as workers for Aimat, where they will be allowed to work a six-hour cleaning shift each Saturday without pay.
The programme will see groups of 20 refugees hired at a time to perform 12 weeks of service.
They will work in mixed teams alongside full-time Aimat employees and will be deployed in different areas of the city.
While the refugees won't be paid, volunteering will provide them with the opportunity for integration, offer work experience and give them something to do.
Crucially, for Elide Tisi, Turin's deputy mayor, the programme is about giving something back.
“It's a useful scheme, but the most important thing is that it allows asylum seekers to give something in exchange for the support they are receiving in helping build a new life here,” Tisi said.
“It also highlights the work we are doing throughout the city to promote an attitude, not of welfarism, but of responsibility.”
While the work is unpaid, it is likely many asylum seekers will subscribe to it.
In the past, grateful refugees have been the first to chip-in during cleanup operations in the wake of extreme weather events across Italy.

The announcement by Kurz in Berlin after talks with German Interior Minister Horst Seehofer marks a shot across the bow at Chancellor Angela Merkel, who is trying to pull together a deal for EU cooperation on placing asylum seekers.
Seehofer - who is locked in an open migration feud with Merkel that is threatening the stability of her coalition government - said that he and his far-right Austrian and Italian counterparts, Herbert Kickl and Matteo Salvini, had formed their alliance this week.
He said their cooperation would extend to ""issues of security and terrorism"" but did not offer specifics on what it would entail.
Kurz, whose country assumes the EU's rotating presidency on July 1st, said he welcomed the ""good cooperation that we want to develop between Rome, Vienna and Berlin"".
""I think it marks very sensible cooperation that will contribute to reducing illegal migration to Europe,"" Kurz told reporters. ""We believe an axis of the willing is needed to fight illegal migration.""
Merkel has firmly rejected a plan put forward by Seehofer to turn back at German borders any asylum seeker already registered in another EU country. She argues that her country should not go it alone while Europe searches for a common policy.
Seehofer has won support from Salvini, who on Monday flatly refused to allow a rescue vessel carrying hundreds of migrants to dock.
Despite the gulf between them, Seehofer insisted Wednesday that he was committed to striking a compromise with Merkel this week, although what shape it would take appeared completely unknown.
""We will definitely find a solution,"" he said.
Merkel was re-elected for a fourth term in September but saw her ruling majority depleted by voter unease over the influx of more than one million asylum seekers in 2015-16.
Kurz won the chancellery last year in an alliance with the far-right, vowing to tackle illegal immigration, an issue that also propelled a populist alliance to power in Italy.
The Austrian centre-right leader said in Berlin Wednesday he was counting on the backing of his tough line during his EU presidency from countries such as the Netherlands and Denmark.
Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovakia have also consistently either refused outright or resisted taking in refugees under a contested EU quota system."

Amedeo Mancini, 35, was arrested on suspicion of murder on Thursday morning.
Namdi was walking with his wife, Chinyery, on Via Veneto in Fermo on Tuesday night when they suffered racial abuse. The football hooligan allegedly called Chinyery, 24, a ""monkey"".
That led to an altercation and Chidi was brutally beaten on the head, reportedly with a road-sign pole, until he fell to the ground.
The attack caused a brain hemorrhage that resulted in an irreversible coma. Namdi died on Wednesday.
The couple arrived in Italy last year after escaping an attack by the Islamic extremist group, Boko Haram, at a church in Nigeria in which they each lost their parents and their daughter.
Chinyery also lost her baby after the perilous Mediterranean crossing.

Divers have so far recovered 302 bodies from a migrant boat which sank on October 3rd, but little could have prepared them for the discovery of the youngest victim. A newborn baby boy was found attached to his mother, who had likely given birth as the ship sank, La Repubblica reported. “It was probably a premature birth, prompted by the fear and terror of the mother during the fire,” doctor Pietro Bartolo, who has been inspecting the bodies, told the newspaper. A fire is thought to have been lit by the captain to attract the attention of the coastguard after the boat started taking on water. But the fire spread and the boat capsized; only 155 of around 500 Eritrean and Somali passengers survived.
“In the past few days I have seen many bodies, but those of the children are always a terrible torment,” Bartolo said. “It was a further torment to see such a small body...it was terrible.” The woman and her son were placed together in a coffin, among the hundreds that rest in a hanger in Lampedusa’s airport, La Repubblica said.

Standing amid piles of shoes, t-shirts, pyjamas and baby bibs, Susanna Steri describes how she had to ask the inhabitants of Carbonia to stop bringing donations for the 90-odd men, women and children from Sierra Leone and Nigeria.
""We only had a few hours notice to prepare,"" Steri told AFP, describing the weekend of May 30th, after distress calls made from 22 boats in the Mediterranean led to the rescue of 4,200 migrants, and the discovery of 17 bodies.
Steri was told that of the 900 people being brought to the island, the ENAP centre -- once used to teach youngsters traditional trades -- would be receiving 90 in need of emergency housing, including a four month-old baby.
Just a few kilometres inland from golden beaches where tourists dock their yachts to paddle in crystal waters, the unemployed rolled their sleeves up.
""It's difficult to describe what happened, the real difficulty was finding place for all the volunteers, not the migrants,"" she said, as another local couple arrived bearing boxes full of biscuits, baby food, fruit and milk.
The collapse of the area's coal mining industry, followed in 2012 by the closure of the Alcoa aluminium smelter, has driven youth unemployment in the Carbonia-Iglesias province in south-west Sardinia to a towering 73.9 percent.
Doing the impossible
But while Lombardy, Veneto and Liguria in the country's wealthy north refuse to take in any more migrants -- with rich Val d'Aosta accepting just 62 - locals here are buying the refugees cigarettes and phone cards out of their own pockets.
The centre expects to receive €35 ($39) a day per migrant from the state, including two euros for pocket money, but pensioner Giulio Cadeddu, ex-financial policeman turned volunteer, says red tape means they won't see a cent for months.
""We're trying to do the impossible, how could we not for such sweet creatures?"" he says looking at a grinning Fatima, who celebrated her first birthday here, and whose colourful balloons still adorn the dining room.
Nearby, seven-year old twins from Sierra Leone wolf down pasta and chips and chatter excitedly as translators tell them plans are underway for volunteers to put on a summer party in the garden, complete with inflatable games and a clown.
The town's 30,000 inhabitants know the challenges of starting life somewhere new: Carbonia was built by Fascist dictator Benito Mussolini in 1938 to house coal miners, and many of its residents hail from Puglia, Sicily and Veneto.
The asylum seekers are being absorbed into the local poor, Steri has a deal with priest Don Amilcare, who prepares 200 meals for the local needy. If either group has leftover bread, fish or other foodstuffs, they are shared out.
A washing room in the centre is crammed with bottles of donated shampoos, shower gels, soaps, toothpaste tubes andnappies.
By God's grace
But despite their efforts, many of the refugees are unhappy, believing they would be better off on the mainland in big cities where they could look for work.
""The people here are the most wonderful I have ever met in my life,"" said 32-year old Rosalin from Nigeria, who fled Maiduguri for Libya when jihadist group Boko Harem bombed her shop, and paid a trafficker for a place with her family on a dinghy headed for Italy.
""My husband died during the crossing. I am pregnant and it is by the grace of God that we are here. But I need a transfer to a place that is more developed,"" she said, as her brothers-in-law spent another day doing nothing.
Lamin Johnny, a 35-year old from Sierra Leone who is married to one of Rosalin's sisters, said he had ""looked for work since we arrived, but nothing"".
Of the 90 migrants originally brought to the centre, only 48 remain, and the others are believed to have headed off in search of places with better prospects -- no mean feat in Italy, a country struggling to shake off a profound recession.
It is a situation with which the unemployed factory workers from the Alcoaplant sympathise, though even they have pitched in with caring for their new neighbours.
""And why wouldn't they? It's only the rich who are afraid of losing, the poor have nothing to fear,"" Steri said."

long way in two years, thanks to his skills with scissors.
The 26-year-old Burkina Faso native is the star student of a novel project aimed at training asylum seekers in one of Italy's most emblematic crafts: making leather handbags. And after a 15-month apprenticeship, Bassirou has just become the first employee of a small company set up with the aim of turning the project into a self-sustaining venture.
""It is a great opportunity,"" he says of his new career move. ""I had done a bit of cutting and sewing back home but that was with cloth, not leather. It wasn't easy at the start, every little thing seemed difficult, but after a certain point, you get the hang of it.""
Bassirou left Burkina Faso in west Africa, and a partner then pregnant with his now two-year-old daughter, in 2015. He says he fled because he feared for his life in the tumultuous aftermath of yet another military coup in the impoverished former French colony.
Now he is awaiting the outcome of his application for asylum in Italy and is one of some 400 recently-arrived immigrants being looked after by Lai-Momo, a social cooperative that runs the EU-funded leather skills project in the small town of Lama Di Reno near Bologna.
The decision to leave home was not an easy one, Bassirou says, and it is one he might have reconsidered had he known of the horrors that awaited him in Libya, the jumping off point for most Africans trying to get to Europe.
'It's slavery'
Shocking recent images of slave auctions in the troubled north African state came as no surprise. ""These are things that are really happening in Libya,"" Bassirou told AFPTV. ""I had a bit of a taste of it. They put us in a prison. At any time they could come and get us to do forced labour, all sorts of jobs. They never gave us enough to eat. ""All that, it's slavery,"" he said.
Bassirou endured these conditions for four months before the traffickers controlling his fate finally put him onto an inflatable dinghy packed with over 100 others.

After many fraught hours at sea, mostly spent praying it would not sink, the overcrowded dinghy was spotted by a British ship. ""At the moment we were rescued there was a bit of a stampede to get off and the boat started taking on water. In the end they got everyone off.""

The date, March 20th, 2016, is etched permanently in his memory. ""These are things you don't forget easily,"" he says. Now he dreams of being able to open his own shop, but the future path of his life remains uncertain, as is the case for tens of thousands like him in overcrowded reception centres across Italy.
Few of them will benefit from the kind of support that has helped Bassirou pursue his education to Italian high school level, or the distraction from the stress that comes with living in limbo.
""Doing this (working), you are going to have positive rather than negative thoughts, you're thinking that when you're finished, you'll have a trade,"" he says.
'Return issue not easy'
A total of 15 migrants have completed the first round of training and another 18 have just started, including Bassirou's compatriot, Issa. The 21-year-old recounts a similar tale about his time in Libya. ""I have friends who are still there in slave camps,"" Issa says. Having made it to Italy, he is now relieved to have escaped the frustrated boredom that is the lot of many asylum seekers.
""Before I came here, I was in another house, just sleeping all the time, doing nothing,"" he says. ""Now I feel much more relaxed. I have contact with (local) people and I'm beginning to learn the language."" Not all the apprentices can realistically aspire to the proficiency Bassirou has attained.
As some have limited literacy and numeracy, lessons in cutting have to be preceded by an introduction to basic concepts of measuring and geometry. ""The objective is to provide people with the ability and skills they need to enter the labour market here in Italy, but also in the event of a possible return to their country of origin,"" said Lai-Momo's president, Andrea Marchesini Reggiani.
The Lama Di Reno project is part of a wider programme overseen by the Ethical Fashion Initiative run by the United Nations and WTO-backed International Trade Centre with the aim of creating new economic opportunities in developing countries to help curb irregular migration.
People like Bassirou say going home is not an option they can contemplate, for now. And Marchesini Reggiani admits that the emphasis on voluntary repatriations can be problematic, given the risks, sacrifices and struggles involved in many migrants' journeys to Europe.
""For sure, it is not an easy thing to address the issue of return,"" he says. ""For us the important thing is to give people skills. Whether they can use them here or whether they are refused the right to stay, they are being given an opportunity, let's say a plus.
""It is clear though that, after the journeys they have made, the ideal solution is to stay here and that's why we believe giving people the skills to work and integrate is so important."""

In his first speech in office, Italy's new Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte called for the ""obligatory"" and ""automatic"" redistribution among EU member states of asylum seekers being processed in Italy.
Hardline interior minister Matteo Salvini said separately the proposed reforms would condemn Italy and other Mediterranean countries to continue bearing the burden of an unprecedented migration crisis for the 28-nation bloc.
EU leaders in December set an end-of-June deadline for an overhaul of the so-called Dublin rules to create a permanent mechanism to deal with migrants in the event of a new emergency. Under those rules, the countries where migrants first arrive must process their asylum requests. Italy, Greece and Spain are the main entry points to Europe.
EU cooperation deals with Turkey and Libya, the main transit countries, have helped to slow, at least for now, the flow of migrants to Europe since peak arrivals in 2015.
Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovakia have either refused outright or resisted taking in such refugees, citing threats to social cohesion. They have done so despite the European Commission, the EU executive, pushing through temporary quotas in 2015 as a way to ease the burden on frontline states Italy and Greece.

The changing face of the Mediterranean migrant crisis
Analysis: How EU founder member Italy went eurosceptic
Some 1.26 million people from war-torn Syria and other countries applied for asylum in EU countries in 2015, the peak of Europe's worst migration crisis since World War II.
Under an emergency plan, EU member countries agreed to relocate to other parts of the bloc 160,000 Syrians and other refugees from Italy and Greece within two years. Only 34,690 people have been relocated so far, however, as most migrants made their own way to Germany and other wealthy northern countries amid the chaos.
According to documents seen by AFP, Bulgaria calls for ""alleviating [the] burden from the front-line"" states and ""curbing secondary movements"" of asylum seekers who land in one EU country and travel to another. Eastern countries place a priority on stopping secondary movements, which caused so much chaos in recent years that some countries in Europe's passport-free Schengen zone even re-established border checks.
In a nod to Rome and Athens, the Bulgarian proposals call for the compulsory relocation of asylum seekers, but only as a last resort. At the outset of any new crisis, financial and other support are supposed to kick in automatically under the plan.
EU capitals like Budapest, which has spearheaded opposition to Muslim and other migrants, have stood firm against mandatory relocation. As a further sop to the eastern countries, people will be relocated only in

					09:17 CEST+02:00				",Malcolm Curtis,Ticino threatens closing Italy border to refugees ,"The head of the cantonal government of Ticino is warning that the border with Italy will have to be closed to refugees to stem the tide of asylum seekers entering Switzerland.
“If the influx of refugees from Italy continues, we will have to temporarily close the border,” Norman Gobbi, the Ticino government's president told NZZ am Sonntag.
“It's the only way for Switzerland to put pressure on other countries that do not respect their obligations,” Gobbi said.
He said the number of asylum seekers and illegal immigrants crossing the border from Italy had doubled from a year ago
Gobbi complaind that Swiss authorities “were doing work for Italy and the European Union, notably with the identification of migrants.”
He said that when its comes to asylum seekers, Ticino has become the “southern border of Germany”.
Gobbi suggested the pressure had only risen since France decided to close its border to refugees travelling from Italy.
But he was particularly critical of Italy for not honouring the Dublin Regulation, which requires that the first country in the EU where an asylum seeker arrives is responsible for dealing with his or her claim.
Since the beginning of the year more than 50,000 refugees have arrived in Italy after crossing the Mediterranean in boats.
From January to May 2015, Swiss border guards in Ticino have apprehended 3,150 people for unlawful stay in Switzerland, a spokesman for the border guards told NZZ am Sonntag.
Most of them came from the African countries of Eritrea, Somalia, Gambia, Nigeria and Senegal, as well as Kosovo.
The State Secretariat for Migration informed cantonal governments that the number of asylum seekers will continue to rise this year, NZZ am Sonntag said, citing a confidential document.
Over the summer, the level of monthly requests is expected to surpass 3,000.
“For this reason it cannot be excluded that in 2015 more than 30,000 people will apply for asylum,” the document reportedly says.
That's the highest level since 1999.
The overwhelming majority — 95 percent — of migrants arrive in Switzerland by train, according to Swiss border guards.
Many are deported to Italy, but “repatriation is a problem because Italian authorities are not prepared for it”, Gobbi said."

					09:01 CEST+02:00				",AFP,Survivor recalls 'terror' of shipwreck tragedy,"A survivor from an asylum seeker boat disaster on Thursday, which may have left more than 300 dead, speaks about tragedy off the Italian island of Lampedusa.
A raging fire on board the boat, screams of fear and the drop into the dark waters: Ali, one of the 155 traumatized survivors from Italy's refugee boat disaster, struggled to hold back the tears. ""We arrived near the coast at about three in the morning. We waited a long time, but no help came,"" the hollow-eyed 25-year-old told AFP, as he sat in an overcrowded refugee centre on Lampedusa island. ""We were trying to make a signal and the captain burned a T-shirt on the top of the boat,"" said Ali, wearing a garish green hand-me-down tracksuit. ""When the people saw the fire, they went to the other side and the ship lost its balance. A lot of persons sank down. The terror began,"" he said. Over 300 people are feared to have died after a boat carrying around 500 asylum seekers caught fire, capsized and sank on Thursday morning. ""I had to swim for five hours before rescue came. My family, a lot of friends were on that boat. I cannot speak of it, it is too painful,"" he said. Ali said he paid €1,000 to board the boat for Italy after a torturous journey across the Sahara from the dictatorship he was fleeing in Eritrea to Libya where he set off. Ali keeps to himself and has yet to make friends with others in the camp who are fleeing war and persecution - more than 1,000 in total including previous arrivals in a centre with only 250 beds. A parliamentary group that visited on Saturday described their living conditions as ""shameful"" and ""unacceptable for a civilised country"". The charity Save the Children has called on the government for the 228 children there - including 40 unaccompanied minors among the survivors of the disaster - to be evacuated immediately. Refugees could be seen on green benches under a tin roof or clustered under trees behind a wire fence with rubbish strewn all around and dirty mattresses and thermal blankets lying discarded. Songs in Arabic sounded out across the yard, where there were long queues to use the telephones as children bounced footballs off concrete walls or played with a sandy-coloured stray dog. Bare-foot toddlers in nappies watched their fathers sleeping and women in headdresses washed clothes with a bucket and hose. Mohammed, 53, moved his family out of Syria when the bombs began to fall around him and hoped to head to Switzerland but had to leave his loved ones in Egypt when it became clear he did not have enough money to pay for their crossing into Europe. ""I took a bus through the desert to Libya, a four-day journey full of fear. I suffered because I knew I had to go forward but I hated to leave my wife, two daughters and two sons behind. They are so young, they need their father,"" he said. ""We fled the danger in Syria, but I was treated so badly in Libya too, there seemed to be no escape. When I rang my family from here they were glad I survived but we do not know how I will get out and bring them here,"" he added. Grey-haired and tubby, Mohammed has been in the centre 11 days and relies heavily on the 24-hour medical service provided by on-site doctors. ""I am diabetic, which made the journey even more dangerous. When we set off from the Libyan coast I had to wade into the water up to my chin, with my medicine bag and documents in my mouth. It was terrifying to fear losing everything.""

					17:06 CEST+02:00				",The Local,Is a single German province more of a 'front line' on migration than Italy?,"As the Italian government pushes for the EU to share its burden of migration flows in the Mediterranean, a closer look reveals that one German province is already bearing a larger burden.
The EU's rules on asylum are dysfunctional, putting far too much strain on 'frontline states' such as Greece and Italy, most experts tell us. The so-called Dublin rules stipulate that asylum seekers have to apply for refugee status in the EU country in which they first arrive.
That should mean that the overwhelming majority of migrants apply for asylum in Greece or Italy, due to the fact that those countries are primary landing points for people crossing the Mediterranean.
But statistics on where migrants were living at the end of last year, first reported by Die Welt, show that no other EU state hosts a number of asylum seekers even comparable with Germany, where at the end of 2017 some 1.41 million refugees and asylum seekers resided.
READ ALSO: The refugee debate: just how ‘open' are Germany's borders?
France had the second-highest number of asylum seekers and refugees at 402,000, while in Italy the number was 355,000.
That means that the state of North Rhine-Westphalia alone, which is home to 433,236 refugees and asylum seekers, was hosting more people than any EU state outside Germany – including Italy. Meanwhile the capital Berlin is currently home to 83,000 refugees and asylum seekers, more than Greece.
The numbers do not include people who have had their asylum requests rejected. At the end of 2016 an estimated half a million people who had been turned down for asylum were still living in Germany.
Figures published by the European Commission back up the claim that Germany is the country that deals with the largest weight of the asylum flow. While Germany made 524,185 asylum decisions last year, according to Eurostat data, Italy made 78,235 and Greece made 24,510.
According to German daily Die Welt, this all goes to show that Germany has rarely enforced the Dublin rules over recent years, instead allowing asylum seekers to make their application in Germany.
“This comparison does not in any way show that Italy and Greece are not burdened. These heavily indebted countries don't have the means to handle the asylum flow like Germany. But the claim that Germany has left the coastal states on their own to handle the migration influx is simply wrong,” wrote Die Welt.

Chief Prosecutor Vincenzo Verzera will ask the judge to rule that the man be held in pre-trial custody in prison, Ansa reported.
The man was arrested on Sunday after the bodies of Victor Solano, 68, and his 70-year-old Spanish wife, Mercedes Ibanez, were found at their home near the Cara Mineo refugee centre, outside Catania, where the suspect had been staying.
Solano was found with his throat slit while his wife's body was found in the courtyard beneath their apartment. It is believed that she fell from the balcony.
Citing a judicial source, Ansa reported on Tuesday that an initial autopsy showed that Ibanez may have been raped.
The report is expected to be filed to prosecutors by the end of today, while a full autopsy report will be filed within 60 days.
The couple will be buried on Wednesday, Corriere reported.
The suspect was implicated in the double murder after a phone and laptop, allegedly belonging to the victims, were found in a bag he was carrying as he entered the refugee centre. He claimed he found the bag in the street.
Blood-stained trousers, thought to belong to the suspect, were also found in the garden of the couple's home.
The suspect was also allegedly wearing a T-Shirt belonging to Solano, which was recognized by the deceased man's daughter, at the time of his arrest.
His arrest flared the debate over migrants in Italy, with Matteo Salvini, the leader of the anti-immigration Northern League party, writing on Twitter and Facebook on Monday: “From what war was this guy escaping??? If he's guilty, jail for life, with HARD LABOUR!”
Other politicians, including Sicilian President Rosario Crocetta, have called for the centre in Mineo – the largest of such facilities in Europe – to be closed.
“It will never work...it's the wrong model,” Crocetta said.
“You can't put three to four thousand people - without prospects or ties to the territory - together in one place.”
Premier Matteo Renzi has so far stayed silent after the couple's daughter, Rosita Solano, blamed the government for the murders, saying it allowed “immigrants to come here and do what they want, even rob and kill us.”
On Tuesday, she told Corriere that neither the premier nor Angelino Alfano, Italy's Interior Minister, had even Tweeted a message of support.
“My parents didn't even merit a tweet,” she said.
“I want justice – not political controversy: Renzi come and speak to me, show your face...before the funeral. When he was nominated premier, I thought Italy would finally be worth something in Europe, instead...”"

					15:34 CEST+02:00				",Catherine Edwards,Migrants nearly as valuable to Italian economy as Fiat,"A new study reveals that foreign workers in Italy contribute almost as much to the national economy as Fiat - Italy's biggest car manufacturer and one of the country's largest companies.
More than 5 million foreigners live in Italy, as of January 1st 2016, making up 8.3 percent of the total population.
Between them, they fund the pensions of 640,000 Italians, according to a new report. This is particularly impressive since only 100,000 foreigners draw pensions themselves in Italy.
The report 'The economic impact of immigration' by the Leone Moressa Foundation, was presented to the Interior Ministry on Tuesday. Published annually, it measures the tax and social security contributions of migrants living in Italy, as well as their cost to the state.
In 2015, the new arrivals brought in over €7 billion in personal income tax and €11 billion in social security contributions.
In total, they contributed €126 billion to the national GDP, or 8.8 percent of the total, making them almost as valuable to the Italian economy as car manufacturer Fiat, which generates €136 billion each year.
The figure was up from last year, when the study calculated that immigrants brought in €123 billion.
As for their cost to the state, just 1.75 percent of public spending goes towards migrants; €15 billion in total. For comparison, Italy pays €70 billion in interest on debt each year, and spends €260 billion on pensions.
""Migration continues to bring benefits to the Italian system,"" the foundation noted, singling out pension contributions as ""one of the main benefits"".
Young migrants are an asset to ageing Italy
Most of the newcomers are young; 78.1 percent are of working age, compared to 63.2 percent of the Italian population as a whole.
And while Italy counts more than 16 million pensioners, only 100,000 of these are foreigners.
Italy also has the lowest birthrate in the EU, compounding the problem of an ageing population, and qualified youngsters are leaving the country in their droves. A study published last week warned of a ""brain drain"", noting that Italians aged 18-34 made up over a third of emigrants in 2015.
READ ALSO: Why Italy is facing a 'birth rate apocalypse'
Young, working migrants therefore provide a much needed boost to the Italian economy.
However, it wasn't all good news. The study also noted that two thirds of employed immigrants were working in low-skilled jobs, compared to around a third of Italian-born workers. Furthermore, households with at least one immigrant were much more likely to be living below the poverty line than native Italians."

The move comes after local officers complained to local police chief, Diego Peruga, that they could no longer carry out their jobs effectively due to their lack of foreign language skills.
The city, which is located in the mountains of central Sicily, sees thousands of foreign visitors and migrants pass through each year. But the local police struggle to provide them with support as they are unable to do simple things like provide people with directions in English.
After repeated requests for language lessons, Peruga broached the topic with city mayor, Giovanni Ruvolo.
Ruvolo had a brainwave: get some of the city's asylum seekers to lay on a 30-hour basic English course for 74 members of Caltanisetta's police force.
When the mayor asked them, they were all too happy to volunteer as teachers.
“I want to help people here,” Rahaman, an asylum seeker from Pakistan, told La Repubblica. “I used to be a teacher back home and so feel I have a lot to offer.""
Ruvolo hopes the scheme could play an important role in helping asylum seekers integrate into Italian life.
""It also provides them with the opportunity to give something back to the town which has welcomed them with open arms,"" Ruvolo told The Local.
""I also think it's a great way to show people that migrants can be a resource for the country,"" he said.
""Behind news stories of statistics and tragedies there are unique and talented people.""
Many of the forty people waiting for their claims to be processed at Caltanissetta's state-run Sprar refugee centre are fluent in English and already have experience teaching in a classroom environment.
The crash course, currently involves bi-weekly lessons from two different teachers.
“The students are making good progress. By far the most difficult part for me is explaining things to them in Italian because it's a language I'm still studying,” Rahaman explained.
But in spite of linguistic and cultural boundaries, the lessons have been a success.
""We hope to offer a second round of lessons between September and December and want to raise the number of teachers from two to four,"" Ruvolo added."

More than 750,000 people have received asylum in the European Union since 2008, with Germany and Sweden consistently taking in more asylum seekers than any other countries.
Germany took in 47,555 asylum seekers last year, 82 percent more than the year before. Sweden accepted 33,000 applicants, up 25 percent on 2013.
Italy approved just ten fewer applicants than France, which granted asylum to 20,640 people last year, a rise of 27 percent year on year.

Italy, Greece, Croatia and Malta might be sanctioned for flouting criteria laid down in the Dublin Convention, which stipulates that the EU state where an asylum seeker first enters is responsible for taking fingerprints and registering asylum applications, Rai News reported, citing diplomatic sources in Brussels.
A deal agreed among EU states in September to relocate refugees across Europe was dependent on countries including Italy and Greece, which have borne the brunt of arrivals by sea, setting up “hotspots” to swiftly process asylum requests.
But the bitterly contested plan has ground to a halt, with less than 150 reportedly leaving Italy over the past couple of months.
Some 80 refugees were supposed to leave the country each day as part of a plan that would see 40,000 relocated over two years.
The Sicilian port town of Pozzallo became the first official ""hotspot"" at the end of November, with new arrivals obliged to provide their fingerprints, or be taken to a detention centre to await expulsion from Italy.
One of the issues for Italy has been migrants' refusal to go through the identification process.
“They don't want to be here, otherwise they would have to stay in our country under the accords,” Interior Minister Angelino Alfano said during a TV interview in June.
Of the 122,000 migrants who arrived in Italy between January and September, only 80,000 agreed to be identified, according to figures from the Italian police.
The Dublin regulation also forces migrants to stay in the country where they submitted their application while it is being processed – which, in Italy especially, can take months, or even years.

Compared with the population of each EU state, the highest rate of registered first-time applicants was recorded in Germany (2,155 first-time applicants per million inhabitants) and Austria (1,619), ahead of Malta (904), Luxembourg (888), Sweden (790), Cyprus (749) and Hungary (693).
In contrast, the lowest rates were observed in Slovakia (three applicants per million inhabitants), Estonia (4), Romania (11), Lithuania (13), Portugal (14) and Latvia (16).
More than a third of first-time applicants came from Syria (36 percent), with more than 85 percent of the 102,400 Syrians who applied during the first quarter registering in Germany.
Iraq and Afghanistan were the second and third main countries of origin.
For Italy, the three main countries of origin among those who registered for asylum during the period were Pakistan (4,125), Nigeria (3,535) and Gambia (1,940).
During the first quarter of 2016, there were in total 565 first-time asylum applicants per million inhabitants in the EU as a whole, Eurostat said.
So far this year more than 48,000 people have been brought to the Italian coast after being pulled from boats trying to cross from Libya, according to the UN refugee agency."

					09:40 CEST+02:00				",AFP/The Local,Germany hoping for a breakthrough in migration talks with Italy and Greece,"German Interior Minister Horst Seehofer on Sunday said he hoped for a breakthrough this week in talks with Italy and Greece on taking back asylum-seekers already registered in those countries, as Berlin toughens its migration policies.
""The talks are proceeding in a good climate,"" Seehofer told public broadcaster ARD.
""But in the end, the heads of government may have to talk with each other again because of the complexity"" of the matter, he added, as well as saying he wanted ""clarity"" in the coming days about whether an agreement could be struck.
Little concrete progress has been made since a crunch EU summit in July; while Greece has signalled a willingness to take back some migrants, Italy's right-wing government is more resistent.
Italian Interior Minister Matteo Salvini, the leader of the far-right League party, has said his country expects to see more action to toughen the EU's external frontiers before agreeing to any migrant return deal.
Greece and Italy, who have borne the brunt of migrant arrivals in recent years, are also insisting that in return for taking back certain asylum-seekers, Germany should take in others.
But Seehofer stressed that the number of returns must not outweigh the number of new migrants taken in.
""We can't sign up to that, the German people wouldn't understand if we took in more refugees than we sent back,"" he told ARD.
Former Bavarian premier Seehofer has long been one of the fiercest critics of German Chancellor Angela Merkel's decision to open the country's borders to those fleeing conflict, persecution and poverty at the height of the migrant crisis in 2015.
Germany has since taken in over a million asylum-seekers, fuelling the rise of the far-right, anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany (AfD) party.
Seehofer, who heads Merkel's more traditional CSU sister party, recently threatened to turn back migrants at Germany's borders if they had already made asylum requests in other EU countries.
Fearing the domino-effect such unilateral action would unleash, Merkel instead pushed for a wider European Union response that includes migrant return deals with frontline states like Greece and Italy. Now, Seehofer has threatened to press on with his plans if no bilateral agreements are in place by early August.

At least that's if Massimo Osanna, the Archaeological Superintendent of Pompeii, gets his way.
Speaking at an event inside the ancient ruins on Saturday, Osanna told politicians and reporters that he hoped the government would consider putting the some of country's asylum seekers to work within the cultural sphere.
“They already receive a daily rate from the government without being employed in any field,” Il Mattino reported the archaeologist as saying.
In 2015, Italy saw some 121,000 migrants arrive on its shores and has seen a further 50,000 land since the beginning of the year.
A significant proportion of all arrivals end up claiming political asylum in Italy, a process that usually takes between 12 and 18 months.
While asylum claims are processed, migrants cannot work, but they receive a daily allowance of €2.50 from the government and are given free housing, healthcare, education and training.
“At the moment they are paid to be inactive. Why not employ them at some of our cultural sites?” Osanna asked.
The cost of maintaining Italy's huge cultural and historical heritage is a headache for the government, which struggles to find the millions needed to fund a never-ending stream of maintenance and restoration works.
Despite being the country's most popular historical site with three million annual visitors, Pompeii also struggles for cash.
Last year, the ruins even turned to crowdfunding to try and find the €53,000 needed to finance the restoration of a bedroom, the walls of which contain an ancient graffito perhaps scrawled by the second wife of Julius Caesar.
Osanna feels working refugees could provide a great service for Italy's cultural sites and free up money for other things.
“Generally, refugees could carry out general work such as clearing rubbish and gardening,” Osanna said, adding that refugees and migrants would not just be performing basic services.
“Among the arrivals there are architects, engineers and even archaeologists who hail from extremely cultural cities but have unfortunately been forced to flee.”"

					17:24 CET+01:00				",The Local,UK to probe Italy migrant mistreatment claims,"Claims by a group of asylum seekers that they suffered mistreatment in Italy must be investigated before they face deportation from the UK, the country's Supreme Court has ruled.
The three Eritreans and one Iranian claimed that they suffered “inhuman” treatment in Italy, including being raped, and fear further mistreatment if they are sent back. The group was due to be deported because, under European law, they should have stayed in Italy to seek asylum, as this was their point of entry into the EU. But the UK’s Supreme Court on Wednesday challenged this earlier decision, arguing that Italy should not necessarily be deemed a safe country for asylum seekers. It is not a prerequisite for Italy to have ""systematically breached"" asylum seekers' human rights, the Supreme Court said, but despite this the UK courts must examine their individual claims of mistreatment before deporting them. Two of the Eritreans are women, who said that they were repeatedly raped in Italy, leaving one of them suicidal at the thought of being forcibly sent back. They and the Eritrean man claim they were left homeless and destitute in the country. The Iranian man argued that he is in need of treatment for torture inflicted while a political prisoner in his own country, which he said would be unavailable in Italy. The group’s case will now be sent to the UK’s Administrative Court, a process which could take some months. Charlie Bagnall, a lawyer representing the Eritrean man, told The Local that the British court will need to examine their claims of mistreatment within the broader context of the Italian immigration system.
“The court isn’t there to pronounce on the Italian system, but evidence of the overall picture is going to come into it as part of the claim about fearing mistreatment,” Bagnall said. He advocated a country “fact-finding mission” by the UK’s Immigration and Asylum Tribunal, to better assess future claims of mistreatment in Italy. He said that getting a better picture of the issues affecting migrants in Italy would ""set a framework for individual claims to be looked at"". ""This is the best means to try to have a more efficient system [and] the sooner that happens with Italy, the better,” Bagnall told The Local. Italy is currently struggling to cope with the number of migrants arriving on its shores. Last year, around 43,000 people arrived in the country by boat, an increase of 325 percent on 2012. Only recently emerging from recession, Italy lacks the financial resources to provide adequate facilities for asylum seekers, who often spend months living in overcrowded immigration centres. In December, a national TV channel broadcast footage of asylum seekers in the island of Lampedusa stripping to be hosed down with disinfectant, like in a “concentration camp” according to Mayor Giusi Nicolini. The Italian government promptly moved the migrants out of the centre and the EU demanded an inquiry into the way they were treated. Don't miss a story about Italy - Join us on Facebook and Twitter."

""We must ask the municipalities to apply our directive and make migrants work for free... Rather than leave them with nothing to do, they should make them work,"" Angelino Alfano said, according to the Italian media.
The statement came amid rising tensions in Italy over a massive influx of migrants and people fleeing war, who risked their lives and paid exorbitant sums to smugglers to sail on rickety, overcrowded boats across the Mediterranean to the Italian coast.
While the deaths of thousands of migrants at sea have raised a global outcry, many in Italy feel they have shouldered enough of the burden, and the government has repeatedly called for more EU help.
The interior ministry's civil and immigration rights chief Mario Morcone said asylum seekers working for ""the public good"", for example on environmental projects, would only need their insurance covered.
""The idea is to create a better rapport, and more acceptance"" in society, Morcone said on television.
Migrants who are not seeking asylum tend to quickly leave the reception centres where they are housed on arrival, using clandestine routes to travel to other European countries where they have relatives or better work prospects.
As such, the ministry's decision refers to asylum seekers, whose claims can take up to two years to be processed.
Until they are recognized as refugees, asylum seekers do not have the right to work in Italy.
More than 9,000 new migrants have arrived in Italy in the past week. They add to 84,000 people already living in the reception centres, Morcone told a parliamentary commission.
On Wednesday, the northwestern region of Val d'Aoste became the first in Italy to refuse to welcome more migrants."

					12:08 CEST+02:00				", The Local,Amnesty fears for child migrants at Italian border,"Amnesty International has asked the Swiss federal government to investigate reports that child migrants arriving at the Swiss-Italian border are being prevented from joining family in Switzerland.
For the past few weeks the Italian city of Como has seen hundreds of migrants camped out by its rail station after being sent back from the Swiss border at Chiasso, in the canton of Ticino.
If refugees apply for asylum when they arrive at the Swiss border they are allowed to stay and will be registered as an asylum seeker in Switzerland.
But many don't want to, wishing instead to travel through Switzerland and apply for asylum in another country, such as Germany.
Applying EU rules, Switzerland is sending those people back to the country they travelled from, in this case Italy.
But this strict adherence to the rules has not impressed Italy, with Como officials saying in July that the Swiss stance was turning the city into “an open-air refugee centre”.
Now the Swiss branch of Amnesty International has expressed concern after hearing reports that children were being turned back from the Swiss border.
“We are concerned about reports from minors who tell us they have been sent back to Italy from the Swiss border and therefore prevented from joining relatives in Switzerland,” the organization said in a statement obtained by The Local.
“We are asking for clarity from the Swiss authorities regarding the practice of sending back minors to Italy.”
But the Swiss authorities stressed that the rules haven't changed, and that any migrant has the right to request asylum at the Swiss border, reported news agencies on Thursday.
Martin Reichlin of the Swiss migration office (SEM) told news agencies that any child arriving at the border to join family members in Switzerland would be taken into the care of the SEM.
Speaking to The Local on Thursday, a spokesman for Amnesty International said they were “monitoring the situation closely” but “cannot make further comments in this volatile situation”.
Quoting figures from the Swiss border guards office, news agencies said 3,560 people were sent back from Switzerland to Italy in July alone.
Speaking to Swiss paper 24 Heures, MP Cesla Amarelle said Switzerland found itself “stuck in the middle”.
“Italy can't welcome all the migrants that reach its coasts and Germany has specifically asked Switzerland to not become an open corridor, as Austria has done.”
However, though the situation in Como “is not Calais”, it shouldn't be allowed to get worse and Switzerland should work with Italy to avoid that happening, she said."

Now Eyube has been given his chance to prove to the world that his self confidence is justified.
Eight months after he landed in Italy, the 34-year-old is one of the stars of a new production that has brought the epic drama of migrants' journeys from Africa to Europe, across the Sahara and the Mediterranean, to the Italian stage.
Asylum-seekers make up 20 of the 30-strong cast of ""Sabbia"" (Sand), an original piece conceived by director Riccardo Vannuccini that emerged from a six-month theatre workshop run by the ArteStudio company in the Castelnuovo di Porto reception centre on the outskirts of Rome.
Sabbia had its first two showings at the weekend in Rome's prestigious Teatro Argentina and there are plans to take it around a country grappling with the pressures and polemics generated by the arrival of unprecedented numbers of migrants on its southern shores.
Eyube, like nearly all the others in the Castelnuovo centre, arrived there after being plucked from a floundering people-smugglers' boat in the Mediterranean.
He grabbed the chance of working with ArteStudio, a company thatspecialises in producing theatre in war zones and prisons and involving displaced people, the disabled and torture victims.
""I never had the opportunity to try theatre or anything like that before,"" Eyube said, explaining how preparing for Sabbia had allowed him to offset the tedium of endless days spent waiting for news on the progress of his application to stay permanently in Italy.
""I needed something to keep me moving. A man cannot live only sleeping and eating, sleeping and eating,"" he said in a break from rehearsals.
His role involves delivering the ""To be or not to be,"" soliloquy from Shakespeare's ""Hamlet"" in his rich baritone voice. T.S. Eliot's epic poem ""The Waste Land"" and the paintings of Jackson Pollock are also referenced in the contemporary production.
'Grace of God'
Director Vannuccini's CV includes a piece called ""Al Hodood"" that was produced in Jordan with the help of refugees from neighbouring Syria and a production of ""Hamlet"" in Hebron, in the Palestinian territories.
He says his latest work is not trying to make any particular point about Italy's migration crisis, instead framing his objective as a greater understanding of the forces driving it.
""This year there will be 200,000 people arriving in Italy, in the coming years it could be a million. It is an epochal event, both for those fleeing and for those at the receiving end.""
Working with the young Africans, he said, had been joyful despite their total absence of performance experience.
""There was some diffidence at first but what we do is not literary theatre, it is more a theatre of action,"" he explained. ""Our approach, is similar to that in sport, it is about creating a team. And then here is a lot of fun and friendship.""
For Ebuye and the other asylum-seekers in the cast, remembering lines and stage marks help occupy minds that otherwise would be filled with anxiety over the future or haunting memories of the recent past.
""I really don't want to talk about the journey,"" said Ebuye. ""I know what I have passed through and I know what I have seen.""
""Finding myself here, I am so happy because sometimes when I watch TV I see people in the sea, dead. I jump around because it is the grace of God.""
For Farba Mangane, 22, from Senegal, the mental scars from being forced onto a boat off Libya having never seen the sea prior to that day have healed slowly.
He was so traumatised he has only just recovered the ability to urinate without medication 13 months later.
""(In the centre) I think so much,"" he said. ""Am I going to get papers, am I going to have any money?"" he said. ""But since we started this theatre my heart has begun to relax."""

Syrians fleeing the ongoing war in their country accounted for 122,790 of the applications registered in Europe last year. But they remain a tiny fraction of more than 3.9 million Syrians registered by the UN refugee agency, with the majority sheltering in countries bordering the conflict.
Within Italy the largest group of asylum-seekers last year hailed from Nigeria (10,135), where Boko Haram militants have led a violent campaign against citizens. The second-largest group (9,790) came from Mali, where French troops intervened in 2013 to combat Islamists taking over territory in the country.

Misa Chiavari, herself a mother of four, is one of many Italians who have quietly given a home to refugees over the years, La Repubblica reported.
“I welcomed desperate migrants, and today they are happy. They gave me joy,” she told the newspaper.
“I’m not looking for publicity, I just want to let people know that responding to the appeal for solidarity is a wonderful experience.”
Her story comes after Pope Francis on Sunday took his appeal against “the globalization of indifference” forward by asking every parish in Europe to open its doors to a refugee family, adding that the Vatican would lead by example.
That appeal was buoyed by last week’s publication of the shocking image of a drowned Syrian toddler on a Turkish beach.
Citing official sources, Ansa reported on Tuesday that Italy’s interior ministry had issued a circular to regional prefects asking them to host another 20,000 refugees, a request that is likely to stir up more tension in areas like Veneto and Lombardy, which have strongly opposed taking in more.
Chiavari described the young Iraqi and Afghans she hosted as her “extended family”.
She met them while teaching Italian to asylum seekers at the Astalli centre, which is run by the Jesuit Refugee Service (JRS) in Rome.
Two of the refugees she hosted – Ali and Ismet - were sleeping rough at the capital’s Ostiense station.
“In the winter, along with some other teachers, I went to the station and brought them to my home. There was no trouble and I wasn’t fearful. In fact, they were more afraid of me. It took time to build trust and for them to tell me their stories.”
She said both men now have families and a job – one opened a pizzeria and the other became a carpenter.
“They come to see me, they bring their children, they call me mum,” she added.
“I got out of this experience far more than I put in.”
Refugee care costs the government up to €800 million per year, as it offers private individuals, companies and non-profit organizations up to €35 a day per person to host them.
From that figure, hosts must give a daily pocket money allowance of €2.50 each. Amici dei Bambini, a non-profit organization, said last week that 300 families had responded to a recent appeal for refugee hosts.
Hoteliers across the country have also become hosts, but not without staunch criticism from the anti-immigrant Northern League party.
Matteo Salvini, the party's leader, denounced those who had “to wait for landings at Lampedusa” in order to fill their hotel rooms.
Meanwhile, the owner of a hotel near Bergamo told police late last month that his 72 guests had received threats.
A day later, a Muslim mayor in the Tuscan seaside community of Monte Argentario provoked an outcry after refusing to accept any refugees, arguing that the town ""doesn't have the facilities"".

of asylum seekers who land on their shores - and they say they have had enough.
The locals of the remote fishing community on Lampedusa island rush to help every time but their patience is wearing thin as they see government funds allocated to migrants and not to them. ""Here it's the dead that keep the economy going,"" said Silvana Martelli, a waitress, as divers fished out bodies after a shipwreck in which over 300 African refugees are feared to have died. ""It doesn't feel like our island anymore. There's money to take care of the immigrants while the schools fall apart and rubbish piles up,"" she said. As European ministers discuss the refugee crisis at talks in Luxembourg on Tuesday, this type of local resentment is a concern for governments that see the problem before them but do not want to risk being seen as a soft touch on immigration. With a resident population of just a few thousand people, Lampedusans are sometimes outnumbered by the new arrivals before they are transferred to asylum centres on the Italian mainland. In a corner of the harbour, the blue and red fishing boats daubed in Arabic script that are used for the landings lie discarded - a poignant reminder of the relentless human drama. ""This island has the most beautiful beaches in the world but it has become a giant cemetery for the drowned,"" said 57-year-old fisherman Filippo Bruno. ""Europe has to get its act together and do something before this happens again. And it will happen again,"" he said as he gazed out to sea. There is no more space at the local cemetery, where the last plots have been taken up by migrants who have perished in past shipwrecks. At the school, children this week have made a series of heartbreaking drawings of Thursday's disaster, with immigrants seen struggling to stay afloat as their ship sinks into the sea in flames. There is sympathy for the refugees' plight but the economic crisis has also fuelled ill will against Europe's broken-down immigration system and led to accusations of preferential treatment for migrants. Restaurant owner Ornella Gervasi fumed as she handed out plates of pasta to refugees. ""We can't abandon these poor souls,"" she said. ""But winter is coming and when rough seas mean the ferry cannot get through, they have provisions flown in, while we run out of the basic necessities. It does tend to brew resentment."" Lampedusa, which measures just 20 square kilometres (7.7 square miles), is Italy's southernmost point and is closer to North Africa than to the rest of the country. Even the shipping-in of empty coffins for the bodies fished from the sea has prompted angry reactions from those who said they have had loved ones die on the mainland and been forced to spend thousands of euros to bring them home. ""We don't have the facilities here to treat many illnesses. My father had to go on a dialysis machine so we took him to a hospital in Rome. He died and we spent every last cent in bringing him back,"" Ornella's sister Romina said.
Hotel owner Angela Lombardo echoed the frustration. ""We are culturally poor. There are no libraries, no bookshops, our children are ignorant,"" she said. ""The bible says care for your family before looking after your neighbour. The immigrants cannot come first!"" she said. Despite the resentment on this outcrop, Lampedusans have come out time and time again to rescue drowning asylum seekers from their waters and offer succour to the living with blankets, meals, clothes and toys for the children. Many fishermen have also aided those in peril. But as he rinsed his fishing nets, Calosero Spalma said he was afraid of a tough Italian law against those seen as assisting irregular migrants. ""Several times I've seen boats with immigrants in trouble and I've turned around and sailed off,"" he said. ""If they confiscated my boat, I couldn't work and my family would pay the price. I couldn't risk that. ""I feel for the poor people fleeing wars and horrors, but what can I do?"""

""I don't think there are tensions between us... sometimes ministers can let themselves go with statements, it's like engaged couples who have been together a long time,"" Prime Minister Renzi quipped during a joint press conference in Milan.
The leaders were meeting ahead of a European summit on June 25th and 26th which is expected to focus on the relocation and resettlement of asylum seekers and return policies for would-be economic migrants.
Italy, which has seen almost 60,000 migrants arrive this year, has been struggling to accommodate asylum seekers, and the tightening of controls at the French border has left many sleeping rough in the country's main train stations.
Another 740 boat migrants were brought to safety in Calabria in southern Italy on Sunday.
Renzi sounded a firm ""no to hysteria"", saying the numbers so far were comparable to last year, but also called for greater European cooperation, saying ""no also to selfishness"".
The situation at the frontier town of Ventimiglia, where French police have been stopping migrants from crossing into France, has sparked not only protests but also a heated exchange between the countries' interior ministers.
""The problem is not just in Ventimiglia... it's Europe's problem,"" Renzi said.
Hollande stressed the border had not been closed, but strict controls were being carried out on immigrants hoping to pass into Europe via France after washing up on Italy's shores on rickety boats from Libya.
""We are applying the rules,"" he said in reference to the Dublin agreement which obliges migrants to apply for asylum in the European country in which they first set foot.
Many migrants hope to avoid doing so as they don't want to stay in recession-hit Italy but hope to reach countries further north with better job prospects.
Hollande agreed that Rome cannot ""bear the burden for the others,"" indicating that France was ready to help with registering migrants as part of a EU plan to provide shelter to those in need and quickly repatriate economic migrants."

Despite the decrease in immigration, permanent immigration to Italy remains high, with foreign residents accounting for eight percent of the entire registered population in 2011, the OECD's 2013 International Migration Outlook report found, citing the 2011 Census. The number of asylum seekers in the country rose to more than 34,000 in 2011 from 10,000 in 2010 in the wake of the 'Arab Spring', with the main countries of origin being Tunisia and Libya. However, out of 24,100 requests for asylum, only 30 percent had a positive outcome. The majority of those who received work permits in 2011 came from Morocco (12,400), India (11,200) and China (10,300). A total of 15,200 visas for seasonal work were granted in the same year, led by workers from India and Morocco. Meanwhile, 2,000 permits were given for highly-skilled workers or those doing research-based work, with US citizens being the main recipients.
Asylum seekers from north Africa continue to arrive on Italy's coasts, with a total of 4,319 landing in the first five months of this year, according to figures from Italy's Interior Ministry. During the same period, 13,304 were reported to have been repatriated. In April, Italy's coastguard rescued 213 migrants packed onto two large dinghies off the southern island of Lampedusa. Italy’s President Giorgio Napolitano yesterday called on the government to push ahead with immigration reforms, according to Italian press reports. Napolitano is reported to have said that Italy needs to “take stock of the immigration and asylum situation and carefully consider the limitations of our laws and practices surrounding citizenship.”"

To complicate matters further, Britain said on Tuesday it won't support the planned EU search and rescue operation, arguing it will create an unintended ""pull factor"" for more migrants to attempt the dangerous sea crossings, The combined efforts of the Italian navy and coast guard have saved over 150,000 men, women and children attempting the perilous crossing from the coasts of North Africa this year so far. But with the introduction of EU border agency Frontex's ""Triton"" mission, it is not clear whether Italy's ""Mare Nostrum"" rescue mission - a large-scale deployment launched a year ago after two deadly shipwrecks - will be scaled back or closed down entirely. ""Mare Nostrum is being wound up. There will be a formal decision during one of the next cabinet meetings,"" Deputy Prime Minister and Interior Minister Angelino Alfano said recently. But Alfano has also insisted the two operations are ""totally distinct"", as Triton will remain within European territorial waters, while Mare Nostrum rescues people in floundering boats and overcrowded dinghies from the Strait of Sicily to the coast of Libya. Interior Ministry Undersecretary Domenico Manzione this month said Mare Nostrum ""will continue until further notice. For now, nothing changes."" Aid agencies have warned the number of deaths in the Mediterranean - which have topped 3,300 so far this year - may rise if Italy cuts the chord. A total of 32 boats have taken part in the Mare Nostrum mission, supported by two submarines as well as planes and helicopters, according to navy figures. On average, a total of 900 men and women are manning the decks daily and pick up an average of 400 people every 24 hours - tripling the number of arrivals in 2013. Their work has also led to the arrest of 351 human traffickers since the mission began. Half of those rescued are asylum seekers from Syria and Eritrea, the rest come from Gambia, Ghana, Mali, Nigeria, the Palestinian territories or Somalia.
Shifting the burden Despite winning high praise from the UN's refugee agency, Mare Nostrum has drawn criticism both at home and in Europe from those who say it is ferrying in immigrants rather than dissuading them from coming. The planned EU operation will do the same thing, creating ""an unintended pull factor, encouraging more migrants to attempt the dangerous sea crossing and thereby leading to more tragic and unnecessary deaths,"" according to British foreign office minister Joyce Anelay. London's position is to focus on ""countries of origin and transit"" and tackle people smugglers instead, she added. Policing the coast also comes at a monetary cost and the Italian government, struggling to stave off a third recession in six years, is increasingly unwilling to shell out the €9.0 million ($11.4 million) a month needed. Triton's budget is more modest, coming in at €3.0 million a month, with eight European Union countries pledging planes and boats for the operation. Other countries will send teams to help Italy with the new arrivals - in particular with registering fingerprints, amid concerns Italy is letting too many migrants slip through the net and make it to other countries, shifting the burden to other national asylum seeker systems. The majority of would-be refugees do not want to stay in Italy. The country registered 26,620 requests for asylum in 2013 - just 6.0 percent of the number of requests made across the European Union. In the same period, 125,000 requests were made in Germany, 65,000 in France and 55,000 in Sweden. Catholic charity Caritas, Save the Children and the UNHCR have all insisted that, with a lack of commitment in Europe to finding legal ways for asylum seekers to escape their homelands, Italy cannot simply stop saving boat migrants. In a bid to reassure critics, on October 16th Alfano said that ""even after Mare Nostrum winds up, Italy will continue search and rescue missions at sea."""

Alfano was speaking at an event in Ostia, near Rome, in response to criticism from Monsignor Nunzio Galantino, the general secretary of the Italian Bishops Conference, of Italy’s proposal to start fingerprinting migrants crossing the Mediterranean as soon as they are picked up by rescue boats.
The so-called ‘floating hotspots’ “are a bad copy of detention centres”, Galantino told La Repubblica, adding that while on a ship, the right for migrants to seek asylum would not be ensured.
Italy and Greece have borne the brunt of Europe’s refugee crisis, with 46,473 people landing on Italy’s shores since the start of the year.
Some 13,000 were rescued by the Italian navy, coast guard and EU vessels in several shipwrecks last week, while at least 1,000 are feared dead.
A joint report published by Europol and Interpol last month said there were around 800,000 migrants in Libya waiting to attempt the journey across the Mediterranean.
Meanwhile, an EU plan devised last September to move 120,000 asylum seekers from Italy and Greece to elsewhere in the EU has fallen by the wayside.
“I understand Galantino’s words, as a bishop, but I'm the interior minister and have a duty to ensure that laws are respect,” Alfano was quoted by Ansa as saying.
“We’re the champions of the world when it comes to being humanitarian and welcoming. We have a big heart, but we can’t welcome everyone.”
Galantino also said the migrant deaths were ""a slap in the face to European democracy” and slammed the EU for failing to create “a humanitarian corridor, provided for by international law, towards countries willing to host migrants, in order to encourage safe passage and avoid violence, exploitation and deaths""."

A baby girl born on board the Italian navy patrol ship Bettica was among more than 3,000 asylum seekers and migrants landed at ports in the south of mainland Italy and on the islands of Lampedusa and Sicily.
The baby's mother had gone into labour just before leaving Libya aboard one of four barely seaworthy boats whose occupants were rescued by the Bettica.
Mother and baby were transferred to hospital on arrival but were both reported to be doing well, the navy said.
Not everyone was so lucky, at least ten migrants died, adding to an estimated total of more than 1,750 people who have perished in the waters between Libya and Italy since the start of this year.
This weekend's surge in the number of boats leaving Libya was put down to the fine weather and calm sea conditions and will have confirmed the fears of Italian officials who anticipate a record number of arrivals on their southern shores between now and September.
Last year's total of 170,000 was already unprecedented and current trends point to that figure being exceeded in 2015.
Among the ships involved in rescue ops at the weekend was the Malta-based M.Y. Phoenix, run jointly by private body Migrant Offshore Aid Station and Medecins Sans Frontieres/Doctors Without Borders.
The Phoenix, on its first mission of the year, was involved in the rescue of more than 470 people between Saturday and Monday morning, including several pregnant women and babies and a total of 45 children.
Christopher Catrambone, the American philanthropist who co-founded Moas with his wife Regina, said he had been shocked by the condition of the people they discovered packed onto a fishing boat they assisted on Sunday afternoon.
""The people were packed in so tightly that their legs had cramped and they struggled to move as we rescued them,"" he said.
MSF doctors treated migrants suffering from injuries sustained during beatings by people smugglers and others suffering from conditions including diabetes, dehydration and skin infections, as well as carrying out checks on the pregnant women.
MSF's Will Turner added: ""The boat was absolutely crammed full. As the men, women and children we rescued curled up under blankets to sleep, there wasn't a centimetre to spare. The scale of this crisis is just heartbreaking. I wish we could do more.""
Australia-EU talks
The migrants landed in southern Italy will quickly be dispersed to reception centres across the country pending decisions on their future.
Aid agencies say a large number of those attempting the Mediterranean crossing have legitimate claims to asylum in Europe as they are fleeing conflict or repression in places including Syria and Eritrea.
In a rare example of conflict-wracked Libya attempting to stem the migrant flow, five boats which set off at the weekend were intercepted by the Libyan coastguard and sent to the city of Misrata, home to a detention centre for migrants.
Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott meanwhile revealed that his officials were talking to European Union counterparts about how to stop the flow of boats.
However, the European Commission, the executive of the 28-nation EU, said that it was not aware of such talks and that Brussels would never adopt Australia's model of turning back these boats.
Australia has successfully stopped asylum-seeker boats from reaching the continent by deploying its navy to turn them back, effectively deterring other would-be migrants.
The policy has proved controversial however with critics accusing the government of ignoring its international obligations on asylum and other human rights.
People smugglers have taken advantage of the chaos gripping Libya since the 2011 uprising that toppled dictator Moamer Kadhafi.
On April 19th, some 750 migrants were killed when their trawler sank between Libya and southern Italy, sparking global outrage and demands for action.
Four days later EU leaders tripled the bloc's budget for patrols off Libya.
EU leaders are now seeking UN Security Council approval for military action against smugglers.
But rights groups have criticised Europe for focusing on patrols rather than providing asylum seekers with legal avenues to seek refuge."

As the migrant influx continues in Italy's south, concern has mounted over the increasing number of people arriving from Slovenia, which is part of the Schengen area, with between 300 and 400 arriving each week, Corriere della Sera reported.
The number has grown substantially since northern European countries, notably Sweden and Denmark, took the decision to close their borders late last year, with government sources telling the newspaper that the Italian goverment is considering stepping up controls along the border with Slovenia.
As part of the stricter controls, police would be dispatched to carry out checks along road and rail border crossings into Italy, Corriere reported.
If enacted, the move would represent another blow for the controversial Schengen agreement, which allows for the free movement of people between 26 European countries without the need for passport and border controls.
“We risk paying serious consequences,"" Interior Minister Angelino Alfano said.
""Many other states don't register all of the migrants who arrive and yet we [Italy] are the ones who get sanctioned for it.”
Alfano was referring to possible sanctions against Italy, Greece and Malta for flouting criteria laid down by the EU regarding the registration of asylum seekers.
Under current EU rules, asylum seekers must be registered, identified and fingerprinted in the first EU country they arrive in.
As well as rules governing registration being flouted, a pact announced in September that was supposed to see thousands of asylum seekers in Italy relocated to other EU countries has so far flagged.
The pact stipulated that some 80 migrants would be relocated each day until a total of 50,000 had been moved on. But after three months just 190 had been relocated with a further 50 expected to follow by January 15th."

Italy was wrong to turn away the 32 Afghans, two Sudanese and one Eritrean boat migrants who were smuggled into the country in 2008 and 2009, the Strasbourg-based court ruled. The migrants arrived in the Italian ports of Bari, Ancona and Venice, after boarding boats in Patras, but were immediately sent back to Greece by Italian border police. “By returning these applicants to Greece, [Italy] had exposed them to the risks arising from the shortcomings in that country’s asylum procedure,” the court said in its judgement. From Greece the Afghans risked being returned to their home country, “where they were likely to be subjected to ill-treatment,” the court said. SEE ALSO: Life in Italy is not how I thought it would be' Since being sent back to Greece at least one of the group has been returned to Afghanistan, while a number of others have successfully travelled to other EU countries and at least one has been granted refugee status in Italy.
In its ruling the European court also slammed the Italian authorities for failing to grant those arriving in Ancona access to the asylum procedure. In the majority of cases Italy instead passed boat migrants to ferry captains headed for Greece, depriving the potential asylum-seekers “of any procedural and substantive rights”. Under European law asylum-seekers should be returned to the country of arrival in the EU, but the court on Tuesday said this could not be used as a justification for depriving people of their rights.

State media in the tiny Horn of Africa nation made no mention of the Eritrean nationals who perished last Thursday near the southern island of Lampedusa. Their boat caught fire in the worst recent migrant disaster in the Mediterranean. That came as no surprise from a country where former rebel leader turned president Issaias Afeworki has ruled with an iron fist for two decades, prompting a steady exodus of refugees. The country ranked last below North Korea in a global survey on press freedom by media watchdog Reporters Without Borders (RSF). According to the United Nations, about 3,000 people flee Eritrea every month. But for staffers at Radio Erena, an independent radio station set up in 2009 with backing from RSF, covering the tragedy was ""almost a personal mission,"" said its chief Biniam Simon. In a country of just five million people, he said, ""the loss of 200 to 300 lives could potentially affect anybody: the victims could be your neighbour, your colleague."" Biniam said the radio station, which ran survivor accounts after the shipwreck, caused a ""wave of gloom in Asmara,"" the Eritrean capital. The broadcaster was scathing of the manner in which the shipwreck, which has only left 155 survivors, was covered by both Eritrean and Western media. He suggested the Eritrean media's ""shameful coverage"" was due to the fact emigres are viewed as traitors by the government. ""They spoke of 'immigrants from Eastern Africa who were illegally crossing the sea' without saying where they came from,"" Biniam said. ""It was just to discourage others aspiring to leave,"" added the former Eritrean state television presenter, who decided not to return to his country after a work visit to Japan in 2006. Despite the silence in the state-run media, Eritrean Foreign Minister Osman Saleh Mohammed has offered his condolences to the families of the victims, although he did so from New York. Mass conscription and forced labour Biniam charged that Western media outfits had been ""improper"" in their reporting. ""They speak of illegal immigrants but the Eritreans are asylum-seekers who have no other choice but to leave their country,"" he said.
Eritrea, which broke away from Ethiopia in 1991 after a brutal 30-year independence struggle, has consistently raised fears domestically that Addis Ababa is scheming to re-take the country. This has allowed the government to conscript most adults into the army or force them to perform compulsory labour. Mass national service, introduced in 2004, can last decades and military police prowl the streets to round up those shirking service. ""Young men and women are sent to work on big national construction sites with almost no pay and this can last up to age 40 or 50, unless they become invalid before then,"" said journalist Leonard Vincent, the author of a book on Eritrea. Thousands have fled to neighbouring Sudan or Ethiopia despite a reported shoot-to-kill policy by border patrols, with families of those left behind risking being punished by crippling fines or imprisonment. To make things worse, the economy has stagnated and rumours have grown of Issaias's heavy drinking, furious temper and shouting fits at cowed officials. Although nominally under civilian rule, Eritrea under Issaias has been carved up into zones of control by army generals, who run a flourishing networks of corrupt businesses and cream off lucrative profits. The Lampedusa tragedy has sparked shock across Europe and highlighted the European Union's flawed asylum policy. Italy - which has seen some 30,000 migrants landing this year mainly from Eritrea, Somalia and Syria - wants a change in EU rules that force migrants to remain in their country of first arrival while their asylum application is being processed. But northern European states are opposed to Rome's argument that this puts an extra burden on the crisis-hit southern states. They say they do their share by taking in more refugees than southern Europe once asylum is granted. Despite the emotion the latest deaths provoked in Europe, Biniam fears ""it will not change anything as the problem is not being treated at source""."

Many of them landed on the Italian island of Lampedusa, where twin shipwreck tragedies this month killed at least 400 migrants, and have since gradually made their way up the peninsula. ""We left Homs five months ago,"" said a 29-year-old woman, who is camping out with her husband, 35, a construction business owner from the devastated Syrian city, and their two daughters, 10 and 12. ""We passed through Jordan, Egypt and Libya where we lived for three months,"" she said, speaking to AFP through an interpreter in Arabic. ""We arrived on Lampedusa on October 3rd"" - the same day that at least 364 fellow asylum seekers from Eritrea and Somalia on a different boat drowned. One woman who arrived at the station with her husband gave birth on the boat to Lampedusa. The family have been put in temporary housing in Milan. Local charities have rushed to help, distributing hot food at meal times and providing clothes and blankets. Milan city hall on Thursday set up a special ""crisis unit"" to deal with the situation. ""The problem is exploding here at the central station,"" Alberto Sinigallia, the head of one of the charities, Fondazione Progetto Arca, told AFP. ""The influx started about a fortnight ago. Until the day before yesterday, it was only 30-40 people arriving per day. They spent the night here and left the next day,"" Sinigallia said.

The man said Austrian police had hit him and that some money that the family had stored up disappeared during their detention in Austria - a claim that could not be independently verified. Under EU rules, asylum-seekers have to remain in the first European country they enter while their application for asylum is being considered. ""Before they wanted a new life and they were upbeat.

""Even God has abandoned us,"" said Elvio, leaning on a bar in Tor Sapienza, a district on the eastern edge of Rome. With numerous abandoned properties, some of which have been squatted by illegal immigrants, the ""quartiere"" has certainly seen better days. The number of non-Italians living here is higher than in other parts of the capital. Yet it is worlds away from the bleak housing estates that dot the peripheries of cities like Paris or London and, to outsiders, last week's eruption of anger could easily appear rooted in ugly xenophobia. ""I'm not racist, but..."" has become a recurring refrain as people like Elvio vent widely-held beliefs that immigrants get special treatment from the state and are responsible for increasing crime. ""We are the poorest neighbourhood of Rome but we have so many of them,"" Elvio said. ""We are told they are Eritreans, but the war in Eritrea (a former Italian colony) has been finished for a long time. ""They hang around in groups in the park in the evenings. They make a noise, they make a mess and they leave beer bottles all over the place. And there have been robberies."" As Elvio tells it, the violence erupted after a local girl reported having been subjected to an attempted rape. ""They didn't speak Italian. We don't know who they were, who knows?"" he said. What is known is that a building housing around 50 migrants was pelted with stones, flares and other missiles for three consecutive nights. Windows were smashed, rubbish bins set ablaze and there were pitched battles with riot police that became sufficiently serious for the city authorities to order the removal of teenagers from the centre. There was also some evidence of the local protest being hijacked by far right groups with references to ""Il Duce"" - as Italy's former dictator Benito Mussolini styled himself - featuring alongside overtly racist and anti-Islamic chants. A prominent member of the fast-rising, anti-immigrant Northern League was one of the first politicians on the scene. The residents of the centre responded to the attacks on them in an open letter appealing to the generosity of spirit that has led to the Italian navy plucking some 150,000 migrants from the brink of death in the Mediterranean over the last year. ""We did not come to Italy to create problems, least of all to fight with Italians,"" the letter said. ""We are truly grateful to them -- we were saved in the middle of the sea by the Italian authorities. We are here to build new lives."" Tiziana Teti, a 40-year-old mother of a five-year-old girl, would rather the escapees from conflicts in Afghanistan/Pakistan and the Horn of Africa did that elsewhere. ""Yes I'm racist if saying Italians should come first makes me that. I know they are fleeing from war but is it up to us to look after them? There are too many of them. ""At school I pay for everything, even the toilet paper. They pay nothing."" Local pharmacist Salvatore says the migrants are easy scapegoats. ""They come and buy stuff from me and I have never had a problem,"" he said. Alessia Armini, who coordinates the municipal service that deals with the asylum-seekers, agrees. ""We have been made scapegoats for the problems of a neighbourhood in decline,"" she says, recalling how, at the height of last week's troubles, the terrified residents of the centre had to barricade themselves in for fear the building would be overrun by the mob. ""It was very scary for the younger ones in particular. Yes, there were moments of panic."""

The arrivals were mostly from sub-Saharan Africa and the vessels were on a cross-Mediterranean route taken by boats arriving from Libya, officials said. One dinghy was spotted some 70 nautical miles south of Lampedusa, Italy's southernmost point and a major gateway for economic migrants and refugees entering the European Union. The second dinghy was drifting and was rescued 35 nautical miles south of the first one. The asylum-seekers have been taken to a temporary shelter on Lampedusa, where there are also around 100 migrants from Eritrea who arrived on Sunday. Improved weather conditions and renewed upheaval in north Africa and the eastern Mediterranean have caused a surge in boat landings in Italy in recent weeks. Most of the arrivals are from sub-Saharan Africa but some arrive from Egypt and Syria or further afield from countries like Afghanistan and Bangladesh."

They were first spotted some 30 nautical miles southeast of Syracuse, a port which has seen a sharp increase in Syrian refugee arrivals in recent weeks. A coast guard helicopter initially lowered water canisters onto the vessel, where several of the people on board were suffering from dehydration. The asylum seekers were eventually transferred onto two coast guard vessels to be taken into port. Thousands of Syrian asylum-seekers have arrived in Italy this year, many of them taking long journeys across the Mediterranean from Egypt or Turkey."

					15:59 CET+01:00				",AFP,"Relief, but recognition of failings after Berlin attack suspect shot dead in Italy","A rookie Italian police officer on Friday shot dead the Tunisian suspect in the Berlin truck attack after four days on the run, ending a massive Europe-wide manhunt.
Anis Amri, 24, was accused of killing 12 people and wounding dozens more in Monday's assault on a Christmas market, which has been claimed by the Isis jihadist group.
Italy's interior minister Marco Minniti told a press conference in Rome that Amri had been fatally shot after pulling out a pistol and firing at police who had stopped him for a routine identity check around 3:00 am (0200 GMT) near Milan's Sesto San Giovanni train station.
Identity checks had established ""without a shadow of doubt"" that the dead man was Amri, the minister said.
He hailed the two policemen as heroes. Trainee officer Luca Scata, 29, fired the fatal shot. His partner Cristian Movio, 36, was hit in the shoulder and was in hospital awaiting surgery, but not in any danger.
""Italy can be really proud of these two officers,"" Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni said.
""We remain on maximum alert, we will not underestimate the threat but what happened overnight shows citizens that the state is there for them.""
Amri's death comes as German police arrested two brothers on suspicion of planning to attack a shopping mall, while authorities in both Australia and Indonesia reported that Christmas terror plots had been foiled.
Amri had been missing since escaping after Monday's attack in central Berlin.
He had links to Italy, having arrived on a migrant boat in 2011 during the Arab spring.
Relief in Germany
Shortly after his arrival he was sent to prison for starting a fire in a refugee centre. He was released in 2015 and made his way to Germany, taking advantage of Europe's open borders, as he did on his return to Italy.
Milan police chief Antonio De Iesu said Amri had arrived in Italy after travelling through France.
German police said the Tunisian had steered the 40-tonne truck in the attack after finding his fingerprints inside the cab, next to the body of its registered Polish driver, who was killed with a gunshot to the head.
A 100,000-euro ($104,000) reward had been offered for information leading to Amri's arrest.
In Tunisia, a brother of the fugitive had appealed to him to surrender and said: ""If my brother is behind the attack, I say to him 'You dishonour us'.""
German officials voiced relief that Amri had been found. Chancellor Angela Merkel has said she is ""proud of how calmly most people reacted"" to the country's deadliest attack in years.
But her assuring message failed to dampen furious criticism of security lapses and bungling in the investigation.
'A lot went wrong'
Amri was a rejected asylum seeker and had long been known to German counter-terrorism agencies.
He was also on the radar of Italy's anti-terrorism police unit, having been identified as having possibly being radicalized in prison, Corriere della Sera said.
German news weekly Der Spiegel reported that in wiretaps, Amri could be heard offering to carry out a suicide operation, but that his words were too vague for an arrest warrant.
Amri had been monitored since March, suspected of planning break-ins to raise cash for automatic weapons to carry out an attack - but the surveillance was stopped in September because Amri was seen primarily as a small-time drug dealer.
Conservative lawmaker Stephan Mayer, a critic of Merkel's liberal stance on refugees, said the case ""held up a magnifying glass"" to the failings of her migration policy that brought almost 900,000 asylum seekers to Europe's top economy last year.
""It's clear that a lot went wrong... it was a systemic failure,"" said Peter Neumann, professor of security studies at King's College London.
Neumann argued that German security services lacked the manpower to maintain around-the-clock surveillance of the 550 known radical Islamists in Germany.
""Once the dust settles, it will be important to have a fundamental rethink,"" he added.
As the security debate raged, Germans were trying to carry on as normal but Christmas lights and singing were kept low-key out of respect for the victims.
Berliners have flocked back to the Breitscheid square market, which reopened on Thursday, and the government has urged citizens not to give in to fear.
On Friday, a memorial concert was planned at the iconic Brandenburg gate under the theme of ""Together Berlin"".
Among the dead were six Germans, 60-year-old Israeli Dalia Elyakim, and a young Italian woman called Fabrizia Di Lorenzo. Forty-eight others were injured.
Germany had until now been spared the jihadist carnage that has struck neighbouring France and Belgium.
But it has suffered a spate of smaller attacks, including two in July that left 20 people injured, both committed by asylum seekers and claimed by Isis.
