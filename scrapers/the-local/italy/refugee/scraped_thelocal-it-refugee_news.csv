					08:34 CEST+02:00				",AFP,'We need to listen to Italy': UN refugee chief,"The UN refugee chief said on Wednesday Italy alone could not be blamed for a stand-off that has left hundreds of migrants stranded for days in the Mediterranean and Europe should do more to share the burden.
Italy's new populist government – which under the leadership of nationalist Interior Minister Matteo Salvini has taken a hardline stance on immigration – came under fire from its EU neighbours after refusing to let a foreign charity boat carrying 629 migrants dock in Italy.
The migrants aboard the Aquarius, run by French charity SOS Mediterranean, were stuck on the overloaded ship for over 30 hours as Italy and Malta bickered over who should take them. Spain then stepped in and offered the port of Valencia, where the Aquarius is heading.
""As a European I feel ashamed that there is a boat roaming around the sea,"" UN High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi told reporters in Geneva. ""I think that closing ports, whoever does it, threatens rescue at sea, as we have seen in the case of the Aquarius, and therefore is not the right solution,"" he said.
But he stressed that ""the reason why Italy said it had closed ports is something we need to listen to"".
Grandi, an Italian national himself, pointed out that Italy had taken the brunt of the massive numbers of migrants crossing the Mediterranean from Libya towards Europe in recent years.

Italy calls for tougher reforms of EU's asylum rules
Salvini has repeatedly vowed to stem the flow of migrants to Italy, which has seen more than 700,000 arrive on its shores since 2013. Under EU rules, migrants must apply for asylum in the European country where they first arrive. That has put pressure on Italy and Greece, the entry points for hundreds of thousands of people fleeing war and poverty.
""I think that Italy is right to say that they cannot all go to Italy,"" Grandi said.
EU states adopted a temporary quota system in 2015 as a form of solidarity with Greece and Italy during the height of Europe's migrant crisis. Under that plan, 160,000 refugees were supposed to be relocated to other members of the bloc, but so far only around 30,000 relocations have taken place.
""The relocation programme for Greece [and] Italy, sorry, was a failure,"" Grandi said. ""Unless Europe goes back to this notion of sharing the burden, we will not get out of this situation,"" he said.
The UN refugee chief said there was an urgent need to clarify states' responsibility when it comes to allowing disembarkation in the cases of large-scale rescues.
""We have to have predictable arrangements, so that rescue boats know where to go,"" Grandi said, warning that ""otherwise, this [could be] a disincentive to rescue, [and] people may lose their lives if this doesn't happen.""
Unless there is some clear division of responsibilities, ""you will have more Aquarius' happening in the next few weeks, and this is profoundly shameful,"" he said.

					12:24 CEST+02:00				",The Local,Refugees protest against 'monotonous' Italian food,"A protest held by refugees against “monotonous” Italian food was “excessive”, especially at a time when thousands of Italians go hungry, the president of a police organization told The Local.
For two days, a group of about 40 asylum-seekers staying at a refugee centre in the Veneto province of Belluno refused to eat the “pasta with tomato sauce, bread and eggs” meals they were given and called to be fed food from their own countries, Libero Quotidiano reported.
To reinforce their point, they blocked a street with a wooden bench, put their lunch on the ground along with bags of clothes and threatened to leave the centre in La Secca, a hamlet in Ponte nelle Alpi.
They reportedly said “we do not eat this stuff”.
The refugees, said to have been staying at the centre for the past four months, also reportedly slashed the tyres of cars belonging to staff working there in protest against living conditions.
The protest, which follows similar ones at centres in Pozzallo in Sicily and Rome, was also partly sparked by “boredom”, the newspaper said, as they “do not know what to do with themselves”.
Police soon broke up the protest and the refugees resumed eating, but Antonio De Lieto, the president of Libero Sindicato di Polizia, a non-profit organization that represents staff of the state police force, told The Local that the action was “excessive”.
“There are thousands of Italians living in poverty and who aren’t even eating one meal a day, let alone two or three,” he said.
“They’re not complaining that the food isn’t good, but that it is not the food of their countries. But when you’re hosted in someone’s home, for example, you eat their food, right? It’s like on the many occasions I’ve been hosted in England, I don’t expect to eat spaghetti.”
Sam, a migrant from Gambia who has been staying at a centre on the outskirts of Rome for almost a year, told The Local that the food, which mainly consists of pasta, “is not good” and that some have started making their own meals.
“We need the diet from our country,” he said.
Sam, who paid a people smuggler €4,000 to travel to Italy, said he passes the days by travelling on buses throughout the capital.
“I don’t want to hang around the centre all day. I can’t work and even if I could, too many Italians are also looking for jobs. Once I get my documents I want to go somewhere else, maybe Germany or The Netherlands.”"

					09:03 CEST+02:00				",AFP,Italy cannot be 'Europe's refugee camp': Matteo Salvini,"Italy's new hardline interior minister Matteo Salvini said on Sunday that ""common sense"" was needed to stop the country from being ""Europe's refugee camp"" as he visited a migrant centre in the south.
The newly minted deputy prime minister in Italy's populist coalition government travelled to Sicily, one of the country's main refugee landing points, to push the anti-immigration platform that propelled him to power.
""Italy and Sicily cannot be Europe's refugee camp,"" he told a crowd of supporters under the blazing sun in the southern Sicilian town of Pozzallo, a migration hotspot.
""Nobody will take away my certainty that illegal immigration is a business... and seeing people make money on children who go on to die makes me furious,"" he added.
His comments came as more than 50 migrants drowned in the Mediterranean on Sunday, with 48 bodies found off Tunisia's southern coast and nine Syrians – including seven children – killed when their vessel sank off the coast of Turkey.
The port town of Pozzallo is also on the migration front line as one of the main landing points for refugees fleeing war, persecution and famine across North Africa and the Middle East.
A crowd of enthusiastic supporters and a smaller group of protesters had earlier gathered in front of the gates of the town's migrant centre, where Salvini would give his speech, trading insults and nearly coming to blows.
One protester brandished a sign saying ""refugees welcome"", while a supporter said ""we don't want any more pests"" and others simply chanted: ""Matteo, Matteo"".

After delivering his speech, Salvini went inside the centre to meet some of the 158 people who had landed in Pozzallo when they were rescued by a humanitarian boat on Friday.
The rescue operation, which was coordinated by the Italian coast guard, happened just hours after Salvini took his oath of office, and said he would ask his ministry's experts ""how to reduce the number of arriving migrants and increase the number of expulsions"".
""The good times for illegals is over – get ready to pack your bags,"" he said on Saturday.
However, while he retained the fighting tone that helped spur his rise to power, he did temper his words when it came to NGOs organising rescues at sea, which he has previously called ""smugglers"" and accused of complicity with people traffickers.
""I think it's better to spend money in the countries of origin, and now if there are NGOs that want to work for free, that's fine,"" Salvini said. The leader of the far-right League party also said the new government would ""not take a hard line on immigration but one of common sense"".
His fellow deputy prime minister, head of the anti-establishment Five Star Movement Luigi Di Maio, has also called rescue NGOs ""taxis on the sea"", although his rhetoric on immigration is more measured than that of the League.
Salvini is on the road seeking to rally support for his party's candidates in municipal elections later this month, as part of a broader effort to boost the traditionally northern party's profile in the country's poorer south.

European Union interior ministers will meet on Tuesday to discuss possible reforms of the EU's controversial Dublin rule, whereby would-be refugees must file for asylum in the first bloc member-state they enter. However, Salvini said he would not be attending, as he will be in Italy's parliament for a confidence vote on the new coalition with Five Star.
Salvini has condemned the Dublin rule as unfairly burdening Mediterranean countries and leading to ""an obvious imbalance in management, numbers and costs"".
The accord does heavily penalize Italy, which has seen more than 700,000 migrants arrive since 2013. Previously, the vast majority would continue their journeys to northern Europe, but the introduction of EU-backed processing centres to ensure migrants are identified at their first European entry point and tighter border controls installed by France, Switzerland and Austria are now creating roadblocks along this well-worn route.
A controversial agreement between Italy's former centre-left government and authorities and militias in Libya has triggered a decline in overall arrivals of some 75 percent since the summer of 2017. But so far this year Italian authorities have still registered more than 13,500 arrivals.

					13:50 CEST+02:00				",The Local,Only a quarter of Italian towns host refugees: study ,"In spite of Italy's position on the front line of the Mediterranean refugee crisis, just one in four of the country's municipalities has housed refugees and asylum seekers, according to a report in Italian newspaper La Stampa.
According to the report, just 2,026 of the country's 8,000 municipalities currently host migrants on humanitarian grounds, meaning the refugee burden is being unfairly shared across the country.
Since the start of 2015, more than 220,000 refugees have landed in Italy, with more than 80,000 arriving since January 2016.
Huge arrival numbers and slow processing times mean there are currently 101,113 people being housed, fed and in many cases, educated, by a mere quarter of the country's local councils.
A map showing the distribution of asylum seekers as of June 20th this year can be seen below.
Source: La Stampa
As its base, the map used fresh guidelines set by Italy's Interior Ministry last week, which stated that areas involved in the ministry-funded Sprar project (Protection System for Refugees and Asylum Seekers) should limit numbers to two or three migrants for every 1,000 residents, following complaints from overwhelmed local councils.
The green areas of the map represent municipalities in which the number of refugees is less than 2.5 per 1,000 citizens, the yellow areas where refugee numbers average 2.5 per 1,000, and the areas that exceed the new threshold are shown in red.
For example, Sant'Arcangelo, a town of 6250 people in the southern region of Basilicata hosts no refugees whatsoever, but Salemi, a town of 11,000 in Western Sicily, hosts 232.
According to new guidelines, Salemi therefore hosts 760 percent more asylum seekers than it's capable of supporting.
An interactive version of the map can be found here. Clicking on each municipality will bring up the precise number of asylum seekers living there.
Although new guidelines have been established, the rules only affect council's enrolled in the Interior Ministry's Sprar project, of which there are just 800. Some 1226 others are hosting migrants on a voluntary basis, which has in part contributed to the large scale un-evenness of distribution.
Earlier this month, Luca Zaia, The regional governor of Italy's northeastern Veneto province, said he was working to stop councils hosting more migrants after it emerged there were some 10,576 asylum seekers across the region.
“We are no longer prepared to let our territories suffer for the foolish policies of the Italian government and the EU,” said Zaia, who is a member of the anti-immigration Northern League party.
At the same time, the independent mayor of the Calabrian town of Brognaturo, which is home to 712 residents and 146 asylum seekers has said he would like to host even more.
“It hasn't been a problem – in fact it's a pleasure,” the town's independent mayor Giuseppe Iennarella told La Stampa."

					12:50 CEST+02:00				",AFP,How Italy's Cara Mineo became a refugee ghetto,"Armed guards patrol the perimeter of Italy's biggest migrant centre, the focus of a fierce debate over whether the country should open large ""hotspot"" camps to process new arrivals and stem the flow of people across the continent.
The grisly murder of a local couple and subsequent arrest of an Ivory Coast man from the Sicilian centre sparked an outcry in a country tired of being on the frontline of Europe's largest refugee crisis since World War II.
The vast complex, a former US military base with streets evoking American suburbia, currently shelters just over 3,000 asylum seekers - down from nearly 4,000 in the past, but still too many, critics demanding its closure say.
""How do you control 4,000 migrants? The centre becomes a town in itself, which doesn't help integration,"" said Anna Aloisi, mayor of the nearby town of Mineo, perched high above the centre.
Beyond 10-foot razor wire fences, migrants divided by ethnicity and religion live in 403 yellow and pink houses, sleeping several to a room on foam mattress, eating in the canteen or cooking over small electric stoves in their back gardens.
The community is cut off from the rest of the world: for miles around, there is nothing but fields, orange groves, dust.
""There's talk of prostitution, of drug trafficking, there is certainly a lively black market,"" Angela Lupo, a legal adviser for the Italian Council for Refugees (CIR) told AFP.
""The residents sell clothes, food, cigarettes and phonecards at bazaars dotted around the centre, there's even an illicit restaurant and a migrant-run taxi service. The controls are few and far between,"" she said.
Adawiah, a 23-year-old from Ghana who filed his request for asylum nearly 12 months ago, pleaded to be released from the limbo he lives in: ""We make the life we can, we have a message for Italy, 'You must do more, quickly, please.'""
Fear, jealousy, anger
Revelations that organised crime groups had infiltrated the centre's management left the government red-faced and minister Maria Elena Boschi promised parliament this week the camp was under review and closure was an option.
Countries such as Britain, France and Germany have urged the EU to set up further centres in Italy and Greece to fingerprint migrants and help separate asylum-seekers fleeing war from those motivated by economic reasons.
European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker this week detailed a plan under which Italy would open five so-called hotspots in its southern regions. But critics say human rights are at risk and the big camp model is not the answer.
""Mineo is a town of 5,000 people, but many of them are elderly and there are few youngsters. So the arrival of coloured migrants, all of them young, who hang around doing nothing, often make the townsfolk afraid,"" said mayor Aloisi, a member of Italy's New Centre Right party.
Elderly men sitting on benches in the town's cobbled square watch silently as Nigerians and Gambians barely out of their teens stroll past to a betting shop. Residents of the centre get 2.50 euro ($2.80) a day pocket money.
Maurizio Nalfo, a local who works for the forestry service but has not been paid in months, said the asylum seekers weren't seen as the problem by residents, ""It's politics which creates the disparity between Italians and migrants.""
It's a familiar tale, echoed across recession-hit Italy. ""The citizens see the migrants are taken care of, have a hot meal, a roof over their heads, when they struggle to have a hot meal themselves, it sparks jealousies, anger,"" Aloisi said.
The centre's director Sebastiano Maccarrone, 51, who previously worked at the infamous reception centre on the island of Lampedusa - closed in 2013 due to the dire conditions inside - insisted he has everything under control.
But CIR says many residents see little of the services which state funding should ensure - Italian lessons, legal help, medical care - and can only play football while waiting for their paperwork to be handled, which can take two years.
As the crisis intensified across Europe, Pope Francis called last week for Christian parishes to take in refugees -- a sentiment applauded by those in favour of doing away with unwieldy centres, as well as the migrants themselves.
""We don't have job, we don't do anything, we stay all day in the camp,"" said Nigerian Bright Aghama, 31, a regular at the centre's church, which has been situated some distance from the site's makeshift mosque.
Bright, who has been in the centre for over a year, said despite the daily struggle with boredom and uncertainty over the future, he was grateful for ""a place where I can lay my head, where I can have peace of mind."""

					09:20 CET+01:00				",The Local,Italy's refugee rugby team tries for success,"The first Italian rugby team made almost exclusively of refugees has belatedly begun life at in Italy's lowest league, after receiving special permission from the Italian Rugby Federation to allow it to compete.
The new outfit, Le Tre Rose from Casale Monferrato in Piedmont, was initially forbidden from playing in the Serie C league because federation laws state that each squad can only have one foreign player, Il Fatto Quotidiano reported.
The rules were designed to support the development Italian rugby talent at grassroots level, but they had blocked the team from starting the season as 80 percent of the squad is made of African refugees who have fled wars and persecution to find a better life in Italy.
The squad was therefore forced to spend two months petitioning the Italian Rugby Federation and the Italian Olympic Committee (Coni) in order to get the go-ahead to compete.
The rules were finally waived in December.
The rugby federation said that special dispensation had been granted for Le Tre Rose as the squad represented an important opportunity for social integration.
“Support and solidarity for friends are without doubt characteristics of the sport and so we accepted their request,” the federation's president, Alfredo Gavazzi, said.
“Our primary aim is to promote the game of rugby and through the game teach values typical of the sport.”
Although the team has permission to compete, it will be prevented from advancing to Serie B should it finish in the playoff positions at the end of the season - due to its extreme majority of foreign players.
However, here is little risk of the team finishing anywhere near the top of Serie C.
Most of the refugees playing for Le Tre Rose hadn't seen a rugby ball before setting foot in Italy and had to learn the game from scratch with the help of enthusiastic local players.
In their first game, played at the end of December, the team lost 85-7 to Acqui Terme – one of the league's high flyers. They fared slightly better in their second outing against Novi Ligure going down just 37-0.
But clearly, at this stage at least, results don't matter.
“Above all else it's about playing,” club manager Luca Patrucco said. “Being here is already a miracle.”"

					13:01 CEST+02:00				",The Local,How to help refugees if you live in Italy,"Thousands of people from Syria, Eritrea and elsewhere are still arriving every month on the country's shores. There are lots of ways you can help these refugees in their hour of need - here are some ideas from The Local.
Over 50,000 people arrived in Italy in the first half of the year - and while much of the world's focus has shifted to Greece, they keep coming. Many who arrive are traumatized - they may have lost loved ones and risked their own lives while crossing the Mediterranean. Many ordinary Italians have been quick to help - and you can contribute too. Here's how.
1. Donate money
One of the quickest ways to help is to get online and donate money. There are a host of organizations operating in Italy, so we’ve picked out just a few.
The UN’s refugee agency, UNHCR, has an Italy-specific page or a general English-language donation website.
There’s also Save the Children, which works with children as soon as they step on shore and in centres across Italy. They also have both a global and national donation page. Don’t miss Italy’s version of the Red Cross, the Croce Rossa.
The International Organization for Migration also has staff helping refugees in Italy.
Doctors Without Borders (MSF, Medici Senza Frontiere in Italian) has medical teams in Italy. They are also operating their own rescue ships and working alongside another organization, the Migrant Offshore Aid Station (MOAS), to help rescue people at sea.
2. Give gifts
Clothes, shoes, shampoo, tents and books are just some of the items people have donated to refugees. To find out where to donate take a look at your local church group, as religious organizations often run centres for refugees.
In Rome there’s the Joel Nafuma Refugee Center (JNRC) and the Centro Astalli, part of the Jesuit Refugee Service, amongst others. Outside of the Italian capital, Caritas is another Catholic charity with centres across the country. Or just contact your local religious leader to find out if there are any schemes in your area.
3. Give your time
A number of the organizations listed above accept volunteers. While some tasks can be done by just about anyone, such as handing out breakfast at a refugee centre, think hard about whether you have any particular skills which could be valuable.
Refugees not only need sustenance, but are also often in need of translators to help them communicate and councillors to help them overcome trauma.
Think long-term and consider whether you have experience in an area which could help refugees set up life in Italy, such as teaching a trade which could help someone get a job.
4. Take care of a child
By 20th July this year, 7,439 unaccompanied minors had arrived in Italy by sea during 2015. Their young age makes children even more vulnerable than adults who have made the journey.
While Save the Children is the most well-known organization focussed on helping underage arrivals, Sicilian group AccoglieRete can help arrange for you to become a legal guardian to a child in need. You could also consider becoming a foster parent.
5. Talk to people in power
If you want Italy to continue to save lives at sea and support refugees arriving in the country, tell the government. You can contact your local MP through the government’s own website, or get in touch with Italy’s political representatives at the EU.
If you’re a citizen of another EU country which you believe should be supporting Italy, you can also contact your own government directly."

					16:48 CET+01:00				",Angela Giuffrida,Puglia fears potential refugee influx will deter tourists ,"Hoteliers in Puglia, the sun-kissed region in the heel of Italy's boot, fear the potential surge in refugees after the closure of the so-called ‘Balkans route' will damage the area's vital tourism sector.
Fears were stoked after Puglia's regional president, Michele Emiliano, said last week that as many as 150,000 refugees could arrive this year now that the route between Greece and northern Europe has been blocked.
The route closure could see refugees instead crossing to Puglia over the Strait of Otranto from Albania, which borders Greece.
The region's coastguard has been on high alert since Serbia and Macedonia shut off their borders last week.
Meanwhile, Italian authorities, worried about a repeat of 1991, when thousands of Albanian refugees made the same journey following the collapse of communism, have also despatched police officers to Albania to strengthen border controls.
“The situation is calm right now, but if it does reach significant proportions it will severely hurt tourism,” Francesco Caizzi, the president of Federalberghi, the Italian hotel association, for Bari province, told The Local, adding that hotel owners had voiced their concerns during a recent meeting.
Although hoteliers have not reported an impact on bookings so far, he warned that the region “needs to be prepared”.
“The tourism sector is strongly affected by certain influences – just look at what happened in Lampedusa, where tourism has been hurt since the island became a place for thousands of migrants.”
Interior Minister Angelino Alfano has moved to calm the fears, saying last week that there was no evidence, at least not as yet, of the number of refugee arrivals in Puglia intensifying.
Others in the region have also played down concerns, saying that Puglia, with its coastline stretching over more than 800km, is more than equipped to deal with large numbers of refugees.
“I've said this several times before – this refugee 'upheaval' is not happening,” Mauro Della Valle, the Salento president for Federbalneari, an association for beach-side resorts, told The Local.
“Also, the refugee phenomenon in Puglia is not new – it's been happening for years. We can't compare it to Lampedusa, which is small. Puglia has a long stretch of coastline.”
Della Valle added that town and city mayors are preparing for any increase in arrivals, with shelters being set up across the region.
A so-called 'hotspot' has also been established in the port of Taranto to help facilitate the speedy processing of refugee arrivals.
“This is a humanitarian emergency, and we will react how we've always done – by being welcoming. Besides, refugees don't want to stay here, they want to move on to northern Europe.""
But the route towards the likes of Germany from Italy is also looking increasingly precarious after Austria's Foreign Minister Sebastian Kurz called for further border controls on Sunday, saying that he wants to shut off the Italian Mediterranean route into Austria.
To date, the main route into Italy for refugees has been through Sicily. Eighty percent of the 153,000 who arrived in Italy in 2015 landed in Sicily from Libya and Egypt, according to figures from the International Organization for Migration (IOM)."

					14:59 CEST+02:00				",Catherine Edwards,"'In a refugee home, right and wrong don't always go hand in hand with the law'","“There's a huge contrast between the love tourists and so-called ‘expats' like me have for Tuscany, and the shock that asylum seekers have to absorb when they are told that they might have to spend several years in the Tuscan outback,” explains Katja Meier, who spent several years running a refugee centre in the Tuscan hills.
""Where I saw beauty they saw bush; where I saw peace and calm they saw boredom and lack of opportunities.""
The same may apply to young Italians who grow up in rural areas, but Meier says refugees facing additional culture and language barriers were acutely aware that opportunities for work and integration would be easier in northern Europe.
Meier, a trained actress from Switzerland who had moved to Italy to work as an olive picker, found herself running a Tuscan refugee centre in the midst of the migration crisis, and has now written a book about her experiences there.
As growing numbers of people who had risked the oversea journey arrived at Italy's shores, the women's shelter she had been volunteering at began to accommodate refugees. Since her English skills were a rare and valuable commodity in the Tuscan countryside, she was asked to oversee the running of the centre.
But despite being able to communicate with the refugees, Meier says that at the start, ""they were skeptical of anything I said or did"".
""They had learnt the hard way during their trip to Europe that it was best not to trust anybody,"" she explains.
Some of the women had been locked up and abused in Libya before managing to escape on a boat to make the dangerous oversea journey, while one of them, Hope, had been sold by her own aunt to a human trafficking ring.
Meier doesn't know what happened to Hope, whose phone number and Facebook account were deactivated after she had to leave the home.
""The best moments are when you feel you're able to make a difference, and it's hard when you realize that no matter how hard you might have been trying, it didn't change anything,"" she tells The Local.
Some of the time, making a difference could be something as simple as offering a listening ear, or helping arrange translators or doctors' appointments for the refugees - but other times, tasks were more difficult.
One young Gambian women asked for help travelling to join her cousin in Germany.
""This was usually a no go,"" says Meier, but the woman had survived a major shipwreck. More than four hundred people died when the boat she was on capsized, and all four of the family members she had travelled with were among them.
""In a situation like that, right and wrong didn't necessarily go hand in hand with house rules and European law,"" says Meier.

The home she worked in was one of many opened up in Tuscany's countryside since the Arab Spring, as Italy found itself on the frontline of the migrant crisis.
""Italy really rose to the challenge, especially considering that for many years the EU just chose to look the other way,"" the author says.
But the subtitle of her book, 'Good intentions and hard lessons from an Italian refugee home', sums up her view of the Italian response to the crisis.
She explains: ""While there were good emergency solutions - both the homes on land and the response at sea - have their limitations and shouldn't have to become permanent ones. Now it's time for Italy and Europe to reflect and analyse the response.""
The end result of her own reflection is a book, rather than an article or blog, because she wanted to be able to ""tell the whole story"" and have space to explore intricacies without having them misinterpreted.
""If I say ‘working with refugees can be very challenging' my statement can be instrumentalized very easily in the current political climate - for this reason, the problems aren't always discussed very openly. But life is complex and most things worthwhile will also be challenging and difficult, this doesn't mean we should try to avoid them,"" explains Meier.
Meier doesn't shy away from talking about mismanagement, day-to-day bureaucracy, or the disagreements in the centre, though she notes that many of these were inevitable in a shared living space, with groups of people from vastly different backgrounds thrown together.
""I was relieved to be able to help - but helping always comes with expectations. You may start off as the Good Samaritan, but unless you're a saint, sooner or later some expectations will be kicking in and there will be endless material for disappointments and misunderstandings (on both sides!)"" she says.
""The fact people are at home most of the day with nothing much to do doesn't help. There's endless potential for arguments about cleaning, sharing, and discussions about different moral codes and acceptable behaviour, though interestingly, religion never created any problems at our refuge the few times Christians and Muslims shared the home,"" Meier remembers.
""If anything, discussion about religion would be with me – I'm an atheist – and several refugees insisted I should believe in God or Allah, but didn't really care which one of the ‘two' I'd choose.”
Despite some challenges, she also has very fond memories of her time spent running the centre and made close friends with many of the residents. Limited public transport links in the Tuscan outback meant that every appointment at the nearest immigration or hospital resulted in a few hours in the car with the refugees, and Meier says that driving through Tuscany's famous hills often got people to open up.
""Several important scenes in the book - and some of my own fondest memories - are of our long drives cruising through the hills,"" she says.
Having recently published the book, Meier continues to offer help to many of the refugees she worked with at the home. She is hoping to launch educational courses for newcomers in a Tuscan farm, as well as building links with political organizations working with migrants and sex workers.
Katja Meier was born in Switzerland and has lived in Italy for nearly two decades. Trained as an actress, she worked as an olive picker, wedding planner and life coach before taking on an Italian refugee home. Katja writes for travel publications and lives with her Italian partner and their two children next to an olive grove in the Tuscan countryside. Her book, Across the Big Blue Sea, is out now."

Faced with rising numbers of migrants risking the perilous sea crossing to reach Europe, Italy last week threatened to close its doors to people arriving on boats with foreign flags.
Europe had to get fully involved through an ""urgent distribution system"" of migrants and should widen legal channels so that migrants can be admitted, Grandi added.
He also called for greater international efforts to tackle the causes of the migration, protect people and fight trafficking.

Interior Minister Marco Minniti said the ministry's goal was ""to erase the word 'emergency' which is so often put together with the word 'immigration"".
Speaking in Rome, he outlined three ways the government hopes to do this: through deals with Libya and other African countries aimed at managing migration, through a 'welcoming policy' in Italy, and through encouraging and facilitation integration with the newly announced National Integration Plan.
Rather than targeting all migrants, the plan is aimed specifically at people holding refugee or subsidiary protection status, of which there are almost 75,000 in Italy.
In return for agreeing to respect Italian values and play an active part in their new communities by working, volunteering, and socializing, migrants in this group will be put on waiting lists for homes and jobs. The plan has been financed with EU funds and put together with collaboration from various government ministries, local authorities, and non-governmental organizations.
How Italy is getting asylum seekers to help out in their new communities
Italy's imams to get training on the Italian Constitution
How a tiny Italian town opened its homes to refugees
Here are five of the key elements of the plan, which can be read in full (in Italian) at the ministry's website.
Italian values
Migrants signing up to the project agree to adhere to Italian values as set out in the Constitution, including the separation of state and religion, and gender equality.
Minitti defined integration as ""a point of mutual renegotiation"" and said that ""an integrated country is a safer country"". The Italian government also pledged to ensure freedom of religion and access to initiatives facilitating the migrants' inclusion in society.
It will also encourage ""active citizenship"", for example local volunteering or signing up to the national civil service, and provide facilities to encourage socialization among minors, in order to stop them slipping through the net and also to help tackle Islamophobia within Italian communities.

Language
""Learning the Italian language is a right but also a duty"" for new arrivals in the country, the plan states. Migrants will be required to sign up to language classes held in reception centres while under-18-year-olds must be enrolled in the Italian school system.
In return, the state will recognize qualifications obtained in migrants' home countries, offer testing to ensure they are enrolled in the correct level of language course, and give special support to those who are illiterate when they arrive in Italy.

Housing
The government has committed to extending the housing options available to migrants when they leave reception centres, by including holders of international protection status (this includes refugees) in regional authorities' emergency housing plans.
The plan also calls for migrants to be ""distributed equally across the territory"" in order to make the initiatives sustainable and avoid overcrowding in particular regions or towns.

Jobs
Unemployment remains high in Italy following the financial crisis, and is disproportionately elevated among foreigners. In the new plan, the government commits to promoting careers guidance, training and apprenticeship schemes for migrants, and offering specialized support to vulnerable categories including women.

Under the hot Roman sun, AS Roma legend Damiano Tommasi led his team including '98 World Cup winner, French national Vincent Candela and AS Roma star Simone Perotta onto the pitch.
Sporting sky-blue kits, their visibly awe-struck opponents, a team of refugees and asylum seekers all under the age of 18, were eager to show off their skills on the pitch.
""I'm convinced that initiatives like these are very useful,"" said Marcello Mancini of the Italian Football Coach Association (AIAC Onlus) which helped organise the event along with the UNHCR and the Italian Football ssociation
(AIC).
""The world of football can be a megaphone able to promote, especially among young people, values such as solidarity and openness to those who, through no fault of their own, find themselves from one day to the next living in fear and without any stability.""
Beaming, taking selfies in the changing room and triumphantly celebrating their goal as the crowd danced and applauded, the event represents a moment of fun for the young team as tensions over immigration reach the boiling point in Italy.
Italy's new far-right interior minister has cracked down on immigration, promising to stop migrant arrivals and speed up deportations.
""Sentiment (towards refugees) has been a bit particular, not only in Italy but in Europe in general,"" said former AS Roma star Damiano Tommasi. ""The 'other' scares us. And it is right to support these events that can help the inclusion because that is the future.""
It is the second year that the Champions #WithRefugees match has been held between footballing stars and those integrating into Italian society. The event marks World Refugee Day which took place on June 20th.
""It's always important, it's a good cause. There is always a pleasure and a happiness to meet again and especially for the charity, for the refugees,"" said former AS Roma player Vincent Candela.
""We know football has no colour, no borders. That's the good thing about being on the field: we're all together.""

					11:22 CEST+02:00				",The Local,'Italy must stop refugee flow or we’ll shut Brenner pass',"Austria has threatened to completely close the Brenner pass, one of the main links across the Alps, unless Italy stops the flow of refugees to its northern neighbour.
The country’s Defense Minister Hans Peter Doskozil said the “extreme” measure would be implemented if Italy fails to stop refugees crossing the border or doesn’t accept those who are sent back.
Speaking at a meeting of his SPÖ party in Innsbruck on Wednesday night, Doskozil said the Tyrol area of Austria has become a “refugee waiting room”.
Austria is adopting an increasingly hardline approach to the refugee crisis, deporting 2,800 failed asylum seekers since the start of the year.
Austrian police said construction work began on Tuesday on concrete foundations for a planned control area off the northbound motorway at the Brenner pass, which was an active transit point last summer for migrants making their way up from southern Italy.
Meanwhile, Austrian Interior Minister Johanna Mikl-Leitner said that while her government will do everything possible to avoid drastic solutions, “Italy must do more to process migrants”.
Austria, which received 90,000 asylum claims last year, has already stepped up controls along its borders with Slovenia and Hungary.
The planned fence at the Italian border came under attack by the EU after Italy's Foreign Minister Paolo Gentiloni and Interior Minister Angelino Alfano wrote a joint letter to EU Migration Commissioner Dimitris Avramopoulos demanding that he urgently raise the issue with Vienna.
European Commission spokeswoman Natasha Bertaud said on Tuesday that Avramopoulos would discuss the construction work with Austrian Interior Minister Johanna Mikl-Leitner.
""If these plans should materialize then we will have to look at them very seriously. The Brenner pass is essential for freedom of movement within the European Union,"" she told a press conference. ""The Commission is very concerned.""
The Italian ministers said the Austrian actions ""did not appear to be based on the facts"", adding that Mikl-Leitner had ""presented no data showing an alleged increase in the migrant flow from Italy"".
Austria, which has said it will implement additional control measures at its borders from June 1st, is also concerned that following the closure earlier this year of the Balkan trail from Greece towards Austria, a new route across the sea from Libya to Italy and then northwards will open up."

Some 30 migrants and 20 Italian activists, who had been warned ahead of the evacuation, moved to the coastal rocks before dawn to be well clear once police arrived at nearly 6:30am, deputy police chief Giuseppe Maggese said.
The camp was cleared because its occupants were using electricity and water without paying for it, a police spokesman told AFP.
A cordon of about thirty policemen stood along the shoreline in front of the migrants, some of whom were threatening to jump into the sea, while others held up a banner in English reading: ""we want freedom to cross the border.""

Ventimiglia, which became a flashpoint at the start of Europe's migrant crisis earlier this year, has acted as a bottleneck for the France-bound refugees who arrived in Italy.
While officially France has called for the Schengen agreements to be “scrupulously” respected by all EU countries, the reality is that Paris has done anything but, at least when it comes to this border.
French authorities have long been implementing controls to try to stem the tide of refugees crossing the border, with the result being that hundreds have been taken back to Italy."

The centre has been under investigation since June for a number of irregularities, but prosecutors have found evidence of an allegedly fraudulent magnetic card system.
Through the system, the centre was able to to claim €35 a day for refugees who had left, Giornaletissimo reported.
The centre, located near Catania in Sicily, holds around 4,000 refugees. On arrival, each refugee is issued with a magnetic card that allows them access to on-site services such as the medical clinic, the market and the canteen while they wait for their asylum claims to be processed.
When a refugee does not use their card for three consecutive days, the card automatically sends an alert to a computer system which records that they are no longer at the centre. After five days, the card is automatically disabled.
However, after three days of absence the day rate of €35 should no longer be paid to the centre.
While this information was automatically recorded into the system at Mineo – it was allegedly never passed on to the regional authorities.
The result is that over the last four years, hundreds of thousands of euros could have been paid to the centre for refugees who had left the vast holding complex long before.
The investigation, led by prosecutor Giuseppe Verzera, is also investigating irregularities with a €100 million contract tender put out for the management of the centre as well as claims of nepotism in its hiring practices."

					09:43 CET+01:00				",Catherine Edwards,This app is helping refugee children speak Italian,"Thousands of child migrants arrive in Italy every year, often unaccompanied and rarely with any knowledge of Italian - which can present problems for those trying to help and work with them.
A newly-released app, Benvenuti ABC, aims to teach migrant and refugee children some basic Italian and English, allowing for better communication between new arrivals and volunteers.
""Italy is at the frontier of the migration crisis, and in Italy you really need to speak Italian,"" explained Paolo Giovine, CEO of digital publishing company PubCoder, which created Benvenuti ABC.
""The questions that refugees have are urgent - they might need to ask for food, blankets or medicine.""
The app teaches children words by showing animated drawings - 'a' is for 'acqua' (water), 'aeroplano' (aeroplane) and 'amico' (friend) - and written translations of the word in Italian, English and Arabic. Audio is provided for the first two languages, but not for Arabic due to the varied pronunciation in different dialects.
The idea for Benvenuti ABC came from one of Giovine's friends, who had created a German app (Das WillkommensABC) which helped refugees to learn German, and was used in Cologne's refugee camps. It was clear that there was a need for something similar in Italy.
""When I started out, I didn't know that one in three migrant arrivals is a child,"" Giovine told The Local. ""When children don't speak the local language, it can be tough for volunteers to welcome them and make them feel safe.""
Having decided to provide the technology for the product for free, the team launched a call to illustrators to contribute an image to the book.
In the end, over 120 artists submitted pictures, but Giovine says he wasn't surprised to see such strong support for the project. He believes that ""Italy has always been a country of immigration, a melting pot of cultures with a deep history of welcoming"".
Benvenuti ABC can be downloaded as an app for IOS or Android devices, or browsed online. Initially, it was made available only to volunteers with Migrantes Foundation - Italy's biggest charity organization working with migrants - to assess how well it worked, but now it is freely available and has been downloaded hundreds of times.
Giovine says he has been contacted by several schools where the app has proved useful for welcoming migrant students, and has already received suggestions for how they can expand the app.
""We're now collaborating with a school to create a Chinese version, so that we can also help the huge and growing Chinese community in Italy. And if we have requests for another language, or requests to add more Arabic words, we can do that.""
As well as serving the immediate purpose of facilitating communication between new arrivals and native Italians, Giovine hopes that the app will encourage further initiatives by demonstrating how easy it is to create technological solutions to problems.
He also hopes to draw attention to the problems faced by migrants in integrating and communicating in Italy.
""Some people simply don't pay attention [to the migrant crisis]; others seem to live in fear of an unspecified invasion,"" he said. ""In fact, migration isn't a risk, but an opportunity. Migrant children of today could be our best scientists; their insights will save even those who try to keep them out."""

""We'd be at home doing nothing, we have no work, we'd simply eat, sleep,"" said Paul Adjei from the Ivory Coast. ""So we decided together to help the town, so it can move forwards.""
The question of what to do with the thousands of people arriving in Italy each year has proved divisive.
There are over 175,000 asylum seekers languishing in reception centres as they wait for their applications to be processed, which can take up to two years.
""Many cannot bear not doing anything,"" Carlotta Sami, a spokeswoman for the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), told AFP.

""So making themselves useful for a few hours a day for the community that is welcoming them can be a good thing for them psychologically,"" she said.
Migrants in Italy are allowed to start working two months after they lodge their application for asylum, but jobs are thin on the ground.
'Need to invest'
The government is expected to pledge next week to speed up the repatriation of those refused permission to stay, but has had difficulties sealing deals with many countries.
It will also warn regional councils across Italy that asylum seekers will be spread more evenly, with 2.5 migrants to every 1,000 residents - a plan that has been denounced by some mayors who say they have neither the resources nor the will to host outsiders.

Belluno, which has a left-wing mayor but sits in the middle of anti-immigrant Northern League territory, is not complaining. The 100 or so migrants here have painted the town's railings and school gates and mowed lawns in parks under the supervision of local associations.
The project, launched in 2014, is based on the idea that autonomy can facilitate lasting integration. Instead of forcing asylum seekers to live in tent camps or large centres, they are given small apartments to share, and do their own shopping and cooking.
Mayor Jacopo Massaro laughs off the suggestion that he is the antithesis of Trump and other advocates of walls to keep migrants out.
""I don't feel like an anti-Trump, no! To put it simply, we thought that what with the difficulties Italy and Europe are experiencing, we all need to invest a little to resolve a problem that is bigger than us"", he said.

A helping hand
The flow of people from the coasts of northern Africa to Italy - 170,000 in 2014, 150,000 in 2015 and 181,000 last year - has resulted in the biggest migrant crisis since World War Two.
But as Italy groans under the pressure, the idea of making asylum seekers work for free has angered those who say the country should be tackling its unemployment problem.

Youth unemployment in the country stood at 40 percent in December. Massaro says that the migrants are doing jobs the town cannot afford, and that ""we have not taken away work from anyone"".
Not everyone, however, is keen to work without pay.
""We cannot be left with nothing in our pockets, we need more. We need a job,"" Adjei said.

One organiser - under the name Massimo - spoke about the planned action on an internet radio site.
He said: “We will hold the event on the Italian and Austrian side at the time same. If the democratic totalitarians want to erect fences, we will as enemies not accept the borders and make it impossible.”
Four hundred participants are expected to take part at the upcoming weekend demonstration. It will be the third such demonstration to take place at the Brenner border.
At previous protests, which had been registered with authorities prior to the event, several hundred demonstrators turned up and around the same number of police.
At the first protest estimates of between 500 and 800 people from Italy, Austria and Germany marched to the border in what began as a peaceful event but descended into violence between 50 participants and police. Five officers were injured in the clashes.
The second protest, which took place two weeks ago, saw hundreds of mostly Italian protesters push up against a line of Austrian riot police.
The demonstrators are angry about the measures being taken at the border checkpoint, including preparations for a 400-metre-long fence that Austria says it will erect if Italy does not cooperate with controlling the number of migrants and refugees crossing the border.
From the end of May, Austria will also introduce border checks in the area, similar to those already in place along the country's southern and eastern borders.
South Tyrol police say they are taking the latest activity from the protesters seriously and authorities on both the Austrian and Italian side of the border are in contact with each other in relation to the event.
“This group are being observed and, following the announcement that reached us, there will be an appropriate police presence,” said South Tyrol's provincial head Arno Kompatscher.
Police - who at the last protest deployed 300 officers - say they are preparing for a possible large operation on Saturday."

That would certainly be in keeping with what news organisations, politicians and research bodies have asserted in the past several years.
In fact, Europe has coped with comparable situations – not least the Balkan crisis of the early 1990s. It tends to be overlooked that the Yugoslav experience has informed EU refugee policy this time around. Arguably this has made the situation better than it might otherwise have been.
Contrary to popular belief, similar numbers of people from the former Yugoslavia sought asylum in northern Europe as Syrians have more recently – as demonstrated below. Indeed, more sought asylum from the former Yugoslavia in Sweden, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Denmark, Norway and the UK than from Syria so far.

Looking at asylum seekers in general, more did come to most northern European countries during the 2010s than the early 1990s. Yet the difference is not enormous: approximately 2.5m in 1991-96 versus 3.2m in 2011-16.
While Germany, Sweden, France and Austria have recorded more applications in the more recent period, the opposite is true for the Netherlands and the UK. And since most northern European countries’ populations rose between the early 1990s and the early 2010s, the overall difference will also be less as a proportion of populations as a whole.

The northern European media have nevertheless given much more prominence to the latest crisis. Partly this is because those seeking protection in the early 1990s mainly came by car, bus or train. In more recent years, many asylum seekers have taken to the seas to get around Europe’s strict visa laws. Images of distressed boat migrants played out in the media before millions of viewers. It became a border spectacle, which encouraged perceptions of migrants’ illegality in the process.
The fear of Islamic terrorists posing as refugees also differs substantially nowadays. Although many Muslims from Bosnia and outside Europe applied for asylum in the early 1990s, their religious background was not such an issue.
Following 9/11 – and numerous other Islamic terrorist attacks in the West – debates about immigration and asylum have become far more security and culturally oriented. This has frequently been driven by anti-immigration parties such as UKIP in the UK, France’s Front National and the Partij voor de Vrijheid in the Netherlands.
These parties did sometimes break through in northern Europe in the early 1990s. The Freiheitliche Partei Österreichs in Austria attained 22% of the national vote in 1994, for example. Nevertheless these parties have become much more media savvy and presentable, as demonstrated by Marine le Pen in France and the Brexit success in the UK. This has been heavily assisted by the economic crisis and a sense of disillusion with mainstream politics.
EU in the dock
The anti-immigration parties attach much blame to the EU for allowing too many people to come in and failing to control what happens at borders. The truth is rather more complicated.
During both crises, many European states have adopted a beggar-thy-neighbour attitude to asylum. States, including Germany, that encouraged joint European responses have borne most of the burden. In 1994 Germany proposed a pan-EU distribution system for asylum seekers. Other EU members, especially the UK and France, opposed this – despite receiving relatively few applicants. In the end, the EU shelved the idea.
The likes of the Germans and Swedes perceived that the EU’s lack of power over immigration asylum policy was part of the problem, so they sought reform. As a result, the EU’s influence on the immigration and asylum affairs of member states has since developed significantly. The 1997 Dublin Convention requires asylum seekers to apply for protection in the first EU country they enter, while the 1999 Common European Asylum System attempted to harmonise the whole asylum process.
Another lesson post-Yugoslavia was that instead of relying on the likes of the British, you seek alternatives. So instead of any move towards proper collective responsibility for EU asylum seekers, the southern and central European states have taken more responsibility while the north’s commitment has stayed the same.
Southern EU countries, notably Greece and Italy, agreed to this in the 2000s because they had few refugees and wanted to implement a comparable system to the northern states over time. Newer EU states joined too late to influence negotiations. You can see the consequences in this graph:

Not only has the EU therefore reduced northern member states’ asylum burden, with Angela Merkel to the fore it successfully negotiated an agreement with Turkey last March. This helped greatly reduce the numbers making the sea voyage to Greece, cutting all boat voyages to Europe by roughly two-thirds in 2016.
This has not solved the problem. The numbers dying at sea actually increased in the same period despite this agreement because the journey from Libya to Italy is much more dangerous. It remains difficult for the EU to strike a deal with Libya – the country’s civil war is ongoing and it has never signed the UN Refugee Convention. Migrants also tend to be treated appallingly in Libyan detention centres.
Many EU states are nevertheless seeking a way around this problem –a plan was agreed earlier this year to curb refugee numbers from Libya. Expect further debate about such initiatives once peak season begins.
In short, what separates the current refugee crisis is not its scale. It is that it has occurred during a perfect storm of other factors: the economic crisis, the rise of anti-immigration parties, and a media increasingly desperate for readers and arguably resorting to ever uglier coverage to keep them.
Look beyond this and the northern European countries have clearly tried to learn from the past. The real question is whether the fix is workable – in particular, the shifting of some of the burden to southern and central European states. It is not at all clear whether they have the capacity to cope with it.

					16:54 CEST+02:00				",The Local,This Caravaggio was chosen to honour Italy's refugees,"A masterpiece by the Italian master Caravaggio was unveiled on the Italian island of Lampedusa on Friday as part of a special refugee-themed art exhibition.
The iconic 1608 painting 'Sleeping Cupid' has been loaned to the island's newly established 'Museum of Faith and Dialogue for the Mediterranean' by Florence's Uffizi art gallery.
It is the first time the picture, which shows a baby boy sprawled out next to a broken bow and arrow, has been exhibited outside Florence since it was acquired by Cardinal Leopoldo de' Medici in 1610.
Authorities say the painting was especially chosen refugee exhibition because it draws parallels with a photo of a drowned refugee child which scandalized Europe in summer 2015.
“Aylan, the boy who was found dead on a Turkish beach last year, was reminiscent of the sleeping cupid,” Eike Schmidt, curator of the Uffizi gallery told Italian arts magazine Vita.
But Schmidt insisted the picture was meant to serve as a message of hope and not a morbid reminder of a terrible tragedy.
“The picture shows us that there is a positive alternative to death: love,” he added.
The Lampedusa museum has been set up as part of a joint initiative between refugee authorities on the island and the cultural ministries of Italy and Tunisia.
The exhibition will run until October 3rd and displays selected works of art donated by various museums in Italy and Tunisia.
The artwork will be accompanied by photos of refugees as well as objects recovered from the sea during rescue operations in the Mediterranean."

Finally they're on and he wriggles free to put the new footwear to good use: kicking his siblings and friends on the shins.
He might be a refugee, detained in a transit camp with the rest of his family, waiting to hear what the rest of his life might hold in store for him.
But in that moment he is just an irrepressible little boy with new boots.
Ai Weiwei chuckles at the memory of the scene, one of many warmly humorous moments that he captured on film as part of ""Human Flow"", an epic 23-country documentary essay on the global refugee crisis which required a crew of 200 people to put together and has its international premiere at the Venice film festival on Friday.

It is the kind of humanizing detail that the celebrated Chinese artist finds lacking in mainstream media coverage of the migration story that has dominated news agendas over recent years in much of the world.
""It is a challenge when you are making a film,"" Ai told AFP in Venice.
""You see daily news footage about the tragedies. But after you do some studies you realise that those footages are all the same. It is about shocking, it is about violence, it is about crisis.
""Our film is different. It is trying to give refugees a more historical (context), humanity and to relate to daily life: how a woman holds her child, how a child puts on his shoes, how a man is lighting a cigarette.
""All those details relate to everyone. You can understand they are human, even in these conditions that you cannot imagine.""
Lesbos to Gaza
Journalism, he says, has for a long time been too keen to pursue stories around the most shocking images available. And when it comes to refugees, ""it has not talked deeply about who they are and what the reason is for them being where they are"".
Ai's film takes him on a journey from Lesbos, the Greek island that was at the frontline of Europe's migration crisis when the film was made in 2016, to Kenya's huge Dadaab refugee camp, via the slums of Gaza, the Afghan-Pakistan border area and the battlefields of Iraq, before ending up on the US-Mexico border that President Donald Trump has promised to turn into ""a beautiful wall"".
Ai has addressed the refugee issue in his work before, notably when he wrapped Berlin's Konzerthaus in thousands of orange life vests recovered from Lesbos and by using his own body to recreate an image of Aylan Kurdi, the Syrian toddler whose washed-up corpse provided one of the current crisis's defining images.
""I tried almost desperately to make a shout, to make my voice heard,"" Ai says of his previous work.
""But I realized that is not enough for myself to understand the topic. It is so broad and has such deep history, such complexity.
""So I decided to make a film: it is a journey to show how I learned and what, and to have the possibility to show other people.""

Ai has produced several documentaries before but this is first attempt at making an essay in film on a global scale, with the final product merging text, often poetry, and still photography with the moving images.
""You don't watch this film, you experience it,"" says the executive producer, Andrew Cohen.
""It is not didactic or polemical - it does not preach or take sides. Weiwei is not a fancy reporter with an nflated ego. He is a lifelong refugee himself with a down-to-earth approach that brings us directly in to the experience.""
Ai, who has been an outspoken critic of the Chinese government, was held under house arrest without charge for three months in 2011 and banned from travelling outside China until 2015. He is now based in Berlin.

					17:14 CET+01:00				",AFP,Italian refugee doc wows Berlin film festival,"A searing Italian documentary on Europe's refugee influx drew cheers Saturday at the Berlin film festival, which has rolled out the red carpet for pictures offering unique takes on the crisis.
""Fire at Sea"" by award-winning director Gianfranco Rosi, set on the Mediterranean island of Lampedusa, emerged as an early favourite among 18 contenders for the festival's Golden Bear top prize, to be awarded by jury president Meryl Streep on February 20.
The film provides an unflinching look at the thousands of desperate people who arrive on the island each year trying to enter the European Union, and the thousands more who have died trying.
But Rosi, who spent several months on Lampedusa making the documentary, also offers a tender portrait of the rhythms of daily life in Lampedusa's ancient fishing villages and efforts of local people to help those in need.
""It bears witness to a tragedy that is happening right before our eyes,"" Rosi told reporters following a enthusiastically received press preview.
""I think we are all responsible for that tragedy and perhaps after the Holocaust, it is the greatest tragedy we have ever seen in Europe.""
The picture is told through the eyes of a 12-year-old local boy, Samuele Pucillo, and a doctor, Pietro Bartolo, who has been tending to the often dehydrated, malnourished and traumatised new arrivals for a quarter-century.
Rosi, who clinched the Venice film festival's 2013 Golden Lion for his film ""Sacro GRA"", also accompanied coastguard rescue missions answering the terrified SOS calls of people on overcrowded boats, most of them arriving from Libya.
They are taken to a reception centre for medical examinations and processing while awaiting transfer to other sites in Italy.
Rosi captures the migrants' overwhelming relief to be on dry land, the shock that gives way to mourning for their dead, and the crushing boredom they break up with rough-and-tumble football games.
In one powerful scene, a Nigerian man recounts the perilous journey to Italy in a call-and-response chant with other African migrants, describing what was for many a deadly trek through the scorching Sahara, and the suffering endured at the hands of Islamic State jihadists and prison guards in Libya.
Bartolo, the doctor, said that he hoped the film would open more Europeans' eyes to the plight visible in Lampedusa every day, as the political debate grows more entrenched.
""I've seen so many terrible things, so many dead children, so many dead women, so many raped women. These things leave you with a great big empty hole in your stomach,"" he said.
""These are nightmares that haunt me very often.""
Tim Robey of London's Daily Telegraph called the film ""pertinent, humane"" and ""shattering"" on Twitter, while Kate Muir of the Times pronounced it ""brilliant"".
Festival director Dieter Kosslick said ahead of the festival that a single theme ran through much of the selection this year: ""the right to happiness -- the right to a home, to love, to self-determination, to life and to survival"".
Hollywood star George Clooney and his wife Amal, a Lebanese-born human rights lawyer, used the occasion of the festival to offer their backing and assistance to Chancellor Angela Merkel in a meeting at her office Friday, after Germany let in 1.1 million asylum seekers last year.
The 11-day cinema showcase is also featuring around a dozen films shining a light on the crisis in various ways.
German documentary ""Havarie"" traces the fate of a small rickety refugee boat in the Mediterranean, spotted by a tourist who made a mobile phone video from a cruise ship.
Danish film ""Those Who Jump"" hands the camera to a Malian migrant trapped in the high-security border facility between the EU and Africa as he and hundreds of other would-be asylum seekers plot their next move.
And Syrian-Iraqi production ""Life of the Border"" allowed eight children in a refugee camp in the Kurdish Syrian town of Kobane to film their own stories.
The festival runs until February 21."

					17:36 CEST+02:00				",AFP,What rules apply to migrants rescued at sea?,"In the standoff between Italy and Malta over a migrant ship stranded in the Mediterranean, both have insisted on their right to refuse a vessel entry to their ports.
Although Spain offered safe harbour to the boat and the 629 migrants on board, the episode has raised questions about a country's legal obligations towards those rescued at sea.
Here are a few key questions.
Are the rules clear?
Generally speaking, no.
""International maritime law does not provide for specific obligations which would determine in all cases which state is responsible to allow disembarkation on its territory,"" the United Nations refugee agency (UNHCR) says.
But that does not mean a country can simply hold up a stop sign and wash its hands of the situation when a vessel packed with vulnerable migrants approaches its shores. UNHCR also pointed to ""key treaties"" stating that a nation which has responsibility for an area in which a search-and-rescue operation takes place is required to ""exercise primary responsibility"" for coordinating the migrants' safe disembarkation.

The International Organization for Migration also said that while states are not forced to accept specific vessels, there is a collective duty to ensure a humane outcome.
""Regarding disembarkation, states are obliged to cooperate to find a safe place to disembark migrants rescued in their search and rescue area,"" IOM spokesman Leonard Doyle told AFP, citing legal experts.
What if there's an emergency on board?
This could arguably compel a state to grant access to its ports.
""If the country has control over the ship and there are migrants in dire straights aboard and no agreement with another state to take them can be found, they should not delay but accept them,"" Doyle said.
In the case of the Aquarius, which is operated by SOS Méditerranée, UNHCR said that the dwindling provisions on board created ""an urgent humanitarian imperative"" for Italy and Malta to allow the boat to dock.
Spain's intervention later appeared to defuse the crisis.
What happens after the migrants disembark?
In an apparent attempt to justify Rome's stance, far-right Interior Minister Matteo Salvini said Italy's new populist government could not be forced to turn the country into ""a huge refugee camp"".
But UNHCR said letting a boat dock did not mean a country would have to take long-term responsibility for those on board.
""A state which allows disembarkation on its territory of rescued persons – particularly in situations involving large numbers of people – need not, in UNHCR's view, be solely responsible for providing durable solutions on its own territory.""

					13:29 CET+01:00				",AFP,"'10,000 refugees' to be relocated from Libya to EU in 2018","Up to 10,000 people stranded in refugee camps and detention centres in Libya could be relocated to Europe in 2018, the Italian government said on Sunday.
The initiative would be part of an attempt by EU countries to address the deteriorating conditions in Libya, where thousands of people are held captive in inhumane conditions.
""In 2018, up to 10,000 refugees will be able to come to Europe without risk, through humanitarian corridors,"" Italian Interior Minister Marco Minniti said in an interview with the newspaper La Repubblica.
The announcement comes after a group of 162 ""vulnerable"" people, from Eritrea, Ethiopia, Somalia and Yemen, were evacuated from Libya and arrived by military plane in Rome on Friday.
The group included single mothers, unaccompanied children and handicapped people, and was the first time refugees and migrants had been relocated directly to Europe by the UN's refugee agency (UNHCR).
About 400,000 migrants are in Libya, including roughly 36,000 children, the UN children's agency UNICEF and the International Organization for Migration (IOM) said earlier this month.
In 2018, the IOM aims to repatriate 30,000 migrants to their home countries as part of a voluntary return programme. Around 15,000 have been sent back this year.
""In accordance with the objectives of the International Organization for Migration, 30,000 migrants without right to asylum will be able to be repatriated to their countries on a voluntary basis,"" in 2018, Minniti said. ""With the help of the Libyan authorities, we have constructed a new management model on the other side of the Mediterranean,"" he added.
Libya has long been a transit hub for migrants seeking a better life in Europe, but people smugglers have stepped up their lucrative business since the chaos following the 2011 revolution.
Last month, US television network CNN broadcast video footage appearing to show migrants being sold as slaves near the Libyan capital Tripoli, sparking international outrage.
International organisations are now able to ""visit reception centres and improve their living conditions,"" Minniti said, adding that the conditions were currently ""unacceptable"".
Italy also needs to take ""credible"" measures to work with the Libyan coastguard to better control the ""illegal"" influx of migrants arriving by sea, he said.
Sea arrivals to Italy are down a third this year, from almost 180,000 people in 2016 to just under 119,000 in 2017, which includes nearly 15,000 unaccompanied children, according to UNICEF and IOM.
Hundreds of people also drowned trying to make the treacherous journey across the Mediterranean.

Italy received the fourth-highest number of registrations from first time applicants across the EU states during the period, according to the data.
At 80,900, or 38 percent, Germany received the most of the total 213,200 requests, followed by Hungary (32,700, or 15 percent) and Austria (17,400, or eight percent).
Italy was followed by France, which registered 14,700 applications, and Sweden, which registered 14,300. The Italy figure was 355 less than in the first quarter.

The Europe-wide ""day of action"" includes dozens of events across several nations with the biggest demonstration expected in London. There are also rival anti-migrant events due to take place, notably in the Czech Republic, Poland and Slovakia.
The biggest mass migration since World War II has divided Europe with Germany pushing for compulsory quotas within the Europe Union but eastern European nations snubbing the proposal.
Pressing his Czech, Hungarian, Polish and Slovakian counterparts at a meeting in Prague, Germany's foreign minister on Friday warned the influx of hundreds of thousands of migrants could be ""the biggest challenge for the EU in its history"".
""If we are united in describing the situation as such, we should be united that such a challenge is not manageable for a single country,"" Frank-Walter Steinmeier said, calling for ""European solidarity"".
The International Organization for Migration said over 430,000 migrants and refugees had crossed the Mediterranean to Europe so far in 2015, with 2,748 dying or going missing en route.
Germany has taken the lion's share, admitting 450,000 refugees so far this year, most of them fleeing violence in the Middle East -- particularly Syria -- and Asia.
But Steinmeier's appeal for EU members to accept proposals to share around 160,000 migrants fell on deaf ears among eastern nations.
Slovak Foreign Minister Miroslav Lajcak said he wanted a solution ""that is not imposed"" but ""made jointly"". ""Migrants don't want to stay in Slovakia,"" he added bluntly.
Denmark's right-wing government also said it would not take part in the quota scheme.
With criticism growing of Hungary's treatment of thousands of people passing through on their way to northern Europe, premier Viktor Orban said he wanted 3.0 billion euros ($3.4 billion) handed to Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan, the first ports of call for Syrians trying to escape conflict.
""If it takes more money, we will increase aid until the refugee flows are drying up,"" Orban told Germany's Bild newspaper.
""These migrants do not come from war zones but from camps (in these border countries), where they were safe.
""They are not fleeing danger -- they have already fled and should not fear for their lives.""
They come to Europe not ""because they seek safety but because they want a better life than in a camp. They want a German life, perhaps a Swedish life"".
Orban's comments come as Hungary builds a fence on the Serbian border to keep migrants out and has adopted tough new laws that will make it a crime to cross the border illegally from next week.
""From September 15, the rules are changing in Hungary, if you cross the border illegally, you will be immediately arrested by the authorities,"" Orban warned Friday.
Orban insisted on Friday that his country was just trying to apply European rules in seeking to register the new arrivals, pinning the blame on fellow EU member Greece for waving migrants through for onward travel north.
EU lawmakers have called for an international conference on migration, together with the United States, United Nations and Arab countries.
Facing criticism that his government has been too slow to help, US President Barack Obama pledged to admit at least 10,000 Syrian refugees over a year starting October 1.
Underscoring the scale of the crisis, some 7,600 migrants entered Macedonia in just 12 hours overnight, according to a UN official, with more buses on their way from Greece.
From Macedonia, the migrant route cuts through Serbia into Hungary and from there veers west into Austria, from where most of the arrivals continue on to Germany and Sweden.
Germany has placed 4,000 troops on standby for this weekend alone to cope with the influx.
From the smugglers who pack migrants into leaky boats, to taxi drivers who charge exorbitant sums to ferry them across land, some people have sought to profit from the migrants' plight.
The French government on Friday suspended an honorary consul in the Turkish resort of Bodrum after she was secretly filmed selling rubber dinghies and life jackets to desperate refugees."

""These refugee camps -- so many are concentration camps, crowded with people... because international accords seem more important than human rights,"" Francis said in impromptu remarks at a ceremony in memory of modern-day Christian martyrs.
Departing from his prepared script and appearing unusually emotional as he spoke, the 80-year-old pontiff said he wanted the woman to be remembered along with all the other martyrs commemorated in Rome's Basilica of St Bartholomew.
He revealed that he had met the woman's husband and their three children during his visit to a refugee camp on the Greek island of Lesbos last year.
""I do not know what happened to him, if he managed to get out of his concentration camp, and get to somewhere else"" Francis said.
""He looked at me and said 'Father, I am a Muslim and my wife was a Christian. In our country we were terrorised ... they saw her crucifix and they asked her to throw it away.
""When she refused they cut her throat in front of my eyes. We loved each other so much.""
Francis did not reveal the man's nationality but most of the migrants in Lesbos at the time of his visit were refugees from the conflict in Syria and he returned to Rome with three families who had fled the conflict there.

They have since begun new lives in Rome and the pope met Saturday with other refugees brought to Europe by legal routes under the auspices of the Sant'Egidio community.
He told them all that Europe needed to be infected by the generous spirit towards migrants that has been shown by the people of Lesbos and the Italian islands of Lampedusa and Sicily.
""We live in a civilisation that is not having children, but also closes its door to migrants: this is called suicide,"" he said.
""Let us think about the cruelty afflicting so many people, about the exploitation of those arriving on boats.
""Italy and Greece are providing a welcome but then international agreements mean they cannot move on.""
Francis also upbraided the growing number of Italian politicians claiming the country cannot cope with an influx which has seen over half a million migrants arrive on its territory in the last three years.
""If every municipality in Italy took in just two migrants there would be a place for everyone,"" he said.
Saturday's service at the Basilica located on an island in the Tiber river that separates most of Rome from the Vatican, was also addressed movingly by Roselyne Hamel.
She is the sister of Jacques Hamel, the 85-year-old priest murdered by jihadists last year as he was celebrating mass in his church in Normandy in northern France.
""At his age, Jacques was frail but he was strong in his faith in Christ, strong in his love for the Gospel,"" Roselyne Hamel said.
Describing her sibling as ""a universal brother,"" she said she was certain his love for humanity would even have extended to his killers.
Other speakers included Francisco Hernandez, a friend of William Quijano, an organiser of ""Schools for Peace"" in El Salvador and a victim of gang violence in 2009, and Karl Schneider, son of Paul Schneider, a protestant pastor who died in the Nazi death camp at Buchenwald.
The Basilica where Saturday's service took place is home to a large collection of relics of Christian martyrs across the ages, including recently added momentoes of Schneider, Quijano and Hamel."

					17:10 CET+01:00				",AFP,Italy to investigate fatal shipwreck with all-female victims,"The bodies of 26 women who drowned attempting the perilous crossing from Libya to Europe were brought to Italy on Sunday, where investigators launched a murder inquiry.
A seemingly endless line of black plastic body bags were lowered by crane from a Spanish ship onto the portside in Salerno, southern Italy, where they were placed in coffins and loaded onto waiting hearses.
Twenty-three of the women died on Friday after the inflatable dinghy they were travelling on sank, and their bodies were recovered by the Spanish ship Cantabria, which was operating as part of the EU anti-trafficking force Sophia.
A Sophia spokesman told AFP another three bodies had been discovered during other life-saving operations in the Mediterranean this week, and transferred to the Cantabria as it headed towards Italy with its grim cargo.
There was no immediate explanation as to why all the dead were women, though the crossing is riskier for them. For every five men who drown in the rubber boats trying to cross the Mediterranean, six women also die, according to migrant expert Sine Plambech, adjunct professor at Columbia University.
They can have poorer swimming skills compared to men and their attempts to save their children often lead to their drowning, as does the heavier clothing they wear, he said
""It's a tragedy. The prosecutor's office will begin looking into it immediately,"" Salerno's prefect Salvatore Malfi said.
""We will need to see whether there are suspects to concentrate on or whether the murder inquiry will proceed against persons unknown,"" he said.
Investigators would be looking for signs of violence against the women, who are believed to have been Nigerian.
""They were on a dinghy that was also carrying men,"" Malfi told Italian media in response to fears the doomed vessel may have been a sex-trade boat carrying victims destined for prostitution.
""The sex trafficking routes are different. Loading women onto a boat is too risky, the traffickers would not do it as they could lose all their 'goods' -- as they describe them -- in one fell swoop,"" he said.
The Cantabria was also carrying 375 migrants rescued from the waves, including 116 women -- nine of whom were heavily pregnant.
According to Italy's interior ministry, more than 111,700 people have reached the country by sea in the first 10 months of 2017, 30 percent down on the previous year.
Despite the drop, traffickers are still sending migrant boats out into the Mediterranean: the International Organization for Migration (IOM) said Friday that more than 2,560 migrants had been saved over four days.
In all, 2,839 people have died while attempting the crossing so far this year, it said.

					10:40 CEST+02:00				", The Local,Refugee aid group decries 'confusion' at Swiss border,"A Swiss aid organization has criticized the situation at the Swiss-Italian border, saying many refugees are left in “confusion and uncertainty”.
Miriam Behrens, director of the Swiss Refugee Council (SFH), travelled to the border at Chiasso and to the Italian city of Como on Wednesday and Thursday to assess the situation of refugees and “ensure that the rights of people looking for protection are entirely guaranteed,” she said in a statement.
Switzerland has been under fire for several weeks after turning back thousands of migrants from the Swiss border.
Any refugee has the right to claim asylum when they reach Switzerland. If they do, they should be registered with the Swiss migration office (SEM) and their application processed in due course. If they do not, because they want to transit through Switzerland and claim asylum in another country such as Germany, the terms of the Dublin agreement state they should be sent back to the first EU country they arrived in, in this case Italy.
In July alone over 3,000 people were sent back from Switzerland to Italy, news agencies said last week.
The Swiss border guards office says it is simply applying the law. However the situation has caused chaos in Como, where many refugees are now sleeping at the train station and in parks after being turned back.
Last week Amnesty International called for clarification from the Swiss after reports that children were being sent back from the border.
Now the SFH says confusion at the border is making it difficult for people to claim asylum.
“People who seek protection are not being sufficiently and correctly informed, which leads to confusion regarding exactly when they can lodge their asylum request,” it said in a statement.
“The situation is difficult for all parties concerned,” it added, saying there should be “more transparency” regarding the procedures in place and the asylum process.
It said Swiss border guards “need much more help” in terms of translators and child protection specialists in order to properly deal with those seeking to place an asylum request.
All those who wish to seek asylum in Switzerland should be put into the care of the SEM “even if there are doubts regarding their motives for seeking asylum”, it added.
While the number of people requesting asylum has gone down across the Schengen zone since last year, its member states do not have a satisfactory solution to the question of refugees in transit, it said.
Mechanisms for the redistribution of refugees were needed “to guarantee the protection of those concerned” and Switzerland should play its part in this, said the SFH.
In a statement on its website, the SEM outlined its policy – which applies to minors as well as adult refugees – and stressed that the border “is not closed”, refuting the claims made by some international media.
Switzerland respects the Dublin agreement and “cannot become a country for the transit of unregulated migration”, said the statement.
“Switzerland has long been seeking a unified European policy regarding asylum.”
“The difficult situation for those concerned at the southern border shows that clearly no single European country can meet the challenge alone – not Italy, not Germany and not Switzerland.”
Europe must find “lasting solutions” by working together, it said."

""This is among the world's most dangerous routes - a journey that no one takes lightly,"" it said, as witnesses described the horror of watching friends and loved ones drown.
After reports on Monday of a shipwreck off the Libya which claimed nearly 130 lives, the UNHCR said dozens of families with children were feared drowned in a separate incident after their boat snapped in two and sank off the North African country.
""According to witnesses, a boat carrying at least 85 people broke in two and sank shortly after setting off from Sabratha on Thursday,"" spokesman Federico Fossi told AFP.

Three wooden boats had set sail together from the conflict-hit country that morning: those travelling on one of them were rescued at sea and brought to Italy, where they described the fate of the other two.
One was intercepted by the Libyan coastguard and towed back to shore, while they saw the other snap in half, throwing many of those onboard into the sea, Fossi said.
""Some survived, later calling people they knew on the first boat to say they had been rescued by the Libyans. We don't know how many others were lost to the waves,"" he said.
There were many families with children from Syria and North Africa among those feared dead.
Migrants brought to Sicily on Monday told aid workers of yet another shipwreck in which seven people had died after falling overboard, including the husband of a pregnant survivor from Cameroon.
""These incidents are a reminder of the grave dangers that people confront when forced to flee their countries because of war and persecution,"" UNHCR's Cecile Pouilly said.
""Since the beginning of the year, over 77,000 people have tried to cross the Mediterranean to Europe,"" said Pouilly, a spokeswoman.
""Despite the heroic work of those involved in rescue at sea, the death toll continues to rise. Close to 2,000 people are reported to have died or gone missing since the start of the year,"" she said.
The UNHCR said it was appealing for ""enhanced"" rescue operations and safe alternatives for those in need of international protection so that people are not compelled to take such dangerous journeys.
It also urged greater international efforts to address the root causes behind the movement of people to Libya - conflicts and poverty - as many of those arriving in the crisis-struck country find it difficult to leave again if not by sea.

More than 2,300 people have died at sea trying to reach Europe since January, many of them Syrians who fled their country's four-and-a-half year conflict.
Sawiris said in a television interview that he would approach the governments of Greece and Italy about his plan.
Asked by AFP whether he believed it could work, he said: ""Of course it's feasible.""
""You have dozens of islands which are deserted and could accommodate hundreds of thousands of refugees.""
Sawiris said an island off Greece or Italy could cost between $10 million (€9 million) and $100 million, but added the ""main thing is investment in infrastructure"".
There would be ""temporary shelters to house the people, then you start employing the people to build housing, schools, universities, hospitals.
""And if things improve, whoever wants to go back (to their homeland) goes back,"" said Sawiris, whose family developed the popular El Gouna resort on Egypt's Red Sea coast.
He conceded such a plan could face challenges, including the likely difficulty of persuading Greece or Italy to sell an island, and figuring out jurisdiction and customs regulations.
But those who took shelter would be treated as ""human beings,"" he said. ""The way they are being treated now, they are being treated like cattle.""

Turkey, in exchange for Ankara's help stemming the flow of migrants, after resolving a dispute with Italy.
Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi had stalled on signing off on the deal because of questions about how the accord would work, but EU sources told AFP that Rome had given its approval on Wednesday.
Under the deal the European Commission, the EU executive, will contribute €1 billion to Turkey while the bloc's 28 member states will contribute two billion, the commission announced.
Germany is the country making the biggest contribution to the fund with €427 million, followed by Britain with €327 million and France with €309 million, EU sources said.
""I welcome the agreement by the Member States on the details of the refugee facility for Turkey,"" European Commission Vice President Frans Timmermans said in a statement.
""The money we are putting on the table will directly benefit Syrian refugees in Turkey, helping to improve their access to education and healthcare in particular.
""I also welcome the measures already taken by the Turkish authorities to give Syrian refugees access to the labour market and to reduce the flows.""
Turkey - the main launching point for the one million refugees and migrants who arrived in Europe last year - has promised to cut the flow of people as part of the deal agreed with the EU at a summit in November.
Italian barbs
The deal comes four days after Renzi and German Chancellor Angela Merkel held talks to break the logjam on the deal with Turkey.
Italy had questioned how much of the money should come from the EU budget, and how much control the bloc will have over how Ankara spends the funds.
Renzi has also traded barbs with Brussels about claims that Italy has been slow to set up so-called ""hotspot"" centres for registering and taking photos and fingerprints of newly arrived migrants.
But in a diplomatic show of unity on Friday after Renzi repeatedly criticised ""German dominance"" in EU affairs, both leaders said that the migrant crisis can only be solved if the 28 members of the bloc work together.
Across Europe, debate has raged on how to handle the biggest wave of migrants and refugees since World War II, many of them fleeing the war in Syria.
In January alone 360 people drowned while making the risky crossing of the Mediterranean, while more than 3,700 died in 2015, according to the International Organization for Migration.
Greece, where most of the refugees and migrants arrive, is under pressure from Brussels to improve its control of the EU's external borders, although Athens says there is little more it can do.
Italy and Greece were the main beneficiaries of an EU deal last year to redistribute 160,000 refugees around the bloc and ease the burden of frontline states, but only just over 400 have so far been relocated."

					16:02 CEST+02:00				",The Local,Italy is now Europe's top spot for refugee arrivals,"Migrant arrivals to Italy have overtaken arrivals to Greece for the first time since June 2015, according to EU borders' association Frontex.
The agency reported on Friday that 8370 migrants had landed in the central Mediterranean in April, compared to just 2,700 for Greece – figures which mark a stark change in refugee migration patterns.
According to Frontex director, Fabrice Leggeri, Italy's eclipsing of Greece was not down to an increase in arrivals but was instead down to a “drastic reduction” in the number of refugees arriving on the Greek islands.
“The total for all of April is well below the number of people we often saw reaching just the island of Lesbos on a daily basis during last year's peak months,” Leggeri said.
Increased controls at the Greek – Macedonia border as well as recent pact between Greece and Turkey signed in late March that will see Turkey take thousands of asylum seekers from Greece, were both cited as key factors in the stark drop in arrivals.
Frontex emphasized that arrivals to central Europe were actually down 15 percent compared to March and were 50 percent lower than in April 2015.
The news comes as 1,000 refugees came ashore in Italy on Friday, having been picked up in the Mediterranean by four separate rescue vessels over the past 48 hours.
The Sicilian port of Augusta is expecting to see some 342 disembark while 250 are scheduled to come ashore in Catania and 173 at the islands capital, Palermo.
A further 233 were set to come ashore in Crotone, Calabria.
According to Frontex, the majority of arrivals to Central Europe in April were of Eritrean, Egyptian and Nigerian origin – compared to Syrian nationals which made up the majority of all arrivals to Greece."

					09:24 CEST+02:00				",The Local,EU's refugee plans need a reality check,"The EU this week outlined plans to resettle and relocate refugees, but one expert taking a closer look at the proposals argues they put the rights of migrants and asylum seekers at risk.
By Katharine Jones, Coventry University, for The Conversation.
The European Commission has announced that it will embark on an unprecedented mandatory emergency “relocation” of 40,000 Syrian and Eritrean refugees. The Commission proposes that women, men and children who arrive in Greece and Italy who “are in clear need of international protection” will be relocated to other EU member states. States will be offered €6,000 per individual relocated.
A bold plan driven by Jean-Claude Juncker, head of the Commission, the initiative gives life to proposals within the long-awaited EU Agenda on Migration, announced on May 13th. Prompted by the scores of deaths among migrants in the Mediterranean and a clamour from Greece and Italy for EU assistance, the plan also leaves open the possibility of a future relocation scheme, meaning that other states might yet find themselves suddenly dealing with a clutch of new arrivals.
Trailing his initiative in a speech to the European Parliament on April 23rd, Juncker argued that “We cannot leave it solely to the member states directly concerned to manage the relocation of refugees. What we need is shared solidarity.”
This grand language of solidarity and humanitarianism is all very well – but a reality check is needed.
Relocation, not resettlement
Although branded as an “emergency response”, the relocation scheme will in fact be spread over two years. This equates to about 1,500 people per month.
To put these numbers into context, more than 200,000 people reached the EU by sea in 2014, four times the number arriving in 2013. According to the International Organisation for Migration (IOM), so far in 2015, almost 78,000 people have reached the EU by sea from Libya and Egypt, with the vast majority landing in Greece or Italy. These numbers are almost certainly an enormous underestimation of the people who set out but die on the way.
Worse still, only refugees arriving in Greece and Italy after April 15th 2015 will qualify. Refugees arriving before this date cannot be included, leaving thousands languishing in terrible conditions in overcrowded reception centres in landing sites with civil society organizations struggling to provide services or to be returned.
In another little-reported limitation, under the relocation scheme, EU member states are not being required to resettle individuals permanently, but only to process their asylum claims through their national systems. The commission proposes that the Italian and Greek authorities screen arrivals for those who appear to be “prima facie in clear need of international protection” with the assistance of the European Asylum Support Office (EASO) and “other relevant agencies” (as yet undefined).
In other words, only those who can quickly demonstrate in potentially terrible reception centre conditions that they would be covered under the terms of the 1951 Refugee Convention will be relocated. Others will either be returned through a voluntary process or be deported. Relocation is not resettlement.
No guarantees
The relocation quota is based on an article of the Lisbon Treaty, in effect since 2009 but little understood by the general public. The article states:
In the event of one or more member states being confronted by an emergency situation characterized by a sudden inflow of nationals of third countries, the Council, on a proposal from the Commission, may adopt provisional measures for the benefit of the member state(s) concerned. It shall act after consulting the European Parliament.
The proposed scheme's implications are far-reaching and possibly permanent. In this climate of proposed naval “pushbacks” and proposals for extraterritorial asylum processing, forced relocation of this nature and on this scale would be a major challenge to the existing global refugee regime.
Under the proposals, member states will be proportionally allocated refugees depending on their population, total GDP, unemployment rate, the average number of spontaneous asylum applications they receive, and the number of refugees they resettled between 2010–2014.
For it to proceed, a two-thirds majority of member states must agree. While Germany and Sweden have expressed support for the scheme; others have been reticent or outright hostile. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban rather bombastically proclaimed:
It is a mad idea for someone to let refugees into their own country instead of defending their borders and then to say I will redistribute them among you. This is an unfair and indecent proposal. We therefore cannot support it.
Facing an upcoming election in which anti-immigration sentiment is overwhelming, Denmark is exercising its opt-out, allowed under Protocols associated with the Lisbon Treaty. The UK and Ireland have a right to opt in under the same protocols – and while Ireland is opting in, the British government's response to the current proposals on relocation and resettlement is unsurprisingly deeply negative.
Dire need
The proposed relocation scheme responds to the concerns of EU member states about “burden-sharing” and preventing any more migrants entering their territory rather than putting individuals' rights first, despite the humanitarian rhetoric.
Those who successfully make it to Italy and Greece will have their claims for asylum screened at speed before they are “distributed” to any country which has agreed to participate. While little research has been done on the motivations and journeys of these “boat people”, we know that individuals arriving in Greece and Italy from countries such as Eritrea and Syria are in dire need of humanitarian protection.
Equally, we must not forget that the EU Agenda on Migration also contains new security measures aimed at vastly enhancing external border controls. These are designed precisely to keep migrants out of the EU.
Plans have already been presented to systematically identify, capture and destroy vessels used by smugglers in facilitating migrants across the Mediterranean as well as even potentially deploying ground forces in Libya.
This increased tendency to treat migration and asylum as security issues is undoubtedly the EU's real agenda – and it inevitably puts the rights of migrants and asylum seekers themselves at risk.

Clubs from Germany, Scotland and Spain have already launched fund-raising initiatives, with Bundesliga giants Bayern Munich notably announcing a donation of one million euros ($1.1m).
Roma, the Serie A runners-up for the past two seasons, have labelled their initiative ""Football Cares"" and on Tuesday club president James Pallotta will kick things off by making a ""large donation"", according to the league's official website, www.legaseriea.it.
A statement by Roma said: ""Football has the power to reach millions and by uniting for 'Football Cares', we can make a real difference no matter how small an individual donation is.""
Fans can make a donation to the cause on the JustGiving platform. Roma said all money raised will go to the United Nations Refugee Agency, Save The Children, International Rescue Committee and the Red Cross.
United Nations (UN) estimates put the number of people being driven out of their homes by persecution and war at 60 million.
Germany's Bundesliga clubs have been particularly proactive in launching initiatives.

The Europen Commission is set on opening proceedings against Italy, Greece, Malta and Croatia for violating regulations on taking fingerprints from migrants entering their shores, Rai News reported, citing diplomatic sources in Brussels.
But Mario Morcone, the head of the immigration department at Italy's interior ministry, told The Local on Wednesday that the data on which the EC is basing the potential sanctions against Italy over its handling of asylum seekers is out of date.
""It needs to be clarified,"" he said, adding that since the beginning of January, Italy had formally identified 80 percent of asylum seekers.
“Italy has saved over 200,000 migrants from the sea over the past couple of years. We have done a lot and for this, we are very proud.”
Interior Minister Angelino Alfano said on Wednesday that it would be “unreasonable” for the commission to open the proceedings.
“For the work we've done, the only thing we deserve from the EU is a thank you,” he was quoted by Ansa as saying.
Morcone said in late September that the collection of fingerprints would be stepped up at refugee centres, or so-called “hotspots”, that were to be jointly run by European officials and local police.
A bitterly contested deal agreed by EU member states that month on relocating migrants across Europe from countries that have borne most of the burden, such as Italy and Greece, was dependent on asylum requests being swiftly processed.
But just one such centre has opened so far on Lampedusa, an island off Sicily which has been a focal point of arrival for migrants crossing from North Africa.
“We plan to open others but they're still going through the political processes,” Morcone said.
Of the nearly 860,000 migrants to land in Europe so far this year, over 130,000 have arrived in Italy.
Some 4,600 people were rescued off the coast of Libya last weekend after a break in bad weather sparked fresh attempts at the perilous crossing. Over 3,500 have died trying to make the crossing this year.
In the past, Italy had failed to formally identify thousands of refugees, mostly because they refused to be fingerprinted in order to bypass the Dublin regulation, which forces refugees to stay in the country where they first submitted their asylum request.
Of the 122,000 migrants who arrived in Italy between January and September, only 80,000 agreed to be identified, according to figures from the Italian police.
Morcone said Italy still struggles to get migrants to go through the identification process.
“Some Syrians refuse, but it's mostly Eritreans,” he added.
“We're now trying to educate them to see that it's important that they be identified and that their movement within Europe is dependent on it.”
Meanwhile, the EU refugee relocation plan agreed in September has lagged. Some 80 refugees were supposed to leave Italy each day as part of a plan that would see 40,000 relocated over two years, but less than 150 have reportedly left over the past few months.
Although nine EU countries had volunteered to take in 854 people from Italy, Morcone said that the country had only received offers for about 350."

Allegations by Frontex that donor-funded rescue vessels may have colluded with traffickers at the end of last year prompted Italian prosecutors to begin an informal investigation into their funding sources.
""The declarations by Frontex and political authorities are intended to discredit our actions and erode our donors' trust,"" said Proactiva Open Arms head Riccardo Gatti.
""They are trying to say that we support the smuggling or the traffickers themselves,"" he said.
In a report cited in December by the Financial Times daily, Frontex raised the possibility that traffickers were putting migrants out to sea in collusion with the private ships that recover them and bring them to Italy ""like taxis"".
Prosecutors then publicly wondered at the amount of money being spent, though they stopped short of opening a formal probe.
""We feel there's someone who wants to put a spoke in our wheels, though we do not really know who is behind it,"" Gatti said.
The organization said it had nothing to hide.
""We have 35,000 donors. Some are well known - like Pep Guardiola, the current manager of Manchester City - others are anonymous,"" said Oscar Camps, Proactiva Open Arms director.
He said the group had so far received 2.2 million euros ($2.3 million) in donations for an op in the Med that costs between 5,000 euros and 6,000 euros a day.
Pro-Activa Open Arms also heavily criticized a deal signed in February between Italy and Libya which purportedly hopes to stem the flow of migrants from the coast of North Africa to Italy.
Gatti said the deal was made with only part of the 1,700 militias he said control Libya and would therefore be ineffective. Human rights watchers have also warned the accord would put the lives of those fleeing persecution and war in greater danger.
""Everything is controlled by the militias in Libya, even the coast guard, and 30 percent of the financial flows in the country come from human trafficking,"" he said.
The deal is in doubt after it was suspended in March by Tripoli's Court of Appeal.

Two families had even transferred their children to another school after learning of the arrival of the migrant children, lawyer Maria Antonella Taccori, who acts as a guardian for one of the boys, told The Local.
Parents had protested after the two boys, aged nine and 11, joined the private Our Lady of Mercy school in Cagliari.
Both boys are orphans who arrived in Sardinia last summer after being rescued during an attempted crossing of the Mediterranean Sea. They are living with host families on the island, with lawyers (Taccori and Marina Bardanzellu) acting as their legal guardians, as is the standard procedure for unaccompanied minors.
""There was discontent and prejudice among a minority of the parents and - it's unfortunate but it's the truth - among the children too, some of whom refused to use the same toilet as the new children,"" said Taccori.
Teachers at the school allocated one of the toilets of the fifth class to the two new boys only, while the other was to be used by the Italian students, as a 'precautionary' measure intended to placate parents. When contacted by The Local, a school secretary said that the school's staff were not giving interviews to the media.
When they heard about the segregation, Bardanzellu and Taccori called a meeting with the parents of the boys' classmates to explain they did not pose any health risk. All migrants who arrive on Italian shores immediately undergo health checks, and both boys had medical certificates from Italy's public health authority (ASL).
""It was definitely a case of misinformation, but also prejudice - at the first meeting, even though we gave all the information; the children's stories, medical certificates and so on, some parents still didn't trust us. We reassured them but the discontent continued to show,"" Taccori explained, and even after a second meeting with parents of all children at the school, a minority continued to complain.
""They claimed they should have been told before the children joined the school, but why should they be informed only when foreign children join? The school is open to everyone. It's a problem of acceptance,"" explained the lawyer.
However, while some parents were unhappy at the enrollment of the two boys, others were concerned by the teachers' reaction. ""This is true racism - it seems like Apartheid is back,"" one mother with children at the school told La Stampa. ""We want our children to be educated about acceptance.""
Taccori said that after the meetings, there has been more openness in the school, and the students are being more welcoming to their new classmates, who are now able to use the same toilets as everyone else.
""The situation is improving every day,"" said Taccori, clearly proud of the boys. ""The teachers have been very welcoming and the boys are very intelligent, they're starting to speak Italian and they're always smiling."""

Centre-right mayor Arturo Cerulli has openly rejected growing political pressure for councils to do more to welcome the thousands of asylum seekers landing in Italy and help to ease the worsening refugee crisis.
“We don’t want refugees here, we don’t have the facilities for them,” Cerulli told The Local on Friday. “We don’t know where to put them, we don’t know what to do with them.”
Cerulli, 60, is a former nuclear engineer and aligned with the New Centre-Right party (NCD) of interior minister, Angelino Alfano.
During his engineering career he travelled extensively to countries including Saudi Arabia, Indonesia and the US, and is married to an Indonesian woman.
He converted to Islam 27 years ago but insists his refusal to welcome asylum seekers is unaffected by his religion.
“Religion has nothing to do with it,” Cerulli said. “I am speaking as the mayor, not as a global citizen. I have to take care of my area, my citizens. I would not know where to put refugees.
“If we accept six people, then they will send another six and then 20 more.”
Monte Argentario on the Tyrrhenian coast near Grosseto is a stunning peninsula that includes popular holiday resort towns of Porto Ercole and Porto Santo Stefano.
With its panoramic views across the Tuscan Archipelago, the peninsula is popular with foreign and Italian holidaymakers and the population swells from 13,000 to more than 30,000 in the summer months.
“Here it’s full of the ‘radical chic’, left-wing intellectuals,” Cerulli said. “Let them open up their beautiful villas and welcome them if they think it’s better.”
Cerulli has recently come under attack from centre-left regional politician Leonardo Marras who accused the mayor of failing to respect the principles of his Islamic faith.
“Muslims like all the faithful believe in hospitality as a model of human relations,” Marras said in an open letter published in several Italian newspapers in August.
“Is your refusal based on objective reasons or prejudice?”
In July, Enrico Rossi, the President of the Tuscany region and Sara Biagiotti, head of the National Association of Italian Municipalities (Anci) wrote to 146 local mayors urging them to welcome more immigrants.
“Rossi continues to send circulars demanding all the councils do their part,” Cerulli added. “And what if I am opposed to that? What’s he going to do, treat me badly?”
He told The Local it was up to the national government to resolve the crisis instead of transferring the problem to local councils and individual mayors.
According to the latest figures, more than 100,000 immigrants have arrived in Italy in 2015."

					08:26 CEST+02:00				",AFP,EU ministers fail to reach refugee quotas deal,"EU interior ministers failed to reach
unanimous agreement on Monday on a plan for binding quotas to relocate 120,000
refugees and take the strain off Greece, Italy, and Hungary, officials said.
""Yes, not everyone is on board at the moment,"" Luxembourg minister Jean Asselborn told a press conference in Brussels after an emergency meeting.
He said however that there was a ""large majority"" in favour of the redistribution in principle, and they would return to the issue in October.
German interior minister Thomas de Maiziere said there was a ""bitterness"" over the fact that a unanimous vote was not possible on Monday, and that a majority vote would have to be held later.
EU migration commissioner Dimitris Avramopoulos added: ""For our proposal on 120,000 we did not have the agreement we wanted.""
The ministers were discussing plans unveiled last week by European Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker to redistribute 120,000 refugees from overstretched Greece, Italy and Hungary.
The plans face fierce opposition from many eastern European member states.
Slovak interior minister Robert Kalinak said his country, the Czech Republic and others refused to back the plan, and called for a summit of EU leaders.
""There was no consensus, several countries disagreed. It was not only us or the Czech Republic, but other countries as well,"" he was quoted as saying by the Czech news agency CTK.
""When other interior ministers also say this issue is about the European Union, it is up to the European countries' leaders to talk about it. This is crucial in my opinion.""
The ministers did formally agree, however, to launch a plan first proposed in May to relocate 40,000 asylum seekers from Greece and Italy over the next two years, according to quotas suggested by the Commission.
Avramopoulos said there had been ""very heated debates at national and a European level.""
""The commission is determined to take action. We will need another council meeting in the coming days,"" he said.
The quotas can be passed by a qualified majority, rather than unanimously, under complex EU rules, but that would show a sign of disunity that the bloc can ill afford.
EU Vice President Frans Timmermans said the ""numbers (being accepted) today are much too small"" and warned of the growing risk to refugees as winter draws near."

refugee family from Damascus in a Vatican apartment, aides revealed on Friday.
The Christian family is the first of two that the Catholic leader has promised to find space for as part of a broader Church effort to help shape Europe's response to the ongoing migration crisis, partly caused by the conflict in Syria.
The family arrived in Italy on September 6th, the day the pope called on every Catholic parish across Europe to find space for at least one family of refugees.
The family arrived in Italy on September 6, the day the pope called on every Catholic parish across Europe to find space for at least one family of refugees.
The family being housed in the Vatican is to remain anonymous until Italian authorities have ruled on their asylum request.
As Christians who have fled a Syria wracked by a deadly civil war and the persecution of minorities, they are highly likely to be quickly granted leave to remain in Italy.
The processing of their application could however take months, possibly years, unless they are made a special case.
In his call for the Church to take a lead on the migration issue, Francis urged local communities of believers to make a ""concrete gesture"" ahead of a Jubilee Year of Mercy starting in December.
He said ""every parish, every religious community, every monastery, every sanctuary in Europe,"" should take part.
""Faced with the tragedy of tens of thousands of asylum-seekers fleeing death (as) victims of war and hunger who are hoping to start a new life, the gospel calls on us and asks us to be the neighbour of the smallest and the most abandoned, to give them concrete hope,"" he said in a Sunday address in St Peter's square.
The Argentinian pontiff has made the fate of society's weakest, including the hundreds of thousands of migrants arriving in Europe, the dominant theme of his papacy.
His call for a grassroots response to the crisis has been widely praised and he acknowledged that initiatives across Europe had inspired him, comparing them to a biblical miracle in which which Jesus heals a deaf and mute man.
""We have been healed of the deafness of selfishness and the silence of retreating into ourselves,"" he said.
""The closed couple, the closed family, the closed group, the closed parish, the closed country, that comes from us, it has nothing to do with God.""
The fate of migrants is also expected to be a theme in the pope's visit to the United States next week.
Since taking office in 2013, Francis has also stepped up the Vatican's support for the homeless living within its walls and across Rome, notably by having showers installed in public toilets in St Peter's square.
And he has personally eschewed the Vatican palace and summer residence he could have occupied in favour of a modest boarding house."

					11:24 CET+01:00				",The Local,Refugees in Italy revolt over lack of Wi-Fi,"A group of refugees in the north of Italy have emptied their rubbish into the streets, furious that their requests for a cleaner and Wi-Fi have not been met.
The 24 protesting refugees from sub-Saharan Africa have been asking for somebody to help maintain order at the duplex villa in the town of Ceranova, where they have been housed since the summer.
They are also upset that Wi-Fi has not been installed in the villa, meaning they can't make Skype calls to their relatives back home, La Repubblica reported.
The protests first took place late last week when the town's refugees blocked main roads to get their message across.
The situation soon took a turn for the worse when the refugees began to tip their rubbish on to the sleepy town's main streets to make their point.
The scene led to heated arguments between the refugees and members of the local community and the town's mayor, Alessandro Grieco, had to intervene personally with the help of three police officers to defuse the situation.
“Obviously it's very important for refugees to have access to the internet and not just so they can stay in touch with their families,” Barbara Spezzi, who manages a refugee center near Turin, told The Local.
""The internet helps refugees keep updated with what's going on at home and in Italy, which helps them integrate into Italian life. It's also a great learning tool too: we had a case of a girl who was following her university lectures on YouTube.""
As news of the protests spread, it became a national issue, having been seized upon by Italy's anti-immigration Northern League party.
Outspoken party leader, Matteo Salvini, even joked about sending the left-wing journalist, politician and leader of the Chamber of Deputies, Laura Boldrini, to clean up the migrants' mess.
“They want someone to clean their homes – can you believe it?"" Salvini asked reporters. ""To keep them happy, let's send Boldrini.""
Since last week's protests, Grieco has called a meeting with the regional prefect, and expelled the ringleader of the protests, a 24-year-old man, from the refugee facility.
""Until now nothing bad had happened and we are looking into the incident. The migrants have obviously flagged up a few issues for them but this is not the way to draw attention to them.
""We absolutely won't tolerate protests like this."""

					08:47 CET+01:00				",The Local,Italian town looks to refugees for revival,"Across Italy, hundreds of towns are struggling to survive amid a dwindling population. But in Satriano, a town in Calabria, refugees are bringing in new life, as the Italian journalist Simone d'Antonio discovers.
The population of this town located in the toe of Italy's “boot” is shrinking as its residents get older.
The narrow streets climbing the hills of the old town are lined with empty houses marked vendesi — for sale. The central square is nearly empty at midday — just a couple of shops remain open. The biggest commotion in town happens each day at 8am, noon and 4pm. That's when a loud siren blares to commemorate bombings during the Second World War, which many of the residents are old enough to remember.
At its peak in the 1950s, the old town of Satriano had about 3,800 residents. Today it's down to about 1,000. If it shrinks much more, schools, health clinics and the local post office may have to be closed.
So when a flood of refugees began pouring into Europe last year — some of them on boats landing on Mediterranean beaches not far from here — local leaders saw it as a great opportunity. In Italy, the job of settling and integrating asylum seekers belongs to local governments. Mayors across the impoverished southern region of Calabria, and especially here in Satriano, are embracing this responsibility in a big way.
Local officials in Satriano are enthusiastically situating refugees in temporary housing, lining them up with jobs and assisting them with their applications for asylum. The hope is that the refugees, most of them men in their 20s, will choose to stay here rather than making their way north to more prosperous parts of Italy or on to Germany, Sweden or the UK. Perhaps they'll bring their families, buy some of those empty houses and make a life here.
“The presence of refugees can be an opportunity to repopulate the town,” says Satriano Mayor Michele Drosi. “It can create a virtuous cycle.”
The results of Satriano's welcoming attitude remain modest — about 20 refugees are currently living here, hardly enough to reverse decades of decline. But Satriano's inclusive policies are a model for the kind of approach cities and towns across Europe are going to have to consider as they absorb the 8,000 refugees and migrants arriving on the continent each day. And it may just work, at least for some of the people passing through.
“If I find a good job I will be happy to stay here,” says Adnan from Pakistan, who is working as an apprentice for a local hairdresser. Adnan came to Satriano after spending three months in Pescara, a larger city in central Italy. “I prefer the dimension of life of a smaller town. And also the cohabitation with people from different ethnic backgrounds, such as the guys from African countries hosted here, is working well.”
An understanding community
Embracing outsiders comes easy for the residents of Satriano because many migrated themselves in their younger days. In the 1950s and ‘60s, hundreds of locals left for Switzerland, Germany and Argentina to find work. Those who returned can sympathize with the young men coming here now, mainly from Pakistan, Mali and Burkina Faso.
As Carmine Battaglia, president of the local association of seniors, puts it: “Who better than us, who left town because of poverty as young workers, to understand the pain of those people fleeing wars and persecutions?”
Satriano is part of a national network of 376 municipalities called SPRAR — the Protection System for Refugees and Asylum Seekers. The network was created by the Italian Ministry of Home Affairs, is funded by the national government and European Union and is managed by a central office led by the Italian Association of Cities.
The model in Satriano is a good example of what SPRAR calls an accoglienza integrata, or “integrated welcome.” Like other cities and towns in Italy, Satriano receives €35 per day per refugee it hosts — the money comes from the Home Affairs Ministry. A local cooperative known as Globe Media manages the project on behalf of the municipality. Globe is staffed almost exclusively by former migrants who have attained Italian citizenship, including its president, Khalid Elsheikhe, who came to Italy from Sudan in the early 1990s. Globe helps refugees buy food, find housing and learn how to speak and write Italian. They also help refugees write applications for asylum, collect the necessary papers and coach them on what to say during their official interview.
While the asylum process plays out — it can take six months to a year — Globe helps the refugees line up jobs. Some find work with the municipality doing street cleaning, gardening or maintenance in municipally owned buildings. Others have received work grants that allow them to work in a private enterprise but get paid by the municipality — the employer must agree to offer job training. This is the basis by which Adnan from Pakistan is working at the hairdresser; another refugee is working in a factory that makes doors and windows while two others have jobs in agriculture.
For most of the newcomers, finding work is the most important determinant of whether they'll stay in Satriano or move on to parts of Europe where jobs are more plentiful. One refugee named Abdullah, from Mali, told me he was happy to clean streets for the municipality — “it gave me the opportunity to live in close contact with residents and feel better integrated here.”
But Abdullah admits he may move elsewhere if his asylum papers come through as he hopes. “It will be fundamental to find a good job if I want to settle here in Italy,” he says. “Once I get the status of refugee, I will go where I can find a job.”
Globe Media's Elsheikhe says even those who leave Satriano may return some day. “We are still in contact with some of the refugees who passed by here and settled in UK cities such as Manchester,” Elsheikhe says. “Some of them say that their desire is to gain enough money to open a shop or a restaurant in Satriano and come back to live here.”
Expansion plans
For now, most of the refugees in Satriano live in a renovated historic building called the Palazzo Condò. The municipality used European Union funds to fix up the old building, which is located next to Satriano's biggest church. There's 20 beds to host refugees here. The basement is now being restored to host a daytime center for elderly residents. It was a deliberate choice to have the refugees and seniors share the same building, intended to spark conversations and common understanding.
Some of that has been happening organically already. The local association of seniors invited refugees along on social outings for its members, including a mountain excursion. Some younger people in town brought refugees to a football match in a neighboring town. Residents are hosting asylum seekers for dinner in their homes, or offering free car rides between the old town to a newer section of Satriano near the Mediterranean Sea. (The carpooling is part of longstanding system locals use among themselves to help students or others without cars to get around — public transport is lacking in this part of Italy.)
Satriano hopes to grow its program by renovating some of the empty houses in town into new shelters to host even more asylum seekers. The houses would be used either on a temporary basis for people passing through, or perhaps be rented out directly to those who choose to stay.
There's fair reason to doubt whether Satriano's plans will work — there simply may not be enough jobs here to convince large numbers of immigrants to stick around. But with Satriano's hospitality, the immigrants are sure to at least give it careful consideration.
“We aim to get this process of integration even better,” says Mayor Drosi. “We want to make the asylum seekers really feel like citizens of Satriano and part of the local community.”

					08:48 CEST+02:00				",,Romantic poet John Keats: An economic refugee to Italy?,"In Rome, the Keats-Shelley house where the British Romantic poets once lived hosted an art workshop for refugees, artists, and volunteers, to discuss what it means to leave one country for another. They discovered surprising parallels between Keats' journey and their own, writes Dr Amanda Frances Johnson.
The great sensualist Romantic poet John Keats arrived in Rome in late 1820 with his friend, painter Joseph Severn. This was not to be a grand tour of Italy in the typical sense. Fortune did not smile on Keats's lungs or his bank balance; one year later he was dead. Passionate letters from sweetheart Fanny Brawne lay unopened and were buried with him, as he requested, in the tranquil oasis of the English Cemetery in Rome. How surprised young Keats would be to see his last home, a cheap rental in its day, become a dynamic museum, filled, not just with tourists and poetry lovers, but with artists and refugees.

Some, like Rome-based art therapist Helen Creswell, consider Keats to have been both a health and an economic refugee. The poet fled creditors and poverty in England but his doctors had also recommended that he soujourn in a warmer climate to help his deteriorating Tuberculosis condition. And so he famously undertook a difficult journey by boat and land, finally arriving in Rome on a cold mid-November afternoon in 1820 after ten days in quarantine in Naples. Keats took lodging in the “English Ghetto”, an area that had attracted English artists and writers since the 1760s; sons and daughters of the ascendant middle and upper classes also came on educational grand tours, sending crates of real and fake antiquities home.
These days, the journey to Italy by boat, even where that journey finds its terminus in the eternal city, has a different cast, being a common, perilous quest for many economic refugees and asylum seekers. The politics too has become perilous as Italy strains under the economic and social weight of assisting more settled migrants than any other EU country. UNCHR figures from August 2017 suggest that 97,377 refugees and asylum seekers have landed at Italian ports with over 2000 deaths sustained from Mediterreanean sea crossings. In literature, the trope of the courageous quest has been with us since Virgil's epic poem the Aeneid (19 BC) in which King Aeneas and his tattered band of survivors seek repatriation in Italy via Scylla and Sicily.

I recently visited Rome to research and update ideas of the “grand tour” in relation to mass people movements, hoping eventually to create a body of poems that contest negative stereotypes of refugees. Fieldwork opportunities included volunteering at the Joel Nafuma Refugee Centre in Rome and dialogue with individual refugees and asylum seekers, NGO staff and art therapy organisations. One workshop made a particular impact.
In June 2017, the Southern Italian art therapy organisation, Art and Seek, partnered with the Keats-Shelley House in Piazza di Spagna to run a special workshop for refugees, migrants and artists: “Art and Seek: The Journey from Romantic Times until Now”. Volunteers and staff working for refugee organisations in Rome were also invited to participate.
Keats's monastic bedroom. A. Frances Johnson
Like good tourists, we took a tour of iconic rooms where Keats and Severn, lived and worked (and died, in Keats's case, on the wintry night of February 23rd, 1821, his famously monastic single bed intact in the tiny upper floor bedroom). Workshop participants were then invited to create a large artwork based on found, large scale maps of the world. A collage by contemporary painter and filmmaker William Kentridge was used to trigger responses, particularly the image of a silhouetted man on a map struggling to carry his furniture on his back. Following Kentridge's powerful image, we made shapes out of black card, talismans of something that had been important to us on our respective journeys.
We then drew over large, colourful print-outs of world maps with modest means (markers and black paper, scissors and glue), depicting journeys made thus far. The maps filled with skewed, competitive lines of latitude and longitude. Erratic diversions from this grid indicated how some had been transferred from refugee camp to camp across Northern Africa before landing at Libyan ports for embarkation to Italy.

We admired the looping trails, the chaotic journey lines that had finally intersected in Rome, intrigued to ask each other about our places of origin. The lingua franca was English, interspersed with Italian.
Language is the first tool of social, cultural and economic advancement within the host country for newly settled migrants, according to Italian linguist Maria Grazia Guido. Guido has described the particular importance of English as a lingua franca. In a short video posted on YouTube, a British interviewer undertaking vox popoli interviews with people rescued at sea shows one unnamed young man intoning “I like my mum, I like my mum”. The simple repetition of this one English phrase conveys a moving signal of loss, mourning and fear. Repetition drives home that, in his limited English, the young man means to use English verbs he cannot yet find, the verb “to love” and the verb “to miss”.
Church centres around Rome daily pack with newcomers desperate to participate in language programs. As William Maley observes in What is a Refugee?, churches and NGOs are working with refugee communities to compensate for massive failures in the system of states. New arrivals turn up punctually at 8.30am to the Joel Nafuma Refugee Centre at St Pauls Within the Walls for the free language classes run five days a week in windowless, vaulted classrooms below the church. There are never enough volunteer teachers to meet demand. For teachers, classes are joyful but chaotic as people attending have different mother tongues.

But this is not to put an overly optimistic gloss on the experience of arrival and transition. As Maley has observed, “To leave one country for another is a traumatic decision”.
Workshop participant Ali, is an educated, dynamic 25-year-old, recently settled in Rome from Tanzania. While to date, the Italian government had been “very friendly to migrants, with friendly policies and laws', he laments the daily experience of racism that prevents him, as a black man, from being considered for work as a town planner. ""Boredom is an issue for refugees,” he adds. “Boredom and shame”. He spends his time on the fringes of Rome working as a part-time chef in a Swahili restaurant. The outlook is bleak in Italy, with youth unemployment at 40 per cent.
Refugees sleeping rough near the Forum after the Via Curtatone evictions. A. Frances Johnson.
Two months after speaking with Ali, forced evictions of up to 500 mostly Eritrean people from a squat in Rome's Via Curtatone and subsequent refugee protests in nearby Piazza dell'Indipendenza culminated in a show of brute force by police. Nonetheless, ordinary Romans filled the streets to protest the violence and lack of sustainable housing alternatives, while evicted refugees set up sleeping quarters by the Forum's ancient heart, banners insisting on housing as a universal right.
At Keats's House, as we worked and chatted, only weeks before the violence at Piazza Dell'Indipendenza, tourist time flowed about us; sometimes we took a break to peer out the window, marvelling at the sea of tourists surging around and up the Spanish steps. Workshop leader Vivianna Bagnato then asked us a confronting question; how did we see ourselves travelling in the future? Was this an optimistic bridge too far, given Italy's dire economic and employment situation? Or an important opportunity to dream, rarely conferred?
The room went quiet.
But watching a fragment of the Jane Campion film biopic Bright Star (2009), refugee participants became moved and vocal about the separation of the amorous protagonists, John Keats and Fanny Brawne.
The idea of the journey was not the only thing to unite us; ideas of love and loss, and of ordinary difficulty in relationships, were spoken about with heated feeling. In Rome. Keats was lonely for Fanny and mourning the death of his brother Tom; finally, he became too ill to work on that which he loved most: poetry.
“He [John Keats] should never have made the journey,” Mohammad from Afghanistan said, wringing his hands and pointing to locks of Keats's hair, installed in a museum case.
Ali, the same age as Keats when he left England, disagreed, averring that “there could be no such thing as love without health”. “Love”, he added, as if health had not been a sure thing for him to date, “needs time and health”.
Alas, for poor Keats, a cure was not found, despite the offices of famed English doctor and Roman resident James Clark, who nonetheless encouraged Keats to get out and about, to be in the world.
Guinean woman Aisha, a young mother of three, insisted, that “travelling meant learning, learning meant travelling, no matter what”. She had limited patience with Ali's despair about Italian job markets visibly affected by racism. She felt that Keats had done the right thing. “You must never stop travelling, never stop learning,” she re-asserted, like an oft-visited line of poetry. “That is the life”.

Her English and her Italian were already excellent. Another new arrival to Italian shores, Virgil's character Aeneas, expresses a similar attitudinal mantra in the heroic dactylic hexameter of the epic:
What greater ills hereafter can you bear?
Resume your courage and dismiss your care,
An hour will come, with pleasure to relate
Your sorrows past, as benefits of Fate.
Thro' various hazards and events, we move
To Latium and the realms foredoom'd by Jove.
Keats, though suffering a terminal illness, was generally given to more melancholy views. In the poem, Ode to a Nightingale, one of his five great odes from 1819, he tackles themes of mortality:
Fade far away, dissolve, and quite forget
What thou among the leaves hast never known,
The weariness, the fever, and the fret
But a few stanzas on, Keats has some quite contemporary things to say about settler dislocation and homesickness:
Thou was not born for death, immortal Bird!
No hungry generations tread thee down;
The voice I hear this passing night was heard
In ancient days by emperor and clown:
Perhaps the self-same song that found a path
Through the sad heart of Ruth, when, sick for home,
She stood in tears amid the alien corn
The same that oft-times hath
Charm'd magic casements, opening on the foam
Of perilous seas, in faery lands forlorn.
The story of Keats's life and death hit a nerve for some now “amid the alien corn”. Hakim had made a perilous passage across the sea to reprise Keats's epitaph (“Here lies one whose life was writ in water”). But as the workshop came to a close, he was laughing, full of life, bemused by the recent gift to the museum of Mary Shelley's portable writing desk, a small, sloped timber escritoire with a suitcase-like handle.
This object, with its lockable desktop, KSH curator Giuseppe Albano proudly observed, was the laptop of its day.
“I am just like Keats,” the young man said. “But I am staying longer,” he added, with a lopsided grin.
“Yeah? You got a girl yet?” Mohammad piped up. “Yo! A bright star?”
The names of refugee workshop participants have been changed.

					07:30 CEST+02:00				",Paul O'Mahony,Swedes rescue Syrian refugee's cat in Sicily,"A Syrian refugee will be granted her wish this Easter after staff at a Swedish animal shelter rescued her long lost cat from quarantine in Sicily.
The animal shelter in Grängesberg, central Sweden, raised funds through its Facebook page to bring Mela to Sweden after receiving a message from a concerned Swedish villager to say how much the Syrian asylum seeker was missing her pet.
The woman had brought the cat with her when she fled Syria but customs officials in Sicily impounded Mela and the woman had to travel on without her.
“The money started coming in very quickly. We had to add a little bit of our own money too but we quickly got almost enough to make it happen,” Minna Lind at the Hopp för Hemlösa (Hope for Homeless) shelter told The Local.
The Syrian woman, who is in her thirties, managed to escape the war in the Middle Eastern country and boarded a boat to Sicily with her two brothers. The older of the two brothers died during the notoriously perilous journey and the woman now lives at a home for asylum seekers in Värnäs, 400 kilometres north-west of Stockholm, with her surviving brother.
Once the shelter had cobbled the money together, Minna Lind’s daughter, who lives in Milan, flew to Sicily and took Mela out of her six-month quarantine.
The cat — registered in her passport as an Angora, though Minna Lind’s not sure that's right — then spent two months in a Milan veterinary clinic.
Minna’s daughter Madeleine visited the clinic several times a week to check on the cat.
“Mela is deaf but that doesn’t matter, it’s still good to talk to her,” said Minna Lind.
On Saturday Madeleine flew with the cat from Milan to Arlanda airport in Stockholm, and now Mela is waiting to be reunited with her owner on Good Friday at Minna’s shelter.
“I have heard that the woman is very, very happy and grateful about this. The only wish she had in her life was to see Mela again.""
Minna Lind noted however that more help was needed, since asylum seekers in Sweden get only a small daily allowance to cover their most basic needs.
“That’s not going to be enough to look after a cat, so now we are going to try to collect some more money for her. We are giving her a climbing box and toys from the shelter but obviously she will need more than that,” said Minna Lind.
""But first I am just really looking forward to meeting everyone when they come to pick Mela up on Friday.”
Sweden takes in more asylum seekers per capita than any other European country and requests are rising to record levels, with about 90,000 applications anticipated by the end of 2015.
Numbers have been steadily rising since Sweden became the first European country in 2013 to grant automatic residency to Syrian refugees, but it has also accepted thousands of others from nations including Eritrea, Iraq, Afghanistan and the Balkans as well as a growing influx from Somalia."

					12:24 CET+01:00				", The Local,Amnesty slams Switzerland's 'illegal' treatment of migrants at Italian border,"Amnesty International has criticized the actions of Switzerland in turning back migrants at the Italian border last year, saying it acted “illegally”.
In a press release accompanying its annual report 2016/17, published on Wednesday, Amnesty said the Swiss authorities “had illegally turned back several thousand asylum seekers to Italy”.
Among them were “several hundred unaccompanied minors, many of them who had relatives in Switzerland,” it said.
Switzerland's border guards hit the headlines last summer when reports emerged that migrants trying to get into the country at the border with Italy in the canton of Ticino were being turned back.
Italy complained that Switzerland's actions were causing hundreds of migrants to become stranded in the Italian city of Como, with makeshift camps springing up around the train station.
At the time the president of an Italian refugee organization said Switzerland had suspended an agreement with Italy allowing some migrants to cross into Italy.
But a spokesman for the Swiss border agency told The Local that no such agreement existed and that Switzerland was simpling following the rules.
Under Swiss law, any migrant who wishes to seek asylum in Switzerland must present themselves at the border and request asylum. They will then be registered with the relevant authorities and taken into the Swiss asylum system.
However many migrants do not wish to claim asylum in Switzerland but simply pass through the country in order to reach another, such as Germany, and claim asylum there.
In that case, the Swiss authorities do not consider them to have refugee status and therefore they are sent back to the country they arrived from.
However in a statement obtained by news agency ATS, Denise Graf, asylum coordinator of the Swiss section of Amnesty, said the methods used by Swiss border guards “prevented or dissuaded people from entering the country”.
Migrants, including minors, told Amnesty they had tried to lodge an asylum request on numerous occasions but did not succeed.
In refusing people asylum, “the border guards violate Swiss law,” said Amnesty.
Border guards also failed to properly assess people's circumstances before sending them back to Italy, particularly where children were concerned, while a lack of interpreters fuelled confusion at the border, according to the human rights body.
No one interviewed by Amnesty in Como had received information from the Swiss authorities about the correct procedure to follow, it added.
Contacted by The Local, David Marquis, a spokesman for the Swiss Border Agency, said they “vehemently reject this criticism from Amnesty International” and that they had complied with all applicable laws.
Those who seek asylum or protection in accordance with the law are passed to reception centres run by the Swiss migration office (SEM), it said.
However migrants who merely want to pass through the country and who do not fulfil conditions of entry under Article 5 of the Foreigners Act are extradited to Italy under the terms of a readmission agreement dating from 2000.
The agency is “in constant contact with various relief organizations” in order to “optimize” its processes, added Marquis.
Amnesty's annual report also criticized Switzerland for other actions last year, including restrictions on the movements of asylum seekers in reception centres, and the use of disproportionate force by police in certain cantons during operations to expel migrants.
Concerns remain over attempts to deport asylum seekers suffering from mental illness, said the report, mentioning the attempted deportation of a Kurd who had previously tried to commit suicide.
The report also picked up on the case of a 19-year-old dual national who intended to join Isis, saying the SEM wanted to strip him of his Swiss nationality even though he hadn't yet been convicted of any crime.
However Amnesty did have some good things to say, praising the “positive measures” that came out of the new law on asylum, passed in a referendum in June 2016.
It also noted a new law requiring cantons to ensure that young asylum seekers had access to education, and the lower house of Parliament's vote in favour of giving gay people to right to adopt their partner's children."

					16:54 CEST+02:00				",AFP,EU and Turkey 'agree plan to ease refugee flow',"The European Union and Turkey have agreed in principle to a plan of action to help ease the flow of migrants into the bloc, a German newspaper reported on Sunday.
The Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung said the European Commission and Turkish government representatives struck the accord last week and that it would be approved during talks Monday in Brussels between Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and EU leaders.
Under the plan, Turkey would agree to stepped-up efforts to secure its frontier with the EU by taking part in joint patrols with the Greek coastguard in the eastern Aegean coordinated by EU border protection agency Frontex, the report said.
Any migrants picked up would be taken back to Turkey, where six new camps for up to two million people would be built, co-financed by the EU.
EU states meanwhile would agree to take in up to 500,000 people to ensure their safe passage across the sea without the involvement of people smugglers.
The report, citing Commission and German sources, said the plan fleshed out a preliminary 2013 agreement between Brussels and Ankara.
Assuming there is an accord Monday, the plan would go before EU leaders at the next summit in mid-October.
The EU has long called on Turkey to do more to stem the tide of migrants making the dangerous crossing to Greece, with more than 500,000 having made it to Europe's shores this year.
EU leaders agreed at an emergency migrant summit last week to offer more aid to Ankara as well as other countries in the region.
But the EU believes Ankara could do more to tackle what it says are some 30,000 people smugglers in Turkey.
It also wants to set up ""hotspots"" for registering asylum seekers on Turkish soil -- a measure recently ruled out by Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu.
Turkey is currently hosting almost two million Syrian refugees."

					10:44 CEST+02:00				",Catherine Edwards,Milan Airbnb hosts to take in refugees in pilot project,"Accommodation rental site Airbnb on Wednesday launched a project in Milan allowing residents to offer their spare rooms or apartments to refugees.
The Open Homes Refugees initiative, set up in collaboration with Refugees Welcome Italy and Catholic organization the Community of Sant'Egidio, allows Milan locals to open their doors to migrants and refugees.
Since its launch on Wednesday morning, the company has already received 100 offers of housing, according to Federica Calcaterra, the communications manager for Airbnb Italia.
Those wishing to take part in the project need to create a profile on the site, which includes identity and security checks, but people who haven't previously hosted guests through the platform are also able to sign up. The charity organizations then book rooms on behalf of the people they are assisting.

The project was inspired by the Open Homes Project, sponsored by Milan city authorities in 2016, which saw 126 residents sign up to host family members of patients in Milan hospitals.
Milan has been chosen as the pilot city for the project's Italy launch, soon to be followed by Rome and other locations across the capital.
The Lombard capital has seen particularly high numbers of migrant arrivals since 2015, both as a result of being relocated from reception centres across the country, and after being turned back from the borders with Switzerland, France and Austria in summer 2016.
Local charities mobilized to accommodate the newcomers, but in August last year, city authorities said there were more people than beds as migrant numbers reached an all-time high, a problem which continued into autumn and winter.
Milan's city councillor for social policy, Pierfrancesco Majorino, on Wednesday praised ""the ability of the Milanese to respond to new appeals, as happened a year and a half ago with our host family project"", saying it was ""not an accident"" the city had been chosen for the Open Homes Refugees project.
Airbnb first began offering accommodation free of charge to those in need following Hurricane Sandy in 2012, when one user requested that the site make this capacity available.
The company reacted by creating a service called Disaster Response, allowing users to provide free accommodation to those affected by events such as floods and fires, currently including the Grenfell Tower block fire in London and the wildfires across parts of Portugal.
""Every single time we've asked our community to open their doors and hearts to help others, they have more than exceeded our expectations: they have humbled us with the immensity of their kindness,"" said Joe Gebbia, the site's co-founder.

In need of emergency treatment, the pregnant woman was taken to the nearby Crown Princess cruise ship to be seen by the doctors on-board. She was then airlifted to the Sicilian city of Catania where she gave birth to a baby girl, Italian authorities said. The boat carrying 44 children, 20 women and 94 men was spotted last night around 100 miles off the coast of Sicily. A naval plane then guided the boat and the Italian coast guard helped transfer the refugees to two naval ships and onward to the port of Syracuse. A video of the rescue shows members of the Italian coastguard helping the refugees, including a number of young children, off the rickety boat. The coast guard then pilots a rescue boat to the cruise ship, where doctors rush to the aid of the pregnant woman. The video shows the Syrian woman being put on a stretcher and carried to the cruise ship by ten crew, while the other refugees are given food.
The rescue marks the latest in a wave of boat migrants to Italy. On Friday the UN refugee agency said that 3,300 Syrians have arrived in Italy by boat in recent weeks, fleeing a civil war which has raged for more than two years. Watch the video of the rescue:"

Moussa, a 37-year-old from Mali, waits at Brenner station everyday in the hope that the kindly guard will finally let him board a train to Munich.
He arrived in southern Italy by boat via Libya eight months ago, before making his way to the northern border with Austria in the hope of eventually being able to join his brother in Germany.
Clutching his only form of identification - a piece of paper proving he has a permit to stay in Italy - he said he sometimes spends the night on the station floor.
“My brother managed to get from here to Germany about five months ago,” he told The Local, just after being prevented from getting on the Munich train, which passes through Austria, on Friday afternoon.
""He keeps telling me to go to Germany. It's better for work there,"" added Moussa, a mechanic by trade. ""I can stay here, but it's impossible to work.""
His brother's unhindered journey came before Italy was forced to send extra guards to reinforce patrols at the Alpine Brenner Pass crossing point after Austria threatened to step-up anti-migrant controls.

Austria, which last year accepted 90,000 asylum requests, hinted at building a 375-metre long fence unless Italy stemmed the flow of migrants. The threats to raise the boundaries sparked protests from pro-migrant activists.

Fearing the impact on trade – the historic Brenner Pass is a crucial lifeline for exports to northern Europe – Italy was swift to react, eventually leading Austria to back down on its threats on Friday.
“He has no passport, if I let him cross into Austria he'd immediately be sent back,” the train guard told The Local.
“He has a permit to stay in Italy, I can't let him pass.”
The guard added that while other migrants still came to the station each day, the number had dropped significantly in recent weeks.
Until last summer, the mountainous South Tyrol, Italy's richest region, was relatively untouched by the migrant crisis.
Before then, most would make their way up to Ventimiglia, in the hope of crossing over to France. That was until French authorities effectively ‘closed' the border, forcibly removing people from trains and carrying out stringent checks of cars and even mountain paths.
Exacerbated by its own influx, Austria has also sent hundreds back to Italy.
A centre, capable of hosting 70 migrants, was set up in Brenner last year as it became a prominent transit hub.
“The centre assisted 17,000 people over the course of the year,” the mayor of Brenner, Franz Kompatscher, told The Local.
But few of those people stayed in the town, he added, admitting he had “no idea” where the rest end up.
“Some wait in Brenner, but for the most part, they don't stay.”
Under a government plan, South Tyrol, which has a population of 511,000, must take in 0.9 percent of the total number of migrants who seek asylum in Italy.
As the measure got underway last year, migrant centres were hurriedly built across the region, with the majority being housed in the city of Bolzano. Apart from Brenner, other centres, managed by the charity, Caritas, have sprung up in Vipiteno, Malles, Tesimo, Vandoies, Val di Vizze and Brunico.
But the arrivals have created social challenges, with some 240 asylum seekers sleeping rough on the streets of Bolzano, according to recent reports in the local press.
Meanwhile, migrant arrivals have sparked “a war among the poor” in Vipiteno, local businessman Roberto Giordani told The Local.
“Until a couple of years ago, there was no Caritas here,” he said.
“Now around 300 families in Vipiteno depend on it. But there is resentment over the €35 a day that goes to each migrant.”
The patience of locals, especially in Bolzano, has also been put to the test. In late December, the prestigious Museion Bozen-Bolzano turned off its free wifi because the service was attracting too many migrants.
And although few are in Brenner, residents there are worried that the summer could bring more than the area can handle.
Italy last week eclipsed Greece in terms of migrant arrivals for the first time since June 2015, with 8,370 landing in April alone.
“People are generally open in this region – but only up to a certain point,” Kompatscher said."

refugee crisis.
The 58-year-old diplomat will replace Antonio Guterres, of Portugal, who was UN High Commissioner for Refugees since 2005, a UN statement said.
Grandi, who will take up the job on January 1st, beat out former Danish prime minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt and German Achim Steiner, the director of the UN Environment Program, for the key appointment.
Thorning-Schmidt, who became an Internet sensation after snapping a selfie with President Barack Obama, had lobbied for the job since stepping down in June.
The choice of Grandi was seen as a nod to Italy, which has been hard-hit by the refugee crisis in Europe, but also as recognition of Grandi's work in several tough UN positions.
Among those was his challenging work as head of the UN Palestinian refugee agency UNRWA from 2010 to 2014, a post he held after serving as its number two from 2005 to 2010.
Denmark's restrictive policies on refugees were cited as weighing against Thorning-Schmidt.
There were also concerns about representation given that a Danish national, Michael Moller, heads the UN office in Geneva.
Before taking over the top posts at UNRWA, Grandi worked as deputy envoy to the UN aid mission in Afghanistan and was UNHCR's chief of mission there.
Throughout his 25-year career at the UN, he was involved in UNHCR efforts in Sudan, Syria, Turkey and Iraq, and led humanitarian operations in Yemen and the Democratic Republic of Congo, among other countries.
The appointment is expected to be endorsed next week by the UN General Assembly, a move widely seen as a formality.
Guterres is due to step down at the end of the year after overseeing efforts to help 60 million people worldwide who have been driven from their homes by wars and persecution.
UNHCR has said that number marks an all-time high, surpassing the 50 million people who were displaced during the Second World War."

On Thursday afternoon, coastguard chief Felicio Angrisano said in a statement that 94 people had died, with rescue divers later saying they had identified at least 40 more bodies in and around the sunken wreck at a depth of around 40 metres (130 feet), just a few hundred metres from the shore. There were fears on Thursday night that the final toll could rise further to 300 or more people since rescuers said that only around 150 survivors had been plucked from the water over 12 hours after the disaster. ""We are doing our utmost effort to rescue from the sea as many lives as possible. Today more than 150 people have been saved, otherwise they would have drowned,"" Admiral Felicio Angrisano said in the statement on Thursday afternoon. ""Every day, thousands of men and women desperately try to escape war-torn countries and misery, travelling on crumbling boats, which are old and overcrowded,"" he added. ""These boats are destined to sink. The rough sea and approach of winter increases the risk."" Angrisano said that the already dire situation is likely to get worse, a situation which ""cannot fail to mark the conscience of everyone"". ""For the many victims of these days, also on behalf of all my men engaged in relief efforts, I express my deepest sympathy. "" Rescuers and local fishermen were overcome with emotion as they spoke of chaotic early morning scenes in the water, with ""a sea of heads"" as desperate refugees waved their arms and screamed. There were also poignant stories of survival like the young Eritrean woman thought dead and laid out with other corpses before medical personnel realised she was still breathing and revived her. ""Seeing the bodies of the children was a tragedy. We have run out of coffins,"" said Pietro Bartolo, a doctor. ""In many years of work here, I have never seen anything like this,"" he said. Lampedusa is one of the main entry points into the European Union for asylum-seekers crossing from north Africa or the eastern Mediterranean. Migreurop, a network of immigration charities, estimates some 17,000 migrants have died at sea trying to reach Europe in the past 20 years, crossing on rickety fishing boats or dinghies. Survivors said they were from Eritrea and Somalia and had left from the Libyan port of Misrata. The migrants told rescuers they set fire to a blanket on the boat to attract the attention of coast guards after their vessel began taking on water and passing fishing boats ignored them.
The fire spread quickly, sowing panic on board which caused the boat to flip over and sink, as people jumped into the sea to save themselves. Raffaele Colapinto, a local fisherman who was one the first on the scene, said: ""We saw a sea of heads. We took as many as we could on board."" Visibly shaken survivors in thermal blankets -- many of them bare-chested -- were seen on the dock and being treated at the hospital where personnel said many had swallowed gasoline and sea water. 'A European tragedy' The bodies were being taken to a hangar at the local airport because there was no more room in the morgue on the remote island, which has a population of around 6,000 people. Italian Prime Minister Enrico Letta called the incident ""an immense tragedy"" and the government declared a national day of mourning on Friday and a minute of silence to be held in all schools. Deputy Prime Minister Angelino Alfano called for more assistance from the European Union to deal with the sharp increase in refugee arrivals, calling it ""a European tragedy"". Some 25,000 people have landed on Italian shores so far this year -- more than three times the number for the whole of 2012, although the figure for 2011 at the height of the Arab Spring revolts in north Africa was higher at around 50,000. In the last major disaster in June 2011, between 200 and 270 immigrants fleeing Libya are believed to have died off the coast of Tunisia. Many of the arrivals have been on Lampedusa, which is closer to Tunisia than to Sicily. Most of them have been Eritreans, Somalis and Syrians. ""We no longer have any space for the living or the dead,"" local mayor Giusi Nicolini said, explaining the cemetery and the refugee centre were full. Letta ""should come here and count the bodies"", said the mayor, who often accuses the national government of failing to help the island. The EU's Home Affairs Commissioner Cecilia Malmstroem called on EU countries to do more to take in refugees, which she said would help reduce the number of perilous Mediterranean crossings. Pope Francis, who visited Lampedusa in July to plead for more attention to the plight of refugees, called the disaster ""shameful"" and called for action to prevent more deaths."

					16:44 CEST+02:00				",AFP,Italy struggles to help traumatized refugees,"The sensation of drowning, short-term memory loss, insomnia and suicidal tendencies: they may have made it safely to Italy, but many asylum seekers are plagued by symptoms of trauma and the psychological help they need is in short supply.
Between ten percent and 30 percent of asylum seekers reaching Europe are estimated to have been tortured in their home countries. All are at risk of trauma during desert crossings, a lawless Libya, or treacherous boat journeys.
Italy's Doctors for Human Rights association (Medu) noted in a recent report that over half of some 100 asylum seekers interviewed in Sicily had seen a travelling companion or close relative die during the Mediterranean crossing.
One man, who lost both his wife and child when the boat he was travelling on sank, was so distressed at having to relate the experience to an asylum commissioner, that he threw himself out of a window.
A fellow survivor, a 26-year old from Sub-Saharan Africa, spent so many hours desperately trying to keep his head above water as he clung to a bit of driftwood that he is now plagued by sensations of drowning at night, leading to insomnia and anxiety issues.
New arrivals are often confined for months in crowded centres while refugee applications are slowly processed.
Traumas can go undetected or have a detrimental effect on requests for asylum, according to psychologist Massimo Germani, who directed a centre for torture victims in Rome.
Germani said victims often narrate facts but not emotions, listing atrocities in such a neutral tone of voice that those examining their status doubt they are refugees ""when it is actually a sign of a very serious problem"".
'System worsens mental heath'
A study carried out in 2013 by the Italian Refugee Council (CIR) found that 38 percent of asylum seekers in Italy suffered from depression, while 44 percent were battling with complex post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
Welcome centres are expected to provide psychological assistance as part of services financed by the state, but the interior ministry is unable to supply figures on how many migrants and refugees actually have access to care.
In theory, asylum seekers can use the public health system, though there are limited facilities tailored specifically for migrants and refugees, and the International Organization for Migration (IOM) said here too numbers were unclear.
Palermo psychologist Maria Chiara Monti works for one of the few clinics which organizes sessions twice a week, where both an anthropologist and a cultural mediator who speaks the patient's language are present.
""They are often vulnerable people or trauma victims, and the system - the long, bureaucratic process of asylum - worsens their mental health,"" she told AFP, describing testimonies ""from far away lands, which leave deep marks"".
""Sometimes therapy has to be interrupted because patients are moved, often without warning, to another centre. But we do the best we can with the time we have,"" she said.
There are other challenges too: one 30-year-old from Gambia is so traumatized by an episode of police torture in his home country that his short-term memory is affected, meaning each session has to begin more or less from scratch.
From camps housing thousands of people to small converted hotels, ""the implementation of psychological assistance is very patchy,"" said Gennaro Migliore, head of a parliamentary investigation into Italy's reception system.
""The health system needs to be computerized to allow care to be monitored from the arrival of asylum seekers until they obtain their refugee status,"" he said.
""There are sometimes some very good services, particularly in the centres for unaccompanied minors. But often, the health priority is elsewhere, in the fight against infections for example,"" he added.
'Enormous damage'
Fiorella Rathaus, who coordinates projects to support torture victims for the Italian Refugee Council, said that in numerous centres in fact, ""often psychological assistance is not provided at all, or just for a few hours a week, and in general it's given by a young graduate little equipped to deal with such traumas"".
Psychologist Germani said some PTSD symptoms can be eased by giving sufferers access to decent living conditions, opportunities to enjoy themselves and prospects for the future - no easy task in a country struggling to deal with mass arrivals.
Others suffer from much graver traumas which need to be identified and addressed as soon as possible. ""We're talking about people who have suffered repeated abuse, over a long time and in a coercive context,"" he said.
""If they remain in the melee with the others, they cannot keep up. They cannot concentrate enough to learn Italian, they are unstable and their condition deteriorates with their isolation.
""That causes enormous damage, on both a human and social level, because they become a burden on the system, they turn into ghosts who congest social services for years,"" he said.
Younger victims have been known to turn to prostitution, while unchecked trauma in those affected can boil over into violence.
The interior ministry set up a round table in November to draw up guidelines for welcome centres on psychological care, but in the meantime sufferers continue to fall through the gaps, while funding cuts have forced some public services - including Germani's - to shut their doors."

Francis's call for every Catholic parish in Europe to take in a refugee family
to help ease the continent's unprecedented migrant crisis.
Francis, giving the Angelus blessing in Saint Peter's Square on Sunday, urged ""every parish, every religious community, every monastery, every sanctuary in Europe"" to take in migrants in need.
Some see the proposal as over-ambitious but many groups called it a useful blueprint that draws on the formidable organising skills of the Catholic Church.
""There are tens of thousands of parishes in Europe,"" said Father Peter Balleis, international director of the Jesuit Refugee Service (JRS).
""And in each one, hundreds of families are able to organize and take turns welcoming refugees.""
According to the UN refugee agency, it takes about six to eight months to process an asylum application in Europe, sometimes longer if legal issues arise. During this time, many refugees are in desperate need of a place to stay.
Increasing efforts
The JRS has already been working with refugees looking for a temporary home, and plans to expand its efforts.
Five years ago the group launched a programme in the Paris area called ""Welcome"", under which around a hundred families and religious communities house refugee families for five weeks.
The programme has been successful in helping migrants integrate and is now being rolled out to several other French cities, as well as to other countries, such as Spain.
JRS says the five-week time limit is to encourage the refugees to be independent - without leaving any of the refugees on the street.
""After a while, you need the person to enter into the society"" of the host country, said Jean-Marie Carriere, regional director of the JRS.
Other European communities have also already welcomed thousands of asylum seekers and are preparing for more.
Cardinal Angelo Bagnasco, chairman of the Italian bishops' conference, told the country's La Repubblica daily there was evidence ""of an important movement in all dioceses"".
Italy's Catholic organizations have already taken in between 15,000 and 20,000 asylum seekers.
In Austria too, dioceses have offered thousands of places for migrants to stay and several have announced plans to do more.
Pannonhalma Abbey in northwest Hungary, which is run by the Benedictine Order, has also opened its doors to Syrian families trekking across the country to western Europe, and said it is prepared to repeat the experience.
Carlotta Sami, spokesperson in Italy for the UN refugee agency, said that the pope's calls to action supported the agency's goals.
""The pope's voice has helped us for years to strongly support the welcome of those fleeing war and violence,"" she said.
Opportunity for interreligious dialogue
One detail the pope didn't mention in his appeal is that the majority of the 336,000 migrants who arrived this year on Europe's shores are Muslim.
Father Balleis saw it as a chance for foreign and local families to ""get to know and understand"" one another.
The Catholic Church isn't the only church appealing for greater solidarity.
The archbishop of the Finnish Lutheran Church, Kari Mäkinen, called Saturday for the country's parishes to open up their centres for retreats and summer activities to refugees.
There has also been an outpouring of solidarity from groups with no religious affiliation, in Germany and elsewhere.
In France, the Singa foundation said it had received more than 1,000 offers of accommodation in just a few days, and in the UK more than 2,000 residents have said they are ready to welcome refugees as well."

As the search continued for hundreds of missing refugees on Friday, experts said more must be done to prevent another tragedy. Emergency services on the remote island - Italy's southernmost point - said they had recovered 111 bodies so far and rescued 155 survivors from a boat with an estimated 450 to 500 people on board. Divers were unable to descend to the wreck on Friday because of choppy conditions but coast guard vessels scoured the surface for more corpses. UN High Commissioner for Refugees Antonio Guterres commended the swift action taken by the Italian Coast Guard to save lives while expressing great concern about the growing number of refugees. ""He expressed his dismay at a rising global phenomenon of migrants and people fleeing conflict or persecution and perishing at sea,"" the UNHCR said in a statement. The boat, which originated from Libya, caught fire half a mile from the coast and a Tunisian survivor, allegedly a people smuggler, was apprehended as prosecutors launched a multiple murder investigation. The European Union pledged to help Italy to deal with the wave of migrants while the UNHCR said it was actively engaging with countries in the region in a bid to find alternatives for those who risked their lives on such dangerous journeys across the Mediterranean. Thursday's incident was the second boat disaster this week off the Italian coast. Thirteen men drowned off the southern coast of Italy on Monday when they attempted to swim ashore when their boat ran aground. A growing number of Syrian refugees have been among those seeking to reach the Italian coastline in recent months. James Stapleton, from the Jesuit Refugee Service, said the European Union’s border agency Frontex needed to be beefed up with more boats to ensure that asylum seekers did not lose their lives as they crossed the Mediterranean. “We need more boats in the sea,” Stapleton told Vatican Radio. “I think the reason why people continue to take these risks is that Europe has made it more difficult. In 1992 we had twice as many asylum applications in Europe as we do today. “We are forcing people to take increasingly dangerous routes and what we need to do is to intervene and put human lives first."" Save the Children’s Italian branch said the latest incident should serve as “a warning for all of us”. “Once again, hundreds of people, among them several children, lost their lives on the umpteenth voyage towards a better life,” said Raffaela Milano, head of Italian programmes for Save the Children. Save the Children estimates nearly 22,000 migrants have arrived on the coasts of Sicily, Calabria and Puglia during 2013 – and 4,000 of them were children, many unaccompanied.
Milano said Italy and Europe should not remain indifferent to the constant flow of young foreigners who were often unaccompanied and stressed the survivors of the latest disaster would need urgent assistance to deal with the trauma. Save the Children has staff in Lampedusa and other locations in Sicily, Puglia and Calabria including cultural and legal experts who work with UNHCR, the International Red Cross and the Italian interior ministry. Flags flew at half mast across Italy on Friday and schools held a minute of silence for the victims."

Soon after arriving at Larnaca airport on Tuesday evening the four were taken to a reception centre near the southern coastal town of Kofinou.
The first group of six asylum-seekers - from Syria, Iraq and Eritrea - were relocated from Greece in February.
The transfers are part of the EU relocation programme agreed by the European Union institutions and a number of member states in September 2015.
Under the scheme, Cyprus pledged to accept the relocation of 440 asylum-seekers from Greece and Italy - the worst hit countries in the migrant crisis.
Cyprus has also agreed to offer resettlement places for 69 vulnerable refugees selected by the UNHCR in countries outside the EU.
The EU responsibility-sharing scheme, which foresees the relocation of 160,000 refugees from Italy and Greece, is seen as an important step towards stabilizing the biggest refugee crisis that Europe has seen in decades.
More than one million people arrived by sea in Europe in 2015. The majority were refugees fleeing persecution and violence in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria.
Authorities say 3,771 people have died or gone missing attempting cross the Mediterranean.

					07:48 CEST+02:00				",AFP,Refugees have brought this dying Italian village back to life,"In the foothills of the Aspromonte mountains in southern Italy, the silence of a once-dying village is broken by the laughter of a small group of refugees.
Tiny Sant'Alessio has been welcoming families and vulnerable migrants here for three years in a project which not only provides humanitarian assistance but brings with it invaluable economic and social benefits.
Over the years the village has dwindled to only 330 inhabitants, many of them elderly. The steep cobbled streets are deserted and most windows are shuttered, residents having left over the years for better work opportunities in Turin, Milan or as far away as Australia.
In an attempt to reverse the trend, however, since 2014 the council has been renting eight of these empty flats to house up to 35 migrants at a time as part of the national SPRAR network (Protection System for Asylum Seekers and Refugees).
Everything is done to help the newcomers get back on their feet, from Italian lessons to legal, medical and psychological assistance, vocational training and social activities such as gardening, cooking and dancing classes.
The village is currently home to an Iraqi Kurdish family, a Gambian couple with a baby and young people from Ghana, Nigeria, Mali and Senegal.
There is a special project for the most vulnerable, including HIV-positive people, diabetics, victims of prostitution networks, a deaf and dumb couple, and a young woman whose toddler son was shot dead in Libya and husband is feared drowned.
'Humane and humanitarian'
""Our mission is both humane and humanitarian, that's the most important thing,"" said Stefano Calabro, a 43-year-old police officer who has been mayor of Sant'Alessio since 2009.
""But there is a significant economic benefit too.""
The state allocates up to 45 euros (47 dollars) a day for each migrant, most of which goes to the organisers to cover costs.
The project has created full or part-time jobs in Sant'Alessio for 16 people including seven locals - from social workers to Italian teachers and cultural mediators.
And it has prevented the closure of the village's basic services - a bar, small supermarket, doctor's surgery and pharmacy.
With funds to spend on services, the council has been able to open a small gym open to all residents and upkeep a lush sports field overlooking the valley, where migrants regularly challenge the team from a nearby drug rehabilitation centre.
After six months to a year here, some of the refugees managed to find work in the region, others headed elsewhere.
Ghanaian Salifu, 23, decided to stay on and has been living off odd jobs like helping with manual work in the fields.
Sant'Alessio may not offer bright lights or much in the way of career opportunities, but a cheerful Salifu says ""we're not going anywhere"".
After months in Sicily's notorious, overcrowded Mineo camp, just small things like quick doctor appointments here seem a luxury.
Vast areas depopulated
Sitting in the sunshine and watching the world go by from his front garden, 89-year old Antonio Sacca - who spent 54 years working in a Turin factory before returning home - says he likes his new neighbours.
""They behave well. They live independent lives but often lend a helping hand,"" he said.
Bar owner and widow Celestina Borrello, 73, whose son left years ago to find work in Belgium, says ""the village was emptying, so if there's a little movement now, it's a good thing"".
""We know what it means to leave our land,"" she adds.
The project has been such a success that Coopisa, the association behind it, is opening others in four villages nearby.
And there is another benefit: those that join the SPRAR network and take in small numbers of refugees are guaranteed not to have to host an emergency reception centre, such as the one in the nearby ski-town of Gambarie, where 120 migrants are massed in a hotel.
With just 26,000 places available, the network is only a small part of Italy's reception system, which hosts more than 176,000 people.
While most are housed in large groups, often angering or frustrating local communities, this dusty village is seen as a quiet triumph.
""Sant'Alessio has been our prototype,"" said Coopisa head Luigi De Filippis, who points out there is scope for the project to go across Italy and beyond.
""There are vast areas affected by the same depopulation in northern Italy and elsewhere in Europe.""

					12:55 CET+01:00				",Patrick Browne,How this tiny Italian town opened its homes to refugees,"A town of 1,500 inhabitants deep in the sun-baked mountains of central Sicily is giving the world a lesson in how to host refugees. Here's why.
Isolated, poor and with an elderly and dwindling population, Sutera might not seem such an attractive proposition for housing migrants. But it is one of many places in Italy in which local residents have thrown open their doors to some of the thousands of refugees who continue to land on the country's beaches.
In countries like Germany and Sweden, looking after refugees has mainly been the job of the state. Italy too has built scores of reception centres to handle the influx. But many Italians have given asylum seekers a much more personal welcome. Sutera's refugee programme is now being held up as proof that integration can work even in the least likely of places.
Mayor Giuseppe Grizzanti decided to open the town's doors to refugees after the tragic Lampedusa shipwreck in October 2013, in which 366 migrants died.
Today, Sutera is home to 34 refugees from the Middle East and Africa, including a number of children, all of whom live with local families.

Grizzanti compares their experience to that of Italians arriving on New York's Ellis Island more than a century ago – some of whom came from Sutera.
“Historically, Sutera – and indeed Sicily – has been an island of emigration,” Grizzanti told The Local.
“But the refugee crisis offered us a change to rejuvenate our town by becoming a centre of immigration.”
Unlike in other Italian towns and cities where migrants are placed in vacant buildings on the edge of town and left to fend for themselves, in Sutera each refugee is entrusted to a local family charged with helping them to integrate.
The policy has three strict rules: no alcohol at home, total respect for privacy and cleanliness and perhaps, most importantly of all, compulsory Italian lessons.
The lessons are organized at Sutera's two schools each week. Adults and children get separate lessons.
Lessons are taught by volunteers like Mario Tona, a retired teacher using his free time and expertise to make sure that refugees get off to the best possible start in Italy.
Sutera is one of many places in Italy - most of them on the poor south - where locals have been conspicuously generous to refugees. In the mining town of Carbonia in Sardinia, locals dipped into their pockets to buy migrants phone cards and cigarettes.
In Satriano in Calabria, the local mayor has renovated derelict homes in the hope of persuading some of the refugees to stay.

But can the migrants eventually help repopulate Sutera?
“Not at all,” says Grizzanti. “I don't think we will be taking any more because we will become stretched. Although we have exported the programme to the neighbouring town Milena – which has just accepted 25.
""The economic reality of life in the town means that most of the refugees will only ever find a short-term home here.""
“It takes around two years for their asylum claims to be processed,” he added.
“After that I expect they will move to a city like Milan or Turin to find work like most of our young people have been forced to do. But this project is not about Sutera – it's a humanitarian project.”
Yet the town is still reaping benefits. Hosting the migrants means a windfall of €260,000 a year – money which has helped boost the local economy. Six local people are employed full-time in running the hospitality project and looking after the refugees' needs.
One such woman is 28-year-old Mariella Cirami.
“I have a new window on the world each day,” she told La Stampa, while underscoring how the project had changed the atmosphere in the city.
“The few children in the town are now playing in the streets with the refugees.”
Last August, the town even celebrated a “festival of hospitality” at which its melting-pot nature was on full display as refugees shared traditional food, music and dances with the rest of village.
But despite the hugely positive nature of the experience so far, Grizzanti admits that many of the residents had strong reservations about the project before it began.
“Initially it unsettled many people especially some of the older residents,” he said. But tensions soon melted away.
In testament to the level of integration reached, Chris Richy, a recent arrival from Nigeria, played a wise man in the town's nativity – a locally famous event that attracts 15,000 visitors each Christmas.
“Here people are good, there's no racism. When I find work as an electrician I want to pay them back for everything they've done,” Richy told La Stampa.
“The only problem here is that it's isolated.”
The nearest city of Caltanisetta is an hour and a half bus ride away, over parched and winding mountain roads lined with fruiting cactus trees.
Before the project, Sutera was famous for being home to a €1.3 million 'white elephant' - a lift to nowhere, that never even opened.
Now it is making news for its exceptional humanitarian efforts during the greatest refugee crisis since the Second World War."

around Rome, the 12 Syrian asylum seekers Pope Francis brought back with him from Lesbos are settling into new lives, their hosts said on Monday.
The three Muslim families are being housed temporarily by the Saint'Egidio religious community in the Rome district of Trastevere while they await longer-term accommodation being prepared for them in the Vatican, community spokesman Maximiliano Signifredi told AFP.
""Yesterday they had their first Italian lessons. They have been going for walks around Trastevere, a new life is opening up in front of them,"" Signifredi said.
""Each of the three families has been assigned a small flat with everything they need while they are awaiting the more spacious apartments the Vatican is getting ready for them.""
In a dramatic gesture designed to highlight the plight of hundreds of thousands of refugees arriving on the southern shores of Europe, Francis on Sunday flew back from Lesbos with the 12 Syrians.
The three couples, who have six children between them, were plucked from a detention camp on the Greek island to start new lives, more than 1,400 miles (nearly 2,300 kilometres) from their homes in Damascus and Deir Ezzor, a city in eastern Syria controlled by the Islamic State group.
Francis said on the plane back from Lesbos that the families had been chosen out of some 3,000 people at the camp simply because their paperwork was sufficiently in order to rapidly conclude an accord on their transfer with the Greek and Italian governments.
""I didn't make a choice between Christians and Muslims. All refugees are children of God,"" Francis told reporters.
The families are expected to seek asylum in Italy rather than through the tiny Vatican city state.
One of the Syrians, a 51-year-old teacher from Deir Ezzor, has said the families, who had planned to try and get to Germany via Greece, do not know what awaits them.
""We don't know whether we will start over in Europe or whether, one day, we will be able to return to a Syria free of war and violence,"" the teacher, identified only as Ramy, told Italian media at the weekend.
The Vatican was already housing two Syrian families in line with Francis's instruction to every Catholic parish in Europe to take in at least one.
The St Egidio community is very active on migration issues and has organized flights to Rome for dozens of Syrian refugees who are housed in the same building as the families brought back by the Pope."

But the plan also calls for fresh efforts to curb the influx, and to expel migrants whose asylum applications are rejected.
""We have to welcome and integrate those who have a right to stay, and send home the others,"" interior minister Marco Minniti told a parliamentary commissions.
Asylum seekers will also be asked to earn their keep by working with little or no pay on civic projects, such as maintaining parks, giving language classes or helping the Red Cross.
The programme has already been tested over the past months in the northern town of Belluno, but in a country where youth unemployment is around 40 percent, many regional councils are bristling at the plan, saying they should be giving jobs to their own citizens.
Labour unions officials have said the project exploits the migrants, a concern echoed by refugee advocates.
For Roberto Zaccaria, president of the Italian Council for Refugees (CIR), volunteer work ""constitutes part of the integration phase, along with Italian classes. But it shouldn't become a condition for obtaining asylum"".
Minniti, however, said ""It's not about creating competition on the job market.""

Spreading the burden
More than 500,000 migrants have entered Italy since 2014, and nearly 175,000 asylum seekers are waiting in reception centres.
The government plans to distribute migrants more evenly across the country, with a goal of 2.5 migrants to every 1,000 residents.
It will provide a total of €100 million ($107 million) to municipalities accepting to increase their share of migrants.
""Not every commune is going to participate right away, but it's a first step,"" said Matteo Biffoni, head of immigration at the National Association of Italian Communes (ANCI).
The government also plans to close the biggest reception centres, ""because smaller numbers allow for a different relation with locals"", Minniti said, adding that he would bolster security at the centres.
Some sites intended to house 300 people currently hold 1,000, and others have been declared unfit for habitation but are still being used, for lack of any alternative, said Gabriella Guido of the advocacy group LasciateCiEntrare (""Let Us In"").
But the new measures will go hand in hand with a new push to deport migrants who fail to qualify for asylum, and stronger border patrols.
Currently, reviews of asylum requests take six months on average, and about 40 percent of the requests are approved.
But for those who fail to qualify, an appeal process can take up to two years.
To speed up the process, a new legal authority will be created for refugees contesting a refusal of asylum.
New holding centres will also be built in each of Italy's 20 regions for refugees facing deportation, compared with three across the country now, with a total capacity of 1,600 people.
Italy will also renew repatriation deals with the migrants' countries of origin, and speed the process for countries with which it already has accords, including Tunisia, Egypt and Nigeria.
Minniti said more expulsions could encourage more voluntary departures, and asked lawmakers to approve doubling the funds earmarked for such cases.
Last week, Italy reached a deal with Libya's UN-backed Government of National Accord to stem the migrant flows and human smuggling, which includes pledges of money, coastguard training and equipment for the North African country.
Of the 181,000 migrants who entered Italy last year, some 90 percent arrived via Libya.
""We are aware that the challenge will be the implementation"" of the accord, Minniti said.
""In Libya, the trafficking of human beings is a powerful criminal and economic force."""

The woman was one of 355 refugees - most of them from Syria - on two boats intercepted by coast guard and navy vessels and escorted to Sicily on Wednesday. ""We found her with a piece of the umbilical cord still attached,"" Luca Sancilio, the local coast guard commander in Syracuse told news channel SkyTG24. Sancilio initially said the woman had given birth to a little girl, although the hospital where they were taken later said the baby was in fact a boy. The coast guard estimated the baby was about four days old and was born during the eight-day voyage. Mother and son are well and resting, the hospital said. A coast guard plane on Tuesday spotted the heavily overcrowded boat that the woman was travelling on. The people on board included 48 children. Mario de Rosa, captain of a navy patrol boat that came to the rescue, told SkyTG24 that the refugee boat suffered engine failure in stormy seas. A second boat with 164 people on board was spotted by a fishing vessel some 15 nautical miles from the coast and was also taken to Syracuse. Several of the refugees were suffering from dehydration, Italian media reported. Another boat carrying 107 Syrian refugees landed in Sicily on Tuesday, getting stuck on rocks just off the shore. Three Egyptian crew members from that boat have been arrested on charges of aiding illegal immigration. Thousands of asylum-seekers have landed in Sicily in recent weeks, many of them coming from Egypt and Syria. ""There are now more Syrians than anyone else. This is a really dramatic exodus,"" Sancilio said. The interior ministry said 2,872 Syrians have landed in Italy so far this year. Also on Wednesday, a boat with 115 migrants presumably arriving from Libya was rescued by the Maltese military and taken to the Mediterranean island state. The boat was intercepted some 90 nautical miles south of Malta, and the crew said they were in distress as their dinghy had started taking on water. This was the second group to arrive on Malta this week after the navy on Tuesday rescued another group of 81 migrants, most of them apparently from Eritrea."

The 49-year-old woman was saved along with her husband and two teenage sons by the Italian coastguard off the coast of Siracusa in Sicily on August 28th. The family had reportedly fled from Damascus and were planning to travel to Sweden from Italy. The woman was transferred to the Umberto I in Siracusa but doctors were unable to save her. Her husband then gave his consent for the woman’s organs to be donated to Italy. Thanks to his decision, three life-saving operations have now been carried out: one liver transplant on a 66-year-old Sicilian man, one kidney transplant on a 60-year-old Calabrian woman and another kidney transplant on a 41-year-old man also from Sicily. 'Touching experience' “It was a very touching experience that shows what real solidarity is,” Maurillo Carpinteri, a doctor who treated the woman told La Repubblica, “The father and two teenage boys overcame all mistrust and trusted completely. In a moment of great desperation they gave all that they had with a dignity that is truly exemplary.” Health minister Beatrice Lorenzin offered her “profound thanks” to the family, describing the incident as “an example of how even in dramatic situations of great need, when refugees arrive on our coasts, there are people who manage to make loving gestures towards their neighbour that silently benefit from others.” According to the paper, the woman worked as a nurse in Syria and her husband was a businessman. The family said they intended to travel to Sweden where the woman’s eldest son works. The woman’s body will now be buried in Malta where her mother and two brothers live.
This family story is just one of the many tragedies which have dominated Italian headlines in the past month. On Monday AFP reported that a 52-year-old Palestinian woman who was a resident in Syria died while crossing to Italy with her two sons and her husband, who suffered a leg injury. Last week, a Syrian refugee was even forced to give birth at sea on her way to Italy. AFP reports that thousands of migrants arriving on Italian shores in the past few weeks are Syrian and Egyptian refugees, many of them children and some as young as three. On Monday Italy's Prime Minister Enrico Letta warned that the European Union lacks an adequate approach for the refugee problem that will worsen in the case of an international intervention in Syria."

Dozens of people have been blocked at the Sicilian port of Catania on the Diciotti vessel since Monday night because the Italian government is refusing to allow them to disembark without commitments from the EU to take some of them in.
Italy on Friday said it would pull its funding for the EU as a ""compensatory measure"" if the bloc refused to come forward and help with relocating the migrants.
The UNHCR on Saturday said EU member states should ""urgently"" offer places to some of the migrants on the vessel, adding: ""In the meantime, UNHCR urges Italian authorities to allow the immediate disembarkation of those on board"".
A high-level meeting of a dozen EU member states in Brussels on Friday, held to discuss what officials said was the broader issue of the disembarkation of migrants rescued at sea, failed to produce an immediate
solution for the Diciotti migrants.

""The European Union has decided to turn its back on Italy once again,"" Deputy Prime Minister Luigi Di Maio wrote on his Facebook page, adding that his country had no choice but to ""take a compensatory measure in a unilateral way... we are ready to reduce the funds that we give to the European Union"".
""They want the 20 billion euros ($23 billion) paid by Italian citizens? Then let them demonstrate that they deserve it and that they are taking charge of a problem that we can no longer face alone. The borders of Italy are the borders of Europe,"" he added.
Migration is a hot-button issue in Italy, where hundreds of thousands of people have arrived since 2013 fleeing war, persecution and poverty in the Middle East, Africa and Asia.
Under EU rules people must seek asylum in their country of arrival, but Italy's new government has increasingly barred boats from docking at its ports.
'Unconstructive comments'
Brussels quickly hit back at Di Maio's comments.
""Unconstructive comments, let alone threats, are not helpful and they will not get us any closer to a solution,"" European Commission spokesman Alexander Winterstein told a briefing.
""The EU is a community of rules and it operates on the basis of rules, not threats.""
No deal was struck about the Diciotti migrants at the talks, as a source at the European Commission said ""this was not a meeting where decisions were taken"".
However, the source said they discussed ""the need for a shared and rapid solution for the migrants on board of the Diciotti as well as those most recently disembarked in Spain and Malta.""
EU figures for 2016 say Italy contributed just under 14 billion euros to the EU budget -- less than one percent of its gross national income -- while the bloc spent 11.6 billion euros in Italy.
Di Maio, who heads the anti-establishment Five Star, said Italy didn't want the ""mickey taken out of us by the union's other countries"" on the distribution of migrants.
""The EU was born of principles like solidarity. If it is not capable of redistributing 170 people it has serious problems with its founding principles,"" he said in an interview with state broadcaster RAI.
Prosecutors from Sicily were travelling to Rome to question officials, including Italy's hardline Interior Minister Matteo Salvini, about the illegal detention of those onboard.
""If a judge wants to arrest me, I expect it, no problem,"" Salvini said Friday.
'We've had enough'
Salvini stopped the majority of the migrants disembarking from the ship after they were rescued on August 15. His only concession was to allow 27 unaccompanied minors off the boat on Wednesday.

Opinion polls suggest that Salvini's stance has boosted his far-right League party's approval rating to around 30 percent -- a more than 10 point jump from its showing in March's election -- and is now level with the Five Star Movement with which it has governed Italy since early June.
However, according to Salvini's own ministry, migrant arrivals are more than 80 percent down on the same period last year, with just over 19,500 arriving up to August 23, compared to 98,000 in 2017.
In France, meanwhile, the presidency called for a ""co-ordinated, long-term European mechanism"" to distribute migrants that would include Italy. ""There are forces in Italy that are looking to co-operate, we want to believe Italy wishes to play the game,"" the Elysee palace said."

Their lawyer Anton Giulio Lana said the government now recognised Shalabayeva's ""founded fear of persecution."" The family had lived in Rome before the deportation. A former Kazakh energy and trade minister, Ablyazov is accused of having stolen billions of dollars in state and investor funds while leading the Kazakh BTA Bank, which also had interests in Russia and Ukraine. Ablyazov became an opposition figure after being arrested over the fraud charges in 2002. He then fled Kazakhstan for Britain, saying that the accusations against him were politically motivated.

""In 2013, Italy was subjected to an incessant and massive influx of migrants from North Africa and the Middle East,"" Filippo Bubbico told parliament. Throughout the whole of 2013, a total of 2,925 vessels of various shapes and sizes landed on Italian shores, carrying about 43,000 people, including nearly 4,000 children. This represented a rise of 325 percent on the previous year. Bubbico also announced that Prime Minister Enrico Letta's coalition government intended to reduce the maximum amount of time people could stay in immigration detention centres - currently fixed at 18 months. Immigration charities estimate that between 17,000 and 20,000 migrants have died at sea trying to reach Europe over the past 20 years, often crossing on rickety fishing boats or rubber dinghies. Italy, one of the main landing points, launched a military and humanitarian operation to deal with the influx in October, after hundreds of migrants drowned in two shipwreck tragedies near the island of Lampedusa. Since then, it has saved more than 8,000 people from the sea, the defence ministry said last month.

Sitting silently in front of a whirling sewing machine, a calm Alireza Azimi gives little away of the perilous journey he has endured. Stepping away from his work for a moment, the story of the Iranian tailor slowly unravels in a Rome refugee centre where he has joined a collective of craftsmen. “I decided to come here for a better life, to be in a more open country...but it’s not how I thought it would be,” he tells The Local, in softly-spoken Italian. Azimi arrived in Italy nearly three years ago; one of the thousands of migrants to cross land and sea to reach Europe each year. SEE ALSO: 'Open legal routes to refugees': Malmström His own journey saw him smuggled across the Iran-Turkey border in a truck, which he still remembers as a “dangerous” and “very exhausting” few hours. Azimi made it to the Turkish capital, Istanbul, before crossing into Greece. Months after leaving Iran - and after a brief spell in a Greek immigration camp - he was on his way to Italy. “I went in a speedboat with around 12 people. We left at about 4.00am, when it was still dark,” Azimi remembers. “I had been told the journey was three and a half hours to Bari, but they lied. We went to Calabria and it took five and a half hours,” he says of his arrival in southern Italy. The detour away from Bari, the capital of Italy’s Puglia region, was said to be because of the high number of police there. Despite the change of plan, Azimi was relatively lucky in crossing the Mediterranean. So far this year, more than 66,000 people have arrived in Italy by boat. The majority have been trafficked from Libya in overcrowded fishing boats, while around 500 are thought to have died attempting the crossing this year.
Like many of the boat migrants who arrive in Italy, Azimi had little intention in staying for long. “I had decided to live in Holland or Germany, but unfortunately I arrived in Italy and I couldn’t go there,” he says. Under EU law, migrants must register in the first European country they arrive in and are restricted from going elsewhere. Azimi says he will have to wait two more years before he can have the chance to move elsewhere in Europe. As a result he has tried to find work in Rome, joining half a dozen fellow migrants at the Joel Nafuma Refugee Center (JNRC) for two days a week. There the group transforms magazines and other discarded items into crafts, which are then sold in the US and Italy. Other opportunities are hard to come by, he says: “The problem is that the wages are very low and there are a lot of workers. If I work somewhere for six months and they prefer someone else, I’ll lose my job immediately.” Azimi recognizes that he is more fortunate than many other people who seek asylum in Italy, such as those fleeing war zones. But still he thinks of the life he left behind: “When I was in Iran, I had work, I had a house, I always had friends. But I wanted to be in a situation where there was more freedom.” He thinks of returning to Iran or following his nephew to Australia, as hopes fade for a future in Europe. “I’m very tired now,” says the tailor, before returning to sit behind the sewing machine.

					09:11 CET+01:00				",AFP/The Local,Refugees and Roma ask to testify in mafia trial,"Refugees and Roma people are among a 150-strong group of people and organizations who have asked to be civil witnesses at the maxi Mafia trial which began in the capital on Thursday.
The group of would-be plaintiffs includes 37 Roma people, three refugees from Darfour and a political refugee from Pakistan, all of whom wish to argue that the defendants siphoned off funds that should have gone to a camp in the city where they were living.
The alleged ringleaders of a mafia gang whose criminal tentacles reached into almost every department of Rome's City Hall went on trial Thursday, on a landmark day for Italy's battle against organized crime.
Massimo Carminati, a convicted gangster with a history of involvement with violent far-right groups, and 45 others are accused of operating a mafia-style network that used extortion, fraud and theft to divert millions of euros destined for public services into their own pockets.
Carminati and his alleged right-hand man Salvatore Buzzi, a convicted murderer, followed Thursday's opening session in Rome's criminal court by video link from their prison cells, their presence in court having been deemed a security risk.
Subsequent hearings in a trial scheduled to run until next summer will be held in the Rebibbia prison on the outskirts of the capital.
Prosecutors say the racketeering in Rome went on for years, helped to bring the city to the brink of financial collapse and contributed to the current sorry state of its infrastructure and many of its public services.
Among those on trial are local politicians, businessmen and officials.
All are implicated in rigging tenders and other corrupt schemes designed to siphon off cash destined for everything from garbage recycling to the reception of newly-arrived refugees.
Hundreds more, including former mayor Gianni Alemanno, have been investigated in a case dubbed ""Mafia Capitale"" by prosecutors.
Morally rotten
The scale and nature of the case make it the most significant anti-corruption operation in Italy since the ""clean hands"" campaign of the early 1990s led to half the country's lawmakers being indicted for taking bribes.
Much of the trial is expected to be taken up with arguments over whether the accused individuals can be said to have constituted a mafia-type organization as defined by legislation designed to combat more traditional crime syndicates, such as Sicily's Cosa Nostra, the Neapolitan Camorra and Calabria's 'Ndrangheta.
If the prosecution can prove that they did, Carminati, 57, and Buzzi, 59, will face much tougher sentences than they would if found guilty simply of corruption.
Carminati's lawyer, Giosue Naso, said the prosecution were confusing a real mafia organization with the cronyism and nepotism endemic in Italian society.
""I'm from Calabria and my wife likes to joke that when a Calabrese looks for a dentist, they don't look for a good one, they look for a Calabrese one,"" he told reporters.
""It is the family-first approach of our society. This is about a morally rotten society, a society with a mafia culture - but that is not the same as real mafia organization.""
Middle world
For many non-Italian observers, the most eye-opening aspect of the case is that Carminati and Buzzi were ever able to get anywhere near public funds given their backgrounds.
Carminati was given a 10-year prison term in 1998 for having membership of the Banda della Magliana, a criminal crew which ruled Rome's underworld in the 1970s and 1980s and, prosecutors say, has reinvented itself in the form of Mafia Capitale.
Carminati is also a former member of the Nuclei Armati Rivoluzionari (Armed Revolutionary Nuclei), a far-right group that was involved in the 1980 bombing of Bologna railway station which left 85 people dead. He lost his left eye in a 1981 shoot-out with police.
Buzzi, a native of the Magliana suburb of Rome which gave birth to the notorious gang, was convicted in 1983 of murdering an accomplice in a cheque-stealing scam who confessed to police.
The brutal killing -- the victim was stabbed 34 times -- resulted in Buzzi receiving a 30-year prison sentence. But he served only six years after using his time behind bars to pursue his education and earn a reputation as a reformed character.
Much of the prosecution evidence is based on wiretaps obtained after judges accepted the prosecutors were dealing with a genuine mafia structure.
In one recording, Buzzi is heard boasting that skimming cash intended to feed and accommodate asylum-seekers from Africa and the Middle East is more lucrative than drug dealing.
In another, Carminati seems to describe himself and his associates as the link between the underworld and regular society. ""There are the living up above and the dead down below, we are in between, in this middle world where everyone meets,"" he is heard to say."

Police stopped the vehicle, which was heading north on Italy's A1 motorway, on Monday afternoon, after receiving a series of phone calls from terrified motorists who had spotted the desperate man while driving and feared he could fall at any minute.
Amid the heavy summertime traffic on the motorway, police managed to catch up with the truck just outside Frosinone, Lazio.
The lorry was stopped and the refugee freed from a makeshift harness he had fashioned under the vehicle using two belts.
It was unclear when exactly the man attached himself to the underside of the vehicle, but police believe he had travelled like that from the southeastern port of Brindisi, 400 kilometres from where the lorry was intercepted.
“By this point he was exhausted,” the police said in a statement. “He was then taken to a hospital in Frosinone.”

Despite the ordeal, the refugee, who is thought to be in his early 20s, is in good health and has been released to a migrant reception centre. He has however, been ordered to leave Italy within seven days after indicating he did not want to register an asylum request in the country.
The Bulgarian lorry drivers, who were on a trip from Turkey to Spain, said they had been unaware of the stowaway and were allowed to continue their journey.
Migrants and refugees in Italy regularly undertake dangerous and ridiculous journeys in a bid to make it to northern European countries where they believe they will have a brighter future.
Last week, Italian police arrested a 37-year-old, a resident of Nice, in Breil-sur-Roya, a French mountain hamlet close to the Italy's border, after he was caught smuggling eight Eritreans, including three women and two children, into France in his Citroen van.

Investigators believe he was planning to leave the refugee centre in Campomarino on Wednesday and head to Rome.
The man is said to have supported the Isis extremist group and tried to encourage migrants staying at the centre in Campomarino to join the jihadist cause.
Police said the imam, who also praised the November 13th Paris attacks, held services in the centre, but that some worshippers walked out after being alarmed by his preaching.
Police used phone tapping and hidden cameras during their two-month investigation. The camera showed the man watching videos of terrorist attacks, police said."

“It's now clear to everyone that we're facing an epochal crisis,” Federico Clementi, fundraising executive for UNHCR Italy, said in a statement.

More than 365,000 people, the majority being Syrian refugees fleeing war, have crossed the Mediterranean so far this year.
Some of Europe's wealthiest people have come forward with offers of help and donations since the picture of a three-year-old Syrian boy, whose body was washed up on a Turkish beach, caused a media sensation last week, prompting the EU to open its doors more.

Here are some figures about foreign nationals living in Italy, both legal and illegal.
How many foreigners live in Italy legally?
There are 5 million foreign nationals legally residing in Italy, according to figures from national statistics institute Istat, which is equivalent to around 8.3 percent of Italy's population of 60.5 million.
The biggest grouping of migrants come from Romania, accounting for just under a quarter of the total figure, or 23 percent. Another 9 percent are from Albania, 8 percent are Moroccan, 5.5 percent are Chinese and 4.5 are from Ukraine, with many employed in retail, farming or domestic work.

How many foreigners live in Italy illegally?
Focus is largely on the 690,000 migrants who have arrived by boat since 2013, most of them from sub-Saharan Africa. While some have papers, others don't – and most are still in the country.
Migration study foundation ISMU estimates there are some 500,000 people living in Italy illegally – equivalent to 0.9 percent of the population, among them failed asylum seekers and those who have outstayed their visas.
How many people arrive in Italy by boat?
Figures from the International Organization for Migration show that around 120,000 immigrants arrived in Italy by sea in 2017, with the government putting the cost of taking them in at €4.2 billion. Two-thirds of that figure was spent on caring for asylum seekers, while 18 percent went on sea rescue and 13 percent on medical assistance.
In 2013, there were 22,000 people in asylum centres. By January, that number stood at 182,000.
Are the numbers falling?
New hardline Interior Minister Matteo Salvini, who heads the nationalist League party, has said Italy ""cannot be Europe's refugee camp"", vowing to halt the influx of arrivals and expel hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants. And when the government was sworn in last week, Conte pledged to seek an overhaul of the so-called Dublin rules, under which would-be asylum seekers must submit applications in their country of arrival – a huge issue for Italy.
READ ALSO: Italy calls for tougher reforms of EU's asylum rules
But any change in the numbers coming from North Africa will depend largely on stabilisation efforts in Libya, and the sustainability of a controversial deal between Rome and the authorities and militias there which has slashed arrivals.
Following the deal, which was signed last summer, the number of migrants reaching Italian shores in the first five months of this year to June 8th stood at 13,808 – down 84 percent on the same period a year earlier, interior
ministry figures show.
There was also a 12 percent increase in expulsions last year, with ministry figures showing the number hit 6,514, up from 5,817 in 2016.

The UN's refugee agency (UNHCR) has written to the mayor of Rome voicing alarm over the hundreds of migrants sleeping rough on the capital's streets while thousands more with legal residency are forced to live in squats.
""We have been highlighting this problem for months and our worries have only increased,"" said Carlotta Sami, UNHCR's spokeswoman in Italy.
The protest to Virginia Raggi, Rome's recently-elected new mayor, comes a year after the closure of a large informal reception centre located close to the capital's Tiburtina train centre led to a spike in the number of migrants sleeping on the streets, often in makeshift camps that are regularly dismantled by the authorities.
Sami said Rome's could learn from Milan, where the city authorities have established a migrant reception ""hub"" with the express purpose of keeping people off the streets as winter sets in.
Raggi, a member of the populist Five Star Movement, said recently that her administration's priority was to stop the flow of migrants into the city.
""If we set up 100 tents, in two days we will have to provide 100 others,"" she argued.
The UNHCR said the Rome authorities could not turn a blind eye to thousands of refugees and other people granted leave to remain in Italy who were currently living in squats or informal camps in the centre of the Eternal City.
""This reality means there has to be reflection on developing concrete integration policies,"" UNHCR said in its letter.

The initiative, already deployed in other Italian cities including Turin and Genoa, comes as a bitterly contested deal to relocate hundreds of asylum seekers from Italy to other EU states has lagged.
In a plan put together by the city's authorities alongside the charity, Caritas, and the Italian Consortium of Solidarity (ICS), each family would have to host two asylum seekers for a maximum of six months and would be paid €400 a month for each person.
Some 700 migrants arrive in city, which is also a short distance from Croatia, each day.

“The families won't be left alone, they'll be assisted by Caritas and ICS,"" Laura Famulari, the councillor for social policies, said.
Needless to say, the anti-immigration Northern League was the first to take a swipe at the plan.

The new law also lets local police have Taser stun guns and makes it easier to evict squatters by getting rid of the obligation of finding provisional housing for the most vulnerable.
""Bad sign""
The controversial bill has been heavily criticised in recent weeks, including by members of the anti-establishment Five Star Movement which governs in coalition with Salvini's far-right League.
The head of Italy's bishops' conference Nunzio Galantino has lamented the fact that security and the treatment of migrants are dealt with in the same bill.
""This means that the immigrant is already judged because of his condition and that he's already considered a public menace, whatever his behaviour. This is a bad sign,"" Galantino said.
Salvini, who is also deputy prime minister, has taken a hardline on immigration since the coalition came to power in June, refusing to allow ships carrying migrants and asylum seekers rescued in the Mediterranean to dock at Italian ports.

					15:14 CEST+02:00				",The Local,Pope Francis takes 12 refugees back to Vatican,"UPDATED: Declaring ""we are all migrants,"" Pope Francis visited the Greek island of Lesbos on Saturday with a message of hope for those seeking asylum in Europe, 12 of whom he took home with him to the Vatican.
His one-day trip to Europe's migration hotspot culminated dramatically when three Syrian refugee families, all Muslim, returned with the pontiff to Rome
The pope told reporters that his gesture was ""a drop in the ocean"" but hoped that afterwards, ""the ocean will never be the same again"".
""All refugees are children of God,"" he said aboard the papal plane on its flight back to Rome.
The departure of the 12 refugees, who will be housed by the Vatican, was the climax of an emotional visit that saw migrants kneeling in tears before the 79-year-old Roman Catholic leader.
""You are not alone... do not lose hope,"" the pope, who was accompanied by Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew and Archbishop Ieronymos, the head of the Church of Greece, said at the Moria registration centre, where around 3,000 migrants are being held.
The vast majority have requested asylum but will likely be deported under a controversial agreement reached last month to tackle Europe's refugee crisis by sending all irregular migrants who land in Greece back to Turkey.
As the pope was escorted through Moria to meet a select number of migrants, one man broke into tears as he knelt at the pontiff's feet, requesting his blessing.
Another woman who slipped past security to approach the pontiff also broke down in tears as he paused to listen to her.
Other migrants gathered outside held hand-made signs that read ""We want freedom"", ""Let my people go"" and ""Papa cherche a nous sauver"" (""Pope, try to save us"").
A group of small children presented the pope with a dozen drawings.
Refugees are not numbers, they are people who have faces, names, stories, and need to be treated as such.
— Pope Francis (@Pontifex) April 16, 2016
Lesbos is one of the first ports of call in the EU for the hundreds of thousands of asylum-seekers who have fled war, poverty and persecution in the Middle East and Asia across the Aegean Sea via nearby Turkey in the past year.
The religious leaders said a prayer at Lesbos harbour in memory of the hundreds of migrants who have drowned during the voyage in overcrowded smuggler boats.
""Merciful God... though many of their graves bear no name, to you each one is known, loved and cherished,"" the pope said.
Earlier they signed a declaration calling on the international community to ""respond with courage"" to the humanitarian crisis and calling on religious communities to step up efforts to assist refugees.
The pope stressed that migrants were not numbers but people with ""faces, names and individual stories"" who were preyed on by ""unscrupulous thugs"" and called for ""resolute"" efforts to clamp down on arms trafficking.
""The world will be judged by the way it has treated you. And we will all be accountable for the way we respond to the crisis and conflict in the regions that you come from,"" Bartholomew said.
The refugee influx has sparked fierce disagreements between EU members and brought the bloc's system of open borders to the brink of collapse.
Lesbos has become the focus of criticism of the EU's deal with Turkey to take back migrants who travel to the Greek islands, in return for billions in EU cash.
All new arrivals on the island are being held at Moria while they wait to be processed to determine whether they can legitimately claim asylum or should be returned as ""economic migrants"". Rights groups have accused Greece of turning the centre into a detention camp.
Migrant arrivals in Greece have drastically fallen since the agreement took effect while the number of deaths among people making the perilous crossing has also dropped.
Another 125 arrived via the Aegean in the last 24 hours, including 46 on Lesbos, the Greek government said on Saturday.
The refugee families to be taken in by the Vatican, including six children, will be initially cared for by the community of Sant'Egidio in Rome, the Holy See said.
They come from Damascus and Deir Azzor, an area currently occupied by jihadists, and lost their homes to bombings, it said.
The pope said that all 12 had papers which were in order and that he had played no part in their selection.
""There were two Christian families but their paperwork wasn't ready. (Religion) was not grounds for exemption. All refugees are children of God.""
Francis had framed his visit as an exercise in raising awareness of the ""worst humanitarian disaster since the Second World War"".
The former Jesuit priest has repeatedly said he does not accept the EU's distinction between those fleeing conflicts, like the war in Syria, and those fleeing poverty and starvation created by global economic inequalities.
His trip to Lesbos followed an equally symbolic journey to the Italian island of Lampedusa in 2013.
There, in the aftermath of several deadly sinkings of people smugglers' boats packed with migrants, he made one of the most famous speeches of his term in office, railing against the ""globalisation of indifference"" which has allowed thousands to perish at sea in their pursuit of a better life for themselves and their families.
Over one million people crossed clandestinely from Turkey to Greece in 2015 and some 150,000 have made the trip since the start of this year."

					11:35 CEST+02:00				", The Local,Chaos in Como after Swiss send back refugees,"Around 100 refugees are reported to be camping out around Como’s San Giovanni station after being turned back by Swiss border guards.
Makeshift camps are springing up around the station in the northern Italian city to house hundreds of migrants who were sent back from Switzerland after attempting to enter the country illegally at the border crossing at Chiasso, in the canton of Ticino.
The backlog is turning Como into “an open-air refugee centre”, local politician Nicola Molteni told Milan newspaper Il Giorno.
And the blame is being placed squarely on Switzerland.
“Until last week an agreement with Switzerland allowed 100 migrants to cross into Chiasso every 15 days,” Alberto Sinigallia, president of Arca, a group which manages local refugee centres, told La Repubblica.
“That has been suspended for the time being, but it was an important release valve that helped us manage migrant flows,” he added.
Contacted by The Local, Walter Pavel of the Swiss border agency (EZV), could not confirm that any such agreement existed and said Switzerland was simply following the rules.
A migrant who wishes to seek asylum in Switzerland must present themselves at the border and request asylum.
If they do not – because they want to pass through Switzerland and request asylum in another country – they are not considered to have refugee status and are sent back to Italy.
“The number of migrants who submit an application for asylum at the border in Ticino with the Border Guard has decreased in the past few weeks,” Pavel told The Local.
“Migrants who wish to merely pass through (transit) Switzerland will be sent back by the Swiss Border Guard according to the readmission agreement with Italy.”
The number of illegal immigrants coming through the Ticino border crossing has increased with the recent warmer weather.
At the beginning of July Switzerland caught a record 1,300 migrants attempting to cross from Italy into Switzerland in one week alone. One Eritrean hopeful even made headlines after being filmed attempting to make it over the border crammed inside a suitcase.
And on Tuesday border guards caught 60 migrants without papers on a train in the Swiss city of Bellinzona. They were subsequently sent back to the border.
Of the 1,300 that arrived in the first week of July, 996 were sent back.
Switzerland’s rigidity in sticking to the rules is creating “A real emergency situation which risks paralyzing Como’s security system,” Como police chief Ernesto Molteni is quoted as saying by Swiss paper 24 Heures.
The camping migrants are being provided with meals and aid from the Catholic aid agency, Caritas. But with aid agencies already stretched to the limit experts say they will struggle to manage if the camp continues to grow.
“We’re providing food, clothes and trying to set up some showers for them,” said Caritas director Roberto Bernasconi, “But it’s very difficult, we’re already working to help the 2,000 migrants who are housed in Como’s refugee centers,” he added.
“The situation around the station is disgraceful,” said Lombardy governor, Roberto Calderoli, from Italy’s right-wing Northern League Party.
“Como is becoming the new Calais.”
But Ticino’s police chief hit back at the criticism.
“We register a big proportion of migrants who arrive in our centres, though they should have already been registered in Italy,” he told 24 Heures. “We are doing our bit.”
Under the Dublin rules of the Schengen agreement, immigrants must be registered in the country they first arrive in within the Schengen zone."

				16:59 CEST+02:00			 
					16:59 CEST+02:00				",AFP/The Local,600 empty buildings identified for migrants displaced by evictions,"Italian Interior Minister Marco Minniti is set to propose a series of measures to relocate migrants who are evicted from occupied buildings, following meetings with key stakeholders this week in Rome.
On Monday, Italian daily Repubblica reported that 600 empty buildings in various Italian cities had been identified by Minniti's team as potential places to relocate people, many of whom are migrants, who are evicted from illegally occupied buildings.
Minniti has also put forward the idea that properties confiscated from the mafia could be used as relocation centres.
The new guidelines are in response to the eviction of 800 migrants from a building in Rome ten days ago, that resulted in clashes between minority communities and the police.
On the morning of August 19th, police rushed into the building near Rome's Termini main train station, giving the 800 people inside a mere 15 minutes to vacate.
The building had been peacefully occupied since 2013 by mainly refugees and asylum seekers from Eritrea and Ethiopia, some in the country for as long as 15 years.
""I left everything behind,"" a 30-year-old refugee told AFP on condition of anonymity.
On Thursday, authorities returned to evict the remaining people, using water canons and batons to forcibly remove the hundred or so refugees still on the premises.
The violence quickly escalated, as the squatters responded by throwing gas canisters and rocks at police.
Top cardinal Pietro Parolin later condemned the violence ""on both sides"", while images of the clashes went viral in Italy.
One video which sparked outrage showed an official saying: ""Those people have to disappear, too bad for them. If they throw something, break their arm"".
While opposition parties on the extreme right welcomed the evictions, the UN refugee agency (UNHCR) voiced ""grave concern"".
UNHCR urged Italian authorities to ""find an immediate solution for the people currently sleeping under the stars and ensure adequate integration measures for those with a right to international protection"".
But relocating the Rome refugees has proved problematic. Italian authorities have proposed to relocate the refugees to housing about 75 kilometres (50 miles) from Rome, which would delay enrolment for children already registered in Roman schools.
And the city's leftist mayor has opposed the relocation, saying he has already welcomed 40 asylum seekers in a town of 3,100 people.
Several hundred people, mainly leftists and migrants, demonstrated in Rome Saturday against the evictions.

'Live like animals'
More than 600,000 people from Africa, Asia and the Middle East have arrived in Italy since 2014.
As it has become harder for such migrants to reach other European countries, Italy's reception facilities have come under strain and the centre-left government, facing elections next year, is under pressure on the issue.
Interior Minister Marco Minniti, who has ultimate responsibility for the initial eviction, has recently overseen a series of controversial moves aimed at ending the crisis.
These include steps to curb the activity of charity and other privately funded boats rescuing migrants in the Mediterranean and Italian naval support for Libyan coastguard efforts to intercept boats headed for Europe.
But Italy has proven to be a stable country for refugees and asylum seekers – 40 percent of whom are approved for a residence permit though thousands still wait for a decision.

Once approved, refugees go through a six-month integration process where they learn Italian and are offered job and education resources.
But many find themselves on their own because there aren't enough places available. And those who do manage to find jobs in a country with 37 percent youth unemployment may not be able to find adequate housing.
""In Italy, we live like animals,"" an Eritrean refugee told AFP on Wednesday last week after the building was partially cleared.
The 28-year-old, who requested anonymity, railed against EU rules that prevent him from joining family in Sweden or in Belgium.
Rome Mayor Virginia Raggi blamed the current immigration situation on ""years of negligence,"" adding that the ""absence of serious national policies"" has ""created a war between poor people"".

					10:50 CEST+02:00				",AFP,Syrian refugees come with 'money and tablets',"As the threat of US-led strikes on Syria looms large, even some of the country's wealthiest citizens are fleeing. Arriving on Italian shores with tablet computers and cash in hand, they mainly have their eyes set on refugee-friendly Sweden.
Thousands of Syrians have arrived so far this year in a markedly different type of influx to landings seen since the start of the Arab Spring revolts in 2011. Scores or even hundreds more arrive almost daily, in what officials say has created an ""emergency"" in Sicily. They are usually better off and better connected than the thousands of Eritreans and Somalians who also come and their final destination is Sweden, not Italy. ""They have money and are well-dressed, carrying tablets,"" said Carla Trommino, a local lawyer in Syracuse in Sicily where most of the Syrians have arrived. ""They try to avoid identification by the authorities because they want to go to Sweden and not end up in the system of Italian refugee centres,"" she said. Their Mediterranean journeys also begin in Egypt or Turkey, much farther afield than Libya or Tunisia where many recent asylum-seekers had started from. ""We often see relatives waiting with cars on the dock,"" said Trommino, who is also a local representative for the immigrant rights group ASGI. ""They stay one or two days and then escape,"" she added. Sweden this month became the first European Union country to announce it will give asylum and permanent resident status to all Syrian refugees who apply. Around 1,300 Syrians landed in Syracuse in August alone, compared to 646 landing in July, officials said. ""There has been a real intensification. We have had to call in reinforcements,"" Antonio Spampinato, the local border guard commander for Syracuse, told AFP. Entire families, unaccompanied children and pregnant women have been among those landing, fleeing the two-year civil war in hope of a better life in Europe. ""I do expect the Syrian crisis can lead to the worsening of the refugee problem,"" Italy's Prime Minister Enrico Letta said earlier this month. Interior Minister Angelino Alfano last week visited Syracuse and declared the refugee influx had become an ""emergency"" in Sicily - a part of Italy that has already been badly hit by a painful recession. He said Italy was tripling bed spaces in refugee centres to 16,000 in expectation of more arrivals and would push for a change in European asylum rules to facilitate family reunions - which would make it easier for Syrians to leave Italy for northern Europe. ""This region is unprepared. There aren't enough bed spaces and the refugee centres that are being used right now are informal ones,"" Trommino said. There have often been emotional scenes in Syracuse in recent weeks, with relatives embracing in the port after receiving word ahead of time about the arrivals. One Syrian woman gave birth during an eight-day voyage on a boat carrying 354 other refugees, while another died as she crossed with her husband and two children. The woman was a nurse in Damascus and her husband gave his permission for the donor use of her liver and kidneys, which saved three Italian patients. Several Syrians arriving have had to be hospitalised with dehydration in the hot summer sun, sometimes airlifted by helicopter directly from their boats. There have also been tensions: for example, when two Syrian men were unjustly accused by others on the boat of being crew members just because they had tried to defend their children's water rations in the crossing. Under Italian law, crew members are arrested and deported since aiding illegal immigration is a crime. Syrians say they pay around $3,000-$4,000 (€2,275-3,000) for adults and $1,500 for children for the trip. Spampinato said people smugglers had come up with a ""lucrative"" system to maximise their intake by taking large numbers of asylum-seekers across on ""mother ships"" - large fishing boats or cargo vessels. Before reaching Italian national waters, they are then transferred to smaller vessels to be taken to shore. ""We identify the mother ships but we cannot intervene because they are in international waters,"" he said. Similar smuggler routes from the eastern Mediterranean are used for the import of far more sinister cargo. On Friday, a police patrol off Sicily arrested nine Egyptian and Syrian crew members, plucking them from the sea after they set fire to their own ship, an 85-metre cargo vessel laden with drugs."

					15:30 CEST+02:00				",AFP,'Open legal routes to refugees': Malmström,"As EU ministers met on Tuesday to discuss how to help Italy deal with thousands of boat migrants, the European Commission said the refusal of member states to be flexible on asylum requests was fuelling the crisis.
""We must open legal routes to allow refugees to come to the European Union, otherwise they resort to illegal immigration channels,"" Home Affairs Commissioner Cecilia Malmström said ahead of a meeting of EU interior ministers in Milan. ""For the moment, the refugees have a very limited means of access to the European Union: through resettling. There is no other way,"" she said. Malmström suggested creating humanitarian visas or dealing with asylum requests at consulates in refugee camps and at points along migrants' journeys, such as the routes taken from Syria to Libya or Egypt. ""But those proposals have not gone down very well,"" she said. Sweden's minister for migration and asylum policy, Tobias Billström, said he would ""like someone to explain what a humanitarian visa is"". ""We have the resettlement programmes. All member states must participate, as Sweden and Germany do. Only 13 member states have this type of programme, while 15 have nothing,"" he said. The resettlement programmes were set up by the UN refugee agency (UNHCR) to allow member states - on a voluntary basis - to agree to take in a certain number of people that the agency believes can no longer live in refugee camps. ""The countries neighbouring Syria currently look after three million refugees, and fewer than 100,000 of them have been relocated to the EU's 28 countries. That is not very many,"" Malmström said. Asylum rules are very strict in the EU, where requests must be made in the country of entry. Once the registration process has begun - with the digital recording of fingerprints in particular - it is difficult for refugees to request asylum in another country. Traffickers 'making a fortune' While thousands arrive on Italy's coasts each year, many do not want to remain in the country and are forced to place themselves in the hands of traffickers to try to reach the European country of their choice.
The flow of migrants fleeing war zones and setting out from Libya to Italy, or from Turkey to Greece or Bulgaria, has sparked tensions within the EU. But the deaths of hundreds of boat migrants during their voyages across the Mediterranean in recent tragedies has thrust the issue into the the public eye. Border countries such as Italy complain they are being abandoned by their European partners to deal with the massive influx of people, while the northern countries insist they have their own migrants to deal with. ""When we look at the figures for arrivals in Italy, and compare them to the number of people who stay, there is a big difference. We have to talk about that,"" German Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere said. Sweden has accused the Italian authorities of letting refugees slip through the net without registration, so that they can be dealt with by another country, and Billström described as ""a big problem"" the fact that ""many of those arriving in Italy want to go to Sweden and Germany."" While the ministers praised Italy for its ""Mare Nostrum"" (""Our Sea"") operation - set up after nearly 400 migrants drowned last year off the island of Lampedusa last year - there have been complaints that the rescue mission actually encourages boats to set off. ""The traffickers know that the boats will be recovered [by the Italian navy], and are making a fortune"" out of the refugees, a European official told AFP. The number of migrant arrivals to Italy this year has now soared past the record 63,000 set in 2011 during the Arab Spring uprisings, with an average of 270 people being plucked off overcrowded boast each day. Italy has called on the EU to help with ""Mare Nostrum"" by providing funds and resources, and the Milan meeting should determine whether they are ready to do just that."

					09:15 CEST+02:00				",The Local,'Refugees can contribute positively to Italy',"As Italian politicians push the EU for more help with tackling the country's immigration crisis, The Local goes for breakfast at a refugee centre to see the reality behind the headlines.
As rush-hour buses trundle down Rome’s Via Nazionale, just a stone’s throw from Italy’s presidential palace, a group of men enjoy their morning coffee and pastry. But these are not the Italian businessmen who each morning tussle for space at the coffee bar, drinking their shot of caffeine at lightning speed. This breakfast ritual is unfolding underground, at the Joel Nafuma Refugee Center (JNRC), in the crypt of a church which has opened its doors to those in need. In the open hall a few dozen men file past a kitchen hatch, where enthusiastic volunteers hand out a watery cup of coffee and a pastry to each person. There is no dress code to join this informal breakfast club; some come in shirts, others in “Italia” sports tops. The common language is Italian one second, English the next. The majority of people hail from Afghanistan, Pakistan and Mali, while numerous other nationalities are also represented. Many have spent months travelling to Europe, often making the perilous boat journey across the Mediterranean which has claimed around 500 lives so far this year. The Italian navy last year launched an operation specifically to save boat migrants. Photo: HO/Italian navy/AFP While some of the those at the centre arrive enthusiastically, greeting eachother with “Buongiorno!”, many file down the line weary and silent. The latter are most likely the people who are forced to sleep rough, says Piero Rijtano, an Italian who works at the day centre. Others travel from the outskirts of the city from camps set up for new arrivals, where conditions are described as “sub-standard”. “Often these places aren’t controlled. They’re sub-standard in terms of hygiene. In winter there’s no hot water,” Rijtano says. SEE ALSO: 'Italy abandons refugees without food': UN Volunteers at the JNRC try to make up for what their guests may lack at night, by offering basic toiletries and clothes. New socks are snapped up as soon as they arrive, one volunteer tells The Local. The room becomes a hive of activity after breakfast, to the soundtrack of a bouncing table tennis ball. As well as giving people the chance to relax in the centre, decorated with bundles of balloons, workshops are offered on activities such as art therapy and craft-making. But the most important lesson of all, Rijtano says, is linguistic. “Not a lot of Italians speak English so if someone wants to work here, they must learn Italian. Everyone has this urgent need,” he says.
Even those who can master the language, however, know all too well that getting a job in Italy can be an impossible task. “Refugees don’t want to stay in Italy, because they know they can’t find work, but at the same time they have a better chance to get refugee status here than in other [European] countries,” says Rijtano. An Afghan man at the centre had recently arrived from Norway, where his asylum application had been rejected, paying more than €800 to people smugglers. The Italian authorities have now offered him an interview, in which he hopes to prove that he is in danger if returned to his home country. But for him and many other asylum-seekers in Rome, there are few opportunities to make a life for themselves. During the summer months a few of the JNRC’s regulars head south to work as farm labourers, while others become beach vendors. Unemployment is a national problem, affecting Italians across the country, and not one which can be changed overnight. Nevertheless, Rijtano believes some steps can be taken to improve the way Italy deals with the thousands of newcomers arriving each year. “Help at the first stage is extremely important,” he says. “Resources for the initial welcome should allow people to have the minimum level of cultural and linguistic integration to try and find work.” Mirroring the view of some of Italy’s leading politicians, Rijtano argues: “Europe should be accountable for the situation, because Italy doesn’t have any more resources.” READ MORE: 'No new funds for Italy migration': Malmström The JNRC itself is privately funded through the church, St Paul’s Within the Walls, a clear sign that the cash-strapped state lacks the necessary funds. While at the moment visitors to the centre are relying on the help offered, Rijtano says they have the potential to make a positive contribution to Italy. “In England and other countries that are used to immigration, it is seen as more of a resource than a problem,” he explains. “I remember the first time I went to London, it was a revelation! Now in Rome there are a number of communities, and it’s beautiful to see.”"

					15:12 CEST+02:00				",AFP,Milan exhibition highlights migrant odyssey,"An exhibition in Milan is offering through the lens of 65 photographers an original look at the topic of immigration and the migrant crisis.
The Restless Earth, organised by the Nicola Trussardi foundation, is being presented by the Visual Arts Program of Milan's Triennale, the title alluding to works by Caribbean poet Edouard Glissant on how different cultures can live together.
The exhibition with works from photographers from some 40 countries, including Syria and Turkey, is an ""exercise in empathy, understanding, inter-cultural dialogue"" to facilitate ""a future together,"" Trussardi says.
Their works are designed to show migrants' experiences but also hint at perceptions of new arrivals amid the worst refugee crisis Europe has known since World War II.
Italy has been in the front line of the crisis, receiving tens of thousands of migrants attempting the dangerous sea crossing from Libya in vessels that often are barely seaworthy.
Included in the exhibition, which runs through August 20, are 26 powerful images taken by AFP photographer Aris Messinis depicting their hazardous journeys.
Another powerful exhibit is Syrian Manaf Halbouni's ""Nowhere is Home,"" comprising a car crammed full of objects to symbolise the transient existence of refugees with nowhere to call their own.

Also throwing into stark relief the human cost of the migrant crisis is an exhibit of passports, damaged mobile phones and other personal items from refugees who drowned off Lampedusa, an island near Sicily where hundreds of Africans drowned when their vessels capsized in 2013.
Milan itself is an industrial economic hub in the north of Italy where the anti-immigrant Northern League has sought to extract political capital from the migrant crisis, a divisive issue across the country.
In January, tensions boiled over as residents at a migrant reception centre near Venice set the facility ablaze after the death of a female refugee which residents blamed on a long delay in getting her medical treatment.
Over 1,000 migrants are thought to have died making the dangerous voyage from Libya to Italy so far this year, according to the UN's refugee agency, with nearly 37,000 rescued and brought to camps around the country."

""hotspots"" for identifying newly-arrived migrants - but as the Pozzallo reception centre in Sicily prepares its fingerprinting kits, the EU-led plan
for these facilities is still plagued with unresolved issues.
For now, the vast hanger overlooking the sea in southern Italy hosts the majority of migrants landing here each week, giving them time to wash and rest before they are sent on to more permanent centres to file asylum requests.
From there, up to two thirds of migrants ditch their newly found lodgings to continue their journey north towards a new life - creating a flow of undocumented people across borders that the European Union is determined to stem.
When Pozzallo becomes an official ""hotspot"" at the end of November, new arrivals will instead be obliged to provide their fingerprints as part of an asylum request, or be taken to a detention centre to await expulsion from Italy.
The hotspots will be closed-door centres, sharply reducing the chance that people can flee and head north off their own backs.
Those very likely to win refugee status - Syrians, Eritreans and Iraqis - will be fast-tracked and taken to a separate centre, where they will be divided up and distributed to other countries within the European Union.
But an experimental phase begun two weeks ago on Italy's Lampedusa island has revealed potential stumbling blocks in the ""hotspot"" process.
What will happen if Syrian or Eritrean nationals refuse to give their fingerprints, seeing as they cannot be expelled? Would they be kept in a detention centre until they change their minds?
Once asylum seekers are sorted and placed in open centres, will Italy continue to look the other way if they hop the fence and head for the border?
And how easy will it be to convince those hoping to join relatives or friends in Germany and Sweden to accept a place in Portugal or Lithuania instead?
""They probably won't be completely satisfied, but we try not to think about it, so as not to get demoralized,"" Angelo Malandrino, deputy director of the civil liberties and immigration department at Italy's interior ministry, told AFP.
Flaws in the system
Carlotta Sami, spokeswoman for the UN refugee agency in Italy, said the hotspot scheme ""will work only if the rules are clear and the quality of reception is high right from the start"", adding that the agency would be keeping an eye on the process.
There will also be representatives from a whole host of other European bodies on site: the asylum support office (Easo), border control (Frontex), the EU's law enforcement agency (Europol) and judicial network (Eurojust).
Priorities will not only include registering and caring for migrants, but also investigating the smuggling networks which load hundreds of people into rickety boats to cross the Mediterranean, and any possible terrorist threat from new arrivals.
While Pozzallo's high walls give it a grim aspect, inside is decorated with children's drawings and multilingual signs. There is little privacy, however, with dozens of people sleeping side-by-side on closely packed bunk beds.
The centre was built to host 180 people but can house up to 250. With the other ""hotspots"" planned across the country, Italy's total capacity will allow for some 1,500 people to go through the identification process at any one time.
Critics - who point out that arrivals of between 4,000 and 6,000 people in 48 hours are not uncommon in Italy - argue the system is at risk of being quickly overstretched, and collapsing.
They also say the ""hotspot"" system will increase the load on Italy, which is already shouldering a mammoth task as a first point of call for people fleeing warzones and persecution.
Rome will help distribute Syrians and Eritreans across Europe, keeping them out of the hands of people-traffickers.
But the ""hotspot"" plan means nationalities that would otherwise have quickly moved on - Somalis, Sudanese and Ethiopians, for example - will now be forced to remain in Italy for up to 24 months while their asylum requests are processed.
According to the latest statistics, between January 2014 and May 2015 some 90,000 of the 217,000 migrants arriving in Italy applied for asylum.
Of the rest, over 37,000 were neither Syrians nor Eritreans - meaning that Rome may be looking at finding beds for close to 40,000 extra people once the hotspots launch.
And there will be another fallout: by holding on to a greater number of people whose asylum applications are less than guaranteed, Italy will likely see an increase the number of complex and expensive expulsions required.
That issue has already prompted the country to call urgently for the creation of a European expulsion system."

Coast guard and navy vessels rescued the migrants from troubled boats off the coast of Sicily on Friday and Saturday, rushing four of them -- a mother, father and their two young children -- to hospital for emergency care, the coast guard said. One broken-down boat was carrying 207 migrants from Nigeria, Ghana and Eritrea, including six children and two women in the late stages of pregnancy. Another boat was carrying 212 migrants including eight children and was being towed toward the tiny island of Lampedusa, Italy's southernmost point. The coast guard did not say where the passengers were from. Two other boats carrying a total of 293 Syrians and Egyptians were brought Friday to Augusta, on the eastern coast of Sicily. The number of refugees trying to reach Italy in dinghies and other boats has increased in recent months because of surging violence in Syria and Egypt and calm summer weather that has tempted many to try their luck on the seas. The Italian interior ministry says 3,000 Syrians arrived in Italy from the beginning of the year to the end of August, mostly arriving by boat in eastern Sicily."

					14:35 CEST+02:00				",The Local,Italian mayor defends request for refugees to use separate buses,"A mayor in northern Italy faced backlash after asking refugees to avoid using the same buses as local schoolchildren, with the regional representative of PM Renzi's democratic party likening the segregation to ""apartheid"".
But he's sticking to his decision.
The mayor of Calizzano, a town near Savona in northern Italy, held a meeting with the local bus company and the owners of the hotel where 40 refugees are currently staying, to request that the migrants use a different bus from schoolchildren.
The mayor, Pierangelo Oliviero noted that since the bus only had space for 48 people, and children had to take either the 6.30 or 6.45 bus in order to reach school on time, the migrants staying at the Hotel Lux should use a different mode of transport.
The head of the Democratic Party in Liguria, Raffaella Paita, condemned Oliviero's decision, calling it ""shameful"" and comparing it to the segregation in America in the early 20th century.
""Those who speak of apartheid are right,"" she was cited by Italian media as saying. ""Problems are not resolved by discriminating against people.""
However, Oliviero pointed out that he had not imposed an outright ban, but merely suggested that refugees avoid using the crowded bus which commuters and students were forced to take.
""It's simply a matter of common sense,"" he said, according to local paper Il Vostro Giornale.
The local branch of the National Association of Italian Municipalities (Anci) defended Oliviero, saying the policy was ""nothing to do with racism"" and that Calizzano was a ""virtuous"" town, which had been among the first to accept migrants and help them integrate.
Anci noted that the town of 1,500 was hosting 40 migrants in the local Hotel Lux, a significantly higher number than the 24 originally agreed.
Tension and crowded centres
Police had recently been called to the Hotel Lux to break up a brawl among some of the refugees, Il Giornale reported, while there were also accusations that migrants were not all paying for their transport tickets and behaving inappropriately around women and girls on the bus.
Italy's migrant centres are overcrowded, due to a steady flow of arrivals and the closure of borders with France and Italy. Furthermore, these centres have not received a cent of government funding in months.
The increase in the number of migrants has led to social tensions, and Calizzano is not the only Italian town that has seen newcomers 'segregated'.
Earlier in the month, it emerged that two refugee children at a school in Sardinia were asked to use different toilets from the other children, after parents voiced fears that the boys might have contagious illnesses."

					13:18 CEST+02:00				",Angela Giuffrida,"An Afghan refugee: safe, but in limbo in Italy","He escaped captivity, lost his family and paid a people smuggler to take him to Italy. But now here, an Afghan refugee tells The Local that although he's still alive, his future remains precarious.
Some €500,000 - that was the price on Rakeen's head when he was kidnapped in Kabul in 2008, by one of the many criminal gangs that had emerged in Afghanistan in the aftermath of the US-led invasion.
And in revenge for the rising literary star, who was 25 at the time, miraculously escaping captivity four months later, the gang went to his family home and shot dead his father and four younger siblings.
It was only by chance that Rakeen wasn't killed too. On the night of the shootings, he had been at the hospital visiting his mother, who was recovering from a heart attack.
Now in Italy after being turned away for asylum in Norway, Rakeen might well be safe, but he is completely alone and in limbo.
The abduction turned his life upside down in every sense. Until then, he had been studying for a degree in psychology, while his books condemning the Taliban were receiving acclaim.
But coming from a relatively wealthy family meant he was also a prime target for his abductors.
“I had a wonderful life. We had money.. we had a car, a beautiful house, everything a person could have wanted and needed,” he tells The Local.
The captors wanted the ransom money from his father, the owner of a car sales business, and would torment him and his wife with photos and videos of their eldest son being beaten and tortured.
“They threatened them to not tell the police. This still this goes on in Afghanistan today... even for just €100, they're ready to kill someone.”
During his four months in captivity, Rakeen was fed bread and water – purely to keep him alive until the ransom was paid.
But this, ultimately, went in his favour.
“After the guard came into my room one morning to give me food and let me use the bathroom, he forgot to re-tie my hands behind my back,” he says.
Heart pounding, Rakeen waited until he was certain the guard wouldn't return, and then climbed up to a small window.
In a struggle that took him about half an hour, he managed to squeeze himself out of the window, before tumbling two floors to the ground.
“It was so small – I could see my bone as I tried to push my left shoulder through - I think losing a lot of weight during that time helped,” he says.
“It was also a miracle that I managed to land feet-first. I was in so much pain, but I just ran as fast as I could. I didn't stop to think.”
Rakeen kept running until he reached a busy road, and flagged down a taxi.
“The taxi driver was a good man. He took me to the nearest police station, where I reported the kidnappers. They knew I was missing as my father had reported it, despite the threats. They managed to arrest some of the kidnappers, but the others fled.”
But the happy reunion with his family was overshadowed by a steady flow of threats of revenge from the abductors who had managed to escape. The family moved to a different area in Kabul, but seven months later, the kidnappers found them.
After his father, two brothers and two sisters – the youngest of whom was just seven years old – were murdered, Rakeen and his mother, a history teacher, sought help from extended family. But none came.
“They were scared for their own safety,” he says.
“The only person who offered to shelter us was an old school friend.”
Norway asylum request rejected
Still living under the shadow of a threat to their safety, Rakeen's mother encouraged her son to leave Afghanistan. The plan was for him to seek asylum in Europe and for her to join him later.
He caught a plane to Sweden, and from there travelled overland to Norway. But Norwegian authorities rejected his request for asylum, even though he provided strong evidence that his life was in danger, advising him instead to move to a safer part of Afghanistan.
His only hope was Italy, which he'd heard was the only EU country that didn't send migrants back to the first country in which they had applied for asylum.
Any money he had left was used to pay a people smuggler, who took him south to Italy.
“Italy was my only hope,” he says.
But coming to Rome, despite finally being safe, brought more hardship. Soon after arriving in 2012, his mother had another heart attack, and died.
Rakeen spent the first year or so living in a tent with other Afghan refugees on the outskirts of the capital. After starting his asylum process, he was then allocated a bed at a state-run refugee centre, which he said was ""filled with insects and mice"".
But there are restrictions on the amount of time refugees can stay at the centres, and so by this summer, Rakeen was homeless again.
""I perceived Rome to be a Holy city...but the reality I found was inconsistent with my perception. I didn't come as a tourist, I came to save my life.""
He says that during this time, the only thing that kept him going was his late mother's words of encouragement.
""If I'd lost her at the same time as the rest of my family, I think I would have gone crazy. She gave me hope, she was a good teacher, to her children and to her students.""
But things started to improve when Rakeen discovered the Joel Nafuma Refugee Centre, which, located in the basement of a church in central Rome, has become a sanctuary for those who have fled war and persecution.
Volunteers there provide breakfast as well as basic items, such as razors, toothpaste and second-hand clothing. They also give lessons in Italian and psychological support to refugees.
It is also a place where refugees can come and meet each other, play board games, watch films, and build a livelihood.

Together with a group of other refugees, Rakeen formed the Artisans Together project. In a room at the centre, they spend their days making cards, baskets and other arts and crafts, which they hope to sell. As well as giving them purpose, it's their only means of income, however small. He said the work they do has helped to restore ""the feeling of belonging"".
""Even though I have documents for Italy now, it's a struggle to find a job, and I can't leave for anywhere in the EU with more prospects.""
It was through the centre that Rakeen met the volunteers behind Paul's Place Project (PPP), a fledgling housing project in Rome which is finds landlords willing to house refugees.
After sleeping on a park bench for a few weeks this summer, he moved to a flat in a town on the outskirts of Rome.
""If it wasn't for all of these volunteers, I'd have no hope. They there take care of us like we're part of their family.""
But without a stable income, Rakeen finds it hard to think about the future, while any aspirations he does have are simple.
“I would just like to be like other human beings,” he adds.
“With a house, wife, children, job...just comfortable...nobody wants to be a refugee forever.”"

					12:19 CET+01:00				",AFP,Italian takes UNHCR helm amid migrant crisis ,"Italian diplomat Filippo Grandi began work on Monday as the new head of the UN refugee agency, facing the mammoth task of leading efforts to deal with record levels of displacement worldwide.
""UNHCR is navigating extraordinarily difficult waters,"" Grandi said in a statement on Monday.
""The combination of multiple conflicts and resulting mass displacement, fresh challenges to asylum, the funding gap between humanitarian needs and resources and growing xenophobia is very dangerous,"" he said.
The 58-year-old diplomat officially replaced Antonio Guterres on January 1st, when the former Portuguese prime minister stepped down after a decade at the helm of the refugee agency.
But Grandi arrived for his first day of work at the UNHCR headquarters in Geneva on Monday morning, the agency said, adding that he was taking the wheel ""at a time of unprecedented displacement challenges.""
Late last year, the agency announced that the number of people displaced by war and violence hit a record high of more than 60 million in 2015 - surpassing even the 50-million mark reached during World War II.
Europe too faced its worst migration crisis since 1945, with over a million men, women and children reaching its shores in 2015.
Most of those risking the perilous journey across the Mediterranean mainly to Greece and Italy were refugees desperately fleeing war and persecution in Syria, Afghanistan and Iraq.
Over 3,700 people drowned or went missing at sea, UNHCR said.
The choice of Grandi for the key post was seen as a nod to Italy, which has been particularly hard-hit by the refugee crisis in Europe.
Denmark's restrictive policies on refugees were meanwhile cited among the factors weighing against one of his competitors, former Danish prime minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt.
Long career in aid work
Grandi was also recognized for his work in several tough UN positions over a 30-year career in international affairs.
Among them was his challenging work as head of the UN Palestinian refugee agency UNRWA from 2010 to 2014, a post he held after serving as its deputy from 2005 to 2010.
Grandi had previously worked as deputy envoy to the UN aid mission in Afghanistan and was UNHCR's mission chief there.
He has also been involved in UNHCR efforts in Sudan, Syria, Turkey and Iraq, and led humanitarian operations in Yemen and the Democratic Republic of Congo.
But leading the UN refugee agency at this historic juncture could prove his toughest task yet.
""The road ahead is a challenging one,"" Grandi said.
""But I hope that - working with governments, civil society and other partners - we will make progress in ensuring international protection and improved living conditions for millions of refugees, internally displaced and stateless people."""

Italy approved 16,185 asylum applications in 2013 and rejected 9,060, according to figures from the EU’s Eurostat agency. A total of 3,110 people were given refugee status, while 13,075 more people at risk were given lower levels of protection and allowed to stay in the country. Nigerians, Pakistanis and Somalis made up the highest numbers of asylum-seekers in Italy, compared to the broader European picture where most people seeking refuge in 2013 came from Syria, Russia and Afghanistan. Across Europe, the number of people seeking asylum jumped from 335,000 in 2012 to 435,000 last year. Fifty thousand of these came from Syria, although the EU’s 28 countries took just a fraction of the 2.5 million registered refugees fleeing the country’s three-year conflict. The new figures show that Italy received six percent of the EU’s total asylum applications, while Germany topped the chart with 29 percent, followed by France, Sweden and the UK. While Italy is among the top countries in Europe for asylum-seekers, the number is relatively low when compared to the country’s large population. There were just 470 applications per million people in Italy last year, well below the European average of 860 and far from Sweden’s 5,680 or the 5,330 in nearby Malta. Although the Eurostat data show that Italy was better than many European countries in granting asylum, the country has recently come under fire for its treatment of people seeking asylum. Last month the UK’s Supreme Court blocked the deportation of four asylum seekers, over claims that they would face mistreatment if sent back to Italy.

					04:48 CET+01:00				",AFP,Pope says he 'wept' while meeting Rohingya refugees,"Pope Francis on Saturday said he wept hearing the plight first-hand of Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh, adding that this meeting was a condition set for his trip to Myanmar and Bangladesh.
The Rohingya meeting was a highly symbolic gesture of solidarity with the Muslim minority fleeing violence in Myanmar, and the pontiff told journalists on his plane flying back to Rome that the refugees cried as well.
""I knew that I was going to meet the Rohingyas but I did not know where and how, for me it was one of the conditions of the trip,"" he said.
The usually forthright pontiff walked a diplomatic tightrope during his four days in Myanmar -- the first papal visit to the country -- avoiding any direct reference to the Rohingya in public while appealing to Buddhist leaders to overcome ""prejudice and hatred"".
In Bangladesh he addressed the issue head-on, meeting a group of Rohingya refugees from the squalid camps in southern Bangladesh in an emotional encounter in Dhaka.
""What Bangladesh has done for them is enormous, it's an example of welcome,"" he said. ""I wept, I tried to do it in a way that it couldn't be seen. They wept too.""
""I told myself 'I cannot leave without saying a word to them'"".
The pope told the Rohingya: ""In the name of all those who have persecuted you, who have harmed you, in the face of the world's indifference, I ask for your forgiveness.""
The pope referred to the refugees as Rohingya, using the term for the first time on the tour in Bangladesh after the archbishop of Yangon advised him that doing so in Myanmar could inflame tensions and endanger Christians.
The word is politically sensitive in mainly Buddhist Myanmar because many there do not consider the Rohingya a distinct ethnic group, regarding them instead as interlopers from Bangladesh.
""If I had used the word during an official speech I would have slammed the door,"" he said, adding: ""They already knew what I thought. For me the most important thing is that the message gets through.""
The pope said he was ""very satisfied"" with his meetings in Myanmar and hinted that he expressed his opinion far more freely in private conversations with the country's leaders than in his public appearances.
More than 620,000 Rohingya have crossed into Bangladesh since a militant attack on police posts in late August sparked a deadly crackdown by the Myanmar military.
They have given consistent accounts of mass rape, killings and villages deliberately burned to the ground by soldiers and Buddhist militia.
The two countries last month signed an agreement to begin repatriating refugees to Myanmar, but rights groups say they are concerned about plans to house them in camps away from their former homes -- many of which have been destroyed.
During his tour the pope led well-attended open-air masses in Bangladesh and Myanmar, which both have small Christian populations.

				1 August 2016
				10:40 CEST+02:00			 
					10:40 CEST+02:00				",The Local,How Brexit has helped to expose Italy’s banking malaise,"Brexit has triggered a financial chain reaction that has also exposed the problems of the Italian banking system.
The UK’s decision to leave the EU made investors fearful that the union would face a new crisis or even break up. This led to a swift withdrawal of their funds from the most fragile sections of Europe’s financial markets.
Italian banks are one of these areas. The graph below shows the steep fall of Italy’s FTSE Italia All-Share banks index following the UK’s referendum result.
The main problem with Italy’s banks is that they are swamped with what are known as non-performing loans (NPLs). These are loans on which debtors have not made scheduled payments for at least 90 days.
In other words, Italian banks are not getting back some of the money they have lent out. According to data from the Bank of Italy, NPLs of Italian banks amounted to €360 billion in 2015, or 18.1% of all loans they made (see graph below). Of these loans, €210 billion are really bad and no longer collectable. The remaining €150 billion are of slightly higher quality.
Italian banks are incredibly exposed to NPLs. They equal almost a quarter of Italy’s GDP and a third of the total NPL exposure of EU members. Practically speaking, NPLs are a big drag on the ability of Italian banks to finance investments and growth in the real economy. Accordingly, it is a major threat to the stability of the entire EU.
The NPL problem has its origins in the seven-year recession that followed the 2008 global financial crisis and the ensuing European sovereign debt crisis. The reason is simple: if the economy does not go well, companies and households struggle to repay their debt to the banks.
However, another cause of the NPL problem is the fact that Italian bank managers also made bad investment decisions, often allocating loans on the basis of favouritism. Hence, it would not be an exaggeration to say that an independent inquiry on the issue should be established, a sort of NPL audit which should be open to independent experts and civil society.
Government incapacity
Another cause of the NPL crisis is the Italian government’s inability to solve the issue, as other European countries have. Germany and France for example intervened directly with state funds to provide new capital to their banks, thanks also to relatively more solid public finances.
Ireland and Spain have instead used bad banks co-funded by both state and private investors. These so-called bad banks use these funds to buy other financial institutions' bad loans. They focus on managing the non-performing assets, for instance by trying to recover the money from borrowers. The other institutions, relieved of their bad debts, can instead healthily resume their normal activities of lending and borrowing. Direct state bail-out and bad banks are not mutually exclusive solutions. In fact, they are often used together.
In the case of Italy, the government could not intervene directly with public money. Italy’s huge public debt does not give fiscal space for substantial public funds going to struggling banks. Some exceptions were made for several banks including Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena in the period 2008-2012.
More importantly, by the time the Italian government decided it would do something about four small troubled banks in 2015, new EU rules, including a bail-in, were already on their way to being fully implemented. These dictate that when a bank is in crisis, its creditors – bondholders and depositors together with shareholders – would bear the burden by having part of the debt they are owed written off. This was so that governments could avoid rescuing banks using taxpayer money.
To cut a long story short: Italy’s banks are in a dire enough situation to require direct state intervention, but this cannot be done under current EU banking regulation. As a result, the Italian government is negotiating with the European Commission to develop alternative and more complex solutions which avoid relying on taxpayer money. Unfortunately, these would merely keep the banks alive, but do not thoroughly restructure their governance and business strategies so that they could start lending again.
At this point, the most appropriate solution would be to inject public capital into the banking system under strict conditions which impose a more effective governance and business strategy on the bailed-out banks. The Swedish case in 1992 shows that banks can be held responsible and the government can become an owner. What is more, the Swedish government was also able to make a profit once it sold the shares of the banks later on.
Direct state intervention would prevent small investors from having their savings wiped out. These retail investors hold a third of all bonds issued by Italian banks, but are not always fully aware of the risks their bank managers exposed them to. More generally, direct state intervention would help kickstart economic growth in a country that so desperately needs it.

The EU adopted a scheme in September to relocate 160,000 Syrian, Iraqi and Eritrean refugees from Greece and Italy but only 885 people have been moved to other member states since then.
European Migration Commissioner Dimitris Avramopoulos told a press conference that several member states have not yet offered to take a single asylum seeker.
But he said last week ""we experienced the swift relocation of 287 people"", the vast majority from Greece.
""We need to build on that positive experience and reach a speed of at least 6,000 people a month,"" Avramopoulos said during talks among EU interior ministers about efforts to tackle Europe's worst refugee crisis since the Second World War.
Avramopoulos recalled that he had written to the interior ministers of the 28-nation bloc to speed up the relocation scheme which was designed to boost solidarity with frontline states.
""If relocation does not work, then the whole system will collapse,"" Avramopoulos warned. But he added: ""I am more than optimistic we will achieve this goal.""
European sources blame the delays in relocating people on a series of factors: governments trying to screen for potential jihadists in the wake of the Paris attacks, a lack of housing and education for asylum-seekers, and logistical problems over chartering planes.
They say some countries are setting unacceptable conditions by refusing Muslims, black people or large families, with Eastern European states the worst for discriminating on religious or racial grounds."
