					15:19 CEST+02:00				", The Local,Sweden turns down migrants docked in Italy,"
Sweden has refused to take in a group of nearly 200 migrants stuck on a ship in an Italian port. 

	Italian coastguard ship Diciotti arrived at Sicily late on Monday night after picking up 177 people near the southern Italian island of Lampedusa, including an estimated 30 unaccompanied minors.

	The vessel was allowed to dock, but the migrants have been denied permission to disembark.

	The country’s hardline interior minister, Matteo Salvini, has threatened to take them to Libya unless other EU countries take them in, despite reports of serious abuse in North African detention camps.

	Swedish Prime Minister Stefan Löfven on Wednesday confirmed reports by Swedish public radio that his centre-left coalition government had declined requests to let the migrants on board seek asylum in Sweden.

	""Other countries have to step up and show that they want to take responsibility,"" he told newswire TT.

	He said Sweden, which received around 163,000 asylum requests in 2015, took on a ""huge responsibility"" at the time but has since tightened its migration policies. By the end of 2018, the Migration Agency expects 23,000 people to have applied for asylum in the Nordic country this year.

	A spokesperson for the EU's migration commission told Italy's Ansa news agency this week that member states had been approached about the situation and ""we are working to find a solution as soon as possible"".

	""The people aboard have suffered abuse, torture [and are] victims of human trafficking,"" commented the spokesperson for the UN's refugee agency in Italy, Carlotta Sami. ""They urgently need assistance and the right to claim asylum. A fundamental right, not a crime.""

	According to the latest figures from the UNHCR, the crossing from North Africa to southern Italy is becoming more deadly: more than 1,500 people died making the journey between January and July, or one in every 17 who tried. The death rate tripled this year compared to the same period in 2017.

					14:50 CEST+02:00				", The Local,Wildfires and migrants: the issues defining the Swedish election,"
OPINION: Anamaria Dutceac Segesten, senior lecturer in European studies at Lund University, examines the issues grabbing headlines ahead of the Swedish election. 

	Sweden is heading for a general election on September 9, with two pressing political issues driving the agenda. But a third, simmering problem could yet define the next parliament.

	More than 50 wildfires raged across Sweden during the summer of 2018 – the warmest summer since 1756. So severe was the problem that the Swedish government had to request help from the EU. The gravity of the situation brought environmental questions to the fore, as the effects of climate change became more tangible than ever.

	All this has provided new impetus to the struggling Green Party which had looked unlikely to secure the four percent of votes needed to secure seats in the national parliament but now looks likely to reach that threshold. A similar turnaround took place in the 1988 election, when a sudden outbreak of seal pest, a contagious disease that kills the young of the species, helped the Greens enter the Riksdag for the first time.

	But the event most defining these elections is the refugee crisis.

	In the autumn of 2015, Sweden opened its doors to asylum seekers from Syria and elsewhere, taking in more than 100,000 people over a period of just a few months. Managing the influx of people proved difficult and the Social Democrat/Green coalition government had to introduce a much stricter version of its asylum policy as a result.

	This effectively closed down Sweden's southern border with Denmark and temporarily suspended the Schengen agreement, which allows free movement through continental Europe. The switch from an open-door policy to a very restrictive approach to asylum, and the poor way in which new arrivals were managed cast a shadow of doubt over the competence of prime minister Stefan Löfven. His Social Democratic Party is now likely to see a significant drop in voter support.

	The refugee crisis has had a major impact on Swedish politics. The Sweden Democrats, a staunchly anti-immigration party, has thrived on migration becoming a major concern for many citizens. Current polls show that the party is projected to win about 20 percent of the vote – its best ever result by a significant margin.

READ ALSO: The Local's coverage of the Swedish election

	However, the crisis has had a far broader affect on political discourse. In February 2013, Tobias Billström, then immigration minister for the Conservative Party, was reprimanded by his party leader for proposing capping the number of non-EU citizens allowed to residency in Sweden. Today, the same Conservative Party, under the new leadership of Ulf Kristersson, has not shied away from proposing a very similar policy.

	The refugee crisis has normalized the topic of immigration management, which has affected the agendas of every political party running in this election. All have been forced to take a position on the subject, which has, in turn, made it a deeply polarizing topic.

	The political field has been divided into those who are in favour of a more generous immigration approach (Social Democrats, the Left, the Greens and the Centre Party) and those who prefer a stricter policy (the Conservatives, the Christian Democrats, the Sweden Democrats and to some extent, the Liberals). Disagreements over immigration may even lead to a split within the centre-right Alliance that held power in two consecutive governments (2006-2010 and 2010-2014), with the Centre Party defecting from the group position to embrace a more restrictive immigration approach.

	While the event of the refugee crisis was the spark that ignited the recent debate on immigration, the topic is connected to longer-term transformations in Swedish society. Political parties are also seeking answers to the difficulties caused by an ageing population, synonymous with a large number of retirees and high demand on the healthcare and elderly-care systems.

	Integrating non-EU migrants into the labour market has been a slow process. And, if you add into the mix the generous welfare benefits traditionally provided by the Swedish state (long parental leave, free education at all levels, subsidised healthcare), the dilemma faced by Swedish politicians is evident. The biggest issue of this (and coming) elections will really be the future of the welfare state. Parties must either find creative solutions to finance public services – or propose cutting some of them.

					07:59 CEST+02:00				", The Local,'Political participation of migrants in Sweden is important for the quality of democracy',"
OPINION: Sweden's democracy is very inclusive – but it relies on people using their right to participate, write Adina Trunk and Lina Antara of Stockholm-based International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance (IDEA). 

	When we arrive home, the steady flow of letters, supermarket ads, bills and newspapers, maybe even a postcard, are a familiar sight. These days, this pile of post is likely to contain a golden ticket to a recurrent event that sometimes gets easily forgotten. This little white, blue and yellow envelope, contains a voting card, and while this is not news to most Swedes, for new Swedish residents it is often a surprising, memorable moment, linked to the virtues of a democracy of their new home, all wrapped up in a letter.

	The cornerstone of democracy is undoubtedly voting. For those born and raised in a democracy, voting constitutes a natural right and responsibility. For those who've never lived in one, it's often an aspiration or a dream. At election time, Sweden stands out as one of the most inclusive countries in the world.

	Here, non-Swedish citizens have the right to both vote and stand as candidates in the regional and municipal elections (but not national elections) if they have legally resided in Sweden for a continuous period of three years. Citizens from other EU countries gain these rights as soon as they are registered in the Swedish population register. The result of this is a great impact politics on the local level. Research from International IDEA shows that in particular, the political participation of migrants and refugees in Sweden is important for (increasing) the quality of democracy.

	Today, approximately 50 countries around the world – ranging from Chile to South Korea, New Zealand and the Netherlands – allow migrants to participate in elections after a certain period of residence. Granting voting rights to migrants is often a controversial issue, given that voting is traditionally linked to citizenship. In the majority of host countries, only certain categories of voters, such as citizens from EU member states, are entitled to vote and usually only in local elections.

	Sweden stands out in that regard given that it has granted voting rights since the 70s to all migrants with three years of residency, regardless of their country of origin.

READ ALSO: How Sweden hopes to get more foreign-born residents voting

	Through these measures, Swedish authorities wanted to enhance the participation and political inclusion of migrants and raise the perception that their voice also mattered. Indeed, recent research by International IDEA has found that voting is an important means of integrating into a host society, educating migrants about their civic responsibilities and preparing future active citizens. It also provides migrants with incentives to learn more about the democratic norms of the host society and motivates them to strengthen their knowledge of the host country's political system.

	Ultimately, political rights can contribute to an increased feeling of belonging and acceptance. Thus, political rights should not only be seen as an end goal, or a reward for successful integration, but as a means in itself. As illustrated in International IDEA's Global State of Democracy report, host countries with inclusive migration policies such as Sweden, are more likely to have a higher quality of democracy, especially when it comes to the aspects of representative government and fundamental rights.

	Some Swedish institutions have taken concrete steps to link theory to practice. To ensure that all eligible voters are aware of the electoral process, migrant voters are targeted through the use of minority languages in voter information campaigns. For instance, in view of the upcoming elections, the Swedish Election Authority provides information on how to vote into 31 languages, including Arabic and Somali.

	Furthermore, any legal resident, including migrants, can join any Swedish political party of their choice, paying just a membership fee. Party membership can be requested through online forms or by visiting the nearest party office in the area. In certain cases, political parties have even adopted voluntary quotas for candidates with non-Nordic immigrant background, with the view to increasing internal diversity and addressing the issue of migrants' underrepresentation in political life.

	Ultimately democracy relies on people, citizens or residents to actively take part in the democratic processes. Whether it's through political party engagement, civil society involvement, debates, articles, manifestations or voting, we all have the responsibility to engage.

	The elections this Sunday are just one important way to contribute, and for many it can be a first important step to integration that started when they found that small, white, blue and yellow envelope waiting for them at home.

					07:44 CEST+02:00				",AFP,"Cricket is booming in Sweden, thanks to migrants","
Wooden bats and red balls are taking over Sweden's fields: cricket is booming in the Scandinavian country thanks to Afghan and Pakistani migrants who've found a way to reconnect with their roots. 

	In a country where ice hockey reigns supreme, cricket was barely seen here ten years ago. But it has exploded in popularity recently and now boasts 65 teams in towns across Sweden.

	""Three or four years ago, we had only 13 clubs in Sweden and the number of players was around 600 or 700,"" said Tariq Zuwak, chairman of the Swedish Cricket Federation.

	With four divisions, the federation now counts more than 2,000 players: half have acquired Swedish citizenship, the other half are still waiting. Just a handful of members were born in Sweden.

	With the visor of his cap shading his eyes from the sun, his face showing signs of exertion after a match, 18-year-old Saeed Ahmed is one of the recently arrived players.

	He began playing cricket as a young boy in his native Afghanistan. Arriving in Sweden in 2015 after a perilous and exhausting journey, signing up with a cricket team was a top priority.

	Ahmed hopes to improve his game even further. On this unusually hot spring day in central Stockholm, he needs just 30 minutes to prove to Under-19s coach David Williman that his hard work is paying off.

	""It was tough,"" admits Ahmed, originally from Jalalabad in eastern Nangarhar province.

	And no wonder: the young Afghan has just played against one of the best known cricket teams in the world: London's Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) which holds worldwide responsibility for the sport's rules, known as Laws.

	The MCC team is in Sweden to instruct players on the official rules of the game, played by millions of people, predominantly in Britain's former colonies in Asia.

	Facing off against the ""Real Madrid of cricket"", as the Swedes jokingly call MCC on the sidelines, they lose the game but have a blast nonetheless.

	The number of cricket teams in Sweden has more than quadrupled in just a few years, a rise attributed ""mainly to the global situation in recent years,"" Zuwak said.

	Sweden has registered around 400,000 asylum applications since 2012 -- with more than one in eight coming from Afghanistan. That represents one application for every 25 inhabitants in the Scandinavian country, a record in Europe. Sweden saw a peak of 162,000 asylum applications in 2015.

	As Sweden grappled with the massive influx, the cricket federation also found itself having to adapt, creating new teams across the country. It also created two new positions, including one dedicated solely to integrating new arrivals into Swedish society.

	Playing cricket is a way for the asylum seekers to clear their thoughts and forget the troubles that hang over them while their asylum applications are being processed.

	""The youngsters miss their families and are worried about their asylum process. But when they play cricket, there is nothing else on their mind than having fun,"" said federation chairman Zuwak.

	It's also a way to avoid being brutally cut off from their roots.

	""I've made friends here who also come from Afghanistan,"" said Ahmed, who plays for a team in the suburb of Huddinge, south of Stockholm. The youngster now hopes to take part in the qualifying matches in England in July and August for the Under-19 World Cup.

	Meanwhile, Sweden's national squad, coached since May by former Pakistan cricketer Mohammad Wasim, will this summer play for the second time in the qualifiers for the ICC World T20 -- a shorter and more spectacular version of traditional cricket -- with the hopes of playing against the world's best teams in Australia in 2020.

IN DEPTH: How is Sweden tackling its integration challenge?

					07:49 CEST+02:00				", The Local,"Fewer than 500 of 163,000 asylum seekers found jobs","
Of almost 163,000 people who applied for asylum in Sweden last year, less than 500 landed a job, according to a report by a Swedish public broadcaster. 

	Using figures from Sweden's employment agency Arbetsförmedlingen and migration authorities Migrationsverket, SVT reported on Tuesday that 494 asylum seekers who arrived in 2015 have managed to find a job to support themselves while waiting for their application to get processed.

	A person who arrives in Sweden with valid identification documents and has applied for asylum is normally allowed to work despite not yet having a work or residence permit, if Migrationsverket grants them an exception.

	Such an exception is called the 'at-und' and usually gets processed automatically, reported SVT. However, only a third of asylum seekers aged 20-64 were given one in a year when Sweden received an unprecedented number of asylum claims.

	“It was an incredible number of people applying for asylum in Sweden and so that we would be able to register all of them, we had to de-prioritize certain tasks, and that was the matter of jobs,” Migrationsverket officer Lisa Bergstrand told SVT.

	The centre-left Social Democrat-Green government wants to hand out mainly temporary residence permits in the next three years, which would step up the pressure on asylum seekers to find work. A permanent permit could be offered after the first expires, if the person is able to support themselves.

	But figures suggest that the gap between Swedes and foreign-born is likely to grow. In April, the unemployment rate among people born in Sweden was at its lowest since before the global financial crisis in 2008, falling to 4.7 percent. The equivalent among residents born abroad was 14.9 percent.

	Long waiting times for residence permits, today up to a year, makes the matter all the more pressing. But Arbetsförmedlingen has little means of supporting asylum seekers looking for work.

	“They may be registered in our database as unemployed, but they are only entitled to basic services, that is using our online services and talking to advisers. But there are no programme-based alternatives, that is no courses and no traineeships,” Fredrik Möller, integration officer at Arbetsförmedlingen, told SVT.

	Meanwhile, other initiatives are slowly emerging in Sweden. Earlier this month The Local wrote about Sana Abdullah, 30, an IT engineer who got a job after only seven months in Sweden through Sync Accelerator, a recruitment agency helping startups connect with asylum seekers. 

	“There are a lot of people coming from Syria who are very talented and have a lot of experience especially in the field of IT. It's good to use these qualifications and it will benefit Sweden too. I know a lot of people who want to work, not just learn the language,” she told The Local at the time.

					13:02 CET+01:00				",AFP/The Local,'Stop deporting skilled migrants!' Swedish CEOs say,"
A group of CEOs representing some of Sweden's most prominent companies, including retail giant H&M and telecom equipment maker Ericsson, on Friday slammed the country for deporting a number of highly-skilled workers. 

In a letter published by the financial daily Dagens Industri and signed by around 30 bosses – including H&M CEO Stefan Persson and Ericsson chief executive Börje Ekholm – they write that expulsions of foreign employees ""harm business"" and that ""Swedish companies need to hire globally"".

	""We cannot expect engineers, IT-technicians, and other specialists to leave their countries if they risk expulsion from Sweden for unpredictable reasons,"" they added.

	The migration agency has faced criticism for refusing to extend foreign employees' work permits, leading to expulsion, on controversial grounds.

	Hussein Ismail, a Lebanese engineer at a biotech company that he founded in 2012, is facing deportation along with his wife and children after cutting his own wage for three months in 2015 to help his company survive.

READ ALSO: Why is Sweden deporting its foreign professionals?

	Sweden's strict laws against social dumping stipulate that if a foreign worker receives a salary below a collective agreement, then that employee must be sent back to the country of origin.

	In other cases, the migration agency decided to deport a foreign worker who failed to take the required amount of holiday and because of an administrative error made by an employer.

	The migration agency doesn't comment publicly on individual cases but insists on the respect for the Swedish rule of law when it sends a deportation order.

	Jenny Lindén Urnes, head of a group specializing in steel coatings, said the expulsions are ""an absurd soap opera"" that ""weakens Sweden's competitiveness"".

	And Ericsson CEO Ekholm warned in the letter that if the company ""wants to keep its research activities in Sweden, then economic immigration must operate in a transparent and predictable way"".

Job shortages and unemployed foreigners

	Such complaints may have been heard. In December, the Migration Court of Appeal handed down a ruling aimed at introducing more flexibility in handling the cases.

	""This is still insufficient, put an end to these tragedies and do it now,"" the bosses said in the letter.

	According to Johan Attby, founder of the social network Fishbrain, Stockholm will have to find 60,000 IT professionals by 2020 or risk losing its status as a hub for startups.

	""We have a continued broad job growth and a widespread labour shortage in several professions,"" Annelie Almérus, analyst at the Swedish Public Employment service, said in a report.

	""This provides good job opportunities within a record amount of professions,"" she added.

	The need for engineers, teachers and nurses in Sweden are evident.

	Sweden has received 400,000 asylum applications since 2012, a record per capita in Europe.

	This boost to its ageing population will only bear fruit in the long run: many applicants are still in school and others lack the required skills and qualifications.

	""You need at least a high-school degree to get a long-term establishment in the job market,"" Almérus said.

	Foreign-born residents are five times as likely (20 percent) to be unemployed as those born in the Nordic nation, according to the Statistics Sweden authority.

	The unemployment average was 6.5 percent in January, according to new figures presented by Statistics Sweden on Friday. Starting from May, Sweden's centre-left minority government is to expand subsidized entry-level jobs, a move demanded by employers.

					15:37 CEST+02:00				", The Local,"Debunk: No, Sweden isn't cancelling a Christmas concert because of migrants","
Several international far-right websites claimed that a Swedish Christmas concert had been cancelled in order to avoid offending Muslim migrants. In fact, the cause was a delay on budget and logistics planning from the company behind the event. The Local explores how the story got misrepresented. 

	The O Helga Natt (Oh, Holy Night) event in Örebro, central Sweden, is the country's biggest open air Christmas concert. It has been held since 2001 and broadcast on TV for ten years, but won't be broadcast this year and it's unclear if it will be held at all.

	One extremist far-right website reported that the disruption to the event was ""likely"" to be an example of ""Swedish traditions being suppressed in order not to offend migrants who don't hold Christian beliefs"", without providing any evidence for this claim.

	The column was written under the name 'Emma R' and published on the alt-right website Voice of Europe, before spreading to other far-right sites including the Geller Report and on the alt-right Peter Sweden Twitter account.

	It cited SVT Nyheter Örebro, which published a short article last week about the decision not to broadcast the concert. The article stated that it was unclear whether the event itself would still take place, contrary to Voice of Europe's article which stated the concert had already been ""cancelled"".

	""TV4 is not broadcasting O Helga Natt this year,"" executive producer Karin Dofs confirmed to The Local in a written comment. ""Because it isn't certain that the concert will be staged, we cannot plan for a TV broadcast either.""

	""It is sad that we're losing such a great and long-standing Christmas tradition, but we hope to be able to show O Helga Natt next year again,"" Dofs added.

	""We deal with untrue news being spread by answering questions we get with transparency. The reason why we decided not to broadcast the event is that there are uncertainties about whether the event will actually take place. These uncertainties have nothing to do with the untruths that have appeared in various forums,"" she said, when asked how TV4 reacted to the false reports.

READ ALSO: How a minor traffic incident was reported as 'horror' by international media

	As for the uncertainty over whether the concert will take place, there are a few contributing factors, none of them apparently relating to religion. Firstly, it's important to note that the concert has not been cancelled by ""Sweden"", as stated on the far-right sites, but rather removed from the programming schedule of one TV channel, TV4. 

	In September, Örebrokompaniet – the marketing company for Örebro municipality – announced that it was withdrawing its offer to be a partner of the event and its support of 900,000 kronor. The reason given was that the company organizing the event, Ambitiös, had failed to put forward a detailed budget or event plan.

	""We are not able to wait any longer for information because we need to move on in our planning before Christmas. We are commissioned by the municipality of Örebro to conduct a larger event for Örebro residents over Christmas and so we need to have enough time to find ways to use these resources in another way. Therefore, we are now withdrawing the offer,"" Christer Wilén, CEO of Örebrokompaniet, said in a statement in late September, adding that it was up to Ambitiös, the event's organizers, to let residents know if the event would go ahead. The Local has contacted Wilén for comment.

	Ambitiös took over organization of O Helga Natt after the company previously responsible went bankrupt in 2016, and was acquired by Ambitiös. Davor Dundic, CEO and owner of the latter company, said the strong brand and popularity of O Helga Natt was one of the main reasons for the acquisition, and Dundic was earlier this year nominated for an award as 'Örebro resident of the year' for his role in rescuing the free concert.

	When The Local contacted Ambitiös, we were told no one in the office was available to speak about O Helga Natt and to send an email, which at the time of publication had not received a response. The website for the concert has not been updated since February 2018, and still lists the details for the 2017 event, while several long-term past collaborators, including a producer and director, told SVT that they have also been unable to find up-to-date information on the event's status.

Last year's concert

	In its headline, Voice of Europe wrote: ""Sweden cancels traditional Christmas concert and increases promotions for Islamic events"", implying that funds and time slots set aside for traditional Christmas festivities were being diverted to Islamic cultural events. In fact, Örebrokompaniet has said it still plans to spend the money it had allocated to O Helga Natt on another large-scale Christmas event for the community.

	The Netherlands-based website describes itself as a ""conservative news network"" but most articles have a strong anti-migrant and anti-Islam bias. 

	The article about O Helga Natt concluded with a statement calling on readers to ""start speaking up and to stop accepting the destruction of our culture, counties (sic) and continent NOW"", in a thinly veiled attempt to appeal to far-right, anti-immigration or anti-Muslim sympathizers.

	Journalism professor Christian Christensen highlighted the impact of presenting biased takes on news in order to appeal to certain groups in a tweet:



			Now, which headline will get clicks....?

			“SWEDEN CANCELS CHRISTMAS CONCERT TO APPEASE ISLAMISTS”

			vs.

			“Organizers of one local Christmas concert fail to provide city with budget, calling event into question”
		— Christian Christensen (@ChrChristensen) October 16, 2018



	It's not the first time that Sweden's local Christmas festivities have been falsely reported abroad.

	In 2016, extremist fake news rights reported that the Scandinavian country had issued a ban on Christmas lights for religious reasons and particularly to avoid offending Muslims. The reports came as a surprise to anyone who was actually in Christmas for the festive season, where cities and towns were covered, as usual, in sparkly lights and other festive decorations.

	As with the O Helga Natt reports, that story started with a grain of truth. Transport administration Trafikverket had announced that councils wishing to hang lights on state-owned lampposts had to apply for permission, both for legal and health safety reasons.

Sweden's parliament passed a bill on Thursday giving thousands of young asylum seekers a second chance to stay until they complete high school, after the overwhelmed migration agency failed to process their applications before they became adults. 

	The decision will allow thousands of asylum seekers who were minors when they arrived in Sweden to re-apply for temporary residency. Asylum rules are more favourable for minors.

	Because asylum applications can take more than a year on average to process in Sweden, which has taken in more migrants per capita than any other country in Europe, some applicants turn 18 by the time their application is considered.

	""We need to take political responsibility. (Asylum seekers) should not be affected because the Swedish authorities haven't managed to process their application on time,"" Maria Ferm, a lawmaker for the Greens, told TT news agency.

	Passed with 166 votes against 134 with 48 abstentions, the bill was backed by the minority Social Democrats and Greens government and the Centre party while widely opposed by the conservative Moderates and the far-right Sweden Democrats.

	The move exposed a rift within the centre-right Alliance before the September 9th general election in which security and immigration are the two main themes.

	""The humane consequences of stopping the proposal would be far too grave,"" Annie Loof, leader of the opposition Centre Party, said in a Facebook post.

	The law will enter into force on July 1st. To be considered for temporary residency, asylum seekers must re-apply by the end of September. And it is only valid for those who initially applied no later than November 24th, 2015, when Sweden tightened its asylum rules to deter migrants from travelling to Sweden.

	In 2016, the Nordic nation announced it would only grant temporary three-year residence permits and limit  the number of refugees who would be allowed to join family members already settled in the country.

	The move was heavily criticized by human rights campaigners.

	The Scandinavian country has registered 400,000 asylum applications since 2012 -- or one for every 25 inhabitants, a record in Europe -- with a peak of 162,000 applications in 2015.

The number of EU migrants living in Sweden and believed to be begging on the country’s streets has more than doubled since last year, to around 4000 people, a new survey suggests. 

	From Vellinge in southern Sweden to Kiruna in the far north, there are now begging EU migrants, mostly from Romania and Bulgaria, across the country.

	According to a survey by Swedish broadcaster SVT, a total of 3,400 to 4,100 were living in Sweden just after Easter. This compares with an estimated 800 to 2,000 reported in a similar study a year ago.

	241 of Sweden’s 290 municipalities responded to a questionnaire sent out by the news network, which suggests that the total number of estimated migrants could be even higher if it were to include responses from the missing regions.

	Martin Valfridsson, Sweden's debut national coordinator for vulnerable EU citizens, who started in the freshly-created post in February, told the broadcaster that its figure sounded “accurate” based on his experiences.

	He has spent the past few weeks meeting municipalities and charities around the country as part of his efforts to better coordinate cooperation between the different groups that are currently providing aid and assistance to poor EU migrants.

	SVT's study suggested that there were now beggars in at least 40 municipalities where there were no migrants from Romania or Bulgaria a year ago, including Arvidsjaur in northern Sweden and Saffle Värmland.

	Sweden's long-term vision is to cut the number of beggars moving to the Nordic nation, while assisting those who have already made the journey. 

	""Beggars cannot uphold the same level of welfare as those who are resident in Sweden, but we should seek to use the resources we have here in the most efficient way to help them as much as possible,"" Valfridsson told The Local earlier this year.

	Most of the beggars are members of the Roma community - one of the EU's largest minority groups - and arrive as EU tourists under the right to Freedom of Movement. Many live in tents or caravans and make a living by asking Swedes for money outside shops and underground stations.

	Sweden and Romania have said they will cooperate and work against fighting poverty within the Roma community, following key talks between ministers from both countries in the Swedish capital earlier in January.

	 

	""Local authorities in Romania and Sweden will cooperate and we will prepare projects to achieve common goals for employment and social welfare in both our countries,"" promised Rovana Plumb, who is Minister for Labour, Family, Social Protection and the Elderly in Romania.

Sweden's Finance Minister said in a newspaper interview that it is time for the country to revisit labour migration policy, and that it should be much tougher for non-EU migrants to move to Sweden for unskilled jobs. 

	""Considering we have lots of new arrivals who need to enter the job market, I don’t see any need for cleaning staff or dish-washers from other continents as labour migrants,"" Finance Minister Magdalena Andersson told Svenska Dagbladet in an interview ahead of Monday’s presentation of the spring budget.

	""Within the areas where Sweden needs skills; doctors for example, or data engineers, there should be good possibilities for labour migration,” the minister said. ""On the other hand, I find it hard to see why we should have the most generous rules in the OECD for unskilled labour migration.""

	Last year, around 15,500 people from non-EU countries received work permits in Sweden. Almost a third of those moved for jobs which required less than tertiary level education, data from the Swedish Migration Agency shows.

	In the first three months of 2018, around one in seven of the work permits granted fell into this category.

	Sweden's existing rules on labour migration, put together by the centre-right Alliance and the Green Party in 2008, state that it falls to employers to determine whether they need foreign workers to fill jobs. Previously this had been decided by assessments of labour shortages from the Swedish Employment Agency and unions.

	Prime Minister Stefan Löfven, who like Andersson is a Social Democrat, has also called for changes to the labour migration rules, saying in a speech last February that jobs requiring little or no education should be filled first and foremost by unemployed people already in Sweden. He echoed this sentiment last week, stating: ""It is unreasonable that thousands of people come to Sweden each year to do jobs that unemployed people in Sweden could do.""

	Although Sweden's unemployment rate is relatively low at 6.2 percent, this is higher than targets set by the government and a long way off Sweden's ambitious goal of achieving the EU's lowest unemployment rate by 2020.

	Both politicians faced criticism from Sweden's other major parties, with Jonas Sjöstedt, the leader of the Left Party, comparing Löfven's comments to the rhetoric of the far-right Sweden Democrats.

	And in response to Andersson's interview, Annie Lööf, who leads the Centre Party, said the Social Democrats ""should be ashamed of the image they're spreading of labour migration which Sweden and Swedish businesses so badly need"".

EU leaders on Friday night approved a controversial deal with Turkey to curb the huge flow of asylum seekers to Europe, with all migrants arriving in Greece from Sunday to be sent back. 

	Finland's Prime Minister Juha Sipila said the 28 EU leaders approved Friday the deal negotiated with Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu in a bid to end an unprecedented crisis dividing the continent.

	""The Turkey deal was approved,"" Sipila wrote on Twitter.

	Czech Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka confirmed that the expulsion of migrants arriving on the Greek islands would begin on Sunday.

	""Deal with Turkey approved. All illegal migrants who reach Greece from Turkey as of March 20 will be returned!"" Sobotka wrote on Twitter.

	More than 1.2 million migrants have come to Europe since January 2015 in the continent's biggest migration crisis since World War II, and around 4,000 have drowned while trying to cross the Aegean Sea between Turkey and Greece.

	But the deal comes at a heavy cost for Europe, with many members of the bloc expressing misgivings about the legality of the deal and Turkey's human rights record.

	Turkey has demanded an acceleration of its long-stalled bid for EU membership, the doubling of refugee aid to €6bn ($6.8 billion) and visa-free travel in return for taking back all new irregular migrants coming to Greece, the main entry point to Europe.

	Davutoglu is now set to formally sign off on the accord at a final meeting with EU leaders.

	""Tusk's proposal for the EU-Turkey agreement approved by EU leaders, in principle, as it is now up for final talks with the Turkish prime minister,"" a senior EU official told AFP.

	But in a sign of the tensions that remain between Ankara and Brussels, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan blasted several EU states for taking only a ""handful of refugees"" in contrast to the nearly three million Turkey has admitted, most of them fleeing the Syrian war.

	Erdogan also accused the Europeans of supporting the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) days after a bombing in Ankara claimed by Kurdish rebels allegedly linked to the group.

	""European countries are paying no attention, as if they are dancing in a minefield,"" he said.

	Critics have said the mass expulsion planned under the EU-Turkey deal could infringe international law on the treatment of asylum seekers.

	Under the terms of the plan, the EU would take in one Syrian refugee from Turkish soil in exchange for every Syrian readmitted to Turkey from Greece.

	The move is meant to discourage them from risking their lives in often rickety and overcrowded boats operated by smugglers.

	EU officials insisted the deal would be stressed repeatedly each application would be treated individually, with full rights of appeal and proper oversight.

	EU sources said last-minute sticking points were cleared up over the deal's legality, Turkey's membership bid, the date for launching the agreement and a plan to double the amount of aid to Turkey.

	Another major hurdle that was overcome was opposition from Cyprus, rooted in long-standing tensions with Turkey over Ankara's refusal to recognise its government on the divided island.

	Many European Union states have expressed concerns about Ankara's human rights record, including its treatment of the Kurds and a crackdown on critics of the government.

	The United Nations and rights groups fear the deal could violate international law that forbids the mass deportation of refugees.

	Amnesty International set up a sign outside the summit venue: ""Don't trade refugees"".

	The crisis has left Europe increasingly divided, with fears that its Schengen passport-free zone could collapse as states reintroduce border controls and concerns over the rise of populism and anti-immigrant sentiment.

	The deal also envisages major aid for Greece, where tens of thousands of refugees are trapped in dire conditions after Balkan countries shut their borders to stop them heading north to richer Germany and Scandinavia.

	The agreement does not however affect the more than 46,000 refugees and migrants already in Greece.

	Greek Interior Minister Panagiotis Kouroublis described the overwhelmed border town of Idomeni where many of the migrants are camped out as a ""modern-day Dachau"".

	British Prime Minister David Cameron was also hosting a meeting with Merkel and several other EU leaders on how to tackle migration flows from lawless Libya, which appeared to be increasing again.

					12:39 CET+01:00				", The Local,Impact of Sweden's asylum age assessment tests revealed,"
The results of medical age assessments on asylum seekers who arrived in Sweden as unaccompanied minors show that many were older than they claimed. 

	The national forensic medicine agency (Rättsmedicinalverket) began carrying out the checks earlier this year after doubts were raised over whether all those who were being processed as minors were in fact underage.

	The Migration Agency has so far made 5,700 decisions on the basis of assessments carried out by Rättsmedicinalverket. In 79 percent of those cases the agency decided to formally consider the applicant as older than they had initially claimed in their asylum application, reports Svenska Dagbladet (SvD).

	Between mid-March and late October, Rättsmedicinalverket carried out a total of 7,858 age assessments. Of those, it found that their examination suggested 6,628 were 18 or older, and 112 ""possibly"" 18 or older.

	However, in 1,077 cases, Rättsmedicinalverket found that the applicant was possibly younger than 18. SvD reports that 430 of these had stated they were adults when they first applied for asylum in Sweden.

	“In these cases, we judged that the asylum seekers were in fact underage, in contradiction with the information they themselves provided,” Daniel Salehi from the Swedish Migration Agency told SvD.

	When the Migration Agency assessed asylum seekers' ages last year, before it was handed over to Rättsmedicinalverket, it formally increased the age of 17 percent of those whose age was in doubt.

	It is unclear why the figure has increased so sharply, said Salehi. ""One reasonable explanation could be that the cases are now quite simply older, after one or one-and-a-half years,"" he told SvD.

	The method of medical age assessment consists of taking X-rays of wisdom teeth, and MRI scans of knee joints, which are then analyzed by dentists and radiologists.

	The first results of the new age assessments came in May this year, and in those tests -- which were carried out on asylum seekers whose age was in question -- three out of four were found to be older than 18.

	However, there has been controversy over the accuracy of these tests and the Rättsmedicinalverket has previously emphasized that no method of medical age assessment can determine a precise age.

	The results of these checks don't give a picture of how accurate the given age of all asylum seekers in Sweden is, as the checks have only been carried out in cases where there was reason to doubt the person's given age.

READ ALSO: Support provided to refugee children in Sweden inadequate: report

	There are several reasons why the age of those who arrive in Sweden might be unclear. Many of the asylum seekers who have arrived in Sweden in the past few years lack identity documents, with many coming from unstable regions where they may have lost many of their belongings. Another factor is that their countries of origin often do not have the same structures in place to record birthdates as Sweden does, so it's not unusual for people not to know their exact age. 

	This can cause problems because there are differences in how adults and unaccompanied minors are processed; for example, the latter may only be returned to their home countries if they have a family member or other guardian who can provide them with somewhere to live.

	The Migration Agency makes an initial age assessment with every application, and people who are not clearly aged over 18 are registered as children.

	However, these tests were criticized as ineffective and several Swedish municipalities reported suspected cases of adults who could be as old as 40 being placed together with children at residential care homes for young people (known as HVB homes), as well as being sent to school with minors.

	As a result, in September last year the government asked for medical age assessments to be carried out on a large scale.

	More than 80,000 minors (of whom 37,000 arrived in the country without a parent or guardian) applied for asylum in Sweden in 2015 and 2016. Medical age assessments are carried out only in cases where the Migration Agency believes there is reason to doubt their age.

					11:05 CEST+02:00				",Lee Roden,'Tide turning' on Sweden's attitude to immigration: report,"
Sweden's progressive attitude towards immigration is changing, according to a new report on racism and migration in the EU. 

	NGO network the European Network Against Racism (ENAR) carried out a report on racism and discrimination in the context of migration across 26 EU countries, and when it comes to Sweden, researchers concluded that while the country appears to be more progressive than other EU nations on immigration, the tide is turning.

	The report highlights examples of attacks on migrants, anti-migrant discourse, and far-right vigilante activity in Sweden.

	""In terms of immigration and integration policies it appears that Sweden is more progressive than other countries, but the tide is also turning. A number of restrictions to existing migration and integration policies have been introduced, and the media discourse has shifted from positive welcoming of refugees and asylum seekers to portraying migration, and by extension, migrants, as a problem,"" ENAR press spokesperson Georgina Siklossy told The Local.

	""This also has an impact on people who have lived in Sweden for two or three generations and continue to be regarded as 'alien elements',"" she added.

	Citing figures recorded by the Kantor Center, the report notes that 43 arson attacks against asylum seeker accommodation occurred in Sweden in 2015, while in 2016 a group of black-clad masked men assaulted people who looked 'foreign' in Stockholm.

READ ALSO: New stats on asylum homes torched in Sweden in 2016

	Those attacks are likely linked to wider anti-migrant debates in Sweden, according to Siklossy:

	""Violence against migrants is fuelled by hateful anti-migrant discourse, although it is complex and difficult to prove a direct correlation between the two. Nevertheless, civil society organizations across Europe report that such discourse legitimises violent attacks, emboldens people with racist views to take action, and contributes to an overall climate of hostility towards migrants.""

	""The perpetrators of such attacks are hard to determine, although several are involved in far-right groups or movements, and it's clear far-right groups and parties play a role in opposition to asylum centres in this instance, distributing leaflets and mobilizing their supporters,"" the ENAR spokesperson added.

	ENAR's report observes that far-right groups have been successful in setting the tone on migration, and that media outlets ""conflate the Muslim community with issues of terrorism and security"".

	One person the organization interviewed said they felt that in Sweden ""the media image around migrants basically means a Muslim, and that coverage about Muslims – in this case people who fled or have come here because of conflicts – are associated with what has become known as extremism"".

	Sweden is also one of several EU Member States where ""the narrative purports that 'white' European women must be protected from predatory migrant Muslim men,"" ENAR's study adds.

Anti-Roma adverts launched by the Sweden Democrats (SD) in the Stockholm subway in 2015 meanwhile make it ""as obvious as possible that certain migrants are not welcome"" and normalize racism against Roma people.

	The adverts sparked strong reactions however, and ""individuals as well as organizations"" condemned them, ENAR elaborates, but it is difficult to judge what proportion of the Swedish population is against the sentiments according to Siklossy:

	""The research doesn't go more deeply into this aspect. Of course it's very positive that there was public condemnation of the advertising, but it is difficult to include from that instance that the vast majority of Swedes are against such sentiments, notably in the context of increasing support for SD in the 2014 elections.""

READ ALSO: Stir over anti-begging ad for tourists in Stockholm

	In its conclusion, the report argues that across the EU there have been few specific efforts made to combat discrimination through legislative measures, while in contrast there are many examples of increasingly restrictive policies.

	Most of the focus is on security and return measures, ENAR believes, while more attention needs to be given to two-way integration instead.

	""There is no such thing as homogeneous nation-states in Europe but until this is understood more clearly by EU Member Sates, anti-migrant sentiments and racism will continue,"" the study concludes.

					13:11 CET+01:00				",None,'Undocumented migrants are not the problem',"
Hunting down undocumented immigrants like animals is immoral and a waste of police resources, argues socialist weekly Arbetaren’s editor-in-chief Daniel Wiklander, who would like the Swedish companies who exploit vulnerable foreign-born workers to be held responsible. 
 
Swedish police are using ever more resources in the hunt for undocumented immigrants. But as it is illegal to stop a person without reasonable grounds for suspicion, the police are making up reasons. 
The end result is racial profiling, which is undignified for any country that respects the rule of law.
 
The project entitled Reva, which stands for Rättssäkert och effektivt verkställighetsarbete ('Legal and effective execution of policy'), uses rewritten methods to find and deport people who are in Sweden without permission.
 
Reva exemplifies how a state authority can come up with new methods to reach its goals without technically violating the letter of the law.
 
The police have raided the street market on Möllevångstorget square in Malmö alongside officials from the Tax Authority (Skatteverket), for example, or stopped people cycling through the city for traffic violations – but in actual fact, the aim has been to check people’s identification documents.
 
There are cases of the police breaking up weddings with pepper spray to get at undocumented immigrants. They have arrested teenagers out on leave from psychiatric care, which they were receiving in the first place because they were so terrified of being deported that it affected their mental health.
 
Reva is a success in as far as it has done what it set out to do. 
Deportations are up by 25 percent. The pilot project was followed by a national rollout – and all this is taking place with the EU’s support. 
Reva gets funding from the European Return Fund, which the union set up within the €676-million ($890 million) budget programme “Solidarity and Management of Migration Flows”.
Since January, Reva has been tried out in Stockholm, which has become all the more obvious these last few weeks for those of us who live here. Instead of targeting cyclists, the police are targeting commuters in the city’s public transit system.
 
Citizens have reacted by plotting their whereabouts – either on the Facebook page Reva Spotter but also on Twitter.
 
The main tactic is to target people who are jumping the turnstiles without paying for a ticket, which gives the police the opportunity to check people’s ID documents and residency permits.
 
Of course, it would be much easier for the police to simply stop anyone who looked like they weren’t European – but that is not allowed.
”We have to have a reason to check ID documents and residency permits,” a Stockholm police officer told our newspaper Arbetaren in December.
 
Well, yes, of course they do, because what would we end up with if they didn’t need a reason? 
We’d end up with a police state.
 
The fact is – the police are engaging in a type of racial profiling, even though they use other qualifiers like jumping the turnstiles in Stockholm or cycling in Malmö with a broken headlight to stop people.
What we have on our hands is a superb example of creative police work – how to figure out new methods to reach a specific goal without technically going against the letter of the law. 
Swedish police officers do not, like their British colleagues do, have the right to stop and search anyone they like without having any suspicion of crime. 
So Swedish police have to make up reasons.
That this is taking place in the context of a project that claims to respect the law is absurd. Furthermore, to pump resources into a crime as petty as jumping the turnstiles is an abuse of police powers, which in the long run risks damaging the respect that people feel for democracy.
It does not respect the law.
Police work is all about prioritizing. A person with power has decided that hunting down undocumented immigrants should be top priority right now. As a Swedish citizen I have to ask – in what way does the presence of undocumented immigrants in the country pose a problem for me?
For the undocumented immigrant, however, there are big problems in living and working in Sweden without a permit. 
Apart from the constant fear of arrest and deportation, they have to navigate many things that the rest of us take for granted – healthcare and education, for example.
Simple things like buying a train ticket – ironically, this also applies to a one-way ticket on the Stockholm metro – cannot be done today without possessing a personal identification number (personnummer).
Undocumented immigrants work under the table for pitiful salaries and without any employment security. If they complain, the employer can easily have them kicked out of the country.
If we need to prioritize, why aren’t we targeting the employers who let undocumented immigrants slave away in restaurant kitchens or work for nothing as cleaners?
Why aren't we targeting the people in Sweden who make money off undocumented immigrants shovelling snow off the rooftops wearing nothing on their feet but trainers?
Why aren't we targeting the people in Sweden who rope in undocumented immigrants to demolish houses riddled with asbestos without offering them proper protective gear?
Many work for subcontractors. It is the big Swedish companies who don’t keep an eye on their subcontractors who carry much of the responsibility for this abuse.
The undocumented migrants are not the problem. The companies that exploit them are. 
Undocumented workers are also workers, but with worse working conditions, lower salaries and less security than anyone else in our country. 
That we let this happen and that we through our parliamentary system have told the police to hunt them down like animals is not just a waste of resources but deeply shameful.

		""Asylum seekers have a fundamental right to have their individual asylum claims reviewed in a safe country. Under this agreement there is a genuine risk that people will be denied the right to an individual assessment because it treats all refugees under a mass agreement,"" Louise Gunvén, lawyer and board member of Lawyers Without Borders told Swedish news agency, TT.



		Asylum law prohibits return to a country that is unsafe, where people risk being subjected to inhumane or degrading treatment or torture.

		""Our extensive experience of Turkey is that people risk being exposed to such treatment. Considerable failings exist in the Turkish legal system, as well as the risk of not getting a fair trial,"" Gunvén said.

		The deal also drew criticism from John Dalhuisen, Amnesty International's Director for Europe and Central Asia, who said promises by the EU to respect international and European law ""appear suspiciously like sugar-coating the cyanide pill that refugee protection in Europe has just been forced to swallow"".

	The migrants are believed to have been at sea for between 12 and 24 hours but officials said that they appeared to be in relatively good health.

	Mattias Lindholm, a press officer for the Swedish coast guard told the TT news agency that  the rescue mission had been “calm and collected” and that those with immediately obvious minor injuries had been quickly treated.

Poseidon's mission is to save the lives of migrants trying to get to Europe. It arrived in the Mediterranean earlier this month as part of operation Triton, the EU's border rescue operation. 

	In an interview with Swedish Radio ahead of the mission, commander Peo Allard said that the Swedes on board Poseidon had never undertaken a task quite like this one, which had involved both specific training and mental preparation.

	“They received information on why people are driven to flee,” he said.

	“The most difficult challenge will be meeting these overcrowded boats,” he added. “It’s a completely new kind of assignment for us, but something I have no doubt we can manage.”

	The Poseidon is kitted out with special equipment in order to take on a large number of migrants. The ship has portable toilets and private rooms for women and children. Sails have been put up to create shade for protection from the heat.

	The ship has rescued around 1,650 migrants since it arrived in the Mediterranean.

The party secretary of the Sweden Democrats has suggested that migrants should be given a cash incentive to leave Sweden and suggested that minority groups needed to ""assimilate"" more to be considered true Swedes.  
  ""It would be good with a repatriation grant,"" Björn Söder said in a lengthy interview with Dagens Nyheter.   When asked specifically if migrants in the southern city of Malmö should be given money to return home he stated that he was not against the idea.   ""Yes, and that is good. We must make it easier for those considering moving back to their own country. Then we'll be in a better condition to create a society of common identity.""   Elsewhere in the interview Söder mentioned Jews, Kurds and Sami people as examples of groups that may have Swedish citizenship but ,in his view, can't be considered true Swedes if they don't ""assimilate"" into Swedish society.   ""We are for an inclusive society where everybody who wants to can fit in. We have an open Swedishness which also includes people with foreign roots. But you have to adapt to the Swedish and assimilate in order to become Swedish,"" said Söder.   He added; ""I think that most people with Jewish origin who have become Swedes leave their Jewish identity behind. But if they don't it doesn't have to be an issue.   ""You have to differentiate between citizenship and national affiliation. They can still be Swedish citizens and live in Sweden. Sami and Jews have lived in Sweden for a long time,"" he said. 
  His remarks have not gone down well with the chairperson of the Swedish committee against anti-Semitism, Willy Silberstein.   ""I am Jewish and born in Sweden.

The Swedish justice and migration minister, Morgan Johansson, has accused David Cameron of ""playing politics"" with the migrant crisis in Calais. 

	The situation in Calais showed ""a system that is breaking down"", he told BBC Radio 4's World This Weekend, adding: ""I see a country who don't want to take the responsibility that they should”.

	Migrants in Calais are making nightly bids to cross the Channel.

	The UK and French governments have announced they will bolster security around the Eurotunnel site in Calais.

	Mr Johansson was critical of Mr Cameron's rhetoric: ""I hear what he is saying about 'illegal immigrants' and 'swarms' and I think he is trying to divide people, that that is not a constructive way.""

	Speaking to BBC Radio 4's The World This Weekend programme, Mr Johansson criticised Mr Cameron for using the word ""illegal"" about asylum seekers before they have been through asylum the process, and said they were seeking a basic human right.

	Sweden was currently accepting around 1,000-1,200 asylum applicants a week, Johansson said.

	Since 2013, Sweden has thrown its doors open to Syrians, granting them near automatic residency and boosting overall asylum applications -- the highest per capita in the EU according to Eurostat -- to record levels.

	Last year Sweden accepted 30,000 asylum seekers compared to the UK's 10,000.

	Thousands of migrants have attempted to access the Eurotunnel terminal in the last week, and nine have died trying to access the tunnel since the start of June.

Plans to force wealthy European nations such as the UK to take in more refugees have been backed by Sweden, which currently takes in more asylum seekers per capita than any other EU nation. 

	Proposals to ensure a more balanced spread of refugees across the EU are expected to be put forward by the European Commission in Brussels on Wednesday, alongside plans to increase legal means for migrants to travel to Europe.

	The move, first reported in Britain’s The Times newspaper on Monday, aims to create legislation that would force all 28 member states to share responsibility for “mass influxes” of non-EU migrants during times of emergency.

	Sweden’s Justice and Migration Minister Morgan Johansson has told The Local that he is “looking forward” to seeing the full Commission Agenda on the issue, and said media reports already suggest the EU’s policy-making body is “on the right track” at a time when “it is clear we have to improve the responsibility sharing within the Union”.

	Sweden dealt with more than 81,410 asylum cases between March 2014 and March 2015, while Germany processed the greatest number in the EU: 247,635. By contrast, the UK dealt with 29,340, while the figure for Netherlands was 23,780. 

	“Our Common European Asylum System is not very common in a situation where a handful of Member States are taking the responsibility for over 90 percent of the asylum seekers,” he said late on Monday.

	“For the Common European Asylum System to be sustainable in the long run, a more even distribution of asylum seekers within the EU is needed.”

	Italy and Austria are among the other member states backing the proposals, while a spokesperson for the UK Home Office told The Times that Prime Minister David Cameron’s new Conservative government “will oppose any EU proposals to introduce a non-voluntary quota”.

	“Mad and unfair” was the description Hungary’s Prime Minister Viktor Orban gave to the plan.

	Germany is strongly in favour of the idea, having long pushed for quotas, while France’s Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve also came out in support of the proposals on Monday.

	“I think it is normal to share out the asylum claimants,” he said.

	Under the reported proposals, the number of refugees sent to each EU country would in future be determined according to a formula which considers factors such as unemployment, economic performance, population size and the number of previous arrivals.

	It is estimated that more than 5000 migrants have died over the past year while making their way to Europe from war-torn nations such as Syria, Iraq and Libya, in packed boats travelling in dangerous conditions.

	Sweden’s Justice and Migration Minister Morgan Johansson told The Local that he also backed the Commission’s proposals to secure a safer passage to Europe for refugees.

	“The lack of regular channels to seek protection fuels smuggling,"" he said.

	“Therefore we need to see a substantial increase in the use of resettlement on an EU-level. Sweden also wants the EU Commission to investigate other realistic possibilities for people to seek protection in the EU.”

	In the meantime, Sweden is continuing to prepare itself for new arrivals. 

Fifteen thousand more asylum places are expected to be needed in the Nordic country this year. To cope with an increasing flow of refugees, the Swedish Migration Board announced in March that it has more than tripled the maximum number of residents allowed at each asylum centre in the nation from 200 to 650.

	EU leaders are set to discuss the quota proposals in Brussels when they meet on June 25th.

					06:59 CEST+02:00				", The Local,Refugees welcome? How UK and Sweden compare on education for young migrants,"
OPINION: The UK should learn from Sweden when it comes to educating young immigrants, argues Nottingham University's Joanna McIntyre in this opinion piece first published by The Conversation. 

	In the UK, the world’s fifth richest economy, vulnerable children are being denied education. Asylum seekers and refugee children are struggling to access education – and unable to attend school or college. This contravenes rights to equal educational access in accordance with international human rights law.

	I’m currently working on research projects about child refugees, one of which compares experiences of children in the UK with those arriving in Sweden – and I am concerned that the UK education system is not currently fit for purpose or able to provide adequate schooling for every child.

	The fact of the matter is that refugee children should be resettled in the UK. It is quite simply the right thing to do for obvious humanitarian reasons. As Ghandi observed: ""The true measure of any society can be found in how it treats its most vulnerable members.""

	Lessons should be learned from countries such as Sweden, where more inclusive practices are already in place. It should also be considered how education policies and practices are working against schools and teachers who want to welcome refugees but who are unable to.

Hassan's story

	Take Hassan, he’s 15 and Iranian, and I met him at an arts workshop for recently arrived child refugees in the UK. Hassan had been in the UK for four months and did not yet have a school place.

	His age is the first barrier when it comes to an education. This is because Hassan should be in year 11 – GCSE year – which means a school could be reluctant to take him because he is unlikely to have sufficient preparation time for exams.

	Teachers are also under massive amounts of pressure to deliver outcomes to boost their school’s progress scores and performance in league tables. And new arrivals such as Hassan – regardless of their prior attainment and experience – are unlikely to be able to adjust to the English school culture and absorb the content and skills required to pass high stakes examinations in the remaining months of year 11.

	The second barrier is language. When we met, Hassan had a friend translating. And until he has a school place, Hassan will be reliant on the support of volunteer groups for English language lessons.

	There is another practical barrier, too – Hassan had a letter from his local authority (which he carries with him) saying there are three potential schools for him. But none are near Hassan’s home, and two of the schools are two bus rides away.

Navigating the system

	If Hassan isn’t successful in finding a school place in 40 days, his case will appear before what’s known as a Fair Access Panel. This will allocate a place to Hassan and there will be a further period of time when the school can appeal this decision.

	Should he find a place, the school, undoubtedly worried about balancing budgets and managing limited resources, will decide which class to put him in, which subjects, and which sets. He might also attend an intervention programme to develop his English and help him access the curriculum, but such places are limited.

	More likely, Hassan will be placed in a mainstream classroom and given in-house language support – which will mean withdrawal from some lessons. He will probably also be placed in lower sets because his English will mask his real ability.

	These decisions will have short, and maybe, longer term implications for Hassan’s prospects and for the friendship groups he develops.

The Swedish way

	But until Hassan gets a school place, he is stuck. He reached the UK but is unable to begin making a new life because he cannot access the support the education system should be able to offer him. And if this is still the case after the age of 16, his experiences are likely to be worse because places in post 16 provision are often even more limited.

	But had Hassan landed in Sweden, he and his family would access two hours daily of Swedish language tuition – as part of their residence permit. In school, Hassan would also receive two hours teaching per week in his home language.

	This reflects research which shows that when it comes to language learning, a bilingual environment is most successful. This means a child’s first language is continued to enable them to learn a second or third language more quickly.

	In Sweden, Hassan’s local school would also commit to enrol him as quickly as possible. Often within a fortnight of arriving in the country.

	Like Sweden, schools in the UK should also be inclusive spaces that offer education for all rather than just for league tables. This is important because young refugees are likely to complete their education in their new country – becoming full members of their “post-settlement” society.

So instead of restricting access to education, the UK should instead recognise the potential of these children and welcome them in its schools as they begin their new lives.

Thousands of tourists from Sweden and Denmark have been invited to donate to migrants arriving on Mediterranean islands by checking in an extra bag of unwanted clothes, but less than 30 are believed to have taken up the offer. 

	Nordic tour operators including Ving and Spies have emailed thousands of customers scheduled to take charter flights operated by Thomas Cook Airlines Scandinavia from Stockholm's Arlanda Airport and Copenhagen Airport since June.

	 

	The tourists have been offered the chance to pack a box or unwanted bag weighing up to 20 kilos, containing clothes, blankets or toys they no longer need. The idea is that their donations will then be passed on to some of the thousands of migrants crossing the Mediterranean sea and arriving on the Greek islands of Kos and Lesvos, which are also hotspots for holidaymakers.

	 

	But on Thursday a spokesperson for Ving told The Local that only ""less than 10 people"" from Sweden had taken the opportunity to make a donation over the past six weeks, despite the firm sending out 1500 messages to Swedish passengers.

	 

	Earlier in the week Danish newspaper BT suggested that around 20 passengers flying out of Copenhagen had put extra bags on to Thomas Cook flights and Ving said that ""about 20"" other people had booked to take extra luggage to Lesbos on a flight leaving the Danish capital on Sunday.

	 

	""We would really like to help,"" Magdalena Öhrn, Ving's press spokesperson said.

	 

	""We are just offering an opportunity to people and I am happy that 20 people have done it. Even a small help is a help,"" she added.

	 

	But Öhrn told The Local she hoped that ""many more people"" would get involved in the coming months, with the initiative scheduled to run until at least September.

	 

	""We have the aeroplanes and other people have things they do not need any more, so it is a good thing,"" she said.

	 

	Öhrn added that all donated bags would be thoroughly checked as usual to ensure there is no security risk to other passengers and said that customers' bags would be prioritized in the event of too much extra luggage filling the plane.

	 

	""If there are any problems the extra bags will just go on the next flight,"" she explained.

	 

	Kos and Lesvos have been inundated with refugees from Syria and Afghanistan in recent months, with thousands of people making dangerous journeys across the Mediterranean in order to reach the European Union.

	 

	The move represents a major shift in migration patterns with almost as many migrants now choosing Greece instead of Italy as their entry point to the EU, despite Greece's acute economic problems.

	 

	UN figures released in June suggested that more than 39,000 refugees arrived in Greece by sea during the first six months of 2015, compared with 45,000 who reached Italy.

Growing numbers of asylum seekers are trying to get to Sweden from Denmark by clinging to trucks, a ferry company has warned.  

	In a letter to its freight customers, HH Ferries said several migrants had been found hanging from the undersides of trucks in Helsingør in recent days in an apparent attempt to avoid ID checks. 

	The ferry operator’s CEO Henrik Rørbæk urged drivers to look out for any attempts to board ferries illegally. 

	“This is of course an unfortunate and potentially very dangerous situation that these people put themselves and others in,” he wrote in the letter, Danish news agency Ritzau reported. 

	The number of people trying to make their way from Denmark to Sweden by sea has risen in recent weeks, according to the Danish Shipowners’ Association. 

	“We’re seeing the same trend that we’ve seen in the English Channel,” the association’s director Jakob Ullegård told Ritzau. 

	“When vehicles stop on the road down to the ferry they sneak up under the trucks.” 

	Swedish police said earlier this week that they had received reports of people who had successfully entered the country on trucks. 

	Details were scarce but police said members of the pubic had seen migrants under a truck on the E6 motorway in Helsingborg, while others were seen leaving a truck at a nearby rest stop. 

	Sweden took in a record 160,000 asylum seekers in 2015 before introducing ID checks to stem the flow. 

	The influx put the country’s finances and housing under strain and Prime Minister Stefan Löfven faced a hearing at the parliamentary constitutional committee on Friday morning to answer questions about Sweden’s handling of the crisis. 

	Löfven argued that not even the migration agency had foreseen the dramatic rise in refugee arrivals that saw an average of 10,000 asylum seekers each week make their way to Sweden in the autumn. 

	Sweden put its agencies on crisis alert from August and the government took around 70 decisions designed to control the situation, Löfven said. 

	“Thanks to the work of the crisis organization, intensified information-gathering and flexible working structures the government was able in the autumn to take the necessary decisions to reduce the number of people seeking asylum in Sweden and relieve the acute pressure on the reception process,” he said. 

	The Prime Minister was summoned to the constitutional committee by politicians including Jessica Polfjärd from the centre-right Moderates who felt the government had handled the refugee crisis badly and let it get out of hand.

	""Since the government has ultimate responsibility for crisis management we think there are issues that need to be fully looked into so the Swedish people can be told why there were delays,"" Polfjärd told newspaper Dagens Nyheter when she reported the government to the constitutional committee in January.

					17:44 CEST+02:00				",TT/The Local,Sweden watches as EU migrant talks collapse,"
UPDATED: EU nations have failed to agree on how many of the refugees that have arrived in the Mediterranean this year should be taken in by each member state after months of wrangling. 

	Migration ministers from all 28 EU member states met on Monday in an attempt to finalize European Commission plans to resettle 40,000 refugees based in Italy and Greece and another 20,000 asylum seekers from outside of Europe.

	“All EU member states have to be prepared to take their responsibility. This is the worst humanitarian crisis in our time,” Sweden's migration minister Morgan Johansson told reporters when he arrived in Brussels.

	But after several hours of talks, the European Commission's plan to ask all EU member states to take in a proportion of the refugees remained in limbo as some nations asked for more time before committing to a set quota.

	Sweden, which already accepts the most asylum seekers per capita in the EU, offered ahead of the meeting to relocate just over 1,800 migrants as part of the scheme. Germany, which takes the greatest number of refugees in real terms, has signed up to 12,000.

	The Nordic country had advocated mandatory quotas, which would have seen countries allocated a set of asylum seekers based on their population size, economic growth and former engagement with refugees.

	But after several states voiced concerns about the strategy, including Hungary, Slovakia, Spain and Estonia, EU leaders agreed to make the quotas voluntary. The UK has chosen to avoid the plans entirely due to an existing EU agreement which allows it to ‘opt out’ of some issues.

	“In some member states there are extreme right-wing forces that push for an end to all commitments,” said Johansson ahead of the talks.

	“It's about creating a new order in Europe where you can't just assume that only some countries will take their responsibility,” he added.

	It is estimated that more than 1,800 migrants have died so far in 2015 while making their way to Europe from war-torn nations such as Syria, Iraq and Libya, in packed boats travelling in dangerous conditions.

	Sweden's foreign minister, Margot Wallström, recently told The Local: “What if we lived in a war zone? We would also want to flee somewhere safe with our children, or try to secure a future elsewhere. It has to do with whether or not we are serious in the EU about our guiding principles – this will affect our credibility.”

	But Sweden's open borders have been strongly criticised by opposition groups in recent months. The nationalist Sweden Democrats - backed by 12.9 percent of voters in the last general election - want the Nordic nation to limit immigration and several centre-right parties have mooted the idea of giving refugees temporary rather than permanent residency permits.

					11:40 CEST+02:00				", The Local,Social Democrats call for tougher rules on labour migration to Sweden,"
Sweden's governing party the Social Democrats on Wednesday vowed to tighten labour immigration rules if they win the election in September. 

	Prime Minister Stefan Löfven and Ylva Johansson, minister for employment and integration, presented the bid at the Social Democrats' headquarters in Stockholm at a press conference attended by The Local.

	""Labour immigration should focus on professions where the right staff cannot be found on the Swedish labour market. Jobs where there is no labour shortage should primarily be filled by unemployed people already living in Sweden,"" reads the party's proposal. 

	It further suggests that a government agency should be in charge of assessing the need for certain skills in Sweden, taking into account advice from employers. By and large people outside the European Economic Area should not be offered jobs in Sweden unless there is a labour shortage in their area of work, it adds.

PREMIUM: How many work permits have been granted in 2018, and to whom?

	Asked by The Local if there is any evidence that Swedes will opt to do the kind of unskilled jobs taken by labour migrants in the country, Johansson replied:

	""The very definition of a deficit profession (professions where staffing cannot be filled by the Swedish labour market) is that there isn't someone there to do the job or enough people who apply for that job, so it would be considered a deficit profession if those people don't exist.""

	""But it's the case today that we direct quite a lot of tax money towards creating jobs and making it easier for people who speak bad Swedish and have low competency to get their first job in Sweden. I don't think it's feasible that we subsidize through taxes the jobs that go to people who come as labour migrants from the other side of the world, that's a poor use of tax funds.""

	As for whether the Social Democrats are now singling out people who came to Sweden to work through legal means as a problem, the employment and integration minister contended that ""it's not the people who are the problem, it's the employers who exploit people in vulnerable situations that are the problem"".

	And she insisted that there is no need for internationals to be concerned by an apparent sharpening in rhetoric from the Social Democrats on immigrants (including finance minister Magdalena Andersson saying earlier this week that ""Sweden doesn't need foreign cleaners"").

	""Don't be concerned, we need many labour migrants and will in the future. We need to make it simpler to come here as a labour migrant within the areas where they're needed, and we want to ensure that serious employers are not out-competed by those who abuse the system,"" Johansson concluded.

	Last year, around 15,500 people from non-EU countries received work permits in Sweden. Almost a third of those moved for jobs which required less than tertiary level education, data from the Swedish Migration Agency shows. In the first three months of 2018, around one in seven of the work permits granted fell into this category.

	Sweden's existing rules on labour migration, put together by the centre-right Alliance and the Green Party in 2008, state that it falls to employers to determine whether they need foreign workers to fill jobs. Previously this had been decided by assessments of labour shortages from the Swedish Employment Agency and unions.

	Sweden has taken in record numbers of immigrants in recent years, and concerns have previously been raised about how to plug a growing employment gap between people born in Sweden and abroad. By the end of 2017 the unemployment rate was only four percent for native Swedes, and 22.2 percent for foreign-born.

The European Union has called an emergency meeting of interior and justice ministers in two weeks to find concrete measures to cope with escalating migration. 

	Luxembourg, which holds the EU's rotating presidency, announced the extraordinary meeting, to be held on September 14th, late on Sunday following a joint call for action by Germany, France and Britain.

	“The situation of migration phenomena outside and inside the European Union has recently taken unprecedented proportions,” it said in a statement.

	The number of migrants reaching the EU's borders reached nearly 340,000 during the first seven months of the year, up from 123,500 during the same period in 2014, according to the bloc's border agency Frontex.

	At least 2,300 migrants have died at sea since January during attempts to reach Europe, almost invariably on overcrowded boats chartered by people smugglers. Just last week, 71 decomposing bodies were discovered in an abandoned truck in Austria -- in a grim reminder of the ruthlessness of human traffickers.

	Swedish justice and migration minister Morgan Johansson welcomed the extraordinary meeting and called for joint efforts to tackle the Europe-wide crisis.

	“It is an issue which Sweden has been virtually alone in pushing, but it is becoming more and more obvious that it has to happen. I hope more countries realize that,” he told the TT news agency.

	The meeting in Brussels is set to discuss international cooperation, measures to prevent trafficking and how to outline a return policy.

Barbed wire fences installed at Helsingör in Denmark appear to have put a stop to migrants trying to cling onto trucks to cross into Sweden without going through identification checks, according to a new report. 

	Eight people have on four separate occasions attempted to skirt ID controls on the Swedish-Danish border by hiding on or underneath trucks travelling by Öresund ferries from Helsingör to Helsingborg in Sweden, according to a report sent by the Danish justice ministry to the parliament's judicial committee.

	The first incident reported to the Scandlines/HH Ferries company happened on April 12th, when two people tried to board the ferry by ""lying down on some trucks' wheel axles"", according to Danish police cited in the official document. The pair ran off after they were discovered by drivers but were never caught by police.

	Two days later, another two people were caught hiding under the wheel arches of a truck on board the ferry. They were handed over to Danish police and returned to Helsingör.

	On April 17th a person ran off after being discovered by security staff while trying to hide underneath a truck. A day later a transport worker reported seeing three people trying to hide in a vehicle at the port in Helsingör.

	The same month a Swedish police spokesperson told media that they had received reports of people successfully entering the country on trucks. Details were scarce at the time but police said members of the public had seen migrants under a truck on the E6 motorway in Helsingborg, while others were seen leaving a vehicle at a nearby rest stop. 

	According to the Danish justice ministry's report, which was written in mid-May but only grabbed headlines on Tuesday, no more attempts have been made since security was boosted and higher barbed wire fences put up at the ferry terminal in Helsingör. The extra security patrols have since been stepped down.

	Last month Swedish police told The Local, after five asylum seekers for the first time successfully crossed the famous Öresund bridge from Copenhagen to Malmö on foot, that the number of illicit border crossings may well be higher than previously known.

	""There are gaps in the net, because the border control is peripheral, it's not one hundred percent. There are probably hidden statistics,"" said police spokesperson Ewa-Gun Westford at the time.

	The number of people seeking asylum in Sweden has dropped dramatically since the new ID and border controls were introduced, with an average of less than 500 a week showing up in the Nordic country, compared to almost 10,000 during the autumn.

Swedish companies are exploiting labour migration legislation, with work permits being sold for up to 30,000 kronor ($4,560) and either non-existent or poorly paid jobs offered in return. 

The money is then stolen by the business owners, according to a report in the Dagens Nyheter (DN) daily on Friday.
Sweden's Hotel & Restaurant Workers Union (Hotell och Restaurang Facket - HRF) argues that an under-class labour force is being created in Sweden, with low pay and non-existent job security. 
""We come into contact with people who work 12 hours a day, seven days per week, often on monthly salaries of 2,000-3,000 kronor,"" said HRF Chairwoman Ella Niia in statement on its website.
Niia continued to say that when exploited workers complain at the conditions under which they are working, they risk losing their work permits.
""If they protest or go to the unions they are then sacked and lose their right to reside in Sweden. The system which has been built up by the government means that it is the employer who in principle decides if you get to stay or not,"" she said.
""Who would then protest against poor working conditions or pay that does not arrive?""
Ingemo Melin Olsson at Stockholm border police, explained to DN that the law opening up labour migration to Sweden invites abuse by unscrupulous business people, arguing that labour migration is the next major area of trafficking.
""There are companies that use the fact that people are so desperate that they are prepared to work 15 hours a day, more of less free, to perhaps get a permanent residence permit four years later,"" she said.
Migration Minister Tobias Billström confirmed that he takes the information seriously and has summoned officials from the Migration Board (Migrationsverket) to inform him about the situation.
""I plan to call together labour market representatives to to hear how they see the situation,"" Billström said.
He explained that the government's position is that labour market immigration is needed and that the Migration Board should handle the applications.
""Sham employment should be combated, but the need for labour is going to grow. The system's foundation is good,"" Billström said."

European leaders upset by the recent tragedy that claimed hundreds of migrants' lives near Lampedusa are wrong to accuse the European Union of inaction, argues Swedish MEP Cecilia Wikström of the Liberal Party (Folkpartiet). 
  Reactions from Europe’s heads of state following the tragic incident where hundreds of refugees lost their lives in the Mediterranean Sea a few weeks ago have finally begun to emerge.        “Europe wakes up only when migrants are dying,"" Maltese Prime Minister Joseph Muscat said after the tragedy. Italian Prime Minister Enrico Letta urged the EU to do more to help the individual member states deal with the influx of migrants, and has agreed with his Greek counterpart Antonis Samaras to make EU’s migration policy one of the key issues during the two countries’ presidencies next year.        Sweden’s Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt called for “comprehensive solutions” in the EU for the reception of refugees and migrants in the future in order to avoid similar incidents as those witnessed in Lampedusa.        I deeply regret, however, that only after hundreds of refugees lost their lives at once in the Mediterranean Sea has the refugee issue become a key concern for our ministers. But blaming the EU for not doing enough is incorrect.        As a matter of fact, the European Commission has repeatedly presented progressive legislative proposals to the European Parliament and European Council. But while we in parliament respond positively by uniting political groups and forming a position, member states always manage to put on the brakes. Reluctance, passivity, and constantly referring to the principle of subsidiarity mean that refugee proposals are being eroded and made ineffective.        It seems cynical that the same voices from various member states are now accusing the EU of doing too little are the same as those that repeatedly refused to give the EU the necessary tools to intervene. This applies, for example, to the expanded mandate for border control programmes Frontex and Eurosur. And let's not forget the member states’ failure to respond to the Commission’s plea for more countries to receive quota refugees.        Presently, we are working on a new proposal for rescue at sea, as well as guidelines for Frontex and member states in this mission. Again it’s the same old song and dance, however, as the member states have shown no willingness to work on this report in order to clarify who is responsible and how rescue work should be best conducted.  The only way to prevent another horrific incident with boat refugees is to create legal and safe ways for refugees to enter Europe in order to apply for asylum.        By issuing humanitarian visas at European embassies or consular offices in temporary refugee camps in third countries and by increasing the number of quota refugees, we can prevent traffickers from taking advantage of the situation. Presently, the only hope for many people is to pay up to €10,000 ($13,500) to a trafficker for a seat in one of those dangerous boats that in many cases are in no condition to make the trip across the Mediterranean Sea.     
  Unfortunately, too many heads of state in the EU are cowards: they do not consider themselves to have enough support from their constituents to transform their fine words about humanity and solidarity into concrete policy decisions.        Unfortunately, migrants losing their lives in the Mediterranean as they search for a better life in Europe is nothing new. According to the International Organization for Migration, since 1993 over 20,000 people have drowned in what is being turned into the dead sea. The real figure is much higher. Every day, new boats leave the harbours of the African continent. In this migration debate, people are being turned into numbers. Migrants are not commodities. They are mothers, fathers, children and friends. They deserve both their lives and a future.      Cecilia Wikström, Liberal Party (Folkpartiet) Member of the European Parliament     "

Four men were pulled out of the Öresund strait between Sweden and Denmark on Sunday in a large-scale rescue operation involving boats, helicopters and divers. 

	The rescue operation was carried out off the coast of the Danish island of Saltholm near the Öresund Bridge.  

	An island resident told Danish network TV2 that two of the men had earlier knocked on the door of a house on Saltholm and appeared to be under the false impression that they had reached Sweden. They had apparently spoken poor English and said they wanted to seek asylum.  

	According to the witness they then asked the resident for a glass of water and left the home. The sea rescue operation got underway shortly thereafter. 

	A Copenhagen Police spokesman told TV2 that the group was rescued between Saltholm and the artificial island of Peberholm, where the water is around eight degrees.

	“Four people were swimming around in the water. Three of them came onto land at Saltholm on their own and the fourth person was raised out of the water by a helicopter,” vice inspector Henrik Møller Jakobsen said. 

	By Tuesday afternoon, two of the four people were still in hospital receiving treatment, with one remaining on a respirator.

	Jakobsen said that an investigation was underway, but did not release any information about the nationality of the four men. Police did say, however, that the men had most recently been living at a large asylum centre in Denmark. 

	“We are trying to figure out what happened. The first order of business is to determine if their papers are legitimate and how they got out there. Did they sail, were they brought out to Peberholm or did they get there some other way?,” Jakobsen said.

	Despite Sweden recently tightening its residency rules, many migrants still perceive it as a more attractive destination than Denmark, where measures to reduce immigration have included passing a law that allows police to search asylum seekers for valuables.

	Copenhagen police revealed last month that dozens of people have tried to walk over the high-speed Öresund Bridge that connects Copenhagen to Malmö in an effort to avoid Sweden’s new ID controls, which were implemented in January after it took in 163,000 asylum seekers last year and said it could not cope with the influx.

	The crossing, made famous in the Nordic Noir detective series The Bridge (Broen), allows drivers to travel at up to 90 kilometres an hour and includes a motorway tunnel as well as an open air road section.

	Copenhagen police have recently installed new warning signs designed to deter walkers as well as heat sensors to better allow them to trace people making the potentially deadly journey.

	Ferry operators have also warned that growing numbers of asylum seekers are trying to get to Sweden from Denmark by clinging to the undersides of trucks boarding ferries in an apparent attempt to avoid the ID checks.

UPDATED: Campaigners are gathered at a controversial camp in Malmö that has been home to hundreds of mostly Roma people, but is set to be cleared by police and local authorities. 

	The camp has been occupied by around 200 people for months, but following a decision from Malmö city council’s environmental committee, they were asked to leave the camp by 4pm on Sunday or face eviction.

	However, police failed to show up, with some of the residents remaining there overnight amid rumours that it would be cleared on Monday morning instead.

	As the city's rush hour got under way, campaigners arrived at the camp to show their support for the EU migrants, who have been living in caravans, tents, shacks and cars on the land, which is in an industrial area of Sweden's third largest city.

	""They can lift us out. If we do not get to stay here we will be forced to sleep on the street,"" one 22-year-old, named simply as Daniel from Romania, told the TT news agency.

	A firecracker was thrown at the camp overnight, with some media reporting that a woman was injured. Several ambulances were sent to the scene but police later told regional Swedish newspaper Sydsvenskan that nobody had been hurt in the blast.

	Under Swedish law both locals and visitors alike usually have the right to walk or camp on almost any land, although this does not include public land that is adjacent to residential property or privately-owned gardens.

	The case of the camp in Malmö is unique because the person who owns the land tolerated the migrants – who are mainly Roma people from Romania and Bulgaria – for six months before launching a trespassing case with police.

	Sweden's national government recently announced it was set to appoint an investigator to review the country's regulatory framework for eviction.

	Some municipalities in other parts of Sweden have already evicted groups of Roma from public land including in the capital, Stockholm.

	Malmö city council is offering accommodation for five nights for around 50 people from the camp and trying to find help for the migrants in their home villages in Romania.

The Swedish Migration Board (Migrationsverket) estimates that 37,000 labour migrants from countries outside the European Union (EU) will seek work permits in Sweden next year. 

The information comes from Christina Werner, a Migration Board official in charge of the agency's planning ahead of a new law which is set to take effect on December 15th.
The new regulations will do away with the strict labour market tests currently required for anyone outside the EU seeking an employment visa in Sweden.
After the change, employers themselves will be able to determine if they wish to hire someone. Under current rules, such a determination is carried out by the Swedish Public Employment Service (Arbetsförmedlingen).
Looking ahead, the Migration Board expects that the new opportunities to receive a work visa will reduce the number of immigrant refugees. 
Earlier forecasts by the agency handed over to the government estimated that Sweden could expect 25,000 asylum seekers in 2009.
The 37,000 people expected to enter under the new rules includes not only those seeking work permits, but also their families and relatives.
“It's hard to predict, but we believe that the flow of refugees will ebb. We know that there are people who today apply for asylum but who really want to apply for work permits,” Werner told news agency TT.
The basic requirement to apply for a work and residence permit is the offer of a job which pays enough for someone to support themselves.
The terms of employment cannot be worse than those which apply to workers covered by collective agreements or which are considered standard practice for a given industry.
After two years a labour migrant can apply for an extended residence permit, if the job remains, and after four years the residence permit can be made permanent.
The proposal is supported by the government and the Green Party. 
The Riksdag plans to hold a final vote on the law on November 12th.

					14:31 CEST+02:00				",None,'Every global citizen should work in Sweden',"
Sweden's efforts to liberalize rules governing labour migration are meant to ensure that working in Sweden becomes an obvious choice for every global citizen, argues migration minister Tobias Billström. 

Continued openness to the outside world is critical to our future development. Mobility, both migration and international trade, promotes our economic growth. 
It must also be noted that Sweden is a small country on the edge of Europe with a climate that isn't altogether welcoming for part of the year. Sweden has therefore taken a leading role in international migration. When others lower the barriers, we open more roads. In the global competition for labor, Sweden should be able to attract the people who move across borders.
The government's policy is based on getting more people working and creating the conditions for more and growing businesses. At the same time, there is a labour shortage in some occupations and industries, current unemployment notwithstanding.
The increasing proportion of elderly people in the population also represents a serious long-term challenge to the sustainability of our welfare system. To successfully address these challenges requires foresight and political action. Our premise is that mobility is something positive.
Labour migration is a way to, in the short and long term, prevent a shortage of labour. Following reforms enacted in 2008, the prerequisites are in place for meeting the needs of the Swedish labour market by now allowing employers decide what skills are needed at the company. 
There's no public authority as well suited as the employers themselves for assessing those needs and therefore there are no restrictive quotas or no requirements for a specific skill or education level. 
However, the demands that are very clearly stated are that the pay and employment conditions must not be inferior to collective wage agreements or common practices in the industry. We therefore need to open the supply of jobs to a wider audience, and to widen the supply of labor for firms operating in Sweden.
The OECD noted at the end of last year that Sweden now has the most liberal system for labour migration of all OECD countries. That's good news because a simple and effective regulatory framework for labour migration can help to make it attractive to actually choose Sweden, both for establishing businesses and for those who migrate.
Sweden's demand-driven system has attracted interest from traditional destination countries for labour migrants such as Australia and Canada. The point systems and quotas applied there are not able to meet the labour market's true needs. Meanwhile, labor immigrants' skills and expertise aren't always fully utilized.
Today's globalized labour market means that temporary and recurrent migration, rather than a permanent move from one country to another, has become increasingly common. Past patterns of movement are giving way to what is called circular migration, a movement to a country and then return to their country of origin or another country. Most of us today likely know at least one so-called circular migrant. Nor is it a strictly a new phenomenon, with the great emigration of Swedes to the United States at the end of the 1800s and the subsequent trek back to Sweden serving as an early example of circular migration.
To follow up on labour migration reforms, the government in 2009 appointed a parliamentary committee on circular migration and development. Last year it presented proposals to widen the scope for increased mobility between Sweden and migrants countries of origin. In a globalized labour market, it's about attracting skills and ensuring that working in Sweden become a natural part of every global citizen's CV.
People's decisions and movements across borders aren't only affected by the regulations governing their entry and exit or their work and residence permits. 
Equally important are issues of family, taxation and social security benefits. Labour migrants who come to Sweden today already have the opportunity to bring their families, who in turn are also given access to the Swedish labour market. It's also appropriate to further develop the possibilities for migrant workers to transfer their accrued rights to countries as well as the portability of Swedish social security benefits. We also need to consider our tax system in light of the international competition for labour.
With this openness and positive view on mobility, Sweden can be attractive not only for labour migrants, but also for employers, foreign investors and entrepreneurs. Perhaps we may eventually see even more international corporations headquartered in the Swedish cities.

					15:02 CEST+02:00				",Faisal Enayat Khan,The hidden lives of Sweden’s undocumented migrants,"
Sweden has taken in thousands of asylum seekers in recent year. But not all have had their applications accepted. Faisal Enayat Khan describes his encounters with just a handful of Sweden's estimated 15,000 undocumented migrants.  

Ahmad curses the mess that is his life as he winds his way down the narrow spiral staircase of the three-storey building he has been working in for the last two weeks. The 28-year-old building contractor from Afghanistan has been eking out an existence outside the system ever since his most recent asylum application was rejected by the Swedish authorities last year.  
The Migration Board made it clear that his country was sufficiently secure to permit his safe return. But Ahmad scoffs at the notion and says he has decided to live and die in Sweden. 
“The Migration Board says that we have an army and police. I hope they understand that these are the same guys who have taken part in the 30 year old Afghan war; they have just changed their brand name from Mujahedin to National Army or National Police Force,” he tells The Local.  
Ahmad came to Sweden as an asylum seeker when his father was killed by the victorious Mujahedin, who assumed control of the security situation in Afghanistan after the US led coalition smashed the hard line Taliban regime in late 2001. 
“They killed my father because he was an honest civil servant and did not share the ideas they had,” he tells The Local. 
“If they had found me they would definitely have killed me too.” 
After almost two years spent passing through various countries at the hands of human smugglers, he finally reached Sweden in 2004 and applied for asylum.
But the Swedish Migration Board rejected his application. Writing to him in late 2005, the board said it did not believe that Ahmad’s life would be in danger if he was sent back to Afghanistan. The country had become more stable, the letter read, and there were thousands of foreign troops to help police its more lawless territories. 
Ahmad is one of around six hundred Afghans who have chosen to live in hiding after the Migration Board threatened them with deportation. Their fate shared by an estimated 15,000 foreign nationals living in Sweden as undocumented migrants.   
Ahmad’s situation was not always this bleak. Between November 2005 and March 2006, the then Social Democratic-led government introduced a temporary amnesty making it possible for around 30,000 migrants to have their asylum applications reassessed under more generous terms than was previously the case. 
The amnesty covered both migrants who had been living in hiding, as well as those whose applications had been rejected but were stuck in Sweden because of unrest in their home countries or a lack of cooperation from authorities in their home countries in carrying out Sweden's deportation orders.This resulted in the granting of 13,051 permanent residence permits and 4,282 one-year permits. 
Ahmad managed to secure a one-year residence permit in the spring of 2006, along with a promise that the board would review his case again a year later. 
Relieved at having received permission to remain in Sweden, Ahmad set up a construction firm, rented a house and began developing a social network. 
“Life was great,” he says. “I felt like a human being again after a very long and difficult time in my life.” 
But the glorious year passed quickly and in the summer of 2007 Ahmad received a letter from the Migration Board stating that it was preparing to review his case. 
“I knew nothing good would come of it. So I abandoned my apartment, fired my employees, sold my truck and went into hiding,” he says. 
His prognosis proved correct: the Migration Board revoked his residence permit and advised him to return to Afghanistan or face forced deportation. 
Ever since the board decided to review his application, Ahmad has been living in a three room rental apartment in the suburbs with six of his similarly “illegal” countrymen.  
Though Ahmad is better off than his flatmates, the jobs he takes do not pay well and sometimes he is not paid at all. But he earns enough to feed himself and, when needs must, some of his compatriots. 
“We are all in the same boat,” he says.  
As the bus from work weaves it ways through a wealthy suburban neighbourhood, Ahmad points out a brown apartment building that houses the clinic he visits if ever he gets sick. The clinic, which is run by Doctors of the World, is open once a week from 7pm to 9pm. 
A few days after meeting Ahmad, The Local returns to the clinic, where other migrants struggle to deal with their own personal dramas. 
Patients sit on a red corner sofa in a room at the end of an orange and off-white hallway. On the wall hangs a large portrait of the Hindu deity Krishna. A group of toddlers play with some old toys and a box full of Lego. The room is separated by a divider, on the other side of which sits a woman with bright green eyes and a broad smile.  
“Welcome to the asylum corner,” says Karolina Johansson, one of the clinic’s consultants.  
She explains that the clinic provides undocumented migrants with more than just medical care; they are also offered free survival tips and asylum consultation. 
“We basically inform people who live in hiding how to avoid situations which could endanger their lives,” says Johansson. 
But just as she runs through the clinic’s sundry services, a young man approaches and imparts some bad news. 
“Hi Karolina,” he says. “Did you hear about those seven Afghans who were taken by the police from the food factory?” 
“No!” says Johansson, visibly upset by the news.  
The men in question were arrested by the Swedish Border Police on June 4th at a food processing plant in the suburbs of Stockholm following an unsuccessful appeal to the Migration Court. 
Ahmad is furious when he hears about the raid later. He directs his anger not at the police but at his fellow countrymen. 
“They should have known better than to work in a place for which the police have the address,” he says. 
“Look at me. I abandoned my own business just to avoid arrest.” 
Back in the clinic, the drama continues to unfold. 
One woman is there to renew her ageing mother’s prescriptions, while a Serbian man tells a lawyer that his son will never make a full recovery if his family is deported. 
A couple from Azerbaijan have brought in their three-year-old daughter Alex in the hope of finding a doctor who can help cure her of a respiratory ailment that has been keeping them all awake at night. 
Alex’s parents have lived in Sweden for 4 years, two and a half of which have been spent in hiding. 
“Of course it is hard to live here the way we do, but the consequences of going back home make the difficulties we face here pale into insignificance,” says the girl’s father. 
Most of the undocumented migrants are encouraged by the clinic to stay on in Sweden in the hope of securing an amnesty, or at last until the statute of limitations permits asylum seekers to apply anew. 
“There is always hope at the end of the tunnel,” says Karolina Johansson. 
But both Ahmad and the patients at the clinic hold out little hope of emerging from their hiding places until 2010 at the earliest; Migration Minister Tobias Billström has said there will be no amnesty for refugees during the current term.

UPDATED: The Swedish surveillance and rescue ship Posedion has helped a large group of migrants attempting to cross the Mediterranean sea from Libya. 

	Posedion has been patrolling the waters between Italy and Libya since June 1st, as part of EU-wide efforts to help migrants making the dangerous journey between the two nations.

	The ship, which is more than 90 metres long, picked up 262 people travelling in wooden boats on Sunday night, after the migrants sent out distress signals.

	It is the first time a Swedish ship has been involved in the current efforts to help refugees in the Mediterranean.

	“We rescued those on board, everything went really well and the weather is good with very few waves. Right now we're heading towards Sicily,” Joakim Håkansson, Poseidon's commander, told the TT newswire via satellite phone on Sunday.

	He said the rescue operation had taken place eleven kilometres north of Tripoli and that the migrants had reported being at sea for around twelve hours.

	Once safe and dry on Posedion, the migrants were given food and water as well as access to toilets and washing facilities and were sat underneath large tarpaulin sails to protect them from the sun.

	“They seem to feel good. Some are tired and have fallen asleep and others are standing and talking,” Håkansson reported.

	He said that the migrants were understood to have travelled to the Libyan capital from Eritrea, Somalia and Syria.

	According to the Reuters news agency, a total of 2400 migrants were rescued in the Mediterranean on Sunday, with Italian, German, British and Irish vessels joining Triton, the international search-and-rescue operation being run by Frontex, the European Union’s joint border control agency.

	The operation takes place as the Mediterranean crisis remains hotly debated across Europe.

	The European Commission has asked all EU member states to take in a proportion of the refugees seeking asylum in the 28-member bloc.

	But several countries have voiced concerns about the strategy including Hungary, Slovakia, Spain and Estonia. The UK has chosen to avoid the plans due to an existing EU agreement which allows it to ‘opt out’ of some issues.

	Sweden already takes in more asylum seekers per capita than any other member state. Last month it was told to help relocate 821 migrants who have arrived in Italy and 548 who have travelled to Greece as part of the European Commission's controversial plans.

Three in four of those asylum seekers subjected to a new method of medically assessing their age by examining their teeth and knee joints have so far been found to be older than 18. 

	The national forensic medicine agency (Rättsmedicinalverket) began to carry out the tests earlier this year.

	They are designed to make age assessment during the asylum process more accurate, after the migration authority was criticized for failings in assessing the correct age of some refugees claiming to be underage.

	The agency has so far received around 4,200 requests from the Migration Agency and has completed assessments of the ages of a total of 581 people. It is only asked to carry out the tests in cases when the person's age is in question.

	The test results in 442 of these 581 cases ""suggest that the person examined is 18 years or older"", according to Rättsmedicinalverket. Of these, 430 were men and 12 women.

	Its experts also found that five of the test results, all women, ""possibly suggest that the person examined is 18 years or older"" and that in 134 cases (133 males and one female) the examination ""possibly suggests that the person examined is under 18"".

	The method of medical age assessment consists of taking X-rays of wisdom teeth, and MRI scans of knee joints, which are then analyzed by dentists and radiologists.

	The Migration Agency stressed the figures did not show that asylum seekers who lie about their age represent the majority of applicants, as the tests are only carried out in cases where it believes existing evidence is not enough.

	""If all unaccompanied minors had undergone a medical age evaluation then the results would likely have been different,"" Daniel Salehi, a manager at the agency, told Swedish newswire TT. He said the result would then have been the opposite, that most unaccompanied children are indeed under the age of 18.

	Around 9.5 million people live in Sweden while there are 5.6 million in Denmark.

	 

2. Sweden has offered permanent residency to all Syrian arrivals

	 

	Refugees fleeing the violence in Syria make up the largest proportion of people seeking asylum across Europe and in 2013 Sweden became the first country in Europe to rule that all refugees from the war-torn nation would be granted permanent residency in the light of the worsening conflict. 

	 

	However the Swedish government announced plans to tighten the rules again again in November 2015.

	 

	Denmark introduced temporary one-year permits for Syrian refugees last year with the stated intention of sending them back home ""as soon as conditions improve"" in the war-ravaged country.

3. Many refugees already have family in Sweden

	 

	Given the huge numbers of Syrians who have already been given protection in Sweden (16,785 in 2014 alone), it is unsurprising that many refugees would prefer to set up home close to friends and family.

	 

	Sweden has previously offered residency permits to immediate family members of those already granted asylum (husband, wife, partner and children - under the age of 18), but announced stricter time limits in November.

	 

	Last year, Denmark said it would only allow for family reunifications if a refugee's initial one-year residency permit was renewed, a move heavily criticized by the United Nations Refugee Agency and others. 

	 

4. Sweden offers strong social benefits for refugees

	 

	Asylum seekers are offered immediate emergency accommodation on arrival in Sweden before being relocated to temporary housing. Single adults are given a daily benefit of 71 Swedish kronor per day (2,159 kronor or $256 per month), with more available for those with families. 

	 

	Those granted asylum are then given help finding accommodation, are entitled to free Swedish for Immigrants lessons and may also be offered an 'introduction benefit' from Arbetsförmedlingen, Sweden's Employment Agency, giving them an income of 6,468 Swedish kronor per month ($769) while they search for work.

	 

	Denmark also offers social benefits and free language lessons for immigrants. But while it is generally more expensive to live in Denmark than in Sweden, the Danish government has recently slashed the amount of so-called 'integration' money it gives to new arrivals by 45 percent to 5,945 Danish kroner ($891) for a a single adult with no children. This too was subject to criticism from the United Nations and humanitarian organizations.

5. Global reputation

	 

	Sweden has an international image of openness and tolerance.  The current government is a Social Democrat-Green coalition which has spoken out strongly in favour of helping refugees. However it announced in October 2015 that pressure on resources meant that it could no longer guarantee accommodation for everyone.  Meanwhile, the anti-immigration Sweden Democrat party is growing in popularity, but is not part of the government or the country's main centre-right opposition Alliance bloc.

	 

	By contrast, Denmark's new single-party government is led by the right-of-centre Venstre, which needs the support of the anti-immigration Danish People's Party to push its agendas through parliament.

	 

	The Danish government recently launched an information campaign in foreign newspapers to deter refugees from setting foot on Danish soil. Even the country's former centre-left government headed by Helle Thorning-Schmidt touted a hard-line approach to refugees and immigrants, a record that came back to haunt her on Wednesday when she was passed over for for the position of UN High Commissioner for Refugees.

Sweden's decision to welcome Bulgarians and Romanians back in 2007 has benefited state coffers, new Gothenburg University research revealed on Tuesday. The UK, the Swedish economist argued, stands to benefit even more. 
 Bulgarian and Romanian migrants contribute more than they cost to Western European economies, which should stand as a lesson to the wary UK which stands to benefit the most from an influx,  a Swedish economist said Tuesday.  Joakim Ruist, a researcher at Gothenburg University, did precise calculations for Sweden, where Bulgarians and Romanians have worked freely since joining the EU in 2007, and estimates for 14 other EU member states.  ""My findings clearly show that the fears that are currently expressed in other European countries of unrestricted immigration from Romania and Bulgaria imposing a heavy burden on the welfare state are unfounded,"" Ruist said in a statement.  The report came one day after EU Employment Commissioner Laszlo Andor said that migrants contribute more than they take in their new countries and tend not to take jobs away from host workers.  In Sweden, one of the EU's most generous countries with its immigrants, and also the one with the largest gap between national and immigrant unemployment figures, Bulgarian or Romanian migrants contribute to the state 30 percent more than they cost, according to the economist.  ""This positive result is due to migrants receiving substantially less welfare benefits and being subject to substantially less public spending,"" Ruist said. ""This more than outweighs the fact that they earn less and hence pay less in taxes than the population on average.""  The researcher argued that the UK and Ireland are among the countries that benefit most from this immigration, since they a have well-known language and ""smaller welfare sectors"".  The EU migration issue heated up sharply ahead of January 1st when Bulgarians and Romanians got full rights to free movement in the European Union, sparking fears of a massive influx of migrants living on the state or taking jobs away from locals.  In response to calls for limits, the UK rushed through measures in December restricting access to unemployment handouts for new EU migrants but the feared flood of Romanians and Bulgarians notably failed to materialize.   Sweden joined a long list of critics of the British government's handling of immigration fears, with Swedish Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeld voicing his concern last year and telling his UK counterpart David Cameron that the fear of welfare abuse had proved unfounded in Sweden.   ""We didn't see this big social tourism that everyone warned us about, and it might be wise to share that experience with others,"" Reinfeldt told Sveriges Radio (SR) earlier last year. Sweden's Social Affairs Minister Göran Hägglund was equally if not more critical.   ""I think it's a terrible way to express oneself. I think (Cameron's) speech is very, very unfortunate,"" Hägglund told SR, specifically, taking issue with how Cameron ""pitted us against them"" when speaking of migrants.  The new Swedish study used as a sample a fifth of the 10,000 Bulgarians and Romanians who lived in Sweden at the end of 2011, comparing their contributions via taxes with their use of public services, such as social benefits, health care, and education.

					08:13 CEST+02:00				",AFP/The Local,How immigration is putting Swedish schools to the test,"
What Sweden's already struggling schools are doing to cope with the challenge of record immigration. 

	Of the roughly 245,000 migrants who have arrived in the Scandinavian country since 2014, 70,000 are under the age of 18, according to figures quoted by the AFP news agency on Wednesday.

	The majority of these youngsters are Syrians, Afghans and Iraqis who have been robbed of a proper schooling by war and exile.

	“It's a real challenge,” Education Minister Gustav Fridolin said in an interview with AFP.

	The Swedish school system already faces major challenges including an acute shortage of qualified teachers – 60,000 more are needed by 2019 – and declining scores in standardized international tests. The quality of education can also vary significantly from school to school.

	A Unicef report published in April showed that Sweden, along with neighbouring Finland, is the country where school results declined the most between 2006 and 2012.

	The Swedish National Agency for Education blames the decline in school performance on the large number of foreign students who they say drag down results because of language issues.

	In 2014, 14 percent of students had results too low to qualify for the second part of secondary school (for pupils aged 16 to 18), a 10 percent deterioration on the 2006 level.

	The lower level of pupils qualifying for further education was due to the rising number of students who migrated to Sweden after school starting age, who struggled to catch up as a result, according to the report.

	Fridolin said that it is “much more costly” for society to pay for a school system that has failed migrants than it is to give them a good education in the first place.

	In the Södertälje municipality south of Stockholm, 37 percent of residents are born abroad. Three years ago, authorities decided to assign two teachers to each primary school class to ensure students got the attention they needed.

	“The students get more help, the classes can be adapted to their needs and the teachers feel less stressed,” said Södertälje's head of schoos, Monica Sonde.

	The gamble seems to be paying off, with the number of students qualifying for upper secondary school on the rise.

	At the Wasa primary and middle school, 90 percent of students speak Arabic and almost one in five pupils arrived in Sweden in the past two years.

	But Mark Khoazzoum, an 11-year-old whose father was a doctor in Aleppo, Syria, needed just three months in an adaptation class before he was ready to move into regular lessons.

	He now speaks good Swedish. But the language “is still an obstacle when I want to describe things”, he said.

	The scale of the challenges facing new immigrants varies depending on their country of origin.

	“Syria has a pretty adequate school system while countries like Iraq, Afghanistan and Somalia have very weak school systems, which means that students from these countries may not have attended school before arriving in Sweden,” said Anders Auer, a policy analyst at the country's education agency.

	Newly-arrived children are usually placed in adaptation classes where they learn Swedish, their knowledge levels are tested and they receive schooling in their mother tongue. Within two years, they are expected to have caught up enough to be able to enter the regular curriculum.

	They usually face hurdles all the way through their education, but “in our statistics, we have noted that the foreign students are more motivated than those born Sweden”, said Auer. But he added: “Even though they're motivated they have a hard time.”

Around 7,000 unaccompanied refugee children arrived in Sweden in 2014, twice as many as the year before. And some parts of the country aren't coping, according to reports.
 
  A total of 81,300 people found refuge in Sweden in 2014, a jump of almost 50 percent from the 54,300 in 2013.        Among the refugees, 7,000 were children arriving without their families - almost double the figure from the previous year.        A law change that came into effect last January means that the unaccompanied minors can be sent to any municipality in the country, regardless of whether the municipalities want them or not.         Some consider the influx to be problematic, including Patric Åberg of the city council in southern Sweden's Östra Göinge.         ""We have taken in unaccompanied minors since 2011, but the problem is that the municipalities taking in many of them have to take in even more - and we think it's devastating,"" he told the TT news agency.        He says that his municipality simply doesn't have the room to house so many children, and that other parts of Sweden should step up and take their share.        The municipality has requested an official court inquest into the matter.        ""We think there is a gap here and that we can get around it. We want the system to be changed at a fundamental level,"" he added.        A spokesman at the Migration Board argued that the change in the law has been positive.        ""The municipalities have shown a great deal of understanding for the new system, which means a much more even divide of children across the country,"" he said. ""They should be commended for their efforts in a year that saw historic levels of unaccompanied children.""    
  In 2014 Sweden took in its highest number of asylum seekers since 1992, when refugees flocked north from the Balkan war. The refugees came mostly from Syria, with a total of 30,600 fleeing to Sweden - 14,300 more than in 2013. "

An estimated 100 immigrants abandoned their car-park camp on Thursday after eviction threats from the Swedish Enforcement Authority. 
  The Bulgarian immigrants have been living in a make-shift camp in a train station car park near Gothenburg.   On Thursday morning the camp was deserted. At 7am only two men remained, and they disappeared shortly after.   The car park then stood empty, desolately freckled with remains from fire pits and clothes lines used the night before. Clusters of tents and cars had vanished.   The Gothenburg section of the Swedish Enforcement Authority (Kronofogden) planned to evict everyone from the camp later on Thursday morning, as setting up a camp on municipal land is illegal, regardless of whether the campers are Swedes or immigrants.   Personnel from the social services visited the camp several times in the days leading up to the eviction, and the campers left rather than waiting for it to happen.

The government and the Green Party (Miljöpartiet) want to tighten Sweden's labour laws to fight poor working conditions for migrants, with employers potentially risking prison if they don't provide accurate information about their workers. 

Employers could risk prison or fines if they don't cooperate with the Swedish Migration Board (Migrationsverket) by providing current and accurate information about the working conditions for migrants. Incorrect information could lead to a prison sentence of two years.
""This is very important,"" Migration Minister Tobias Billström told Sveriges Radio (SR) of the new deal struck with the Greens.
""The Migration Board has not previously had such clear tools for getting through these changes, if you look at how the regulations have been designed, and these are going to take effect in April next year.""
The new rules mean that the Swedish Migration Board (Migrationsverket) will have increased access to the databases of other public authorities. 
In the past, migrants coming to Sweden have been exploited by Swedish employers, with some being been paid slave-like wages, and others denied benefits to which they were entitled.
""There have been abuses in the system, but on the whole, it has worked well,"" Maria Ferm, spokesperson for the Green Party's migration policy, told reporters at a press conference with Billström, according to the TT news agency.

Migration Minister Tobias Billström has played a key role in convincing other countries to follow Sweden's example by taking in more Syrian refugees at a UN conference being held in Switzerland. 
  At a meeting for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in Geneva, the displacement of Syrian refugees has been high on the agenda.   The Swedish delegation has been leading an international working group with the task of finding homes for an estimated 34,000 Syrian asylum seekers, Sveriges Radio reports.   Following talks between Billström and dozens of other senior politicians, a total of 21 countries around the world have agreed to follow Sweden's lead in tackling the issue.   Billström said the agreement would enable the Syrian asylum seekers to seek refuge in a safe zone, most likely in the EU.   ""It feels very good and fortunate that this is happening,"" he told Sveriges Radio.    In September last year, Sweden granted permanent residence to all Syrian refugees who applied, the first country in the EU to do so.   Earlier in June it was revealed that Sweden took in almost 20 percent of EU's asylum seekers, more than any other nation - despite only representing 1.9 percent of the EU's population.
  In 2013 Sweden took in 26,395 asylum seekers, of which Syrians made up 46 percent.   By contrast, Germany took in 26,080 refugees (12,000 Syrians), while certain other countries in the EU, such as Austria, took in significantly smaller numbers of Syrians than Sweden.    That looks set to change following the agreement with the UNHCR, as Austria has agreed to take in 1,500 Syrians over the next year. Sweden is expected to rehouse another 1,200 Syrians.   Billström praised Germany for promising to provide asylum to 20,000 more people as part the agreement.   However, he said he was ""especially disappointed"" that just 14 of the EU's 28 member states were stepping up and participating in the refugee rehousing scheme.    In 2013, Sweden was UNHCR’s fifth largest donor.

What if you have lived in a country for ages, but still aren't seen as an 'integrated' immigrant? American political science PhD candidate Ian Higham writes about his worries for the election.  

	For the third time in my life, I am an immigrant. I moved to Sweden in 2015 to work as a PhD candidate in political science at Stockholm University. As an immigrant closely following the Swedish election to be held on Sunday, I can't help but remember 2012.

	I was living in London at the time and working on a master's degree at the London School of Economics. The Conservative Party won the general election in 2010, at which time I had been studying in Denmark. The Tories pledged during their campaign to cut immigration to the UK ""from the hundreds of thousands to the tens of thousands"".

	Theresa May became Home Secretary and was therefore responsible for turning this campaign promise into policy. Voters heard ""immigrant"" and thought of Muslim refugees bleeding the welfare state dry, of hearing Polish in the queue at Waitrose, of Sharia courts proliferating in Birmingham. But refugees are difficult to expel from a country for practical, legal and moral reasons, and EU migrants (pre-Brexit) could not be legally deported.

	Everyone said, ""But you're American. You will be allowed to stay. There's always a fast track for Americans. You're not a 'real immigrant.'"" Fast forward to July 2012 and me sobbing at Heathrow Airport, holding a one way ticket to New York.

	In order to deliver on their promise, the Tories in 2012 cut the post-study work visa – a Blair-era policy that encouraged graduates from British universities to stay and look for work in the UK. Without this visa, there were few realistic options for skilled migrants to remain in the UK absent unlimited personal wealth. I applied for more than 300 British jobs, and having a master's degree from one of the most prestigious universities in the country qualified me for an interview for precisely zero. Not one. Many companies sent me auto-reject e-mails when I ticked the ""needs sponsorship for a residence permit"" box on applications. The same was true for every non-EU student I knew at LSE.

	Now we have a fresh election coming in Sweden. The Social Democrats want to restrict labor migration to fields with a government-determined ""shortage"". The (so-called) Liberals and Moderates want to impose language and culture exams on people like me who want to stay and work in Sweden. The current immigration rules allow me to apply for permanent residence next year. If the right wins, I may not get it. If the left wins, am I guaranteed to be able to stay with my employer?

	In addition to working as an instructor and researcher at the university, I work with a consulting firm where I help global companies to enter the Swedish market and Swedish companies to grow and hire domestically. I am young and healthy, paying into a pension system from which I am not guaranteed to benefit. I do all of my work in English, not Swedish. I have dozens of close friends, who are the main reason I want to stay in Sweden. But for three of the mainstream political parties – and one on the far right – I may not, apparently, have ""integrated"" into Swedish society. I speak some Swedish, but my ability to pass a stringent language exam is not assured. And who knows what arbitrary cultural traditions I must have memorized in order to pass a culture exam.

	For less skilled migrants, there are still a ridiculous amount of obstacles to integration and to work that have nothing to do with language. The byzantine and ascetic housing system that imposes segregation is the biggest, but many other factors most Swedes never have to consider play a part. Swedish for Immigrants (SFI) courses are over-subscribed (in my SFI class, there were around 80 students), allowing little chance for many people to learn fluent Swedish. Private language courses, especially in the major cities, are very expensive.

	There is also the issue of restrictions on qualifications that making working – and getting to work – unnecessarily difficult for immigrants.

	It can cost more than 15,000 kronor to get a Swedish driving licence if one needs courses to pass the notoriously difficult Swedish driving exams; non-EU licences are invalid after the first year of residence. Canadians who have been driving for 30 years in their home country would be considered less qualified than a Swedish teenager with a learner's permit. How are refugees expected to pony up thousands of dollars to learn a skill they already have for a job they barely want?

	A Harvard doctorate in clinical psychology is worth less than a Swedish university's bachelor's degree for mental health professionals. And if you do work in a field with transferable qualifications, it can take months –  even years – to process the transfer. Yet the Liberals and Moderates rail on about language exams and cultural assimilation as the only path to work, while the Social Democrats insist that the government knows better than employers who to hire.

	Immigrants contribute enormously to Swedish society – and those who don't often want to, but can't. Swedes keep telling me, ""You'll be fine. You're educated and American. You're not THAT type of immigrant.""

	Well, I've heard that before, and it's bullshit.

					12:36 CEST+02:00				", The Local,'Well-meaning Swedes treat migrants like pets',"
With a xenophobic political party knocking on the door of the Riksdag, Swedish journalist Lars Åberg examines why, despite good intentions, many Swedes still view immigrants like household pets. 

Much has been written and said about the Sweden Democrats and their relationship to immigration. Similarly interesting are the established parties’ views on migration and on people who move to Sweden. 
By expressing horror at the Sweden Democrats, someone can still come across as well-intentioned even when expressing other forms of prejudice and actively reproducing constructed group characteristics.
The exotification of immigrants has become a political edifice of ideas which divides up the population and transforms it into an abstract collective suitable for clashes over group-based rights. 
The emphasis on immigration is an institutional torment; as second- and third-generation and eternal immigrants, people are never afforded an individual identity, but are rather treated like demanding members of some clan in need of special treatment.
Over the past forty years or so a policy has been formulated, and an administrative system of authority developed, which is based on sympathy for those who move here.
The rest of the world considers the Swedes to be tolerant and generous, and there are obvious economic reasons for why so many people come here. Only in Sweden is this generosity perceived and portrayed as humiliating, discriminatory, and xenophobic. Only here can it be considered problematic to greet a democratic system with domestic, everyday language.
In no other country do people make so many excuses for their achievements and so easily forget that they are based on a long political struggle infused with a strong mixture of social democracy and the women’s movement.
Society’s relationship to new arrivals is shaky, inconsistent, and, in a poor sense, subject to negotiation. Emotionally-charged descriptions – the unaccompanied refugee children, the undocumented, the diffuse refugee concept, and so on – reveal an anxiety about discussing the problem, which quite a few of us will, sooner or later, be confronted with in schools, in the health system, or on the street.
Instead of admitting to the radically altered conditions in schools, for example, and around peoples’ ability to support themselves, we instead talk about social exclusion. The essence of the debate in the media is seldom about how things actually look, but rather about how they should be, and this imagined reality is then formulated into political rhetoric, journalism, and information disseminated to the public and workers.
In our ambition to be compassionate and sympathetic – good ambitions! – we’ve created a special sort of being: the more or less immature newcomer. One can still hear people speak about “our immigrants” as if they were pets or birds that one feeds in the park. A benevolent perspective permeates integration policies and gives satisfaction to those who help and want to be friendly.
But still no one has added up the costs for all the operations, activities, and projects which have been started to provide support, but there must now be so much collective experience from various attempts to help people become self-sufficient and incorporated into society that it’s now possible to explain why so many are still living on public assistance. It is that knowledge and insight which can take us forward. Most people with experience in this area can probably attest to the fact that discrimination is not the main problem.
For those of us who grew up in the left movement of the 1970s, it was natural to embrace prevailing views among journalists and sociologists and other academics regarding the well meaning principles behind caring for others, along with the emphasis on social support for individuals who were in a tough spot or found themselves at a disadvantage. We wanted to express our solidarity. 
Can it be that that solidarity within the sphere of public authorities was transformed to self-reinforcing good deeds – that the more we believe that we need help, the more services that are provided – at the same time as those who seek help from society live under different conditions and values than before?
Tens of thousands of public employees spend their days dealing with integration issues, both on the micro- and macro-levels. Why then, is it so anxiety-ridden to talk about the unfortunate circumstances that actually exist? All these people sitting in meetings, participating in projects, getting paid for the work they do, going through training programmes and so on. Does it lead anywhere? Are Stockholm, Gothenburg, and Malmö less segregated cities today than they were 20 years ago?
By systematically dividing up the population, with immigrants as victims of a system created by the natives, a number of fictional clashes are created. These illusory elements are strengthened by the continuing emphasis that it’s the (media) portrayals of unacceptable conditions which are negative and not the conditions themselves. 
When the new district head of Rosengård in Malmö takes up her post and says that the most important thing is to change the area’s image, there is an immediate credibility problem: why devote so many resources to the people living there when it’s just like any other place?
And is the media portrayal worse than reality? Journalism is more likely to have a tendency to seek out bright spots expressly to avoid looking prejudiced. The current crop of bosses within Sweden’s social services took part in public debates when they were younger, but social workers have since remained silent for a long time about development conditions and power structures in troubled neighbourhoods. And when teachers in Malmö started speaking on the record last spring about inadequate teaching conditions, it was a long, pent up silence which finally broke.
After the death of solidarity, we’ve ended up with inflationary goodness rooted in a middle class, which never really needs to deal with the consequences of its moralizing view of those with bad experiences and therefore the wrong views. Structural benevolence dominates. But if people don’t get jobs, it’s often not because they immigrated, but because they lack the training and competence for the job in question.
“Ill fares the land” is the title of the last book that historian Tony Judt managed to publish before he died in early August in New York of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). It’s an educational plea for social democracy – a genuine social democracy – and a contemporary description of the left’s wandering out of the meaninglessness of identity politics. The title can also be give rise to a Swedish interpretation: “illfare” as opposed to “wellfare”; a society which gives up on notions of equality and bows to special demands and the rights of disparate groups.
With condescending tolerance and self-gratifying sophistication, a system has been created where both the takers and givers of social assistance can fully and completely assume their expected roles and in so doing ensure that nothing changes.

The truth, argues The Local's reporter Lee Roden, lies somewhere in the middle. 

	A recent article by Republican senator Tom Cotton and Republican congressman Mike Pompeo in the Wall Street Journal (“What We Learned in Scandinavia About Migrants”) opts for the latter stereotype. The basic premise of the piece is that Sweden has dealt horrifically with the refugee crisis, Norway has handled it perfectly, and that the USA should learn from that by listening to Donald Trump.

	Confused? You aren’t the only one. Fortunately, Cotton and Pompeo know Norway and Sweden inside out. After all, they “recently visited Norway and Sweden to understand more about the European migrant crisis”. And there was me thinking that the refugee crisis was a complex issue that requires more than a mere visit to adequately grasp (and in truth, probably isn’t fully grasped by most people who live here). The writers in question aren't the first to propagate such a simplistic view on Sweden, by the way, they just happen to be the most recent. 

	To quickly establish the Norway = good, Sweden = bad dichotomy, the piece wastes no time in creating a handy lists all of the things Norway has done well and that Sweden, conversely, has botched. The Norwegians built a border fence, reduced migrant benefits, and put out adverts in foreign countries warning people thinking of coming that they will be deported if they do not face war or persecution. All to much success, we are told.

	Sweden, meanwhile, “threw open its doors in 2013” (note the dramatic language here), bringing in migrants who are disproportionately poor (poor = bad), young (young = bad), undereducated (definitely bad, who deserves an education?) conservatively Muslim (in case you’re not on message yet, that’s bad too) and possess virtually no Swedish-language skills.

	No Swedish skills you say? On the bright side, that should help them integrate with large swathes of the British, Australian and, dare I say it, American community in Sweden.

	We’re then informed that this mass influx of refugees to Sweden and a lack of debate around the issue directly led to the rise of an “immigration-restrictionist” party (not anti-immigration, “immigration-restrictionist”), which in turn created a “hamstrung minority government” in 2014 when the left and right refused to work with them.

	If you blink you may miss it, but there’s a leap there that deserves some further inspection. Did a vacuum created by failing to listen to a broader range of views on immigration lead to the rise of the Sweden Democrats? Most likely. Did the success of the Sweden Democrats then create a “hamstrung minority government” in 2014? With more than two thirds of the post WWII governments in Sweden minority-led, the truth is that the current form of government is more akin to business as usual than a radical shift. Perhaps the writers missed that on their educational visit to Scandinavia.

	Sweden’s concession of implementing border controls is then mentioned, but strangely, these aren’t praised in the way that Norway’s were earlier in the piece, despite the number of refugees forecast to enter the country in 2016 recently being halved (which presumably would be seen as a positive by the authors). Instead, they move on to detail that seven percent of the 2016 Swedish budget will be allocated to “migrant services”, and that, terrifyingly, “no one knows where the new money will come from.”

	Less terrifying perhaps is that Sweden has just been named the sixth most competitive economy in the world (thanks in part to robust economic growth in 2016), or that it is comfortably outperforming European giants like Germany and Britain this year. Or that is experiencing the best economic growth in the Nordics (even better than those clever Norwegians, fences and all). Those points aren’t deemed relevant, because they don’t help illustrate the idea that Sweden is on the brink of financial turmoil because of the refugee crisis. No one knows where the new money will come from, remember.

	Putting flippancy aside, there’s a serious point to be made here about how time and time again people parachute into Sweden, stay a few days, then make broad conclusions about this for many foreign but vaguely recognizable place to suit their own agenda. Unfortunately, while it doesn’t necessarily make the best headlines, nor evoke the strongest emotions (and in the internet age, emotional reaction is king) the truth about Sweden almost always lies somewhere in the middle.

	Like any country coming to terms with a rapidly changing, increasingly global world, there are legitimate problems here. There are certainly legitimate challenges to be dealt with around immigration and the impact it is having on what until not so long ago was a largely monocultural society, too, but to reduce those issues to a few short paragraphs with little context then use that to make a partisan value judgment on the state of the place is dangerous.

	If you want to know what’s happening in Sweden, perhaps read The Local. We live here, we work here, we report here and at the minimum, we engage with people here. We don’t necessarily have all of the answers, but we’ll at least attempt to draw on our knowledge, the specialist knowledge of others, and provide some balance in our assessment of what is happening in this fascinating country. It deserves as much. Or rather, readers deserve as much.

					17:24 CET+01:00				", The Local,Police fail to show at Roma camp in Malmö,"
A controversial EU migrant camp in Malmö was due to be torn down at 4pm on Sunday but the eviction deadline passed without any sign of the police. 

	Despite the no-show from authorities, rumours circulated that the eviction would take place early on Monday morning.

	However, Lars Förstell, information director for Skåne police, told Swedish newspaper Aftonbladet, “I don't understand the word 'postpone'. 4pm was simply the earliest we could clear the camp. It is the municipality’s business and we will assist them should they require us.”

	The migrants have been living in tents, caravans, shacks and cars in an industrial area for months, sparking an intense debate in the city.

	According to Radio Sweden (Sveriges Radio) around half of those in the camp, approximately 75 people, had left by 3pm.

	But others refused to go and were joined in support by demonstrators outside the camp.

	Simona Tegman of the Network for Roma Rights (Nätverket romers rättigheter) told the Swedish news news agency, TT, “We want to have a peaceful demonstration, a sit-down.”

	Malmö is offering accommodation for five nights for around 50 people, said local councillor Carina Nilsson. The city is also trying to find help for the migrants in their home villages in Romania.

	Last Tuesday, Malmö’s environmental committee decided that the camp needed to be emptied and cleaned up and announced that residents had until 4pm today to either leave or face eviction by police.

	On Saturday, the Swedish government’s national coordinator for vulnerable EU citizens, Martin Valfridsson, told Sveriges Radio that there should be zero tolerance for those who camp on private or public property.

	“The state must support the municipalities in a very difficult situation,” Valfridsson said. “Police and private property owners have great difficulty with this situation. I think there should be zero tolerance for those who live without permission on all land in Sweden.”

	“You can’t give special treatment to any group in society,” he says. “We have no national roof-over-your-head guarantee. In large cities we even evict families with children who can’t pay their rent.”

	Under Swedish law both locals and visitors alike currently have the right to walk or camp on almost any land, although this does not include public land that is adjacent to residential property or privately-owned gardens.

	The case of the camp in Malmö is unique because the person who owns the land tolerated the migrants – who are mainly Roma people from Romania and Bulgaria – for six months before launching a trespassing case with police.

	Sweden's national government recently announced it was set to appoint an investigator to review the country's regulatory framework for eviction.

	Some municipalities in other parts of Sweden have already evicted groups of Roma from public land including in the capital, Stockholm.

The Swedish rescue ship Poseidon has helped another hundreds of migrants attempting to cross the Mediterranean, said the coast guard. 

	On Sunday Poseidon rescued a total of 321 migrants off the coast of Libya. The migrants who were picked up by the ship told the crew that they had been on rubber rafts for about eight hours. They included several children.

	The ship arrived in the Mediterranean in June as part of operation Triton, the EU's border rescue operation.

	In an interview with Swedish Radio ahead of the mission, commander Peo Allard said that the Swedes on board Poseidon had never undertaken a task quite like this one, which had involved both specific training and mental preparation.

	“They received information on why people are driven to flee,” he said.

	“The most difficult challenge will be meeting these overcrowded boats,” he added. “It’s a completely new kind of assignment for us, but something I have no doubt we can manage.”

	The Poseidon is kitted out with special equipment in order to take on a large number of migrants. The ship has portable toilets and private rooms for women and children. Sails have been put up to create shade for protection from the heat.

	The ship has brought a total of 3,966 people safely to Italy since it launched.

Saturday saw the launch of 'Malmedalen', a new political festival where Sweden's parties can reach out to people in one of Malmö's most segregated districts. 
We went along to see if it can work.  

	Outside the Social Democrat tent at the Malmedalen political festival, city councillor Sedat Arif is fighting for the votes of four young locals. 

	 

	""When we came to Sweden we had all these advantages,"" he says. ""And we want our children to have them too. Should they have good schools or not? Or should schools be run by people who cheat and send all their money to tax havens?"" 

	 

	Hussein Abdulzahra, 22, nods appreciatively, and explains to Arif about how his ""very good"" local school in the area got him into the KTH Royal Institute of Technology, one of Sweden's top universities. 

	 

	Abdulzahra who grew up in the tower block which overlooks the park where the event is being held,

	says he's impressed at the attempt to reach voters in Rosengård, one of Malmö's most troubled districts. 

	 

	""It's quite positive, because there's not a lot of people around here who would have the courage to go somewhere else to find out about the political parties,"" Abdulzahra says.  

	 

	He's been visiting the stands of the Social Democrats and the centre-right Moderate party, and ignoring the others, ""because whatever they do, the others are going to say the same"". 

	 

	Malmedalen is the creation of Christian Glasnovic, a Malmö social entrepreneur who grew so frustrated with Almedalen, Sweden's giant political jamboree on the island of Gotland, that he decided to set up a rival in this heavily segregated area. 

	 

	""Almedalen is not for us, not for ordinary people,"" Glasnovic complains. ""I think this will bring people knowledge about democracy and the election, about what every participating party talks about. Right now I don't think they have much knowledge. That's why we're starting this project.""

	On the festival's second day, it's a partial success. The seven parliamentary political parties have all set up tents, as has the Feminist Initiative. 

	 

	On stage, Malmö's orthodox Rabbi Moshe David HaCohen and Salahuddin Barakat, a local imam, are being interviewed about their project to fight anti-Semitism in the city. 

	 

	The festival has also drawn some major figures: Foreign Minister Margot Wallström is coming for the Social Democrats, as is Gustav Fridolin, Education Minister and Green Party spokesman, and Mattias Karlsson, group leader of the anti-immigration Sweden Democrats. 

	 

	""I think we've reached people that we normally haven't been able to reach,"" says the Social Democrats' Arif. ""Not to as big an extent as I would've wanted, but this the first year that this has been around and it will take time for those that are running this to think about what people need.""

	On Sunday, the day given over to the Centre Party, the Rosengård locals are probably outnumbered by those representing the political parties. Glasnovic estimates that 500-600 people have come a day so far, with more expected on days when the high-profile speakers visit.

	 

	Charlotte Bossen, second on the Centre Party's candidate list for Malmö City Council, is upbeat. 

	 

	""I think it's a start, because it's the first time ever that they've had Malmedalen,"" she says. As for the Centre Party's sparsely attended talks, she shrugs. ""I think it's about democracy. I think it's important that the party goes out to the people."" 

	 

	The anti-immigration Sweden Democrats' tent by the entrance is, perhaps surprisingly, one of the busiest.

	 

	Some local youth come to try and out-debate a party they see as an enemy, but other older immigrants listen approvingly as the party's representatives outlines their strict policies on law and order and education. 

	 

	""What sort of punishment do you think is best for families who do not keep their children under control?"" one Arab man asks city councillor Jörgen Grubb, after listening to him explain the party's ideas to combat a lack of discipline in schools. 

	 

	Abdulzahra says that after hearing the Moderates' arguments, he's been convinced to stick with the Social Democrats. 

	 

	""If they lower taxes, it won't make any difference to me, because these tax changes aren't for low-income civilians,"" he says. ""And if they lower tax, it's going to be more expensive for me to go to hospital and things.""

The Council of Europe's rights commissioner has urged Sweden to reverse restrictions imposed on asylum seekers when it reviews its temporary law in 2018. 

	While commending Sweden's efforts to help asylum seekers and refugees, particularly at the peak of arrivals in 2015, the Commissioner for Human Rights Nils Muiznieks said in a report he was ""concerned at the restrictions introduced"".

	Sweden has registered around 400,000 asylum requests since 2012, or one for every 25 inhabitants, a record in Europe.

	Asylum applications, a third of which were from Syrians, hit a peak of 163,000 in 2015.

	But to stem the influx of people and ease the strain on accommodation centres, migration offices and social affairs, Sweden in January 2016 reintroduced systematic identity checks on its border with Denmark, as well as a series of restrictions aimed at deterring other migrants.

	Muiznieks said he was ""notably concerned at the impact"" of an amended law that enables Swedish authorities to deprive rejected asylum seekers – who have no children with them and must leave the country – of accommodation, allowance and subsidized medical care.

	He also expressed worries over restrictions on the right to family reunifications.

	""The Commissioner urges the Swedish authorities to ensure that refugees and other beneficiaries of international protection fully enjoy their right to family reunification and expresses the hope that the restrictions to the right to family reunification in particular will be lifted on the occasion of the mid-review of the temporary law in 2018,"" the 29-page report said.

'Benefit of the doubt'

	In 2015, one in five asylum seekers applied as unaccompanied minors, many of whom where from Afghanistan.

	To determine the age of young applicants arriving without identification papers, the Swedish Migration Agency has since May 2017 introduced voluntary dental X-rays and magnetic resonance imaging of the knee joints.

	Muiznieks called on Swedish authorities ""not to rely only on a medical assessment of age"" and ""to ensure that minors are always given the benefit of the doubt where there is uncertainty as to their age"".

	The commissioner cited a report by the UN Committee on the Right of the Child which found such medical exams had ""wide margins of error"".

	Meanwhile, the report noted Sweden was ""close to achieving its commitment"" of taking in 3,766 migrants in 2017 under relocation quotas set between EU member states.

	The country has also promised to welcome 5,000 migrants this year under the EU quota.

The homeless migrant who was murdered earlier this month has been identified as a 48-year-old man from Romania known as ‘Gica'.  

	Friends of Gica, whose real name was Gheorge Hortolomei-Lupu, are speaking out after a teenage boy was arrested on Monday in connection with his death. 

	 

	Iréne Linddahl, who works for local aid group Kyrkhjälpen, said she first met Gica four years ago when he came to a party hosted by her group in Huskvarna. He became regularly involved with Kyrkhjälpen's efforts to help other homeless EU migrants in Sweden. 

	 

	“He was friendly, grateful and kind,” Linddahl told Aftonbladet. “He lived outdoors and primarily devoted himself to begging.” 

	 

	Gica's body was discovered in a Huskvarna park earlier this month but it took police a week to determine that a murder had occurred. The police investigation then led to the teenager who was arrested on Monday. Police have also questioned two other boys in connection with the crime. Both are under the age of 15 and one is as young as 13 according to P4 Jönköping. One of the boys is suspected of assaulting the migrant on the same day as the alleged murder while the other is suspected of harassing the victim.

	Mikael Good, a volunteer who helped the homeless and other down-on-their-luck people in Huskvarna, also fondly remembered Gica and said he couldn't think of any reason anyone would want to hurt him. 

	 

	“I was completely destroyed [by the news]. I cannot understand why anyone would do this to a weak person who couldn't defend himself,” Good told Aftonbladet. 

	 

	Both Good and Linddahl said that Gica's health had taken a serious turn in recent months and that he had lost a great deal of weight and had difficulty getting around. 

	 

	According to Linddahl, Gica came to Sweden roughly four years ago from a town near Bacau in Romania. He reportedly lost his job at a printing company and got divorced shortly thereafter. This upending of his life led him to leave Romania. He spent time in several other EU countries before settling in Sweden. 

	 

	""He probably thought people were nice here and that he had found a beautiful spot overlooking the lake and the mountains,"" Good said. 

	 

	He worked in the Huskvarna area as a fruit picker for awhile before becoming a bottle collector and full-time beggar. 

	 

	Kyrkhjälpen held a memorial for Gica that was attended by roughly 50 people, including a number of other Romanians and local Huskvarna residents.

	Officers rounded up 14 people on Monday night in cars close to the asylum accommodation that is thought to have been the intended target of the plot.

	 

	Batons, knives, iron bars and axes were found in the suspects' vehicles.

	 

	Hesam Akbari, a spokesperson for Stockholm police, told the TT news agency that members of the group were facing a number of charges.

	The Aftonbladet daily reported that some of the suspects were living and working in Sweden.

	Swedish officials recently have called for stepped-up security at asylum accommodation across the country after an employee at a centre for unaccompanied child refugees was fatally stabbed in January.

	 

	However news of the alleged plot emerged as police appeared to make efforts to calm far-right sentiment in the country by releasing statistics which suggest that less than one percent of crimes in Sweden are linked to refugees.

A new proposal given to the Swedish government suggests that labour migrants should be able to ask for compensation from their employer if they are denied a residence permit due to the employer's error. 

	The proposal is part of a government commissioned inquiry into how Sweden's much-criticized deportations of non-EU workers over minor bureaucratic mistakes could be addressed.

	The investigation suggests that if a residence permit is revoked ""because the employer has failed to give the worker employment which fulfills the requirements for a work permit, the employer should pay out compensation"".

	The same should be possible if an employer is not able to extend their residence permit or acquire a permanent residence permit because of a breech of the conditions by their employer.

	The Local contacted Sweden's Migration Minister Heléne Fritzon seeking comment and more details from the proposal, but her press spokesperson said that the minister could not say any more as she is currently analyzing the proposal, referring to an interview previously given to Dagens Nyheter (DN).

	""Small mistakes from employers should not lead to someone being caught in a situation where they are deported because an employer has not fulfilled the terms of employment. In such cases there should be the possibility of some form of sanction,"" Fritzon told DN.

	However it is not clear if immigrants awarded compensation would still be deported from Sweden anyway – the main issue that those impacted by Sweden's strict rules in the area are complaining about.

	Reactions to the proposal from Swedish business organizations have been negative. Employers' association Almega called it ""misguided"" and said it would not stop deportations, while the Confederation of Swedish Enterprise said the real problem is that the rules over work permits are not clear enough.

	The inquiry report will now be submitted to relevant agencies and organizations for their comments on the suggestions, after which the government will decide whether or not to move forward with the proposal.

	Just before the discovery of the bodies, the Poseidon had picked up 130 migrants from a rubber dinghy, Lindholm said.

	""All countries have to follow the joint rules, otherwise they can't be members. I will summon the Hungarian ambassador next week and convey this,"" Johansson said.

Norway has announced it is going to start turning back refugees without visas arriving from elsewhere in the passport-free Schengen zone, particularly Sweden. 

	The move is part of a draft law containing a series of immigration measures that Norway's government says will make its asylum policy ""one of Europe's toughest"".

	The conservative minority last month gathered enough parliamentary support from the centre and labour parties to adopt the measures.

	Norway does not belong to the EU but it is, like Sweden, a member of the Schengen area which has no passport or immigration controls.

	According to Schengen rules, asylum seekers must apply for a visa in the country they first arrive in, mostly Italy and Greece. But many instead move on to the country they want to eventually settle in, often in Europe's richer north.

	In recent years, Sweden has been a favourite destination for refugees and is known for being more tolerant and open than its Scandinavian neighbours. But the number of asylum seekers has dropped by a third in recent weeks, after the Nordic nation tightened border controls amid a shortage of accommodation for new arrivals.

Thousands of newcomers to Sweden risk becoming homeless in Sweden in spring next year, as many municipalities are struggling to find housing for new arrivals.  

	Those people with short-term employment contracts are at greatest risk of losing their home, according to Sveriges Radio Ekot.

	Since March 2016, Sweden's municipalities have been tasked with providing accommodation for some 60,000 new arrivals to the country who had been granted asylum.

	This was part of the Settlement Act, introduced as a response to the huge numbers of refugees, and although there's no official deadline written into Swedish law, most municipalities linked it to the Establishment Agreement, a two-year period during which new arrivals are entitled to free Swedish language and job preparation classes.

	This means that in March next year, the first of these housing contracts will expire, raising the question of where their inhabitants – an estimated 15,000 people – will live after that deadline. The situation will be particularly difficult for those not in employment when the contract expires.

	""My view is that all municipalities are facing the same problem. There are relatively few [new arrivals] who have managed to get their own homes,"" Jesper Schönberg from Haninge municipality told Sveriges Radio.

	According Per-Arne Andersson, Head of the Education and Labor Department at Sweden's Municipalities and County Council (SKL), around 100,000 people will be in need of housing in 2018, including the 60,000 already covered by the Settlement Act as well as those who are moved from Migration Agency facilities this year and the next, after having asylum applications approved.

	About 50 to 60 percent of the municipalities say that they are in a good position to manage the housing situation, Andersson told TT, but the others have reported ""great difficulties"".

	The majority of Swedish municipalities were facing a housing shortage before the 2015 migration crisis, with only one municipality saying that it had a surplus of housing in 2017.

Age tests carried out on migrants to determine whether they were over 18 may have been inaccurate in many cases, according to a new study published in a medical journal. 

	Researchers found that of those tested, migrant children were far more likely to be misclassified as adults than vice versa, the findings published in the International Journal of Legal Medicine by scientists at the Chalmers technical university of Gothenburg show.

	The Swedish government ordered the national forensic medicine agency (Rättsmedicinalverket) to start carrying out medical age tests in 2017 after doubts were raised over whether all those who were being processed as minors were in fact underage.

	Age was crucial in determining how the asylum seekers' applications were processed, as unaccompanied minors can only be returned to their home countries if they have a family member or other guardian who can provide them with somewhere to live.

	The tests included X-rays of wisdom teeth, and MRI scans of knee joints, which are then analyzed by dentists and radiologists. However, the Gothenburg scientists behind the new study say that the combined method of teeth and knee tests were never tested for reliability, for example by testing the measures on people whose ages were known.

	In total, 9,617 men and 337 women underwent the tests in 2017, and according to the study, an estimated 15 percent of the males were under 18 years old. These children faced a 33 percent chance of being classified as adults, whereas adult men faced a seven percent likelihood of being classified as children.

	There are several reasons why the age of those who arrive in Sweden might be unclear, which is why the tests were called for.

	Many of the asylum seekers who arrived in Sweden between 2014 and 2016 lack identity documents, with many coming from unstable regions where they may have lost many of their belongings. Another factor is that their countries of origin often do not have the same structures in place to record birthdates as Sweden does, so it's not unusual for people not to know their exact age.

The Danish National Police said on Thursday that  arriving refugees and migrants will now be allowed to pass through Denmark on the way to Sweden.  

	Explaining that there are only “limited opportunities to detain foreigners who come to the country”, the Danish National Police (Rigspolitiet) announced that officers will no longer attempt to stop arriving refugees and migrants from leaving Denmark if they don’t wish to formally seek asylum. 

	 

	“This is a police decision built on the options that are allowed under the law and on our obligations. We can not hold foreigners who don’t seek asylum and who can’t be sent out [of the country] quickly again,” National Police Chief Jens Henrik Højberg said in a statement. 

	 

	Højberg said that that refugees and migrants who do want to seek asylum in Denmark will be processed and transferred to local immigration authorities. 

	 

	However, the Danish Justice Ministry added that just 400 of the estimated 3,200 refugees and migrants who have arrived in Denmark since Sunday afternoon have applied for asylum. Prime Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen put the number at 668 later on Thursday. 

	 

	""The large majority of the arrivals [...] have refused to communicate with Danish authorities. Most of those who have had contact with the Danish police have stated that they want to go to Sweden to claim asylum,"" a ministry statement read. 

	 

	After days of trying to register the arrivals and house them in temporary quarters, the Danish National Police explained that it can no longer try to keep the refugees in Denmark. 

	 

	“We can obviously not detain so many people indefinitely. Therefore there are no other options than to let them go. And with that, we cannot keep them from going wherever they want,” Højberg said. 

	 

	As of Thursday morning, trains arriving in both the harbour town of Rødby and the southern Jutland town of Padborg were being allowed to continue on toward Copenhagen, the jumping-off point for crossings by bus, train or car to Sweden.

	 

	Police have also reportedly allowed citizens to drive refugees to Sweden by car, a practice that earlier in the week led to a handful of arrests. 

	 

	Officers said that most of the arriving refugees and migrants were actively avoiding any contact with the Danish police in an effort to not be registered in Denmark.

	 

	“We have a very difficult task handling all of those who enter – especially because most of them do not want to contact us and be registered. We are talking about people, families and children, who have been travelling a long time from conflict areas, and Danish police are doing a lot to deal with this situation peacefully, using dialogue and patience,” National Police Commissioner Svend Larsen said in a separate statement. 

	 

	Sweden, one of many European countries struggling with the worst migration crisis since World War Two, has become a top EU destination for refugees by issuing permanent residency to all Syrian asylum seekers since 2013.

	 

	In contrast, Denmark has sought to reduce the influx by issuing temporary residence permits, delaying family reunions and slashing benefits for newly arrived immigrants. The Danish government has publicized those policies through an international advertising campaign. 

	 

	Swedish officials said on Thursday that 322 refugees have crossed over from Denmark since Monday.

	 

	Danish Prime Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen has called for a meeting with the leaders of parliament’s political parties later on Thursday to discuss the government’s position on the refugee influx. 

	 


		Swedish Prime Minister Stefan Löfven meanwhile has called for Sweden’s entire public sector to unite to ensure the swift resettlement of the latest influx of refugees.

Sweden issued a record number of residence permits in 2012, with the total tally ending up at 110,000, a 19-percent hike from 2011 with refugees accounting for the bulk of the increase, statistics from the Swedish Migration Board (Migrationsverket) show. 

As a group, people in need of protection (skyddsbehövande) saw the biggest increase, with 37 percent more applications being approved in 2012 compared to 2011.
Almost 4,600 people arrived in Sweden per month in the latter part of year, accelerated in large part by the civil war in Syria.
There were more than 7,000 applications from Syrians, of which about 5,000 were granted. 
In total, Syrians stood for 18 percent of all applications, with Somalis and Afghans at 13 and 11 percent respectively. They together formed the majority of asylum seekers to Sweden.
Migration Board head Anders Danielsson thinks the authorities still manage to treat all applications fairly.
""But our resources are under a lot of pressure,"" he told the TT news agency. 
The authorities sped up the time it took to process applications for unaccompanied minors who sought asylum (ensamkommande flyktingbarn). It now takes on average 108 instead of 149 days to get a decision.
Afghanistan is the country of origin of most of the unaccompanied minors, although the authorities noted a rise in young migrants from previously less-represented countries such as Algeria, Morocco, Uganda and Syria.
Almost 3,600 children and teens sought asylum in 2012, a 35-percent increase from the year before. 
Sweden grants residence to the highest number of underage asylum seekers in Europe.
The Swedish authorities also noted a rise of applications from the Western Balkan nations. Serbia stood for more than half, trailed by Bosnia & Herzegovina and Albania, with migrants leaving for ""socio-economic reasons"", the Migration Board noted.
The total number of asylum applications clocks in at 44,000. In comparison, Germany went through 64,000 asylum applications in 2012 while France processed 60,000. 
People coming to Sweden to join relatives made up the biggest group of new residents - 41,000 applications were granted, up by 27 percent from the previous year. 
A court decision from the Migration Court in January 2012 also set a legal precedent and opened the door for more relatives to join their families. It affected mostly the Swedish-Somali community but migrants from Thailand, Iraq and Serbia also dominated the applications. 
About 8,000 people were granted residency permits because a member of their family was either an asylum seeker or needed special protection. The majority were Somalis.  
Family members joining people who work in Sweden increased to 9,700 from 8,200 the year before. India, Syria and China were highly represented in the statistics. 
And about 17,000 working permits were granted to citizens of non-EU countries.  
The Migration Board noted that IT workers from India and China were the second biggest group, trumped only by seasonal berrypickers from Thailand. 
 
From outside the EU, 7,000 new foreign students arrived in Sweden in 2012, almost half compared to two years ago because of the introduction of university fees for non-EU students, the Migration Board noted.
Chinese students are the most numerous, followed by Turkey, the US, Australia, and India. 
EU students instead increased by 68 percent to 3,500 students, most of them from Germany, France and Spain.

Sweden's decision to take in more asylum seekers per capita than any other EU nation remained in focus on Wednesday as the European Commission formally presented its plan for member states to share responsibility for refugees fleeing the Middle East and Africa. 

	Asylum figures by the EU's statistics watchdog Eurostat this week confirmed that Sweden is continuing to take in a bigger share of asylum seekers than any other member state, when compared to existing population size.

	 

	Around 9.6 million people live in the Nordic nation and asylum was granted to more than 33,000 refugees last year.

	 

	This means that for every one million people in Sweden, the Nordic nation took in 3,424 asylum seekers in 2014.

	 

	By contrast, Germany took in 589 per one million, while for the UK the figure was just 218.

	 

	Sweden's rate of acceptance was also the highest in the EU.

	 

	77 percent of applicants were granted protection in their first attempt and 18 percent of appeals received positive decisions in 2014.

	 

	In Germany, 42 percent of applicants got asylum on their first attempt and 16 percent of appeals were successful.

	 

	The figures emerged as the European Commission - the part of the EU that thinks up EU policies to be voted on by national leaders and MEPs - revealed its full proposals for addressing the influx of migrants seeking to reach the continent.

	 

	The key points from the plan had previously been leaked, as The Local reported on Tuesday.

		In its report, the Commission said it planned to beef up European border controls and introduce quotas for the number of migrants each country should take in, seen as a way of more fairly sharing responsibility for refugees.

		 

		""The plight of thousands of migrants putting their lives in peril to cross the Mediterranean has shocked.

		 

		""It is clear that no EU country can or should be left alone to address huge migratory pressures,"" the Commission wrote in its report. 

		 

		Sweden's Justice and Migration Minister Morgan Johansson is a strong supporter of the proposed quota system.

		 

		“Our Common European Asylum System is not very common in a situation where a handful of Member States are taking the responsibility for over 90 percent of the asylum seekers,” he told The Local on Monday after the Commisson's plans were leaked.

		 

		“For the Common European Asylum System to be sustainable in the long run, a more even distribution of asylum seekers within the EU is needed,” he added.

		 

		The Commission's report comes amid ongoing concern about growing numbers of refugees, especially from war-torn countries like Syria risking their lives to get to the Europe. Over the past few weeks, hundreds have died attempting to cross the Mediterranean Sea by boat.

Sweden’s national job agency has sacked its whole network of immigrant resettlement assistants after suspicion that some of them may have tried to recruit newly arrived immigrants to jihadist-style militant groups, such as Isis. 
  “We have received indication that there have been instances of recruitment attempts or contact-making situations related to various militant fighting groups,” the head of the agency, Mikael Sjöberg, said of the decision to immediately fire all of its resettlement assistants.   The Swedish intelligence service, Säpo, is now investigating the case, he said.   Although the agency would not name the suspected groups the agents recruited for, a source told Swedish tabloid Expressen that militant Islamist group Isis is thought to be among them.   The role of the agency’s resettlement assistants was to help newly arrived migrants find work by assisting them with, for example, the language or helping them with paperwork.
  Some of the assistants are also suspected of having been involved in fraudulent activities and pressing people for bribes in order to help them.   “It’s to do with loans or gifts, like tablets, mobile phones and sometimes cash, in order to get connected to a specific assistant,” he was quoted as saying to Expressen.   Last month, the national intelligence service confirmed that at least 100 Swedes have fought alongside Islamist extremists in Iraq and Syria.

The movement of people across borders is a powerful engine for growth, putting pressure on policy makers worldwide to compete to attract talent, argue government ministers Gunilla Karlsson and Tobias Billstrom. 

Day after day, media reports and our minds are filled with the plight of people fleeing - be it from war, conflict, hunger or threat.
But there is another side to people's mobility. Of the world's approximately 900 million migrants, it is estimated that more than 90 percent move in search of better jobs and other opportunities. 
The movement of people across borders and labour markets is a powerful engine for growth and development. As ministers responsible for migration and development cooperation, we want to promote this form of mobility.
Two months ago, Sweden assumed the chairmanship of the Global Forum on Migration and Development (GFMD), a leading arena for discussion of global migration issues. 
At the same time, work is also under way on the post 2015 development agenda that will carry forward the work begun with the current Millennium Development Goals. The work includes an important discussion on how migration can be used to increase freedom and eradicate poverty. 
Today, we are jointly hosting a seminar on the impact of migration on global development, at which some of the world's foremost experts in the area will be discussing this issue.
A very concrete example of how migration drives development is the billions of dollars in remittances that migrants from low-income countries send home to their families around the world. Every year, millions of people move to work in countries where wages are higher than in their home countries, sending money home to their relatives. 
The World Bank estimates that these financial flows amounted to $400 billion last year, and they are expected to rise by about 7 percent per year in the years ahead. They represent the second-largest source of financial flows to low- and middle-income countries.
These remittances are three times the size of international development assistance and in some countries they account for a large share of the total GDP. This money gives many families in the migrants' home countries the chance to go to better schools, get enough to eat and enjoy a better life.
How can we ensure that financial flows such as these function as smoothly as possible and benefit people living in poverty in the best possible way? We hope to be able to achieve better solutions through the Global Forum on Migration and Development.
Migration is a means to achieve not only economic development but also improved social development. We have both met colleagues from other countries who have expressed their concern about seeing more and more young and educated people moving to other countries in search of a better life. 
Around the world, people are moving from societies where the environment prevents them from reaching their full potentials, to countries where better policies have led to better conditions. 
Migration puts pressure on policy makers worldwide, who are forced to compete to entice talented people to remain within the country's borders.
When people migrate, new ideas and thoughts can move across borders, compete with each other and find new platforms. Entrepreneurs from different countries can meet and learn from each other.
There are many examples of people who did not find the right environment for innovation in their countries of birth, but who could accomplish great things when they were able to test their ideas in new countries.
Around the world, many countries are choosing to close their borders more tightly, both to keep citizens in and to keep others out. But countries can cooperate and solve the challenges that may arise as a result of migration and lack of development. 
Forums like the GFMD, which Sweden is now chairing, play a key role in this kind of cooperation. It is essential, both for our sake and for the rest of the world.

The number of asylum seekers arriving in southern Sweden from Denmark dropped sharply on the first day that Sweden imposed systematic ID checks on travellers, police said on Tuesday. 

	Police in the southern Swedish region of Skåne said they had registered just 48 migrants arriving in Sweden on Monday. Excluding New Year's Day, there had been at least 200 per day since December 29th.

	 

	""One can say that it's a sharp drop. But it's only been one day (since the controls were introduced), and we can't exclude that refugees will find other ways of entering Sweden,"" police spokeswoman Ewa-Gun Westford said.

	 

	Sweden – which has taken in more asylum seekers per capita than any other EU nation – recently said it could no longer cope with the unregulated flow of arrivals.

	 

	In a bid to stem the influx, it has since Monday required all travellers to show photo identification when entering from Denmark, the main entry point for refugees hoping to start a new life in Sweden.

	 

	The Swedish coast guard said it was prepared for the possibility that migrants may now try to clandestinely cross the Öresund strait that divides Denmark and Sweden.

	 

	""We have to be prepared for the fact that people may seek other routes than the (Öresund) bridge or ferries, regardless of whether it is a Danish network behind this or individual initiatives,"" coast guard spokesman Mattias Lindholm told news agency TT.

	 

	Sweden has yet to officially register any migrants arriving on clandestine boats across the Baltic.

	 

	An inflatable dinghy discovered in early December on the shores of the southern town of Skillinge raised suspicions of such a crossing, but border police said it was ""very unlikely"" the boat had been used to such ends.

	 

	Sweden, a country of 9.8 million inhabitants, received 163,000 asylum applications last year.

	 

	More than one million migrants reached Europe in 2015, most of whom were refugees fleeing war and violence in Syria, Afghanistan and Iraq, according to the United Nations refugee agency.

The Swedish coast guard ship Poseidon has arrived in the Mediterranean and on Monday begins taking part in operation Triton, the EU's border rescue operation. Poseidon's mission is to save the lives of migrants trying to get to Europe.  

	Sweden’s participation in operation Triton comes as the Mediterranean migrant crisis reaches new heights. More than 5,000 people trying to reach Europe have been saved from boats in distress in the Mediterranean since Friday and operations are currently underway to rescue another 500, European Union authorities said on Sunday.

	In an interview with Swedish Radio, commander Peo Allard said that the Swedes on board Poseidon had never undertaken a mission quite like this one, but had been trained and mentally prepared at home.

	“They received information on why people are driven to flee,” he said.

	“The most difficult challenge will be meeting these overcrowded boats,” he added. “It’s a completely new kind of assignment for us, but something I have no doubt we can manage.”

	The Poseidon has been kitted out with special equipment in order to take on a large number of migrants. The ship has portable toilets and private rooms for women and children. Sails have been put up to create shade for protection from the Mediterranean heat.

	The Swedish government announced more than a month ago that it was prepared to send surveillance ships to the Mediterranean as the humanitarian crisis there continued to grow.

	Before the Poseidon set out on its mission from Gothenburg on May 21st, Home Affairs Minister Anders Ygeman spoke of what motivated the government to participate.

	“It is the suffering we are seeing in the Mediterranean where thousands of people risk their lives in flimsy vessels,” he said.

	“It was obvious to the government that Sweden should help.”

	Sweden sent planes and ships to the Mediterranean in 2009, 2010 and 2013 to help spot migrant boats and has contributed twice to the anti-pirate mission Atalanta off the coast of Somalia.

	Operation Triton is being run by Frontex, an EU agency that manages cooperation between national border protection agencies to cut down on illegal immigration and human trafficking.

	Sweden will participate in operation Triton until the end of August.

A Syrian comedian who suggested asylum seekers should stop travelling to Sweden, has told The Local he's been threatened on social media and didn't mean to come across as so critical. But he explained he does have concerns about his adopted home. 

	Syrian YouTube star and asylum seeker Mahmoud Bitar spent three years trying to move to Sweden, bouncing between different countries in the Middle East after fleeing violence in his home city Aleppo, before travelling by boat to Greece and then heading north to Scandinavia.

	 

	He documented some of his journey on Instagram, where he has almost 60,000 followers, and went on to make YouTube videos in Arabic joking about life in Sweden once he finally arrived at his dream destination.

	 

	But the social media fan, who describes himself as a ""fun comedian"", was virtually unheard of among non-Arabic speakers until earlier this week, when the BBC posted a video in which the refugee is seen telling viewers in English ""don't come to Sweden - or at least think carefully about it"".

	 

	Bitar explains that many Syrians have unrealistic expectations about life in the Nordics, assuming they will get access to large homes and cars. He jokes that in reality life can be boring and immigrants are often forced to rely on government handouts and loans from friends.

	 

	His comments have since gone viral, with the video picked up by news networks in Sweden and shared widely on social media.

	""There has been a lot of reaction from people. We have had positive and negative comments,"" he told The Local on Thursday afternoon, adding that many of the messages he had received had been threatening.

	 

	""I love Sweden and there has been some misunderstanding,"" he explained.

	 

	""I said you should think carefully if you are going to live in Sweden because you must be hardworking. The BBC cut that last bit out.""

	 

	He added: ""There are some people, some people...maybe ten percent...who think if they come to Sweden everything will be easy and free and that is what I told them. That idea is not true. You have to work here. All the refugees must be hardworking,"" he added in Arabic, with his comments translated into English by his manager Dr Majd Abdulghani.

	 

	Asked if he had in fact revised his comments slightly for fear of further reprisals or being sent back to his home country, he said: ""Well there have been some bad comments and I am still afraid. That is why I want to send a message now to the Swedish government to get an ID or a permit. If I get one then I can work here. This is my choice, to be in Sweden now.""

	The Swedish Migration Board (Migrationsverket) does not comment on individual cases, but according to Bitar, he can expect to wait up to a year before he is given a personal number, which he needs before he can get a job in Sweden.

	 

	""I had an interview [with Migrationsverket] and then I was told I would have to wait another seven months so in total it will be a year. In the meantime I cannot get work or study,"" he told The Local, adding that he was currently living on 1800 kronor ($211) a month from the Swedish government, as well as hand-outs from friends.

	 

	There signs that some Syrian refugees are already starting to shun Sweden -- which has a global reputation for openness and tolerance -- as news spreads about long processing times for asylum applications. 

	 

	The Nordic nation currently takes in more refugees per capita than any other EU country, but a report by Sweden's Migration Board (Migrationsverket) last month suggested that the number of predicted asylum seekers in 2015 would be around 74,000, compared to the 90,000 it suggested in February.

	 

	""Yes, many Syrians have heard bad news about Sweden recently. They know it will take a long time [to secure a residency permit]. This is putting them off coming,"" confirmed Bitar.

	 

	""'We don't prefer Sweden any more', it is true that is what people have said,"" he added.

	 

	But Bitar insisted that he had no regrets about his decision to move to Borås, a small city in the south west of the country.

	 

	""I am free now. This country respects humans. I enjoy the nature and the water and gardens. There is good sightseeing here and it is very safe in Sweden,"" he said.

Sweden's defence minister has said saving lives is more important than her EU colleagues' fear of ""sending migrants the wrong signals"", and will send a surveillance plane to the Mediterranean. 
  ""For us, it is important to save lives, and that has to come first,"" Defence Minister Karin Enström told Sveriges Radio (SR) on Thursday.   While migrants faring ill at sea is not news, the death of some 300 people after they accidentally set fire to their capsizing ship brought the issue to light once again. The Swedish government's statement on Thursday specifically mentioned the incident as it announced the Swedish coast guard's upcoming mission.   It will not be the first time the Swedes aid an international mission at sea. The coast guard has taken part in Mediterranean operations in 2009 and in 2010, and have contributed twice to the anti-pirate mission Atalanta off Somalia. The Swedes have also done fishing industry checks and environmental assignments at sea.   ""This airplane has a very good capacity to, from a high altitude, survey expansive areas and discover very small boats at sea,"" Enström explained. ""In these cases, one imagines being able to see very small over-loaded boats, and not just see that there is a boat but get an idea of conditions on board.""   The plane will be offered to the European frontier agency Frontex, a Warsaw-based outfit of the union that has come under severe criticism since its inception seven years ago for lack of transparency.
  ""The worries regarding the need to keep this agency accountable are particularly marked due to the proximity of its field of action with human and protection rights related issues,"" PhD candidate Leila Giannetto at Trento University summarized last year.   Frontex in January put out a tender for ""optionally-piloted aircraft"", in essence saying it was ready to use drones to police the frontiers. The official aim was to ""identify more cost-efficient and operationally effective solutions for aerial border surveillance that could be used in Frontex joint operations"".   ""For two weeks during July the company and unknown subcontractors will provide an optionally-piloted aircraft and accompanying ground station as part of Frontex's ""Aerial Border Surveillance Trial 2013"","" the civil liberties watchdog StateWatch reported earlier this year.

UPDATED: Around 40 Roma migrants forced to leave a shanty camp for health and safety reasons spent the night outside Malmö city hall and said they planned to continue protesting against the decision. 

	The migrants were among around 200 people - mostly Roma people from Romania and Bulgaria - who had been staying at a controversial shanty town in an industrial area of Sweden’s third largest city.

	The camp was cleared on Tuesday amid concerns that it posed a health risk both to those staying there and neighbouring residents.

	Dozens of campaigners joined a group of the migrants in protesting late into the night outside Malmö city hall, with around 40 Roma people subsequently sleeping on mattresses and rugs outside the building.

	Police have told Swedish media that they are currently categorizing the migrants’ activities as a peaceful “demonstration” and are therefore taking no action. However this could change if the mood becomes violent or if the protesters set up shelters and tents in the area.

	“It has been a cold night outside city hall,” said Johanna Stenberg, a reporter for Swedish public broadcaster SVT, on Wednesday morning.

	“Most people tell me that they intend to stay as long as possible in protest (…) despair is great here.”

	The migrants are legally allowed to stay in Sweden as they are EU residents. Sweden’s Prime Minister Stefan Löfven joined the debate on Tuesday, arguing that the responsibility for ensuring that they had roofs over their heads remained with Romania and Bulgaria, where most of them are from.

	""They are of course welcome to come here and spend some time here, but in the long run their own countries have to ensure they get work, education and a place to live in their country,"" the Social Democrat leader told the TT news agency.

	Malmö Mayor Katrin Stjernfeldt Jammeh, also of the centre-left Social Democrats, echoed his comments.

	""Of course it's a tough situation for those who today don't really know where they will go. We can offer evacuation homes and support to help them return to Romania,"" she said.

	Stjernfeldt Jammeh told TT later on Tuesday that around 40 people from the closed camp had chosen to stay in emergency accommodation being provided by the local authority for five nights, while around 20 had decided to go back to their own country.

	“We’re doing individual assessments, but it is likely that those who want it [help to return home] will get it,” she said.

	Under Swedish law, locals and visitors alike usually have the right to walk or camp on almost any land, although this does not include public land that is adjacent to residential property or privately-owned gardens.

	The case of the camp in Malmö is unique because the person who owns the land tolerated the migrants for six months before launching a trespassing case with police.

	Sweden's national government recently announced it was set to appoint an investigator to review the country's regulatory framework for eviction.

A new poll suggests growing numbers of Swedes want their country to take in fewer migrants, as the nation continues to welcome an unprecedented influx of asylum seekers. 

	The poll by Sifo, published in the Svenska Dagbladet newspaper, found 41 percent of respondents said Sweden should grant fewer residency permits to refugees -- compared to just 29 percent in September.

	Of the 1,000 people questioned between November 2nd and 5th, a quarter wanted the number to remain at current levels, while 17 percent wanted an increase and 16 percent were undecided.

	Sweden has taken more refugees per capita than any other country in Europe as the continent struggles with its worst migration crisis since World War Two, and is expecting up to 190,000 asylum seekers this year.

	""When we polled opinion in September, the developments and the debate were completely different. Today the prime minister (Stefan Löfven) is asking to redistribute (in the European Union) the refugees who have come here,"" said Toivo Sjören, head of polling at Sifo.

	An Ipsos poll published on Saturday in Sweden's Dagens Nyheter newspaper similarly indicated a shift in attitudes, suggesting 26 percent think the Scandinavian country should welcome more migrants, down from 44 percent in September.

	Men and right-wing voters tended to take more negative views of migrants, with 96 percent of the far-right Sweden Democrats' supporters saying fewer should be granted residency.

	Rising opposition to the newcomers can also be seen on social media.

	According to a study conducted by Svenska Dagbladet, 35 percent of the most shared posts on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram containing the Swedish word for ""refugees"" expressed a negative opinion about the issue in October, compared to 21 percent in September.

	The Sifo poll was released as the nationalist Sweden Democrat party released further information about its latest campaign designed to discourage would-be asylum seekers from travelling to the Nordic nation.

	Joakim Wallerstein, head of communicatons for the anti-immigration group confirmed to the TT news agency on Monday that it was handing out flyers to refugees who had made their way to six countries including Greece, Turkey and Hungary. The leaflets have the headline ""no money, no jobs, no housing"". They claim that gang-related violence and rape have increased as a result of mass immigration and falsely state that it is forbidden to wear the burqa in Sweden.

	 

	""We want to attack the illusion that there is a life of luxury in Sweden,"" said Wallerstein.

	 

	The party is also planning a television commercial campaign in Syria and Afghanistan, which it says is costing ""millions"" of Swedish kronor.

	 

	Responding to the far-right group's tactics, Sweden's Migration Minister Morgan Johansson told reporters in Brussels on Monday that the Sweden Democrats were ""talking shit about Sweden"".

	 

	He said that the nationalists had painted a picture of the Nordic nation that was ""not true"" and argued that ""Sweden's global reputation is very strong"".

A group of five asylum seekers have for the first time successfully crossed the Öresund bridge on foot. But a police spokesperson has told The Local that the total figure may well be higher. 

	It was revealed on Friday that five migrants, who the News Öresund news agency reported were aged under 18, made it into the road tunnel section of the bridge from Copenhagen Airport's train station on May 12th. From there, they continued onwards on foot into Sweden.

	Police were notified after heat sensors in the tunnel alerted authorities, who stopped all train traffic. 

	""They were all young men and were handed over to the Migration Agency. We have had previous attempts on the Danish side, but they have all been caught by Danish police. This was the first time someone made the whole journey,"" police spokesperson Ewa-Gun Westford told The Local.

	The attempts follow Sweden's decision in January to demand photo identification from all travellers from Denmark as part of efforts to more closely monitor the flow of asylum seekers between the two countries.

News Öresund, which first broke the news about the most recent incident, reported on Friday that more than 55 attempts to make the journey on foot have been made since the start of the year. 

	But Westford did not rule out that the number could be higher, despite Swedish police being stationed at the border since last year, in a move separate to the photo identification checks at Copenhagen Airport.

	""There are gaps in the net, because the border control is peripheral, it's not one hundred percent. There are probably hidden statistics,"" said Westford.

	The Öresund crossing, made famous in Nordic Noir detective series The Bridge, allows drivers to travel at up to 90 kilometres an hour and includes a motorway tunnel as well as an open air road section. It is not open to pedestrians.

	""It is forbidden, but it is also dangerous, both for the pedestrians themselves and for other travellers. If there is an accident there on the bridge, it could have devastating consequences,"" said Westford.

	In April, when a lone walker was spotted walking on the motorway, Sanna Holmqvist, Head of Public Relations for the bridge, told The Local that police also had access to a network of some 400 cameras to help them detect pedestrians or any suspected criminal activities.

	The number of people seeking asylum in Sweden has dropped dramatically since the new ID and border controls were introduced, with an average of less than 500 a week showing up in the Nordic country, compared to almost 10,000 during the autumn.

	However they remain unpopular with many commuters in the region, especially train travellers who have seen their journey times increase by around 40 minutes as a result.

Swedes should not offer cash or welfare services to Roma beggars asking for money in the streets, the lead investigator behind a key national inquiry has said. 

	Sweden's national coordinator for vulnerable EU citizens, Martin Valfridsson, presented the findings of a major government begging inquiry on Monday alongside equality minister Åsa Regnér.

	""I don't think [giving money to beggars] is what helps individuals out of deep poverty in the long run. I really believe that the money is more useful with organizations in the countries of origin,"" he said.

	Sweden has experienced a surge in EU migrants – mostly part of the Roma community from Romania and Bulgaria – begging on streets around the country in the past year.

	""We see that the number of vulnerable EU citizens have increased sharply. It's EU citizens who don't have the right to welfare in Sweden. In 2015 there were up to 5,000 vulnerable EU nationals in Sweden with a small dip after the summer. Of those around 70 are children,"" said Valfridsson.

	He also suggested that offering places in schools to children of EU migrants could lead to more vulnerable families bringing their children to Sweden while begging in the Nordic country.

	""I don't think we should generally offer schooling to these children,"" he said.

	The debate about Roma beggars came to a head at the end of last year, after a controversial migrant shanty camp in Malmö was torn down by police.

	Valfridsson further discouraged municipalities from making campsites legally available to Roma travellers.

	""That creates new difficulties. Society helps reestablish those slum communities we have worked so frantically to get rid of. The message is that you're allowed to come here, but if you do you must live here legally. Society must have a strict approach to that you're not allowed to settle on someone else's land,"" he said.

	He also suggested that the government task Stockholm's county council with coordinating with other local authorities across Sweden to help spread information and assist officials in the work with vulnerable members of the EU migrant community.

	The government is next set to consider the findings of the inquiry, which did not propose a change in legislation.

	""Since we took office we have worked hard nationally and at EU level to limit and stop begging,"" Regnér told reporters at the press conference.

A flight deporting refugees from Sweden to Afghanistan departed on Tuesday evening despite protests from human rights organizations and members of the public. 

	The chartered plane left Gothenburg’s Landvetter airport with ten Afghans, some of whom arrived in Sweden as unaccompanied minors, whose requests for asylum in Sweden were rejected, either because migration authorities ruled they were older than first stated or because they turned 18 while waiting for an answer on their asylum application.

	But seven of those who had been scheduled for deportation were allowed to stay in Sweden pending further hearings. It is not unusual for planned deportations to be cancelled at the last minute, and this often happens because new information has come to light regarding the people in question. 

	For example, they may have been accepted at an institute of higher education, or have told authorities of an additional factor which they may not have previously felt able to share. The Swedish Migration Board said that one of the people concerned had been granted a new trial at the work, while another case was overturned at the request of an international court.

	In total, three of the nine who who were deported had been ordered to leave the country due to crimes they had committed, according to Dagens Nyheter. The other six had had their asylum applications rejected. And one other person, whose asylum application had been rejected, was flown to Kabul but had to return to Sweden because Afghanistan refused to accept him. 

	More than 100 people had gathered outside the detention centre earlier in the day where the young people were being held by early afternoon on Tuesday to protest the deportations.

	""Despite extensive protests from individuals as well as large organizations such as the Swedish Church, the Red Cross, Save the Children and Amnesty International, the Swedish government continues its forced deportations of young people to Afghanistan – one of the world's most dangerous countries,"" Vian Delsoz, one of the organizers of the event, told The Local.

	Many of those protesting have personal relationships with the young Afghans. One of them, Nellie Lenting, described the teenager she took into her home, Mohammad, as her ""Afghan son"", but said that once he turned 18, he was no longer allowed to live with her family.

	""We met him in February and although at the start it's a bit difficult to get a new family member, he soon started to open up and we see him as our son,"" Lenting told The Local.

	""We've filed for adoption but that process takes a very long time. He had a job here but now he can't work -- the detention centre is a bit like a jail.""

	Lenting said that both of Mohammad's biological parents were killed when he was young, he had worked in harsh conditions since the age of eight in his home country, and suffers from PTSD.

	""But that's only one tragic story, and there are many – no one deserves to be deported to a country like Afghanistan,"" she said. ""I'm not only here because of my very personal connection but because Afghanistan is one of the most dangerous countries in the world, with casualties every day. Some we hear about and some we don't.""

	Five refugees were able to stay behind at the detention centre on Tuesday, after authorities ruled their asylum application was to be looked at again before a deportation can go ahead. But around ten were on the bus taking them to Landvetter Airport, where the plane for Kabul took off at around 10.30pm.

	Last Thursday, Amnesty International published a new report saying that the deportation of minors to Afghanistan went against international law and should be stopped immediately, due to the security situation in the country.

	The Swedish Migration Agency's official stance on Afghanistan is that safety varies between the country's different provinces and that ""it is still possible to return to several areas"".

	In May, Fredrik Beijer, head of the Migration Agency's legal department, said the agency was monitoring the situation in Afghanistan, but did not confirm any imminent policy changes.

	In a statement sent to The Local at the time, Beijer said: ""The situation in Afghanistan is serious and has deteriorated in the past year. The security situation however varies between and within different provinces. We note that there is an internal armed conflict in Kabul among other places, with repeated serious attacks. Many asylum seekers from Afghanistan may therefore stay in Sweden, but the situation is not such that everyone is entitled to protection. Each case is assessed on an individual basis.""

	In August, hundreds of young Afghans held a sit-down protest against the deportations in Stockholm, which lasted for several weeks. They were joined by hundreds of members of the public, and Swedish teachers have also protested the planned deportations.

	Following the protests, Sweden's parliament debated how to respond, with the Social Democrats dismissing the demands, but the Green Party – the other party which makes up Sweden's coalition government – arguing that the refugees should be given a chance.

	One issue is that unaccompanied minors can only be deported if family members or other guardians can give them a home, however due to long processing times, several Afghans who arrived as minors have since turned 18, and are therefore treated as adults.

Sweden will soon benefit from a ""relocation"" programme for some of its asylum seekers, the European Commissioner of Migration Dimitris Avramopoulos has said. 

	""Sweden is among the group of member states that has welcomed the highest number of refugees this year,"" Avramopoulos said at a press conference in Stockholm on Monday, adding that Sweden had made ""tremendous efforts"".

	In September, the EU unveiled a plan for redistributing nearly 160,000 migrants and refugees from frontline states Italy and Greece although so far only a small number have been relocated. These include 19 people from Eritrea who were sent to northern Sweden.

	But earlier this month Sweden asked Brussels to relocate to other EU countries some of the asylum seekers arriving by the thousands in the country, after revealing that it could no longer guarantee accommodation to all of those fleeing violence in their home nations.

	""Sweden has asked to become a beneficiary of the relocation mechanism,"" Avramopoulos said. ""We completely understand this.""

	The Commissioner added that in the future Sweden would be exempt from taking in migrants under the relocation programme.

	Sweden is home to 9.8 million people and has received 80,000 asylum applications in the past two months alone, which would be the equivalent of 25 million asylum seekers for the entire EU, Prime Minister Stefan Löfven said last week, after announcing that Sweden would drastically tighten its asylum rules.

	The country reinstated border controls last month and since then the number of new migrant arrivals has dropped by a third, according to Sweden's migration agency.

The Swedish Migration Board (Migrationsverket) wants to improve how it communicates the labour migration possibilities to Sweden for would-be migrants, hoping in part to make sure future employees in Sweden know their options and rights.  

Migration Board Project Manager Anna Sjöberg said the agency was well aware that the grapevine often provided information on the ground, but that the potential for misinformation was problematic.
""Migrants talk to other migrants, it is the absolutely most frequent way of communication, which means that we as a state agency must question how correct the information is once it reaches the recipient,"" Sjöberg told The Local. 
The agency launched an official report New Route (Ny väg) into the matter on Thursday.
Its findings are based in part on interviews with some 45 Iraqis. The project team flew to Erbil in northern Iraq to speak with agencies and civil society there for input. Many of the people interviewed were unaware of the 2008 revision to labour migration, while in some cases interviewees thought it was a bilateral agreement rather than national legislation.
""Many didn't understand that it opened the door to anyone with a job,"" Sjöberg said, adding that many believed there were prerequisites about specific competences, or exclusive lists of professions facing labour shortages in Sweden to which migrants cold apply.
""It is difficult to communicate that this has nothing to do with quotas, specific professions, or industries in need of certain type of employees."" 
A person who has applied for but is not granted asylum in Sweden also has the right to apply for a work visa, as long as there is a job on offer and the papers are filed within two weeks. 
RELATED STORY:Safaa Abdulwahab, 42, went from unsuccessful asylum application to being granted the right to work in Sweden 
One year after the 2008 reform by the centre-right coalition government, 1,224 asylum seekers changed tracks to seek work visas. That number has decreased since then, reaching 684 asylum-to-work-visa swaps in 2012. 
Sjöberg said her team was aware that information given by the Migration Board staff, including some case workers, was not always consistent.
 
""The need for us to improve has gotten empirical legs to stand on with our new report,"" she said about the risk of receiving contradictory information.
The board is now pushing ahead with the help of the Swedish Institute, the equivalent to the British Council or Alliance Francaise, and of the Swedish Work Environment Authority (Arbetsmiljöverket) to make sure information about the right to apply for a work visa will be readily available at Swedish embassies and consulates word-wide. 
The tie-up with the latter is partly based on making sure no would-be migrants fall short in knowledge about procedures, and about their rights as employees.
""It is very positive if we can explain how it works, and how much it should cost to apply for a work visa,"" Sjöberg added. 
""Our project is not meant to steer people's course, rather to give people the ability to make decisions and steer it themselves.""

	“Shots were fired at a couple asleep in a car in the car park overnight. At least one shot went in through the left back door, without hittting any of the people in the car,” said police control room officer Tomas Schäufele.

	He confirmed to The Local that the two people were EU migrants from an eastern European country, sleeping rough in Boden.

	Police were called to the scene at 9am. The car park was sealed off while forensic teams investigated.

	""We are currently questioning the victims,"" said Schäufele on Thursday morning and added that police did not yet have any suspects.

	No one was injured in the incident.

	Schäufele was not able to confirm the nationality of the two victims, but thousands of so-called EU migrants are estimated to have travelled to Sweden in recent years, with one recent study suggesting the number has doubled to 4000 people over the past 12 months. 

	Most of them are members of the Roma community - one of the EU's largest minority groups - and arrive as EU tourists under the right to Freedom of Movement. Many live in tents or caravans and make a living by asking passersby for money outside shops and underground stations.

	Thursday's shooting is the latest in a spate of attacks on EU migrants in Sweden. Just two months ago two people were assaulted in central Stockholm by a passerby throwing acid at them. And two weeks earlier a beggar was targeted with a firecracker.

Sweden and Denmark have agreed to lift temporary border checks as soon as possible but must first slow migrant flows, the EU said on Wednesday after emergency talks on Europe's passport-free Schengen zone. 

	EU Migration Commissioner Dimitris Avramopoulos called the meeting after Denmark this week slapped spot checks on its border with Germany, and Sweden imposed its own controls on travellers from Denmark.

	""We agreed to keep (the measures) to a minimum and return to normal as soon as possible. This means the flows have to be slowed down,"" Avramopoulos said following the talks in Brussels with officials from Sweden, Denmark and Germany.

	""We all agreed that Schengen and free movement must be safeguarded,"" Avramopoulos added.

	More than a million refugees and migrants arrived in Europe in 2015 -- many of them fleeing the war in Syria -- in the worst crisis of its kind to face the continent since World War Two.

	The EU's cherished passport-free Schengen area has come under huge strain, as many countries have reintroduced border controls to deal with the flow of migrants trying to reach wealthy Germany, Sweden and other countries from the main landing point in Greece.

	Schengen rules mean checks can be reintroduced for up to six months.

	But Swedish migration minister Morgan Johansson said on Wednesday that the new controls ""should not be put in place longer than we need"".

	He said the checks were necessary because his country has taken in more asylum seekers per capita than any other EU nation -- 160,000 asylum requests last year, including 26,000 unaccompanied minors, with 115,000 of them in the last four months.

	Danish immigration minister Inger Støjberg said they were ""monitoring the situation by the hour"" but added that ""in Denmark we don't wish to be the final destination for thousands and thousands of asylum seekers.""

	Støjberg told reporters after the meeting, however, that she informed Avramopoulos that Denmark could implement further measures at its border “if necessary” and with short warning. 

	German interior ministry official Ole Schroeder said part of the problem was that an EU scheme to relocate 160,000 refugees from frontline Greece and Italy to other member states was not working.
