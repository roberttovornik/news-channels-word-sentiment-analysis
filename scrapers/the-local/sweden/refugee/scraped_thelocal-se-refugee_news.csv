					13:34 CET+01:00				", The Local,Why do refugees prefer Sweden to Denmark?,"Border controls were recently reinstated between Denmark and Sweden. But The Local looks into why so many new arrivals would still rather seek asylum east of the famous Öresund bridge.
1. It's a numbers game
Put simply, Sweden takes in more asylum seekers per capita than any other EU nation, while Denmark has a track record for adopting some of the toughest immigration policies in Europe.
Almost 163,000 refugees sought asylum in Sweden in 2015, according to the country's migration agency, compared to Denmark's 18,000.
Around 9.5 million people live in Sweden while there are 5.6 million in Denmark.
2. Sweden has offered permanent residency to all Syrian arrivals
Refugees fleeing the violence in Syria make up the largest proportion of people seeking asylum across Europe and in 2013 Sweden became the first country in Europe to rule that all refugees from the war-torn nation would be granted permanent residency in the light of the worsening conflict.
However the Swedish government announced plans to tighten the rules again again in November 2015.
Denmark introduced temporary one-year permits for Syrian refugees last year with the stated intention of sending them back home ""as soon as conditions improve"" in the war-ravaged country.

3. Many refugees already have family in Sweden
Given the huge numbers of Syrians who have already been given protection in Sweden (16,785 in 2014 alone), it is unsurprising that many refugees would prefer to set up home close to friends and family.
Sweden has previously offered residency permits to immediate family members of those already granted asylum (husband, wife, partner and children - under the age of 18), but announced stricter time limits in November.
Last year, Denmark said it would only allow for family reunifications if a refugee's initial one-year residency permit was renewed, a move heavily criticized by the United Nations Refugee Agency and others.
4. Sweden offers strong social benefits for refugees
Asylum seekers are offered immediate emergency accommodation on arrival in Sweden before being relocated to temporary housing. Single adults are given a daily benefit of 71 Swedish kronor per day (2,159 kronor or $256 per month), with more available for those with families.
Those granted asylum are then given help finding accommodation, are entitled to free Swedish for Immigrants lessons and may also be offered an 'introduction benefit' from Arbetsförmedlingen, Sweden's Employment Agency, giving them an income of 6,468 Swedish kronor per month ($769) while they search for work.
Denmark also offers social benefits and free language lessons for immigrants. But while it is generally more expensive to live in Denmark than in Sweden, the Danish government has recently slashed the amount of so-called 'integration' money it gives to new arrivals by 45 percent to 5,945 Danish kroner ($891) for a a single adult with no children. This too was subject to criticism from the United Nations and humanitarian organizations.

5. Global reputation
Sweden has an international image of openness and tolerance. The current government is a Social Democrat-Green coalition which has spoken out strongly in favour of helping refugees. However it announced in October 2015 that pressure on resources meant that it could no longer guarantee accommodation for everyone. Meanwhile, the anti-immigration Sweden Democrat party is growing in popularity, but is not part of the government or the country's main centre-right opposition Alliance bloc.
By contrast, Denmark's new single-party government is led by the right-of-centre Venstre, which needs the support of the anti-immigration Danish People's Party to push its agendas through parliament.
The Danish government recently launched an information campaign in foreign newspapers to deter refugees from setting foot on Danish soil. Even the country's former centre-left government headed by Helle Thorning-Schmidt touted a hard-line approach to refugees and immigrants, a record that came back to haunt her on Wednesday when she was passed over for for the position of UN High Commissioner for Refugees."

					12:21 CEST+02:00				", The Local,Swedish Social Democrats want to halve refugee numbers ,"Sweden's ruling Social Democrats have announced a bid for new asylum restrictions aimed at halving the number of refugees coming to the country, if they win the election in September.
The new migration policy promises to stop those who have had their applications rejected from receiving any social support in Sweden, and even goes so far as to ban their children from attending schools.
Immigration minister Helene Fritzon said at a press conference that Sweden should be taking in around 14,000 to 15,000 asylum seekers, much fewer than the 27,000 who came to the country in 2017, although she said she did not want to give an exact target.
""Even if the number of asylum seekers has dropped significantly in Sweden, it is significantly higher than [what it should be given] our population share in Europe,"" Fritzon said, according to Expressen. ""Not quite double, but close to it.""
The proposed policy, called ""A Safe Migration Policy for a New Time,"" includes tough new measures to reduce the number of asylum seekers in the country.
It vows to make the current temporary restrictive asylum rules voted through in 2016 permanent until the EU agrees on new rules.
It promises to further strengthen ID controls, increase the number of places in secure asylum facilities, and limit the ability of those given asylum to choose where they live.
It is particularly harsh on those who have had applications rejected, doubling the time they need to wait before making a new application, and banning them from ever returning if they do not leave Sweden voluntarily.
Local municipalities will also be stopped from giving rejected asylum seekers social support. Asked by the TT agency if this included stopping children from attending school Prime Minister Stefan Löfven said:
""No, exactly. First and foremost you are to return. Then exactly what happens in each situation, if it takes a long time to return, that's a different thing. But the principle has to be that yes is yes and no is no. If you have no right to be in Sweden, then you cannot benefit from Swedish welfare,"" TT quoted him as saying.
However, Fritzon later said on Facebook that not allowing children to attend school was not part of the proposal.
Earlier in the day, Löfven said in a press conference that the 2015 refugee crisis, when a record 163,000 people applied for asylum, had shown that Swedish migration policy needed to be reformed.
""It became particularly clear after the autumn of 2015 that Sweden's migration policy was not sustainable,"" he said.
""That only a few EU countries took their part in the responsibility during the refugee crisis was a major blow, and shows clearly the importance of a common system with a functioning regulatory framework.""
The unexpectedly harsh election pledges drew a strong reaction from the Green Party, the Social Democrats' coalition partners in the government.
""It's no secret that it is we who have been standing up for humanism at the negotiating table,"" Maria Ferm, the party's migration spokeswoman told Expressen.
Johan Forssell, immigration spokesman for the opposition Moderate Party, asked how the Social Democrats could claim to have a restrictive policy when they have just announced an amnesty giving temporary residency rights to 9,000 former unaccompanied minors who have had their applications rejected.

The Social Democrats, and other parties, have sharpened their rhetoric on immigration in recent months, in an attempt to claw back votes from the anti-immigration Sweden Democrats ahead of the September election. Last month Löfven vowed to tighten rules for labour immigrants coming to Sweden to work."

					16:06 CET+01:00				",Louise Nordström ,Suicide rate higher among refugee youths in Sweden,"A new report shows that the number of reported suicides among unaccompanied minors in Sweden is nine times as high as that among their Swedish peers. ""It's atrocious, and very worrying,"" officials say.
Last year, 12 suicides were reported among unaccompanied refugee children and youths in Sweden, compared with fewer than 10 reported cases in 2016, and zero in 2015.
""It's nine times as high if you compare it to children and youths of the same age group who grew up in Sweden,"" Petra Rinman, head of the department for Knowledge-Based Policy of Social Services, Unaccompanied Minors Centre, at the National Board of Health and Welfare, told The Local. ""It's atrocious and very, very worrying.""
The report said that among unaccompanied minors and youths in Sweden between 10 and 21 years of age, the suicide rate in 2017 was 51.2 per 100,000, compared with just 5.2 per 100,000 among their Swedish peers.
""We already knew that the number was high, which is why we commissioned this report, but it's really horrifying,"" Rinman said.
The report, commissioned by the National Board of Health and Welfare and conducted by researchers at the Karolinska Institute, found that all reported cases in 2017 were among males between 10 and 21 years of age, with a majority of them originating from Afghanistan who were waiting for their asylum requests to be processed.

Support provided to refugee children in Sweden inadequate: report
Rinman said that multiple factors play into these youths' mental welfare. ""A lot of them have lived through traumatic experiences before even leaving their homeland – they've been child labourers, suffered abuse or have little or no schooling – and then also during their journey to Sweden, and finally when they actually get here.""
She said that for some of them, the long asylum process once they arrive in Sweden means that they turn 18 – and therefore fall under the asylum procedure for adults – while they are still waiting, meaning they no longer have the same rights and security as they did when they were considered children.
""It's an enormous stress,"" she said, adding that while still under 18 and considered a child, they are under the responsibility of a municipality which is obliged to place them in school and a safe place to stay.
""Once they turn 18 they come under the responsibility of the Migration Agency, and have to move (to asylum accommodation run by the agency). It's a big risk factor because it means they are uprooted from the school they go to, the home they're staying in and other social factors that provide them with security.""
Rinman said that to prevent suicides, this particular group needs a safe and secure environment – in particular having a stable home and schooling – as well as having psychological and social support more readily available.
Ellenor Mittendorfer-Rutz, one of the authors of the report, told The Local that although the suicide rate is already very high, the real rate for the period between 2015 and 2017 is most likely even higher due to difficulty of accurately tracking these children and youths because of their lack of Swedish social security numbers (personnummer). ""And what we're talking about here are just cases that have been reported, with most of the information supplied by charity organizations,"" she said.
At the end of 2015, a total of 40,574 asylum-seeking unaccompanied children and youths between 10 and 24 years of age were registered with the Migration Agency, at the end of 2016, some 35,411 and at the end of 2017, the number came to 23,425."

Participants in the Saturday demonstration formed a human chain in front of the youths in the Medborgarplatsen square in Stockholm, holding up white sheets of paper with red hearts on.
The lone refugee youths have now been protesting for nearly two weeks, demanding Sweden stop deportations to Afghanistan.
In an open letter to the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationsverket) Director-General Mikael Ribbenvik they ask: ""Is Sweden really a moral country when you say to Swedes not to travel to Afghanistan when it is dangerous, but you think it's safe for us young people to live there? It's not human.""

Having originally staged their protest outside the Riksdag (parliament) building, the Afghan youths were forced to move to Medborgarplatsen after they were attacked by right-wing extremists on August 8th.
""It feels as though you can choose between being passive or showing where you stand. And when it comes to children it's an easy choice,"" 41-year-old protester Frida Beckman told TT newswire.

					17:26 CET+01:00				",TT/The Local,How Sweden handled the refugee crisis: report,"Swedish authorities were unprepared for the large number of refugees who came to the country in the autumn of 2015, a report on how the situation was handled has determined.
""Government agencies were not prepared, but that's not particularly strange, because they could not know how many were going to come,"" report author Gudrun Antemar told a press conference on Thursday.
Antemar, the head of Stockholm District Court, investigated how the migration situation was handled in the autumn of 2015, the year when Sweden took in an unprecedented 163,000 asylum seekers.
""The Migration Agency prioritized the acquisition of accommodation, and it succeeded in living up to its ambition of organizing a roof over the heads of everyone who came, apart from on one single night,"" reads the report, describing the situation as ""intense"".
It states that Sweden could have been more prepared if authorities had properly analyzed indications that more people than previously thought were likely to come, and taken these predictions more seriously.
""If the early information that was available had been considered and used – despite the fact that it was by no means complete or analyzed – it could have meant better preparedness for the course of events that was to unfold,"" reads the report.
But thanks to the hard work of staff and volunteers, Sweden managed to cope well with the situation on the whole, according to the report.
One of the flaws however was a delay in registering those who arrived, in particular children who came without parents. An effect of this was that an unknown number of refugee children were in the country and were placed in homes that had not been properly investigated.
""It's about the safety of the children,"" Antemar told the press conference.

The report states that because of the knowledge gathered at the time, Sweden would today be better prepared to handle a similar situation in the future: ""The experiences that have now been gained of refugee reception mean that better knowledge is available and conditions are better for a good reception system when the numbers of refugees choosing to come to Sweden increases.""
Sweden has since tightened its borders and asylum rules. A review last year by the country's state auditor, Riksrevisionen, criticized the border controls. Thursday's report however finds that the government had good reasons to introduce the temporary controls, without saying whether they should be kept in place."

Over 30,000 people registered their support on Facebook for the ‘Refugees Welcome’ demonstration, which took place at Medborgarplatsen, a square in Södermalm.
Media estimates suggested that around half of that figure attended the event, but organisers said they still considered it a triumph given the poor weather.
It's perhaps no surprise that Stockholmers were so keen to show their support - an opinion poll published on Sunday in the Aftonbladet newspaper showed that a majority of Swedes are supportive of refugees.
When 1,200 people were asked on Friday if they were prepared to help out refugees, two in three said yes, with 54 percent responding ""yes, absolutely"". Respondents defined help mostly as donating clothes or money. Less than 15 percent said they didn't want to help at all.
""It's very important to show what the public opinion is,"" one demonstrator at the rally, Arizo, 32, told The Local.
""We are a progressive people, we are tolerant and we don't want to just stand by and watch people dying in the Mediterranean, to protect our borders,"" she added.

In an interview with The Local just ahead of the demonstration Dahlin said:
""This issue has become much more visible over the past seven or eight days. People realise that this is something happening on our own shores and I really think the wind has changed. This is the top issue that people are discussing at work and around the kitchen table.""

""I will talk a lot about the fact that Europe has to live up to its standards. It’s supposed to be based on human rights and solidarity. Yet in a place where there are 500 million people the countries can’t agree on how 66,000 people should be given safety.""
The rally was also supported by youth wings of political groups from across the spectrum, with young Feminist Initiative and Left Party supporters joining members of all of Sweden’s major centre-right Alliance parties.
Hanna Cederin, head of the Left's youth movement told The Local that she was at the march to push for action from Sweden's government.
""It can't just stay symbolic...we can't just say the words, we need to act as well,"" she said.
The Stockholm rally was organised before images of a dead Syrian child washed up on a Turkish beach sparked debate around the world on Thursday, but gained momentum in the wake of international discussions about the photos.

Sweden currently takes in more asylum seekers per capita than any other EU nation. But while many Swedes have rushed to show their support for refugees in recent days, the nationalist Sweden Democrat party, which backs slashing immigration, is growing in popularity. Polls suggested last month that it is now supported by at least 18 percent of voters, in contrast to the 12.9 percent it polled a year ago in the last general election."

					15:21 CET+01:00				", The Local,Swedish government announces decision on refugee minors,"The Swedish government has reached a compromise which will mean many unaccompanied minors get the chance to stay in Sweden.
Minors who arrived in Sweden before November 24th 2015 – when Sweden's temporary tighter asylum rules came into effect – who waited more than 15 months to get their application processed and turned 18 in the meantime will have the right to have their case reassessed in order to finish school in Sweden, the government said on Monday.
Representatives from the Social Democrats and Green Party made the announcement on Monday afternoon, though they said that parliament would have to approve the proposal before it came into effect. The law is expected to come into effect by summer 2018 if parliament gives it the green light.
""We know that there are many people in many parties who see this problem, so we expect that there will be a desire to solve this in many parties,"" said Gustav Fridolin, Green Party spokesperson.
His colleague Isabella Lövin said that the proposal would apply to ""most people"" who applied for asylum before November 24th 2015, but Migration Minister Heléne Fritzon said it was difficult to give a precise figure as to how many would be affected.
Alexandra Segenstedt, a senior adviser on migration policy at the Swedish Red Cross, told the TT newswire: ""This will hopefully bring more security and the possibility to stay in Sweden, but we can see that there are many people who won't be affected.""
""We had hoped that they would look at the consequences this law has had in a more serious way before taking this decision,"" she added, referring to the temporary asylum law introduced in 2015.
The issue of unaccompanied minors who applied for asylum in Sweden has divided the government. One of the major issues is that slow processing times by the Migration Agency meant that many of those who arrived in Sweden as minors turned 18 during the months spent waiting for an asylum decision.
This means that they were processed as adults rather than minors, who can only be deported if family members or other guardians can give them a home.
The Green Party has said that these people should have the chance of a reassessment, due to the long waiting times, however the Social Democrats have been reluctant to agree to this.
In 2015, around 31,000 unaccompanied minors applied for asylum before the tighter rules were introduced in November, of which 28,400 have received a decision. Of those, a slim majority (13,400) have been allowed to stay in Sweden, while 11,500 have been rejected and the remaining 2,700 have had their cases cancelled, for example if the application was withdrawn.
Of the 11,500 whose applications were rejected, 2,150 were aged under 18 when they received the decision.
In October this year, the Council of Europe's Commissioner for Human Rights called on Sweden to improve its asylum laws and “move beyond emergency mode”, particularly in cases involving unaccompanied minors.
One of the main groups affected are minors from Afghanistan, after Sweden's Migration Agency declared many parts of the country safe enough for people to return to. Several deportation flights have already taken off, returning minors to Afghanistan, despite protests from several groups including Amnesty International, which said the deportations went against international law and should be stopped immediately.
Hundreds of young Afghans staged a weeks-long sit-down protest in central Stockholm earlier this year. They were joined by hundreds of members of the public, and Swedish teachers also protested the planned deportations. The Local spent 24 hours with the protesters.

1. Donate money
You don't need to leave your sofa to help fund emergency humanitarian assistance and support to refugees arriving at Europe's borders. If you have a Swedish mobile it takes seconds to send a text offering a donation that will be added to your next bill.
An emergency package put together by the UN's refugee agency (UNHCR) containing a towel, a blanket, water, food, clothes and shoes costs 225 kronor. Text HAV150 to 72980 to donate 150 kronor or go to www.fnflykting.se where you can donate any amount.
The Red Cross (Röda Korset) provides humanitarian relief including medical care and psychological support for refugees. Text ACUTE 100 to 72900 to donate 100 kronor or log on to www.redcross.se
Meanwhile Save the Children (known as Rädda Barnen in Sweden) is focusing its efforts on helping child refugees to secure new, safe homes in Europe. Text Katastrof100 to 72911 to donate 100 kronor or head to www.raddabarnen.se

2. Pass on unwanted clothes - or buy them
A Swedish group called Vi gor vad vi kan (We do what we can) is coordinating efforts to collect clothes, shoes, blankets and sleeping bags to send to refugees arriving in the Mediterranean.
Alternatively, you can take clothes and toys directly to asylum processing centres in Sweden where refugees have already arrived. Find out where your nearest one is on the Swedish Migration Agency's website (Migrationsverket). Some local branches of the Swedish Church (Svenska Kyrkan) also accept donations, as do Swedish mosques. The charity Islamic Relief welcomes donations at Stockholm's mosque in Medborgarplatsen at fixed times on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, depending on storage space.
Going shopping yourself can also make a difference as proceeds from some second hand stores - such as those run by the Red Cross (Röda Korset) - go directly towards helping vulnerable refugees.

3. Offer a spare room
Yes we know Sweden's big cities have a housing crisis, but if you are in a position to offer a spare room to refugees - especially unaccompanied children - some local authorities have launched schemes designed to help facilitate this. Solna, north of Stockholm, for example says it is in desperate need of volunteer foster parents while Götene in west Sweden has put out an appeal for families who are ""open and curious"" about other cultures to help provide support to vulnerable young asylum seekers, by offering them a room in a family home.
Contact your municipality to find out more about the situation in your area.

4. Sign up for a volunteering project
Numerous Swedish charities offer would-be volunteers the chance to meet and help refugees in person. The Red Cross (Röda Korset) for example sends teams into almost 150 asylum accommodation centres across Sweden where they help with language training and organizing sport and social activities.
It's worth noting that while Sweden offers free language classes for immigrants (SFI courses) these are only available for those who have been granted residency and given a personal number. With many refugees facing increasingly long waits to have their paperwork processed, locally-organized initiatives to help new arrivals pick up Swedish are in high demand.
Studiefrämjandet, which organises recreational courses for Swedish residents, is also starting study-circle teams to help refugees engage in ""meaningful activities"" before they can legally start work or formal studies.
Kompis Sverige is a Swedish charity designed to help connect long-term residents with what it calls ""new Swedes"". Each pair is asked to meet up regularly to talk and share their different perspectives on life in Sweden. The buddy scheme is currently running in Stockholm and Lund. Volunteers currently need to be fluent in Swedish in order to participate.
Love cooking? Invitationsdepartementet is a not-for-profit initiative that puts Swedes in touch with immigrants who want to practise their Swedish over dinner.
Or why not organize your own food, sport or arts-based event designed to encourage cross-cultural links in your neighbourhood.

5. Book a flight to Greece
While some holiday makers - notably Brits - spent the summer complaining about the sight of refugees in Calais or in the Mediterranean, plenty of Swedes and Danes checked in an extra bag of unwanted clothes and took it to the Greek islands or Turkey, to help migrants arriving by boat there.
Nordic tour operators including Ving and Spies even offered the option for free to customers flying out of Stockholm and Copenhagen during the high season.
Other travellers took matters into their own hands and arranged their own trips.
With temperatures still topping 20C in Greece in November and December, heading to the Mediterranean is still an idea worth thinking about as Sweden's dark winter gets under way. We recommend checking with charities first, to find out how you can best get involved with existing projects.

The decision has been appealed to the Migration Court.
Sweden has been called on to suspend deportations to Afghanistan over the deteriorating security situation in the country. However, it has so far said that it will not, and is monitoring the situation.
“Migrationsverket constantly follows the security situation in Afghanistan, and our assessment is that the situation in the country is serious and has deteriorated in the last year. But there are still big differences between different parts of the country, and our assessment is that the conflict has not reached a level where it impacts all of the country – in other words, the level required for everyone who comes from there to have the right to stay,” the Migration Agency has said in a written statement.

					15:51 CEST+02:00				", The Local,Most Swedes think refugees make country stronger: poll,"Well over half of Swedes think that refugees make their country stronger, according to the results of a new survey of ten European nations conducted by the Pew Research Center.
Asked whether refugees make their country stronger because of their work and talents, 62 percent of Swedish respondents agreed with the statement, the highest of any nation surveyed.
Germany produced the second highest number of respondents in agreement with that statement, with 59 percent, while both Greece and Hungary had the lowest at nine percent.
Sweden also produced the highest number of respondents (36 percent) who said that having an increasing number of people of different races, groups and nationalities makes their country a better place to live, though more Swedes (38 percent) said it doesn't make much difference either way.
Sweden was one of the EU states that took in the highest number of refugees per capita during the height of the refugee crisis in 2015, receiving a record 163,000 asylum requests that year.
Issues around immigration are a major talking point in the Scandinavian country at the moment, and answers in other parts of the Pew Research Center survey show just how varied and divided Swedish opinions on refugees can be.
When asked whether refugees were more to blame for crime in the country than other groups, for example, 49 percent of Swedes said they were not, compared to 46 percent that said they were.
The 46 percent of Swedes that said refugees were more to blame for crime in the country meant Sweden produced the second highest proportion of respondents of that opinion however, trailing only Italy (47 percent).
Attitudes towards jobs and welfare in relation to refugees were far clearer. Only 32 percent of Swedes said they think refugees are a burden on their country because they take jobs and social benefits – well below the median of 50 percent – and the second lowest behind Germany (31 percent).
And when it came to national identity and traditions, Sweden was also largely unfazed. Sweden produced the highest number of respondents (45 percent) who said that being born in the country was ""not at all important"" to be truly Swedish. There were also more Swedish respondents (34 percent) who said it was ""not very important"" than from any other nations.
Sweden had the lowest number of respondents meanwhile (26 percent) who thought that sharing Swedish customs and traditions is “very important” in order to be truly Swedish.
Perhaps unsurprisingly in famously secular Sweden, adhering to the country's dominant religion also appears to be of little importance for many. The majority (57 percent) said that being Christian is “not at all important” in order to be truly Swedish, the joint highest proportion of respondents from any of the nations surveyed to provide that answer.
The Pew Center's survey was conducted between April 4th and May 12th 2016, and took in the opinions of 11,494 respondents."

The three suspects ""are or were in the past members of the Nordic Resistance Movement"", a neo-Nazi group, said Mats Ljungqvist of the anti-terror prosecutor's office.
An enquiry is underway into the blast outside the centre in the southwestern city of Gothenburg on January 5. It left an immigration office staff member seriously injured with wounds to his legs.
One of the suspects in the bombing was taken into custody earlier this month. The two other arrests were made on Wednesday and Thursday.
The Swedish intelligence service Säpo said in a statement that the attack, which has been linked to two others in Gothenburg in recent months, appears to have a political motive.
The first incident took place on November 11th, when a bomb went off outside the Syndikaliskt Forum Kafe, a well-known far-left haunt. No one was injured in that blast.
Then an explosive device was found on January 25th at a campground which was temporarily housing migrants. It failed to detonate.
All three explosive devices were ""placed in public areas"" and there are other elements which suggest that they are linked, said Ljungqvist."

					14:55 CEST+02:00				",Lee Roden,IN DEPTH: The shifting sands of Sweden's immigration debate,"The Local's Sweden In Focus series looks at the shift in Sweden's immigration debate since the dawn of the refugee crisis.
In 2014, Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt's speech calling on Swedes to ""open their hearts"" to asylum seekers could have been read as just another chapter in Swedish openness to immigrants. Four years on, it is far more difficult to imagine a leader of the country's biggest parties using the same rhetoric in their efforts to win the 2018 election.
Moderate PM Reinfeldt's summer 2014 speech came in a year when an increasing number of refugees were looking to Sweden and its generous asylum policies for shelter. Twelve months later the full scale of just how many there were heading north was evident, culminating with a record 163,000 people applying for asylum in the Nordic nation in 2015.

Fast forward to the present, and the numbers have dropped immensely, last year hitting an eight-year low of 25,666 following a significant tightening of policy. The tone has also changed notably, with election talk from the Moderates focusing on solving the Swedish ""problem"" rather than opening hearts, and speaking of foreigners living on subsidies and failing to speak Swedish. Main rivals (and current senior government party) the Social Democrats meanwhile promise to make studying Swedish an obligation in order to claim benefits should they be elected, and to halve refugee numbers with further policy restrictions.

Has the Swedish approach to immigration really changed to the degree that juxtaposition suggests? Andreas Johansson Heinö, political scientist and head of publishing at free market think tank Timbro, certainly thinks so.
""There has been a dramatic shift in the discussion in the last four years. 2014 is remembered for Reinfeldt's 'open your hearts' speech but what primarily marked that election was that the established parties wanted to avoid discussing the immigration and integration question. 2018 is the first election where immigration-related questions take centre stage in the debate,"" he tells The Local.

The latter point isn't difficult to prove. The front pages of the official websites of the Social Democrats and Moderates (traditionally Sweden's two major governing parties) both prominently refer to integration. The Sweden Democrats (SD), which have been running on an anti-immigration platform for some time, meanwhile are predicted to be the biggest rival to those two in the next election, according to the polls.
Some would argue that recent talk from the Social Democrats of a ""language obligation"" for immigrants, and Moderate leader Ulf Kristersson's decision to use his Christmas speech to emphasize that ""in Sweden we speak Swedish"" are a shift towards populism taken straight from the SD playbook in an effort to win back votes lost to the latter party.
READ ALSO: Study Swedish or lose welfare, Social Democrats propose
Johansson Heinö thinks there is a risk of the two traditional political powerhouses further turning to populist rhetoric in an electoral panic, after what he sees as several years of not sensibly discussing immigration from both parties.
""The change (in asylum policy approach) in 2015 didn't have so much to do with SD. What we saw was an almost panicked adaptation to a reality that changed very quickly. But in the run-up to this year's election both the Social Democrats and Moderates have moved closer to SD's rhetoric. Voters haven't bought it so far, with the opposite happening and SD having an upturn in opinion polls.""
""It's inevitable that a country that has had such extensive migration sooner or later has to respond to the consequences of it. It's also clear that many have been forced to rethink the self-image of Sweden as a tolerant and open country to immigrants. There were some blockages in the debate which could be due to dogmatism, like when during the previous mandate period it was very difficult to discuss the scale of immigration,"" he adds.
It's common in Sweden to hear the idea that it was previously not socially acceptable to discuss immigration with a sceptical stance. But Pieter Bevelander, professor of International Migration and Ethnic Relations at Malmö University, who has researched policy towards immigrants in Sweden, argues that an immigrant-sceptical approach is not new to the country, and that rather the tone has gone in waves.
""It seems like the Moderates and Social Democrats are reverting to their politics from the past, pushing for a more hard-line approach to integration, and restrictive migration. This has happened several times before in history: in the 1970s, 1980s, 1990s and now again. So there's nothing new – some of the rhetoric of today was also used in 1990,"" he explains to The Local.
Pieter Bevelander. Photo: Malmö University
A 1990 opinion piece by prominent Swedish diplomat Sverker Åström illustrates Bevelander's point well. Published in popular newspaper Dagens Nyheter, it called for a cap to be put on immigration, insisting that Sweden ""evidently can't take in everyone or even a fraction of those who want to settle down here"" after fleeing the Yugoslav wars.
Cultural requirements should be placed on immigrants, he argued, and assessments made on whether ""he or she came from a country or a culture whose customs and practice are so alien that a somewhat harmonious adaptation is difficult or impossible"".
Those words could fit perfectly into the contemporary immigration debate in Sweden almost 30 years later. Similar too is some of the context: over 100,000 Yugoslav refugees came to Sweden in the early 1990s, and not everyone welcomed them with open arms. Much of the scepticism towards them has since faded, with people from the former Yugoslavia now championed as an example of successful integration in Sweden.
IN DEPTH: What can Sweden learn from its Yugoslav refugees?
""Opinions on Finns, Yugoslavs and others from earlier were negative in the beginning and changed over time,"" Bevelander notes.

Thorough research on how opinions on immigrants in Sweden has evolved is not plentiful, but a new report on the changes in attitude towards immigration between 2014 and 2016 was published only last month by Sweden's Migration Studies Delegation.
The results suggest that opinions on immigration in Sweden did not shift as significantly or quickly as the change in rhetoric and policy between 2014 and 2016, and that rather, people had already formed their opinions before then.
""You could have thought there would be a bigger change when it comes to opinions on these questions given how high they were on the agenda, how much immigration changed in that time, and how the political rhetoric was,"" Nora Theorin, one of the authors of the report, tells The Local.
Instead of a dramatic change from one side of the argument to the other, the report shows that people who were generally positive towards immigration grew slightly more positive, while those who were negative grew slightly more negative – a process of entrenchment that will sound familiar to anyone following debates on Brexit or Donald Trump, for example.
""It's important not to exaggerate how much more polarized Swedes became about immigration during the time period of the study as the changes were quite small. But what we saw was that certain groups – women, politically interested people, people who sympathize with the Left party or Feminist Initiative – became somewhat more positive, while at the same time the opposite happened for certain groups that were more negative from the start. But it's only from one study and quite a limited period, so more research is needed to see whether we are becoming more polarized,"" says Theorin.

A third key point from the study is that Swedes seem to be more positive towards those coming from culturally closer regions like Europe or the Nordics than they are to those from Africa or the Middle East. A majority said that ""too often immigrants have traditions that don't fit Swedish society"", and in general cultural similarities appeared to be more important in shaping attitudes towards immigrants than their economic contributions.
""There seems to be more evidence that cultural differences explain why people feel worried about immigration rather than economic issues, but at the same time we can also see that most people in the study think immigration enriches Sweden culturally. So it's not as simple as to say that people generally think that immigration from different cultures doesn't work at all – though there does seem to be some doubts in the area,"" says Theorin, adding that further research is needed.
The phenomenon is in any case one that is supported by other studies beyond Sweden:
""There is research which suggests people are generally more positive towards immigration from parts of the world they believe to be culturally or ethnically closer to their country. That there's a difference in attitude towards 'culturally remote' or 'culturally close' immigrant groups.""

That may partially explain why people from the former Yugoslavia, who were initially met with some scepticism over concerns their culture would not be adaptable to Sweden (as expressed by diplomat Åström), were eventually embraced to the degree that they can now successfully run for office to represent Sweden – about as significant a barometer of public acceptance as there is. Many of the original fears were dispelled in the long-term.
It remains to be seen whether today's immigrants will achieve the same, and leave history absolving Reinfeldt's optimistic approach. Or if the opposite will occur, and the more cautious approach of 2018 is vindicated. Either way, the debate on immigration in Sweden will certainly shift again in the future – the past has proven has much."

					07:49 CEST+02:00				", The Local,"Fewer than 500 of 163,000 asylum seekers found jobs","Of almost 163,000 people who applied for asylum in Sweden last year, less than 500 landed a job, according to a report by a Swedish public broadcaster.
Using figures from Sweden's employment agency Arbetsförmedlingen and migration authorities Migrationsverket, SVT reported on Tuesday that 494 asylum seekers who arrived in 2015 have managed to find a job to support themselves while waiting for their application to get processed.
A person who arrives in Sweden with valid identification documents and has applied for asylum is normally allowed to work despite not yet having a work or residence permit, if Migrationsverket grants them an exception.
Such an exception is called the 'at-und' and usually gets processed automatically, reported SVT. However, only a third of asylum seekers aged 20-64 were given one in a year when Sweden received an unprecedented number of asylum claims.
“It was an incredible number of people applying for asylum in Sweden and so that we would be able to register all of them, we had to de-prioritize certain tasks, and that was the matter of jobs,” Migrationsverket officer Lisa Bergstrand told SVT.
The centre-left Social Democrat-Green government wants to hand out mainly temporary residence permits in the next three years, which would step up the pressure on asylum seekers to find work. A permanent permit could be offered after the first expires, if the person is able to support themselves.
But figures suggest that the gap between Swedes and foreign-born is likely to grow. In April, the unemployment rate among people born in Sweden was at its lowest since before the global financial crisis in 2008, falling to 4.7 percent. The equivalent among residents born abroad was 14.9 percent.
Long waiting times for residence permits, today up to a year, makes the matter all the more pressing. But Arbetsförmedlingen has little means of supporting asylum seekers looking for work.
“They may be registered in our database as unemployed, but they are only entitled to basic services, that is using our online services and talking to advisers. But there are no programme-based alternatives, that is no courses and no traineeships,” Fredrik Möller, integration officer at Arbetsförmedlingen, told SVT.
Meanwhile, other initiatives are slowly emerging in Sweden. Earlier this month The Local wrote about Sana Abdullah, 30, an IT engineer who got a job after only seven months in Sweden through Sync Accelerator, a recruitment agency helping startups connect with asylum seekers.
“There are a lot of people coming from Syria who are very talented and have a lot of experience especially in the field of IT. It's good to use these qualifications and it will benefit Sweden too. I know a lot of people who want to work, not just learn the language,” she told The Local at the time."

					06:59 CEST+02:00				",Lee Roden,What lessons can Sweden learn from its Yugoslavian refugees?,"Two decades ago thousands of refugees fled war in Yugoslavia and made Sweden their home, where today they are a well-integrated part of society. The Local explores what Sweden can learn from that experience, as part of our Sweden in Focus series.
During the Yugoslav wars in the 1990s, many of those fleeing the conflict looked to Sweden for protection, with just over 100,000 coming to the Scandinavian nation at the time. In 1992 alone, 70,000 people from the former Yugoslavia applied for asylum in the country – a record high number for a calendar year until it was surpassed in 2015.
More than two decades later, the refugees who came to Sweden from the former Yugoslavia are held up as an example of successful integration in the country, and with good evidence. A 2016 study showed that a significantly higher proportion of Bosnians (who made up the bulk of the refugees from the Yugoslav wars) are employed in Sweden compared to other foreign-born residents. In the 20-24 age bracket, employment was at virtually the same level as native Swedes, and the proportion of those employed aged between 25 and 29 was even slightly higher than people born in Sweden.

The success of refugees from the former Yugoslavia in Sweden is not only evident in statistics, but also in the number of important figures in the country with origins there. Jasenko Selimović, an MEP for the Liberals and former state secretary to centre-right integration minister Erik Ullenhag, was born in Yugoslavia and fled from the war as a teenager. Aida Hadzialic, who fled as a refugee at the age of five, became Sweden's youngest ever cabinet minister when she took up the position of adult education minister in 2014. Social Democrat Jasenko Omanović, who also came as a refugee, is a sitting MP in the Riksdag. Away from politics, there are also several Yugoslav refugees in important positions at leading Swedish companies like Nordea, Ericsson and Volvo.
But what lessons can Sweden learn from its successful integration of Yugoslavian refugees? Perhaps the biggest takeaway from the experience is that a good match between the people coming in and the systems of their new home is worth its weight in gold. One thing all the experts The Local spoke to for this article highlighted was the harmony between the general makeup of those who came from former Yugoslavia to the Scandinavian country, and developments in Sweden, which was moving towards a knowledge-based economy at the same time.
Similarities in level of education was particularly vital to the long-term success: Yugoslavia's education system, where primary schooling was compulsory until the age of 15 and students were encouraged to follow upper secondary education until the age of 19, was not dissimilar to Sweden's, where school is compulsory until 16, and most pupils then go on to upper secondary school.
""Sweden had the system it had and received a highly educated and strong group from the former Yugoslavia,"" Emina Pasic, President of the APU Network Association for academics, entrepreneurs and artists of Bosnian-Herzegovinian background in Sweden, explained to The Local at the Swedish Energy Agency's office in Stockholm, where she is now a senior advisor.
""We ranked well compared to similar countries and had a lot of foreign students in Bosnia and Herzegovina who came there to study, which is very important. And I'm not just talking about higher education: but also basic education, high school. We had a very strong education system which put very high demands on kids from a young age and they were graded early on. Not everyone had the same experience – of course some probably found it very tough here ­– but considering the high demands back in Bosnia, it felt quite natural when later in life here, at Swedish high school (gymnasiet) there were demands. We came to the country accustomed to a high level, and that meant we could develop.""
SWEDEN IN FOCUS: An in-depth look at what makes this place tick

Sweden was apparently well aware of that suitability at the time. A Swedish government document from 1993 optimistically points out that ""the integration of these people should be made easier in that it is the question of a relatively homogenous and well-educated group"".
A comparable standard of education not only made it easier for those from former Yugoslavia to adapt to Sweden's own education system, but also for them to go on and become employed.
""When we studied what had worked at the Department of Integration when I was state secretary, we looked at different groups and how they adapted to Swedish conditions,"" former state secretary Jasenko Selimović recalled.
""What it showed quite clearly was that ethnicity means nothing – the first wave of Iraqis to come here, the diaspora that Saddam Hussein threw out of the country who were very highly educated adapted perfectly well for example, the second wave who came after the education system had been destroyed had big problems.""
The first major wave of Iraqi refugees in Sweden came during the 1980s and 1990s as a result of the Iran-Iraq War, the first Gulf War, and the actions of Hussein's post-war government which forced many to flee. The second wave was caused by the 2003 US-led invasion of Iraq.
""It's not about ethnicity, or religion or anything else, it's two main questions: educational level, and the possibility of recognizing the system of the country as being similar to your country of origin. These two things were similar for refugees from the former Yugoslavia, and that's why they succeeded,"" he continued.
Government measures were also taken to try to ease the transition, like when in 1993 the Swedish government stepped up its mapping of the educational background and employment experience of the refugees in an effort to get them on the correct road to employment.
""These measures during the introductory period mean that the chances of Bosnian refugees integrating well in Swedish society after moving to a municipality will increase,"" it argued.
Economic support for municipalities increased too, as the government warned that ""even those who learn Swedish and have a good chance of doing well could have a difficult time supporting themselves"", due to the financial crisis gripping Sweden in the early 1990s.
""There was quite a lot of emphasis on employment policy measures for refugees from Yugoslavia to help them into the labour market,"" noted Jan Ekberg, professor emeritus in economics at Linnaeus University and an expert of the economics of migration.
Sweden didn't get everything right however. Far from it. A policy of distributing the refugees across Sweden in an effort to avoid creating concentrated groups, and by extension encouraging quicker integration, did not take into account the fact that some municipalities were suffering more than others from the high unemployment that followed the financial crisis. It backfired.
""That's one thing Sweden could have done better: they could have made sure not as many Bosnians were placed in the Malmö area. Unemployment there was very high in the mid 90s,"" he said.

A lack of local knowledge and language ability means immigrants take time to settle and enter the labour market in their new home, and with unemployment high in the aftermath of Sweden's financial crisis, refugees were at a heightened disadvantage. Of the Bosnians who were given a residence permit between 1993 and 1994, only 24 percent in the 20-59 age bracket had found employment after four years.
As the new millennium arrived things improved significantly, but with notable regional differences. So while by 1999, 90 percent of male and 80 percent of female Bosnian refugees aged 20-59 living in in Gnosjö, Gislaved, Vaggeryd and Värnamo were employed, the corresponding figure for Malmö was 37 percent and 28 percent respectively.
By 2013 the regional differences had decreased dramatically (71 percent of both men and women in Malmö were employed), and it is reasonable to conclude that the integration process for those who ended up in the southern Swedish city would have been quicker if they had been placed in regions with a better economic outlook from day one.
""Swedish authorities should from the start have avoided placing Bosnians in the Malmö area where unemployment was higher, though in the end it still went well for them,"" Ekberg concluded.
The issue of lost time is one that APU Network President Pasic also recognizes. Though like many refugees from Bosnia and Herzegovina who came to Sweden with secondary education, she still had to undertake basic compulsory courses which she believes were a waste of resources.
""Our first encounter with Sweden was a language course for all refugees, but you sat there and learned how to do things like use a toilet, brush your teeth… simple things that a highly educated person didn't need, but were obligatory,"" she recalled.
""You thought 'where have I ended up? What kind of country is this?' You accepted it: OK, it's obligatory, so that's it. But on the other hand I think, how much did Sweden lose with that? The time spent on that for a highly educated person regardless of whether they needed it or not could have been much better used. As soon as someone becomes active in the labour market, earns money, and pays tax, then Sweden is a winner, and you start changing the attitude of society that refugees are a burden. Which is what extremist parties make gains from – the idea that people are coming here to take advantage of what Sweden has to offer,"" she insisted.

At this point it is worth recalling that as far back as 1993, the Swedish government was supposed to have stepped up its assessment of the education and employment experience of refugees in order to get them on the right road to employment, which should have helped avoid time-wasting like Pasic's tooth-brushing example.
In 2014 however, a National Audit Office study pointed out that time was still not always being effectively used when recognizing the qualifications and skills of refugees, and the overall conclusion was that there were inefficiencies in the state's measures. Sweden has subsquently taken steps to become more flexible in the kind of introductory programmes it provides in order to try and speed up the integration process, with one example being the Public Employment Agency's ""fast track"" (snabbspår) programme of work experience and training designed to help Swedish employers better weigh up a new arrival's qualifications from an early stage.
Sweden's experience with refugees from former Yugoslavia not only shows that the ability to weigh up a newcomer's qualifications is important in the process of integration however, it has also been suggested that familiarity can play a part. Unlike many of the groups to come to Scandinavia in recent years, Yugoslavian immigrants were not a new phenomenon in Sweden when refugees started arriving during the war: by 1990 there were already 50,000 from the country living in Sweden, with many coming to the country as much-needed labour migrants in the aftermath of the Second World War.
MEP Selimović has concluded that being able to call upon an established network in Sweden for example, which some of those from former Yugoslavia could do when they arrived, was important to their employment prospects and therefore the potential to integrate.
""Something that helped me a lot is that in Sweden you get the job in informal ways, everything is informally checked. So you phone someone to check out how the candidate is, and they give you quite honest information about the applicant. That's how Sweden works. The problem with other refugees or foreigners coming to Sweden is they don't have anyone who can provide that information,"" he said.
""In my case, I had it. My mother was here before me, she worked at the Yugoslavian embassy before the war. That network was enough. In my opinion, one of the important improvements we could make is to accept the idea that we work in a global world, competing with other people coming from other countries, and that things can't be underneath the surface because immigrants will be disadvantaged. You have to believe in formal methods,"" he added.

Academics have also concluded that long-standing roots meant Yugoslavian refugees probably faced less suspicion when competing for employment than other refugees from groups not previously established in the Swedish labour market.
Sweden's experience with refugees from former Yugoslavia was a positive one, but there are still important lessons to be learned. A correlation between the Sweden of the 1990s and the nature of the people coming in eased the process, as the country's labour market was a good match for the competencies of the largely well-educated refugees at that time, and that suggests that the successful integration of the present generation of asylum seekers from Syria and elsewhere will also depend on how capable Sweden is of matching them to jobs – something the Swedish government has previously pointed out to The Local.
The Yugoslavian experience also shows however that even if there is a good match between Swedish society and the skills of those attempting to enter it, the process can still be hindered by counter-productive policies, like placing refugees in areas suffering from high unemployment. Notably, the potential to waste valuable time by not effectively assessing the skills of newcomers was an issue Sweden was aware of as far back as 1993, yet by 2014 had still not comprehensively solved. Today, there are some signs that the Nordic nation is starting to do better when it comes to more quickly recognizing the abilities of the people it has brought in, but work still needs to be done.
The issue of discrimination meanwhile is not unique to Sweden, but still one that requires tackling. Refugees from former Yugoslavia may have had their cause eased by their compatriots already being a well-established presence in Sweden by the early 1990s: other refugees cannot yet call on that capital. Sweden's Employment Minister has openly recognized that discrimination is a key problem for foreign workers trying to get jobs here today, and APU Network President Pasic warned that a general attitude change is still needed in her adopted home.
""We need to actively work on and have a migration policy that sees migration as a positive process for Sweden, with good communication. Otherwise it can go in the wrong direction and help extremists grow – which we're seeing not just in Sweden, but the rest of Europe. That's migration policy failing: it's something we have to fight against,"" she emphasized.

Last year, 420 minors who arrived in Sweden without their parents left their asylum homes without reporting their departure to authorities, according to Stockholm's county administration board.
The authority was appointed by the government to examine why, and how many, young refugees disappear after they are registered in the system as seeking asylum in Sweden.
And officials raised concerns on Thursday about the rising number of disappearances in 2016, which is already well on its way to breaking last year's record. A total of 313 are currently missing, according to the Svenska Dagbladet (SvD) newspaper.
“How will you find food? How will you get money? For an adult to give you money they might demand a quid pro quo, such as sexual services or committing crimes,” Kjell-Terje Torvik, who works with children for the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationsverket), told SvD.
While some choose to return to their home countries, he said it was often difficult to say why the minors leave their temporary accommodation in Sweden, adding that it varies depending on their stage in the asylum application process.
“If the disappearance comes after a decision, it is often triggered by an asylum rejection, but if it happens before a decision it is not as certain what triggered it,” said Torvik, who claims that many of the unaccompanied refugee children end up on the street, often falling victim to prostitution or crime.
“The number is concerning, but it is also not clear because you don't know the reason for their disappearance. But of course there is a risk that prostitution would rise when the children have no money, no structures and nowhere to live,” police officer Christian Frödén told the newspaper.
Sweden took in a record 163,000 asylum seekers fleeing wars in Africa and the Middle East in 2015, including more than 35,000 unaccompanied minors, two thirds of whom came from Afghanistan.
Migration authorities have previously said they expect a surge in the number of asylum seekers going underground in the next three years, estimating the number at as many as 46,000, including adults.
In October last year officials in Trelleborg in southern Sweden told The Local that they believed almost 1,000 unaccompanied refugee children and young adults had gone missing before even having their paperwork processed by the Migration Agency."

					09:05 CEST+02:00				",TT/AFP/The Local,Sweden doubles refugee arrival forecast for 2015,"UPDATED: Up to 190,000 asylum seekers are expected to arrive in Sweden in 2015, more than twice as many as previously predicted, the country's Migration Agency announced on Thursday morning.
The agency estimates that a total of between 140,000 and 190,000 refugees will have come to the Nordic country by the end of the year. Of those, 29,000 to 40,000 are expected to be children travelling alone.
Another wave of between 100,000 and 170,000 people are predicted for 2016.
The numbers are more than twice as high as the agency's forecast from earlier this summer. In July it predicted 74,000 asylum claims would be made over the whole of 2015. And Director-General Anders Danielsson told reporters at a press conference in Stockholm that Thursday's figures may change.
""We note that the current refugee situation is unprecedented in modern times. We see pictures of people literally walking from Greece, across the Balkans and Germany and towards the Nordic countries. More people than ever are seeking asylum in Europe, but there is no border control and no exact figure,"" he said.

In a press release, the agency warned that more accommodation must urgently be made available if Sweden is to be able to cope with the increasing influx of people fleeing wars in Africa and the Middle East. The country is likely to be short of 25,000-45,000 places at asylum centres by the turn of the year, it said.
""The sharp increase in asylum seekers coming to Sweden means the Migration Agency's current capacity is no longer sufficient to provide an orderly reception of new asylum seekers,"" said the release.
Danielsson said at Thursday's press conference that the authority was investigating a range of options, including housing refugees in former bomb shelters. The move follows similar discussions in Switzerland, which suggested earlier this month that asylum seekers could be put up in nuclear bunkers if needed.

Asylum immigration is expected to cost Sweden 60.2 billion kronor ($7.23 billion) in the coming year and 73 billion kronor in 2017. The Migration Agency said on Thursday that it is likely going to need 29 billion kronor on top of what has already been included in its budget for this year and 41 billion next year to manage the situation.
Finance Minister Magdalena Andersson admitted that the sharp increase in asylum seekers would put a strain on public finances, saying that the government would be looking at ways to lend and save money to be able to cope with the crisis. She added that there was no immediate plan to raise taxes.

Sweden, a country of 9.8 million, is known for its generous asylum policy and welfare state, and is a preferred destination for refugees. It has one of the highest proportion of refugees per capita in the European Union.
""The EU's and individual member states' actions will play a decisive role in how many asylum seekers come to Sweden in the future,"" Migration Agency analyst Merjem Maslo said in a statement.
Commenting on the new forecast on Thursday morning, Justice and Migration Minister Morgan Johansson told reporters that it was more important than ever that other EU countries step up to take in more refugees.
""So far we have managed to give these people roofs over their heads (...) but it is easy to look at this and draw the conclusion that it is not sustainable for Sweden if it continues,"" he said and added that he would continue to push the issue at a summit of European ministers next month.

Meanwhile, the Dagens Nyheter newspaper reported that a crisis meeting between the ruling Social Democrat-Green coalition, the Left Party and the four mainstream centre-right opposition parties originally scheduled for Thursday had been cancelled at the last minute.
The parties are instead set to meet on Friday, sources told the Swedish daily.
Sweden's Prime Minister Stefan Löfven this week raised concerns that ""Sweden is approaching the limit of its capacity"". But the Social Democrat leader also told Swedish media on Wednesday that he felt ""warm and proud"" to be running a country that was doing so much to help asylum seekers."

					14:29 CEST+02:00				",Lee Roden,24 hours on Stockholm's streets with refugee protesters,"What drives someone to spend over a month sleeping outdoors in protest? The Local spent 24 hours with refugee youngsters on Stockholm's streets to find out why they are so strongly against deportations to Afghanistan.
The sit-down protest started at Mynttorget in front of the Riksdag building on August 7th. In the month since, the season has changed as well as the location. Twice, in fact, with the protesters first moving to Medborgarplatsen in Södermalm, then to their current location at Norra Bantorget in the city centre.
The Local first met them during the opening week of the demonstration in the summer, the morning after a night in which they were attacked by a far-right group. Defiant, the youngsters insisted that violence and intimidation would not deter them from their goal of convincing Sweden to halt deportations to Afghanistan, which the youths say is still plagued by violence and insecurity.

A month later, the weather has taken a turn for the worse, but many of the youngsters are still protesting, sleeping in the cold on the hard stone of Norra Bantorget, in a continued effort to achieve their goal. The Local decided a fresh visit was due, but this time it would be a longer one – 24 hours – in order to better understand what it is like to spend all day and night out in the open in the Swedish capital, fighting what seems like an uphill battle at best.

When I arrived at the square at lunchtime on September 5th, the ground had just about started to dry up from a previous day of continuous rain that many of the campers admitted was the toughest of the whole month on the streets. I had expected some scepticism from a weary group as a result, but instead was greeted with smiles, and instantly invited to sit down in a circle and join in an animated dicussion.
Tea was quickly poured from a thermos and handed to me with a ""help yourself"" – something that would become a theme over the next day. After a failed attempt to teach me some Dari, as well as how to drink tea ""the Afghan way"" (by dipping cubes of sugar in the tea then holding the sugar in your mouth while you sip it), the conversation started to really get going when it turned to the universal language of football.
Soon, 12 of us were all taking part in a passionate debate about the most important question in the universe: Cristiano Ronaldo or Lionel Messi? Arguments in Dari were translated to Swedish and vice-versa, and there was certainly something amusing about a bunch of Afghans and one Scot, sitting in Sweden, debating the merits of a millionaire from Portugal and a millionaire from Argentina.

This may seem trivial, but our ability to find common ground despite a lack of any shared history meant I already couldn't help but wonder if more face-to-face meetings like this between different groups would be worthwhile for everyone.
The group soon introduced me to Fatemeh Khavari, a young woman who at only 17 has taken on the role of their spokesperson. Impressively clear in her ideas and embarrassingly skilled with the Swedish language despite only two years in the country, she informed me that she had arranged for a speaker to come and try to raise the spirits of the protesters, which had flagged following the heavy rain.
Erkki Grönroos arrived and was quickly given pride of place, with everyone gathering around as he began to tell his story, listening with an unwavering interest. Now 76, he came to Sweden in 1941 when he was only five months old, one of around 70,000 war children (""krigsbarn"") who fled Finland during hostilities between them and the Soviet Union in the Second World War.
""You aren't the first young refugees in Sweden. It's the same feeling you have now as we had then. It was traumatic for a lot of us to be separated from their parents, just what you're experiencing now,"" he began.
""In the beginning I was so poorly nourished I couldn't hold down any food, I threw up everything. Luckily my Swedish mum was a nurse – mamma Berta, as I call her, was a wonderful person. She took care of me in the best possible way and I couldn't have had it any better. A lot of other kids weren't so lucky, and were used as labour, virtually slaves,"" he continued.

For two hours the group was captivated by Grönroos. Khavari, who clearly has a natural talent for languages, translated with a seemingly effortless ease from Swedish to Dari, then translated questions from some of the kids back to Swedish again. ""What would you say to the Swedish government if you could speak to them now?"" one of them asked.
The Finnish refugee's voice rose and he broke into an impromptu speech in response:
""Change the rules. Stop focusing on paragraphs, think with your heart. When I came here we were taken with open arms, given help and protection. Sweden was poor then. Today Sweden is rich. We can take these kids in, all of these kids sitting here today will be needed in the future in this country. It means nothing if an official goes to Kabul, surrounded by security guards, in the safest part of the city, then comes back and says 'it's safe'. Of course nothing will happen then, but how many of these kids being sent back get that? None. They're being sent to their deaths.""
Grönroos was referring to Migrationsverket's official stance on the situation in Afghanistan. The agency recently insisted that safety varies between the country's different provinces and that ""it is still possible to return to several areas"". That's despite Sweden's foreign ministry advising its own citizens against all travel to the country, which Migrationsverket argues is because they use different criteria and because the level of threat varies depending on whether you are a westerner or a member of the local population.
""Sweden has a long tradition of taking in refugees. In the Second World War, the Hungarians who Sweden gave protection to in the 1950s, Chileans after the military coup, the war in Yugoslavia. Sweden always showed solidarity and took people in,"" elaborated Grönroos, explaining why he supports the protesters in their cause.

The interest the group took in the 76-year-old's talk supported the impression they gave throughout my stay: that they are keen to learn about the culture of Sweden and in no way fit the image of entitlement that some paint refugees with. That was similarly reaffirmed when several of the kids asked a Swede from an NGO to explain the history of the monument that dominates Norra Bantorget. It depicts Hjalmar Branting, Sweden's first ever Social Democrat Prime Minister, addressing a group of workers on May Day, he told them. Along with Christian Lous Lange, Branting was jointly awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1921 for his work in international diplomacy. His acceptance speech focused on ""fraternity among nations"".

Grönroos left as day started to turn to night, and soon food was again offered around by the protesters. A homeless man who came to the group asking for a banana was given a full meal instead. The camp was well organized: some kids took turns dealing out meals, others cleaning up with brooms, and those who drew the shortest straws were tasked with keeping watch during the night – a necessity following the attack at Mynttorget, it was explained.
After dinner I started to make conversation with Hossein Akbari, who had travelled south from Umeå in August to take part in the protests. When I asked a simple, and in hindsight naïve, question about Afghan music, his answer served as something of a wake-up call, and a reminder of the nature of the place he and the other protesters had left behind. ""You have to understand, in Afghanistan a lot of things aren't always allowed, it's not a democracy,"" he said with an uncomfortable look on his face. The Taliban, who still control large parts of Afghanistan, are not fans of music to say the least. Suicide bombers have even targeted music performances by children.
Akbari made the 5,000 kilometre journey to Scandinavia with five of his friends. One, who went to Norway, now has a residence permit. Two, who went to Finland, have received deportation notices. And of the three who crossed the Öresund Bridge into Sweden, two have had their asylum applications rejected and one is still waiting for an answer. He is one of the two who received a rejection, and has appealed, but is not optimistic.
I asked him how the protesters have kept themselves occupied during the month or so that they have been demonstrating. ""I try to pass the time by studying multiplication. I didn't get an education in Afghanistan – I started working almost as soon as I could walk – so now I'm catching up,"" he recalled in excellent Swedish, despite only being in the country for two years and with little formal education to his name.
I had anticipated that a moment of escapism would be welcomed by the protesters, so at this point I unveiled my secret weapon: a football. The result was a game of two-touch football that drew in more and more people from the group as it progressed. The ball was treated like gold dust – a rare distraction from much heavier thoughts. The game ended up going on for almost four hours. Watch the video below.
After it turned dark things quietened down, with some of the younger kids who only come during the days heading back to their homes. Occasionally the police stationed nearby would come and speak to spokesperson Khavari to make sure everything was OK. Aside from the occasional sweeping of a brush from the youngsters tasked with cleaning, there was little more than the sound of a low murmur, finally broken when a shout in Swedish of ""can someone help with this bag? It's a bit heavy?"" came from the bottom of the stairs below the monument. A woman who had brought some food after passing by stood there. ""It's something for breakfast. I'll be back tomorrow, what do you need?"".

Moments like that helped keep the group optimistic, Akbari noted:
""You feel a genuine care when that happens. You don't feel alone, and that there are people around us who care about us. You get an energy boost when you meet other people, when people like you come here to visit and see what's happening. That helps.""
Though keen to make as much of the opportunities to get an education that Sweden presents before he is possibly forced to leave, the 18-year-old decided to put his studies on hold to join the protest. For him it's about something bigger than even school – which he does not take lightly.
""I dropped everything to come here from Umeå. This is about my life. Ultimately you can hopefully go back and study a month later, but this is about living.""
We were eventually joined by Benjamin Fayzi, who with a residence permit and five years in Sweden under his belt, is in a different situation to many of the protesters. Yet he still feels an obligation to show support.
""I have a permit, I have a job. I finished upper secondary school. I don't know these people – they're not my family, they weren't friends. So people ask why I'm taking part, but it's important for me. Look, if something as simple as football for example is important for a person, they engage with it, go to matches, support it. This issue is important for me, so I support it,"" he explained.
""For the first two weeks I continued to work then came here at night, but after that I couldn't keep it up, so I took some time off. I was drinking loads of coffee just to get through it.""
Fayzi is one of the protesters who has been taking part since day one. Like Akbari, he places great value in meeting outsiders while demonstrating.
""It's even more important when Swedish people come and meet us. People who don't have the problems these kids do, but want to defend their rights. If they do that, how could I not? That gives you hope for the future. You think: OK, maybe I won't go to school this week, or maybe I won't have great food for now, or I'll maybe have to sleep on the streets for a few nights a month, but hopefully for the rest of my life I'll be able to live in security, safe and with freedom. Not being terrified all the time that I'll be killed, or being constantly at risk.""

""A lot of people come past who didn't know about our situation,"" he continued. ""I've spoken with many who say 'Oh, OK, it's like that? There's war?'. They've maybe heard from the government or Migration Agency that it's safe in Afghanistan, these people don't need asylum. Now, after meeting us, they start to think 'how safe is it really?'. Have they asked all the questions? Have they really looked into it?""
He is particularly critical of the Swedish Migration Agency's statistics, which say that 83 percent of lone refugee children processed to date in 2017 have been given residence permits.
""But those figures don't include the kids who were under 18 when they came in 2015, and the long processing time meant they have now turned 18 and didn't get a permit as a result. So there's a big section not included in the stats,"" he insisted.
Another contentious issue in Sweden is asylum seekers who say they are under 18 when they are registered in the country, but lack ID to prove it. Controversial medical age assessments have even been brought in to prove or disprove claims. Fayzi is quick to point out that Afghanistan does not have the same structures as Sweden, which complicates the matter.
""Part of the problem is that we don't have the same level of ID as in Sweden, you're not registered automatically when you're born. A lot of people don't know the exact date they were born – they don't have documents, so they don't know exactly how old they are. If those kids don't know exactly, but know roughly, that's the only answer they can give you.""
He also challenges the perception that refugees come to Sweden to sponge from the country's welfare state, pointing out that he has had a full time job from as early as possible. Akbari, who has worked almost all of his life without choice, also finds that portrayal saddening.
""I don't need money – I've worked for almost as long as I could walk – I just want the chance to live.""
""That's such an important thing. People say 'you're coming here for money', but I explain it's not about money, food or homes. There are still some homes and some food in Afghanistan, that's not why we came here. We didn't have security, freedom and safety – it's for those things that we came. That's why we fled. So as long as they allow us, and as long as we need to, we'll protest, arguing that,"" Fayzi added.

With that, it was time for bed – the point in the day I had least looked forward to. Settling down for the night was about as comfortable as you would expect with 20 people lying side by side on the cold ground under a tarpaulin. The transition to autumn is under way in Stockholm, and the nights have become cooler. One night is bad enough, but some of the demonstrators have been doing it for a month, giving up comfort in pursuit of a cause. It was hard not to admire that determination.

I eventually drifted off at two in the morning, woke up at six, then managed to get an hour or so again before being woken up abruptly once more – this time by the sound (and feeling) of leaf blowers being used by council workers in the square. Not an alarm clock method I had considered previously, nor one I would care to repeat.

Afghan bread for breakfast was soon offered by a guy who, despite us not really having a language in common, I had established a friendly rapport with – he was a keen member of the pro-Messi camp, which helped. It was almost time to leave, but I still had to speak properly with Khavari, the spokesperson who so many of the group seemed to look to for advice and help.
As she ended a phone call with tears in her eyes, I asked her what had upset her. ""Racists have targeted me and my family online,"" she said, adding that she was unsure whether there was any point in reporting it to the police. Sure enough, later that day a quick Google search revealed that several websites had decided a 17-year-old girl was their new enemy, anonymously questioning whether she was ""really a man"", among other insults, and posting pictures of her family without permission.
Khavari's leadership and ability to speak convincingly and intelligently had apparently irritated some people. It had left an impression on me too – a positive one. I asked her whether it was something she had always been capable of.
""I started speaking in front of people and singing sometimes when I was 13. The first time I sang in public I was still tiny, in front of 3,000 women.""
At only 17, Fatemeh Khavari (right) has become the group's spokesperson. Photo: Lee Roden/The Local
Though of Afghan background, she lived in Iran all of her life before coming to Sweden:
""When I started to sing and speak, even from the beginning, I wasn't nervous at all. I don't know why. When I was a kid in Iran I was treated very badly because I'm an Afghan, so that had an impact on me, and taught me that I would need to stand up for my rights. In Iran that was almost impossible because it's not a genuine democracy, so you couldn't be public about it.""
In secret, she started to write down her thoughts in poems and verses, then publish them on a website.
""Most of it was about politics. When I came to Sweden in 2015 I kept writing, and I also started painting. I do a lot, everything really.""
""But all of that took a back seat to the suffering that there is here in Sweden today,"" she continued. ""Young people from my country have been living on the streets after having applications rejected, committing suicide over the stress of the asylum process. All of that affected me. So I became someone who would stand up for them, I saw how many rights they weren't being given.""

Khavari is determined to win her battle, noting that ""until we get an answer I won't leave that task. I have a clear strategy"". Her tone changed, more downbeat this time:
""If this doesn't work, then we'll have to go on a hunger strike. I don't think there's any other alternative. That's the last resort.""
The longer their protest continues without any result, the less optimistic Khavari is about the outcome, she admitted.
""When I was in Iran we suffered violence and discrimination, so we fled to Sweden, which we thought was the only place left in the world where we can be free. But when I came here I was still discriminated against,"" she said.
""Sweden is the one place where anyone fleeing violence can seek security, I thought. But now after these 30 something days sleeping on the streets, where we still don't know what will happen to us and whether we'll be listened to, I can say for sure that we are not really accepted here. I'm trying not to lose hope but I'm saddened… I don't know,"" she stopped.
""Afghanistan's government can't do anything. Sweden's government doesn't want to do anything. Iran's government will definitely do nothing. Where should we go? We have nowhere. I'm thinking about that a lot now, of the possibility that Sweden will end up disappointing me and won't turn out to be the moral country I thought it was.""
That has led her to considering an outcome that she has found difficult, but believes may be necessary.
""After this strike is over, I'll try to find somewhere new to live, despite having friends and family here. I won't choose to live in a country where there's no humanity. The silence there is right now has broken my heart.""
The dampness had returned when it was time to go. Photo: Lee Roden/The Local
With that, the stay was over. Though some now don't feel welcome in Sweden, the demonstrators had welcomed me with open arms. After 24 hours in the company of an inspiring group of young people who, despite having experienced things difficult for most of us to comprehend, are warm-hearted, engaging and in many ways enlightening, I can only recommend that more people come and speak to them, hear them out before forming their opinion. Perhaps they would learn something, as I did.

					14:39 CEST+02:00				",Lee Roden,"Swedish media paint unfairly negative image of young refugees, researcher argues","The image of lone refugee youngsters painted by Swedish media is unbalanced and unfairly negative, a researcher at a Swedish college argues.
Mehrdad Darvishpour from Mälardalen University College is in charge of leading the ongoing integration research project ""Refugee children's inclusion and gender equality development within society"", which involves discussions with refugee youngsters between the ages of 15 and 18 living in Sörmland and Västmanland.
He argues that Swedish media portrayals of the group are disproportionately negative in their focus.
""In general they only produce stories saying it's a problematic group who are a social burden, that the kids can't adapt to social norms and the culture, or even that they are harassing girls and even are a threat in that regard. It's all a negative image,"" Darvishpour told The Local.
""But through my research I've found that they're mostly very prosperous when it comes to school for example, and that'll be seen in the labour market, compared to kids who came with their parent. So actually, they should be taken as a participant, a resource. Some of them do have traumatic experiences of course – but that traumatic experience can lead to a resiliency in them, so that they end up doing better for themselves,"" he added.
READ ALSO: How is Sweden tackling its integration challenge?
One of the areas the project investigates is whether there are any differences in integration success between youngsters who came to Sweden with their families and those who came alone and live in HVB homes, Swedish residential homes for young people. The study has involved extensive interviews with both the youngsters and adults who interact with them.
""These kids who came on their own are quickly interacting with Swedish society through their HVB homes. And they don’t have family with them to limit who they form relationships with for example,"" he explained.
""Virtually all of them end up competent in the Swedish language. Most of the interviews we did were in Swedish, yet they didn’t even have a residence permit yet. It showed just how keen they are to learn the language, their desire to become a part of society is huge and they're very grateful. This group has an easier time of changing their culture, an easier time of adapting, so that’s why we shouldn’t see them as a problematic group in our discourse. Just giving a negative image of them doesn’t help.""
Darvishpour conceded that not all media are equally negative in their portrayal of the group, but argued that there is a dominant negative discourse in Sweden at the moment.
""It's not all media of course, and it’s not just media, it's political discourse. Studies show that if xenophobic parties grow, their discourse creates a climate, and that affects the other parties and opinion. So it’s not just media – nor is it all media – but it's a dominant discourse."""

					16:53 CET+01:00				",TT/The Local,Sweden cuts 2017 refugee forecast further,"More asylum seekers are expected to come to Sweden in 2017 compared to the year before, but the number has been reduced from a previous estimation, according to the Swedish Migration Agency's (Migrationsverket) latest forecast.
The authority expects 34,700 people to seek asylum this year. That's a decrease compared to its previous estimation for 2017 of 36,700 which was carried out last autumn, but would still mean more requests than those registered in the country during 2016 when 29,000 asylum applications were submitted.
""The biggest challenge for Migrationsverket is that during this year we need to make more decisions on applications than ever before across all categories. We now have an intake system which is working to reduce the volume, which means we can get control of and make more decisions for more people to get an answer in their cases,"" Migrationsverket acting deputy chief of operations Veronika Lindstrand Kant noted.
There is still potential for the forecast to change further however, with the agency saying that it could range from as little as 25,000 requests to as many as 45,000 depending on developments.
""Above all that's because of the agreement between the EU and Turkey (which means refugees are returned from Greece to Turkey unless they want to apply for asylum in the EU country). Will it continue? There's a lot of uncertainty there. On top of that, we also expect our border controls to expire in November, and that border controls will only be granted for two years,"" Lindstrand Kant added.
Sweden recently extended its temporary border controls in the south of the country until May 2017. They were introduced during the height of the 2015 refugee crisis.
Sweden's Migration Minister Morgan Johansson said he is not particularly worried however, and does not consider the agreement with Turkey or the continuation of border controls to be as great a cause of uncertainty as the Migration Agency suggests.
""The EU will not allow the kind of uncontrolled rush which we saw in the autumn of 2015 for example. That would be politically very difficult to accept for the EU member states,"" he told news agency TT.
What Johansson and the Migration Agency do agree on however is the challenge of finding housing for new arrivals. The agency estimates that it needs an additional 1.3 billion kronor ($146, 596) to be able to ""comply with the applicable laws and regulations"" by allocating the relevant allowances to asylum seekers, municipalities, and local government, as well as provide housing for them."

					10:03 CEST+02:00				", The Local,Sweden offers residency to all Syrian refugees,"Swedish migration authorities have ruled that all Syrian asylum seekers who have come to Sweden will be granted permanent residency in light of the worsening conflict in Syria.
Sweden is the first country in the EU to offer permanent residency to refugees from Syria, news agency TT reported.
The decision covers all asylum seekers from Syria who have been granted temporary residency in Sweden for humanitarian protection. They will now receive permanent residence permits, the Swedish Migration Board (Migrationsverket) announced on Tuesday.

Previously, around half of Syrian asylum seekers had been granted permanent residency, with the remaining half receiving three-year residence permits.
The assessment is based on whether a person has an individual or general need for protection. As the situation in Syria has deteriorated and is now ""extreme and marked by general violence"" with no solution in sight, the agency has judged the poor security situation in Syria to be permanent.
The decision means that the roughly 8,000 Syrians who have temporary residency in Sweden will now be able to stay in the country permanently.
They will also have the right to bring their families to Sweden.
While Malek Laesker, vice-chair of the Syrian Arabian Cultural Association of Sweden (Syrisk arabiska kulturföreningen i Sverige), welcomed the decision, he also warned it could create problems.
""The fact that Sweden is the first country to open its arms is both positive and negative,"" he told the TT news agency, explaining that it may be a boon for the growing people-smuggling market.

He also expressed concerns that the move will add more fuel to the already inflamed debate about Sweden's immigration policies.
""We already have a crisis around that issue in Sweden. I hope that our politicians solve it in a nice way,"" he said.
In 2012 and 2013, a total of 14,700 Syrian asylum seekers came to Sweden. Together with Germany, Sweden is the EU country which has accepted the highest number of asylum seekers from the war-torn country.
In its statement, the Migration Board warned that asylum seekers who may be guilty of war crimes or crimes against humanity for their actions in Syria would lose their right to be classified as refugees or in need of protection.

					16:55 CEST+02:00				",TT/The Local,How Sweden wants to keep refugee numbers down,"Sweden's migration minister on Wednesday outlined an updated version of how the government wants to tighten asylum rules to discourage refugees from travelling to Sweden.
""This has been the most difficult task I have had on my desk in my almost 20 years as a politician at this level,"" justice and migration minister Morgan Johansson told a press conference in Stockholm.
The plan builds on a proposal first mooted by the ruling centre-left Social Democrat-Green coalition in November last year, following a record influx of asylum seekers to the country.
However, it eases some of the tough restrictions initially proposed, following criticism by experts, other authorities and government agencies.
The changes to the November proposal include:
- Temporary residence permits will be extended for 13 months rather than 12 months, which means refugees are covered by Swedish social security benefits such as child care funding.
- Those who land a job may be given permanent residence permits. However, this will not apply to people under the age of 25, unless they have completed the equivalent of a high school education. This is to avoid young refugees dropping out of school to seek employment.
- In some ""special cases"" family reunification and the process of getting permanent residency for minors, for example children with health problems, will be made easier.
""It's not the case that we've closed the borders. More than a hundred asylum seekers are still coming every day. We're doing more than anybody else, we're making the biggest humanitarian effort since World War Two. I think we should be bloody proud of that,"" Johansson was quoted as saying by Swedish tabloid Aftonbladet.

The government's bid was criticized by politicians left and right of the centre on Wednesday.
""It's still a proposal which is an incredible tightening of refugee policies and makes it difficult for people who are fleeing,"" Left party leader Jonas Sjöstedt told the TT newswire.
Meanwhile, a spokesperson for anti-immigration party the Sweden Democrats argued it was too lenient.
""To make sure that Sweden doesn't become the most attractive country in northern Europe, we would need stricter rules than our neighbouring countries. We're not getting that,"" said Mattias Karlsson.
Sweden took in around 163,000 asylum seekers last year, but struggled to provide accommodation for all of them. The number has since gone down, following border and ID checks introduced around the turn of the year, with around 500-700 weekly applications at the moment.
However, according to the latest forecast by the Migration Agency, up to 140,000 may arrive in 2016, which Johansson said would mean that Sweden would run out of housing by the summer.
""If we don't do anything we risk going back to the situation we had last autumn,"" he said.
If approved by parliament, the proposal is expected to come into effect this summer."

					06:59 CEST+02:00				", The Local,Refugees welcome? How UK and Sweden compare on education for young migrants,"OPINION: The UK should learn from Sweden when it comes to educating young immigrants, argues Nottingham University's Joanna McIntyre in this opinion piece first published by The Conversation.
In the UK, the world's fifth richest economy, vulnerable children are being denied education. Asylum seekers and refugee children are struggling to access education – and unable to attend school or college. This contravenes rights to equal educational access in accordance with international human rights law.
I'm currently working on research projects about child refugees, one of which compares experiences of children in the UK with those arriving in Sweden – and I am concerned that the UK education system is not currently fit for purpose or able to provide adequate schooling for every child.
The fact of the matter is that refugee children should be resettled in the UK. It is quite simply the right thing to do for obvious humanitarian reasons. As Ghandi observed: ""The true measure of any society can be found in how it treats its most vulnerable members.""
Lessons should be learned from countries such as Sweden, where more inclusive practices are already in place. It should also be considered how education policies and practices are working against schools and teachers who want to welcome refugees but who are unable to.

Hassan's story
Take Hassan, he's 15 and Iranian, and I met him at an arts workshop for recently arrived child refugees in the UK. Hassan had been in the UK for four months and did not yet have a school place.
His age is the first barrier when it comes to an education. This is because Hassan should be in year 11 – GCSE year – which means a school could be reluctant to take him because he is unlikely to have sufficient preparation time for exams.
Teachers are also under massive amounts of pressure to deliver outcomes to boost their school's progress scores and performance in league tables. And new arrivals such as Hassan – regardless of their prior attainment and experience – are unlikely to be able to adjust to the English school culture and absorb the content and skills required to pass high stakes examinations in the remaining months of year 11.
The second barrier is language. When we met, Hassan had a friend translating. And until he has a school place, Hassan will be reliant on the support of volunteer groups for English language lessons.
There is another practical barrier, too – Hassan had a letter from his local authority (which he carries with him) saying there are three potential schools for him. But none are near Hassan's home, and two of the schools are two bus rides away.

Navigating the system
If Hassan isn't successful in finding a school place in 40 days, his case will appear before what's known as a Fair Access Panel. This will allocate a place to Hassan and there will be a further period of time when the school can appeal this decision.
Should he find a place, the school, undoubtedly worried about balancing budgets and managing limited resources, will decide which class to put him in, which subjects, and which sets. He might also attend an intervention programme to develop his English and help him access the curriculum, but such places are limited.
More likely, Hassan will be placed in a mainstream classroom and given in-house language support – which will mean withdrawal from some lessons. He will probably also be placed in lower sets because his English will mask his real ability.
These decisions will have short, and maybe, longer term implications for Hassan's prospects and for the friendship groups he develops.

The Swedish way
But until Hassan gets a school place, he is stuck. He reached the UK but is unable to begin making a new life because he cannot access the support the education system should be able to offer him. And if this is still the case after the age of 16, his experiences are likely to be worse because places in post 16 provision are often even more limited.
But had Hassan landed in Sweden, he and his family would access two hours daily of Swedish language tuition – as part of their residence permit. In school, Hassan would also receive two hours teaching per week in his home language.
This reflects research which shows that when it comes to language learning, a bilingual environment is most successful. This means a child's first language is continued to enable them to learn a second or third language more quickly.
In Sweden, Hassan's local school would also commit to enrol him as quickly as possible. Often within a fortnight of arriving in the country.
Like Sweden, schools in the UK should also be inclusive spaces that offer education for all rather than just for league tables. This is important because young refugees are likely to complete their education in their new country – becoming full members of their “post-settlement” society.
So instead of restricting access to education, the UK should instead recognise the potential of these children and welcome them in its schools as they begin their new lives.

					09:54 CET+01:00				", The Local,Sweden to give millions to Turkey refugee deal,"Prime Minister Stefan Löfven announced on Sunday that Sweden would contribute to a joint action plan agreed by nine EU nations designed to limit the number of refugees arriving in Europe via Turkey.
The deal came after the German Chancellor Angela Merkel held a surprise summit in Brussels involving the leaders of nine countries including Sweden, France and the UK.
The European nations agreed to pay Turkey three billion euros overall – with 500 million euros coming from the EU budget and the rest made up by member states – to help cover the costs of the more than two million refugees already in Turkey, with more arriving every day.
""It is obvious that the EU and Turkey need to work [together] more and better, both to improve the situation of refugees in Turkey, but also to secure the borders and combat human trafficking,"" Sweden’s Prime Minister Stefan Löfven said after the meeting.
The Swedish leader said his country was expected to put in the equivalent of around 77 million kronor (8.3 million euros, 8.8 million dollars).
""The hope of course is that fewer [people] have to leave Turkey in order to get to Europe on these perilous journeys,"" Löfven added, in reference to the dangerous boat travel across the Mediterranean that has already claimed the lives of thousands of refugees.
Germany’s Chancellor told reporters that so far Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has received little international aid in the refugee crisis.
""Turkey justifiably expects the EU to take some of the burden off its shoulders,"" Merkel said.
As well as offering cash aid, leaders said that Turkey's discussions with the EU on visa-free entry to Europe for its citizens would continue, with the move possibly coming into effect by October 2016. Talks to join the bloc will also be sped up, with a new chapter of negotiations opened as soon as next month.
In return, Turkey has promised to do a better job of guarding its coasts and hunting down people traffickers.
The deal is a big step for Europe, which has proved reluctant to move forward with accession negotiations in recent years, citing Erdogan's increasingly authoritarian governance of his country.
Turkey has come in for sharp criticism of its justice system and a lack of press freedom in particular.
""Human rights, press freedom – all these things are important and will keep coming back up,"" EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said.
”It's not three billion euros for Turkey's public treasury, but three billion that will go specifically to improve the situation of refugees,” stressed Löfven."

					06:59 CEST+02:00				",Lee Roden,'When people ask me if I'm a love refugee in Sweden I say no...it's the insulation',"It wasn't the usual allure of love or even the Scandinavian lifestyle that brought Irishman Jack Ryan to Sweden. Rather, it was the love of something much more simple: decent insulation.
""It was the really boring things like the fact that there was really good insulation and you could walk around indoors in your underwear even though it’s minus 20 outside that got me,"" he tells The Local, laughing.
“So when people ask me if I’m a love refugee I say no… it’s insulation. And the other thing is I like the fact that there are seasons here. Ireland has not so much variation between winter and summer. I enjoy the seasons we have here that are very different.”
Ryan was working for Greenpeace when he first came to Sweden as part of a six month project in 2007, and indeed has spent most of his adult life working NGOs. Though he had long wanted to go out on his own and run a business, he always found the prospect of compromising his morals to be tricky:
“The only thing I could think of is that it’d be interesting to start a business that could use some of the ethical principles of non-profit, and in a way that both the consumer, the supplier and the business owner could benefit. I had lots of ideas but when I thought them through I would see that someone, somewhere would get screwed so it wasn’t the thing for me”.

That changed when he had the idea for his startup, Muttley & Jack's Coffee Roasters, which buys high quality coffee from growers at a fair price then delivers it to the doorstep of its members. The concept was inspired by his travels back home: though Ireland is not traditionally known as a nation of coffee specialists, the downturn of the Celtic Tiger years started to changed that.
""Ireland has been a tea drinker's haven for centuries. I travel back there four to six times year and have done ever since I moved here, and I just noticed that there was something exciting happening in the whole food scene in the aftermath of the Celtic Tiger collapse. Cheaper spaces were allowing people to come in and set up businesses they couldn’t afford before. People started focusing much more on delivering a quality product because the population was more discerning in what they would do with their now much more limited capital,” he recalls.
“So I noticed there were more and more great coffee shops popping up all over the place, and serving things that tasted of more than just roasted coffee beans. You could taste different elements. So because of that I started to get into coffee.”

Sweden by contrast is a nation of coffee drinkers, but not necessarily a nation that drinks high quality coffee across the board. Ryan saw an opportunity to join the fledgling specialty coffee scene in the Scandinavian country however, using a model where customers pay for a membership and have beans delivered straight to them, rather than the more standard practice of selling the product in cafés or stores.
“We’re only two months into the venture and I think people are surprised in some way that coffee can have such a wide variety of tastes. Swedes drink a lot of coffee but most of it has been roasted to death,” he points out.
“There’s about 50 speciality coffee roasters all over Sweden and every year a couple more join them. It’s growing. I think it’s a bit like wine was maybe 20 years ago, when people had a choice between ‘red’ and ‘white’ and didn’t know much about the origin and how it would taste different from different countries. Nowadays people have favourite countries, regions, grapes, they’re much more discerning and can talk about what they like. I think coffee is on the same path, that in maybe five or 10 years more than half of people will have a favourite country for their coffee’s origin.”

The focus on high quality coffee is combined with focusing on giving a fair deal to the farmers themselves, which isn’t always the case with more popular mass-produced coffee:
“Most of the commodity coffee you get in normal chain stores is bought and sold on the stock exchange either in New York in London. Speciality coffee skips over that and buys directly from the growers, and generally pays 200 to 400 percent more than what they’d get if they sold it on the market.”
“We work very closely with the producers to give them feedback on what we think is good, and what they could do better, and that we’d be willing to pay more if they’re able to produce a consistent level of quality year after years. So they get paid two to four times as much as they would otherwise and invest in working sustainably and delivering ever increasing quality,” he adds.
The ethical focus is an easy sell in Sweden where those issues are given greater attention than in some other countries. But that can also be a double edged sword when it comes to trying to help small scale coffee producers, the entrepreneur argues.
“A lot of the growers we work with are very small growers. Even if they’re part of a cooperative, if that cooperative is going to be certified as organic, every member has to be certified as organic, and it’s quite expensive to get certified as both Fairtrade and organic. A lot of the farmers we work with simply don’t have the money to prioritise that. Even though, in 99.9 percent of cases, they’re actually practising organic farming.”
“We go and see if the farms are organic in practice if not in certification. That’s still a business we want to support and product we want to deliver, but it creates a challenge here in the marketplace to communicate why organic isn’t on every single bag. That’s a good chance to engage people though, and if they have an open mind they can understand a bit more about some of the shortcomings about the labelling and certification game,” he elaborates.

Another of the company’s goals is to try and reach people who are not already coffee experts, and perhaps feel intimidated by the sometimes elitist specialist coffee world, then try to make it accessible to them and provide knowledge in a manageable way.
“Speciality coffee is still mostly consumed by coffee nerds – and what can you teach them? But there are lots of people who have heard about speciality coffee then maybe gone into a coffee shop and felt intimidated. What we’re trying to do is take speciality coffee, make it approachable, and answer questions that maybe I was curious about a couple of years ago but didn’t have answers for.”
As such, each delivery of beans comes with an info card containing a small piece of information about coffee, with the idea being that customers build up their knowledge over the long term by reading small nuggets of information each month.

Workshops are also offered three times a year, teaching members skills like how to brew coffee at home and how to roast beans. For the die-hards meanwhile, there is even the opportunity to join Ryan on a trip to visit his coffee growers – provided they can make their way there.
“People will get themselves to the meeting place, it could be an airport in Kenya for example, and the next five days we’ll have everything organized: we’ll take them to coffee farms to see the coffee growing, meet the people who grow it and the communities that benefit from it, and I guess this is the one thing for the coffee nerds. But it’s the kind of thing that’s only open to people in the trade at the moment.”
“But again, like wine, people go on vineyard tours, so I think there’s a possibility people will want to do that as well,” he predicts.

Though it’s still early days, one thing the startup owner has noticed after a few months in business in Sweden is that people in the country’s specialist coffee scene are surprisingly helpful towards their competitors.
“It surprised me at first because I thought going from the non-profit world where people help each other a lot between different companies, to the commercial world, would be so different. But the speciality coffee market is very much like the non-profit world in my experience, people do help each other. One guy who was coaching me for a while explained that a rising tide floats all boats: so if you can lift the overall quality of coffee in the country, you don’t have to squabble over the pie, you can just make the pie larger.”
It only felt right to tap into the coffee expert’s knowledge while we had him at our disposal, so we asked Ryan a question that will likely be one plenty of people have pondered: with so many different ways to make coffee now offered these days, which method is the best?
“I think the old school method of a hand pourover brewing is best. You have total control, and if you do it in the morning it can be a moment to slowly have this meditative practice. It takes three or four minutes.”
“The main thing I would say though is invest in a grinder at home. If there’s one thing you can do to improve the taste experience it’s to grind the beans before you brew them. It’s a bit like if you buy a loaf of bread and cut it all up into slices then use it for the rest of the week, the bread’s going to taste worse and worse. It’s the same with beans,” he concludes."

					08:58 CEST+02:00				",TT/The Local,Sweden unveils new refugee age assessment model,"Sweden will make medical age assessments of unaccompanied asylum seekers by examining their teeth and knee joints. The new system, unveiled on Friday by the national forensic medicine agency (Rättsmedicinalverket), aims to tackle doubts over the accurate age of those who seek asylum in the country.
With over 35,000 coming last year alone, Sweden has taken in more unaccompanied children and young people than any other country in Europe, and many of them lack identity documents.
The migration authority (Migrationsverket) makes an initial age assessment with every application, but the tests have been criticized for being ineffective. If a person is not clearly over 18, they are registered as a child.
In the last year, several Swedish municipalities have reported suspected cases of adults being placed together with children at residential care homes for young people (known as HVB homes), as well as being sent to school with minors.
According to the migration board, there are doubts about the accurate age of 70 percent of unaccompanied minors who have stated that they are between 15 and 17 years old.
As a solution, the Swedish government asked for medical age assessments to be carried out on a large scale. Rättsmedicinalverket detailed at a media conference on Friday when that work will get under way and explained how it can be done.
Between 15,000 and 18,000 age assessments will now be needed, the agency said. The two methods that will be used are dental maturity assessments involving wisdom teeth, and the examination of knee joints using MRI. The two examinations will be performed independently by MRI clinics and dental clinics.
""Medical age assessments are an integral part of forensic medicine in many other countries, so it is only natural that we carry them out,"" Rättsmedicinalverket methodology manager Elias Palm commented.
The agency expects to reach an agreement to outsource the assessments by December this year, with the goal of starting the tests during the first quarter of 2017.
Earlier this week a Swedish pediatrician sparked debate when he criticized the current tests authorities use to verify the real age of asylum applicants, claiming some could even be as old as 40.
""The refugee children who are in their early and mid-teens are the ones who end up paying the price for this. These are resources that have been earmarked for children, but are used for another age group,"" Josef Milerad told newspaper Expressen."

					12:36 CEST+02:00				",Emma Löfgren,Swedish talent matchmaker helps refugees land IT jobs,"Two women IT engineers from Syria have scored jobs on the Swedish startup scene thanks to a new scheme matching skilled refugees with tech companies trying to attract foreign talent.
Numerous surveys and research show that immigrants are finding it difficult to enter the jobs market, often facing long waits for residence permits and struggling to get foreign qualifications recognized in Sweden.
Meanwhile, the Swedish tech industry says it is in desperate need to attract international talent.
""Sweden is a lot worse than many others to see that skills come in various shapes and forms. I think that that is one of the mechanisms that makes it so difficult for immigrants to get on to the jobs market and have a career,"" Swedish business developer Johan Engström at education consultants Sipu International, who is behind a pioneering initiative to find a common solution to these two problems, tells The Local.
He started 'Sync Accelerator' on behalf of Sipu International in October last year, at the height of Europe's refugee crisis which saw Sweden take in an unprecedented 163,000 asylum seekers.
Since then he has spent hours sifting through resumes, contacting businesses and raising the word – and reveals that the scheme has now succeeded in matching up its first candidates with a company.
Sana Abdullah and Safinaz Awad, two 30-year-old IT engineers from Syria, are just in the process of signing their contracts with BigSpin, a startup based in the bustling Södermalm area of Stockholm, a popular hub for Sweden's booming technology scene.
""We think there's big potential in the group of newcomers and Sync Accelerator makes it easier to reach them. (…) I don't think the [startup and tech] industry could have expanded as quickly without foreign workers,"" BigSpin founder Jonathan Persson told The Local on Monday.
Awad, who is based in southern Sweden, and Abdullah are now set to join the design and web developer's four-person team as soon as they manage to find somewhere to live in Stockholm.
""It's exciting. It's very important to me to find a job, to meet new people and learn the language. This company uses a lot of new technologies, so I can learn a lot, and hopefully they can learn from me,"" Abdullah, who is currently based in Uddevalla in western Sweden, tells The Local.
The 30-year-old of Palestinian origin has seven years' experience working in IT engineering for the stock exchange in Damascus. But she had to give it up when war broke out and she fled.
""It was difficult to leave, when you have a country you grew up in and all the memories, but we had no choice. I came alone, my family were already in Sweden, they've lived here three years.""
Johan Engström and Sana Abdullah. Photo: Private
Her situation is similar to that of many other asylum seekers in Sweden today, with the exception that Abdullah, with the help of Sync Accelerator, has scored a job just six months after arrival. But for many, even after the long wait (often up to a year) for a residence permit is over, there are still several hurdles along the way.
""It takes new arrivals on average six to eight years to get a job. But with the immigration we have right now we can't afford to fail – we're already seeing rising tensions. But it is also good for the business scene and Sweden's ability to compete [globally] to use the new talent,"" says Engström.
Abdullah agrees: ""There are a lot of people coming from Syria who are very talented and have a lot of experience especially in the field of IT. It's good to use these qualifications and it will benefit Sweden too. I know a lot of people who want to work, not just learn the language.""
Engström hopes to use the recruitment fee BigSpin has paid to Sync Accelerator to keep the momentum going and match up even more skilled refugees with Swedish companies. With the help of his colleague Abdel El Hennawy he is currently going through the 300 applications he has received.
""We've got 40 people at the moment who have the qualifications needed to be able to work immediately, with minimal introduction to the job. If we manage to get enough funding from that segment, we may be able to provide help for those who perhaps need a bit more training.""
He hopes that his effort will help combat recent statistics which say that 21.4 percent of Sweden's foreign-born population were out of a job in March 2016, compared to just 4.7 percent of people born in Sweden.
The ruling Social Democrat-Green coalition has invested in a number of initiatives designed to help immigrants get jobs, including state-subsidized internships and short-term contracts to help employers taking on foreign staff members. However, because both Abdullah and Awad are still waiting for their asylum applications to be processed, none of these schemes apply to them.
And Engström remains insistent that Sync Accelerator will only match their candidates up with fully paid positions with the same benefits enjoyed by Swedish workers according to trade union regulations.
""There is this view that new arrivals should be interns and work for free. But if they come here with competence then surely they should be paid for that competence?"" he argues.
""We have decided that we're going to raise the standard of the product, not lower it. We fight for the new arrivals."""

					06:50 CEST+02:00				",Paul Connolly,'Refugees must be taught the Swedish way of doing things',"Sweden should be proud of the way it has dealt with the refugee crisis but the hard work has only just begun. The Local's northern Sweden columnist, Paul Connolly, argues that Sweden must now teach newcomers how to be Swedes.
Sweden has now more or less run out of resources with which to cope with more refugees, but for much of 2015 the Nordic nation led the way in ameliorating the crisis.
But that's the way Sweden rolls. For several decades Sweden has been at the vanguard of social progressivism.
I remember English newspapers ridiculing Sweden in 1979 for becoming the first nation to outlaw the smacking of children. Now, the UK remains one of the few civilised nations to still indulge in such barbaric behaviour.
In 1972, Sweden also became the first country in the world to allow transsexuals to change their legal gender.
Sweden also has every right to be proud of its efforts on gender equality. There is still a way to go, but Sweden is years ahead of countries such as the UK and USA. Just one look at the number of fathers pushing buggies in any Swedish town centre tells you that.
This is a record of which to be proud. Sweden is a country which promotes tolerance and views bigotry with disdain.
However, Swedes can also be guilty of underplaying their role as one of the world's moral paragons.
It's as if the Swedish nature discourages the natives from being proud of their almost unparalleled civility. ""Surely,"" they seem to think, ""everywhere else is this civilised too.""
But everywhere else is not.

From my personal experience, the vast majority of the refugees that have come to Sweden from benighted countries such as Syria and Afghanistan have been bright, educated, thoughtful people.
They've also been hugely thankful to their host country for taking them in when they needed help.
But it must not be forgotten that there can be significant cultural differences between their own nations and Sweden. And these cultural differences must be recognised and dealt with.
Sweden cannot just leave refugees to it and hope they integrate.
Adherence to the Swedish model must be emphasised right from the start.
Sweden is one of the world's most advanced nations for a good reason – it has followed a progressive social and economic agenda which preaches equality of opportunity.
Gender and sexual equality courses for new arrivals, like those taught in Norway, must be first on the curriculum.

Sweden's status as a liberal powerhouse (socially and economically) must not be endangered by anything.
Not by the far-right in Sweden itself nor by the culturally super-conservative attitudes of a few of the refugees who have made their way here.
Newcomers must understand not only that tolerance is morally positive but that it also leads to a happier and more productive society.
This is also for the benefit of the newcomers. They must not be left to stew in their own resentments as has happened in France and Belgium and parts of Sweden too.
The quicker the newcomers become steeped in Swedish values, the quicker they become valuable and productive members of society.
Those that adapt to Swedish society should be offered a fast-track to training and employment.
And those that refuse to become part of Swedish society, or those who act against the best interests of Swedish society, should be asked to leave.
Sweden's tolerant, advanced society is too precious to endanger by being overly indulgent of those who wish us harm. If a country offers you safe haven, your culture must bend to that nation's culture - not vice versa.
Contrary to the Sweden Democrats and their xenophobic ilk, Sweden needed new blood.
But Sweden must be proactive and make sure that the newcomers become a fresh chapter of Sweden's success story, not a festering footnote of failure."

					15:17 CET+01:00				",AFP/The Local,Sweden sees sharp drop in new refugee arrivals,"The number of asylum seekers arriving in southern Sweden from Denmark dropped sharply on the first day that Sweden imposed systematic ID checks on travellers, police said on Tuesday.
Police in the southern Swedish region of Skåne said they had registered just 48 migrants arriving in Sweden on Monday. Excluding New Year's Day, there had been at least 200 per day since December 29th.
""One can say that it's a sharp drop. But it's only been one day (since the controls were introduced), and we can't exclude that refugees will find other ways of entering Sweden,"" police spokeswoman Ewa-Gun Westford said.
Sweden – which has taken in more asylum seekers per capita than any other EU nation – recently said it could no longer cope with the unregulated flow of arrivals.
In a bid to stem the influx, it has since Monday required all travellers to show photo identification when entering from Denmark, the main entry point for refugees hoping to start a new life in Sweden.
The Swedish coast guard said it was prepared for the possibility that migrants may now try to clandestinely cross the Öresund strait that divides Denmark and Sweden.
""We have to be prepared for the fact that people may seek other routes than the (Öresund) bridge or ferries, regardless of whether it is a Danish network behind this or individual initiatives,"" coast guard spokesman Mattias Lindholm told news agency TT.
Sweden has yet to officially register any migrants arriving on clandestine boats across the Baltic.
An inflatable dinghy discovered in early December on the shores of the southern town of Skillinge raised suspicions of such a crossing, but border police said it was ""very unlikely"" the boat had been used to such ends.
Sweden, a country of 9.8 million inhabitants, received 163,000 asylum applications last year.
More than one million migrants reached Europe in 2015, most of whom were refugees fleeing war and violence in Syria, Afghanistan and Iraq, according to the United Nations refugee agency."

					12:26 CEST+02:00				",Lee Roden,How is Sweden tackling its integration challenge?,"Sweden has received some 280,000 asylum applications since 2014, a significant number for a country of 10 million people. Integrating all of those granted asylum into Swedish society is a big task, so just who exactly is responsible for trying to make that happen? What is being done to pull it off, and what are some of the challenges as well as opportunities created along the way? In the first of our Sweden In Focus series, The Local attempts to answer those questions.
How best to approach asylum policy is arguably the most polarizing issue in Sweden of recent years. It is certainly one of the most important on a political level, exemplified in the rise of the anti-immigration Sweden Democrats. After first entering parliament in the 2010 election with 5.7 percent of votes, they went on to claim almost 13 percent in the 2014 election, and have polled as high as 21 percent since.
The pertinence of the issue can also be seen in the marked change in discourse from the more mainstream parties. That has meant the abandonment of Sweden’s ""open door"" attitude towards asylum seekers and the introduction of border controls designed to keep numbers down. Reports of crime and religious extremism in inner-city suburbs, where the foreign-born population is often high, have gained enough attention that even the country's Social Democrat Prime Minister felt obliged to give a speech on the matter last summer.

Sweden granted protection to 69,350 people last year alone – so the subject is clearly not going to go away. Instead, the question of how best to integrate the newcomers will likely be one of the key points of debate in the 2018 Swedish election.

But what is integration in the first place? Depending on who you ask, the definition can vary. Is a person integrated if they have a home, a job and pay taxes, or is it about something more? Perhaps it's about accepting the social norms of a society?
The Swedish Government department with the prime responsibility for integration is the employment ministry, led by Minister for Employment and Integration Ylva Johansson. In a meeting at the ministry's head office in central Stockholm, Johansson's press secretary Natalie Sial explains their definition of integration:
""For the Red-Green government and Social Democrat leadership, integration means people coming to Sweden being given the right conditions to establish themselves within and become a part of Swedish society.""
""It's about having respect for basic Swedish values – you have both rights and duties here – and also having the right opportunities to establish yourself in Swedish society. The chance to learn the language, start working for example,"" she adds.

The key to newcomers being able to establish themselves within Swedish society is access to employment, the employment ministry believes, after which the process of integration starts to move forward. That explains why the Swedish government handed the overarching responsibility for integration to this department in the first place.

But it's not going to be easy. Figures from Sweden's Public Employment Agency (Arbetsförmedlingen) show that as of March 2017, the unemployment rate among Sweden's foreign-born population was 22.2 percent, compared to 4.1 percent among Sweden-born citizens. The rate is even higher in areas judged by police to be ""particularly vulnerable"".

With many of the people who sought asylum in Sweden during the peak of the refugee crisis in 2015 only now being given their residence permits, the challenge of trying to get them into work is only just beginning. And it's important to understand that those asylum seekers are not a homogeneous group.
Their degree of work experience and education varies from person to person just like any other group of people, which also means the chances of finding work will vary. The Public Employment Agency's attempt to solve that conundrum is the Introduction Programme (Etableringsuppdraget), a plan tailored according to each individual.
So while one newcomer to the country may need further education in order to have the best chance of success in Sweden, another may require work experience. The goal is to best meet each person's needs on an individual level – complicated, but also something Sweden believes will create the best possibility of integrating in the long term.
""The idea is that when the programme is finished the person can then go on to work or pursue further education. And it's important to point out that it's work or studying, because going straight into work isn't always best for a person if they don't have an education suitable for Sweden, which a large section of the people who came here recently don't have,"" Fredrik Möller from the Public Employment Agency’s Integration and Establishment Department tells The Local.

""It's very important for those people to get a good education, because in the long term if they don't have that they won't be an established part of society or a stable part of the labour market. On the other hand, there are people who came with a very high level of education and have worked in advanced jobs like being a surgeon or a teacher. For them, it's important to try and reduce the time before they start working as much as possible,"" he adds.
As such, there is a different programme designed specifically for those newcomers with a good degree of previous skills or education – the ""fast track"" (snabbspår) programme. Created in collaboration between the employment ministry, employers and unions, the fast track programme delivers work experience and training which, when completed, should make it easier for a Swedish employer to accurately weigh up whether a new arrival is suitable for a job.

With the majority of people who sought asylum in Sweden from 2015 onwards only now entering the Public Employment Agency's jurisdiction, just how successful these programmes are will be seen in the long term. It's no secret that long waiting times are a reality of Swedish life – not only for asylum seekers – but when it comes to that group in particular, making the best possible use of their time from the day they first arrive in the country is another key to helping their chances of integrating, the employment ministry's Sial emphasises.
""We've made it so that – with the help of civil society organizations who have been given economic resources to offer language education – people can already start to learn Swedish when they're in an asylum centre. We've also started mapping skills, so that people can easily register what their work experience is as early as possible,"" she says.
Language issues are a major factor in the time it takes for a newcomer to Sweden integrating into the country's labour market, according to Professor Pieter Bevelander, an integration expert from the Malmö Institute of Migration, Diversity and Welfare. On a comparative level Sweden is performing fairly well, he points out, but it could still take as long as a decade for the majority of that group to be integrated.
""The available evidence in Sweden suggests between five and ten years to achieve up to a 60-70 percent employment level. The time is due to language learning, as well as other specific knowledge needed to get a job according to education. Compared to our neighbouring countries of Denmark and Norway, Sweden is mostly doing a bit better in labour market integration of refugees though. It's doing quite well so far, and certainly not worse than its neighbours,"" he says.
Plenty is being done in Sweden to try to aid the side of integration linked to employment, but what about less quantifiable questions of culture and social norms which some would argue are equally important?
It's those things that Mustafa Panshiri focuses on in his work. A former police officer, he recently quit his job to focus full-time on travelling around Sweden and speaking to lone refugee children (more than 37,500 have come to Sweden since 2015) about the process of adapting to their new country. In his opinion, helping the kids to get a proper understanding of Swedish values is vital if they are going to integrate.
""A job is important of course, but integration is also to do with respecting Swedish society's values and rules. What I focus on is what it means for someone who comes from Afghanistan for example to enter a democratic society. How can that transition impact a person's view of life? How can the ideas they bring with them collide with ideas in Sweden? I try to find a common ground between the kids and Swedish society,"" he tells The Local.

Panshiri understands the process better than most. Originally from Afghanistan, he came to Sweden when he was 11, and he tries to tap into his personal experience when helping kids from a similar background who have arrived today.
""In my meetings with the kids I go back and think 'what was weird for me when I came to Sweden?' and start from there. In our conversations I notice it's the same questions they have,"" he explains.
Being a relatable figure also helps.
""When I walk into the room I look like the kids, speak the same language as them. And you know, when we speak about these things – things we take as a given here in Sweden like equality of the sexes, for example – it can be a challenge for them. But that reduces to some degree when they speak with me. I can say to them 'I made that journey'.""
READ ALSO: 'Integration is about more than a job'
In Panshiri's opinion, Sweden has in the past been guilty of not properly addressing the cultural challenges for newcomers. On his Creative Integration (Kreativ Integration) Facebook page, the ex-police officer tries to illustrate the reality of the integration process for these young people – both the positive stories he encounters on a daily basis, and the problems that also arise.
So while there are tales of triumph and inspiring encounters with youngsters, there are also honest accounts of conversations with kids who at first found it difficult to grasp concepts like freedom of expression, only eventually coming round to the idea after a dialogue was created. Integration is sometimes not possible without an initial degree of friction, he argues.
""This subject is very polarized at the moment. On one side there's Donald Trump and Fox News talking about Sweden from afar, and on the other politicians in Sweden saying there's no problem. I try to show that the truth can be found somewhere in the middle, we have to work towards that,"" he says emphatically.
Another person who dedicates time to helping younger refugees with a big challenge in adapting to Sweden is Mohammad Arvan. An actor by trade who moved from Iran to Sweden when he was six, every Wednesday he holds a class in Örebro where asylum seekers can receive advice on how to interact with women according to Swedish social norms.
That's not a trivial subject, Arvan believes, as the home cultures of people who sought asylum in Sweden can sometimes be significantly different to that of their new home when it comes to gender norms.
""The class started because one day one of the refugee kids from Afghanistan asked me about the subject,"" he recalls.
""I think it's good that someone explains these things. They have no idea about it. That's why you see so many stories of things happening at concerts and swimming pools where refugee kids are said to be involved,"" he adds.
With that, Arvan is referring to stories from 2016 of groping among young people at music festivals in Sweden, where newspapers like Dagens Nyheter alleged the perpetrators were young refugee males.
""They ask me stuff like 'if someone is standing at a bar, how should I go forward and speak with her?' Or it could be on the street, in the shops, wherever. How do you start a conversation? Most people think I'm doing a good thing by teaching people how life is here in Sweden.""

For most of us it is probably difficult to grasp the confusion that may be caused for a youngster who, after months or maybe years of fleeing from a troubled country, is then thrust into a culture completely different to theirs, where the social norms and habits are not the ones they are accustomed to from back home.
One of the most innovative attempts to tackle that tricky side of integration for youngsters is Youmo, a recently launched website from Sweden's Youth Guidance Centres (UMOs). Available in the four most commonly spoken languages by new refugee kids in Sweden – Dari, Somalian, Tigrinya and Arabic – as well as English and simple Swedish, the goal is to answer questions they may have about a broad range of subjects, from sexuality to mental health, gender equality and even friendship.
Many of them have fled countries where these subjects are not discussed to a great extent, and as such, Youmo could be the first time they are given vital information.
""We started out with an analysis of what people need to feel secure and strengthen their self-esteem in order to become a part of their new society in a good way. Young people are in many cases keen to become a part of their new country and understand the context, culture and rules,"" Youmo project leader Lotta Nordh Rubulis details to The Local at their office in Södermalm, Stockholm.
A screenshot from the Youmo website. Photo: Youmo
Putting the site together has been an extensive process. Texts were written in Swedish, translated, then cross-checked by a further translator, and also examined by people who are experts in the areas the texts address. On top of that, young asylum seekers were then asked to check the texts to make sure the language has a style that other youngsters would engage with. No stone was left unturned in trying to maximize the possibility of kids actually going on to use the site after its launch.
Some of the most popular pages so far are those with information about making friends in Sweden. Something that could be a big factor for the youngsters one day integrating into Swedish society.
""We can already see from the few statistics we have that exactly those pages about meeting new friends have been really popular. It's a really important issue: it can often be that someone comes here and perhaps lives in a home and is isolated from other Swedish kids as the home is a bit further out of town. So they're very interested in learning how you go about forming friendships,"" Nordh Rubulis explains.
""Many of them have also lived a very gender segregated life and perhaps never had a friend from the opposite sex. It's exciting to see (them learning about that).""
It is hoped that Youmo can ultimately provide reliable answers for the youngsters to both serious questions but also more everyday things in Sweden that they are curious about, and therefore help them to integrate.
The challenges of integrating thousands of newcomers into Swedish society are clearly many then, but what about the opportunities it could also create? One of those is the possibility of providing more blue-collar people to employ, with the Swedish ranks in that category almost exhausted, the Public Employment Agency's Möller explains.
""If you look at the labour market, the pool of Sweden-born working class labour is almost empty. So as a result, we have to try and equip the newcomers to the country as best as possible to take the jobs that are available there.""
Indeed, the agency's director general Mikael Sjöberg recently predicted that Sweden needs as much as 64,000 immigrants annually if it wants to prevent labour shortages from hampering economic growth, in part because the native birth rate is currently too low.

Research suggests that if Sweden can integrate its newcomers into the labour market then it could lead to improved economic growth. A 2016 report by four researchers at Stockholm University into immigration's impact on Sweden's economic development points out that while 15 years ago, Sweden faced the demographic challenge of a population weighted heavily towards those in the 65 plus age bracket, migration between 2000 and 2015 comprised largely of people aged 15-39 means the country's age structure is changing.
""Overall, the results suggest a relatively bright future for Sweden as 15 years of high net immigration have led to an increasing working age population, providing the necessary conditions for significantly faster economic growth than an alternative scenario with lower net immigration,"" the report states in its conclusions.
That's a point that the Employment Ministry's Sial was also keen to highlight:
""We have big ambitions. We don't just want people to work, we need it. In the past there was talk of the generational shift in Sweden. But most of those who have come in recent years are under 40, so it's a very young population. If we get the matching process between people and jobs to work, it'll be a big opportunity for Sweden. But it's important we get it right.""
And that last part is the key. Botch the process of trying to integrate newcomers, and Sweden will not only have wasted money and resources, but it may also further the political fragmentation in the country and increase poverty and crime. Get it right, and in the long run, Sweden could solve some of its big challenges.

Refugees are already known to be at increased risk of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression, but the study, published in the BMJ medical journal this week also showed a higher risk of psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia.
Conducted by researchers at Sweden's Karolinska Institute and University College London, the study used data from 1.3 million teens from the Swedish national register and followed them for 13 years.
The survey group included Swedes with two natural citizen parents, refugees and other migrants, with many originating from the Middle East and north Africa, sub-Saharan Africa, Asia, Eastern Europe and Russia.
The study found that for every 10,000 people, there were approximately four new diagnoses of schizophrenia or other psychotic disorders among Swedish-born people per year.
But among non-refugee migrants that figure was eight, and 12 among refugees.
The findings applied to both men and women, but was most pronounced for men.
""The dramatically increased risk among refugees shows that life events are a significant risk factor for schizophrenia,"" Anna-Clara Hollander, the study's lead author from Karolinska's Department of Public Health Sciences, said in a statement.

Schizophrenia is a chronic, often debilitating illness. Symptoms often include hallucinations, delusions and paranoia.
The disease usually starts during the transition to adulthood and is thought to be provoked by genetic as well as social circumstances.
Traumatic events such as persecution, conflict or natural disasters contribute to the risk of developing disorders, Hollander said.
""We know that refugees are a vulnerable group, facing many social, economic, physical and mental health challenges in their lives,"" said co-author James Kirkbride from University College London Psychiatry.
The study, he said, highlights ""the need for specialist care and support. In most countries refugees undergo standard health checks, but mental health issues can be overlooked"".
The research was conducted using Swedish national registry data up until December 2011, so it does not include recent migrants.
But there is nothing to suggest that people displaced by recent conflicts will be any less vulnerable than those granted refugee status in the past, according to the study.
Sweden took in a record batch of asylum seekers in 2015, receiving 163,000 applications.
However it has seen the number of migrant arrivals fall sharply since it introduced police border controls in November, followed by passenger ID checks at ferry terminals and Copenhagen Airport's train station at the turn of the year."

The fire was attended by 20 firefighters. The building, part of the otherwise demolished Furulidsskolan, was to be prepared to greet asylum seekers in the affluent area of Kungsbacka.
“Half the building has been damaged by fire,” said Mikael Lindgren, lead operator of the emergency services in Greater Gothenburg.
The cause of the fire is unclear but police will cordon off the area and carry out a technical examination when the emergency services have finished making the property secure.
The fire occurred just a day after a school, just south of Ljungby in Småland, was also destroyed by fire. The school building was to be used to accommodate refugees and had recently been decorated.
On Tuesday night a building in Arlöv in Skåne, designed for unaccompanied refugee children, was badly damaged. The centre was due to be open to the children the following day.
Two months ago, two other refugee centres were the targets of arson attacks.
There have been a suspected 14 arson attacks on asylum centres since the start of the year.
As The Local has previously reported, more refugees have sought asylum in Sweden so far in 2015 than in any other year in the Nordic nation's history.
Last week Migrationsverket revealed that a total of 86,223 people had launched cases so far in 2015, surpassing a previous record set in 1992 when 84,016 people asked for asylum following fighting in the Balkans."

					18:01 CEST+02:00				",TT/The Local,Why Sweden could deport hundreds of refugee children,"Several hundred lone refugee children could now be sent home from Sweden due to a change in how the rule on exceptional circumstances is applied when making asylum decisions.
Minors refused asylum in Sweden cannot be directly sent back to any country where there is no orderly system of processing them back in, but several are now due for deportation.
That is down to a new position adopted by the Swedish migration agency (Migrationsverket) from April this year onwards which alters how case workers should think when working with young people in the category.
The migration agency's legal department has decreed that 16 and 17-year-olds who are not considered to have grounds for asylum but who are also not able to be sent home directly can be given temporary residence permits in Sweden before being deported when they turn 18.
According to the migration authority's Director of Legal Affairs the agency has clarified when the rules about exceptionally distressful circumstances should be applied in cases of lone refugee children seeking asylum.
“We and our experts saw that our people in the authority were having a difficult time applying this rule, which often ended up in them giving out permanent residency due to especially distressing circumstances. What we now say is that the rule should not be automatically applied, but rather the individual case and the links to Sweden that the young person has should determine it,” Fredrik Beijer told Swedish news agency TT.
Swedish public service broadcaster Sveriges Radio spoke to one minor who had his asylum application rejected.
“The crux of the decision is that they will keep me here until I am 18 then send me back to Afghanistan,” 17-year-old Mohammad Nabavi told the station's Ekot show.
Nabavi was born as a refugee in Iran and has never been in Afghanistan. According to the old application of the rule he and others in similar situations would likely have been allowed to stay in Sweden."

Riksgränsen, which sits 200 kilometres above the Arctic Circle close to Sweden's border with Norway, is set to welcome the refugees following a deal between the resort's owner and the Swedish Migration Agency, Migrationsverket.
""As everyone knows, there is a refugee crisis in the world. Now asylum seekers are arriving in Sweden and Migrationsverket has a major urgent need to find temporary housing to accommodate all those who need help. We at Lapland Resorts AB are very pleased to be able to help,"" Sven Kuldkepp, CEO of Lapland Resorts, told Swedish newspaper Norrbottenskuriren via email on Wednesday.
""Why leave it empty and cold when it can be quite full and warm,"" he added in a separate comment.
Kuldepp explained that the refugees would be allowed to stay in Riksgränsen until February 2016, when the main tourist ski season would get under way.
He said that the plan would ""not affect our ordinary activities"" but added that he hoped that his resort would also be able to create jobs for some of the asylum seekers.
The move comes amid a push from Sweden's Social Democrat-led government to encourage municipalities across Sweden to take in more refugees.
At the moment, the vast majority of asylum seekers end up in either Stockholm, Gothenburg or Malmö.
But Northern Sweden is becoming a more common base for asylum seekers. On Friday a group of 19 Eritreans landed in Luleå and were taken to Östersund as part of the first phase of a programme to relocate tens of thousands of refugees within the EU.
However some campaigners have raised concerns about people raised in Africa or the Middle East adapting to the dark and freezing conditions in the region.
In January, a group of refugees taken to a housing centre near Östersund initially refused to get off a bus after claiming that they had been told by officials that they would be living close to Stockholm and instead finding themselves driven 15 hours north.
""We were coming to an area in the middle of the forest we know nothing about, just snow and wind and nothing else,"" Esam Taha, 36, from Syria, told The Local this week, reflecting on the chaos.
""It was terrible, just wind and snow, and the roads were slippery. The moment we got out of the bus we slipped and fell down,"" he explained.
But the asylum seeker says he now expects to settle in the area and argues that other refugees might not find it too tricky to adapt to the frozen north.
""If I find an apartment in Östersund, of course I will stay here, because all my friends are here, all my Swedish friends are here. This city is a small city and a quiet city, and the people here are really really nice and I like it, but it's a big problem to find an apartment,"" he said.
Taha added that he was studying at a riding and hunting centre and volunteering at a school while he waited for his residency to be approved.
More refugees have sought asylum in Sweden so far in 2015 than in any other year in the Nordic nation's history, new figures released by the country's Migration Agency revealed on Monday.
86,223 people have launched cases, surpassing a previous record set in 1992 when 84,016 people sought asylum following fighting in the Balkans.
Officials in the Swedish capital announced on Monday that they were planning to build a new refugee reception zone around the city's central station, while Prime Minister Stefan Löfven said last week that tent camps would likely be needed in order to provide enough shelter for new arrivals reaching Sweden as the winter sets in."

The Nordic nation granted protection to 7,040 asylum applicants per million of its population in 2016 – the highest number of all Member States – followed by Germany with 5,420 per million residents, and Austria with 3,655 per million.
The UK by comparison granted protection to 260 applicants per million of its population. Poland granted the fewest proportionally – only 10 per million people.
In total, Sweden made the second highest number of positive decisions on applications for protection from any EU Member State with 69,350 in 2016 – double the number of 2015. Germany is the country that made the most positive decisions with 445,210, accounting for 60 percent of the positive decisions granted across the EU.
Sweden processed 112,000 asylum claims in 2016 as it worked to clear the bulk of a backlog built up during the peak of the refugee crisis. The country's Migration Agency (Migrationsverket) expects to process less in 2017 – 95,000.

Eurostat's numbers suggest Sweden is not quite as permissive as it may appear to be however, at least comparatively. It granted asylum at the first request in 69 percent of instances, the same approval rate as Germany but less than the Netherlands (72 percent) and Austria (72 percent).
For applications where a decision was appealed, that rate dropped significantly, and Sweden only granted asylum in 25 percent of those cases. That's a lower rate than Cyprus (49 percent), the UK (52 percent), the Netherlands (58 percent) and Bulgaria (65 percent).

The same night a centre for unaccompanied refugee children and young people in Värnamo was the target of an arson attack.
Following a tip-off, police found two unknown objects in the vicinity of the Arboga accommodation.
“Late on Friday night they found the first object and the second some time after midnight,” said Thomas Gustafsson, police spokesman in Västmanland.
A large area was cordoned off and bomb technicians from Stockholm were called.
“As a precaution it was decided that the accommodation would be evacuated,” Gustafsson told the Swedish TT news agency.
Staff from the Swedish Migration Board (Migrationsverket) and Arboga municipality removed the 83 residents and took them to a local church.
Bomb technicians found that the objects consisted of two sacks of flammable liquid. Police have launched a preliminary investigation.
Passers-by managed to extinguish the fire at a separate centre in Värnamo before the emergency services arrived. Twenty children and young people, between the ages of 15 to 21, were living there. Nobody was hurt.
“It was a resourceful intervention by passers-by that ensured the fire was stopped early,” said a police spokesman.
“We have undertaken an investigation and can conclude that the fire was not an accident. It has been classified as arson although we do not yet have any suspects.”
The attacks come just five days after a mother and her adult son were stabbed to death at an Ikea store in the central town of Västerås. Two men from Eritrea were arrested with one admitting the attack and another denying all involvement.
Earlier this month two EU migrants were injured and four caravans burned when a camping site in Gothenburg was attacked.
Violence against ethnic minorities is growing in Sweden with other high profile cases in recent months including shots fired at two homeless EU migrants sleeping in a car in Boden in northern Sweden and two migrants assaulted in central Stockholm by a passerby who threw acid at them."

The poll by Sifo, published in the Svenska Dagbladet newspaper, found 41 percent of respondents said Sweden should grant fewer residency permits to refugees -- compared to just 29 percent in September.
Of the 1,000 people questioned between November 2nd and 5th, a quarter wanted the number to remain at current levels, while 17 percent wanted an increase and 16 percent were undecided.
Sweden has taken more refugees per capita than any other country in Europe as the continent struggles with its worst migration crisis since World War Two, and is expecting up to 190,000 asylum seekers this year.
""When we polled opinion in September, the developments and the debate were completely different. Today the prime minister (Stefan Löfven) is asking to redistribute (in the European Union) the refugees who have come here,"" said Toivo Sjören, head of polling at Sifo.
An Ipsos poll published on Saturday in Sweden's Dagens Nyheter newspaper similarly indicated a shift in attitudes, suggesting 26 percent think the Scandinavian country should welcome more migrants, down from 44 percent in September.
Men and right-wing voters tended to take more negative views of migrants, with 96 percent of the far-right Sweden Democrats' supporters saying fewer should be granted residency.
Rising opposition to the newcomers can also be seen on social media.
According to a study conducted by Svenska Dagbladet, 35 percent of the most shared posts on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram containing the Swedish word for ""refugees"" expressed a negative opinion about the issue in October, compared to 21 percent in September.

“The Finns have signs such as ‘Go home Isis,' "" a photographer Bob Olovsson also told the newspaper.
Police tried to keep order on the border between Sweden and Finland, which is situated at the top of the Bothnian Gulf where the towns of Haparanda (Sweden) and Tornio (Finland) sit side-by-side.
Linder told Expressen: “There are a few on the Swedish side, and roughly 600 on the Finnish side. But it is a passive demonstration at present to not to let refugees cross the border.”
Olovsson added: “There are lots of Finnish flags, Finnish hockey shirts and signs with messages in English such as 'Go home Isis' and similar things.”
""That's enough now, close the borders,"" was written on one of the banners.
Peter Waara, the Social Democrat mayor of Haparanda, said: “There were right-wing extremists gathered at the bus station in Haparanda. When I left, the place was quiet, but police were still there.”
According to police, the demonstrations were conducted without violence. At 1pm, the police presence was removed as most of the demonstrators had left.
Finnish Broadcasting Corporation (Yle) has estimated that around 1,000 refugees a week are currently crossing into Finland at the border at Haparanda.
Finland expects a total of 25,000 to 30,000 asylum seekers this year, seven to eight times as many as in 2014.
The Finnish government on Thursday said it would step up controls at the border with Sweden following a spike in mostly Iraqi asylum seekers, many of whom had simply walked into Tornio from Haparanda after arriving in the country.
Up to 800 people entered Tornio on Friday alone, the largest number of refugees to arrive in the country on a single day since the Russian Revolution, according to figures from the Red Cross cited on Yle.
Last week, Finland agreed to accept its two percent share of the 120,000 asylum seekers to be relocated across European Union states, but said it remained opposed to a mandatory quotas.
Authorities are set to open a registration office for asylum seekers at a disused high school in Tornio on Tuesday."

The anti-immigration Sweden Democrats scored 18.9 percent, the largest figure they have got so far in a poll by Ipsos.
Meanwhile the poll, commissioned by Swedish newspaper Dagens Nyheter, suggested that the ruling coalition parties, the Social Democrats and the Greens had lost the support of around half a million Swedish voters and would score just 37.3 percent of the vote if there was an election now.
According to analysts at Ipsos, support for the country's opposition centre-right Alliance parties has barely shifted, with around 41.3 percent of voters likely to choose them.
The polling was carried out between December 3rd and December 14th, after the Swedish government announced a shock tightening of asylum rules in a bid to stem the influx of refugees to the Nordic nation.
The move has led to a fall in the number of people registered by Sweden's Migration Agency (Migrationsverket). While in October around 10,000 people were registered in a week, Migrationsverket statistics suggest that 4,721 people sought asylum across Sweden during the first seven days of December.
Tommy Möller, a professor of political science at Stockholm University, told the TT news agency that the results bucked the common trend of voters increasing their support for a ruling government during a national crisis.
""Some of the voters seem to think that while Sweden has a refugee crisis, the government itself created it by attracting refugees,"" he said.
The expert noted that the Sweden Democrats had managed to gain votes, despite ""the other parties now effectively approaching their standpoint"".

Migration Minister Morgan Johansson told a press conference on Friday that the government was looking at a range of options to house refugees, including using empty jails. Sweden has closed down several prisons in the past few years because of falling crime rates.
""We're looking at properties owned by the Prison and Probation Service and the Armed Forces,"" said Johansson.
Other actions that could be taken are increased coordination with the Swedish Migration Agency, the Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency, and municipalities across the country to make sure that the new arrivals find somewhere to live.

""We want, through advertisements in foreign newspapers, describe that the utopia they want to come to in Sweden no longer exists. Here, it's tent camps, winter and cold,"" said party leader Jimmie Åkesson and added that he had been inspired by a similar drive by the Danish government this autumn.
Åkesson said he would also encourage elected party members to spend less active time in parliament and more on the street canvassing support for an anti-immigration referendum.
""We're turning the party into election mode,"" he told reporters, saying he was hoping to pressure Sweden's centre-right majority opposition in particular into backing his policies.
But Sweden's second-largest party, the Moderates, had little love lost for the nationalists' campaign, criticizing them for focusing on policital slogans rather than substance.
""What the Sweden Democrats are doing is switching from a parliamentary organization to a more or less tax-funded campaign organization. I don't think that impresses voters.

""It was a collective assessment that was made. We didn't want to take any risks,"" Falun municipality's coordinator for child refugees Kjell Nordqvist told broadcaster SVT.
While no specific threat against the shelter was made, the municipality considered links between the NRM and home-made bomb attacks on centres for asylum seekers in Gothenburg from earlier this year to be enough to justify taking the precaution.
""Because we know there are links between the NRM and the bombings that occurred in Gothenburg against refugee centres not long ago, we were obliged to act,"" Nordqvist said.

Sweden's Prime Minister Stefan Löfven released a written statement on Wednesday asking the commission to push other EU member states to do more to help tackle the refugee crisis.
""Sweden has long taken an unreasonably large responsibility in comparison with other countries in the EU, and now we are in a very tight position. It is time that other countries now take responsibility and therefore the government requests the redistribution of refugees from Sweden,"" he said.
The EU has already launched a refugee relocation programme designed to move refugees from overstretched frontline states.
Sweden has previously offered to take in some of this number and in early October received a group of Eritrean asylum seekers who had been living in Italy.
However, the country has since doubled its refugee forecast for 2015, with up to 190,000 new arrivals expected on Swedish soil before the end of the year.
The original EU plan was also to have seen 54,000 migrants and refugees relocated from Hungary. But several eastern European states, including Hungary, rejected the compulsory quota plan out of hand, with Sweden now keen to take advantage of the offer made to Budapest for relocating some of its own asylum seekers.
""We reached a point where we cannot receive people in the way that we want to do and the way we were used to,"" Löfven later told a news conference in Stockholm with European Council President Donald Tusk.
Tusk expressed understanding of Sweden's position, saying it made sense to offer such support.
""Sweden is the most affected country in Europe when it comes to refugees and asylum seekers per capita. Because we have this reserve, because of the Hungarian decision, I'm absolutely sure that Sweden deserves this support from our side,"" he said.
The Swedish government a fortnight ago reached a deal with the country's major opposition parties following rising concerns about the country's ability to handle the rising numbers of new asylum seekers. The politicians agreed that some of the incoming refugees should be given temporary rather than permanent residence permits.
Following the cross-party talks, the politicians also agreed to make it mandatory for all local authorities to take in a share of refugees, as some reported being unable to cope with the swelling numbers of new arrivals. A 10 billion kronor grant is to be shared between Sweden's councils in 2015 to help them cope with the influx.
Last year Sweden took in more asylum seekers per capita than any other EU country and it remains among the member states with the highest proportion of refugees in relation to its population, as the continent continues to struggle with a massive influx of migrants."

More than 800 people, including staff and contractors, were hit when Northland Resources, which had sparked a business boom when it opened the iron ore mine in the town of Pajala in 2012, filed for bankruptcy just two years later.
The mine was closed and its old offices are now being rented out to Sweden's migration agency Migrationsverket. But some hope that the Sweden's refugee crisis could lead to a silver lining for the town, where unemployment at 9.1 percent exceeds the Swedish average of 7.8 percent.
""It has created 70 new jobs,"" Social Democrat councillor Harry Rantakyrö told the TT newswire about the 700 asylum seekers placed by migration officials in the town of 6,200 residents.
He hopes that some of the new arrivals will choose to stay in Pajala, 10 kilometres from the border to Finland, after they are granted asylum. Like many other rural towns, it has been suffering from a dwindling population, which was only briefly interrupted during its brief booming mining years.

Rantakyrö, who lost his job when the mine closed, still remembers, one and a half years on, how Northland Resource's bankruptcy brought the isolated town from boom to bust.
""There had been a constant state of decommissioning here, and then we had development. People started moving to the village. We're now back on square one again. But we have to look towards the future,"" he said, mentioning wind power and tourism projects with Finland as two ways forward.

""But then I have to find a job here,"" he said.

Swedes reacted to the peak of the refugee crisis in 2015 by making charity donations to the sum of 19.4 billion kronor – a 1.5 billion kronor increase on 2014. But comparing this week’s Inizio poll to a similar one from a year ago suggests that willingness to help has reduced.
While the majority of respondents still said they want to contribute to some extent, their commitment has weakened: 30 percent said they “definitely” wanted to help, and 26 percent said “maybe”.
Last year, by comparison, 54 percent said they “definitely” wanted to help and 12 percent said “maybe”. The number of people answering that they did not want to help meanwhile is up to 21 percent from 11 percent in 2015.
A more dramatic shift has occurred in how many refugees Swedes think should be taken into the country going forward. In last year’s edition of the survey, 34 percent said that Sweden should take in fewer, but this year that had increased significantly to 60 percent.
Only 13 percent said that more refugees should be accepted meanwhile, down from 31 percent in 2015.
“We have taken in many refugees who have not yet been integrated, and the debate is ongoing. Many people in the survey wondered how taking even more in would work. Some also think that other countries should take more responsibility,” Inizio pollster Karin Nelsson explained to Aftonbladet.
As for how the Swedish population views the state’s response to the refugee crisis: 65 percent now say they have little confidence in how the Swedish government has approached the situation, compared to just under half (48 percent) at this time last year.
That decrease in confidence comes despite a toughened stance from Sweden, which has tightened residency laws and introduced border controls on the southern boundary with Denmark in the last 12 months."

The government agency had previously predicted that 12,000 children and young adults would arrive in Sweden without a parent or other older relative.
But it has now revealed a new estimate of 30,000 to Swedish tabloid Expressen and public broadcaster SVT.
The announcement comes as Sweden struggles to find accommodation for record numbers of refugee arrivals of all ages.
Migrationsverket recently sent out a nationwide appeal for local councils and businesses to provide shelter as winter sets in.
But while theatres, sports centres and even a ski resort have opened their doors to refugees, the situation is much more complicated when it comes to unaccompanied children, as Swedish authorities seek to find them both foster care and schooling.
“More and more [local authorities] say they will be hard pressed to do it,"" Per-Arne Andersson, head of department at the Swedish Association of Local Authorities and Regions (SKL) was quoted as saying by the TT news agency on Wednesday.
He said that only around 40 percent of children arriving in Sweden were able to be placed with friends or acquaintances, explaining that the rest of the arrivals of unaccompanied minors were distributed around the country, with some municipalities taking in a greater share than others.
“The situation does not look like is set to change, rather to continue,” he added.

In 2014, 7,049 children travelled solo to Sweden and sought asylum, an increase of more than 80 percent on 2013.

They'll be based at Gothenburg University which has told The Local it's working to expand the programme nationwide.
The academics have been given the opportunity to continue research they started in their home countries and could also teach students in the future, staff at the university in western Sweden have revealed.
In addition, the pair have been offered accommodation and are being encouraged to participate in workshops and seminars on campus.
""We see them as guest researchers (...) and they will be paid a salary,"" Helena Lindholm, Gothenburg University's Vice Chancellor, told The Local.
She expained that the duo would be based in the Social Sciences and Humanities departments, but said that their names were not currently being made public in order to ensure their safety.
The initiative was organized via Scholars at Risk (SAR), an international network of some 400 higher education institutions dedicated to protecting threatened scholars and promoting academic freedom worldwide. These include those who could face intimidation or censorship as well as people who have fled abroad because of general violence in their home country.
Despite Sweden being among the EU states with the highest proportion of refugees per capita, it is the first time that a Swedish university has accepted academic staff directly through SAR.
""Among the refugees there are of course scholars, scientists and researchers who are in need of places to be to continue their work (...) we support academic freedom,"" said Lindholm.
The Vice Chancellor said that Gothenburg University was hoping to take in another ""one or two"" academics in 2016.
She is also leading efforts to encourage other Swedish universities in the SAR network to offer similar sanctuary, and said that she felt it was ""only a matter of time"" before more institutions followed Gothenburg's example.
Refugee academics seeking to participate in the programme are encouraged to make their cases directly to SAR, which will then work with further education bodies to try to match them to universities and departments.

Since spring 2016, the number of applications has stabilized at 1700-2500 per month, the lowest figures since 2012.
""It's mainly a more impenetrable Europe, the agreement between EU and Turkey, border and ID controls, and the temporary law that has led to this development,"" Migrationsverket stated.

The forecast for 2018 is between 25,000 and 65,000 asylum seekers.
Migrationsverket was unable to say what effect Sweden's temporary asylum law has had. The law, which came into force in July 2016 and will remain in place for three years, only grants temporary residence permits to persons who have been granted refugee status, and limits family reunifications.

Migrationsverket aims to process all 163,000 asylum applications from 2016, as well as the 29,000 from 2016, before the end of this year. That target remains in place, even though the forecast of applications that will be processed in 2017 has been reduced from 105,000 to 95,000.
""This is due to the complexity of the cases. We've seen an increase in the share of complex cases concerning Syria, Afghanistan, Iraq and Iran,"" said Migrationsverket's director-general, Mikael Ribbenvik.
Meanwhile, Sweden's local authorities are expected to house 82,600 newly-arrived people who have been granted residence permits this year.
""It's a pressured situation. We're getting signals from many municipalities that are having difficulties managing,"" Ribbenvik said.
As Migrationsverket is forecast to process fewer asylum applications in 2017 than its original target, the number of deportation cases is thought to land at 24,700, which is 8000 fewer than forecast in February.
The number of people voluntarily leaving Sweden is forecast at 10,500 this year, or 3200 fewer compared to previous forecasts.
Around 2700 deportation cases are expected to be handed over to the police, with an additional 8300 deportation cases expected to be handed over to the police due to the rejected asylum seekers having gone into hiding."

While commending Sweden's efforts to help asylum seekers and refugees, particularly at the peak of arrivals in 2015, the Commissioner for Human Rights Nils Muiznieks said in a report he was ""concerned at the restrictions introduced"".
Sweden has registered around 400,000 asylum requests since 2012, or one for every 25 inhabitants, a record in Europe.
Asylum applications, a third of which were from Syrians, hit a peak of 163,000 in 2015.
But to stem the influx of people and ease the strain on accommodation centres, migration offices and social affairs, Sweden in January 2016 reintroduced systematic identity checks on its border with Denmark, as well as a series of restrictions aimed at deterring other migrants.

Muiznieks said he was ""notably concerned at the impact"" of an amended law that enables Swedish authorities to deprive rejected asylum seekers – who have no children with them and must leave the country – of accommodation, allowance and subsidized medical care.
He also expressed worries over restrictions on the right to family reunifications.
""The Commissioner urges the Swedish authorities to ensure that refugees and other beneficiaries of international protection fully enjoy their right to family reunification and expresses the hope that the restrictions to the right to family reunification in particular will be lifted on the occasion of the mid-review of the temporary law in 2018,"" the 29-page report said.
'Benefit of the doubt'
In 2015, one in five asylum seekers applied as unaccompanied minors, many of whom where from Afghanistan.
To determine the age of young applicants arriving without identification papers, the Swedish Migration Agency has since May 2017 introduced voluntary dental X-rays and magnetic resonance imaging of the knee joints.

Muiznieks called on Swedish authorities ""not to rely only on a medical assessment of age"" and ""to ensure that minors are always given the benefit of the doubt where there is uncertainty as to their age"".
The commissioner cited a report by the UN Committee on the Right of the Child which found such medical exams had ""wide margins of error"".
Meanwhile, the report noted Sweden was ""close to achieving its commitment"" of taking in 3,766 migrants in 2017 under relocation quotas set between EU member states.

Fire and rescue services were called out to a fire at a former pre-school in Danderyd north of Stockholm in the early hours of Wednesday morning, just a day after the local authority announced the building was going to be turned into temporary accommodation for around 70 asylum seekers.
No one was injured in the blaze and it was put out before firefighters arrived on the scene.
It is the latest in a string of more than a dozen fires at buildings earmarked for asylum accommodation since the summer, which has already prompted police to step up their presence at centres across Sweden as concerns over the safety of refugees in the Nordic country grow.
Sweden's security police, Säpo, has been called in to help investigate if the suspected arson attacks could be linked to far-right activities.
Meanwhile, the Swedish national Migration Agency moved on Wednesday to keep the locations of future similar facilities secret out of fear of further attacks.
“It should not be possible to get a complete list of addresses to asylum housing,” Mikael Ribbenvik, chief operative officer at the Migration Agency, told the Dagens Nyheter (DN) newspaper on Wednesday.

Some of the information will still be available locally, but several municipalities across Sweden have already chosen not to disclose the locations of new asylum centres due to threats.
Umeå council said a week ago that they would not reveal where 150 refugees set to arrive in the northern Swedish town would be housed.
“The risk is that thugs decide to burn down the premises here as well,” Ewa Klingfors, director of Umeå's social services, told regional newspaper Västerbottens-kuriren at the time.
The anti-immigration Sweden Democrat party has faced criticism after a local branch in Lund published a list of prospective refugee centres on Facebook. A party spokesman dismissed the idea that revealing the information would increase the risk of new attacks, but Ribbenvik criticized the move.
“You must ask them what the purpose is. We certainly don't want to contribute to facilitate that type of map survey,"" he told DN.
Meanwhile, police believe one of the fires at a centre in Munkedal in south-western Sweden – which was hit twice in a week – last week began inside the building. Suspected arson is still being investigated.
Sweden expects to receive up to 190,000 asylum applications this year – putting it among the EU states with the highest proportion of refugees per capita.

Hundreds of people have already pledged their support to the protest against the recent rise in migrants arriving in Torneå in Finland from twin city Haparanda in northern Sweden, by joining a Facebook event for the demonstration.
But those in favour of maintaining freedom of movement have been quick to arrange their own alternative demonstration in an attempt to show the world that not all Lapland residents back efforts to prevent refugees from travelling between the two countries.
Adam Huuva, one of the organizers, told Swedish broadcaster SVT on Tuesday that locals ""lived off the borderless"" feel of the area and said he found it strange that some had therefore sought to campaign against this amid the hike in new arrivals from war-torn nations.
Finland is experiencing an unexpected influx of migrants on its border with Sweden, mostly Iraqi asylum seekers hoping to reunite with friends and family.
So far this year more than 13,000 asylum seekers arrived in the Nordic nation compared to just 3,600 in the whole of last year.
While Sweden takes in more asylum seekers per capita than any other EU nation and has pledged to offer a home to all Syrians fleeing conflict in their home country, Finland has been granting asylum to a higher percentage of Iraqis (45 percent during the first half of this year) compared to Sweden (33 percent).
However a vocal minority of Finns have demonstrated their hostility to the rising number of new arrivals in recent weeks.
Earlier this month protestors in Torneå linked arms at the border to try to stop refugees from crossing into Finland, with some spotted holding banners reading signs such as 'Go home Isis'.

One of the protesters could be seen dressed in a white hood – a symbol of the racist American Ku Klux Klan – with a Finnish flag in his hand.
Prime Minister Juha Sipila condemned the attack on Twitter, saying ""threats and violence against asylum seekers and migrants are absolutely unacceptable"".
However, Finland was the only European Union state to abstain from last week's vote about relocating asylum seekers across the member countries.
It accepted its two percent share of 120,000 asylum seekers in question but said it was opposed to a mandatory quota system.

A court in Umeå in the north of Sweden found the woman guilty of embezzlement and breach of trust, court documents seen by The Local show.
The court documents note that the 67-year-old woman ""had had a gambling problem for several years, which she had lost control of"", and that the stolen money was used to fund this habit.
In total, the woman transferred almost 100,000 kronor ($11,900) from the bank account of the boy, who received the money from a summer job, study grants, and social services. Some of the payments were made directly to her own bank accounts, others were made to a fintech company which handles payments for several gaming websites.
Between June 2014 and October 2015, the woman had acted as a trustee for the child who was living in Nordmaling on Sweden's northeastern coast, before being appointed his legal guardian. She held the latter role until August 2016, when the boy's family came from Somalia to join him.
She admitted making 29 transfers from the boy's account, but also claimed to have paid back more than half of the money to the boy.

With tourism season fast approaching, the industry says it is not currently informed of the government's plans regarding the large number of facilities that have been transformed into asylum accommodations, according to a report by Svenska Dagbladet.
Neither Migrationsverket, Visit Sweden or the hotel and restaurant industry's trade association Visita are able to provide specific information about the loss of facilities, and tourism organisations are in the dark as to the capacity they will be operating at this year.
“Some municipalities have no beds at all - clearly, tourism is going to be affected,” Lena Larsson, CEO at Småland Tourism, told Svenska Dagbladet.
For example, major attraction Astrid Lindgren World is expected to be without quality facilities, with both its guesthouse and hostel expected to continue to be used as asylum facilities in the summer.
Last November, the theme park even opened its doors out-of-season to allow refugee children to come and play for a day.
But voices within the tourism industry are now unsure what Migrationsverket's use of hotels and similar accommodation will mean for them in the long term.
“Hotels are the engine of tourism. If we don't have them, we lose all other tourist revenues,” Lars-Eric Fällt of Södra Bohusläns Tourism told Svenska Dagbladet.
Fällt said that he believed many tourist facilities - particularly those in remote parts of the country - that are now being used by the state are unlikely to be returned.
Some facilities have also been taken over by new companies who intend to rent them to the state. Turning tourist accommodation into asylum accommodation is reported to increase its turnover, but does not take into account effects on the tourist industry.
“Many of us in Österlen have gone over to this [renting to the government],” hostel owner Maria Karlsson told Svenska Dagbladet. “It is basically the same type of business, but with better remuneration. I have a contract for six months at a time with revenue similar to the high season.”
Migrationsverket states that it currently has 370 different asylum shelters across the country of which the ‘vast majority' are former hotels and hostels. But the agency told Svenska Dagbladet that it does not consider it within its remit to provide information on exactly which tourism businesses are being affected.
With Migrationsverket last week announcing the renewal of contracts for up to 60,000 beds, the long-term consequences for Sweden's tourism remain unclear."

Better Shelter, developed in collaboration with the IKEA Foundation and UNHCR, is a flatpack design which can be erected by four adults in four hours, and which can comfortably house a family of five.
While at $1,250, the hut costs twice as much as a standard refugee shelter, but is designed to last for at least three years, and provides a lockable door, stab-proof plastic cladding, and electricity through a solar generator.

The agency now says it is calculating on 60,000 refugees making their way to Sweden, or 100,000 at the very most.
Previously it had set 140,000 new arrivals as the upper limit.
“We see every day how people are making their way from Turkey to Greece or across the sea to Italy, but they are not currently reaching Sweden,” said the agency’s operations manager, Mikael Ribbenvik, in a statement.
The agency also revised downward its estimate of how much money it would need after the historic spike in asylum seeker arrivals last autumn. With fewer applications expected this year, the agency wants 54.7 billion kronor ($6.7 billion) from the government to fund its operations, a drop of 6.4 billion on the previous forecast.
A country of 9.8 million, Sweden took in more than 160,000 asylum seekers in 2015, putting it among the EU states with the highest proportion of refugees per capita.
In October 10,000 refugees were arriving every week. The figures dropped sharply at the start of this year as Sweden and other EU countries tightened border controls, while poor weather conditions in the Mediterranean led to fewer crossings.
Since the migration agency made its last prediction in February the so-called Balkan Route has become impenetrable for refugees and a controversial EU deal has come into force that keep more asylum seekers in Turkey.
In the first three months of this year 9,000 people applied for asylum in Sweden, compared to 13,000 in the same period last year.
The United Nations refugee agency UNHCR says the number of refugees arriving in Greece from Turkey has fallen from 870 a day in March to 130 a day in April.
The reduction is mainly attributed to the EU-Turkey deal, which returns refugees from Greece to Turkey unless they want to apply for asylum in the EU country. Most don’t, as this would prevent them from submitting applications in countries like Germany and Sweden which are seen as being more attractive."

Under a ""No money, no jobs, no homes"" headline, a gloomy message from a group describing itself as ""Sweden Democrats, SD-Women and The People of Sweden"", is meant to discourage refugees from travelling to Sweden.
The flyer claims massive immigration has caused ""grenade attacks in public spaces"" and ""a very high number of shootings and gang related violence”. It also claims that halal slaughter and wearing Islamic veils will be forbidden – despite the fact that these policies are not backed by most political parties and have no prospect of becoming law.

The comparable figure for the overall population of immigrants that arrived in Sweden that same year is 63 percent.
""I think the results for Balkan migrants would have been even better if there had been an earlier focus on jobs and linking employment with knowledge of the Swedish language,"" Integration Minister Erik Ullenhag told the TT news agency on Monday when presenting the figures.
More than 60,000 refugees came to Sweden in 1994.
Many were fleeing what Ullenhag called “the most devastating conflict in Europe since the second world war,” as he presented an overview of Balkan refugees' current well-being on Monday.
The 1994 surge was more than double the 25,000 people who arrived here in need of shelter in 2012, many of them from Syria.
The review, put together by Statistics Sweden (Statistiska centralbyrån, SCB), examined the integration process by highlighting how an increasing proportion of refugees found their way into employment as the years went by.
After six years in Sweden, for example, 65 percent of men from the Balkans had found work. Four years later, after a decade in Sweden, that number had gone up by 9 percentage points to 74 percent.
For women from the Balkans, the hike between six years and ten years spent in Sweden was 15 percentage points – fom 51 percent to 66. Yet that figure then levelled out when looking at employment statistics after 15 years spent in the country.
For men, meanwhile, employment fell somewhat from 74 percent to 72 when comparing employment after ten and 15 years in the country.
The report also showed a clear link between education levels and employment, as the gap between Balkan refugees and workers born in Sweden widened considerably among those who had not finished their high school studies.
Only one in five of the Balkan refugees with only compulsory education were employed in 2011, while about seven out of ten people born in Sweden had found work – a 22-percentage point gap.
Employment figures for refugees with higher degrees was 79 percent compared to 91 percent among those born in Sweden, a 12-percentage point gap.
Furthermore, the report showed clearly that refugees who arrived in Sweden when they were young fared better than their older peers.
The integration minister said there needed to more focus on getting newly-arrived migrants to Sweden into the labour market quickly.
Ullenhag also said that integration efforts needed to be tailored to help migrants with lower education levels. On the other side of the education scale, he argued, Sweden needed to get better at benefiting from foreign-born academics' experience and knowledge.
He further underlined that the discrepancies between men's and women's employment was noteworthy, and that integration efforts needed a clearer equality focus.

A spokesperson from the migration board in nearby Malmö, the landing point for the vast majority of refugees in Sweden, said that the board was aware of the incident.
""It is important to point out that we don't force anyone to leave fingerprints or to seek asylum in Sweden,"" he said.
""We are always trying to act humanely.""
He noted that he wasn't sure why the refugees would have acted in such a fashion, adding that it would not be the fault of the ""very well-behaved"" Swedish police force.

""We've said that as long as people have valid tickets then they're welcome to travel with us,"" a spokesperson told TT.
""This is a humanitarian catastrophe and many people on the run need to use these routes. We see ourselves as an important link in the chain."""

					07:25 CET+01:00				",TT/The Local,Bus driver's refugee attack caught on video,"UPDATED: A Swedish bus firm has apologized after one of its drivers was caught on camera when he launched an angry tirade at the group of asylum seekers he was driving across the the country.
The video, in which you can hear the driver raging at the refugees in English, was captured by one of the passengers on board the bus, which was taking the group from Malmö in southern Sweden to asylum housing in Umeå in the north.
The man was driving the final leg of the journey, a stretch of at least eight hours according to passengers.
The driver furiously explains in English where children are not allowed to sit on the bus – in the words “we are in Sweden and we have the rules” (sic) – causing several of the little ones to cry.
“Damn, that it should be so difficult to understand what we're saying,” he adds in Swedish. “Why do you come here if you don't follow our rules?”
A Syrian passenger told regional newspaper Västerbottens-kuriren, which first published the video, that the driver had told them they were not welcome in Sweden.
“It was eight horrible hours. He screamed at us whether he had a reason to or not,” he said.
The company, Bergkvarabuss, apologized after the video went viral in Sweden on Tuesday evening, and said the driver had been concerned about safety on board the bus.
“I can only apologize, it is of course highly inappropriate. It's no easy task for the driver either. They are exposed to a lot of stress and pressure, but they must not lose their temper,” Göran Mellström, chief executive of Bergkvarabuss, told the TT newswire.
The video emerges as Sweden's Migration Agency is receiving increasing criticism for not providing enough information while helping asylum seekers find temporary accommodation in the Nordic country.
After a group of refugees stayed on a bus in rural parts of central Sweden for days, refusing to get off because they were ""scared of the forest"", a spokeswoman for the agency admitted to The Local that its officers had perhaps not been clear about where they were headed after they boarded the bus in Stockholm.
Sweden, with a population of 9.8 million, expects to receive up to 190,000 asylum applications this year – putting it among the EU states with the highest proportion of refugees per capita."

The thief, a 19-year-old friend of the family, confessed to the theft soon after, wrote the Aftonbladet newspaper.
It is alleged that he sold the majority of the jewels for 9,000 kronor to two marijuana dealers.
He also reportedly threw a tiara worth 350,000 kronor off a Stockholm bridge into the water below.
The jewellery belonged to Princess Christina, the 68-year-old youngest sister of Sweden's King Carl XVI Gustaf.
The collection contained treasures inherited from her mother, Princess Sibylla, and Gustav VI Adolf, the previous king of Sweden.
It is alleged that the contents also included golden rings and bracelets, as well as gifts from the ex-emperor of Ethiopia - Haile Selassie.
The discovery of the missing treasure was made by Tord Magnuson, the husband of the princess.
When Magnuson confronted the teenager, the 19-year-old confessed to the crime immediately, wrote the paper.
The 19-year-old also told how he stole the 350,000 kronor tiara back in mid-May during a party at the palace, and then threw it into the water off the Riksbron Bridge in Stockholm.
Divers on Wednesday searched for the sunken jewels to no avail, with Aftonbladet reporting that only wallets, false teeth and one eel have been found so far.
The 19-year-old, who came to Sweden as a refugee in 2010, had lived with the royal couple, and Magnuson had acted as his mentor.
The two became close friends, with Princess Christina even referring to the man as “the child of the house”.
It is alleged that he stole the key to the safe back in April and planned to blame the housecleaner for the thefts.
Charges of aggravated theft have been filed against the man.
The 19-year-old has given descriptions to police of the two men who bought the jewels, but neither has been identified as yet.

					11:37 CEST+02:00				", The Local,'Today's refugees could be tomorrow's Zlatan',"Sweden is grappling with how to handle a large influx of asylum seekers while some other EU nations brush off responsibility – but it's important to focus on the benefits of immigration as well, high-profile panelists agreed at an Almedalen event.
Just in 2014, the number of conflicts in the world rose by 18 percent. The number of displaced people is higher than it has been since World War II. More than 60 million people have become refugees or internally displaced.
How can the EU handle the increased migration caused by conflict?
It's a question on the lips of voters, politicians, and non-profit organisations alike, yet answers remain evasive.
The EU Commission in Sweden put the spotlight on the migration crisis at Almedalen this week, with Migration Minister Morgan Johansson onstage at Europahuset's tent.
The minister pointed out that it's critical to maintain perspective.
“Only 600,000 refugees have come to the EU. It may sound like a lot, but how many people live in the EU? Something like 500 million. That's like one refugee per year being granted asylum to an island of 1,000 people.”
Johansson said that the so-called migration crisis is not an issue of numbers, but rather of shared responsibility.
Read The Local's coverage of the Almedalen event
“All EU countries need to share responsibility. Certain countries offer asylum to 3,000 people in two years, while Sweden accepts 3,000 refugees in two weeks.”
EU Member of Parliament Cecilia Wikström also participated, along with Director of the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA) Charlotte Petri Gornitzka and Katarina Areskoug Mascarenhas, head of the European Commission in Sweden.
Wikström agreed with Morgan Johansson's assessment of the situation.
“Last year Sweden took in as many refugees as Germany, did – tens of thousands. But Estonia only granted asylum to ten people,” she informed the audience.
While the EU is a strong union in some regards, Wikström said that the lack of cooperation when it comes to granting asylum is proof that the region is not as unified as it may seem.
“We must see European solidarity as something that actually means something,” she explained.
“We talk about burden sharing, but people are not burdens, they are people.”
""We have succeeded in building a monetary union in the EU, but not a humanitarian union,"" says @CeciliaWikstrom #EUiAlmedalen #AlmedalenENG
— Solveig Rundquist (@RundquistS) July 2, 2015
Of the Syrian refugees who have made the journey to the EU, one of three has higher education, Wikström said. It's an asset which EU countries sometimes ignore – a huge mistake.
“Today there are four working citizens for every pensioner, but in just a few years it will be only two-to-one,” she said. ”We need an influx of people. If Sweden takes in as many refugees as we can handle right now, we will be more prepared for the future.”
The Migration Minister agreed, noting that it's critical to include the benefits of migration in any discourse on the issue, rather than focusing solely on the challenges.
“The Västra Götaland region of Sweden was recently in need of 100 doctors,” he said.
“And when they turned to the refugee population, they discovered they had 31 Syrian doctors already living there.”
Rather than needing to wait for Swedes to finish costly and lengthy education procedures, the region offered courses in Swedish medicine terminology for the doctors, who were quickly able to gain Swedish practitioner licenses and begin working.
”We are all so proud of Zlatan, and we have to remember that those who come here now may give us the Zlatan and Loreen of 2030,” Johansson remarked.
""The refugees who come to #Sweden now could be the #Zlatan and #Loreen of 2030,"" says @johanssonmorgan #EUiAlmedalen #AlmedalenENG #svpol
— Solveig Rundquist (@RundquistS) July 2, 2015
In addition to sharing the responsibility for refugees, EU nations must work on making it easier to legally reach the EU and work there, the panellists agreed.
For one, smugglers must be stopped from taking advantage of desperate people, Wikström said.
”People pay thousands of dollars to risk their lives on an illegal boat,” she said. ”We cannot take away the business model of the smugglers without offering a legal alternative for these people.”
Johansson said that the Swedish government also supports creating additional legal ways of entering the country – although each city within Sweden must also share responsibility, and the housing market needs to catch up.
”It's also very important that those who are able to come to Sweden on work permits, for example, have good working conditions,” he said. ”They should get what they are promised, not have to negotiate for 30 kronor an hour when they actually get here.”
While there is still much work to be done before the EU has a functioning system for sharing refugee responsibility, the pros are just as important as the cons, the panel concluded.
”The refugees who come here today may be our future doctors, political scientists, and singers,” Johansson said. ""We need to keep that perspective.""

					09:56 CET+01:00				", The Local,'Aversion anxiety' halting Swedish refugee debates,"Swedes are so obsessed with appearing ""decent"" and pro-immigration, that they're too afraid to discuss the complexities of the refugee crisis, argues a Norwegian critic living in Sweden who's causing a stir for his comments.
Norwegian writer Karl Ove Knausgård has been increasingly vocal about what he sees as the refusal of the educated middle classes in his adopted home of Sweden to face up to the realities of immigration.
“In Sweden, my impression is that the desire to be decent, which is in itself laudable, has given people an aversion anxiety against discussing many problems concerning integration and immigration,” he told Norwegian newspaper Aftenposten during a book tour.
“If you talk about the issues, it means you are somehow automatically critical of immigration.”
By contrast, he described the anti-immigrant Progress Party in Norway as a “blessing” for politics, arguing that societies must “dare to talk about the problematic aspects of immigration”.
“I do not agree with their views, but it is good that they are able to express them openly without being demonised,” he said.
Knausgård is a household name in Norway, best known for his 3,500 page novel My Struggle which was a sensation in Scandinavia when its six volumes were published between 2009 and 2011.
He moved to Sweden more than a decade ago to live with his partner the Swedish poet Linda Boström and has penned numerous articles challenging the policies of his adopted nation.
In May he slammed Prime Minister Stefan Löfven for describing Sweden's anti-immigration party - the Sweden Democrats - as a “neo-fascist party”.
“Everyone knows it isn't true, but that doesn't matter because if they think differently on such a sensitive question, they must be fascists,” he argued.
Knausgård said in his latest rant that the consequences of immigration depended on how much effort society was prepared to expend on the process.
“We know nothing about the consequences of immigration, but they are clearly entirely dependent on the resources used,” he said.
“The worst thing that can happen is ghettos, closed cultures developing inside the culture.”
He arged that in Stockholm at least, this had already happened.
“Stockholm is a divided city. The white middle and upper classes congregate in the urban areas, while the immigrants and working classes live in the suburbs,” he said.
“That same white middle class is in favour of immigration, but they have no immigrants whatsoever close to them in their personal lives, and they become furious if anyone expresses right-wing populist views.”
But the critic's controversial comments have received mixed responses.
Swedish writer Jan Guillou, speaking on Norway's state broadcaster NRK on Thursday night, dismissed Knausgård's attack on Sweden, saying he was a victim of the right-wing's “delusion” that immigration could not be discussed in the country.
“Knausgård is probably one of the worst political analysts in Scandinavia,” he told NRK.
“God! Open debate? Over the last ten years this has been one of the main topics for discussion in Sweden. It surprises me that a man like Knausgård, who has lived in Sweden, is also a victim of this delusion.”
Up to 190,000 people are expected to seek asylum in Sweden in 2015, as the Nordic nation continues to take in more refugees per capita than most other EU member states.
The nationalist Sweden Democrat party gained 12.9 percent in the country's last general election and has recently been scoring around 20 percent in opinion polls. However a survey released last month suggested that most Swedes support their country's approach to immigration and are in favour of rising numbers of refugees."

Five people, an adult and a minor, were stopped by police after they were found walking on the motorway towards the Öresund tunnel and bridge connecting Copenhagen to Malmö in Sweden on Sunday evening – the second similar incident in less than a week.
""Because it was on the Danish side we called our Danish colleagues. They took a few people into custody,"" police spokesperson Ewa-Gun Westford told Swedish public broadcaster SVT.
Danish police confirmed to TV2 that all five, an adult and four minors, had previously sought asylum in Denmark.
""We went out and got them, and they were taken back to the refugee camp where they are staying,"" said police control room officer Carsten Reenberg.
The controversy came just hours after police arrested a man allegedly trying to smuggle a migrant into the country aboard a rubber dinghy from the Danish town of Helsingör to Helsingborg.
Refugee support groups have expressed fears of human trafficking and dangerous clandestine crossings across the Baltic as a result of Sweden's ID checks.
And Westford said she would not be surprised if more people attempted to avoid the controls either by boat or by attempting to cross the Öresund bridge on foot.
""This could be the first sign of something new. We know that asylum seekers are trying to walk through the tunnel crossing the English channel,"" said Westford.
""We know from other occasions when there are new rules that it's first quiet for a couple of days and then people try to find new ways around the obstacles,"" she said.

Meanwhile, Sweden's infrastructure minister Anna Johansson visited the region on Monday to meet with Danish counterparts, who have voiced concern over the checks in the integrated Öresund region. More than 8,000 commuters from Sweden and Denmark travel daily by train across the bridge.
""Of course we're listening to Danish views and will see if it is possible to solve the issues that are causing the most problems. But we have a strong interest in bringing down the number of people seeking asylum in Sweden,"" the minister told reporters after a meeting in Copenhagen.
READ ALSO: What do commuters think of ID checks?
A country of 9.8 million people, Sweden took in 163,000 asylum seekers last year, more per capita than any other EU nation.
Unable to cope with the unregulated flow of arrivals, it has since January 4 required all travellers to show photo identification when entering from Denmark, the main entry point for migrants into Sweden.
The number of asylum seekers has dropped sharply since then. On January 8, the migration agency said the number of asylum applications received in the first week of January had fallen below 1,500, after receiving almost 10,000 a week for much of October and November."

Athanassia Fourla
Yes, that's me: one of the many victims of the Swedish conspiracy of sending cute Swedes around the globe to fool foreign men and women to fall in love with them and move here.
I had thought before about moving to another country but not for love and not to Sweden. However, life works in mysterious ways, so here I am. To me it is impossible to compare a relationship here with a relationship back home since it is all about people and everyone is unique.
Maybe I could talk about some more specific things about relationships here, always at the risk of generalising when I shouldn't. Let's take for instance the fact that couples here do not really share: there is ""mine"" and ""yours"" a lot more than in other countries.
On the plus side, people in relationships are much freer here to have lives of their own. Then there is all this very amusing relationship-defining terminology like ""sambo"" [literally: co-habitant], ""särbo"" [couples living apart] etc. which makes no sense at all in other cultures.
But again one can never compare relationships with each other, not even in the same country. Of course the cultural differences give a different spice to it but still we are talking about men and women and the basic trends are universal – for better or for worse.
Graeme Newcomb
Yes, I am a ""love refugee"", although my sambo was willing to compromise for the first six years of our relationship and we both ended up settling on the UK as a suitable ""middle ground"" before moving to Sweden.
I think that the biggest difference between Swedish women and their South African counterparts is that Swedish women are a lot more independent and self-confident. In contrast, many English-speaking South African women seem quite happy to revel in old fashioned gender stereotypes.
I also find that Swedish women seem to be significantly less focussed on shallow materialistic issues than English-speaking South African women, who largely seem to be inordinately obsessed about living in the ""right"" suburb, ensuring that their kids go to the ""right school"" and how much money their partner makes.
Emma Chataway
Along with many other people, it seems I too am indeed a love refugee. Which sounds a lot nicer than an immigrant for some reason. At the beginning anyway, a big difference between a relationship here and a relationship back home back home was being faced with all the unfamiliar, lost and disorientated feelings that hit you like a brick on arrival.
It isn't so much the relationship that changes, but how as a couple you are able to cope with it all. When I feel like I'm not getting anywhere here, my Swede is quick to reassure me that, if I don't like it, we can simply go back to Australia. This is nice to hear; it's good to know that if this doesn't work out, it doesn't mean that we don't either. However, I'm stubborn and determined to build something up here. Nonetheless, it does take the pressure off.
It's wonderful and scary to take this step for someone you love. To move to another country and try to set up a life together. It also feels nice to have a good moan about his country too, the way he did in mine. I finally get to say, ""Well in Australia...""
It's also an intriguing journey to inhabit your loved one's environment. To see firsthand why they are who they are, through learning their language (or trying to anyway), traditions, finally meeting their parents, friends and seeing embarrassing photos of them when they were young.
It gives you this bigger perspective of them, like stepping back and seeing the whole picture. I've had many, ""Ahh...so that's why"" moments, especially over the dinner table, like grappling with the passion my man has for cream sauce, potatoes and herring. Overall though, just being exposed, reflecting and discussing our small and large cultural differences is refreshing I think for any sort of relationship.
Igor Trisic
I have never been even close to becoming that, so I don't have much experience on that matter. However, since I come from outside the EU, the situation for me is different than for some other folks on this panel.
The first thing that comes to mind is the issue of asymmetry and dependence on the partner. If a relationship breaks down you are forced to come back to your old country, and naturally anyone who moves to Sweden is likely to sell their house or apartment in order to contribute to the joint pot.
The other thing that put me off is that the Migration Boards has to learn all sorts of details about the relationship before you get the green light. Not to mention the fact that it can take up to six months before you can even come to Sweden.
If I ever entered in this kind relationship I would have to be certain that it will work and that's hard. I would prefer to move to Sweden, establish myself there and meet someone then.
Thomas Smith
I am not quite sure that I am a ""love refugee"" but I did move to Sweden because the woman I love lives here. Being in a relationship here is different only if you want it to be.
Language, people, traditions and having new friends are some things that may be different, but in the end, isn't it the same no matter where you are? It's all about being home and being with the one you love. I am home and I am with the one I love.
Swedish panelists: Are you harbouring a love refugee?
Daniel Nyström
I'm happy living in Sweden with my wife, but if she were to move to another country I would most definitely follow and try to make a new life for us there. I know she would do the same for me.
It would be pretty hard leaving the things that you have worked for and accomplished, but human values are more important and I probably wouldn't even hesitate.
Katarina Johnsson
I assume I fit in the category of harbouring a love refugee. One of the more obvious quirks is the different areas of interest when it comes to sport. I have grown to appreciate rugby over the years, but I still struggle with the notion of watching a cricket game for five days.
Another quirk would be the different views on weather. During the winter I get to witness my partner's fascination and joy with snow, ice and freezing cold temperatures. This is great as I mostly find the winter an inconvenient period just to get through.
On the other hand, in the summer, when my spirit returns, I have to fight his reluctance to spend all our time outside and watch him avoiding the sun by any means possible."

					14:53 CEST+02:00				", The Local,Swedish pediatrician: Some 'children' nearly 40,"A Swedish pediatrician is sparking debate after saying some refugees claiming to be unaccompanied minors are lying about their age. He even deems some of them to be as old as 40.
“There are only a few cases of course, but they have definitely been between 30 and 40 years old,” Pediatrician Josef Milerad was quoted by Swedish tabloid Expressen as saying.
Some 31,000 asylum-seeking refugees are currently registered with the Swedish Migration Agency as unaccompanied minors. But according to Milerad, that number is likely larger than it should be, as he alleges some of those people claim to be much younger than they actually are in order to be granted asylum more easily.
According to Milerad, the tests carried out by Swedish authorities to verify the real age of a child are naïve and insufficient, and he advocates for the tests to be done medically, including through x-rays.
“The refugee children who are in their early and mid-teens are the ones who end up paying the price for this [lying]. These are resources that have been earmarked for children, but it’s used for another age group,” he told the newspaper.
Milerad said that he has examined several people that the migration agency has classed as children, but that according to his own professional opinion almost 40 percent of them are in fact between 20 and 25 years old, and some of them even near their forties.
“I think that my professional opinion, even if I can’t support it with evidence, would turn out to be quite accurate – there is a difference between a 16-year-old and a 20-year-old,” he said."

The refugees were discovered in a rubber boat in Skillinge harbour in Skåne, according to a classified intelligence report first seen by Swedish broadsheet Dagens Nyheter (DN).
They are understood to be the first group to be caught attempting to bypass newly toughened border controls by sailing to Sweden in this kind of boat.
According to DN, the secret document about their efforts was recently handed to Sweden's Ministry of Justice by Sweden's Department of National Operations (Noa).
""It is too early to comment if the individual case of a rubber dinghy that arrived in Skillinge harbour is human trafficking,"" DN reported the file as stating.
Linda Staaf, an intelligence chief at Noa confirmed to the newspaper that it had ""received the information"" about the refugees' efforts.
""We've double-checked it, and we stand by it. But I can not go into how we got the information or from whom - whether from the police or the Migration Agency,"" she said.
But a local fishermen Tommy Persson later told Swedish broadcaster SVT that he had seen the boat entering the harbour on Monday 23rd November.
""I met the rubber boat that was coming into the harbour when I was on the way out. I first thought they had been fishing for cod but that is unusual at this time of year,"" he added.
The witness also speculated that he thought the boat was too small to have crossed the Baltic sea and had most likely been released from a larger vessel.
The Swedish Coastguard was quick to react to the claims, with press spokesperson Mattias Lindholm telling SVT that ""if the information is correct this must be a singular case,"" explaining that staff had not seen any other groups attempting to reach Sweden in small boats.
DN said in its news story that the intelligence report warns that new border controls in Sweden are making it more common for refugees to hide in various forms of transport in order to try and reach the Nordic country.
Sweden stepped up its immigration checks last month after announcing that it could no longer guarantee accommodation to all refugees arriving in the Nordic nation. Since then, the number of new migrant arrivals has dropped by a third, according to Sweden's migration agency.
More than 80,000 people have applied for asylum in Sweden in the past two months alone, which would be the equivalent of 25 million asylum seekers for the entire EU, Swedish Prime Minister Stefan Löfven said last week. The leader made the comments after announcing that Sweden would drastically tighten its asylum rules, no longer guaranteeing permanent residency to successful applicants."

Morgan Johansson was leaving the building when a man grabbed a fire extinguisher and sprayed foam over the minister, according to reports in regional newspaper Kristianstadsbladet.
According to the paper, the Social Democrat politician barely had time to react before a guard from Sweden's Security Service (Säpo) pulled the man to the ground.
The minister had spent the day visiting various locations around Kristianstad, a city in Skåne in southern Sweden.
The refugee accommodation he was attacked at is on the former site of Broby Hospital, a healthcare centre which closed down several years ago.
Earlier on Monday the Swedish Migration Board announced it was tripling the maximum number of residents allowed at asylum centres from 200 to 650, to cope with rising demand.
Sweden became the first European country in 2013 to grant automatic residency to Syrian refugees and has since seen asylum requests rise to record levels, which are still expected to reach about 90,000 in 2015.
Previously no more than 200 asylum seekers were permitted to stay in one centre. But under the new rules, the Migration Board can sign a basic contract for 350 places, including two supplementary agreements of 150 places each after the first ones have been filled.
According to the Swedish Migration Board's latest prognosis, 15,000 more asylum places will need to be created in the coming year.
Last week a survey by pollsters Ipsos commissioned by Swedish newspaper Dagens Nyheter suggested that more than 60 percent of Swedes believe that immigration is good for the country, but just ten percent agree that integration efforts are working well.
Morgan Johansson told local news network P4 Kristianstad that he had been ""taken by surprise"", but added that he had not been injured.
""But you shouldn't treat these things too lightly either. You can't just say 'move on', because of course it's serious,"" he said.
The attack on the politician took place as Sweden's Prime Minister Stefan Löfven reiterated his commitment to helping refugees, but called on other EU nations to share the burden.
""We need to provide security for the refugees who risk facing death just a few mile off the coast of Europe, and get more of the EU member states to take responsibility for refugee protection,"" he said in a speech at a school in Gothenburg.
""Germany and Sweden take the greatest responsibility. More countries need to help take care of refugees,"" he added."

					16:38 CEST+02:00				", The Local,History dies deep in the woods: The forgotten Nazi concentration camp survivors in the forests of Småland,"History writer Victoria Martínez investigates an almost forgotten part of Sweden's past, the story of the 1,000 Polish survivors of Nazi concentration camps who ended up in a refugee camp deep in the woods of Småland county.
History has a way of being forgotten, whether by accident or design, especially when it's painful. Histories with straightforward and happy endings make us feel good about ourselves and more hopeful about the outcome of our own uncertain times. Those that lack resolution or defy the need for an optimistic conclusion frequently exist in varying degrees of figurative darkness – ignored, neglected, forsaken. Sometimes, the darkness is also literal – a place so tucked away from view that the eyes of the collective consciousness barely need to look away to forget.
Just such a place exists in Öreryd, Sweden, where a World War II refugee camp once stood. There, deep in the forests of Småland, the painful yet vitally-important history of 1,000 survivors of Nazi concentration camps has been left to die in the woods.

In and out of memory
On May 8th 1945, the previous occupants of the Öreryd refugee camp – the last of some 40,000 Norwegians who had transited through the small village since 1941 – celebrated VE Day by marching off to the train station in nearby Hestra with much fanfare. They were returning to their homeland, only just liberated from Nazi occupation. They left behind an almost uniformly pleasant legacy that is noted in local tourist information.
The mainly Polish survivors of Nazi concentration camps who began to stream into Öreryd just weeks later in June 1945 are not mentioned alongside the Norwegians in the tourist material; not even the two buried in the cemetery behind the 18th century church. There was no celebratory parade to see off the last of them before the camp closed for good in autumn 1946. Their legacy is – like their time there had been – more complex and painful than that of the Norwegians. It is also a legacy that is far more fragmented, obscure, and poorly documented.
In the collective consciousness of Sweden and the rest of the world, the history of these Polish refugees usually begins and ends with their safe arrival to Sweden in the spring and summer of 1945. That story is better-known, not least because it involved the largest rescue operation to take place within Nazi Germany during World War II: the Swedish Red Cross's “White Buses” operation, which had been negotiated between the organization's vice-president, Count Folke Bernadotte – a member of Sweden's royal family – and Nazi Reich leader Heinrich Himmler.
Conducted in March and April 1945, this heroic operation involved multiple round-trip journeys within Nazi Germany between two active front lines and into working concentration camps, from which some 21,000 prisoners of many nationalities were liberated and brought to safety in Sweden. That summer, a further 10,000 survivors were given refuge in Sweden at the request of the United Nations Refugee and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA).
Of the 31,000 people liberated through these efforts, approximately 40 percent were Polish and one-third or more were Jewish. According to Lars Olsson, Professor Emeritus in History at Linnaeus University, 43 percent of the approximately 10,000 Jewish survivors were Polish. The roughly 1,000 Jewish and non-Jewish Poles who made their way to the Öreryd refugee camp in 1945 were part of this group of survivors.
All came to Sweden broken to some degree, physically and psychologically. Swedish media reports on the arrival of the survivors to Malmö were filled with descriptions of their shocking appearance. Skeletal, filthy, tattooed with serial numbers, dressed in rags and prison clothes marked with various designations. In short, they had been “degraded to animals,” as a journalist wrote in Expressen in June 1945. Around 90 percent of the UNRRA refugees had tuberculosis. All were quarantined for at least two weeks, and many were hospitalized for extended periods. Quite a few didn't long survive their rescue, as evidenced by cemeteries like Norra kyrkogården in Lund.
Although most of the survivors didn't die in places like Malmö and Lund, their stories become obscure and frequently disappear after their departure for one of the 150 refugee camps located mainly in southern Sweden, including Öreryd. Then, as now, this lapse is a disservice not only to the survivors, but also to Swedish society and posterity. As prominent Swedish journalist Göran Rosenberg wrote about Holocaust survivors such as his father: “It's impossible to think you've all survived in order for the world to forget what it's just been through and to go on as if nothing has happened.”

The Curtain of Silence
The story of David Rosenberg – a Jewish survivor of the Łódź ghetto, Braunschweig slave labour camp, and Auschwitz-Birkenau and Ravensbrück concentration camps – as told in A Brief Stop on the Road from Auschwitz, is undoubtedly the most high-profile account of a Polish concentration camp survivor who was at the Öreryd refugee camp. Originally published in Swedish in 2012 as Ett kort uppehåll på vägen från Auschwitz, Göran Rosenberg's book has since been translated into ten languages. In addition to grappling with what he calls the “curtain of silence… between the world the visitors bring with them and the world that surrounds them”, both then and now, Rosenberg provides personal insight into the issues and challenges the concentration camp survivors faced in Öreryd.
Like David Rosenberg, who had arrived in Malmö ill with typhus and weighing only 36 kilos, the Polish refugees who came to Öreryd freshly released from quarantine or hospital were nonetheless nowhere near “recovered” from their ordeals. On the contrary, they were just beginning a physical, emotional and psychological journey away from the atrocities inflicted on them, their families, and their homeland. In this sense, the title of Rosenberg's book is particularly apt. Öreryd, like all Swedish refugee camps, was a brief stop on the refugees' journeys from Nazi concentration camps to a new life they had to somehow piece together.
Arriving at this stop, they would have found that the camp was a well-oiled machine after four years in service. Built beginning in May 1940, almost immediately following the German invasions of Denmark and Norway, it was originally intended as a work camp for ambiguously-described “icke behagliga personer,” which translates approximately to “uncomfortable people”. For neutral Sweden, awkwardly located between Nazi Germany and Communist Russia and their respective occupied territories, this broad terminology allowed for the internment of anyone who could not be trusted by Swedish authorities in the event the country became directly involved in the war.
It was never used for this original purpose, and it remained empty until March 1941 when it began receiving Norwegians fleeing their country's Nazi occupation, most of whom stayed only for short periods. During 1944 and 1945, it also served as a military camp for the training of Norwegian reserve police, which was effectively part of the Norwegian resistance.

The location of the camp was strategic. With a population of 316 in 1940, Öreryd was located out of the way in the dense forests of Småland, where tight controls and secrecy could be maintained. Just 55 kilometres south-west of Jönköping, with access to the Nissastigen road (now a part of Highway 26) that links Jönköping and Halmstad, and the train station in Hestra – a stop on the Borås-Alvesta Railway line – the location also offered good communication with and transportation to other parts of Sweden.
Although the camp and the locals were the same as when the Norwegians were there, the experiences of the Polish refugees were entirely different. Whereas similar culture and language had meant the Norwegians and Swedes were able to socialize and communicate easily, the Polish refugees and the Öreryd locals faced major cultural and communication barriers. More crucially, the gravity of the Polish refugees' experiences would have been almost unfathomable to everyone, making reaching out to seek or provide help much more difficult. These factors, along with sparse historical records, have undoubtedly played a role in keeping the Polish refugees' stories so fragmented and obscure. A key example is the story of the two graves in the Öreryd church cemetery that have been a virtual mystery since the internments in 1945 and 1946.
In spring 1972, the late Swedish journalist and author Jan Olof Olsson – known as Jolo – happened upon the graves, marked only with the names Mgr Antoni Wierzbowski and Ignacy Hundzel. He wrote about his discovery in Dagens Nyheter in April, pondering how two Polish Catholics came to be buried in a tiny Swedish Protestant cemetery. A short response from former Öreryd church officials was published six days later. It was probably the first time in decades that a mention of Polish concentration camp survivors in Öreryd appeared in print. This brief public exchange shed a bit of light on the subject, but mainly highlighted how little was known about the Polish refugees, even by people who had been in Öreryd at the time.
All parties to this exchange agreed that the “Mgr” designation meant that Antoni Wierzbowski had been a Catholic monsignor. In fact, it is an abbreviation of the Polish academic degree of Magister, which is equivalent to a Master's degree. As a Pole with a high level of education, Magister Wierzbowski had probably been a target of the Nazi's systematic elimination of Polish intellectuals and elites that began in 1939. In two genocidal operations, the Intelligenzaktion in 1939 and the AB-Aktion in 1940, approximately 68,000 members of Poland's intelligentsia were executed by the Nazis, and many more were imprisoned in concentration camps. As a survivor, Magister Wierzbowski would have been justifiably proud of his academic title, as would his fellow Poles who buried him in the Öreryd church cemetery on March 21st 1946, following his death by a probable heart attack.

The wildflower bouquets were offered by the author´s children. Photo: Victoria Martínez
This 70-year-old misunderstanding of three letters with great meaning is part of the legacy of “the curtain” referred to by Göran Rosenberg. Karl Gustav Rinder, who was a minister in Öreryd until 1946, also mentioned it in his part of the response to Jolo. He wrote that although a Catholic priest from Gothenburg had initially been at the camp, “A little later, a priest came from Poland and then the curtain was pulled down… They isolated themselves completely from us and handled all the ceremonies themselves. I remember that tragic deaths occurred in the camp, but I think that they were never reported, there is probably nothing in our church books.”
Of the occupant of the second grave, Ignacy Hundzel, little is known except that his death in 1945 was apparently a suicide. Despite the presence of health professionals and mental health counselors at the refugee camp, suicides were not uncommon.
“Suicides were not a surprise. We were only surprised there weren't more of them,” said Inga Ericsson, 82, whose parents, Gustav and Elsa Fält, were prominent citizens in Öreryd.

The experiences and descriptions of survivors like 16-year-old Anna Krasińska, who had been in a slave labour camp in Neustrelitz, Germany, from 1940 to 1945, help make it possible for those of us detached from this terrible period of history to comprehend what Inga meant. Interviewed in 1946 during her time in Öreryd as part of an initiative by The Polish Research Institute in Lund, Anna recounted experiences at Neustrelitz like discovering fingers and ears in her soup. The interviewer's tragic summary of Anna reads in part: “She gives [the] impression that underneath [the] guise of getting tame with people and with the present surrounding, she is stacked in tragedy of a lonely and wronged child who passed through [the] bottom of evil and [the] bottom of physical and moral misery.”
In researching the Öreryd refugee camp, there is certainly the impression that normalcy was a pretense clung to by both survivors and locals. However, for the survivors, there is also the sense that it was a byproduct of the routine activities necessary to rebuild a life. On the one hand, the desire to look ahead may have been driven by a fear of looking back at the Nazi atrocities. On the other hand, the tasks necessary for reconstruction gave the impression that the survivors were moving forward in a natural manner.
For many of the Öreryd refugees, this would have included determining if loved ones had survived and, if so, where they were and how to contact them. Inga Ericsson recalls how on her daily walk to school, she helped a Polish refugee call his wife, who was 100 kilometers away in a refugee camp in Solberga. The details of that routine – including the woman's name and the telephone number – are etched in Inga's memory to this day because they were, in fact, anything but routine. This type of daily quest or activity would have given the refugees a purpose and direction that could have made it appear as though the terrors of the concentration camps were dissolving neatly into the past.
In reality, the survivors were coping not only with the past, but also dealing with the challenges of daily life in the refugee camp. Jewish survivors, for instance, were often confronted with anti-Semitism from their non-Jewish countrymen within the camp. Students at the Polish gymnasium established in Öreryd completed two years of study in one year and took their exams without the benefit of books. And although some refugees found temporary work in factories, forests and fields, these situations presented challenges of their own and did not usually offer a path to a more permanent future in Sweden or anywhere else.
On 14 September 1946, the story of the Öreryd refugee camp was neatly concluded when Jönköpings-Posten reported that 13 students of the Polish high school celebrated the completion of their exams. Two of the students, including 21-year-old Auschwitz survivor Vanda Nekvasz, spoke about their futures with uncertainty. Both told the newspaper that they wanted to study or work in Sweden, but also wished they could return to Poland. Even with the sense of mildly-festive optimism that permeated the article, neither option seemed very likely to occur. And with that, the stories of the Polish refugees in Öreryd drifted into obscurity.

Looking Back to See Ahead
In 1977, a stone monument was raised along Öreryd's main road. The original plaque reads simply, “Öreryds flyktingläger 1940-1946” (Öreryd refugee camp). Another plaque, added to the stone in 1980, is a token of gratitude from the Norwegians who once found refuge there. On certain days of the year, three flags are raised behind the monument: the Swedish, the Norwegian, and the Polish. Few will see this sight and even fewer know it exists. Almost no one would know what the Polish flag signifies.
As World War II and the Holocaust pass out of living memory, the history of the survivors of Nazi concentration camps in Swedish refugee camps like Öreryd is in danger of being lost entirely, even as it has profound relevance to our own time. With the United Nations calling the ongoing conflict in Syria “the biggest humanitarian and refugee crisis of our time”, and Sweden again taking in large numbers of refugees, it's more important than ever to look back to discover what a painful history like this can teach us about our individual and collective responses to such events.
History only dies deep in the woods if we allow it to waste away in darkness.

					08:07 CEST+02:00				", The Local,Man with alleged Nazi links admits driving his car into a refugee demonstration in Malmö,"A 22-year-old man with suspected neo-Nazi links has confessed to driving his Volvo into an Iraqi demonstration outside the Migration Agency in Malmö. Police are investigating it as hate crime.
The man has admitted driving his car into a demonstration of around 20-30 Iraqi nationals protesting Sweden's new and stricter asylum rules outside the Migration Agency in Malmö on two occasions.
No one was injured but in the latest incident at around 10.30pm on Sunday he drove over a number of protest signs and crashed into a tree. The man then barricaded himself in the car to protect himself against the agitated protesters, who kept him there until police arrived and seized him.
The 22-year-old has also admitted driving at the demonstration on Saturday.
Police said they are investigating hate crime. The man, who Aftonbladet reports has a history of neo-Nazi activity, including participating in demonstrations and study groups organized by neo-Nazi group the Nordic Resistance Movement, has been released from custody during the ongoing police investigation.
“He said he's doing it to make a point. That he does not think they should be in the country,” Sandra Persson, from the police's special hate crime investigation unit, told the Swedish newspaper.
“We are prioritizing this. It is a clear hate crime with many people affected. And it happened at this site, outside the Migration Agency,” she said.
The 22-year-old is suspected of agitation against an ethnic group, illegally carrying a weapon, illegally carrying a knife and assault. One of the allegations includes using pepper spray on a number of protesters. It is against the law to carry pepper spray without a licence in Sweden. Two knives were also found in his car, as well as a Nazi symbol with a swastika, reported broadcaster SVT.
The incident has been falsely reported by some international extremist groups on social media as an Islamist attack, with Facebook group 'Never Again Canada' – an anti-Islam group which claims to fight “anti-Semitism, propaganda, terror and Jew hatred in Canada” and has almost 200,000 followers on Facebook – incorrectly describing the suspect as a “Muslim terrorist” on Monday."

					10:40 CEST+02:00				",TT/The Local,Swedish parties reveal temporary asylum plan,"UPDATED: The Swedish government and four opposition parties have agreed to introduce temporary residence permits for a number of refugees arriving in the Nordic country.
Sweden's ruling Social Democrat-Green coalition and the four parties in the centre-right Alliance opposition (the Moderates, the Centre Party, the Liberals and the Christian Democrats) presented the new agreement on refugee immigration and integration at a press conference on Friday morning.
""We have got further than many thought we would. Perhaps even a bit further than we ourselves thought,"" Justice and Migration Minister Morgan Johansson of the Social Democrats told reporters.
The parties agreed to introduce temporary residence permits rather than permanent ones, an idea mainly pushed for by Anna Kinberg Batra's Moderate Party, in the coming three years. Families with children and unaccompanied minors arriving in the country will be excepted from the hotly debated proposal.
The politicians also agreed to make it mandatory for all local authorities to take in a share of refugees. A 10 billion kronor grant is to be shared between Sweden's councils in 2015 to help them cope with the influx.
The announcement came as Germany said it planned to introduce tougher asylum laws by Saturday. Both countries have been fighting for a fairer distribution of asylum seekers across the EU in recent weeks.
Sweden's parties agreed on Friday to raise the number of migrants the country accepts under EU quotas to 5,000 (from 1,900) and to look at ways of finding more legal ways for refugees to seek asylum in member states. Efforts will also be boosted to ensure people who have had their applications rejected leave the country.
The government also announced that it would request that the EU helps relocate some of Sweden's asylum seekers to other member states, to help share the burden.
""We say that not just Greece and Italy should be part of this redistribution scheme, but Sweden as well. And I have brought this up with the commission's chairman Juncker and the council's chairman Tusk, that the situation is such that you have to count on that we will put forward a request of that kind,"" Prime Minister Stefan Löfven told the TT news agency after the press conference.
To help new arrivals integrate, the parties agreed to introduce Swedish tuition at asylum accommodation centres. The government will also increase tax deductions for work in the home (the so-called 'Rut deduction') to include IT services, home removal and gardening work, a proposal put forward by the Social Democrats' minor coalition partners, the Greens.
The Left Party, which formed part of earlier talks, was left out of the cross-party deal.
""The government has chosen to close the door to the Left Party in the negotiations. They have chosen to join the Conservative's very restrictive line,"" its representative Nooshi Dadgostar told Aftonbladet.
However the Social Democrats' representative Ylva Johansson told Friday's press conference the party had left of their own accord.
The anti-immigration Sweden Democrat party has not been part of the talks either.
Friday's agreement followed days of crisis talks between the mainstream parties as Sweden continues to take in record numbers of refugees fleeing war in Africa and the Middle East.
On Thursday the Migration Agency revealed that up to 190,000 asylum seekers are expected to arrive in the Nordic country in 2015, more than twice as many as previously predicted. Of those, 29,000 to 40,000 are expected to be children travelling alone.
Another wave of between 100,000 and 170,000 people are predicted for 2016.
""We note that the current refugee situation is unprecedented in modern times. We see pictures of people literally walking from Greece, across the Balkans and Germany and towards the Nordic countries. More people than ever are seeking asylum in Europe, but there is no border control and no exact figure,"" its director-general Anders Danielsson told reporters at a press conference in Stockholm on Thursday."

					15:04 CEST+02:00				",TT/The Local,More refugee protests at Sweden-Finland border,"Two demonstrations passed off peacefully just across the Swedish border in the Finnish town of Tornio on Saturday as 100 people marched in favour of open borders while 300 protested against more refugees being allowed into Finland.
According to Swedish newspaper Expressen the mood was often rancorous but there was no violence.
Swedish news agency TT, reported that several of the anti-refugee protesters were carrying Finnish flags and holding placards such as “Migrants not welcome"" and ""No fucking immigration”.
More than 800 people had accepted the invitation on the anti-refugee protesters' Facebook page to participate in the demonstration against the asylum seekers seeking protection. However, only 300 turned out.
An organiser for the counter demonstration told Swedish Radio's local channel in Norrbotten county that the demonstrations were peaceful and that 100 people had showed up to support the refugees.
Finland is experiencing an unexpected influx of migrants on its border with Sweden, mostly Iraqi asylum seekers hoping to reunite with friends and family.
By the end of September, more than 13,000 asylum seekers had arrived in the Nordic nation compared to just 3,600 in the whole of last year.
While Sweden takes in more asylum seekers per capita than any other EU nation and has pledged to offer a home to all Syrians fleeing conflict in their home country, Finland has been granting asylum to a higher percentage of Iraqis (45 percent during the first half of this year) compared to Sweden (33 percent).
According to Swedish Radio, some refugees make the long journey by bus and train to the Swedish-Finnish border in the north because boat trips over the Baltic would require showing identification.
In September Finland announced it would tighten control over its northern border in an effort to control the flow of refugees that come to the country by land.
The first protests at the border took place two weeks ago and, again, passed off peacefully."

					15:56 CET+01:00				",Lee Roden,Concerns for desperate refugee kids 'planning suicide online',"Concerns have been raised that refugee children in Sweden are using online forums to plan mass suicides, and are not always receiving the adequate care they need for mental illness.
Sweden's Ombudsman for Children, the government agency tasked with representing the rights of children, held an emergency meeting earlier this month with the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationsverket), National Board of Health and Welfare (Socialstyrelsen) and Health and Social Care Inspectorate (IVO).
The discussions were prompted after the alarm was raised by ""Vi står inte ut"", a network which works for the rights of lone refugee children in Sweden. They warned that refugee kids were using closed online forums to plan suicides, with some saying they knew they would die anyway if they had their asylum application rejected and were deported.
The Ombudsman for Children in Sweden's press officer Hans Reuterskiöld told The Local that they have seen worrying signs while carrying out research on the situation for refugee children in the country.
”We have met kids who showed signs of self-harm and expressed suicidal thoughts. What we see is that the uncertain situation many live under after coming to Sweden contributes to increased mental illness among newly arrived kids during the asylum process,"" he said.
At the moment it is difficult to gauge how widespread the problem may be, he added:
""We can't say how big the problem is because, among other things, there aren't any coherent statistics covering the mental health of newly arrived kids. That was one of the questions we brought up with the National Board of Health and Welfare, Migrationsverket and IVO when we had discussions with them recently.""
Sweden received a record 163,000 asylum applications in 2015, of which 35,369 were lone children. In 2016, 2199 lone refugee children sought asylum in the country, per Migrationsverket's figures.
According to the Ombudsman for Children, many of the children suffer from psychological trauma, and are not getting the care they need.
""The kids we met often describe difficult memories from fleeing and from home as the grounds for mental illness. What we have also seen is that they don't always get the care they need and have the right to, and there are big regional differences,"" Reuterskiöld noted, adding that the continuity and competence of care provided varies.
Since 2015 the Ombudsman for Children has been investigating the situation for children who have sought asylum in Sweden. It will put forward recommendations to the government based on that research on March 24th, when it releases an annual report for 2017.
""We came up with some proposals for changes, like making it clear how medical screening of newly arrived children should go, improving the information about the effects of trauma and stress, and what kind of help children and young people have the right to and can turn to,"" Reuterskiöld explained.
""We will also suggest strengthening the continuity of health care and ensuring access to trauma focused treatment.""
Last year, human rights organization Human Rights Watch criticized Sweden's treatment of unaccompanied migrant children, highlighting a lack of adequate pyscological care and long waiting periods for processing.
Sweden's health minister Gabriel Wikström last week promised to provide more support for municipalities in their work with mental illness among lone refugee children.
Wikström, along with minister for children and the elderly Åsa Regnér, held a meeting with agencies and organizations working with lone refugee children following the reports about planned suicides.
""We must make sure to create more peace and calm among unaccompanied children. One contributing factor is that they don't know how the process and the future looks, which leads to uncertainty, anxiety and mental illness,"" he told news agency TT.
As of April 2016, 16 and 17-year-olds who are not considered to have grounds for asylum in Sweden but who are also not able to be sent home immediately due to a lack of a processing system in their home country can be granted temporary residency permits before being deported when they turn 18.
Migrationsverket says that 88 percent of the asylum requests from lone refugee children processed in 2015 were granted, and 86 percent were granted in 2016."

					08:47 CEST+02:00				",TT/AFP/The Local,Finland attacks Sweden’s open refugee policy,"Sweden will end up helping traffickers and terrorists if it continues to have such open borders, Finland’s Foreign Minister Timo Soini has suggested.
The minister, who is also the founder of the nationalist True Finns party in Finland, made the claims in an interview with Finnish newspaper Ilta-Sanomat on Tuesday.
His comments come amid the biggest influx of immigrants to Finland since the Russian Revolution. Hundreds of refugees are attempting to cross into Finland from Lapland in northern Sweden.
“It is still not so dangerous, but if the situation persists, it could become serious,” said Soini.
The foreign minister added that Sweden might find itself facilitating “criminal activities such as people smuggling and the terrorist chains that finance such activities”. He also suggested that this could lead to deteriorating relations between the two Nordic neighbours.
Sweden, along with other EU countries, argues that Finland, which has a population of just 5.5 million, should increase its share of refugees.
“That may be the case. But it is unthinkable that we should do this by ignoring EU rules and transporting refugees from country to country,” said Soini.
The minister was referring to the EU’s Dublin Regulation which states that the country where an asylum seeker first enters the union is responsible for registering their application and taking fingerprints.
However Swedish newspaper Aftonbladet reported that Soini softened his comments somewhat in a later interview with Finnish broadcaster Iltalehti.
“It was not the goal to attack Sweden specifically, what he said was true for the whole of Europe,” Niina Hyrsky, a press spokesperson at the Finnish embassy in Stockholm also told the tabloid.
Sweden’s Foreign Minister Margot Wallström was unavailable for interviews on Tuesday night.
More than 11,000 refugees arrived in Finland in the first eight months of this year, a number five times fewer than in neighbouring Sweden. But Finland’s population is half the size of Sweden's and the country - which is in recession - has argued that it lacks the infrastructure Sweden has to welcome large numbers of refugees.
Observers have in recent weeks been surprised to see so many migrants travelling through Sweden to seek asylum in Finland, given Sweden's reputation as a generous welcomer of asylum seekers.
But according to statistics, a large proportion of the asylum seekers are Iraqi and stand a better chance of being granted asylum in Finland, whereas Sweden has a stronger track record of taking in Syrians.

The 25-year-old was found in a room at the centre in Mariannelund in southeastern Sweden, five months after a young asylum-seeker allegedly stabbed to death a refugee centre worker in southwestern Molndal.
""The circumstances and the evidence found at the site raise suspicions that she was murdered,"" police said in a statement, without indicating whether the victim was an asylum-seeker or employee.
However, sources told Aftonbladet newspaper that they did not think it was someone who worked at the centre.
One person had been detained and other potential witnesses were being questioned.
The trial of the asylum-seeker charged with the Molndal killing began earlier this month.
He had claimed to be 15 but was later found to have lied.
The court hearing the case is waiting for submissions from a team of psychiatrists before it issues a ruling, as the suspected killer claims to have heard ""voices"" encouraging him to commit suicide.
Sweden earlier this week toughened its rules for new asylum-seekers as well as for people waiting to join their refugee relatives in the country, after receiving 160,000 asylum claims last year.
The country has received 245,000 migrants since 2014 -- mostly Syrians, Afghans and Iraqis."

In Eskilstuna, around 110 kilometres west of Stockholm, emergency services got a call at around 11pm that a building, part of a children's summer camp and under consideration for refugee housing, was on fire.
The building, the main structure in the camp complex, burned to the ground. There were no people inside it at the time and no one was injured.
Police are investigating the incident as arson but currently have no suspects.
The local Eskilstuna-Kuriren newspaper reported earlier this month that the municipality was considering using the building as a possible location for the provisional housing of refugees.
In Munkedal, a town of 10,000 inhabitants in south-western Sweden, another fire broke out at the same refugee centre that also burned last week. This time, the blaze was not as extensive and was extinguished quickly.
The area had been cordoned off since the earlier fire and no one was injured in this new incident.
These fires are the latest in a string of suspicious blazes to hit asylum centres in the country. There have been at least 15 since the beginning of this year.
The damage has been cause as more refugees seek asylum in Sweden than in any other point in the nation's history.
On Friday, a political row related to the refugee centre fires flared up. Justice and Migration Minister Morgan Johansson of the Social Democrats reacted strongly to a list of prospective refugee centres published on Facebook by the far-right Sweden Democrats in the city of Lund.
“In a time when refugee centres are being set ablaze, the Sweden Democrats in the city of Lund put out addresses and a map of planned centres. Disgusting!” he wrote on Twitter.
Ted Ekeroth, spokesman for the Lund Sweden Democrats, dismissed the idea that publishing the information would increase the risk of new attacks."

Säpo arrested the man on February 26th on suspicion of aggravated unlawful intelligence activities in the country. He is believed to have illegally obtained intelligence about people related to Tibet in Sweden on behalf of another country.
""The security police has been able to see over time how the man acted in and collected information about the Tibetan group in Sweden. This information is suspected to have then been passed on to intelligence operatives working for a foreign power,"" Säpo said in a press release.

Säpo would not disclose which country he was working for or where in Sweden he was spying, and refused to say whether the foreign power involved was China.
The arrest is the result of ongoing work against illegal intelligence activities in the Nordic nation, Säpo said.

MEL Films released the ""High Chaparral"" documentary about the theme park of the same name in 2016, looking at how the already unusual Wild West style theme park in Sweden became unlikely housing for 500 refugees in the winter of 2015, as Sweden's Migration Agency struggled for rooms during the peak of the refugee crisis.
They weren't content, and recently decided to revisit the park in the sequel ""Return to High Chaparral"". But how did documentary makers from Los Angeles find out about an amusement park in rural Sweden in the first place?
""I had no idea there was an American-style Wild West theme park in Sweden. I didn't know how well that piece of American mythology exported. That could be its own story,"" director David Freid told The Local.

As a small startup competing in the world of big media outlets in LA, the filmmakers have to turn over every stone in order to sniff out intriguing angles. While they knew they wanted to touch on the Syrian refugee crisis for example, they weren't sure how to approach it, until they saw a couple of lines about High Chaparral online, sparking the idea.
When they flew to Sweden, what they found there was a community atmosphere, where people were busy learning Swedish, trying to grasp the intricate Swedish immigration system, and were ""generally active and engaged"" compared to refugees they met in different surroundings. ""High Chaparral was an incredibly unique scenario that would be difficult to replicate,"" the director noted.
""It turned out to be a beautiful story of contrasts, and for the first High Chaparral – of hope. But the political winds have shifted a lot in a year"".
Return to High Chaparral from MEL Films on Vimeo.
Which is why they felt the need to go back. Since 2015, good will towards refugees has given way to backlash, with populist forces in particular making capital out of tensions. When MEL Films returned to the park for their second film, that shift was noticeable.
""There was definitely a change of attitude. The tone of the news coverage was different. There seemed to be less optimism at the park due in large to our timing. We were there on the last day the majority of the refugees had before they had to move on,"" Freid explained.
The residents, on the other hand, seemed grateful for the opportunity they had been given. Though getting a true sense of what they thought was difficult with a camera in the room and a language barrier, the filmmakers admitted:
""Everyone we spoke with remained grateful to have any opportunity at all. They want to contribute and to give back, but it's never easy to get an authentic sense of things when you've got big cameras in a room. Small honest moments were happening in Arabic that we didn't realize until we had the footage translated. A sense of frustration with the situation"".
""It's not easy to stick a camera in a family's face and say 'just act normal' when there's nothing at all normal about their situation,"" he added.
High Chaparral is definitely unique. Photo: MEL Films
In the time since the first film was made, Sweden's stance on refugees has also become big news in the US, where no less than the country's president, Donald Trump, has painted it as a disaster. But that view isn't representative of all Americans, Freid stressed.
""In one version of America, I think Sweden is seen as some failed communist state where immigrant crime is out of control. In another version of America, there's still a belief in the Wild West values of the American settlers – that a person has a right to start a new life away from hardship and persecution. And they generally think Sweden has its shit together,"" he concluded.

Carlos and Rodolfo Luna chatted for an hour with their compatriot at the Vatican, where the new Pope spoke warmly about their adopted country. “Sweden opens its borders, organizes language classes, gives economic assistance, and offers paths to join society,” Pope Francis said reports Vatican Radio. He added that Sweden's policy on welcoming immigrants was at odds with other countries, who he claimed viewed them as a 'bad word.' “We have so many refugees, but no one wants them. They are a ‘bad word.' Jesus was a refugee. He was not a tourist. It was not for work. He was fleeing death. A refugee,"" he said. The current Pope, who succeeded Benedict XVI last March, was full of praise for Sweden who he said has ""great saints"" and said that it was ""nice to find people with such a heart."" Speaking specifically about Sweden's immigration policy, he held the country up as an example for other nations to follow. Last September the Swedish government offered permanent residency to all Syrian refugees who had come to Sweden, in a move that was praised and criticized on both sides of the immigration debate.
""They do not have anyone in a concentration camp and other such terrifying places. That's an example we can present to the world.

The United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR) has purchased 10,000 of the Ikea Foundation's temporary flat-pack shelters, designed to replace canvas and hoop tents currently used in most refugee camps.
The 'Better Shelter' units were first developed and tested as prototypes in 2013 by the Ikea Foundation, Ikea's humanitarian arm, and have a lifespan of three years.
“The refugee housing unit is an exciting new development in humanitarian shelter and represents a much needed addition to the palette of sheltering options mobilized to assist those in need. Its deployment will ensure dramatic improvement to the lives of many people affected by crises,” UNHCR chief of shelter and settlement Shaun Scales said.
The 17.5 square metre shelters come in Ikea style flat-pack cardboard boxes and assembling a unit is said to take around four hours. UNHCR is set to start delivering shelters to thousands of families in refugee camps this summer.
“This is just the beginning. We will continue to develop the Better Shelter and also provide other solutions to benefit the many displaced people. Innovation is our strongest driving force,” Better Shelter's head of business development Johan Karlsson said in a statement.
The ongoing war in Syria has forced nearly four million people to leave their homes, according to the UN. Many have fled across the border into neighbouring countries and some have made it to Europe. Sweden currently takes in more refugees than any other European country per capita.

					11:53 CET+01:00				", The Local,Five myths about Sweden's refugee crisis,"UPDATED: Sweden's reputation for openness is being questioned as it tightens asylum rules and border controls. But how much are attitudes really changing? Here's a truth check on some of the more common misperceptions about how the refugee crisis is affecting the Nordic country.
1. Sweden is closing its borders
Just because Sweden decided to reinstate border controls, it doesn't mean it's closing its borders.
Prime Minister Stefan Löfven did announce in a radical move on November 24th that Sweden was tightening its asylum rules significantly, saying the country was no longer able to accept as many refugees as it had been. It was time, he said, for other EU countries to step up and help out.
However, he said this was not a decision easily made and his deputy Åsa Romson was tearful when she spoke about the new rules. It does not mean Sweden has abandoned its humanitarian principles, simply that it was no longer able to go it alone, with the country expected to take in up to 190,000 refugees in 2015.
Nor does it mean that Sweden has closed its borders. Those who have valid ID documents and are allowed to legally travel into Sweden with a passport or other valid travel documents alone will still be able to do so.
And those who are eligible to seek asylum will still have their applications considered as long as they can provide proof of their identity. However, it is true that Sweden will only accept the minimum level of people it is obligated to according to international conventions.
The decision to reinstate border checks is temporary and valid for 10 days, but can be renewed for up to six months under Schengen regulations on free movement.
Swedish police officials have said that they are preparing to have the controls in place for six months, though Sweden has made no such request yet.
2. Swedes no longer like refugees
A poll published on November 26th found that seven out of ten Swedes backed the government's tightening of asylum rules, ranging from people calling the new measures ""fairly good"" to ""very good"".
However, it does not mean that support for refugees in principle is waning in Sweden. Up until very recently, when local authorities began warning they could no longer manage, surveys were showing very different results. And support remains high for helping those asylum seekers who are in the country.
DEBATE: 'Swedes can still hold their heads high'
A poll from earlier in November found that 41 percent of respondents said Sweden should grant fewer residency permits to refugees -- compared to just 29 percent in September.
Meanwhile a quarter wanted the number to remain at current levels, while 17 percent wanted an increase and 16 percent were undecided.
Sweden, a country of 9.8 million people, has taken more refugees as a proportion of its population than any other country in Europe, and expects to receive up to 190,000 asylum seekers this year – more than double the 80,000 it took in last year.
3. Sweden Democrats are the biggest party now
One pollster, YouGov, has put the Sweden Democrats as the largest party, with 24.8 percent of those polled in October saying they would vote for them, compared 23.2 percent for the Social Democrats and 21.8 percent for the Moderates.
However, other polls, including Ipsos and TNS Sifo, put the Sweden Democrats in third place, on about 17 percent. The most recent survey, on November 26th, conducted by Novus on behalf of TV4 suggested 20.7 percent supported them (but still left it in third place after the Social Democrats and the Moderates).
If that figure was repeated in an election, it would certainly strengthen their position in parliament and prevent either the centre-right or centre-left from forming a majority, but mainstream parties would together still be supported by eight out of ten voters.
Nonetheless, it’s worth noting that the support for the party has increased dramatically since the elections last year, when it pulled in 12.9 percent of the votes.
4. Refugees are being attacked across the country
While it's true that there have been some refugee housing torched in Sweden recently, it's only a tiny proportion of the number of centres in the country.
Considering there are over 100,000 refugees who came to Sweden this year alone, the occasional attack is far from representative of the current attitude towards refugees.
One of the bigger concerns for refugees in Sweden has been settling into life in Scandinavia.
One Syrian who arrived Östersund in rural northern Sweden earlier this year said he loved his new town, but wasn't such a fan of the struggle to find accommodation.
""This city is a small city and a quiet city, and the people here are really, really nice and I like it, but it's a big problem to find an apartment,"" he told The Local.
5. Refugees won't get work and can't integrate
Many refugees want nothing more to get a foot into the job market - a crucial step towards integrating into a new country.
Yet by one important measure Sweden is one of the worst countries in the OECD at getting immigrants into the labour market. Sweden has the largest gap in employment rates between native-born people and immigrants in the OECD. It is particularly bad at integrating immigrants with low skills.
Sweden has spent lots of money on trying to turn this around, with free language training and programmes to help them match their skills with the labour market.
But looked at from another angle, any individual refugee is still more likely to find employment in Sweden than in many other countries, simply thanks to Sweden’s strong economy. The unemployment rate for foreign-born people in Sweden is 21.8 percent, compared to figures in the mid-thirties in Greece or Italy."

Numbers from EU statistical office Eurostat show that among EU Member States with more than 1,000 asylum seekers considered to be unaccompanied minors during 2016, the largest decrease was recorded in Sweden, with over 33,000 fewer applications compared to 2015.
The Nordic nation saw a huge decrease in those applicants of 94 percent, more than Hungary (down 86 percent), Belgium (down 64 percent) and the Netherlands (down 56 percent).
Greece, by comparison, saw its number of asylum seekers considered to be unaccompanied minors increase by 460 percent in 2016 (1,900 more than 2015), while Germany saw a 61 percent increase (13,700 more).
In January, Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationsverket) General Director Mikael Ribbenvik explained that it is now very difficult for unaccompanied minors to reach Sweden:
""It can be explained by the fact that children very often lack ID. It's now difficult to get through without ID at every border control there is in Europe.""
Earlier this month Sweden announced it was ending ID checks on bus, train and ferry crossings with Denmark in favour of tighter border control spot-checks. Migrationsverket says it is too early to tell if the changes have impacted the number of asylum seekers coming to the country.
Unaccompanied minor asylum applicants in Sweden accounted for three percent of all of those registered in the EU last year. That's less than Greece (four percent of the total), Bulgaria (four percent), the UK (five percent), Austria (six percent), Italy (ten percent) and Germany (57 percent).
Lone children made up 20.2 percent of asylum applications from under 18s in Sweden during 2016. That's a significantly lower share than the UK, where they accounted for 33.9 percent, Denmark (49.1 percent) and Italy (53.9 percent). Slovenia had the highest proportion with 57.1 percent.

The majority of asylum applications from unaccompanied minors in EU Member States last year came from Afghans (38 percent) and Syrians (19 percent). Nearly two thirds of Afghan unaccompanied minors were registered in Germany (15,000).
Sweden has been criticised for its handling of unaccompanied refugee children in recent months. In March, an organization tasked with representing the rights of children in Sweden released a report stating that the support provided to children during the asylum process in the country is often inadequate.
The Ombudsman for Children (BO) highlighted the long wait for the children to be appointed a legal guardian in Sweden, sometimes taking up to seven months. The organization has previously raised concerns that refugee children in Sweden are using online forums to plan mass suicides, and are not always receiving the care they need for mental illness."

The test results in 442 of these 581 cases ""suggest that the person examined is 18 years or older"", according to Rättsmedicinalverket. Of these, 430 were men and 12 women.
Its experts also found that five of the test results, all women, ""possibly suggest that the person examined is 18 years or older"" and that in 134 cases (133 males and one female) the examination ""possibly suggests that the person examined is under 18"".
The method of medical age assessment consists of taking X-rays of wisdom teeth, and MRI scans of knee joints, which are then analyzed by dentists and radiologists.
The Migration Agency stressed the figures did not show that asylum seekers who lie about their age represent the majority of applicants, as the tests are only carried out in cases where it believes existing evidence is not enough.
""If all unaccompanied minors had undergone a medical age evaluation then the results would likely have been different,"" Daniel Salehi, a manager at the agency, told Swedish newswire TT. He said the result would then have been the opposite, that most unaccompanied children are indeed under the age of 18.
Over 35,000 asylum applications were made by lone refugee children in Sweden during 2015, followed by 2199 in 2016."

					14:50 CET+01:00				", The Local,Sweden refugees sleep outside for second night,"The Swedish Migration Agency on Friday left newly arrived refugees to sleep outside in the cold for the second night running, although religious and civil organisations eventually stepped in.
As many 25 refugees were last night camped out on the steps of a converted Malmö hotel used by the Swedish Migration Agency to house new arrivals, the doors barred in front of them, as temperatures dropped below freezing.
“We are tired and cold,” one told the local Kvällsposten newspaper. “We have talked to so many journalists already, but it doesn't seen to do us any good.”
According Sweden's TT newswire eventually someone took pity on the group and drove them to the city's main mosque for the night.
""Yesterday was a tough day in the Migration Agency's history,"" Tobias Åkerman, the agency's communication manager for southern Sweden, told The Local. ""For the first time, we had to deny asylum seekers shelter in our accommodation.""
He said that from now men would arrive in Sweden alone without their families would be asked to arrange their own accommodation.
""In this situation, we are forced to tough priorities,"" he said. ""We will give priority to families with children when accommodations are available in the housing system.""
Yelda Azimi, an Afghan who has already spent three years in Sweden, on Friday night told Kvällsposten she could not understand the authorities' failure to help to refugees bedded down outside.
“Why is it only Afghans who sleep here? I do not understand it,” she said. “I'm really sad and worried. When I came here, it was all very nice for me, but now. Why does Sweden do this to them now?”
Malmö NGO Kontrapunkt said that it independently housed more than 130 refugees on Friday night,
On Saturday night, Malmö's St John's Church (Johanneskyrkan) also plans to open its doors.
“We can not see people staying out in this cold in the town,” said Per Kristiansson, the local priest coordinating refugee aid.
“The Gospel tomorrow is about just that. It was a coincidence that it was precisely this weekend,” he added. “I was hungry and you gave me food. I was thirsty and you gave me water. I was a stranger, and you opened your home to me.”
Friday was the second night in a row the agency did not manage to put a roof over the head of some newly arriving refugees.
On Thursday night as many as 30 spent the night outdoors after 600 arrived in just three hours.
“We have entered a new phase where the Migration Agency cannot provide shelter for all,"" chief operating officer Michael Ribbenvik, said in a statement on Thursday evening, announcing that the agency could no longer guarantee accommodation. ""There are not enough places.”"

					13:53 CET+01:00				",AFP/The Local,Swedish police hold man for smuggling refugee,"Swedish police arrested a man early on Sunday as he allegedly tried to smuggle a migrant into the country aboard a rubber dinghy, the first such case since Sweden imposed systematic ID checks, police said.
""This is the first arrest in southern Sweden for suspected human trafficking since the ID checks were introduced"" on January 4th for travellers arriving from Denmark, police spokeswoman Kim Hild said.
A Norwegian sea rescue team had observed the dinghy leaving the Danish town of Helsingor and informed the Swedish coast guard, Hild said.
Swedish police arrested the two men when they came ashore near Helsingborg.
Both were suspected of stealing the dinghy, while one of the men was also arrested on suspicion of human trafficking for trying to smuggle the other into the country.
""One of the men in the boat showed Norwegian documents identifying him as 24 years old. The other man did not have any documents but said he was 27 years old,"" Hild said.
Refugee support groups have expressed fears of human trafficking and dangerous clandestine crossings across the Baltic as a result of Sweden's ID checks.
A country of 9.8 million people, Sweden took in 163,000 asylum seekers last year, more per capita than any other EU nation.
Unable to cope with the unregulated flow of arrivals, it has since January 4 required all travellers to show photo identification when entering from Denmark, the main entry point for migrants into Sweden.
The number of asylum seekers has dropped sharply since then. On January 8, the migration agency said the number of asylum applications received in the first week of January had fallen below 1,500, after receiving almost 10,000 a week for much of October and November."

					12:42 CEST+02:00				", The Local,Refugees try to walk from Denmark to Sweden,"UPDATED: A group of refugees who fled from Rødby station in southern Denmark on Sunday night has now set off on foot towards Sweden, where many of them say they have family members waiting.
Some 60 to 100 refugees left Rødby on the southern Danish island of Lolland on Monday morning with the intention to walk to Sweden. Danish police are escorting the group, which includes men, women and children.

Danish network TV2 spoke with some of the refugees, who said that they did not want to have their fingerprints taken in Denmark and be subjected to processing by Danish authorities under the Dublin rules, which state that the first EU nation to register an asylum seeker must process the claimant’s application.
Some refugees told the broadcaster that they had heard about Denmark’s tougher immigration rules and longer processing times in relation to Sweden, while others said that they had family members waiting for them in Sweden.
“I want to go to Sweden. I like Denmark, but my family is in Sweden. There is no family in Denmark,” one woman who declined to be identified told TV2.
In the below video posted to Twitter, those marching appear to be chanting ""Malmö, Malmö"" as they leave Rødby.

Many of the refugees have been travelling for over a month.
According to TV2, of the estimated 175 refugees who arrived at Rødby Station on Sunday night, just one family – a man with two small children – remained in the town on Monday morning.
Kim Kliver, a spokesman for South Zealand and Lolland-Falster Police, told TV2 that police would not let the refugees out of their sight and suggested that they would be brought back to Rødby for processing rather than be allowed to walk to Sweden.
Travelling to Sweden on foot would take between 40 to 50 hours and would require either ferry connections or walking across bridges that are not open to pedestrian traffic.
Another group of refugees who arrived via train in Røderkro in southern Jutland on Monday morning reportedly refused to get off. According to TV2, the refugees did not want to risk being registered in Denmark and wanted instead to travel further on to either Germany or Sweden.
In a press release, South Jutland Police said that a small confrontation flared up when officers met the group.
“When the officers went to control the travellers, a situation occurred in which a single officer used pepper spray against a traveller when the strain on, among others, a woman with her children became dangerous. The man was subsequently okay,” the release read.
Meanwhile, authorities in the southern Swedish city of Malmö said that around 70 refugees had arrived there on Sunday night and added that they were ready to welcome any others.
Nils Norling, a spokesperson for Swedish police in the region said that “no action” was required by officers, stating that the escaped refugees “have the right to apply to Migrationsverket [Sweden’s Migration Board] for asylum"".
Fredrik Bengtsson, a spokesperson for Migrationsverket in Malmö told the TT news agency that extra staff had been called in and were working to find “around 300 accommodation places, should they be needed”.
“Shuttles between Germany and Denmark run all night and it’s not too far to Malmö,” he said.
Denmark has a tougher approach towards migrants compared to its northern Nordic neighbour. Just over 9,300 Syrians have moved to Denmark over the past year. Meanwhile Sweden has received asylum applications from more than 60,000 people.
Significant cuts in the welfare benefits afforded to asylum seekers were recently introduced in Denmark and the country has introduced one-year temporary residence permits for Syrian refugees and made it harder for them to bring their family members to Denmark."
