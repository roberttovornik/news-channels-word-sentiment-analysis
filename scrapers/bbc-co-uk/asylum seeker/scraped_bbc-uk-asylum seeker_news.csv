The High Court heard the woman, who has links to Bahrain and Sudan, has been refused asylum by the Home Office.
She fears if she leaves for Bahrain she will be trafficked to Sudan and her daughter will be put at risk.
The case, brought by Suffolk County Council, is the first of its kind.
Mr Justice Roderick Newton oversaw a preliminary private hearing in the Family Division of the High Court in London.
Suffolk County Council is the local authority involved in the case.
Barrister James Holmes, who is leading council's team, said a family court judge concluded the girl would be at risk if her mother left for the Middle East.
The girl was made subject of an FGM protection order, he said.
But Home Office officials rejected the woman's asylum application and ordered her removal, the court heard.
She had challenged that removal decision but immigration tribunals, and a judge, rejected her appeals.
Barrister Claire van Overdijk, who is representing the Home Secretary Sajid Javid, told the judge the woman would be allowed to stay in the UK for the next few weeks.
A judge is expected to stage a trial in the near future and hear arguments from lawyers representing social services, the woman, the girl and Mr Javid."

Eritrean Abedom Beyene, 17, arrived in the UK last year after a journey that saw him walk across the Sahara desert.
Cambridgeshire County Council, which said it would not comment on individual cases, placed Abedom in Northampton but has now moved him to Leicester.
A Labour councillor said it undermined his attempts to settle in a community after a traumatic and lengthy journey.
The county council, which said it does not move young people ""unless necessary"", has been in charge of Abedom's welfare as he was detained by police in the county.
He arrived in October last year, following a journey of nearly two years across Africa and Europe.
He was immediately placed in Northampton, where he stayed in a supported living house, before being moved 37 miles (59km) to Leicester in August.
Abedom, who left Eritrea in 2016 as a 14-year-old, said he did not feel happy about having to move from the town and was not given any explanation.
Danielle Stone, opposition Labour leader on Northampton Borough Council and one of Abedom's supporters, said: ""What chance does he have to settle and be accepted if he keeps being uprooted?
""Given that two-year journey and two years' trauma, the fact we had him living with us in our community, such a resilient young man, is extraordinary.
""Sadly, instead of being valued and loved he's just been moved as if what he wants doesn't matter.""
While in Northampton, Abedom emerged as a promising young athlete, joining a running club and making friends in the town. He has run the town's parkrun in 15 minutes 37 seconds.
His coach, Peter Currington, said: ""He has definitely become part of the community.
""Abedom refers to us as his family. Now he's pretty much on his own.""
Abedom said his journey to the UK had been ""full of risk"" and ""a very hard life"".
""I was young and suffering for food,"" he said. ""I saw people dying in front of me [in the Sahara desert].""
He said Libya had been ""full of Mafias"" and ""there was no respect for others or the law"".
The asylum seeker said he had attempted to cross the Mediterranean on a boat with 640 other people on a ""dangerous"" 36-hour journey.
""The boat was broken in the sea,"" he said.
All asylum-seeking children arriving in the UK are accommodated by local authorities. Children's services in these authorities provide accommodation, care and support.
In 2017, more than 34,000 asylum seekers arrived in the UK, including more than 1,100 from Eritrea. Of these, almost 2,400 were unaccompanied asylum-seeking children including 355 from Eritrea.
A spokeswoman for Cambridgeshire County Council said there was a ""shortage of accommodation for all children and young people in care, which means some children and young people are placed outside of Cambridgeshire"".
She added: ""They remain the responsibility of Cambridgeshire County Council."""
https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-manchester-46071135,asylum seeker,411,2 November 2018,None,Andy Burnham's threat to stop housing asylum seekers in Greater Manchester,"Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham has threatened to block the region from housing any more asylum seekers.
He said there was ""mounting chaos"" in the government's dispersal system which was facing ""catastrophic failure"".
Mr Burnham said the region's public services cannot continue to support ""disproportionate"" numbers of people compared with elsewhere in the country.
The Home Office said it took the wellbeing and accommodating of asylum seekers ""extremely seriously"".
Mr Burnham has written to Home Secretary Sajid Javid demanding an urgent meeting over the issue.
He has accused the Home Office of showing ""blatant disregard"" to the issues the region is facing.
In his letter, he said that under the current system the north-west of England hosts 25% of the national population of asylum applicants who require housing and support - with Greater Manchester housing 70% of the region's numbers.
The latest figures show there are currently 6,681 supported asylum seekers in Greater Manchester - a 102% increase since 2003.
The mayor said demand for asylum accommodation had increased by 58% since April 2014.
The dispersal system places high numbers of asylum seekers in some of the country's poorest communities, largely due to the availability of cheap housing.
It means more than 180 local authorities across the country house no asylum seekers at all - including Prime Minister Theresa May's own local authority of Windsor and Maidenhead.
Describing Greater Manchester's compliance with the system as ""voluntary"", Mr Burnham writes: ""It cannot be right that towns in Greater Manchester have more asylum seekers clustered in a handful of wards than entire regions in the rest of the country.""
The mayor raised particular concern about the Home Office's new asylum contract, known as Asylum Accommodation Support Transformation, which will see a new contract replace the current asylum housing provider Serco next year.
In the letter, he adds: ""We fear that the Home Office's approach risks the catastrophic failure of the new asylum dispersal contract due to go live next year.""
A Home Office spokesman said it would respond to the letter ""in due course"" and added: ""We take the wellbeing of asylum seekers and the local communities in which they live extremely seriously.""
It said it worked closely with local authorities across the country ""to deliver on our statutory obligation to house destitute asylum seekers whilst their asylum claims are determined"".
""Officials are working closely with local partners across the North West to understand and address any concerns they may have,"" it added."

The 27-year-old's claim to be gay was deemed ""unbelievable"", in part due to his behaviour, according to reports. He can appeal against the decision.
It comes just days after Amnesty International criticised Austria's asylum processes as ""dubious"".
The government has hit back at the criticism, saying its asylum officials work appropriately.
In the latest case, the Iraqi asylum seeker was felt to exhibit ""stereotypical, in any case excessive 'girlish' behaviour (expressions, gestures)"", which seemed fake, Austria's Kurier newspaper reported.
Said to be an active member in local LGBT groups, he is understood to have fled Iraq in 2015, fearing for his life.
However a spokesman for Austria's asylum office said the decision had been reviewed, and rejected the accusation it contained any ""clichéd phrasing"" by officials in Styria state, Kurier added.
It is the second controversial asylum case in recent days.
Last week, activists said that an 18-year-old Afghan asylum seeker had his application rejected because he did not ""act or dress"" like a homosexual.
""The inhuman language in asylum claims does not conform with the requirements of a fair, rule-of-law procedure,"" Amnesty International said in a report.
Interior Ministry spokesman Christoph Poelzl also rejected the accusation officials used ""inhuman"" language, telling news agency AFP that all employees who assess asylum claims receive training.
However, the official involved in the Afghan asylum seeker's case is no longer involved in assessing applications, he added.
Austria is currently run by a coalition of the conservative People's Party and the far-right Freedom Party, which came to power following an election dominated by Europe's migrant crisis last year."

Mustafa Dawood, 23, had been working illegally at a car wash in Newport when it was raided on 30 June.
He had climbed on to a nearby building and was found under a broken section of plastic roofing, Newport Coroner's Court was told.
The inquest was adjourned for four months as investigations continue.
Immigration officers tried to administer first aid at the scene, the coroner's officer said, and Mr Dawood was taken to the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff where he underwent an emergency scan.
The hearing was told he died from ""un-survivable injuries he sustained"". A doctor issued a death certificate that indicated Mr Dawood had a traumatic brain haemorrhage.
An investigation into what happened at the Shaftesbury Hand Car Wash is being held by the Independent Office for Police Conduct.
The senior coroner for Gwent Wendy James extended her ""condolences and sympathies"" to Mr Dawood's family in Sudan and released his body back to his brother and cousin who were present at the hearing.
Mr Dawood arrived in the UK in 2015 after fleeing a campaign of ethnic cleansing against Darfur's non-Arabs, including the Zaghawa tribe, according to his brother.
Ahmed Dawood said the Home Office had been reconsidering an asylum application for his brother, after rejecting claims he was a member of the Zaghawa tribe.
The asylum seeker had moved to Newport about six months ago and was staying at a property run by a private firm for the Home Office while his final appeal to stay in the UK was considered."

The contractor said it would not begin enforcing the orders until on-going court action had clarified its position.
Campaigners are challenging Serco's plans to evict 330 asylum seekers from their homes in Glasgow.
The issue has prompted days of demonstrations at a Home Office building by protesters in Glasgow.
In a statement issued after the latest protests, Serco said it would ""pause all further lock-change notices to other asylum seekers who have received negative decisions whilst the law is being tested and clarified"".
It added: ""This will also give stakeholders who support asylum seekers more time to prepare for what is likely to be an increase in the number of people seeking their help.""
The Home Office maintains that those who have no right to remain in the country should leave the UK, and accommodation will only continue to be provided temporarily if there is a practical or legal obstacle to that.
The charity Shelter Scotland is to represent two of the asylum seekers at the city's sheriff court next week.
Director Graeme Brown said: ""Our legal team will be presenting papers to Glasgow Sheriff Court on Monday morning along with the legal services agency who act for a third individual to try and get interim orders that will prevent the lock changes threatened to our clients.
""Our clients are actively working with immigration lawyers to resolve their asylum claims. Interim orders temporarily stopping the lock changes will allow this work to continue with our clients having a home to live in.""
Serco chief executive Rupert Soames had said lock-change notices would be given to no more than 10 people a week for the next four weeks.
He said none of these would be families with children and all would be people whom the Home Office considered to have exhausted the appeal process.
More than 100 campaigners, backed by charity Positive Action in Housing, the Church of Scotland and Glasgow Campaign to Welcome Refugees, have taken part in a third day of protests outside the Brand Street Home Office building in Glasgow.
During the demonstration protesters burned letters sent by Serco warning them that they would be evicted.
Campaigners against the planned evictions have said housing associations in the city could be crucial to their efforts.
The charity Positive Action on Housing said it has been encouraged by the housing associations' response to the issue.
They said local associations had pledged practical help for the asylum seekers.
Campaigners hope the housing associations, which own some of the accommodation, can prevent tenants being made homeless.
Parkhead Housing Association said it has already explained its position to Serco.
Chief executive Jim Strang said: ""We wrote to Serco to advise them that in terms of the lease we have with them, they can't change locks without our permission.
""We won't give that permission under the circumstances at the current time.
""We've also indicated to Serco and to the city council that we will - if their tenant in our property is evicted - we will rehouse them.""
Robina Qureshi, the director of Positive Action in Housing, described the evictions as ""immoral, irresponsible and frankly dangerous"".
She said: ""All our efforts this past week have been to avert a humanitarian disaster taking place on our streets as Serco slowly dumps 330 refugees and asylum seekers on to the streets of Glasgow with seven-day notices.
""These notices are being legally challenged in Scotland's highest court, the Court of Session."""

It is hoped the case against Serco and the UK's Home Secretary will be heard in the next few days.
Serco, who are contracted by the Home Office to provide accommodation for asylum seekers, issued notices to six individuals on Monday.
They have been told their locks will be changed in seven days' time.
As a result of the move two Afghan men facing eviction have gone on hunger strike outside the Home Office in Glasgow.
Rahman Shah and Irwais Ahmadzai are among 300 asylum seekers in the city facing eviction by Serco after being refused refugee status.
But Serco says it often has to provide housing without recompense, sometimes for months, for failed former asylum seekers who have no right to stay in the UK.
Historically, lock changes have not been used for those who remain in asylum accommodation despite the Home Office ruling they will not be granted refugee status and withdrawing their funding and support.
Serco insists it is ""sympathetic"" to those affected, but the company has been heavily criticised by politicians and refugee charities, who accuse it of putting profit before people.
About 500 people gathered in the city centre on Tuesday evening to protest against Serco's move and to show solidarity with refugees and asylum seekers, with further protests held on Wednesday.
Glasgow City Council says it is in the process of establishing a task force to respond to the ""emerging humanitarian crisis"" and has written to Home Secretary Sajid Javid urging him to instruct Serco to pause its plans.
A spokesman for the Home Office said asylum seekers who would otherwise be destitute are provided with free, fully furnished accommodation while applications are considered.
On Wednesday Serco responded to the council letter and pledged families will not be put at risk over the next month.
The firm also denied claims it has failed to engage with local authorities and it said it is saving the council a bill in excess of £1m a year for 330 people who are no longer receiving support from the Home Office."

The Times reports that university tuition fees could be cut to £6,500 with the shortfall made up by the Treasury, under proposals from a government commission.
But the paper says if the Treasury makes up the difference, vice-chancellors suspect universities will face cuts in the long run as they fight for funding alongside schools, defence, health and crime.
One vice-chancellor says universities fear the worst ""if it became a choice between dying babies and medieval French"".
Meanwhile, the Guardian says current and former employees of Sir Philip Green's Arcadia Group have spoken to the paper alleging a ""climate of fear, bullying and harassment"" at the company and dismissing his claims that his behaviour was merely ""banter"".
Sir Philip's legal team didn't respond to the paper's request for a comment, but last week he issued a statement strongly denying any allegation of unlawful behaviour.
According to the Telegraph's lead story, improvements in IVF are leading to fewer children being adopted.
The head of the organisation representing children in care in England tells the paper the growing success of fertility treatment means that infertile couples stand a better chance than ever of having their own children.
""Adoption is competing with lots of other ways of having children,"" says Anthony Douglas, of the Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service.
The paper says there were just over 4,000 adoptions last year, compared with about 12,000 at the dawn of fertility treatment in 1978, even though the number of children in care has soared.
The Sun's main story reports that army chiefs have brought in tough new rules to stamp out illegal drug use in the ranks.
For the first time, any soldier who fails a drugs test will be dismissed immediately and banned from rejoining or enlisting with the reserves. Under the old policy, commanders had the discretion to allow soldiers to remain after a failed drugs test if they showed promise or were still in training.
Meanwhile, savers have cashed in a record £5.7bn from their retirement pots so far this year, according to the Daily Express.
The paper reports that the scale of the draw-downs has led to warnings that pensioners may face a lack of cash in later life.
One investment manager said: ""Typically, smaller pensions are being fully withdrawn, while people with larger pensions are making multiple withdrawals in a tax year - suggesting they are treating their pensions more like a bank account.""
Several papers report on the story of a school pupil in Ipswich who is under investigation by the Home Office over concerns he may actually be 30-years-old.
It is the lead story for the Daily Mirror, which says classmates at Stoke High School in Ipswich became suspicious because of his beard.
According to the Daily Mail, he is believed to be an asylum seeker from Iran. It says the row began after a pupil posted a picture of him on social media with a message: ""How's there a 30-year-old man in our maths class?""

Several newspapers also contain pieces about the Sun's story published on Friday which claims former prime minister David Cameron would like to return to politics.
The Mirror suggests that if Mr Cameron wants a cure for his boredom, he could volunteer at one of the four food banks in his former Oxfordshire constituency.
And political commentator Chris Roycroft-Davis writing in the Express, says the income from the lecture circuit is ""not enough to satisfy the ego of a man who realises he will be remembered for all the wrong reasons and wants to try to rewrite history"".
Meanwhile, the country's biggest breakdown companies are leaving motorists who call for help stranded at the side of the road for up to 12 hours, according to an investigation by the Mail.
It claims some customers have been forced to hire independent recovery firms to pick up their car. Others have had to abandon their vehicle and call friends, family or a taxi to pick them up.
Both the AA and the RAC tell the paper that the harsh winter, potholed roads and the long, hot summer put pressure on them - with a large increase in calls for assistance.
And for rail passengers, the Times reports that Network Rail is planning ""one of the biggest shutdowns"" over Christmas, with passengers given as little as six weeks' notice of work on some routes.
It says 330 engineering projects will take place between Christmas and the New Year - 25 per cent more than last year.
The work will affect lines including the West Coast, Great Western, Great Eastern, Midland Main and the main route into Liverpool.
The worst chaos will be around London, where Paddington, Victoria, Euston and Liverpool Street stations will partly shut down.
Network Rail said that the work costing £148 million would create a more efficient service and better facilities. It insisted that the Christmas period was the best time to do it because passenger numbers were halved."

Scarborough Borough Council voted against a Home Office request to become an ""asylum seeker dispersal area"".
Dispersal areas are used to house people while their asylum applications are processed.
Cabinet member for housing Bill Chatt said: ""We don't have the money, the staff or the housing stock to do this.""
More stories from across Yorkshire
Mr Chatt, told councillors more than 2,000 people were on the housing waiting list in Scarborough and raised concerns about the cost of supporting asylum seekers whose applications were refused, according to the Local Democracy Reporter Service.
""My concern is with those who don't achieve asylum who will end up on the streets with nothing,"" the independent councillor said.
""It's alright being a humanitarian but I'm a realist. Our housing stock is not up to it.
""If that makes me a bad man, then I'm a very bad man.""
The decision of the Conservative-run authority to reject the proposal without financial commitments from the Government was criticised by opposition councillors.
Labour group deputy leader Tony Randerson said: ""I was in Beruit in the 60s and saw the horrors people there were trying to get away from.
""Yorkshire folk are meant to be humanitarian aren't we? We should be rolling out the welcome mat for these people.""
According to council papers the Home Office may still impose the scheme but has indicated it is ""prepared to negotiate a specific agreement with North Yorkshire councils to help mitigate any concerns or potential issues"".
Scarborough has previously housed five Syrian families fleeing conflict in their home country in 2017.
A Home Office statement said the UK had a ""proud history"" of granting asylum to those who needed protection.
It said: ""The Home Office maintains an active partnership with local authorities across the UK to plan for the most appropriate dispersal of asylum seekers."""
https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-45087247,asylum seeker,778,7 August 2018,None,'I'd rather die than live on the street' says asylum seeker,"An asylum seeker facing eviction from his accommodation in Glasgow has said he would ""rather die than live on the street"".
Iranian national Khalil Fatahy is one of six people told to leave by Home Office housing contractor Serco.
The bid to evict the asylum seekers has been paused while charities and rights groups challenge it in the courts.
Mr Fatahy told BBC Scotland he just wanted to be given the right to work so he could ""earn his way out"" of poverty.
The Home Office says it is right that people who have failed in their applications for asylum should leave the country.
Serco - a private outsourcing firm which provides accommodation and other services for the government - says it is currently housing 330 people for whom Home Office support has ceased.
About two thirds of this group have been denied asylum, and the firm started efforts to evict people on the basis that it can no longer afford to put them up for free.
After a public outcry this was put on hold, with legal challenges at Glasgow Sheriff Court and the Court of Session in Edinburgh under way to establish whether Serco and the Home Office are on the right side of the law.
Mr Fatahy said he could prove that his life was in danger in Iran due a ""family issue"".
He said he would have nowhere to go if he was forced to leave his accommodation, calling the fate facing the six people initially served with eviction notices ""inhumane"".
He said: ""I would rather die than live on the street. That's just not life. I've been kicked out of my own country, and this one is kicking me out too. My country and this country - there is no difference between them.""
Mr Fatahy, who worked as a merchant in his uncle's business in Iran, said he just wanted to be given the right to work so he could prove he could make his own way in life.
He said: ""I'm not asking for help with housing, or benefits. Just give me the right papers, even with one leg I will survive. I will earn my way out.
""That's all I need, just give me a right to work, just give me a passport and you'll see. I don't need this house, I'll leave it myself.
""I hate the whole idea of the government taking care of me. I want to take care of myself, the government just needs to give me the right papers, the legal rights, and I will earn my way out. I don't like to ask for help, that's not who I am.""
Two men served with eviction notices staged a hunger strike amid protests outside Home Office buildings in Glasgow, while the city council wrote to the UK government claiming there would be a ""humanitarian crisis"" if hundreds of asylum seekers were left destitute.
Shelter Scotland, which is representing two asylum seekers in the legal challenges, said the evictions were a ""deplorable and inhuman course of action"".
However Secro insists that its approach is ""fully within the law"", and welcomed the court action as providing clarity on this point.
The Home Office said that while ""those who have no right to remain"" should leave the UK, it would ""still provide accommodation for those who would otherwise be destitute"" if they are temporarily unable to go.
UK Immigration Minister Caroline Nokes is expected to meet Scottish government ministers later to discuss the evictions issue.
Govan Law Centre, which had also lodged a case at the Court of Session in Edinburgh, said on Monday evening that eviction proceedings against two asylum seekers it was representing had been dropped by Serco.
It said the case would still go before the Court of Session, though, in order to debate the legal principles.
Mr Fatahy, who has lodged a fresh claim for asylum, said he wanted the system to ""see me as a human being"".
He said: ""I was already unhappy, probably in the worst place in life, but this just came on top of it. Where do I go, how do I live?
""I came to a country where it is known for democracy and equality, but have I been given that? What Britain is bragging about - I don't feel that at all.
""I want to be treated equally. If people in Glasgow are unhappy, I want to be unhappy. If they are happy, I want to feel that happiness.
""I just want to be a citizen of Glasgow, to be treated like one. I want to share my experience with them and them to share their experience with me."""

Mohamed Amin, 39, targeted his victim after she became separated from friends and dropped her phone down a drain during a night out in Cardiff in 2015.
He fled to Ireland, but was brought back to Wales and found guilty of rape.
At Newport Crown Court Amin was sentenced to 14 years - 10 in jail and four on licence - and will be deported back to Egypt afterwards.
The court heard how Amin, who came to the UK in 2012 as an asylum seeker from Egypt, had spotted his 18-year-old victim trying to recover her phone from a drain in January 2015.
A police officer who spotted her said she was ""very distressed"" and was trying to pull off the drain cover to get at her phone.
Amin pretended to help, before persuading her to get in a taxi back to his home, the court heard.
There, he pushed her into a shower and washed her down before raping her.
Amin fled the UK, but in April 2017 he was found and arrested in Dublin, and brought back to face trial.
In an impact statement, his victim said she blamed herself for the attack and considered ending her life.
Reading from the statement, prosecutor Roger Griffiths said she was left feeling ""dirty and abused"".
He said she developed an eating disorder which she believed would have killed her if it had not been for the support of her family and friends.
""This will stay with me for life. I do not know when my mind will escape from this trauma, or when I will be able to get a full night's sleep,"" the statement said.
Ruth Smith, defending, said Amin had no previous convictions and a family in Egypt he had not been able to provide for following his arrest.
Judge Thomas Crowther said he ""presented a serious risk of causing further significant harm to women"".
He added: ""You spotted a very distressed young woman and manipulated her into a position where she thought you were an ally or a friend, and having done so you took advantage of her."""

But Holyrood still has plenty going on.
The justice committee will take evidence from Police Scotland's Chief Constable Iain Livingstone and Scottish Police Authority chair Susan Deacon on the legislation which saw the merger of eight regional police forces into Police Scotland.
Both agencies have been the subject of controversy since the formation of on police force in April 2013.
And what else for this week?
Labour MSP Colin Smyth brings forward his member's debate on Tuesday evening on banning the export of live animals.
An BBC investigation into live calf exports in September led to renewed calls for the practice to end.
The Scottish government insisted the transport of animals was important for Scottish agriculture, though it accepted this must be done humanely.
Before this though, MSPs will debate how to maximise the benefits of digital inclusion and increase access to digital technologies.
Topical questions will also take place and no doubt the UK budget will come up.
The Scottish Conservatives take to the floor this week, scheduling in two debates.
The first will be on transport - precise topic to be confirmed - and the second will be on early years education.
This will most likely be used to raise concerns that private nurseries will not be able to offer the full 1,140 hours of free childcare by 2020.
A series of freedom of information requests made by the party highlighted these concerns, as well as a lack of engagement by the government with partners and a lack of access to capital funding.
The member's debate in the evening will be led by SNP MSP Joan McAlpine, pointing to efforts to restore pinewood forests.
In the morning, the rural economy committee will receive an update on agriculture from Rural Economy Secretary Fergus Ewing.
He will face questions on Common Agricultural Policy payments, farming frameworks, the good food national bill and the recent outbreak of so-called 'mad cow disease' in Aberdeen.
Issues related to the UK government's budget may dominate first minister's questions at noon on Thursday as MSPs get to grips with how it will impact Scotland.
After that, SNP MSP Ruth Maguire uses her member's business to celebrate outdoor classroom day.
Two ministerial statements are scheduled for after lunch; the first is on the annual emissions target report while the second will be an update on the Aberdeen bypass.
Scotland has met all its emissions targets in recent years so questions on the statement may focus on the new legislation, which some MSPs are arguing is not ambitious enough.
Meanwhile, the Aberdeen bypass is scheduled to open this autumn following lengthy delays.
Ending the week will be a debate on support for asylum seekers. It comes after protests in Glasgow in August about the asylum seeker accommodation.
Emergency funding of £100,000 was provided by the Scottish government to assist the third sector with doubling the provision of stable and safe places to live."

Rekar Ahmed, 17, suffered a fractured spine and a bleed to the brain after being beaten up in Croydon last year and spent days in an induced coma.
Over two trials, five defendants, aged between 18 and 21, were found guilty of two counts of violent disorder.
All were sentenced at Croydon Crown Court, along with James Neves, 23, who admitted one count of violent disorder.
Mr Ahmed also suffered facial fractures when he and his friends were attacked near The Goat pub on Broom Road, in Shirley, Croydon.
Following the attack, Mr Ahmed was treated King's College Hospital - and £59,000 was raised online for him.
The Met Police said about 20 people were involved in the assault on 31 March.
A total of 17 were arrested, of whom 14 were subsequently charged.
On 9 November, Kurt Killick, George Walder and Lliam Neylon were all convicted of two counts of violent disorder.
The second trial finished on 1 February with George Jeffrey and Ben Harman both being found guilty of two counts of violent disorder.
Mitigation for the six men was heard at Croydon Crown Court during a sentencing hearing on March 2.
During a victim impact statement Mr Ahmed told the court he has since tried to take his own life, that he has nightmares and flashbacks and does not sleep properly.
At the sentencing Walder, of Myrtle Road; Neylon, of Ferris Avenue; Harman, of Akabusi Close and Jeffrey, of Uvedale Close were each jailed for 50 months.
Killick, of Court Wood Lane, was sentenced to 40 months in prison and Neves, of Eastwell Close, Beckenham, was told to serve 28 months behind bars.
All six men were each told to pay a £170 victim surcharge."
http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-42540593,asylum seeker,471,2 January 2018,None,Germany migrants: Doctors oppose asylum seeker age tests,"German doctors have spoken out against proposals for young asylum seekers to undergo mandatory medical tests to ascertain their age.
The German Medical Association (Bundesärztekammer) said the checks were ethically wrong and unreliable.
Conservative politicians have called for tests such as X-rays to make sure young migrants are not lying about being under 18 to avoid deportation.
It follows outrage over the killing of a girl, allegedly by an Afghan migrant.
The 15-year-old was stabbed with a kitchen knife outside a shop in Kandel, in south-western Germany, last week.
An Afghan refugee, who says he is the same age, is accused of attacking her after she broke off their relationship.
After the killing, the girl's father said of the suspect: ""There's no way he is ever only 15... We hope that through the process we will now know his true age.""
Chancellor Angela Merkel's Bavarian allies, the CSU, wants all young asylum seekers to undergo medical tests if their age is in doubt. Methods include doing an X-ray on the hand to assess bone development, or measuring teeth.
But Frank Ulrich Montgomery, president of the German Medical Association, said the tests had a large margin of error.
""The investigations are complex, expensive and burdened with great uncertainties,"" he told the Süddeutsche Zeitung.
""If you were to do this with every refugee it would be an interference in their human welfare.""
German experts believe many young male migrants lie about being under 18 to get better access to housing and support.
Currently officials try to determine the age of new arrivals through verbal interviews, while medical tests are voluntary.
The CSU says it will push for the tests to become compulsory in coalition talks with the Social Democrats, who oppose such a move.
""I want everyone who comes into our country and claims to be a teenager to be medically checked for their age,"" said the CSU's Joachim Herrmann, Barvaria's interior minister.
""Young people cost the state more money in special care and have a lower criminal liability. The state can not basically leave it that way.""
The killing of the teenage girl in Kandel is the latest case to spark calls for age testing in Germany.
An Iranian asylum seeker is already on trial for allegedly raping and killing a 19-year-old student in Freiburg in October last year. He initially claimed to be 16, but his own father told a court he was 33.
A note on terminology: The BBC uses the term migrant to refer to all people on the move who have yet to complete the legal process of claiming asylum. This group includes people fleeing war-torn countries such as Syria, who are likely to be granted refugee status, as well as people who are seeking jobs and better lives, who governments are likely to rule are economic migrants."
http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-41567761,asylum seeker,472,10 October 2017,None,Torture survivors win asylum seeker detention ruling,"Survivors of torture have won a legal challenge against Home Office rules on asylum seeker detention in the UK.
The government had argued torture could only be carried out by official state agents or terror groups with territory.
But survivors and the charity Medical Justice argued that definition was too narrow and should include victims of trafficking and other abuses.
The Home Office has said it will not appeal against the ruling, which could affect hundreds of cases.
Under official guidelines, people classed as victims of torture should be housed in private accommodation - provided by the government or family members already living in the country - while their asylum claims are processed.
But the court was told that the new definition led to ""many"" detainees, including victims of trafficking and rape, no longer being recognised as victims of torture and therefore being locked up in detention centres instead.
That was despite doctors submitting evidence of their torture and ill-treatment, the judge was told.
Mr Justice Ouseley ruled that Home Office policy on torture survivors ""lacked a rational or evidence basis"".
This ruling will have a profound effect - both symbolically and in practical terms.
It means there's less risk that asylum seekers who come to Britain severely traumatised after being persecuted, abused or trafficked will be detained.
Medical experts say that's hugely important because detention can lead to a deterioration in the mental health of those who've suffered ill treatment before.
It's also a reminder to the Home Office to ensure it acts within the law when it introduces measures, even apparently minor changes, which affect the welfare of people seeking refuge in the UK.
Seven people who had sought sanctuary in Britain after being raped, abused or trafficked were among those detained under the new policy because they were not classed as torture victims.
But the High Court said the Home Office had acted unlawfully, because the new rules excluded people who were vulnerable to harm in detention.
Two-tier system 'leaves refugees destitute'
Mr Po, one of the former detainees who was part of the legal challenge, welcomed the decision.
""The policy allowed the Home Office to turn a blind eye to my suffering and the suffering of hundreds of other torture survivors,"" he said.
""Although I welcome the decision, it is still upsetting that the Home Office, who should protect people like me, rejected me and put me in detention which reminded me of the ordeal I suffered in my country of origin.""
David Isaac, chairman of the Equality and Human Rights Commission, which intervened in the case, said: ""This unlawful policy has been scrapped, but the government should now go further and strengthen the human rights protections for people in immigration detention.""
The Home Office said it was looking at how best it could consider the court's findings."

The picture of the market in Ravensburg, southern Germany, was uploaded on Thursday evening, prompting police quickly to boost security.
The Afghan later admitted uploading the image, saying it had been a joke.
He is to face charges of making threats to commit crime.
His accommodation was searched but investigators found nothing to suggest the threat was real, police said in a statement.
Last year a Tunisian asylum seeker drove a lorry at people visiting a Christmas market in Berlin, killing 12 and injuring 49.
In October an investigation into the attack revealed mistakes by German police and security services.
It said police missed several chances to arrest and deport attacker Anis Amri, who fled Berlin after the attack but was later shot dead by police in Italy."

Samim Bigzad said he spent five days hiding from gunmen in a Kabul hotel before being returned to the UK.
Home Secretary Amber Rudd is accused of contempt of court, but the Home Office says the order to take Mr Bigzad off a flight from the UK came ""too late"".
The 23-year-old, who was living in Kent, is now re-applying for asylum.
Law firm Duncan Lewis, representing Mr Bigzad, says the injunction was granted while he was waiting for the flight, and commenced contempt of court proceedings after the Home Office put him on that flight.
Mr Bigzad, who is back with a foster family in Ramsgate, said he was forced out of Afghanistan because the Taliban threatened to behead him for working with American firms in his job.
""The Home Secretary is just playing with my life,"" he said.
""When I came back to England I feel like I've come back to my home, I kissed the ground and I feel safe.""
But, a Home Office spokesman said: ""We took action to comply with the court order and worked to return Mr Bigzad as soon as possible despite significant logistical challenges in securing the necessary documentation and limited flight availability.
""We maintain that it was too late to disembark Mr Bigzad from the Istanbul to Kabul flight by the time the injunction was served, some 10 hours after the removal process began.""
Mr Bigzad came to the UK in 2015 to look after his father, who lives in Margate and suffers from Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome (PTSD).
He said: ""I hope in the future just to play my cricket and study English and look after my dad."""

The soldiers would assist with fencing and support at key points along the southern border, administration officials tell CNN.
The caravan of thousands of Central American migrants is making its way toward the US through Mexico.
President Donald Trump said on Thursday he was ""bringing out the military"".
""I am bringing out the military for this National Emergency,"" Mr Trump said of the migrant caravan in a tweet, hinting of an upcoming deployment. ""They will be stopped!""
Secretary Mattis' order is in response to a request from President Trump, according to the Associated Press.
Mr Trump first threatened such action last week, saying he would use the military to completely close the US-Mexico border. He also threatened cutting aid to Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras.
It remains unclear whether these 800 troops will be National Guard or active military forces, but the Washington Post reported an official saying some active Army personnel would be deployed.
There are already thousands of National Guard troops supporting border officials - 2,100 unarmed troops are at the border presently - but 4,000 have been approved for deployment by the Pentagon.
The president has called sending troops to the Mexico border a ""big step"", but both his predecessors also dispatched the National Guard there.
President Barack Obama sent some 1,200 soldiers to guard the boundary, while President George W Bush deployed about 6,000 troops to help Border Patrol in what was called Operation Jump Start.
Both deployments lasted for around a year.
The caravan is presently near Mapastepec, Chiapas state, Mexico. They are reportedly heading towards the town of Pijijiapan, but it will still take weeks for them to reach the US border.
A spokesman for the United Nations said more than 7,000 people had joined the migrant caravan as of 22 October, citing estimates from the International Organisation for Migration.
But the group has split up, which makes it difficult to determine the exact number.
The migrants say they are fleeing persecution, poverty and violence in their home countries of Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador.
On Thursday, Mr Trump once again urged the migrants to stay away, tweeting: ""To those in the Caravan, turn around, we are not letting people into the United States illegally.""
To those in the Caravan, turnaround, we are not letting people into the United States illegally. Go back to your Country and if you want, apply for citizenship like millions of others are doing!
End of Twitter post by @realDonaldTrump
Many of the migrants say they plan to seek asylum in the US.
There is a legal obligation under international law to hear asylum claims from migrants who have arrived in the US if they say they fear violence in their home countries.
But in June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced that victims of domestic abuse and gang violence would no longer generally qualify for asylum in the US.
Those seeking asylum must be fleeing due to a serious fear of persecution in their home country. Under international law, these are considered refugees.
If an asylum seeker enters the US illegally, they are still entitled to a hearing of their claim.
Economic migrants are those seeking a better quality of life - and even if they are fleeing devastating poverty, they are not considered refugees and do not have the same protections.
The mid-term elections are less than two weeks away and critics say Mr Trump has used the threat of illegal immigration to fire up his supporters.
In addition to ramping up his harsh rhetoric against migrants at rallies in recent weeks, the president has also made statements painting them as criminals without offering any evidence.
Mr Trump's increased anger at Central American migrants comes at a time when many Latinos in the US are worried about their place in the nation, according to a new Pew Research Center study.
Half of all Latinos polled said their situation has worsened in the past year and 55% fear someone close to them could be deported."

Austria's Herbert Kickl put forward the idea at an EU migration conference in Vienna and his Italian counterpart, Matteo Salvini, supported it.
Hundreds of thousands of migrants try to reach the EU in risky sea crossings.
Mr Kickl said ships would use a ""quick way"" to clarify who was entitled to asylum but he did not give details.
Mr Salvini is under investigation in Italy for refusing to let rescued migrants disembark in Italy last month.
Prosecutors in Sicily have opened an inquiry into possible illegal confinement, illegal arrest and abuse of power.
Outlining his plan at a joint news conference with Mr Salvini on Friday Mr Kickl said that after ""appropriate checks"" on board ship, those migrants entitled to asylum could be brought to the EU while the rest would be taken to ""safe ports"" in third countries.
""You are well looked after on a ship,"" Mr Kickl said, adding that the system would help solve the ""problem of repatriation"".
""Once people have set foot on the continent, you can only remove them with great difficulty and much expense,"" he told reporters.
He said EU asylum policy should aim to make it ""impossible to claim asylum except from outside the EU, and that claims be decided outside the EU"".
Mr Salvini said he was absolutely in favour of the plan. Italy is one of the main entry points for migrants making the dangerous journey across the Mediterranean with the hope of a new life in the EU.
However, the Austrian office of the medical charity Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) condemned the idea.
""This proposal is simply another attempt to distract attention from the real issue, namely the inability of Europe and of Austria's EU presidency to find a sustainable solution to the humanitarian crisis in the central Mediterranean and Libya,"" the group said in a statement.
It urged EU leaders to ""put the protection of human life at the centre of their efforts"".
Since 2014, more than 640,000 migrants have landed on Italy's shores. Although many have since left for other countries, some remain.
The UN says that more than 1,600 people have lost their lives trying to cross into Europe in 2018, despite overall numbers being down.
In July, 450 migrants were allowed to disembark in Sicily once France, Germany, Malta, Portugal and Spain had agreed to take 50 migrants each."

Mr Bigzad landed at 22:45 BST and was allowed to return to his foster family.
Jamie Bell, from law firm Duncan Lewis, which has been representing Mr Bigzad, met him at Heathrow airport.
He said: ""This has been a very long and difficult week. For everyone involved it's been both emotionally and physically draining. But seeing Samim arrive back last night made it all worthwhile.
""He couldn't quite believe he was back and allowed to walk away free. He kept putting his head on the ground and saying how happy he was to be back.
""When he saw his foster family and his friend from KRAN he was so happy, it was a really lovely moment.""

He said the Home Office had made an application to the Court of Appeal for Mr Bigzad to stay in Kabul but it was refused.
The firm has now commenced contempt of court proceedings against the Home Office for the decision to put him on the flight despite the order and has begun his application for asylum.
Ms Rudd told the Andrew Marr Show: ""I will make sure we do the right thing.""
She added that she took the matter ""very seriously"" and said ""I will look carefully at the information and make sure we abide by the law as we always do"".

He is accused of shooting unarmed or wounded soldiers following a battle in Homs, Syria.
His lawyers have said that he was severely traumatised at the time.
The man - who has not been named - denies the charges. According to Der Standard, he is a stateless Palestinian who grew up in a refugee camp in Homs.
Austrian media said the suspect told others at a refugee shelter that he had shot dead government soldiers when he was fighting with an Islamist rebel group called the Farouq Brigade, linked to the Free Syrian Army.
According to reports, the suspect was placed under investigation when officials were alerted to his account of events in Syria last year.
Austria is unable to extradite the man to face charges in Syria because of the ongoing civil war.
The decision to try him in the country for his alleged crimes committed elsewhere is thought to be a first in Austria.
Killing injured soldiers is prohibited under the Geneva Convention.
Officials have said the actions that he has allegedly described qualified as terrorism and could be prosecuted under international counter-terrorism agreements."

According to Der Standard, he is a stateless Palestinian who grew up in a refugee camp in Homs.
The suspect was placed under investigation when officials were alerted to his account of events in Syria last year.
Austria is unable to extradite the man to face charges in Syria because of the ongoing civil war there.
Killing injured soldiers is prohibited under the Geneva Conventions on the laws of war.
Officials had previously said the actions that he had allegedly described qualified as terrorism and could be prosecuted under international counter-terrorism agreements.
The Geneva Conventions are founded on just a few basic principles:
Medical staff and hospitals in warzones must be protected and allowed to work freely.
Those wounded in battle and no longer fighting are entitled to medical treatment.
Prisoners of war must be treated humanely.
Warring parties are obliged to protect civilians (this includes a prohibition on the targeting of civilian infrastructure such as power and water supplies).

One man said worrying if he would be deported left him thinking ""what is the point in life"".
""You can't sleep, you can't eat,"" said the man, who joined calls for asylum seekers to be able to work while their appeals are heard.
It comes after one worker fell to his death during a raid in Newport.
But the Home Office said the rules, which mean asylum seekers are not allowed to work in the UK, were to protect the resident labour market and asylum seekers could get support until their appeal was determined.
Mustafa Dawood, 23, had been working at a car wash in the Newport while his appeal was being considered but fell from a roof while fleeing from immigration officers in June.
BBC Wales spoke to one man in Newport, who does not wish to be named, who said he thought he had been ""forgotten"" by the Home Office as his last contact was in late 2016.
""Mustafa, like me had been waiting, he got work, he needed money to buy some stuff.
""If I was able to work it would be better, it would be better than being stuck at home in the same routine, it would take my mind off the decision.
""You can't sleep, you can't eat, it's hard. Sometimes I think about crazy stuff. I think why do I stay in this life. I think, what is the point in life?
""Other people are worse than me, my friends, when we walk together they keep talking about killing themselves.""
He added: ""I hope the Home Office will change these kind of rules and allow people to work and to answer people more quickly, not take one or two years.
""It's not fair. We are suffering.""
According to the Wales Strategic Migration Partnership there were 2,910 asylum seekers in Wales receiving some form of support in the first quarter of 2018.
Managers at the Sanctuary Project, which supports asylum seekers, believe Mr Dawood would still be alive if he had been able to work legally.
Project manager Sarah Croft said: ""Mustafa shouldn't have been working, we know that. But honestly this system drives people to make bad choices.
""Had Mustafa been told you can go to work legally, then he wouldn't have been fearful of those authorities when they arrived.
""I would like to see asylum seekers be given the right to work if the Home Office can't meet their guidelines.
""Maybe limited hours, but it would improve their mental health. Many of the people who use our service are accessing primary mental health services and, maybe this could be alleviated were they given the right to work.""
Home Office guidelines state an asylum decision on straightforward cases ""will usually be decided within six months"".
However support workers at The Sanctuary said ""few"" people are given a decision within this period, with some having to wait years.
The Irish government announced in June that asylum seekers waiting longer than nine months for a decision will be allowed to work, with few restrictions on the type of employment.
The Sanctuary said it has the support of other organisations across the UK and will be writing to Home Secretary Sajid Javid about following suit.
A Home Office spokesman said: ""Asylum seekers are not allowed to work in the UK unless their claim has been outstanding for at least 12 months through no fault of their own.
""This policy is designed to protect the resident labour market to prioritise access employment for British citizens and those lawfully resident here, including those granted refugees status.
""Asylum seekers who would otherwise be destitute can obtain support under section 95 of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 from the time they arrive in the UK, until their claim is fully determined and they have exhausted their appeal rights."""

Habibur Chowdhury, paid Mohammed Manik just over half the minimum wage to work a 72-hour week.
Chowdhury's Ashiana restaurant was raided in June 2015 following a tip-off about illegal immigrants working there.
He later told police he had nothing to do with the restaurant and claimed not to know who Mr Manik was.
His defence agent described 60-year-old Chowdhury as ""wilfully blind"" when it came to checking the Bangladeshi national's papers.
Mr Manik told Home Office investigators he ""felt exploited"" by Chowdhury.
Depute fiscal Eilidh Robertson previously told Dundee Sheriff Court that Mr Manik had applied for asylum but had been refused.
She said: ""He couldn't support himself and was living in Glasgow.
""He explained his predicament to a friend who put him in touch with the accused who offered him a job in Dundee.""
The court was told Mr Manik was paid cash to work six days a week for 12 hours a day.
Miss Robertson said: ""He was paid £300 a week regardless of how much he worked.""
Chowdhury, of Dundee, admitted employing someone who had not been granted leave to enter or remain in the UK.
Sheriff Alastair Brown imposed a restriction of liberty order confining Chowdhury to his home address from 19:00 to 07:00 every day for six months.
Sheriff Brown said: ""It seems reasonably clear that the UK government and a significant proportion of the UK public is exercised about immigration.
""The laws are there to protect the vulnerable.
""The picture I get from your record, this offence and your attitude to the social workers preparing reports in this case is of a man who regards regulatory rules with an arrogant attitude that they don't apply to him unless he so chooses."""

Kurdish MP Faysal Sariyiliz, who visited Reker Ahmed in hospital, said the 17-year-old was ""very pleased to be alive"" after the assault
The teenager was beaten and kicked by a gang while waiting at a bus stop in Croydon on Friday night.
Police are still looking for five males over the attack.
Mr Sariyiliz visited the Kurdish-Iranian teenager with Zinar Demeni, from the Kurdistan Solidarity Campaign.
He told the BBC, Reker had said ""the number of people attacking him"" had made him fear he would be killed.
Mr Demeni said the victim was still ""in pain"" and that ""his body was battered and... he wasn't able to move much.""
""I told him that many British people in the UK are behind you, they support you, they condemn this attack,"" he added.
""When he heard this, and heard how many people were supporting him, this put a huge smile on his face.""
The 17-year-old suffered a bleed on his brain, a fractured eye socket and fractured spine in the attack.
He was visited by his brother Hadi Ahmed on Tuesday, who said Reker had not recognised him.
A demonstration by Kurds was held in Croydon earlier.
Thirteen people, aged between 15 and 24, have been charged with violent disorder in relation to the attack.
A total of 16 people have been arrested. Three of those will face no further action."
http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-45022272,asylum seeker,513,31 July 2018,None,Council taskforce to help asylum seekers facing eviction,"Glasgow City Council has set up a taskforce in a bid to help up to 300 asylum seekers facing eviction.
The move comes as a lawyer claimed Home Office contractor Serco planned to ""act unlawfully"" after families were notified their locks would be changed.
Hundreds of people staged a protest against the plans outside the city's Buchanan Galleries on Tuesday.
Serco said it has been providing free housing for former asylum seekers with no right to stay in the UK.
The council taskforce will work with Third Sector partners and legal charities to offer advocacy and support services to those affected.
Council leader Susan Aitken and chief executive Annemarie O'Donnell have also written to the Home Secretary, warning of a ""humanitarian crisis"".
On Monday, Serco - which provides accommodation for asylum seekers on behalf of the Home Office - issued six of those affected with a notice that their locks would be changed within seven days.
Historically, lock changes have not been used for those who remain in asylum accommodation despite the Home Office ruling they will not be granted refugee status and withdrawing their funding and support.
Mike Dailly, of Govan Law Centre, said his solicitors were working with MPs, the local authority and charities to identify those affected with a view to raising legal proceedings to prevent summary evictions.
He said: ""These are very vulnerable families living in our city and they deserve full legal protection to ensure that due process is being followed.
""We have a number of our senior lawyers looking at this right now.
""We are convinced that Serco are proposing to act unlawfully.""
Mr Dailly pledged to take cases before the courts.
He added: ""This is a complex area of law and it's very unlikely vulnerable people can just be summarily evicted in the way Serco propose.
""Scots common law has long since prohibited eviction without due process of law against residential occupiers.
""In Scotland, it is generally necessary to obtain a decree for ejection from the court as opposed to taking the law into you own hands - known as summary eviction or eviction brevi manu - which is generally a criminal offence and a civil wrong.""
The lock change plan has sparked condemnation from members of all major political parties, except the Conservatives, with councillors and MPs teaming up to write to the Home Secretary calling for a U-turn.
The letter from Glasgow City Council leader Susan Aitken warned that those evicted were more likely to become homeless than leave the UK and said it risked creating a ""humanitarian crisis"" in the city, placing people at ""imminent risk of significant harm"".
Serco said it had been providing housing free of charge and without recompense from the Home Office, in some cases for months, for ex-asylum seekers with no right to stay in the UK.
The company said it was sympathetic to those affected but believed it had been ""more than supportive"" and had started legal proceedings for repossession as these residents ""no longer have any right to continue to live in the property we provide""."
http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-politics-38196583,asylum seeker,535,4 December 2016,By James Williams,Poor asylum seeker housing conditions criticised,"The sub-standard condition of some housing for asylum seekers in Wales is ""an accident waiting to happen"", according to the Welsh Refugee Coalition.
Problems seen by BBC Wales include broken fire alarms, leaking plumbing, damp, and broken electrical sockets.
Clearsprings Ready Homes which provides all asylum accommodation in Wales declined to comment.
The Home Office said it was committed to providing safe, secure housing.
According to the latest statistics, there are 2,495 people in Wales currently seeking asylum.
While their claims are being processed, they are not allowed to work but can receive somewhere to live.
Sohail Ahmed, 25, who fled Pakistan in 2012, has been seeking asylum in the UK since June and has been housed in Cardiff for the past two months.
BBC Wales' Sunday Politics programme visited where he lives and saw issues including a defective mains powered fire alarm, a window that did not close properly, damp carpets, a leaking kitchen sink and bath and broken furniture.
Mr Ahmed said: ""When I came here and then see all this situation, I call them [Clearsprings Ready Homes] many times, they are making promises but since that time nothing has happened.
""At the end of the day we are still human. I'm standing here not only for myself.
""I do believe that if I'm suffering hard from these things, there are many thousands of people who are suffering from these things.""
Clearsprings Ready Homes has a £119m contract with the UK government to provide all asylum accommodation in Wales.
It is due to expire next year but the Home Office is considering an extension.
The company was criticised earlier this year over concerns about a policy which required people at its Lynx House centre in Cardiff to wear wristbands to allow them to get food.
The bands were later scrapped.
AM Bethan Jenkins, who is a member of the assembly's equality, local government and communities committee, which is conducting an inquiry into refugees and asylum seekers, said she was aware of the issues.
""There are other families across Swansea, some of whom I've visited, who are experiencing the same things,"" the Plaid Cymru South Wales West AM said.
""They're coming into houses that are very old, very damp, with numerous problems and really they should be fit for purpose before the asylum seekers are housed here.""
Speaking on behalf of the Welsh Refugee Coalition, Hayley Richards, said there had been problems with the quality of asylum housing in Wales for many years.
""Asylum seekers are some of the most vulnerable people in our communities. And the standard of housing these people are expected to live in, you wouldn't see any other publicly funded housing in Wales of that condition,"" she said.
""There are serious issues in terms of health and safety, so it's just an accident waiting to happen before something awful happens within asylum accommodation,"" she said.
Clearsprings Ready Homes declined to comment but in a response to inquiries made by Ms Jenkins, the firm acknowledged that ""clearly there is an issue that needs urgent investigation"".
A Home Office spokesperson said it was ""committed to providing safe and secure accommodation"" and if problems were not resolved by contractors it could impose sanctions."

The practice of orators surrounding themselves with a ring of supporters, who can be counted upon to nod sagely at the appropriate point.
This habit probably dates back to ancient times. I mean, Marcus Tullius Cicero was seldom slack when it came to speechifying.
But even he occasionally resorted to assembling his chums around him to mutter ""bene dictum"", when appropriate, or to grind their teeth every time Mark Anthony rose to his feet.
But there is an added ingredient in today's doughnut recipe - the all-pervasive influence of television.
Top politicians don't want just any doughnut. They want a tasty confection which appeals to the viewing voters.
So every party - OK, every party with enough elected members - contemplates doughnuts, strategically.
We've seen it in the SNP at Holyrood. Members racing each other to the chamber in order to be there, perspiring but casual, in the background when Nicola Sturgeon faces her weekly question session.
Now it's spread to Labour. There was apparently a full and frank exchange of views among some comrades this afternoon on the topic of seating in the chamber.
I'm told it has been the regular practice in the People's Party to decide which people should sit where, around the leader. There was a routine list of names for the first two rows.
But today, horror of horrors, it seemingly spread to the third row. This was too much. Hence the brief outbreak of warm words.
Eventually, they all settled down to the task of interrogating the first minister. Labour's Richard Leonard - who doesn't have to fight for a chair - raised the topic of student debt.
The SNP, he recalled, had once promised to wipe out student debt. Now, he said, the level of debt was rising.
He made this point at some length. The duration of his question, indeed, was such to prompt Ms Sturgeon to suggest that a university degree course could be completed in a shorter timescale.
Mind you, since some of the first minister's answers were notably prolonged, perhaps it was a little unfair. However, she said that the Scottish system of support for students was easily the best and fairest in these islands.
Earlier, Jackson Carlaw for the Tories had set out to attack the FM over tax. Wasn't it ""miserable"", he said, that middle earners would end up paying more in Scotland because of the SNP's policies?
And which earners in particular did he have in mind? Why, senior nurses, teachers and police officers.
More appealing perhaps than bankers and financiers - although undoubtedly there are warm, worthy accountants and insurance brokers who are absolute darlings.
Ms Sturgeon was having none of it. The SNP approach was fair and balanced, protecting services for the poor as far as possible while ensuring that the tax burden fell on the shoulders of those able to pay.
It was, overall, a good, robust exchange. A contest both ideological and pragmatic on the subject of how to distribute money and how best to stimulate the economy.
From Patrick Harvie of the Greens, an appeal to treat asylum seekers with empathy and practical support. Ms Sturgeon responded in kind.
And then, finally, an extensive discourse on a deeply serious subject, that of racism and anti-Semitism.
The first minister has just returned from a visit to Auschwitz which, understandably, influenced her perspective, if only to add historical context to her staunch denunciation of contemporary anti-Semitism.
The talk turned to party politics. Gently and with restraint, Labour's Neil Findlay mentioned a controversy affecting some in the West Lothian SNP over responses to an allegedly anti-Semitic online post.
With comparable restraint, Ms Sturgeon said she would make no comment on an internal disciplinary matter, other than to restate her condemnation of racism in all forms.
But she appealed to all parties and all politicians to treat such matters with sensitivity. Such controversies should not, she said, be ""weaponised"".
At that, they all nodded."
http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-38919038,asylum seeker,517,9 February 2017,None,Merkel seeks to ramp up failed asylum seeker deportations,"German Chancellor Angela Merkel is set to unveil plans to significantly increase deportations of failed asylum seekers.
The measures include allowing access to asylum seekers' phones and Sim cards to verify their identities and increasing the amount paid to voluntary returnees.
Migration has become a heavily politicised issue in Germany ahead of elections later this year.
An asylum seeker killed 12 people at a Berlin Christmas market in December.
The case of Anis Amri, who Tunisia refused to take back after his asylum bid was rejected, has increased pressure on Mrs Merkel's government.
The German chancellor is meeting with state leaders later to discuss a new 16-point plan to speed up deportations.
The plan, which was leaked to German media, says that a new deportation co-ordination centre will be set up in Berlin.
Exit centres could also be set up near airports to hold rejected asylum seekers in the days or weeks before they are deported.
The federal government plans to spend €90m (£76m) this year as part of repatriation and reintegration programmes. More money will be given to voluntary returnees who make their decision quickly.
Germany's 16 regional governments are responsible for deporting migrants whose applications for asylum have been rejected.
About 890,000 asylum seekers arrived in Germany in 2015. Mrs Merkel's decision to leave the borders open while other European states were closing theirs dented her popularity and led to the rise of anti-immigrant party Alternative for Germany (AfD).
But the main threat facing her Christian Democratic Union ahead of September's election are the Social Democrats, which have seen a surge in support since former EU Parliament president Martin Schulz was nominated to lead the party last month.
Some state governments led by the Social Democrats oppose the deportation of Afghans who have their asylum claims rejected on the basis that their home country is not safe to return to.
Afghans have become Germany's second largest group of asylum seekers, after Syrians, with 154,000 arriving in 2015. Nearly all Syrians receive asylum due to the ongoing civil war in their country.
About 25,000 migrants in total were deported last year, while more than double that left voluntarily.
More people were being granted asylum, but more were also being rejected, Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere said on Thursday.
""So we have to do more about repatriations and deportations too,"" he said.
55,000
left voluntarily in 2016
25,000
deported
37,220 left voluntarily in 2015
20,914 deported
Some charities that help asylum seekers have criticised the plans, arguing that wrong decisions are made in the asylum determination process.
But Eva Lohse, president of the Association of German Cities, said it was necessary to repatriate rejected asylum seekers ""in order to gain the acceptance by residents of those who really need protection from war and persecution"".
Some 207,000 migrants were facing deportation at the end of 2016, according to government statistics quoted by German press agency DPA.
That number could rise to 450,000 people by the end of this year ""if the process does not change"", Gerd Landsberg of the town and communities association told the Rheinische Post newspaper."

Public service provider Serco has said it is providing housing for 330 people ""at its own expense"".
Ms Nokes met the council leader on Tuesday to discuss the eviction process for those not given refugee status.
Serco has temporarily suspended plans to change the locks on properties after legal action and protests.
Housing charity Shelter Scotland has filed papers at Glasgow Sheriff Court to prevent two tenants being issued with so-called lock-change orders.
The issue is also due to be raised in the Court of Session in Edinburgh by Govan Law Centre, which wants to establish the legal principles involved.
Following the ""constructive"" meeting with the UK immigration minister, council leader Susan Aitken said: ""There is currently little clarity about the actual status of the 330 people affected, therefore it is essential that Glasgow City Council has the time and opportunity to carry out individual assessments for all of them and ensure that everyone gets the right support and outcome for their circumstances.
""The minister agreed this was necessary and her officers have committed to engaging constructively with us to ensure this is put in place.""
She added: ""Ms Nokes and her officials have been left in no doubt that lock changes and evictions are not good for anyone, and do not have support within the city.
""Whilst she was unable to give a guarantee that they would not continue, we have made significant progress.
""However, we will continue to join with partners across the city to campaign for this policy to be changed.""
The minister was due to meet Serco later, and hold talks with the Scottish government on Wednesday.
Serco is contracted to provide housing while applications are considered by the Home Office.
Last month, it said it planned to evict those tenants who had exhausted the asylum process.
Ms Aitken wrote to Home Secretary Sajid Javid warning that it risked a ""humanitarian crisis"", leaving those affected out on the streets.
Serco denied the claim and said it currently pays accommodation for 330 asylum seekers who no longer receive Home Office support.
About a third have been granted leave to remain while the remainder have been refused refugee status.
Serco's eviction plans affects the latter group, which the firm says has no right to remain in the UK.
Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard has written to Ruth Davidson, urging her to ""break her silence"" on the issue and put pressure on the government to halt the evictions.
In response, the Scottish Conservative leader said she met Serco chief executive Rupert Soames last week to discuss the eviction proposals.
She endorsed statements from leader of the Conservative group on Glasgow City Council, David Meikle, calling for clarity and a solution to the ""potential crisis"", and from Tory MSP Adam Tomkins.
Mr Tomkins said: ""If people whose applications have been rejected are housed indefinitely, that is manifestly unfair to others with genuine asylum claims.""
Ahead of the meeting with Ms Nokes on Wednesday, Aileen Campbell, cabinet secretary for communities and local government, said: ""An asylum system that sees people end up destitute and homeless in the country where they sought refuge lacks humanity, and the UK government must be open and accountable for its decisions and policy, which remain wholly reserved.
""I want to see changes that will deliver a fair, effective and compassionate system that treats everyone seeking asylum with respect while their legal rights are fully met.""
She added: ""The current situation in Glasgow is a human rights issue at which people across Scotland have quite rightly shown outrage.
""As such, I will press the UK government to fix their failing system by finding a long-term solution and ensure the current situation cannot happen again.
""This means the Home Office must ensure equity of funding for Glasgow City Council which is a dispersal area. It is unacceptable to deny funding that is available to English councils to a council which has welcomed asylum seekers and given them a home.""
The Home Office earlier said asylum seekers ""who would otherwise be destitute"" are provided with free accommodation while their applications are considered.
It added: ""While an asylum claim or an appeal is outstanding, we would not be seeking removal.
""If the courts have decided that someone has no right to remain in the United Kingdom it is right that they should leave the UK.
""However, if an asylum claim has failed, we will still provide accommodation for those who would otherwise be destitute and who are temporarily unable to leave the UK because of a practical or legal obstacle."""

The 17-year-old asylum seeker was arrested in the Uckermark region, north-east of Berlin, on Tuesday.
Police said that he was arrested after a tip-off that he had sent a message to his family saying farewell and that he was joining the ""jihad"".
But German media reports now suggest that the message was mistranslated.
The message was sent via WhatsApp in the past week and Brandenburg state authorities received the tip-off late on Monday from two other German states, a police spokesman told the Associated Press.
Police seized a number of mobile phones and a tablet for analysis.
""No concrete evidence was found that he was planning a crime that endangered the state,"" Reuters quoted prosecutors as saying.
There was also no evidence that he was linked to any foreign militant organisation, the news agency said.
The teenager, who was only named as ""Nidal"" by police, had been living in a home for unaccompanied underage refugees, and had never come to police attention before.
Brandenburg police said that at its peak, 130 officials were assigned to the investigation.
Germany has been on high alert since December, when a jihadist killed 12 people with a lorry in Berlin.
That attack on a Christmas market by Anis Amri, a Tunisian, put security services under intense scrutiny because of the way in which the attacker, who was later shot dead by police in Italy, evaded their surveillance and crossed European borders undetected.
In April, a 16-year-old Syrian refugee was convicted in western Germany for planning a bomb attack and sentenced to two years in a youth prison. The judges in Cologne said the plot was at a very early stage and did not yet pose any threat to the public.
Chancellor Angela Merkel recently moved to try and ramp up deportations of failed asylum seekers.
Some 280,000 asylum seekers arrived in Germany last year, a drop of more than 600,000 compared to 2015."

Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International released a report criticising conditions at a detention centre on the island of Nauru.
The report concluded that Australia must intentionally allow abuse of detainees to deter asylum seekers.
A statement from the Immigration Department criticised Amnesty for not consulting the government.
""There was no consultation with the Department of Immigration and Border Protection from Amnesty International in preparation of this report,"" the statement said.
""We strongly refute many of the allegations in the report and would encourage Amnesty International to contact the Department before airing allegations of this kind.""
The statement said Australia did not exert control over the laws of Nauru, a sovereign country. It said the Australian government welcomed independent scrutiny of its facilities.
Australia transports asylum seekers who arrive by boat to off-shore processing centres in Nauru and Papua New Guinea.
Read more: Why are asylum seekers so controversial in Australia?
The Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch report was written after an incognito visit to Nauru last month. The organisations said Australia's actions seemed designed to discourage other migrants from attempting to get to Australia.
No documentary evidence was provided in the report to support the claim.
But interviews with 84 refugees and asylum seekers unearthed claims of rape and assault at the hand of Nauruan locals, inadequate medical care and cramped, uncomfortable living conditions.
The detention centre at Nauru is run by a company called Broadspectrum and medical services are provided by International Health and Medical Services. Both companies have a contract with the Australian government.
One woman quoted in the report said she had married a man 15 years her senior in order to feel safe on the island. Another said Nauruan men had driven her into the jungle with the intent of raping her.
Although most held on the island have been identified as genuine refugees and released into the community, many felt afraid to leave their accommodations, particularly at night, the report said.
The report also alleged that Nauruan police tended to downplay or ignore asylum seekers' reports of abuse."

Asylum seekers will not be eligible to work with An Garda Síochána (Irish police), the Defence Forces or the civil service.
However, there will be no fees or income limits under the scheme or any restriction to temporary or permanent jobs.
Justice Minister Charlie Flanagan told Irish national broadcaster RTÉ that a 12-week transition period will apply in which asylum seekers will still be allowed access to welfare payments.

Contractor Serco faces pressure to halt a programme of changing locks to force people out of their Glasgow homes.
Six individuals were due to be issued notices on Monday, with up to 300 people at risk of eviction.
Glasgow City Council leader Susan Aitken has sent a ""strongly-worded"" letter to Sajid Javid, signed by politicians from several parties.
In it she ""calls on the Home Office to demand Serco ceases its lock change programme"".
It condemns the Home Office contractor's action as ""wholly unacceptable"".
And it warns Serco's actions will ""trigger a humanitarian crisis in Glasgow"" and create ""imminent risk of significant harm to a vulnerable group"".
The letter was signed by councillors Susan Aitken, Mhairi Hunter, Jennifer Layden (SNP); Martha Wardrop (Green); Frank McAveety (Labour); and MPs Alison Thewliss, Patrick Grady, David Linden, Carol Monaghan, Chris Stephens and Stewart McDonald (SNP) and Paul Sweeney (Labour).
Refugee groups and public sector organisations have condemned the moves since details broke over the weekend.
Many of the failed asylum seekers are housed in properties leased from housing associations by Serco.
The Scottish Federation of Housing Associations (SFHA) said it had concerns about the eviction policy.
Sally Thomas, chief executive of SFHA, said: ""Serco has been criticised in the past for poor practice in how it treats vulnerable tenants, and appeared to improve its policy and practice on how it interacts with asylum seekers who have had asylum claims refused.
""We are concerned now that Serco is in danger of putting profit before people, failing to work within the spirit of the law, and letting down vulnerable households in the support and inadequate time they need to make alternative housing arrangements.""
Serco has said it is sympathetic to the plight of the residents but says it has been covering the cost of housing the tenants after their applications have been refused.
The company said it had been working with the city council on the process for the last four months.
Serco's Jenni Halliday said: ""Serco has been providing housing free of charge to over 300 former asylum seekers who no longer have the right to stay in the UK.
""We have been paying for the rent, the rates, the heating and lighting, and insurance on their properties, in many cases for many months all at our own expense.
""Each of these former asylum seekers have been refused the right to stay in the UK by the Government and the Home Office does not fund Serco to provide them with accommodation.""
The Home Office provides free, fully-furnished accommodation to asylum seekers while applications are being considered.
A Home Office spokesman said: ""While an asylum claim is outstanding, we would not be seeking removal.
""Even if an asylum claim has failed, we will provide accommodation for those who would otherwise be destitute and who are temporarily unable to leave the UK because of a practical or legal obstacle.
""However, it is right that we prepare for someone's removal if they do not have a lawful basis to stay in the UK and they are not pursuing an appeal."""
http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-australia-38037070,asylum seeker,377,19 November 2016,None,Australia bank fire started by Myanmar asylum seeker,"An asylum seeker from Myanmar has been identified as the man who set himself alight in a bank in the Australian city of Melbourne on Friday.
The 21-year-old is under guard in hospital after the incident that injured 26 others.
He arrived by boat three years ago and had been released from detention pending a decision on his case.
It was reported that his benefits had not been in his account when he tried to withdraw them on Wednesday.
The man, known to his friends as Noor, set himself alight using gasoline at the Commonwealth Bank of Australia branch in the Melbourne suburb of Springvale.
Five bystanders suffered burns and 21 more smoke inhalation.
Video taken by eyewitnesses of the immediate aftermath showed flames inside the bank branch and thick black smoke, according to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.
The suspect had arrived in Australia as an unaccompanied minor and was awaiting receipt of a refugee visa.
The man was reportedly of mixed Muslim parentage. Although he is partly Rohingya - the Muslim community that lives in Rakhine state near the Bangladesh border and which has been denied citizenship and freedom of movement by the government - he reportedly lived in southern Myanmar.
He had been detained in a camp on Christmas Island in the Indian Ocean before being moved to Melbourne.
The president of the Australian Burmese Rohingya Organisation, Habib Habib, told the Melbourne Age: ""He has been suffering and his friends say his welfare payment was not received and he couldn't pay his rent.""
He had returned to the bank each day after finding his money was not available on Wednesday.
Mr Habib said: ""This system makes all of them crazy. They're in legal limbo.""
Refugee and asylum seeker advocate Pamela Curr told the Age the man was also was known to have mental health problems.
The department of immigration has set up a fast-track system to process about 30,000 asylum claims. Ms Curr said this had caused uncertainty in the community.
Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce expressed concern for those who were burned in the incident.
""There's nothing more disturbing than a burns ward. Maybe he had lost his mind - you'd have to lose your mind to do something so cruel,"" Mr Joyce said."
http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-44873228,asylum seeker,1618,20 July 2018,By Jordan Davies & Gwyneth Rees,Mustafa Dawood: Brother's questions after immigration raid death,"In June 2018, Mustafa Dawood died after falling through a factory roof while running away from immigration officers. It was a brutal end to a short life - one that had already seen him flee war in Sudan and make a perilous journey across Europe eventually settling in south Wales. So why did Mustafa die, and why are politicians and campaign groups now clamouring for justice?
It was early morning at the Shaftesbury Hand Car Wash in Newport and already a queue was forming.
Drivers eager to get back on the road stood around drinking coffee and chatting as a team of workers cleaned and jet-washed their vehicles.
But according to a witness, at half past nine, the banal scene came to an abrupt halt with the loud screech of tyres as a marked white van spun into the compound.
The Home Office said their immigration enforcement ""acted on intelligence"".
As it came to a stop, the doors were flung open and a team of immigration officers emerged. The car wash staff scattered in all directions.
One of them was Mustafa Dawood, working illegally while awaiting a decision on his asylum application.
Panicked, he dropped his tools and ran.
Scrambling up a ladder, he climbed on to the roof of a neighbouring factory.
Seconds later, a loud crash and Mustafa fell.
He plummeted 40ft or so to the ground beneath.
The Home Office said they then promptly suspended their operation.
Horrified onlookers watched while immigration officers made frantic attempts to save him.
He was rushed by ambulance to Cardiff's University Hospital of Wales.
But it was to no avail.
This was Saturday, 30 June 2018. And at the age of 23, Mustafa was dead.
It was a life that ended roughly 3,000 miles (4,800km) away from his birth place in Al-Fashir, a small city and the capital of the North Darfur state in Sudan.
A dry, dusty place, and one without many opportunities compared with the Western world, still it provided a happy home for Mustafa's childhood.
Brought up by his parents, the middle of six children - four brothers and two sisters - from a young age he worked with his father, helping out in his shop and riding in the back of his lorry.
But his main passion was football, leading to the nickname Casillas after a Real Madrid goalkeeper.
His brother Ahmed Dawood said: ""Mustafa liked to play soccer, and he had a lot of friends.
""If you see his Facebook page, he has a thousand or more friends.
""He was a happy child, full of happiness. And he was loved by everybody.""
But in February 2003, war came to Darfur, with the Sudan Liberation Army and Justice Equality Movement fighting the government, which they accused of oppressing the black African, non-Arab population.
The government began a campaign of ethnic cleansing against Darfur's non-Arabs, including those of the Zaghawa tribe, to which Mustafa's family belonged.
Ahmed said: ""Everyone left.
""People tried to come to Europe. A lot of people came.
""Mustafa left because of the war. He wasn't happy, his future wasn't there.
""He was looking for a safe place, he was looking for his future.""
Ahmed himself left Darfur in 2011, but it took Mustafa a few years to follow, setting out as a teenager.
It is believed he made the difficult journey north to Egypt, then across the perilous Mediterranean Sea to Italy, France, then through Calais to the UK.
Arriving in early 2015, he claimed asylum and set about beginning his new life in Southampton where his cousin Abdalaziz Osman already lived.
Abdalaziz had been granted asylum in 2001, and had subsequently set up a security firm employing more than 100 people.
He said: ""Mustafa wasn't allowed to work, but friends gave him money.
""He was such a friendly, likeable man, willing to live and learn.
""He improved his English. He never drank, never smoked, never went to nightclubs.
""He was a very special guy. I have never seen a young adult like that.""
Despite his family members already being granted asylum, Mustafa's case was not straightforward.
The Home Office did not believe he was from the Zaghawa tribe and his asylum application was rejected.
Abdalaziz said: ""When his case was rejected, I went to court. I attended as a witness with another three people from the community.
""We told them he is from Sudan and our community and tribe.""
Still Mustafa's case was rejected.
Abdalaziz added: ""We went to another solicitor and waited to get access to an expert to prove he was from Darfur.
""Mustafa waited almost two years for this expert to write a report, and still the Home Office rejected it.
""The expert wrote to the Home Office telling them they were wrong and asking them to look again at their position.
""The Home Office was still considering his case. They put it on hold and had not made a final decision. Then he died.""
Mustafa was worried about how long the application process was taking, his family say.
Abdalaziz said: ""I always said to him, 'calm down, don't worry about waiting'.
""People who try to come to the UK often spend 10, 15 years.
""His mum told me to look after him. She told me young guys do silly things.""
Six months before his death, Mustafa was moved to the Allt-Yr-Yn suburb of Newport, where he was given a room in a shared house run by a private firm for the Home Office.
He was living there while his final application was considered.
Like the roughly 500 other asylum seekers in Newport, he waited.
But he also made friends with people at a local charity, The Sanctuary, which supports local migrants.
There he helped translate for other asylum applicants and worked on the centre's allotment, digging vegetables in his distinctive white trousers.
Project manager Sarah Croft said: ""We had only known Mustafa for six months, but he made a lasting impression on us. He was just the nicest, nicest young man.
""So helpful, so respectful, always positive. He integrated with all cultures and was willing to help anyone. He is very sorely missed at the moment. We're heartbroken.""
Still, neither Mustafa's cousin, brother nor friends, had any idea he was working illegally.
Abdalaziz said: ""I always asked if he had money.
""He said he had money but he didn't tell me he was working.
""He was willing to help people. The last word he spoke to his mum was on the Friday and he asked her if she had a microwave or not.
""He was going to try and send the money. He tried to help her.""
Abdalaziz said: ""On the Saturday, I rang and rang him but his phone was off.
""I wanted to book a ticket for him to attend my graduation.
""On Sunday, I sent another Zaghawa person to see him because we are so many here.
""He went to his house but his room was locked. But on the Monday morning, he found out from a housemate.""
The Independent Office for Police Conduct has opened an investigation, saying that during the early stage there was ""no indication that anyone serving with Immigration Enforcement may have breached the standards of professional behaviour"".
The Home Office will not comment on the immigration status of Mustafa or whether any criminal proceedings will be launched against the car wash.
But they did say their immigration enforcement ""acted on intelligence"" and attended Shaftesbury Hand Car Wash.
""During the course of the operation a 23-year-old Sudanese man fell from height and the operation was suspended,"" said a Home Office spokesperson.
""Officers at the scene performed CPR until paramedics arrived. The man was transferred by ambulance to hospital, where he later died. Our thoughts are with his family.
""As is the case with any death during the course of a law enforcement operation, the police have been informed and the matter referred to the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) which is investigating.
""It would be inappropriate to comment while this investigation is ongoing.""
A coroner has said an inquest will be opened ""at some point"" in the future.
But politicians and campaign groups have reacted angrily.
On 9 July, around 60 people attended the Justice for Mustafa protest, organised by detainee support group SDS outside the Home Office in London.
Bethan Sayed, Plaid Cymru Assembly member for South West Wales, said: ""I think it's appalling that someone died in this way.
""Obviously, asylum seekers are not allowed to work, but if officers knew he was working, they could have approached this in an entirely more humane way.
""I know refugees in the Swansea area and some of them are waiting six, seven years for the Home Office to make a decision.""
Eyewitness Lyndon Saunders, 70, from Newport, who was waiting for his van to be cleaned, too has a view.
He said: ""If it had been handled differently, maybe he'd still be alive. It was very heavy-handed and dramatic, like something from Starsky & Hutch.
""I feel so, so sorry for the boy and his family.""
The owner of Shaftesbury Hand Car Wash in Newport has refused to comment and the business remains open.
Now it is left to Mustafa's friends and family to rebuild their lives without him.
Yet they too are angry.
Abdalaziz said: ""It's unbelievable.
""If this was Sudan, you would expect this to happen, but not here.""
Ahmed added: ""When everyone was told he was dead, no one believed it.
""Everyone cried. My mother is still crying.
""It's very hard to have the loss of a young brother - only 23. I feel so sad.
""I have a lot of questions.
""Something wrong [has] happened."""
http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-37862039,asylum seeker,638,4 November 2016,None,Child asylum seeker numbers 'double in two years',"Numbers of unaccompanied asylum-seeking children cared for by councils in England more than doubled in the two years to March, says a report.
Numbers hit 4,210 and are still rising following the closure of the Calais Jungle camp, says the Association of Directors of Children's Services.
Almost 300 arrived in the last two weeks of October alone, says the ADCS.
But a national shortage of foster carers means councils are struggling to care for the children, says the report.
Information from more than 100 local authorities revealed that more than a third of the children were suffering psychological symptoms like post-traumatic stress disorder, flashbacks and depression.
Many have complex health problems and none has any kind of vaccination history.
Costs to local authorities for every 100 unaccompanied children are estimated at £6.75m a year, with the Home Office providing £3.35m, leaving a shortfall of £3.4m, says the report.
And 76% of the councils that responded said they were struggling to find foster placements for the children.
An extra 7,600 foster carers are already needed in England, according to a Fostering Network report from earlier this year, and ADCS president Dave Hill fears the pressure can only worsen.
""This figure is now much greater as we prepare for the arrival of more unaccompanied children and young people in the coming weeks.
""This crisis is driving up the usage of independent fostering agencies out of necessity and this in turn is driving up costs and draining already stretched council budgets,"" said Mr Hill.
The report says that the market for foster carers is becoming ""febrile"" as local authorities compete for placements.
""Now more than ever there needs to be a concerted effort from central and local government working together to increase the number of affordable short and long term foster placements,"" say the authors.
Government plans to bring 3,000 refugees, mostly vulnerable children at risk, from the Middle East and Africa to the UK as well as 20,000 Syrian refugee families could place councils under even more pressure, says the report.
And it is ""not possible to forecast the number of children who will continue to arrive through clandestine routes and the 'lorry stop lottery',"" it adds.
So far, a small number of ""port"" authorities have carried a disproportionate burden, say the authors.
Since July, a dispersal scheme has meant other local authorities have begun to take a share of the children.
The ADCS estimates that if each authority took in 0.07% of its child population that would equate to 8,114 unaccompanied asylum-seeking children - but the association says it is not clear when that ""ceiling"" will be met.
Most of the children come from conflict zones like Afghanistan, Eritrea, Iraq and Syria; 76% are aged 16 and 17 and more than 90% are male, says the report.
David Simmonds, chairman of the Local Government Association's Asylum Migration and Refugee Task Group, said the report ""highlights the significant financial commitment that councils make towards the care of these vulnerable children, with Home Office funding often covering only a small part of the overall cost"".
It was now ""imperative"" that councils had a long-term funding arrangement from government, he added.
A government spokeswoman said there was no evidence of a national shortage of foster carers, ""but we always want to encourage more people to take on [the] role"".
The spokeswoman said many people had come forward following recent media coverage of children caught up in the migration crisis, offering to foster child asylum seekers or refugees.
""The recently announced safeguarding strategy for unaccompanied and asylum-seeking and refugee children will set out plans to increase the number of foster carers, and bolster supported lodging provision.
""We are grateful for the ongoing support of local authorities who care for unaccompanied asylum-seeking children and have substantially increased the amount of funding we provide them."""
http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-44743483,asylum seeker,476,6 July 2018,None,Trudeau spars with Ontario leader over asylum seekers,"A surge of asylum seekers from the US has caused strife between Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and the leader of the most populous province.
Ontario Premier Doug Ford says the province will not pay for the cost of housing the thousands of asylum seekers spilling over the US border.
Mr Trudeau fired back that he had to ""explain"" how Canada's refugee system works to the newly elected Mr Ford.
Since January, almost 9,500 asylum seekers have been caught at the border.
Mr Trudeau said he had to spend ""a little time explaining"" how the asylum-seeking system works in his first meeting with Mr Ford since the premier was elected in June.
""The premier asked me a question that a lot of people have asked me: 'Why don't we just stop them at the border? Why don't we just prevent them from crossing?'"" Mr Trudeau told CBC Metro Morning on Friday, the day after his meeting.
""We have to provide due process for people according with Canadian law and values.""
Mr Ford blamed the federal government's immigration policies on the influx, and said that Ottawa should pay ""100%"" of the costs associated with housing and providing services to the asylum seekers while they stay in Canada and wait for their refugee claims to be heard.
His thoughts were echoed by others in his party, the Ontario Progressive Conservatives.
""[Trudeau] was the one who tweeted out that everyone was welcome here and as a result of that we've had thousands of people cross the border illegally and it's putting a strain on many of our public resources,"" said Lisa MacLeod, Ontario's minister of children, community and social services.
Since Donald Trump was elected, almost 30,000 migrants trying to illegally cross the border have been apprehended by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP). Many migrants had tried and failed to get asylum in the US.
Once in Canadian police custody, migrants are allowed to make their refugee claim.
Canadian provinces and cities have scrambled to provide services for this surge of migrants, especially in Quebec, where most border crossings occur.
Montreal had to open its Olympic Stadium as a shelter to house the migrants. Now many are being moved to Ontario - especially to the city of Toronto.
In June, Toronto Mayor John Tory sent a letter urging the federal government for more support.
The letter claimed that there were more than 3,000 refugee claimants and asylum seekers living in shelters and hotels.
The mayor said soon the city may have to turn community centres into additional residences, which would cut back on services for its own citizens.
The federal government has already earmarked C$11m ($8.4m; £6.3m) to help Ontario with housing asylum seekers, but Mr Tory said he needs more like C$64m.
After Mr Ford's statements, Mr Trudeau responded that more help will be on the way."
http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/blogs-news-from-elsewhere-36478410,asylum seeker,249,8 June 2016,By News from Elsewhere...,None,"Plans are under way in Denmark for a football league for asylum seekers, aimed at helping them to integrate into society.
Residents at four centres for asylum seekers in eastern Denmark will compete against each other in the pilot project, which is due to kick-off in August, the TV2 website reports.
It is the idea of Per Bjerregaard, former chairman of the top-flight Danish club Brondby IF. ""The project can contribute in a variety of ways,"" he tells the broadcaster.
""Asylum seekers can get exercise and variety in their daily lives, and get easier access to other Danes and associations in Denmark. In this way we can facilitate integration through football.""
The participants are being kitted out with football boots and strips, and Mr Bjerregaard says a number of big names have agreed to help with coaching the players. Among them are former Danish national team manager Morten Olsen and ex-Celtic midfielder Morten Wieghorst.
The Red Cross, European football's governing body UEFA, and the Danish football association are also backing the project.
Kasper Koch from the Red Cross says football takes people's minds off their other worries and can help them to form personal networks, a key tool in finding employment.
Mr Koch hopes the league could go nationwide - or perhaps even further, telling TV2: ""Who knows - maybe it could have the same structure as the Champions League.""

Elizabeth Aruoriwo Obueza, 48, was detained two weeks ago after the government dismissed her appeal to stay in Japan for protection against religious persecution.
But a rights group says she is being held on her own because she is an activist for asylum seekers.
Japan rejected 99% of asylum requests last year, accepting just 27 refugees.
The Nigerian, an evangelical Christian, says she fled from Nigeria to Japan in 1991 to escape female genital mutilation and applied for asylum in 2011.
Her arrest comes as the justice ministry is trying to reduce the number of foreigners living in Japan without visas, currently about 60,000.
But her lawyer told the BBC she was being particularly targeted by the authorities because she petitioned the Japanese government for better conditions for asylum seekers.
How bad is solitary confinement?
What's it like to spend decades in solitary confinement?
How solitary broke a man named Badness
Ms Obueza says she has spent 22 hours a day alone in a small cell since being detained.
""Elizabeth is held in solitary because she's an activist and immigration officials don't want her causing trouble,"" said Mitsuru Miyasako, head of the Provisional Release Association in Japan, a group representing refugees and immigrants.
""Locking someone up alone in a tiny room is to ruin them psychologically.""
The Japanese authorities did not comment.
Ms Obueza had campaigned for asylum seekers and people on ""provisional release"", a status that allows migrants to live outside a detention facility but barring them from working or travelling freely.
People on provisional release are being specifically targeted by the authorities, activists and lawyers say.
She has also spent the last 10 years helping asylum seekers navigate the immigration system and has previously been detained for 10 months.
""I want to help people. Give me the right to help people - don't put me in here,"" Ms Obueza told Reuters news agency.
The crackdown on asylum seekers comes as Japan faces a impending labour shortage due to its the ageing population."
http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-36433066,asylum seeker,419,2 June 2016,None,Germany: CDU councillor 'tied asylum-seeker up',"German media say a councillor for Angela Merkel's Christian Democrats (CDU) was one of a group of men who tied an Iraqi asylum-seeker to a tree.
It happened after the asylum-seeker argued with staff in a supermarket in the town of Arnsdorf, near Dresden.
Detlef Oelsner told local media (in German) that he would still have done it if the man were German.
He said: ""We showed civil courage and would have done the same no matter who was involved.""
He stopped short of confirming he tied the man to the tree, but his involvement was reported by German media.
The incident happened on 21 May but came to light this week when a video was circulated online showing the 21-year-old man, an inpatient at a psychiatric hospital, lifting a wine bottle off a shelf during an argument with a supermarket worker.
He did not hurt anybody.
Germans uneasy with migrant influx
The video then shows a group of men surrounding and forcibly dragging the Iraqi man from the shop. Police say the man was later found tied to a tree.
When police arrived, the men told them they had done it to stop the asylum-seeker from running away.
He was treated by paramedics before being returned to the psychiatric hospital.
Police are investigating the men involved on suspicion of false imprisonment, and the asylum-seeker on suspicion of intimidation. They have asked for witnesses to the incident to come forward.
Police did not name anyone involved but the German press have named Mr Oelsner, who ran for mayor in Arnsdorf last year. He told Die Zeit (in German) that he lived next door to the supermarket and heard the incident over the garden fence before going in, helping subdue the Iraqi man and calling the police.
The video has mostly been circulated on anti-refugee websites, with some people calling the men a ""citizens' army"".
Dresden, 24km (15 miles) west of Arnsdorf, is where the anti-Islam Pegida movement is based. Refugees have been a controversial political issue since Germany took in more than a million people fleeing conflict in Syria and other countries.
Police figures showed a five-fold jump in attacks on migrants in Germany in 2015, compared with the year before.
After being asked on Facebook about the incident, the supermarket chain Netto said the workers in the shop did not call the group of men in.
Netto said it ""goes without saying that customers will be treated the same, independently of their ethnic origin, religion, gender or age""."
http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-37518709,asylum seeker,626,30 September 2016,None,Former asylum seeker tennis player wins Black History award,"A former asylum seeker who was coached by her father has won a sport award as part of Black History Month.
Kimberly Mpukusa, 18, became the number one Welsh under 18s tennis player despite struggling to find a sponsor.
Contributions made by black people to history and culture will be celebrated throughout October.
The event's first youth awards, Young Gifted and Black, for people aged between 13 and 30, took place in Cardiff on Thursday.
Ms Mpukusa, from Swansea, started playing tennis aged nine on a school trip, and her dad picked up the sport and read books in order to help her. She struggled to compete in tournaments due to her financial situation.
She stopped playing at age 13 because of her asylum case, but returned to the sport two years ago when her family was granted an indefinite stay.
She started that year as the 123rd best player and has now returned to the number-one spot.
Ms Mpukusa : ""It really means a lot to me, words can't explain how much my parents have struggled and how much that I've struggled.
""This award, I can show people that if you work hard, if you're determined, if you sacrifice, you can become big and people can recognise how hard you work.""
Ify Iwobi from Swansea battled obsessive compulsive disorder, (OCD) to win the music award.
She said: ""When I was young, especially when I was a baby, I used to tinker up to the toy pianos that we had in the house and I used to just experiment with the keys and just tap along and make different sounds with my baby hands.
""My friends were like 'she's drawn to the piano, there's something that she's drawn to with the piano so we need to get this talent honed'. So when I was a bit older, from six, I started classical piano lessons.
""It hasn't been easy expressing my music especially, with the OCD... that includes disturbing thoughts, memories from the past which weren't that pleasant, basically they would disrupt what goes on from day-to-day living.
""That would get in the way of me and my personal practice on the piano, waste a lot of time and energy.
""I had to have lots of therapy, I had to go to lots of counselling and they gave me ways to think positively.""
Roselynn Mbwembwe, 15, a dancer from Swansea, won the award for the performing arts. She has been dancing since she was eight-years-old and had won over 25 awards in dance, including Welsh dancer of the year.
She said the award is not just for her ""but for other children like me too"".
Christopher Nation, 19, from Fairwater in Cardiff, picked up the young carer award. His family is originally from Jamaica and he has been looking after his mother since he was six.
""It's important for us to know our history. It's easy for us to get caught up in the way that the west is and forget about our own culture and things like that,"" he said.
More than 100 people attended the event in the Senedd.
The origins of Black History Month go back to 1926 in America, and there are now more than 6,000 events across the UK.
Ray Singh, chairman of Race Council Cymru who judged the awards, said: ""These young people have so much to offer our society and many have already made some rich contributions as carers, community leaders, musicians and volunteers.
""Their impact is already visible in the fields of science and innovation, citizenship and performing arts.
""Now, post-Brexit, it is about looking forward and ensuring that Wales is a nation where black history, arts and cultural differences can be the subject of celebration and not division."""
http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-manchester-35870216,asylum seeker,702,22 March 2016,None,Manchester asylum seeker hotel use investigated,"A hotel could be breaking planning laws by increasing the number of asylum seekers staying there, Manchester city council has said.
Britannia Airport Hotel - near Manchester Airport - has agreed with the Home Office sub-contractor Serco to accommodate about 300 people.
The council said failing to notify the authority of ""a change of use"" was ""completely unacceptable"".
Britannia Hotel Group is yet to comment.
The Home Office would not confirm how many asylum seekers were staying at the hotel in Northenden but Mike Kane, MP for Wythenshawe and Sale East, said 300 asylum seekers were being housed there.
Councillor Paul Andrews, executive member for health and wellbeing in Manchester, said: ""We do not believe hotels are the appropriate place for asylum seekers to be placed.
""We believe there may be a change of nature at the Britannia Airport hotel- a change from hotel to hostel. I have asked planning officers to look at what is going on.
""We have also made it clear to Serco that failing to notify the council in advance of this action having been taken is completely unacceptable.""
Manchester City Council has had no direct responsibility for providing accommodation and support to asylum seekers living within communities since 2012, Councillor Andrews added.
The Home Affairs Committee recently warned there was an ""impending shortage"" of housing for asylum seekers in the UK, including in Manchester and Rochdale.
Serco said several hotels, including the 212-room Britannia Airport Hotel, were being used to accommodate asylum seekers.
Jenni Halliday, from Serco said: ""The availability of individual hotels changes, sometimes at very short notice and when that happens we work hard to make sure that we can make alternative arrangements to safely accommodate the asylum seekers and keep the local authorities informed.""
I spoke to a small group of the asylum seekers staying at the Britannia Hotel. Two were from Syria and two others were from Iraq. They did not speak English that well but they did manage to tell me they were hoping to claim asylum here in the UK.
I had been at the hotel for about five minutes and a woman came over who told me she was from the Home Office and she demanded to know what I was doing there.
I explained I wanted to speak to the asylum seekers about what life was like back in their home countries, how they had made the journey to the UK and how they were being treated now they were living in Manchester.
The woman told me that even though I was in a public place I could not speak to any of the asylum seekers and if I wanted to speak to refugees I should go to Calais instead. She was being fairly aggressive at this point so I left and the asylum seekers were ushered into the hotel.
MP Mike Kane said some constituents had expressed concern about pressure on local services.
He said: ""There is no statutory underpinning from government or Serco to inform the local authority or local MP about this and these things become subject to rumour and conjecture; but as we found out in this case the rumour was accurate.""
One local resident said: ""It must be an immense cost. A friend of mine comes over from Ireland on a regular basis and has the same room [in the hotel] and it has gone up in price as there are fewer rooms available.""
A woman added: ""I think it is a good thing and diversity is always a good thing and if you can help somebody else who is less well off than you, you should do it. A lot of poorer countries have been taking in people and our country has a duty to help anyone else.""
A local man added: ""I feel sorry for them and all that but they should go to the first country they come to. They have come through about five countries to come here.""
The Home Office said the UK had a proud history of granting asylum to those who needed it.
A spokesperson added: ""We have made clear to our providers that the use of hotels is only ever acceptable as a short-term contingency measure."""

Australia transports asylum seekers who arrive by boat to off-shore processing centres in Nauru and Papua New Guinea.
Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International conducted extensive interviews on Nauru and said Australia had condoned severe abuse there.
Australia's government said it was not given a chance to address the claims.
In a report written after an incognito visit to Nauru last month, the organisations said Australia's actions seemed designed to discourage other migrants from attempting to get to Australia.
Interviews with 84 refugees and asylum seekers unearthed claims of rape and assault at the hand of Nauruan locals, inadequate medical care and cramped, uncomfortable living conditions.
The detention centre at Nauru is run by a company called Broadspectrum and medical services are provided by International Health and Medical Services. Both companies have a contract with the Australian government.
One woman quoted in the report said she had married a man 15 years her senior in order to feel safe on the island. Another said Nauruan men had driven her into the jungle with the intent of raping her.
Although most held on the island have been identified as genuine refugees and released into the community, many felt afraid to leave their accommodations, particularly at night, the report said.
The report also alleged that Nauruan police tended to downplay or ignore asylum seekers' reports of abuse.
It said prolonged detention in poor living conditions was causing both adults and children to experience severe anxiety, depression and suicidal thoughts.
""The Australian government's persistent failure to address abuses committed under its authority on Nauru strongly suggests that they are adopted or condoned as a matter of policy,"" it said.
No documentary evidence backing up the assertion of a deliberate government policy was provided in the report.
The rights groups said Nauru had colluded in the abuse because Australia paid it large sums to house the camp.
A spokesperson for Australia's Immigration Department said it had not been shown the claims in advance and encouraged the report's authors to speak to the government before airing such allegations.
Nauru's government has been contacted for comment."

German Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere said the man, who has not been officially named, had applied for asylum in August 2014. Using his fingerprints, officials found that he had already been registered as an asylum seeker in Bulgaria and later in Austria, he said.
He said Bulgaria had told German authorities that the 27 year old had been granted protection as a refugee there - as a result his application for asylum in Germany was refused on 2 December 2014 and his deportation to Bulgaria was ordered.
However, after medical certificates showed the man's ""psychological instability"", the deportation order was temporarily lifted, the interior minister said. But on 13 July it was re-issued.
That was just 11 days before the attacker struck, injuring 15 other people when he exploded his device on Sunday night, close to a square where a music festival was under way.
Police say he set off the bomb in his backpack after being kept from entering the festival ground because he did not have a ticket.
He had tried to kill himself twice in the past and had spent time in a psychiatric clinic, officials said.
Investigators announced on Monday they had found a video message on the bomber's phone in which he pledged allegiance to the leader of IS, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.
In the message, he threatened an ""act of revenge against Germans because they were standing in the way of Islam"", Bavarian state interior minister Joachim Herrmann told reporters.
Violent, militant Islamist videos and bomb-making materials including petrol and chemicals were found in his lodgings.
An Iranian neighbour at the former hotel, Alireza Khodadadi, told reporters he had occasionally drunk coffee with the Syrian, whom he named only as Mohammed, and they had discussed religion.
Mohammed, he said, had told him IS was not representative of Islam and he would say, ""No, I'm not with them, I don't like them.""
""He would always ask me if people in Iran were Shi'ite [Shia Muslim] or Sunni [Muslim],'"" Mr Khodadadi said.
At the same time, the Iranian recalled a man who would ""tell lies so often without any reason"", just to gain attention.
""Mohammed"" had been known to local police because of a drug-related offence.
A social worker who knew him, Reinhold Eschenbacher, recalled him as ""friendly, inconspicuous and nice"", Germany's DPA news agency reports.

135,852 more Syrians arrived in the first five months of 2016
Germany has been the main destination of Syrian asylum seekers entering the EU, most of them arriving irregularly in Greece via Turkey.
Only 23 Syrians had their applications for asylum rejected by the country last year, out of a total of 105,620 decisions on Syrians' applications. A common reason for rejecting an application is when the asylum seeker submits false or incomplete information.
Just under half of asylum seekers rejected by Germany in the past two years were allowed to stay on in the country, according to a recent report in German daily Die Welt (in German).
The Ansbach bomber, who was among those rejected for asylum in 2015, appears to have been placed in a former hotel in the town, designated by the municipal authorities for asylum seekers since 2014.

The 27-year-old man, who faced deportation to Bulgaria, detonated the device after being refused entry to the music festival, Bavarian officials say.
About 2,500 people were evacuated from the venue after the explosion.
It is the third violent attack in Bavaria in a week. The state's premier described it as ""days of horror"".
Bavaria has been on edge since a knife attack on a train last week that so-called Islamic State (IS) said it was behind.
On Friday a gun attack killed nine in Munich.
The Ansbach blast took place at 22:10 (20:10 GMT) on Sunday evening, outside the Eugens Weinstube bar in the centre of the town, which has a population of 40,000 and is home to a US military base.
The bomb went off close to the entrance to the Ansbach Open music festival.
A witness, Thomas Debinski, reported ""panic"" after the explosion, although some people had thought it was caused by a gas explosion.
""Then people came past and said it was a rucksack that had exploded,"" he told Sky News.
The town's mayor, Carla Seidel, confirmed that there were 15 injured, four of them in a serious condition.
Security services have sealed off the city centre and experts are trying to establish the kind of explosives the bomber used.

A week of bloody attacks has frayed nerves in Germany, which led the way in accepting asylum seekers from Syria. To date, only the first has been linked to a militant group:
German media on the attacks
The Syrian man entered Germany two years ago and had his asylum claim rejected a year ago, Bavarian Interior Minister Joachim Herrmann said.
He had been given leave to stay temporarily given the situation in his home country and provided with accommodation in Ansbach, Mr Herrmann added.
A federal interior ministry spokesman, Tobias Plate, confirmed the man had faced deportation to Bulgaria.
""Syrians cannot at the moment be deported to Syria, but that doesn't mean that Syrians overall cannot be deported,"" he told reporters in Berlin.
Mr Herrmann said he was ""incensed"" by the attack which, he continued, demonstrated the need to ""strengthen controls on those we have living in our country"".

Ansbach deputy police chief Roman Fertinger said there were ""indications"" that pieces of metal had been added to the explosive device.

Mr Herrmann said the man had been known to have tried to take his own life twice and had spent time in a psychiatric clinic.
""We don't know if this man planned on suicide or if he had the intention of killing others,"" he said.
A resident of the former Ansbach hotel where the bomber had lived, Alireza Khodadadi, told the Associated Press news agency that he had occasionally drunk coffee with the Syrian, whom he named only as Mohammed, and they had discussed religion.
Mohammed, he said, told him IS was not representative of Islam: ""He always said that, 'No, I'm not with them, I don't like them and such stuff.'

A row erupted last month over claims easily identifiable doors made refugees targets for racism and vandalism.
Contractor Jomast used the same standard paint on a number of properties, the review found.
Home Office Minister James Brokenshire said what happened to the refugees was ""inadvertent"" but should be avoided.
""Housing providers should ensure that, clearly, properties used to accommodate asylum seekers cannot be easily identified either as a deliberate policy or inadvertently,"" he said.
""The clear issue on being able to distinguish is not right, is not appropriate.""
Last month asylum seekers in Middlesbrough told The Times eggs and stones had been thrown at their houses because the doors made them easy to identify.
Mohammed Bagher Bayzavi, 58, said he asked for a different-coloured front door after being plagued by disturbances.
""Everyone here knows the red colour is Jomast. Change the colour - anything but red,"" he said.
The government launched an investigation into the homes, owned by Jomast, a subcontractor of services giant G4S.
Jomast boss Stuart Monk said at the time that the properties had not been deliberately painted red to mark out asylum seekers, describing the idea ""ludicrous"".
Work began to repaint the doors last month.
Giving an update to MPs, Mr Brokenshire said the use of a ""predominant colour"" was down to simple maintenance management, not design.
Inquiries to police revealed no reports of links to anti-social behaviour or stigmatisation, he said."

The plan was to convert Earnley Concourse - a former residential site for students in the village of Earnley.
Owners Stone Harbour had submitted a planning application seeking to temporarily house male adults awaiting the process of their asylum claims.
Residents voiced their opposition at a meeting of Earnley Parish Council, and the application has now been withdrawn.
Keith Martin, chairman of the parish council, said: ""It was the opinion of Earnley Parish Council and the great majority of our residents that the small rural parish of Earnley was always an inappropriate location for a hostel for asylum seekers.

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/stories-45976946,asylum seeker,2802,29 October 2018,By Jon Kelly,‘The SOS in my Halloween decorations’,"Inside a notorious Chinese labour camp, a dissident smuggled an SOS letter into the Halloween decorations he was forced to manufacture. Years later, a woman in the US opened a box of fake tombstones and found his note. It seemed impossible at that moment that they would ever meet.
A few years ago, as the evenings began getting colder and darker, Julie Keith remembered the graveyard kit in her loft.
She'd picked it up for $29.99 from the supermarket chain, Kmart, a couple of years before that. It contained polystyrene headstones, fake skulls and bones, black spiders and a cloth drenched in imitation blood.
It had been gathering dust in the loft ever since. But when her daughter told her she wanted a Halloween-themed fifth birthday party, Julie, then 42, thought of the kit and went upstairs to fetch it.
Then, as she opened the box in her living room, a sheet of lined paper fell out.
On it was a message, neatly hand-written in blue ink. Julie's daughter picked it up and asked her to read it. The English was broken and frequently mis-spelt, but its meaning was clear enough.
""Sir,"" it began. ""If you occassionally buy this product, please kindly send this letter to the World Human Right Organization. Thousands people here who are under the persicution of the Chinese Communist Party Government will thank and remember you forever.""
Julie read on. The note said that the graveyard kit had been produced in unit eight, department two of Masanjia labour camp in Shenyang, China. Inmates there had to work there for 15 hours a day seven days a week: ""Otherwise, they will suffer torturement, beat and rude remark. Nearly no payment (10 yuan/1 month)."" Today 10 yuan is roughly equivalent to £1.10 or US$1.44.
Prisoners were detained on average for one to three years without a formal court sentence, the note continued. Some of them belonged to the spiritual movement Falun Gong. ""They often suffer more punishment than others,"" the note said.
There was no signature at the end.
""I was kind of in shock,"" Julie says. ""I just couldn't believe that something like that was here, in front of me.""
It seemed miraculous that this scrap of paper had travelled thousands of miles to her home in Damascus, near Portland, in the US state of Oregon, and then languished in her home for two years until 2012. She tried to imagine how desperate its author must have felt, how much courage it must have taken to slip it in among the decorations.
Julie, a manager at the Goodwill thrift store chain, knew nothing at all about this person, but it was obvious to her that he or she desperately wanted the world to know what was happening at Masanjia.
Julie Keith and Leon Lee were speaking to Outlook on the BBC World Service

Julie didn't know where to begin, so she logged on to Facebook and asked for advice.
She took a photo of the note and posted it for her friends to see. They suggested that she contact human rights organisations, so Julie rang up and left messages with several - but she never received a reply.
Still, Julie didn't give up. She took the letter into work and showed it to her company's PR manager, who contacted a journalist on The Oregonian, a local newspaper. The paper sent an intern to interview Julie - but for a couple of months, once again, there was silence.
Then suddenly, just before Christmas 2012, the story finally ran. It was on The Oregonian's front page, and immediately Julie's phone started ringing.
TV networks and newspapers from around the world were asking her to speak - she found herself at the centre of a major international story.
Julie was delighted at first. She'd helped to spread the word about conditions in Masanjia, just as the note's author had asked. But then she read the comments below the online news reports.
Many strongly criticised her. By releasing the note in full - with its reference to the exact unit and department of the labour camp in which the author was held - she'd made a serious error, these commenters said. Surely now the whistleblower would be identified by the authorities and singled out for extra punishment?
""It crushed me,"" Julie says.
""I felt like, at that point, I maybe had done the wrong thing. I felt terrible but I just kept referring back to the letter - this is what the writer wanted. He wanted me to publicise this.""
The self-doubt kept nagging at Julie, however. But then, in mid-2013, she was contacted by the New York Times. The author of the note slipped in among the Halloween tombstones and skulls had been tracked down. And he had a message for her.
Five years earlier, Sun Yi looked out of a window into the darkness as he ate his meagre dinner at Masanjia prison camp, and saw a group of people moving through the gloom outside. He couldn't see well, but they appeared to be carrying human skulls and thigh bones.
Sun Yi was horrified. He'd only recently been sentenced but already he'd heard rumours that some of his fellow inmates were tortured to death. This appeared to be confirmation.
Another inmate told him the group he'd seen were known as the Eighth Team, and they worked on what was called the ""ghost job"".
Not long afterwards, in June 2008, a guard called out Sun Yi's name. He was taken to a building and sent to a room on the fourth floor. He realised he'd been assigned to the Eighth Team - the very last thing he had wanted to happen.
When he entered the room, Sun Yi saw what looked like a tombstone in front of him. He picked it up and realised it was made of white polystyrene. It would soon be covered in black dye, and it would be Sun Yi's job to make it look old by rubbing it with a wet sponge until the white underneath began to show through.
Sun Yi had no idea what Halloween was, though it came as a great relief that no actual dead bodies were involved - it was baffling to him that anyone would want these morbid decorations.
""He was wondering why people would buy this kind of scary stuff,"" says Canadian film-maker Leon Lee, who would later get to know Sun Yi. ""Until one day a guard told him Western people have this kind of a culture, a so-called festival, and that's why they are making it.""
Soon black dye covered Sun Yi's face and body. He worked from 04:00 until 23:00 or midnight, breaking only to eat. At night, he later recalled, his hands would move as he slept, as if he was polishing tombstones in his dreams.
Before his arrest, Sun Yi had been an engineer for an oil and gas company. His troubles began after a chance meeting with a group of people exercising outdoors near his home in Beijing - they were practising Falun Gong, a spiritual movement loosely based on Taoism and Buddhism, and Sun Yi soon joined up.
Falun Gong was initially tolerated by China's communist authorities after its emergence in the early 1990s, but after a few years they began to see the movement as potential threat, because of its growing size. Criticisms began to appear in the state media, prompting some 10,000 practitioners to take part in a silent protest outside the ruling Communist Party's Beijing headquarters in 1999. The movement was banned soon after that.
The Chinese government then launched a relentless publicity campaign against Falun Gong, branding it an ""evil cult"". Its followers soon had to practise in secret, risking prosecution and arrest.
In February 2008, during a crackdown in the run-up to the Beijing Olympics, Sun Yi was caught. Arrested during a raid at an underground press, he was sentenced to two-and-a-half years in prison.
That is when he was taken to Masanjia, a ""re-education through labour"" camp in the north-east of the country that housed criminals as well as dissidents and political prisoners.
While he was there, his wife wrote to him telling him she wanted a divorce. She and other relatives had been harassed and detained following his arrest, and she knew that members of her family would fail background checks - and therefore be unable to get jobs - as long as she was married to him.
Sun Yi held on to the letter. It was the only thing in Masanjia that was his.
Around this time, an idea occurred to him. He knew the graveyard kits he was making were for export because the labels were in English. Why not write letters and hide them inside the boxes? Maybe someone would find one and tell the world what was happening in Masanjia?
One night, as he lay in his cell surrounded by 30 or 40 sleeping fellow inmates, Sun Yi turned on his side so that he faced the wall. All he could hear were the crickets chirping outside. Quietly, he opened a sheet of paper and pulled out a pen. He knew that guards were on patrol.
He picked up his pen and began to write.
Sun Yi later estimated he had written about 20 letters in total during his time at Masanjia. He had to be careful about slipping them into the tombstone kits because he never knew which ones would be inspected. He usually did it during breaks, when other prisoners were outside.
But once, as he put a letter into a box, another inmate saw what he was doing. Sun Yi had to take a risk and tell him what he was up to.
""Good,"" said the other prisoner. ""Do you have any more that I could help you hide?""
Sun Yi began sharing his letters with other Falun Gong devotees inside the camp, and one night one of the notes was discovered by guards during a search. The guards tortured the prisoner on whom the letter was found - they knew he must have an accomplice, because he didn't speak English. But he didn't reveal Sun Yi's involvement.
Although Sun Yi escaped further punishment on that occasion, he didn't manage to evade the next crackdown against Falun Gong prisoners. Like many others, he was forced to stand with his wrists handcuffed to a bunk bed in an effort to make him recant. If he fell asleep, his legs would give way and the handcuffs would cut into him like knives.
Sun Yi was released from Masanjia in September 2010. He carried on practising Falun Gong and printing samizdat literature, but he kept a low profile. And then in 2012, while browsing Western news sites on the internet - he'd found a way to bypass China's censorship of the web - he came across a story about a letter that had been found among a box of Halloween decorations in Oregon. His letter.
Four months after the story about Julie's Halloween decorations went viral, a Chinese magazine called Lens published an expose about conditions inside Masanjia. The online version of the story was later deleted, but the Chinese authorities appear to have been shaken by the publicity. Shortly afterwards the government announced that it was ending the ""education through labour"" system and freeing some 160,000 prisoners.
It was not long after this that Julie heard Sun Yi - indirectly at first. ""The New York Times contacted me and told me that they had been in contact with him and that they were doing a story,"" she says. He'd written another letter - this time, it was just for her. In it, he wrote ""that he was very glad that I publicised the letter - that's exactly what he wanted"", Julie remembers.
""I was so thrilled - to know that he was alive, for one, and that he was proud of me and just knowing that I did the right thing.""
Sun Yi had not only been contacted by the New York Times, but also by Leon Lee, a Canadian director with a record of covering human rights abuses in China. Sun Yi agreed to be the subject of a film and began sending Lee footage of himself.
He understood this was an enormous risk.
He and his ex-wife were planning to remarry and leave China together, but then a fresh crackdown on Falun Gong practitioners began. Police raided Sun Yi's ex-wife's home and told her to contact them if she saw Sun Yi. Before long, Sun Yi was arrested.
While he was in custody, though, his health began to deteriorate, so he was released on health grounds - and he took the opportunity to flee to Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia, with help from Leon Lee.
Life was tough there. Sun Yi applied for refugee status, but as an asylum seeker he was unable to work. He couldn't contact his wife for fear of getting her into trouble with the Chinese authorities. Living off his savings, he spent his days learning Indonesian and English.
It was at this point that Julie flew out to meet Sun Yi. Lee, who'd put them in touch, would be there to film the encounter. Julie had worried about him constantly during the four years that had passed since she'd found his letter. She had heard some of Sun Yi's story from Lee, and was troubled by the thought that she had contributed to his difficulties.
When she arrived at his modest apartment in Jakarta, she didn't know what to expect.
""It was like we had this instant connection,"" says Julie.
""He called me his sister. It was like we'd known each other forever.""
They exchanged gifts. He bought her flowers, while she bought him a book about life in Oregon. She also brought him the note he had written in Masanjia, and the polystyrene tombstone. ""He seemed really thankful to bring all this back full circle,"" Julie says.
He asked her about the festival of Halloween. What happened to the pumpkins after they were carved, Sun Yi wondered. Did you eat them? Julie explained this wasn't the custom. He also wanted to know what ""RIP"" stood for. Rest in Peace, Julie told him. She explained that it was a message of goodwill for the dead.
After she'd flown home, Sun Yi wept when he recalled Julie's visit. He had never imagined she would travel all that way to see him. ""I really appreciate that she did that,"" he tells Leon Lee, in an interview on camera. ""I don't know how to thank her. She feels like family.""
But if life in Jakarta was hard, it soon got worse. Shortly after Julie's visit, Sun Yi was contacted by a suspected Chinese agent - and two months later he died of acute kidney failure. Despite a request from his ex-wife and sisters, there was no investigation into the cause of death. Leon is suspicious: ""He had no kidney problems before and when I was there in Indonesia he seemed perfectly healthy.""
Julie was devastated when she heard the news. ""I so badly wanted a happy ending for him,"" she says.
She feels honoured to have known Sun Yi. ""He was the most resilient, strong person I have ever met - for someone to go through what he did and come out and be able to talk about it and share his experiences with the world - it's just incredible.""
Her chance connection with Sun Yi changed her life, she says. She became more globally aware - conscious of where the products in the dollar stores near her home had come from, and she resolved to pass on this understanding to her children.
For human rights campaigners, the relevance of Sun Yi's story hasn't diminished. When the re-education through labour system formally ended, Amnesty International said many camps were simply renamed prisons or rehabilitation centres, and that dissidents and Falun Gong followers continued to be held in them, often without trial. Torture remained ""widespread"" in cases considered politically sensitive, including those of Falun Gong practitioners, the organisation reported in 2015.
Recently, China has been accused of locking up hundreds of thousands of Muslims without trial in its western region of Xinjiang. The government denies the claims, but a BBC investigation found significant new evidence of internment camps.
Leon Lee's film Letter from Masanjia received its UK premier at the Cambridge International Film Festival on 26 October.
Kati Pohler was abandoned in a market in China when she was three days old. Her parents left a note saying they would meet her on a famous bridge 10 or 20 years later.

Australia's immigration department confirmed the man died at Brisbane Hospital on Friday.
His actions were a ""political protest"", according to the Nauruan government.
Australia sends asylum seekers it intercepts for processing at offshore locations, including Nauru, a small Pacific Island nation.
The man, known as Omid, set himself on fire at the Nauru detention centre on Tuesday and was airlifted to Brisbane Hospital in Australia with severe burns to his torso.
A statement from the Department of Immigration and Border Protection said it was providing ""appropriate support"" to the man's wife and friends.
Graphic video footage of the incident, which reportedly occurred during a United Nations visit to the island, has been published on Australian news websites.
This man's death comes as Australia's other offshore processing centre on Manus Island in Papua New Guinea, is threatened with closure.
Papua New Guinea's Supreme Court ruled the detention of asylum seekers was unconstitutional and therefore illegal on Tuesday.
The fate of around 850 asylum seekers and refugees on Manus Island - all men - remains uncertain, with Australian and Papua New Guinean officials set to hold talks early next week.
After the Supreme Court's decision, Papuan New Guinea Prime Minister Peter O'Neill told Australia it must close the Manus Island centre and make new arrangements.
But Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has repeatedly said that none of the men on Manus Island will come to Australia.
Mr Turnbull also ruled out sending them to New Zealand, which has previously offered to take some of the refugees Australia refuses to settle, as this would provide a ""marketing opportunity"" for people smugglers.
""We have to be very, very clear eyed about this. We can't afford to let the empathy that we feel for the desperate circumstances that many people find themselves in to cloud our judgment,"" Mr Turnbull said.
""Our national security has to come first.""
Meanwhile five MPs from the opposition Labor party have broken ranks and declared they do not support Australia's offshore processing regime.
The tough immigration policy has bipartisan support from Labor and the ruling coalition.
Labor MP Melissa Parke, a former lawyer with the United Nations, said the policy was ""a sick game that needs to end"".
""It's inevitable that the government will need to have another plan for what is going to happen, and the most logical thing to do is to bring those people to Australia,"" Ms Parke told Fairfax Media."

The agency said an estimated 33,000 unaccompanied children are expected.
It said it needs an extra 70 billion Swedish krona ($8.4bn; £5.4bn) over the next two years to cope with arrivals.
Separately, more than 12,600 migrants crossed into Slovenia from Croatia on Wednesday, police said.
Slovenia, which became a route for migrants after Hungary closed its border, has said it can only manage 2,500 entries per day.
The number of migrants reaching Europe has reached record levels in 2015:
Long winter sets in: EU pins hope on deteriorating weather
Crisis in graphics: Migration numbers explained
Expected accommodation shortfalls in Sweden could see tens of thousands of asylum seekers spend the winter in heated tents.
""We have seen pictures of people who are literally walking from Greece across the Balkans to Germany and on to Sweden,"" Migration Agency head Anders Danielsson said.
More than 100,000 asylum seekers have so far arrived in Sweden in 2015, well above the 74,000 previously forecast for the entire year.
At a minimum, the agency expects 140,000 asylum seekers in total.
Although polls indicate that most Swedes are welcoming of refugees, there have been several recent attacks on centres housing asylum seekers.
On Wednesday, Italy sent 70 Eritrean and Syrian asylum seekers to Sweden and Finland under a controversial EU-funded relocation plan designed to ease the burden on frontline countries where migrants arrive.
The EU plans to relocate close to 160,000 migrants from Italy and Greece with a compulsory quota system that was opposed by some countries in the bloc.
Slovenia, meanwhile, has seen more than 34,000 migrants cross into the country from Croatia since Saturday.
Thousands of migrants have been moving through the western Balkans as they try to reach northern Europe amid tough conditions and plunging temperatures.
Hungary's closure of its border with Croatia forced migrants to switch to a slower route via Slovenia, a country of two million.
Slovenia has accused Croatia of allowing too many migrants to cross into its territory.
The EU's migration commissioner is visiting the country on Thursday to discuss its request for financial assistance from the EU and help from other states' police forces.
European Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker has called a special summit of Balkan leaders for Sunday in order to find a better strategy to manage the migrant flows.
A note on terminology: The BBC uses the term migrant to refer to all people on the move who have yet to complete the legal process of claiming asylum. This group includes people fleeing war-torn countries such as Syria, who are likely to be granted refugee status, as well as people who are seeking jobs and better lives, who governments are likely to rule are economic migrants."

Sam Nemati, sole guardian of the eight-year-old girl, admitted the charge and was ordered to pay A$200 ($155; £109).
Mr Nemati had been in the detention centre for two years.
Australia relocates undocumented migrants trying to reach the country by boat to Nauru and Papua New Guinea.
Nauru is a small Pacific island nation about 3,000 km (1,800 miles) north-east of Australia.
It was previously administered by Australia but gained independence in 1968.
Prosecutors had originally sought a two-month custodial sentence for Mr Nemati, arguing that such a sentence could be used as a deterrent, Australian media report.
""We are concerned that this method of protest is being used and want to stamp out this practice,"" prosecutors said.
The pair moved to Nibok Lodge in January, where Mr Nemati said his daughter would have more children to play with.
However, the authorities said they were not authorised to live there, and moved to evict the pair on 21 January.
Mr Nemati became distressed when officers began removing his belongings, and attempted to take his own life.
He was taken to hospital for medical treatment before being charged and subsequently detained for two weeks in February.
The law against attempted suicide in Nauru is based on the 1899 Queensland Criminal Code.
However, while Queensland has since repealed that particular law, attempted suicide remains illegal in Nauru.
Other existing offences under the code include witchcraft, sorcery and fortune-telling.
Why is Australia's asylum policy controversial?
In early February, the High Court upheld Australia's asylum policy as legal under the country's constitution.
The ruling paved the way for around 267 people, including 37 babies, to be deported to Nauru."
http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-35999728,asylum seeker,476,9 April 2016,None,French action urged over Calais asylum-seeker children,"England's children's commissioner has asked the French government to help lone children in Calais's refugee camp reach relatives in the UK.
Anne Longfield has written to French authorities to ask them to speed up the asylum claims of 150 children who may be eligible to travel to the UK.
She also claimed the French were not protecting lone children at the camp.
A French Embassy official said his country had done ""a great deal"" to ensure the children's welfare.
The children, some as young as 10, have fled fighting in Syria and elsewhere.
Ms Longfield told BBC Breakfast that unaccompanied children at the camp were very vulnerable.
""We're talking about cardboard shacks - it rains, they fall down. They're by themselves, it's extraordinarily dangerous, they're at risk of health [problems], trafficking, any manner of danger there.
""They're not being protected while they're there [and] some of those children are actually eligible to join their close family here.""
In her letter, Ms Longfield also expressed concern about children who are thought to have disappeared since the French authorities dismantled parts of the camp, known as the Jungle, earlier this year.
She said 129 of them had gone missing, the charities working with them had tried hard to trace them and the authorities must do likewise.
Charity workers are said to have identified the children who are potentially eligible to move to the UK because they have parents or siblings there.
Ms Longfield's call follows a visit to the camp to meet children living there alone while waiting for their cases to be reviewed.
She said: ""I have asked the French authorities to urgently determine which of the children in the Calais refugee camp are eligible to come to the UK, to ensure their safety and to process their applications immediately.
""It is unacceptable that at the moment some are waiting up to nine months before they learn whether or not they can come.
""We expect authorities in the UK to make sure vulnerable children in England are looked after and we expect nothing less of the French government.""
A spokesman for the French embassy in London said there were, ""indeed, several dozens of lone minors in Calais who have links to the UK and, according to the Dublin agreement, would have the right to enter Britain to be reunited with their relatives there"".
He said French authorities had identified them and sent details to UK counterparts.
""France has done a great deal to ensure the welfare of those children,"" he said.
""When part of the so-called ""jungle"" was dismantled, they were relocated to the emergency accommodation nearby.
""However it is by no means a prison, they are not locked in and we cannot prevent them from leaving should they wish to do so, while they are waiting for the UK to decide on whether to admit them."""

Three years ago Cambridgeshire County and Peterborough City councils were looking after just six children.
They are now responsible for 138 and are having to house them as far away as Nottingham. It is one of the biggest increases in the country.
Peterborough council said the rise was putting a ""strain"" on its services.
And both Peterborough and Cambridgeshire warn the numbers will rise to help ease pressures in Kent, where about 900 unaccompanied child migrants are currently housed.
Cathy Smith, first response and emergency duty officer at Cambridgeshire County Council, said the county council was only coping with the influx by using out-of-county placements more than 100 miles (160km) away.
""Social workers are often scouring the country trying to find placements for these young people.""
Wali, now 18, arrived on his own in the UK on the back of a lorry from Iran aged 17.
""I was living in Iran and I left because I was having some problems with smugglers who wanted me to work with them.
""I went to Turkey, Bulgaria, Serbia, Austria, Italy and then to France and then to England. There was no-one here for me.
""They gave us clothes and accommodation and I have gone to college. If they did not help we would be homeless people living in the street.""
He said he was very grateful for the support he had been given by the authorities since arriving and said without it he would not have been able to cope.
Nicola Curly, assistant director of children's services at Peterborough City Council, said about one in 11 of its children in care was now a migrant.
""These are very traumatised young children,"" she said. ""They have had long and difficult journeys and they need a lot of support when they arrive.""
She added: ""We have no option when a young person arrives.
""If they need accommodation and support then we have to provide that. It is starting to place a strain on our placement capacity. We are anticipating more children and young people. We have no idea how many."""
http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-35915818,asylum seeker,1186,1 April 2016,By Marc Ellison,Asylum seeker home defects not fixed within timescales,"Concerns have been raised over the number of asylum seekers who did not have defects in their homes fixed within agreed timescales.
A BBC investigation revealed defects including mould, water leaks, damp walls, and a lack of heating.
An ex-employee also claimed cost-cutting by housing provider Orchard & Shipman (O&S) was ""absolutely endemic"".
Contractor Serco, on behalf of O&S, said an increase in defects last year was due to improved self-monitoring.
O&S has managed the £221m Home Office contract for asylum seeker accommodation in Scotland and Northern Ireland, on behalf of international service company Serco, since September 2012.
These claims follow recent controversies which revealed O&S may have changed the locks of asylum seekers' homes, and allegedly placed people in dirty and dangerous accommodation.
Thousands of asylum seekers in Glasgow have come from all over the world including Somalia, Zimbabwe, Pakistan and Eritrea - many have fled war, torture, sexual abuse or persecution.
A BBC Scotland freedom of information request - which the Home Office took eight months to respond to - revealed 199 asylum seekers in a 12-month period were ""impacted"" by faults not repaired by O&S within agreed contractual timescales.
A Home Office contract stipulates that O&S is required to ensure that all asylum seeker accommodation be safe, habitable, fit for purpose and correctly equipped.
The data shows that in the last six months of 2014, 56 service users were affected by defects not fixed within set timescales, and between January and July 2015 that figure rose to 143 - an increase of 155%.
Defects included: bedroom space capacity; water ingresses; faulty heaters, fridges and washing machines; damp walls; damaged windows, leaking sinks, as well as more routine repairs.
The UK Parliament's Home Affairs Committee announced earlier this month that it is to launch an inquiry into the provision of accommodation to asylum seekers in Glasgow.
Labour MP Keith Vaz, chair of the committee, said he was ""concerned"" by the figures.
He said: ""If Home Office inspectors identify issues with asylum seeker housing serious enough to require a response within one working day, then they must be complied with. ""
A Serco spokesman said the rise in defects not being fixed within agreed timescales was due to improved, and more intensive, self-monitoring by its subcontractor.
He said: ""Where issues were found, they [O&S] reported the failures themselves and addressed them.
""This is the sign of good rather than poor management.""
Serco said 21,930 repairs were logged across 1,800 properties over the 12-month period - the majority of which were for routine maintenance.
The multinational outsourcing company said the rate of not fixing defects within agreed timescales during this period was 0.26%.
According to the Home Office contract the majority of the defects should have been made safe within one working day, and permanently remedied with a week, to make accommodation ""fit for purpose"".
Six people were ""impacted"" by defects deemed more serious and which, according to the contract, should have been resolved within 24 hours to make the accommodation ""habitable"".
However a Serco spokesperson said these particular defects were due to three heating failures, that temporary heating was provided in each case, and that the defect was left 'open' resulting in it being deemed a failure.
Shafiq Mohammed - who worked as a housing procurement officer at O&S between February 2012 and August 2014 and has now talked to BBC Scotland - claimed he was put under pressure to take on properties he knew were not compliant.
He said: ""You know that a property is without doubt a single bedroom but you're forced to classify it as a double bedroom, so you can get two people in it.
""[And there are] properties that clearly have real problems with their heating and their hot water systems to the point where they're clapped out - they're simply not working.
""They'll pick up the cheapest accommodation that they can, they'll do as little as possible as far as repairs are concerned.""
He added: ""There's always an excuse not to do something - they're very, very good at that.
""The culture was 'profit is king', cost-cutting and cutting corners in terms of the service [was] absolutely endemic.""
Mr Mohammed also claimed ""a culture of fear"" meant many asylum seekers - without any intimidation by O&S staff - may not report any housing defects for fear of being deported.
He said: ""They would withdraw complaints so the heating hasn't been working for the last week - 'I better not complain, they'll get annoyed with me'.
""The lighting's not been working in the bedroom for three weeks, I'll try and fix it myself.""
A Home Office spokesman said: ""The UK has a proud history of granting asylum to those who need it and providing safe and secure accommodation while applications are considered.
""It is the responsibility of the Compass providers to ensure the standards of the contract are met. The Home Office and providers regularly inspect properties to ensure the accommodation meets contractual standards.""
He added: ""Where a contractor is found to be falling short of these standards, we work with them to ensure issues are quickly addressed and when they are not we can and do impose sanctions.
""The government expects the highest standards from our contractors. If we find any evidence of discrimination against asylum seekers it will be dealt with immediately as any such behaviour will not be tolerated.""
A Serco spokesman said there was no evidence to support any of Mr Mohammed's allegations.
He said: ""All the housing leased by us is fit for purpose at the point of procurement.
""We repair all defects reported to us, the overwhelming majority within the required timeframe.""
Amanda - not her real name - said last year it took the company several weeks to replace her washing machine.
But when the appliance did finally arrive it didn't work.
She said: ""I complained to them [O&S] and they sent someone to come and repair it.
""I was telling them we can't stay in the house, it's really, really smelly and the inside is full of mould.""
Depending on the level of ""non-conformance"" under the contract, the Home Office may apply financial penalties to the monthly invoice of a housing provider.
In February 2015 it was revealed Serco had paid out £443,545 in penalties in Scotland and Northern Ireland - an increase of 184% compared to the previous, full fiscal year.
None of the other contracted housing providers - including G4S and Clearel - incurred any penalties in this fiscal year.
The parliamentary question that prompted the release of these figures was submitted by SNP MP Stuart McDonald who sits on the Home Affairs Committee.
Mr McDonald said: ""These [freedom of information] figures suggest some real challenges in ensuring asylum accommodation is fit for purpose.
""The nature of some of the defects is also a concern - including issues such as mould and water leaks.
""The bottom line is that we a very incomplete understanding about how the [Home Office] contracts are functioning and what needs to be done to make them as effective as they must be for everyone concerned."""

Nigel Allcoat, 65, from Burbage, Leicestershire, offered to pay towards a £180 fine imposed on a man in his 20s, at Leicester Magistrates' Court.
The fine was introduced by the government to help towards the running of the courts system and ensure criminals ""pay their way"".
Mr Allcoat said his offer had been a simple ""humanitarian"" act.
He said: ""He was seeking asylum, which means it would have been breaking the law if he had been found with money or working, so how was he to pay this charge?""
Asylum seekers are given top-up cards which have £35 added to their balance each week and can only be spent in certain stores.
Rather than leaving the man short, Mr Allcoat, who has served for 16 years as a magistrate, reached into his own pocket.
He said: ""My offer was simply humanitarian, otherwise this man would have appeared and reappeared... for non-payment, knowing that on any occasion he could be sent to prison.""
Mr Allcoat was suspended from his duties following the case three weeks ago and investigated by the Lord Chancellor's Advisory Committee but he has now resigned.
He said: ""It was a young man in his 20s from Europe who has been ordered to pay this charge and was brought in front of me as he hadn't paid.
""I just can't belong to an organisation that puts people in foolish situations like this.
""[The charge] was slipped in to the legal system just at the end of the last government without any real thinking as to the consequences.
""It can't be waived, it's not means-tested, it can't be remitted. You can't do anything about it as a magistrate. It's utterly foolish.""
A number of magistrates have resigned in protest over the criminal courts charge after it was introduced in April.
A Ministry of Justice spokesman said: ""It is right that convicted adult offenders who use our criminal courts should pay towards the cost of running them.
""Offenders can pay in affordable instalments linked to their ability to pay. Magistrates and judges do not have to order prompt payment in full.""
Magistrates' Association chairman Richard Monkhouse said his members had ""expressed concerns about the charge from the outset"".
""The law is the law and we have a sworn duty to apply it, so we've made our views known to the Lord Chancellor and will continue to do so."""

It happened at the Home Office asylum support offices at Link House.
Abraham Eiluorior, of the campaigning and support group Beyond Borders Tyneside, said houses were being raided early in the morning.
The Home Office said the UK had a ""proud history"" of providing asylum, but those who did not need protection would be expected to leave.
Mr Eiluorior said: ""They normally come like thieves in the night to raid asylum seekers and deport them to countries where they fear persecution and violence.
""The suddenness of these raids makes it very difficult for families to contact or access appropriate legal processes.
""It is very traumatic for both the family and for the community left behind.""
He said the deportations happened ""almost every day"" and people were often taken straight to Heathrow airport.
The raids were usually conducted at about 04:30 or 05:00, he said.
He also claimed some were deported before they had finished the official process of making their case to stay.
""These dawn raids are carried out in secret - families with young children are being taken from their beds without anyone knowing.""
The Home Office said in a statement: ""The UK has a proud history of granting asylum to those who genuinely need it, but where someone is found not to need our protection, we expect them to leave the country voluntarily.
""This is important in ensuring that our help is directed to those who really need it.
""Assistance can be provided to people found not to have the right to remain in the UK in returning to their home country. If they refuse to engage with this process we will enforce their removal."""

Allegations of poor treatment were raised at PMQs by the SNP's Westminster leader Angus Robertson.
He was speaking following a BBC Scotland investigation into claims asylum seekers in Glasgow might have been locked out of their homes.
Mr Cameron said he was happy to have such issues ""properly"" looked at.
He then pointed to a report by the Home Affairs Select Committee which concluded there was an ""impending shortage"" of housing for asylum seekers.
It also said that there was an unequal distribution of asylum seekers in the UK with Glasgow having had the most - 3,084 people - as of the end of 2015.
Mr Robertson raised the matter of how people looking for sanctuary in the UK are treated during Mr Cameron's weekly House of Commons question and answer session.
He said: ""This week the Scottish Refugee Council called for an investigation into allegations about the way asylum seekers are treated and housed in Glasgow.
""They want the Home Office to commission an independent inquiry into claims of substandard housing and dehumanising treatment of refugees by the private company contracted to provide accommodation services by your government.
""Will you commission that investigation?""
Mr Cameron responded by saying: ""We are very happy for these issues to be properly investigated.
""The Home Affairs Select Committee in this House of Commons has just done a report into the way that asylum housing is commissioned and of course if the Scottish Parliament wants to carry out those investigations, of course the United Kingdom government will cooperate with that.""
He added: ""What we need to do is make sure that where we take people in, we make sure they are properly housed, properly looked after, their children are schooled, because that's the sort of generous country we are.""
Scottish Labour leader Kezia Dugdale also called for an investigation into the treatment of asylum seekers.
She said: ""The prime minister cannot continue to ignore the stories we are hearing about the frankly inhumane treatment of asylum seekers.
""David Cameron should do the decent thing and order an independent inquiry today.
""The Scottish response to the refugee crisis was inspiring. As millions of people fled war on the other side of the world, Scottish families, councils and charities stepped up to do their bit.
""Our humanity cannot stop there, and accounts of refugees being threatened, humiliated and treated as second class citizens by staff working on contracts handed out by the UK Government should shock David Cameron into action.""
The BBC Scotland investigation was told of allegations that asylum seekers could have been locked out of their homes in breach of agreed eviction guidelines.
An ex-employee of housing provider Orchard & Shipman (O&S) said this ""brutal"" practice was leaving people homeless.
The housing company has strongly denied breaching guidelines.
O&S has managed the £221m Home Office contract for asylum seeker accommodation in Scotland and Northern Ireland, on behalf of international service company Serco, since September 2012.
Asylum seekers in Scotland come from all over the world including Somalia, Zimbabwe, Pakistan and Eritrea."
http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-politics-34145561,asylum seeker,346,3 September 2015,None,Asylum seeker 'share' plea by Newport council,"Newport City Council has called for other local authorities to take a ""greater share"" of asylum seekers, saying it was reaching its limit.
Local MP Paul Flynn said the dispersal system was placing a ""great burden"" on the city and its public services.
He said the number of asylum seekers in Newport had doubled since 2012.
The council said it was ""extremely sympathetic"" to the plight of Syrian refugees, but was ""now close to its maximum quota"" under government policy.
Chancellor George Osborne said Britain had accepted 5,000 refugees from Syria so far, but Labour has called on the UK government to commit to take at least 10,000.
Welsh Tory leader Andrew RT Davies has called on Britain to ""take its share"", but would not say how many that should be.
Official statistics show that at the end of June, Wales had 2,355 asylum seekers, around 7.6 percent of the UK total of 30,457 and the highest level since 2007.
Cardiff, Newport, Swansea and Wrexham are the UK's designated dispersal areas in Wales for asylum seekers.
Mr Flynn, MP for Newport West, said the city had fewer than 200 asylum seekers in 2012 but nearly 460 now.
""Newcomers bring the benefit of a more diverse, vibrant city but create significant pressures on local services such as schools,"" he said.
Writing on his blog, he accused senior Tories of providing shelter to few refugees in their own constituencies.
A spokesperson for Newport City Council said a ""significant number"" of asylum seeking families had been placed in the city over the past few years.
""There has been a vast increase in the level of dispersals over recent months because of the increasingly desperate situations in Syria and other countries,"" the spokesperson added.
""As a result, Newport is now close to its maximum quota of asylum seekers according to UK government policy.
""We fully support those who are trying to assist people who have had to flee their countries and believe other council areas, particularly in south east Wales, should now be taking a greater share of asylum seekers."""
http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-35719489,asylum seeker,734,4 March 2016,None,'Impending shortage' of asylum seeker homes in the UK,"There is an ""impending shortage"" of housing for asylum seekers in the UK, the home affairs committee has warned.
The issue is being made worse by a lack of ""fair and equal dispersal"", with some areas receiving hundreds of people and others getting none, its MPs said.
The report includes Home Office figures showing where asylum seekers are being housed, with Glasgow having the most - 3,084 people - as of the end of 2015.
The Home Office said it was committed to providing safe and secure housing.
The committee said its findings ""leave major questions"" to be answered about the running of government contracts to provide asylum support services - collectively called Compass.
Why do so many asylum seekers live in Middlesbrough?
As part of the scheme, asylum seekers are found accommodation while their applications are being considered, often in areas where cheap housing is available.
Local authorities in those areas are then required to provide any education, health or specialist services those people may require.
Committee chairman Keith Vaz said the dispersal system ""appears unfair, with whole swathes of the country never receiving a single asylum seeker"".
""The majority are being moved into low-cost housing in urban areas such as Glasgow, Stoke, Cardiff and of course Middlesbrough, where the ratio is one asylum seeker per 137 people.
""However, on the data we have received, local authorities in areas such as Maidenhead, Lincoln and Warwick have housed none.""
Other areas listed in the report as having no-one in receipt of aid given to asylum seekers - known as Section 95 support - in the final quarter of 2015 included Cambridge, Cornwall, Midlothian and York.
Local authorities with few asylum seekers, or none, should be ""actively encouraged by ministers to volunteer"" to take some, the MPs said.
The three private firms that operate the programme known as Compass, the Home Office and the home affairs committee all agree that getting more councils on board is the key to easing the chronic accommodation shortage. At present, 200 local authorities are involved.
It may well become a crisis if the number of asylum applicants continues to increase.
At 38,000 the rate is at its highest since 2004. Some councils would take part if the contractors could find enough suitable and affordable properties; in other areas, it may be the fear of a voter backlash which is putting off local politicians from agreeing to participate.
With the government committed to resettling 20,000 Syrians by 2020, as well as accommodating asylum seekers, ministers will have to find a solution - or face the prospect of housing more of them in two-star and three-star hotels.
The main Compass contractors are G4S, Clearsprings and Serco, and the committee said delivery ""has been mostly unsatisfactory to date"".
""G4S, Serco and Clearsprings receive millions of pounds of public money to house asylum seekers, and revelations in recent months have been alarming,"" Mr Vaz said.
""The compulsory wearing of wrist bands and the infamous red doors demonstrate an unacceptable attitude towards vulnerable people.
""The Home Office has failed to provide proper oversight and inspection, and must do better.""
MPs also condemned an ""appalling"" episode where asylum seekers in Cardiff were told to wear wristbands to demonstrate their eligibility for a service run by the Clearsprings Group.
There was also an instance in Middlesbrough - under a contract awarded to G4S - in which many asylum seekers' doors were painted the same colour, making the properties easily identifiable.
The Local Government Association - which represents more than 400 local authorities in England and Wales - said councils had shown in their response to the Syrian refugee crisis that they are willing to ""step in and help"".
But it said authorities were ""anxious"" that no council was given an unfair burden.
The Home Office said it was working with areas that had not been involved so far in asylum dispersal.
A spokesman said: ""The Home Office has worked closely with our providers to improve property standards over the lifetime of the Compass contract.
""Where a contractor is found to be falling short of these standards, we work with them to ensure issues are quickly addressed. When they are not, we can and do impose sanctions.
""All suppliers are meeting the contractual requirements to provide safe, habitable, fit for purpose and correctly equipped accommodation in compliance with the Housing Act 2004 and the Decent Homes Standard."""

Ali Bashar, 20, was arrested by Kurdish authorities in northern Iraq at the request of German police, Interior Minister Horst Seehofer said.
Germans were outraged that an airport security blunder allowed him to flee.
Susanna Feldman's murder has rekindled criticism of Chancellor Angela Merkel's immigration policy.
The leader of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party said Mrs Merkel should resign and called for a protest on Saturday.
It comes as Mr Seehofer moves forward with controversial plans to hold asylum seekers in centres until their right to stay is determined. He has also vowed to speed up asylum procedures and increase deportations.
More than a million migrants arrived in the country in 2015 although the number of arrivals has since fallen.
Susanna Feldman, from the city of Mainz, was reported missing last month. On Wednesday her body was found near the refugee centre where Bashar lived. She was last seen at the refugee centre, local media reported.
The teenager was Jewish but police said there was no evidence her religion was a factor in the crime. The Central Council of Jews in Germany said many details in the case remained unclear and called for a thorough investigation.
Police said Bashar and his family were able to board a plane from Düsseldorf even though the names on their identity documents did not match those on their tickets, police said.
Bashar had arrived in Germany in 2015 with his parents and five siblings but had his asylum request refused the same year and was due to be deported. However he obtained a temporary residence permit while he waited for his appeal to be heard.
During that time he became known to police in connection with several violent incidents, including an alleged robbery, possession of a knife and fighting. He was also among several people suspected of sexually assaulting an 11-year-old girl who was living in the same refugee shelter.
Susanna Feldman's murder follows similar cases that have also caused widespread shock.
In March Afghan asylum seeker Hussein Khavari was jailed for life for the rape and murder of student Maria Ladenburger.
Last December an Afghan migrant was arrested on suspicion of stabbing his 15-year-old ex-girlfriend to death in a pharmacy.
Tabloid Bild said such incidents were ""explosive for our society"". Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung said ""these cases seem to be adding up"" and Tagesspiegel said that it was ""particularly sad"" that the victims were ""interested, curious and... tried to befriend"" migrants."

Doctors at a Brisbane hospital are refusing to discharge the girl, Asha, who is expected to be sent back to the Australian-run detention centre.
The daughter of asylum-seeker parents suffered serious burns at the camp.
Former immigration minister Scott Morrison said the policy would continue ""absolutely"" and ""completely.""
The government says its controversial offshore detention policy is necessary, and aimed at preventing asylum seekers trying to reach Australia on unseaworthy boats.
Australia's High Court upheld Australia's asylum policy as legal under the country's constitution in a decision handed down at the beginning of February.
Doctors at Brisbane's Lady Cilento Children's Hospital say they won't release Asha unless a ""suitable home environment is identified"".

Ibrahim - not his real name - received a letter four weeks ago from the Home Office telling him he was banned from further study.
It arrived two weeks before he was due to sit his English language exams.
As a 19-year-old asylum seeker from North Africa living in a foreign country and speaking a new language, he says his English classes - he was studying English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL) - had become a lifeline.
""Sometimes I cry. I even thought I would kill myself… this is one way I can make my life better but now they closed that one way"", says Ibrahim, who came to England three years ago because he faced threats in his own country.
He is one of more than 50 asylum seekers Newsnight has been told about who may have had inappropriate study restrictions imposed upon them.
It is the result of rule changes introduced in January after the introduction of the government's ""hostile environment"" immigration policy.
""I've certainly heard of getting on for 100 cases,"" says Adam Hundt, a solicitor with Deighton Pierce Glynn. ""I think it's quite clear that this will be affecting thousands of people.""
Since the beginning of the year, asylum seekers who used to be classified as having been granted temporary admission have been placed on ""immigration bail"".
The change was introduced as part of the Immigration Act 2016 and it affects migrants lawfully in the UK but without leave to remain, like asylum seekers.
The government said it was only intended to be used on a case-by-case basis when proportionate - for example, when they want to know the whereabouts of an asylum seeker, they could specify a particular institution where they could study.
During the passage of the legislation, the government gave assurances that it did not intend to impose a blanket ban on asylum seekers accessing education.
But campaigners and immigration lawyers say that appears to have been what has happened.
""We see about 50 asylum seekers a week on average at our advice drop-in and everybody that has come with a bail form has the restriction on study,"" says Becky Hellewell, a case worker with the charity St Augustine's Centre in Halifax.
Home Office staff are not the only group to have interpreted the guidance in this way.
The University of Leicester wrote to asylum seekers on its roll to update them that they were not permitted to use immigration bail conditions to study there.
But that should only have been the case if there was a restriction to study on their bail form - they should not have been prevented because they were on immigration bail.
A statement from the university said: ""All email communications on this matter are in accordance with government guidance provided to all universities.
""We change and update our communications in accordance with guidance from the government.""
The consequences for asylum seekers caught breaching these conditions can be severe.
They are liable to prosecution and could be subject to a fine and/or six months in prison.
Earlier this week, the Home Office minister Baroness Williams clarified in the House of Lords that the new immigration provisions were not designed to prevent asylum seekers from studying.
""The Home Office is proactively looking to identify cases where this has been applied inappropriately and will apply a new bail notice to the individual,"" she told peers.
This clarification came too late for Ibrahim.
He had to take the Home Office to court in order to have his study ban lifted just a day before his exams.
He has now been issued with a new bail notice removing his study restriction.
""I think what we've seen with the implementation of immigration bail provisions is that it's different depending on what area you are in,"" says Kamena Dorling of the charity Coram, which works with vulnerable children and young people.
""It's not being applied in accordance with the guidance, nor is it being applied consistently.""
The guidance that immigration officials were using has now been updated to say ""anyone who claims asylum should not have a study condition applied to them… If there is any doubt over whether study should be restricted, no study condition should be applied"".
The Home Office told Newsnight the study restrictions on immigration bail are not part of its ""compliant environment"" policy - the phrase preferred by the new Home Secretary Sajid Javid instead of ""hostile environment"".
A Home Office spokesperson said: ""Immigration bail is a valuable tool which enables individuals who are liable to be detained to remain in the community, subject to certain conditions.
""The provisions are not designed to be used to prevent asylum seekers studying and we are proactively looking to identify cases where this may have happened so that we can correct it.
""We have also updated our guidance for staff so that they are absolutely clear when to apply restrictions and we are putting in place new safeguards, so that when the restriction is applied, it has to be approved by a senior officer. These steps will make sure such an issue does not arise in the future."""
http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-32379221,asylum seeker,669,20 April 2015,By Jim Reed and Adam Eley,Asylum seeker: Why I chose the UK,"Fleeing violence in Syria, Majd travelled across the Mediterranean Sea to mainland Europe. But why did he choose the UK to seek asylum?
""[The UK] is open for all the world… if you're British or you're refugee, it doesn't matter,"" Majd - not his real name - tells the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme.
He speaks in broken English, but it is enough to convey why he fled his home town of Deraa, southern Syria - the city which kick-started the uprising against the government of Bashar al-Assad - in a journey that led him to the UK.
With government forces trying to reclaim his village from opposition rebels, on one occasion, he says, he was left to literally run for his life with his wife and one-year-old son.
""I saw one bomber [Syrian aircraft] was near us, maybe 30m [100ft] or 40m away,"" he says. ""When we felt it was very risky, we fell [to the ground] and tried to keep ourselves safe.""
With violence growing, he hoped to take his family to a refugee camp in Jordan, but it was closed due to overcrowding.
When he travelled to Lebanon to work, he was exploited by a boss who never paid him.
For Majd, the next choice was simple - Europe. ""Only Europe [will supply] a visa for [an asylum seeker's] family,"" he says. ""I can't stay without family.""
In particular, he sought the UK, knowing the language barrier would be much easier to overcome.
""The second language in Syria is English,"" he says. ""Another reason is for work. In England maybe you can work, it's easy to work.""
""I know some [other refugees] in Sweden and in other countries - they stay two years, but they can't work, and it's hard to learn the new language.""
But it is clear, also, that the UK has a reputation among migrants of tolerance and multiculturalism.
""Some friends... told us it's very good because nobody speak to you [like a] refugee, nobody look at you down.""
""If this great country can't keep us or save us, who can save us?"" says Majd.

His journey to the UK, however, was far from simple. The boat used to smuggle him from Libya to mainland Europe in February 2014 broke down, and it was another 36 hours before he was rescued by the Italian coastguard.
Majd was then taken to the mainland and released from detention. He travelled through Milan and Paris to the French port town of Calais, where after a week he successfully smuggled himself to the UK on a lorry.
After a few months in the UK, Majd was granted asylum and brought his young family over - legally - to Britain. He took a job in London before moving to Leeds, where he is now learning English at college.
""It was a good decision because I come here not just for me but for my kids,"" he says.
""They are very happy, but my wife is [finding it] hard because she's new here and doesn't speak English properly.""
He is also aware that some UK residents are hostile towards refugees.
""For the people who don't like refugees, I am sorry that I am coming here,"" he says earnestly. ""I understand them.
""Before [the violence] in Syria, I didn't think about coming to England or transferring to another country. But that's life.""
His overwhelming feeling, however, is one of gratitude.
""Really, I am happy. I am dreaming now. I stay one year and I think I dream,"" he says.
""I say thank you to the government and to the people who help us and give us support, and help us start again. Thank you.""

http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-australia-34773260,asylum seeker,505,10 November 2015,None,Australia asylum seeker rules criticised at UN rights council,"Several countries have used a United Nations forum to criticise Australia's asylum seeker policies.
The US, Britain and others said Australia should stop turning back migrant boats and using offshore detention centres.
The UN Human Rights Council conducts a review of every country's human rights record once every four years.
The criticism comes amid after the death of an asylum seeker who tried to escape.
Australia asylum: Why is it controversial?
More than 100 country representatives were critical of Australia's policies during the review including Sweden, Norway, Canada, Fiji, France, Germany and Switzerland.
""We remain concerned about Australia's protection of the rights of migrants, especially of women and children at offshore facilities,"" Turkey's delegate told the review, according to media reports.
Australian officials, who were given opportunities to respond, argued that the country's controversial polices save lives by discouraging dangerous ocean voyages, and allow it to resettle more refugees.
""The ensuring substantial and sustained reduction in maritime ventures as a result of Australia's managed approach to migration has resulted in Australia being able to resettle more refugees for our humanitarian programs,"" said Steve McGlynn, according to the ABC.
Several countries also urged Australia to legalise gay marriage, with Ireland, Iceland and the Netherlands reportedly saying the country had fallen behind other western nations by failing to recognise marriage equality.
""Revise the Marriage Act of 1961 in a way that ensures full equality with respect to the civil institution of marriage,"" the Netherlands reportedly noted.
""As a strong advocate of marriage equality and equal rights for all, The Netherlands notes that Australia's Marriage Act de facto discriminates against LGBTI people"".
Australia began turning around migrant boats trying to reach its shores after the election of the current Liberal-National coalition government in 2013.
Intercepted asylum seekers are sent to Christmas Island - an Australian territory in the Indian ocean, as well as Manus Island in Papua New Guinea and Nauru in the South Pacific.
Iran and North Korea also reportedly voiced concern, according to Australia's Fairfax Media.
Iran expressed its ""deep concern about the mandatory immigration detention regime"", according to the report.
Sweden's delegate told the UN session Australia was the only country that used offshore processing and mandatory detention of irregular immigrants, according to ABC.
Recently Australia announced a bid for a seat on the Human Rights Council for a three-year term starting in 2018.
Domestically, asylum is a hot political issue. Polls have shown that a significant number of Australians approve of taking a tougher stance.
The two biggest rival political groupings adopted tough policies ahead of the September 2013 polls. The Liberal-National coalition, which won, had campaigned in part on a ""stop the boats"" platform.
The government says the journey the asylum seekers make is dangerous and controlled by criminal gangs, and they have a duty to stop it.
However, critics say opposition to asylum is often racially motivated and is damaging Australia's reputation.
Australia granted close to 13,800 refugee visas between 2013 and 2014. It granted about 20,000 visas between 2012 and 2013."
http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-44399293,asylum seeker,817,7 June 2018,None,Stockholm lorry attacker Rakhmat Akilov jailed for life,"An Uzbek man who carried out a lorry attack which killed five people in Sweden last year has been sentenced to life for terrorist crimes.
Rakhmat Akilov, 40, had expressed sympathy for the Islamic State (IS) group before the attack in Stockholm.
But prosecutors had to prove he intended to harm the state, as IS did not say it was behind the attack.
Akilov, a rejected asylum seeker, fled the scene but was quickly arrested and confessed during police interrogation.
He left Uzbekistan for Sweden in 2014 and sought residency there, but in December 2016 he was told that he had four weeks to leave the country.
He disappeared and, a few months before the attack, was put on an official wanted list.
On 7 April last year, Akilov hijacked a lorry and drove it at high speed down one of Stockholm's busiest shopping streets and into a department store.
Five people were killed and 10 more injured in the attack on Drottninggatan (Queen Street).
Police discovered an explosive device inside the lorry which was made up of gas canisters and nails. It did not explode properly and only caused fire damage to the vehicle.
Akilov reportedly ran from the scene still covered in blood and glass, but was arrested hours later in a northern suburb of Stockholm.
He quickly confessed during police interrogation.
""He acted with the direct intention to kill as many people as possible,"" the court said in its verdict.
As well as the five murders, he was found guilty of the attempted murders of 119 other people who were at the scene of the attack.
Analysis by Maddy Savage, BBC News, Sweden
Rakhmat Akilov failed to get residency in Sweden but it seems he will now be staying in the Nordic nation in the long run, albeit locked up inside a Swedish jail.
Life sentences in Sweden typically amount to about 16 years. A spokesperson for Stockholm District Court has confirmed to the BBC that he will remain in the country during this time and is not expected to be transferred to a prison in Uzbekistan. After his jail term he will be deported from Sweden and banned from returning.
This was a landmark case in Sweden in which prosecutors had to prove that Rakhmat Akilov intended to harm the state in order to find him guilty of terror crimes.
But while the judgement made clear that the killer's actions did have a grave impact on the country, some have questioned whether the compensation awarded to the victims' relatives adequately reflects their more personal loss.
The spouses, parents, siblings and children of the five people who died will each receive 60,000 kronor (£5,160; $6,900). Their representatives had asked for 300,000 kronor each.
The youngest victim, Swedish schoolgirl Ebba Åkerlund, would have been celebrating her 13th birthday on Thursday. Her grieving father told the tabloid Expressen he was devastated that she was missing out on what ""should have been the happiest day of her life"".
Three Swedes, a Belgian woman and a British man were killed in the attack.
The British man was named as 41-year-old Chris Bevington who worked as a director with music streaming service Spotify.
The father-of-two was based in Stockholm with his family and reportedly threw his son to safety as the lorry sped towards them.
Following the attack, his father John described him as a ""wonderful husband, son, father, brother and close friend to many"".
Swedish national Marie Kide, 66, was also killed. She was a local politician for the Green Party in the town of Trollhattan, in western Sweden.
Party spokeswoman Esther O'Hara paid tribute to her. ""Marie leaves a huge void behind her, she was a woman with a big heart and courage in her convictions,"" she said.
The other Swedish victims were Lena Wahlberg, 69, and an 11-year-old girl, Ebba Åkerlund.
A 31-year-old Belgian woman, Maïlys Dereymaeker, from the city of Halle was also killed.
Rakhmat Akilov failed in his bid to get residency in Sweden, lost his job and was hiding from police who wanted to deport him prior to the attack.
According to reports, he had left a wife and four children behind in Uzbekistan to whom he was sending money.
In 2016, he reportedly lost his job after falling asleep at work. Bumping into a former colleague last year, he revealed he was spending his days ""sleeping and smoking"".
His Facebook page - which has been taken down - was linked to a number of extremists through friends and featured at least two propaganda videos linked to IS, one reportedly showing the aftermath of the Boston bombing.
During his trial, he said he wanted to punish Sweden for its part in the global fight against IS militants.
But he was not considered a threat by Swedish security services which dismissed him as a ""marginal character"", apparently on the fringes of larger militant movements."
http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-34478007,asylum seeker,503,8 October 2015,None,"Detained asylum seeker entitled to damages, court rules","An asylum seeker who says she fled from torture in Sudan is entitled to damages from the government after she was held unlawfully, the High Court has ruled.
The 42-year-old spent 37 days in a detention centre after arriving in England, despite strong evidence she had been raped and tortured repeatedly in her homeland, the court heard.
The judge said her detention had been ""unreasonable and truly disgraceful"".
Home Secretary Theresa May has conceded the woman's detention was unlawful.
In a case brought against the home secretary, the judge, Mr Justice Collins, said there was strong medical evidence to support the woman's claims she had been tortured in Sudan.
The woman was referred to in court as IKM and cannot be named for legal reasons.
She spent three weeks in hospital as a result of further damage to her health following her detention between December 2013 and January 2014, the court was told.
Ordering damages to be assessed either by the High Court or a county court, the judge said: ""She was someone who should not be detained unless there were very exceptional circumstances. There were none.""
The woman, who worked as an accountant in Sudanese capital Khartoum, said she had returned to her home village in Darfur to care for her family after her father was murdered and mother kidnapped by the Janjaweed militia group in 2004.
The court heard her fiance was killed in a later Janjaweed attack, and she was shot in the leg and raped.
The woman escaped to another village but was detained for three days in 2006 by state security agents on suspicion of being a Darfur rebel. She was raped, stabbed with a knife and beaten. She was raped and beaten when detained again in 2007.
In 2008 she came to England to study, but claimed asylum in the Republic of Ireland.
The judge said she had thought she could not make a claim in the UK because she possessed a student visa. But her claim and subsequent appeal were rejected in 2010 and she returned to England.
The Home Office certified that the EU's Dublin Regulation rules on asylum meant she should be returned to Ireland and that it was for the Irish authorities to conclude whether there were humanitarian reasons to give her refuge.
The regulation states asylum claims should be handled by the member state that played the greatest part in the applicant's entry or residence in the EU.
In his ruling, the judge quashed the Home Office decision and said IKM's story was consistent and credible, and up to five different doctors had agreed she was suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder.
He described the woman's asylum claim as a ""cast iron case"", although he stressed it would be for the Home Office to decide whether the woman should be allowed to stay.
The judge refused the home secretary's application to appeal against the decision. It is still open to the home secretary to make an appeal to the Court of Appeal directly."
http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-beds-bucks-herts-34464333,asylum seeker,301,7 October 2015,None,Home Office apologises to illegally held asylum seeker,"The government has apologised to a pregnant asylum seeker unlawfully held at Yarl's Wood Immigration Removal Centre.
The Congolese woman was five months pregnant when she was arrested in 2014. Currently pregnant women should only be detained in exceptional circumstances.
In a High Court settlement, the Home Office admitted her detention was a ""breach of policy"".
It will also review its policy for pregnant asylum seekers.
The Secretary of State authorised the detention of the woman, known only as Ms PA, on 3 February so that she could be interviewed by the Congolese authorities as part of a request for an emergency travel document.
She was held for ten hours at Cardiff Bay police station before being transferred in an eight-hour journey to Yarl's Wood.
Ms PA told officials she was due to have her 20-week scan but this did not take place during her four-week detention, during which time she was seen by a midwife once.
She was released on 4 March and had her scan a week later.
Detention policy in regard to pregnant women states they are ""normally considered suitable for detention in only very exceptional circumstances"" or where ""removal is imminent"".
Her detention was challenged on the grounds of ""unlawful arrest, detention and treatment"" and ""unlawful implementation of the policy"".
The Home Office agreed she was ""unlawfully detained"" and ante-natal care ""did not meet the standards expected"" and has issued a written apology.
It has also agreed to pay her damages and to review its policy by carrying out a ""targeted consultation"".
A spokesman said it had ""accepted the court's ruling"" and the ""government is committed to treating all detainees with dignity and respect"".
It said an independent review of welfare in detention had recently concluded and it would ""consider its findings and take action where appropriate""."

An accommodation centre for adults seeking asylum opened in Derby in February, but 17 wrongly-assessed children were sent there and had to be taken into care by social services.
Derby City Council's leader said the cost ""wasn't anticipated"".
The government said it had ""robust processes"" to handle age dispute cases.
The council said since G4S opened the centre in Laverstoke Court this year, 17 people - initially assessed as adults by the government - were found to be children travelling alone, meaning they had to be taken in by the council's social care service.
The authority estimated the cost of caring for the children at £600,000 a year.
Council leader Chris Poulter said the authority was not warned of the ""extra burden"" it would face when the centre opened or potential issues with age assessments.
""It's fair to say it wasn't anticipated,"" he said.
""Adult and children's social care budgets are already under significant pressures, so any level of increase in responsibilities and resources needed is a serious concern to us.""
The council said it was still waiting for a response from the Home Office to a request for additional funding.
A Home Office spokeswoman said staff were only able to treat an asylum claimant as an adult ""if their physical appearance and demeanour very strongly suggest they are significantly over 18"".
She said when there is a ""doubt"" about the claimant being a child, they are referred to a local authority, but added the government was ""reviewing the funding arrangements with councils"".

http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-34392909,asylum seeker,562,30 September 2015,None,Failed asylum seeker raped woman at Glasgow party,"A failed asylum seeker who raped a woman almost four years after he was ordered out of the UK has been jailed for four-and-a-half years.
Father-of-two Aly Donzo, 23, was convicted of raping a 20-year-old at a party in Glasgow on 30 May last year.
The High Court in Glasgow heard that the rape was committed in a flat in Plantation Park Gardens provided to Donzo by the Home Office.
During his trial Donzo denied rape and claimed the sex was consensual.
The victim told advocate depute Sheena Fraser, prosecuting, that she was at a party where Donzo, who comes from Guinea, was also present.
During the evening, as she came out the toilet, he grabbed her by the shoulders and pushed her towards a bedroom.
She said he had pushed her onto a bed and pulled down her trousers and underwear.
""I tried to push at his chest to get him off. But he was much bigger and stronger than me. I didn't want it to happen. I didn't want him to touch me. I said no,"" she said.
The woman told the court she just kept saying she wanted to go.
She told the court she pleaded with Donzo, telling him she had a boyfriend. After raping her Donzo got up and walked out the room.
Other partygoers said the woman was distressed when she came out of the bedroom.
Minutes later, as she left the house to get a taxi, Donzo called after her: ""See you later gorgeous.""
A taxi driver who picked her and a friend up from the flat where the rape took place described her as ""staring ahead expressionless"" and then ""crying like a wounded animal.""
The cabbie said the woman then started moaning and whimpering and added that her friend said she had just been raped.
The court heard that Donzo had entered the UK on 3 March 2010 and applied for asylum. He was served with papers on 20 March that year, stating he was in the country illegally.
On 15 April 2010 his application for asylum was refused and on 29 September that year further submissions to the Home Office were rejected.
On 7 October 2010 Donzo was told he had no further right of appeal and was told to leave the UK.
His defence team claimed he was ""hiding in plain sight"" all the time and the authorities could have easily found and deported him.
Defence advocate John McLaughlin told the court that Donzo still claimed that the sex was consensual and denied raping the woman.
Mr McLaughlin said: ""Mr Donzo operated in full view of the authorities. There has been nothing secretive or fly about his life.""
The advocate added: ""The flat which is the locus of the offence appears to have been provided by the Home Office.""
Donzo was also accused of raping another woman at another Glasgow flat on 2 January 2012, but this charge was withdrawn from the indictment after the alleged victim failed to turn up to give evidence.
Judge Lord Bonomy told Donzo: ""There is increasing public concern in Scotland about sexual offending. This was a serious assault on the personal integrity of your victim.""
He ordered Donzo to start his sentence at the end of a 32-month sentence he is currently serving for drugs offences.
Lord Bonomy also placed Donzo on the sex offenders' register."

Ioane Teitiota, 39, has argued that rising sea levels in his homeland meant his family would not be safe there.
His lawyer, Michael Kidd, told the BBC: ""He's very disappointed obviously, he wants to be back in New Zealand.""
Kiribati is among several low-lying Pacific nations threatened by climate change-linked problems.
These include storm surges, flooding and water contamination.
Mr Teitiota's wife and their three New Zealand-born children also face deportation and are likely to leave next week, reported local media.
""They said we are overstayers but we are not. We are trying to find a better life for the kids,"" his wife Angua Erika told Radio New Zealand.
Mr Teitiota's children are not entitled to New Zealand citizenship.
Mr Teitiota had been in New Zealand since 2007 but overstayed his visa and was caught in 2011.
His deportation on Wednesday night follows a failed appeal against a New Zealand high court decision that he could not be a refugee as he was not being persecuted. The United Nations describes a refugee as someone who faces persecution at home.
Mr Teitiota's appeal was dismissed in July. He was taken into police custody last week ahead of his deportation.
Mr Kidd said that Mr Teitiota was planning to appeal for help from the United Nations's refugee agency.
His lawyers have argued in court that he and his family would suffer harm if forced to return to Kiribati because of the combined pressures of over-population and rising sea levels, and that he would be ""persecuted passively"" by the circumstances there.
Prime Minister John Key said this week that Mr Teitiota had overstayed and that his argument lacked credibility."

Kent County Council (KCC) is caring for 720 unaccompanied children who have crossed the English Channel to Dover - up from 630 at the start of August.
The council is to reopen Appledore former reception centre near Cranbook to house about 40 boys aged 16 or 17.
It is also converting a disused care home in Whitstable for under 18s.
It comes as the Conservative MP for Tonbridge, Edenbridge and Malling added his voice to calls for the government to do more to help refugees and migrants entering Europe.
Tom Tugendhat tweeted: ""Our common humanity, demands action at home and abroad.""
The Red Cross, which works with young asylum seekers and refugees in Kent, said the ""overwhelming majority"" who arrived in Dover from migrant camps in Calais claimed asylum.
""I believe the numbers are around 95%,"" said spokesman Rhys Cutler.
Children under 14 who arrive in the UK alone are taken into foster care while older teenagers live in the community as cared-for children.
David Slater, chaplain for Eurotunnel and the Port of Dover said some young asylum seekers arrived in Calais after ""absolutely horrendous"" journeys.
""In some cases they are running away from wars, but frequently they are being sent by their family who have clubbed together to get the money to send them because they will then be potentially earning in Europe,"" he said.
""These are children who have got an awful lot of pressure on them.""
In July, KCC announced it was to convert the disused Ladesfield Care Home in Whitstable to house young migrants.
Now it has said it will also bring back into use the Appledore building at Swattenden outdoor education centre to help ease pressure on its children's services.
""We need extra capacity as it is not possible to predict the number of unaccompanied asylum-seeking children who will arrive at the border in need of our care,"" said Councillor Peter Oakford.
""Since June this year there has been an unprecedented increase in the number of arrivals.
""We have accommodated as many as is possible in our existing provision at Ashford but it reached full capacity several weeks ago.""
They say a picture is worth 1,000 words and the picture of a Syrian child's body washed up on the beach in Turkey seems to have galvanised the debate over whether the UK should take more asylum seekers.
Even Conservative MPs have stepped up the pressure on the government. The MP for Tonbridge and Malling Tom Tugendhat took to Twitter to say that he'd ""spoken to many in West Kent who want us to do more"" and he agreed with them. He also said our common humanity demands action at home and abroad.
The government's line has always been that they are at the forefront of the response to the Syrian crisis, but after growing calls for Britain to do more, the Prime Minister has now said that he felt deeply moved by the sight of that young boy on a beach in Turkey.
He said ""Britain is a moral nation and we will fulfil our moral responsibilities"" but he has stopped short of any commitments to taking refugees."

The 20-year-old was found dead on Tuesday morning near the refugee home in which he lived.
A post-mortem examination found he had died from wounds to the neck and chest.
An initial police statement reported no suspicious circumstances but a murder investigation was opened on Wednesday.
Volker Beck, a Green MP, accused the police force of negligence and amateurism.
Police have so far not commented on the case but prosecutors say they have assigned 25 detectives to investigate, Reuters news agency reports.
On Monday an estimated 25,000 protesters joined a march in the city organised by Pegida, a group campaigning against the influence of Islam in Europe.
The rallies began in October and have been growing in strength in recent weeks.

He takes part in a scheme offering work at his farm for a day.
""It is surprising how many farmers from different countries come and help you learn something,"" he said.
The visits are arranged by the Yorkshire Dales Millennium Trust charity.
The scheme has been running for 11 years and offers a ""small financial incentive"" to farmers.
Mr Beresford said: ""It is one of the best things I've done over the years for helping me. It genuinely makes a difference.
""I get some free labour for the day, which is pretty good because they do help a lot.""
Called the Darwen Asylum Seekers and Refugee Enterprise (DARE), the group includes people who have been in Britain for a few months and others who have been waiting to hear about their application to stay for years.

The 21-year-old suffered critical injuries after covering herself in fuel and setting herself alight.
Last week, a 23-year-old Iranian died after setting himself alight at the same facility.
Nauru is one of several off-shore detention centres for asylum seekers operated by Australia.
Human rights groups have strongly criticised Australia's policies towards asylum seekers.
Papua New Guinea last week announced it was closing a similar detention centre, at Manus Island, after its Supreme Court ruled it was illegal.
The young Somali woman is believed to have recently returned to Nauru, having been treated in Australia for injuries sustained in a motorcycle accident on the island, Refugee Action Coalition spokesman Ian Rintoul said.
She is reportedly being treated on the island for burn injuries, and a request for a transfer to Australia for medical treatment has been made.
Mr Rintoul was quoted by the Sydney Morning Herald as saying there was ""an epidemic of self-harm at Nauru"".
A 23-year-old man known as Omid died in a Brisbane hospital on Friday, four days after setting himself alight in what the Nauru authorities said was a ""political protest"".
Australia's Immigration Minister Peter Dutton has admitted there have been incidents of self-harm on the small Pacific island.
""What we've been very clear about is that if people come to Australia for medical assistance they'll be returning back to Nauru once that medical assistance has been provided,"" he said.
He has also suggested that some of the 850 detainees at Manus Island may be moved to Nauru. They will not be allowed to come to Australia, he has said."

The former Ladesfield Care Home in Whitstable is next to Joy Lane Primary School, a nursery and an Age UK centre.
Parents have expressed fears for the safety of children, while Canterbury city councillor Ashley Clark said the plan ""bordered on irresponsibility"".
Kent County Council said it had a duty of care towards unaccompanied children.
According to latest figures, there are 516 children currently in its care, compared to 238 children last year.
The centre would be used as temporary accommodation for boys aged 16 and 17 who have arrived in the UK on their own.
Some parents at the neighbouring school said they did not believe it was a good environment for their children.
""Can they justify putting vulnerable men who've been through traumatic experiences next to vulnerable children and the elderly?"" Joanna Smith asked.
Lee Oliver said he was not happy that his child would see ""barb-wired fences and security guards"".
The building is due to be knocked down in six months to allow the primary school to expand, and would only be used to house young asylum seekers as a temporary measure.
Julian Brazier, the Conservative MP for Canterbury and Whitstable, said he had spoken to Kent Police, who did not believe there was a threat.
""I do understand people's concerns and Ladesfield is clearly not suitable as a long-term centre,"" he said.
In a statement, the Home Office said the UK had a proud history of granting asylum to those who needed it, and it took its responsibility in cases involving children seriously."
http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-australia-33590499,asylum seeker,338,20 July 2015,None,Suspected asylum seeker boat sighted off West Australia,"A small wooden boat suspected to be carrying asylum seekers has been sighted off the north-west coast of Australia.
Crew working for oil and gas producer Modec spotted the boat within 500m of their floating oil tanker, about 150km (93 miles) from the Dampier coast.
A Modec spokesman said ""a large number of people"" appeared to be on the boat.
If confirmed as asylum seekers, it would be the first ""illegal"" vessel entry into Australia since June 2014.
At that time, 157 people were intercepted about 16 nautical miles from Australia's Christmas Island, in the Indian Ocean, and taken to the mainland.
Australia has adopted a number of measures to stop asylum seekers reaching Australia by boat.
Modec Australia country operations manager Gary Kennedy told the BBC the company had contacted Australian authorities about the boat, which appeared to be seaworthy.
Neither the Australian Maritime Authority nor Minister for Immigration Peter Dutton would comment.
Mr Kennedy said the boat, which looked like a fishing vessel, was spotted early on Monday, West Australian time.
""It came inside the exclusion zone [around the production facility], which is why we alerted authorities,"" Mr Kennedy told the BBC.
Modec staff told him the people did not seem to be under ""duress"", the vessel looked seaworthy, and the weather and sea conditions were not dangerous.
""The feedback [from staff] is that they appeared to be in high spirits,"" said Mr Kennedy.
He said he had been told the people were Vietnamese but that had not been confirmed.
Mr Kennedy said it was possible Modec would be asked to assist the boat but so far no such request from Australian authorities had been made.
The West Australian newspaper has reported that there may be children on board the boat.
Last month, migrants headed to Australia told the UN the crew on their boat was paid by the Australian navy to turn back to Indonesia.
At the time, Prime Minister Tony Abbott would say only that his government used ""creative strategies"" to stop migrant boats."

Single asylum-seekers without children will get an integration benefit of 5,945 kroner (£564) a month before tax, instead of the current 10,849.
Married couples with children will be able to get 16,638 kroner monthly, instead of the current 28,832.
Immigrants who pass a Danish language test will be entitled to a 1,500 kroner monthly bonus.
On Friday the proposal is expected to be passed by parliament, where the Venstre-led (Liberal) government is supported by the anti-immigration Danish People's Party (DPP).
The new integration benefit - replacing unemployment benefit for migrants - would then become law in September. EU migrant workers will not be affected by it.
Denmark has adopted some of the toughest immigration policies in the EU in recent years, as the DPP's political influence has grown.
First- and second-generation immigrants form 12% of Denmark's 5.6 million population.
""We must tighten up so we can get to grips with the asylum stream to Denmark,"" said Immigration Minister Inger Stoejberg, quoted by the Copenhagen Post.
In the run-up to last month's election, Venstre leader Lars Lokke Rasmussen - now prime minister - said action was needed ""so that the influx of asylum-seekers and people coming here through family reunification is brought under control"".
Separately, the government says more police and monitoring equipment will be installed at the border with Germany to stop smugglers and irregular migrants entering Denmark.
However, the measures would not violate the EU's Schengen rules on unrestricted travel, Foreign Minister Kristian Jensen said."

The 45-year-old woman and her son were flown back to Nigeria in January.
Last month, an immigration court said Theresa May had not considered the ""best interests"" of the boy, five.
Meanwhile, a chartered flight that would have returned 59 asylum seekers to Afghanistan was aborted after a last-minute court order.
An appeal from Mrs May's lawyers against the decision of the immigration court in the case of the mother and her son was rejected by Lord Justice McCombe.
He said it was ""impossible"" to conclude that the decision was ""wrong in principle"".
The appeal hearing in London was told that plans were in place to fly the pair back to London on Thursday.
The Nigerian woman was discovered working illegally in a shop in London using a false Dutch passport, in 2007.
She applied to stay in the UK and said she had been in the country since 1991, but her application was turned down.
The woman then claimed asylum in 2010, saying she feared persecution and ill-treatment in her home country.
By then, she had given birth to a son.
Her removal was secured and the pair left the UK.
But the Upper Immigration Tribunal ruled last month that the home secretary had failed to take into account the impact on the boy or mental health problems suffered by his mother, and the ""risk of that degenerating in the Nigerian context"".
The tribunal said Mrs May's decision was ""flawed"" because the boy's interests should have been a ""primary consideration"".
On Tuesday night, a Home Office flight that would have taken asylum seekers to Afghanistan was cancelled after lawyers for some of the men successfully argued the country was no longer safe.
The men would be at risk of ""serious harm"" if forcibly deported, they said."
http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-australia-32313865,asylum seeker,377,15 April 2015,None,Police called in for Darwin asylum-seeker 'disturbance',"Police in the northern Australian city of Darwin say they have attended to a ""disturbance"" at an asylum seeker centre, amid reports of ongoing detainee protests.
A rights group says the asylum seekers there are protesting against plans to transfer some of them to Nauru.
Australia has seen a number of protests among asylum seekers kept in detention centres in recent months.
Rights groups have heavily criticised conditions in such centres.
About 70 asylum seekers are blockading the Sun compound of the Wickham Point detention centre in a bid to prevent some of the inmates from being returned to Nauru, a statement from the Refugee Action Coalition said.
Many of the asylum seekers are families originally from Nauru who fear being returned, it added.
""We are just trying to help each other,"" one asylum seeker is quoted as telling the rights group.
The NGO says that personnel from the outsourcing company that runs Australia's immigration detention centres, Serco, have withdrawn from the compound.
But it says there are now fears that Serco could use its emergency response team to break the blockade.
A Northern Territories police spokeswoman said they had received calls at around 1540 local time (0710 BST) about a ""disturbance"" at Wickham Point. She declined to give further details.
Ben Pynt of the Darwin Asylum Seeker Support and Advocacy Network told the BBC that he has received calls from dozens of detainees about the protest and apparent cases of self-harm.
The group was originally housed in Nauru but were brought to Darwin for medical treatment.
""Nauru is not safe for asylum seekers or refugees. There are limited medical facilities, which is why so many people are being sent to the mainland for medical treatment,"" the Refugee Action Coalition warns.
Australia asylum: Why is it controversial?
Australia saw a lengthy protest by asylum seekers at Manus Island in Papua New Guinea in January, where hundreds reportedly went on hunger strike.
In February 2014, that same camp saw deadly riots where at least one asylum seeker was killed and at least 70 were injured.
In October, the Australian government ordered an inquiry into allegations that asylum seekers were abused in the Nauru detention centre.
It reported in March that there were ""credible"" claims of assault and harassment."
http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-28314836,asylum seeker,472,15 July 2014,None,Asylum seeker benefits fraud 'not being tackled',"The Home Office has come under fire for failing to stop asylum seekers fraudulently claiming benefits.
In a scathing report, Independent Chief Inspector of Borders and Immigration John Vine said there was ""no evidence"" of an effective strategy to fight fraud in the £155m asylum support system.
He said insufficient resources also meant that opportunities to find and deter those planning fraud were lost.
The Home Office has insisted work has already begun to improve these areas.
It said its efforts would help streamline the asylum process across the country.
The Home Office also accepted 11 recommendations made in the report and pledged to implement them.
People applying for asylum in the UK are entitled to housing and financial support of at least £36 a week. Those whose asylum claims have been refused are also eligible for short-term benefits.
In total, almost 27,000 people received support last year.
However, the report found that only six people were successfully prosecuted in the UK in 2012/13 for fraud offences in this area and that only £5,673 was recovered.
Mr Vine said these figures were ""far too low"".
""I found no evidence that the Home Office had an effective strategy to identify and tackle fraud in the asylum support system,"" he said.
""Work had not been undertaken to determine what its exposure to fraud risk was.
""No attempt had been made to ensure that fraud and compliance teams operated in a consistent manner and there were insufficient resources dedicated to this work.
""This meant that opportunities to identify and deter those wishing to commit fraud were lost.""
The report said the Home Office's UK Visas and Immigration (UKVI) failed to follow its own policy of reviewing support cases to determine whether recipients were still eligible.
More than half had not been reviewed regularly, it found.
The report also said the UKVI failed to establish ""an effective counter-fraud regime"" and had not determined the ""scale and nature"" of risks posed by fraud.
Resource management was therefore ""haphazard"" and regional teams worked autonomously without any central guidance.
The report said this led to them failing to operate in a consistent manner, setting their own performance targets and not being suitably trained to do investigative work.
In a statement, the Home Office said it was ""committed to providing accommodation and support to those who would otherwise be destitute while claims are considered"".
""UKVI's security objective is to detect and deter threats and identify, protect and support victims as part of a zero tolerance approach to immigration abuse,"" it said.
It added that it was pleased with the positive findings in the report, which included remarks that staff working at an asylum screening unit were ""committed to safeguarding vulnerable individuals and made a concerted effort to ensure that those requiring immediate access to the support system were given priority""."
https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-45419445,asylum seeker,592,5 September 2018,None,Amsterdam attack: Jihadist knifeman shot in nine seconds,"A 19-year-old Afghan who stabbed two American tourists in Amsterdam was shot just nine seconds after he launched his attack, the city's police chief has revealed.
Commissioner Pieter-Jaap Aalbersberg said a special ""spotter"" had been watching the suspect when he pulled out a knife at Amsterdam's central station.
Moments later teenager Jawed S was shot in the hip, he said.
The suspect's lawyer has revealed the man had expected to die in the attack.
Jawed S, an asylum seeker who arrived in Germany in 2015, had travelled by train to Amsterdam on Friday. The German authorities say they were tipped off in February that he had become radicalised while living at a youth facility.
""My client appears to have made the assumption that he wasn't going to survive his attack, because a will was found at his home in Germany,"" said lawyer Simon van der Woude.
He believed the teenager had been acting in response to a cartoon competition proposed by anti-Islam politician Geert Wilders, as well as an earlier video involving the Prophet Muhammad.
Dutch prosecutors said this week that Jawed S had had a ""terrorist motive"" and had been ""of the opinion that in the Netherlands the Prophet Muhammad, Islam and the Koran were insulted"".
Mr Wilders had cancelled the competition the day before the attack but Mr Van der Woude said his client did not appear to know.
In a statement on Wednesday the two victims of the attack thanked Dutch police and praised hospital staff for delivering ""life altering news as gently as possible"".
The Amsterdam police chief told Dutch TV that Jawed S had got off a train shortly before midday on Friday and a few minutes afterwards his ""abnormal behaviour"" had come to the notice of a member of a team of public transport police trained to spot pickpockets as well as potential terrorists.
""He called two colleagues over,"" said Mr Aalbersberg. ""While they are working out how to go and talk to him, they see he starts stabbing.""
One of the tourists was stabbed in the back at a kiosk before a second was attacked.
The police, who were by now 20m (65ft) away, drew their weapons. As Jawed S ran towards another potential victim, an officer opened fire and brought him down.
Within minutes, police had looked through CCTV images and determined that the man had been acting on his own.
""There were two victims and that is very serious, but the number was kept to a minimum,"" the commissioner said.
""Within nine seconds it was over and the officers made the difference during one precise moment,"" he added, stressing that they had saved lives.
The attacker was apparently unaware his victims were Americans. US ambassador Pete Hoekstra told Dutch TV late on Tuesday that it was an ""attack on Western values"".
Police say the central station in Amsterdam has long been identified as a potential target for attack and that they have a permanent team on duty.
They adapted an Israeli approach called ""predictive profiling"" whereby a suspect can be identified through suspicious patterns of behaviour.
""First of all a spotter assesses what behaviour is normal in a particular place,"" police trainer Geoffrey Rijtslag told the Volkskrant newspaper.
Anyone who deviated from that or started hanging around aimlessly was considered abnormal. At that point they would be approached by at least two officers.
The Amsterdam police chief said there were other indicators that spotters would consider too. Anyone who was waiting for a train would normally be expected to look at departure boards."
https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-45395136,asylum seeker,592,4 September 2018,None,Dutch asylum row: Armenian children face expulsion,"Two Armenian children who have spent most of their lives in the Netherlands face imminent deportation after emerging from hiding following a failed asylum plea.
Howick, 13, and his sister Lily, 12, came to the Netherlands with their mother in 2008.
Their mother was deported last year and the children's friends have rallied around them, calling for them to stay.
However, the Dutch government insists its asylum policy is fair.
Prime Minister Mark Rutte said last week he understood the emotion surrounding the case but asylum numbers had to be kept under control. ""Anyone who doesn't fall under the criteria cannot stay here,"" he said.
Their mother, 37-year-old Armina Hambartsjumian, applied for asylum shortly after arriving in the Netherlands in 2008 from Russia. The children have never lived in Armenia and barely speak the language.
When their mother was deported in 2017, she sent the children to a secret address before they were found by authorities. They have since been living with a family who had befriended their mother.
For months, the courts considered the children's case, with campaigners arguing their mother was mentally and physically incapable of looking after them and that the children would go to an orphanage.
Protests were held in support of the children by classmates from the city of Amersfoort and the case has become a cause celebre across the Netherlands.
After a series of asylum rulings, a final decision was made last month that there were no grounds for Lily and Howick to stay. Armenia was a safe country and there was no risk of persecution, the Council of State concluded.
The children would not end up on the street, it decided, and deportation was due to take place on 8 September.
In a recent letter to Dutch newspaper Algemeen Dagblad, the children's mother said they were ""in hiding"" and in a ""safe place"".
""The stress is so high that I'm scared my children will break down if this goes ahead,"" she wrote, adding that she had been told by professionals that they were suffering from post traumatic stress disorder.
But on Monday, the newspaper reported that the children had emerged from three days of hiding and reported to authorities.
The Dutch immigration service told the newspaper that it would not go into individual cases.
Appearing on a talk show on Dutch TV on Saturday, the children said they had been really shocked by news of their imminent deportation.
""We belong here. They say you're going back to Armenia but where am I going back to?"" said Lily.
""If we do end up there, we'll go into some sort of orphanage meant for a maximum of 20 children, but which already houses 30,"" Howick added.
Several European countries have struggled with the deportation of children whose asylum cases have been rejected.
Campaign group Defence for Children said they were still hoping that the Dutch migration secretary would overrule the court decision. They say there are 400 cases of children seeking asylum who have lived in the Netherlands for more than five years without a residence permit.
There were protests in the Dutch town of Culemborg last month when a Ukrainian family, whose three children were born in the Netherlands, were deported after living there for 17 years.
The Dutch immigration service turned down just over half of the 16,785 asylum applications made in 2017.
The largest number of rejections was from citizens of Morocco and Algeria.
While tens of thousands of unaccompanied minors entered Germany in 2015 and 2016, almost 90% of asylum claims were successful."
http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-26956544,asylum seeker,437,9 April 2014,None,Theresa May defeated over asylum seeker benefits,"The home secretary has lost a High Court battle over the financial support given to the poorest asylum seekers while their claims are being processed.
A coalition led by Refugee Action said it was unacceptable that the amount of money - about £36 a week for a single adult - had been frozen since 2011.
The court agreed, ruling that Theresa May had not acted ""rationally"".
The Home Office said it was ""disappointed"" at the decision and was considering launching an appeal.
The court ordered Mrs May to reach a new decision on the level of support by 9 August.
Campaigners compared the freeze on payments to destitute asylum seekers with income support, which has been increased in line with living costs each year since 2011.
Income support is currently £57.35 a week for a single person aged 16-24 without dependants, and £72.40 a week for those aged 25 or over.
Refugee Action said the ""cripplingly low level of financial support"" for asylum seekers had affected more than 23,000 people and left half of those it had spoken to without enough money to feed themselves or their families.
Mr Justice Popplewell said the decision to freeze rates for a third year in a row in 2013-14 amounted to ""a reduction in real terms from what was regarded in 2007 as the bare minimum level necessary to avoid destitution"".
He ruled the decision legally flawed, adding: ""In my judgment, the information used by the Secretary of State to set the rate of asylum support was simply insufficient to reach a rational decision to freeze rates.""
Refugee Action chief executive Dave Garratt said: ""Every day at Refugee Action we see the human impact of this unlawful Home Office policy which robs individuals and families of their dignity.
""While we are hugely heartened by today's judgment, we urgently need to see the Home Office acting on this ground-breaking ruling by setting up a transparent and robust enquiry into the way asylum support rates are calculated.""
Freedom from Torture chief executive Keith Best said ""decent financial support"" was ""vital to torture survivors being able to rebuild their lives in the UK"".
A Home Office spokesman said: ""We are disappointed with the court's judgement. We are looking at all options, including appealing.""
The Home Office pointed out that the judgement did not say payments were too low, but rather that there were errors in the way current levels had been set.
Increasing them could encourage spurious asylum claims which could clog up the system and make it harder for those with a genuine fear of persecution from receiving vital support, it added."

The renovated buildings were empty when the fires took hold on Thursday night. Firefighters quickly put out the blazes and no-one was seriously hurt.
Swastikas were daubed on one building with the slogan ""no asylum seeker in Vorra"" - the town where it happened.
Germany hosts more asylum seekers than any other country.
Local authorities have been struggling to accommodate rising numbers of them, many of whom have fled the wars in Syria and Iraq.
Police in Vorra estimate the fire damage at 700,000 euros (£555,000; $872,000). The three buildings were a former restaurant, a barn and a vacant block of flats.
Bavaria's Interior Minister Joachim Herrmann, of the conservative CSU party, said it was ""obviously arson"".
""And these swastika graffiti raise suspicions that far-right activists could have been responsible,"" he added.
Vorra's Mayor Volker Herzog - from the Social Democrats (SPD) - said the activists were suspected of having met at a local house at weekends, though there was no pattern of far-right offences.
Bavaria's Prime Minister Horst Seehofer (CSU) said Bavaria ""is distinguished by its citizens' willingness to help and support those who seek peaceful refuge in Bavaria and protection from war and persecution""."

She was previously flown from the island to Australia to have an abortion, but was flown back without having had it, a few days later.
Authorities said she changed her mind about the procedure, but the woman, known as Abyan, denied this.
Australia refuses to accept refugees attempting to reach it by boat.
They are kept in camps in Nauru and Papua New Guinea while their claims are processed. Even those found to be genuine refugees are resettled outside Australia.
Abortion is legal but heavily restricted on both Nauru and Papua New Guinea, hence the need for the woman to fly to Australia.
Earlier on Wednesday, the United Nations urged Australia to provide ""a decent option"" for the woman, who it said was ""in a very fragile mental and physical condition"". The Australian government says it will provide counselling when she is in the country, though it declined to be specific on when that might be.
Abyan's lawyers said she was returned to Nauru the first time just for wanting counselling and more time to make up her mind, not because she had decided against an abortion. The head of the Australian Human Rights Commission described the case as ""extraordinary"".
It comes as the Philippines says it will not accept refugees sent by Australia unless they are only there temporarily.
President Benigno Aquino, responding to an Australian proposal to resettle refugees in the country, pointed out that his country was far more populous than Australia and had difficulties providing for its own population.
Australia is one of the world's richest countries, whereas roughly a quarter of the Philippines' approximately 100 million people live in deep poverty.
Mr Aquino also noted that after the Philippines agreed to host Vietnam War refugees temporarily in the 1970s, hundreds of thousands ended up staying for many years.
Australia currently has an multi-million dollar agreement with another developing nation, Cambodia, to resettle refugees there. But so far only four have made the move, despite offers of cash and free accommodation."

Nemah Shehadeh, 60, was held after an attempt to deport her to Jordan failed in January 2008 when she claimed to be a stateless Palestinian.
A judge previously ruled she had been unlawfully detained from 2008 to 2009.
Three appeal judges upheld that ruling saying the authorities had breached the legal principles that govern detention.
The court heard how Ms Shehadeh previously lived in Saudi Arabia with her husband, from whom she is now separated.
She was issued with a six-month visitor visa to come to Britain on the basis that she was a Jordanian citizen and arrived in August 2002 but overstayed.
Ms Shehadeh was arrested in 2005 at London's Heathrow airport with her as they were attempting to use false French passports to travel to Canada.
She was subsequently convicted of using a false passport at Hillingdon Magistrates Court and sentenced to four months imprisonment with a recommendation for her deportation.
Following her release, Ms Shehadeh was neither detained nor deported and went on to make an asylum claim which was rejected in 2007.
In January 2008, she was flown to Jordan but on arrival told immigration officials that she was Palestinian and as a result was refused entry to the country.
In July of that year, the Jordanian embassy told Home Office officials that Ms Shehadeh was not one of their citizens and had only been issued with a temporary travel document by the country's authorities.
It was then proposed that Ms Shehadeh be detained while her case was considered. This involved detention for 12 months from August 2008.
After her release in 2009, Ms Shehadeh brought a case against immigration officials at the Court of Session in Edinburgh for wrongful detention.
Lord Tyre awarded her damages and said: ""There has never been any suggestion that she posed any risk to the public if at liberty.
""As regards risk of absconding, I accept the submission that this was significantly, and sometimes grossly, overstated in the monthly detention reviews.""
Following that decision, an appeal was lodged on behalf of Home Secretary Theresa May.
But Lord Drummond Young, sitting with Lady Dorrian and Lord Philip, said that Lord Tyre was ""fully justified"" in concluding that from August 2008 onwards the immigration authorities were ""in breach of legal principles that govern the lawfulness of detention in such circumstances"".
""The petitioner's detention for the following year accordingly amounted to the delict of wrongful imprisonment, for which she is entitled to payment of damages,"" said Lord Drummond Young.
Ms Shehadeh, considers herself to be a stateless Palestinian, although the Home Secretary regards her as a Jordanian national, judges heard.
She was born in 1954 in the West Bank which was part of Jordan at the time."

Ministers want them to use mainstream NHS services, but admit ""a model of care to facilitate and support integration, or to ensure public health issues are addressed, may initially be appropriate"".
Dr Quinney, a locum GP who has worked at the Cardiff Health Access Practice (CHAP), said it was designed to respond to the needs of newly-arrived asylum seekers, with Iran, Afghanistan and Syria among the main countries of origin.
She said problems arose because they are encouraged to register with a general practice as soon as they are sent to Cardiff by the Home Office.
""They struggle to be understood, they don't understand how the appointments systems work, they find it very difficult to get to the appointment in time, they can't cope with the 10-minute appointment system because there's a language barrier,"" she said.
Dr Quinney, who also works in mainstream GP practices, said CHAP can offer refugees and asylum seekers longer and more flexible appointments, and more support for conditions such as post-traumatic stress disorder.
""Usually there's a delay in the onset of these symptoms - nightmares, flashbacks and extreme anxiety - of around three months after the initial trauma in their home country.
""It's compounded by social isolation - living in Cardiff and not being able to work makes these symptoms worse.""
The role of CHAP has been expanded to include non-medical activities such as reflexology, birth partners and gym projects offered by volunteers.
Dr Quinney said these were not standard GP services, but claimed they were ""critical"" to helping asylum seekers cope on arrival.
Estelle Tije, 33, from Cameroon, had completed a master's degree in nursing in London when she heard her father had been killed during political turmoil in her home country.
She applied for asylum in November when her student visa expired and was sent by the Home Office to Cardiff.
Ms Tije paid tribute to Dr Quinney and the CHAP team for helping her cope with life in an unfamiliar city without resorting to pills and prescriptions.
""I went through a lot of stress - she really helped me by sending me to the gym,"" she said.
""I didn't want medication - I'm a nurse so I understand each medicine has a side effect.
""But through the gym I managed a coping mechanism to overcome that stress.""
The Welsh Government said GPs were able to refer to specialist mental health services, with £40,000 provided in 2017 specifically to train staff in trauma-focused care for refugees and asylum seekers.
A spokesman said: ""Since we published our original guidance in 2009 we have seen significant changes as a result of increasing conflict in the middle and near east.
""Our latest draft guidance provides an update and will support healthcare professionals working with refugees and asylum seekers.""
Dr Jane Fenton-May, vice-chairwoman of the Royal College of General Practitioners Wales, said: ""All staff working in a practice should be aware of the cultural needs of any patient and accessible training and support could help improve that.
""How to best achieve this when GPs are facing severe workload pressures will need to be considered."""
http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-australia-29625556,asylum seeker,603,15 October 2014,None,Asylum seeker baby born in Australia denied refugee visa,"A federal court has ruled that a baby born in Australia to an asylum seeker is not entitled to a refugee visa.
Ferouz Myuddin, who is 11 months old, was born in Brisbane when his mother was transferred to hospital from a refugee detention centre on Nauru.
A judge backed the government's earlier ruling that the baby was an ""unauthorised maritime arrival"" so could not claim refugee status.
Lawyers said he and 100 similar babies could now be sent to Nauru.
The hearing comes as the federal government considers amending the Migration Act to retrospectively declare all babies born to asylum seekers who arrive by boat as unauthorised maritime arrivals, irrespective of whether they were born on Australian soil.
If the amendments are passed, babies born to asylum seeker parents in Australia will have no right to apply for a permanent protection visa and should be transferred offshore.
Ferouz's family are Muslim Rohingyas who said they fled to Myanmar (also known as Burma) to escape persecution.
They landed on Australian territory in September last year and were taken to the off-shore processing centre in Nauru. Ferouz was born prematurely after his mother was taken to hospital in Brisbane because of concerns over her pregnancy.
Immigration Minister Scott Morrison had previously denied Ferouz a protection visa - which allows refugees to live permanently in Australia - on the basis that he had arrived on Australian territory by sea illegally.
Australia asylum: Why is it controversial?
His parents then appealed to the Federal Court but after examining how the family had entered Australia, Judge Michael Jarrett backed the government view.
He said the rule was intended to discourage people smugglers.
Lawyer Murray Watt said he was advising the Myuddin family, currently staying in a detention centre in Darwin, to appeal.
""This is a ludicrous decision given he was born here in Brisbane's Mater Hospital and he even has a Queensland birth certificate,"" ABC News quoted him as saying.
He said his firm - which is representing the families of 100 babies born in Australia to asylum seekers who arrived by boat - would be seeking assurance from the government that the families will not be moved to Nauru until the appeal is heard.
Mr Morrison welcomed the ruling, saying it has ""always been the intention of successive governments that children born to illegal maritime arrivals, are taken to have the same status as their parents,"" ABC News reports.
Ferouz's family are also applying for citizenship for him as a ""stateless"" migrant, saying that as a Rohingya he is denied citizenship in Myanmar.
Children born in Australia to non-citizens or non-permanent residents can automatically get citizenship but only once they turn 10 and have spent most of their life in Australia.
Australia has been clamping down on asylum seekers, particularly those who arrive by boat.
Last month Australia signed a controversial deal with Cambodia to resettle refugees in the South East Asian nation. It also reintroduced temporary visas for refugees, which allow for the refugees to be sent home after a period of time if conditions in their home country are judged to have improved.
Australia's High Court is also hearing a separate challenge over 157 asylum seekers from Sri Lanka who set out from southern India and were intercepted by Australia security in July.
They were held on a customs ship at sea for a month, initially in secret, Their lawyers argued they were illegally detained, but government lawyers said the decision was made under existing laws.
The court on Wednesday said it was reserving its decision, with a ruling not expected for some time."

Roza Salih, has helped to obtain scholarship funding for three places.
She was one of seven Glasgow schoolgirls who campaigned against dawn raids by immigration officials in Drumchapel in 2005.
Their story has subsequently been made into a musical and film.
Ms Salih, whose family came to Glasgow from Iraqi Kurdistan, is now Vice President Diversity & Advocacy of the University of Strathclyde Students' Association (USSA),
She said: ""I'm absolutely thrilled that the University of Strathclyde has agreed to help three asylum seekers to access higher education.
""This will create life-changing opportunities for those whose talents might otherwise have been wasted.
""It is, however, unfortunate that we have to take such measures, when the real cause of the problem is an immigration policy which effectively obstructs asylum seekers from higher education and this is an issue I will continue to campaign on.""
USSA said it was very difficult for asylum seekers to study in Scotland due to prohibitive fees and the fact many are not allowed to work.
The scholarship funding was secured with the help of the Scottish Refugee Council.
Elodie Mignard, Integration Development Officer at the council, added: ""When people come to Scotland seeking safety and protection from persecution they bring a wealth of skills, talent and experience with them.
""We welcome the University's proactive stance in supporting asylum seekers to develop these skills further."""

Damian Collins MP, who represents Folkestone and Hythe, said he was told this by the minister in charge of asylum, James Brokenshire.
He said he was reassured the asylum seekers would move within two weeks.
They arrived at the Grand Burstin hotel after complaints that 600 migrants were crammed into a South London hotel.
In his blog, Mr Collins wrote: ""The minister has made clear that the asylum seekers will not have access to local services whilst they are staying in Folkestone.
""Any that need urgent health care will be moved to an asylum seeker centre to receive it, rather than being treated here.
""Their subsistence will be covered by the Home Office, and our local councils will not be asked to provide any support to them.""
He added: ""The decision to bring the asylum seekers to Folkestone was not made by government ministers, but by contractors who work for the Home Office who made the booking directly with the owners of the Burstin hotel.""
Of the 130 migrants who came to the hotel, 30 have already left, he said."

Sameer Neelam, who was born female but lived in secret as a male, said he suffered violence and harassment after being ""outed"" by the Indian media.
He sought asylum in Bradford, but now faces being returned to India where he fears he will have to live as a woman.
The Home Office said it could not comment on active legal proceedings.
Speaking to BBC Look North Mr Neelam said: ""Here I'm considered as what I am. In India I can't dress like this. Nobody counts me as a man.
""If I open myself as a man in India I will be looked down on, tortured, discriminated, eliminated.""
Mr Neelam was a prominent local official in Hyderabad, in India, but in private he lived as a man with another woman. He has not undergone surgical procedures.
He said after his double life was uncovered he wanted to kill himself, but since moving to the UK he had been able to live openly as a man.
""I can't even get a job if I started living as a man there,"" he said.
""I'm enjoying my life as a man and if somebody calls me 'Mr' or says 'he' I feel energetic.""
Stephen Whittle, professor of equalities law at Manchester Metropolitan University who went through transition from female to male in 1975, said Mr Neelam's story was uncommon.
He said: ""It's quite an unusual situation in the sense that we do not often get people making it all the way to the UK to apply for asylum
""For many transgender people in their home countries life is just very hard.
""In fact inevitably they do not ever manage to transition and have their gender reassigned. It's as it was here 40 to 50 years ago.
""I can see in Sameer's story very much a reflection of the story of what it was like in England [when I transitioned in 1975] but of course we've moved on so much more and the rest of the world is still lagging behind and has to be dragged along.""
According to government guidelines on asylum applications from transsexuals an applicant ""may claim asylum when he or she fears persecution on account of his or her actual or perceived gender identity which does not, or is deemed not to, conform to prevailing political, social or cultural norms in his or her country of origin.""
A spokesperson for the Home Office said: ""The UK has a proud history of granting asylum to those who need it and applications are carefully considered before a decision is made.
""It would be inappropriate to comment further while legal proceedings are ongoing.""
Mr Neelam is expected to find out whether he will be deported in the coming days."

Activists said Hamid Khazaei, 24, cut his foot while at Australia's camp on Papua New Guinea's Manus Island.
The cut became infected and led to septicaemia, which caused a heart attack, they say.
Ian Rintoul of the Refugee Action Coalition confirmed news of Mr Khazaei's death to the BBC.
Australia's immigration minister defended the medical care he received when he was declared brain dead.
""When someone becomes ill, they receive outstanding care from the people who work as part of our mainland detention network and in the offshore processing centres,"" Scott Morrisson said.
He said he had asked the immigration department's chief medical officer to review the man's clinical treatment.
But Mr Rintoul has blamed conditions in the camp for Mr Khazaei's infection, saying detainees sometimes had to walk through raw sewage overflows caused by hosing out blocked toilets and by high tides.
Greens Senator Sarah Hanson-Young says there was a delay in providing adequate care to Mr Khazaei - a claim echoed by Mr Rintoul, who described the Manus Island camp as ""unhygienic hell-hole that must be closed"".
Mr Morrison said such claims ""have not been based on any primary knowledge of this case"". He accused critics of using the case ""to make political points"".
Australia detains all those who arrive by boat to seek asylum. They are held in offshore camps in PNG, Nauru and on Christmas Island.
Both the UN and NGOs have strongly criticised conditions in these camps.
Earlier this year, an Iranian man was killed in a beating by - according to an official report - a mob of security guards and PNG local residents who had broken in to the Manus Island camp during a night of violence.
Detainees on Christmas Island, meanwhile, are currently suing the Australian government over allegedly inadequate medical care.
The government says its tough policies are aimed at ending the flow of boats, so that no more people die making the dangerous journey to Australia."

Hamid Khazaei, 24, had been in a detention centre on Manus Island in Papua New Guinea.
The Iranian was transferred to the mainland for treatment last week but had a heart attack, the activist said.
Mr Khazaei's case follows the death of another Iranian in violence at the same centre in February.
According to the Refugee Action Coalition, Mr Khazaei cut his foot about two weeks ago. Spokesman Ian Rintoul told the BBC that the wound was very small, but got infected quickly.
Mr Khazaei sought medical attention a number of times, and by the time he received it ""he had to be helped to walk"", said Mr Rintoul.
He was transferred to a hospital in Brisbane last Wednesday, where he subsequently suffered a heart attack.
His family were informed that he had become brain dead on Tuesday, the activist said.
The hospital would appoint a guardian to decide whether life support should be withdrawn, he said, with the young man's family unlikely to visit because of the airfare cost.
Greens Senator Sarah Hanson-Young claimed there was a delay in transferring Mr Khazaei to the hospital because a request from the medical service provider was denied, reported Fairfax Media.
Mr Rintoul linked Mr Khazaei's case to poor hygiene at the Manus Island camp.
""Skin and fungal infections are endemic. The toilets are often blocked and have to be hosed out, so sewage gets on the floor. If the tide is high, the raw sewage also comes back up,"" he said.
A spokesman for Australia's Immigration Minister Scott Morrison said: ""The individual has not died. In respect to the family of the individual, further details are not able to be provided.""
The spokesman added that the government was following ""normal processes"" and had engaged his family.
The immigration department said last week that its chief medical officer was reviewing the background to Mr Khazaei's condition and medical care while he was at Manus Island.
In February, an outbreak of violence at the centre left several people injured and one dead.
A report on the incident later found that Reza Barati had been brutally beaten by both security staff and PNG local residents who had entered the centre.
In recent months, the Australian government has come under increased scrutiny for its treatment of asylum seekers who arrive by boat.
Australia detains all those who arrive by boat to seek asylum. Detainees are held on Christmas Island and in camps in Papua New Guinea (PNG) and Nauru. The UN and rights groups have strongly condemned conditions in these offshore camps.
The government says its tough asylum policies are intended to save lives by stopping people getting on dangerous boats to make the journey to Australia."
https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-australia-45312707,asylum seeker,590,26 August 2018,None,Julie Bishop resigns as Australia's foreign minister,"Australia's Foreign Minister Julie Bishop has announced her resignation from the cabinet.
Her move came as new Prime Minister Scott Morrison named his cabinet after winning a bruising leadership contest on Friday.
Ms Bishop said she had not yet decided whether to stand at the next general election, due in 2019.
She had sought the prime minister's job after Malcolm Turnbull stood aside, but was eliminated in the first round.
WhatsApp group chat messages leaked to Australian television network ABC show Liberal Party colleagues tactically voted against her to stop a victory for Peter Dutton, a conservative and former home affairs minister.
The leadership fight also ended her 11-year tenure as deputy leader of the party.
The 62-year-old from Western Australia has been a federal politician for two decades.
""I will remain on the backbench as a strong voice for Western Australia,"" she said.
Mr Morrison announced on Sunday that Marise Payne would replace Ms Bishop as foreign minister, while Mr Dutton gets his old job back at home affairs.
Last week's leadership crisis arose after Mr Turnbull came under pressure from poor polling and what he described as an ""insurgency"" by conservative MPs.
The Liberal-National coalition government has only a one-seat majority in parliament, and Labor is ahead in opinion polls, with an election to be held at some point before May 2019.
Mr Dutton had unsuccessfully challenged Mr Turnbull on Tuesday, but his narrow defeat only stoked further discord.
Mr Morrison, the treasurer, entered the race later in the week after Mr Turnbull lost key backers.
He won the second round of Friday's internal Liberal Party ballot by 45-40 over Mr Dutton - who had been Mr Turnbull's most vocal threat. Ms Bishop had been eliminated in a first round of voting.
Mr Turnbull has signalled he will resign from parliament, which would force a by-election and potentially put the government's one-seat majority at risk and force the new premier to call early elections.
A former Tourism Australia official, Scott Morrison entered parliament in 2007 and has since held three key ministerial portfolios. As immigration minister, he drew criticism over the controversial asylum seeker policies and offshore detention centres.
Speaking to reporters after the vote on Friday, Mr Morrison said he would be working to ""bring our party back together which has been bruised and battered this week"" and bring the country together.
He also said dealing with a severe drought, which has hit parts of eastern Australia, would be ""our most urgent and pressing need right now"".
The past decade has been marked by a series of leadership coups, with three other sitting prime ministers deposed by party rivals.
Not a single leader in recent times has succeeded in serving a full term as prime minister, partly because elections come around so often - every three years - two years less than in the UK.
So in recent years, prime ministers unpopular in the polls - or with their colleagues - have been swiftly sacrificed from within.
Dave Sharma, a former Australian diplomat, says ""an election is always just around the corner, meaning members of parliament are forever focused on their electoral survival - and less so on the national interest"".
Writing in the Sydney Morning Herald, Mr Sharma says ""the steady drip of opinion polls and the relentless media cycle exacerbates the short-termism"".
Under the Australian system, as in the UK, the prime minister is not directly elected by voters but is the leader of the party or coalition that can command a majority in parliament."

The move to cut ties with Australia's High Court means the Pacific island now has no appeal system of its own.
Nauru says it will establish its own local court of appeal instead.
The tiny island nation hosts a controversial Australian offshore detention centre where hundreds of asylum seekers are currently held.
Under its policy, Australia refuses to take in anyone trying to reach its territories unofficially by boat. They are intercepted and detained either in detention centres on Nauru or Manus Island in Papua New Guinea.
Nauru's highest court is its Supreme Court but since an agreement in 1976 the High Court of Australia has been the final court of appeal for those on the island.
Critics say that abolishing this could have a negative impact for the asylum seekers on Nauru.
""Asylum seekers could [previously] appeal adverse decisions about their refugee status through the High Court of Australia,"" George Newhouse, an Australian human rights lawyer, told AFP news agency.
""Without an independent right of appeal, asylum seekers are at risk of being returned to harm or even death.""
The Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade confirmed on Sunday that the agreement between Nauru and Australia had already been terminated on the 12 March.
Last month Nauru's president Baron Waqa called for the country to cut links with Australia's high court, saying it would prove the country's ""maturity"".
""The establishment of a final appellate court can be regarded as an affirmation of Nauru's sovereignty, independence and maturity as a nation,"" he told parliament.
""Severance of ties to Australia's highest court is a logical step towards full nationhood.""
Allegations of human rights abuses and overcrowding has plagued Australia's detention centre in Nauru for years.
In 2017, the Australian government said 1,162 asylum seekers who had arrived by boat were living in the Manus Island and Nauru detention centres."

MSF says that for 11 months it has provided mental health care to both the Nauru population and asylum seekers housed in a detention centre set up by Australia.
The charity has urged the Nauru government to reconsider, calling its own work life-saving.
The authorities have not commented.
The detention centre on Nauru was set up by Australia in a controversial deal to house boat people intercepted while trying to reach Australian shores.
Canberra maintains its policy prevents deaths at sea and discourages people smugglers but the tough immigration policy has been widely criticised.
The centre on Nauru has been dogged by allegations of widespread abuse and trauma among children and women. The president of the Australian Medical Association, Tony Bartone, recently described the situation for children there as ""a humanitarian emergency requiring urgent intervention"".
""The Nauruan government informed Médecins Sans Frontières/Doctors Without Borders that our services were 'no longer required' and requested that our activities cease within 24 hours,"" an MSF statement said.
The charity said it was ""extremely concerned that the health of our patients may be affected by this decision and urge the authorities to grant us permission to continue our lifesaving work"".
Earlier this year, a group of human rights organisations demanded the Australian government remove all child asylum seekers held on Nauru.
The coalition of more than 30 charities and advocacy groups, including World Vision Australia and Oxfam Australia, wants all children moved to Australia or settled in a safe country elsewhere.
Chief executive of World Vision Australia Claire Rogers said the children on Nauru had ""no hope"".
""Many of them have lived for years in tents, they have been separated from close family members and have no safe place to play or access to acceptable medical care.""
""The clock is ticking. This harmful, secretive and dysfunctional system of indefinite detention must end,"" Ms Rogers said."
http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-23782329,asylum seeker,584,21 August 2013,None,Asylum seeker awarded wrongful detention compensation,"An asylum seeker has been awarded £36,000 damages against the UK government for wrongful detention.
Nemah Shehadeh, who lives in Glasgow, was held after an attempt to deport her to Jordan failed in January 2008 when she claimed to be a Palestinian.
A judge at the Court of Session in Edinburgh has now ruled that the 58-year-old was unlawfully detained for one year from August 2008.
Lord Tyre said the sum awarded was ""appropriate compensation"".
The court heard how Shehadeh previously lived in Saudi Arabia with a husband, from whom she is now separated.
She was issued with a six-month visitor visa to come to Britain on the basis that she was a Jordanian citizen and arrived in August 2002 but overstayed.
Shehadeh was arrested in 2005 at London's Heathrow airport with a son when they were attempting to use false French passports to travel to Canada.
She was subsequently convicted of using a false passport at Hillingdon Magistrates Court and sentenced to four months imprisonment with a recommendation for her deportation.
Following her release Shehadeh was neither detained nor deported and went on to make an asylum claim which was rejected in 2007.
In January 2008 she was flown to Jordan but on arrival told immigration officials that she was Palestinian and as a result was refused entry to the country.
In July 2008 the Jordanian embassy told Home Office officials that Shehadeh was not one of their citizens and had only been issued with a temporary travel document by the country's authorities.
A Home Office official later assessed the prospect of sending her to Palestine within a reasonable time as ""highly unlikely"" as her removal would be on a voluntary basis and she refused to return.
It was then proposed that Shehadeh be detained while her case was considered for release with rigorous reporting restrictions.
Since her release in 2009, Shehadeh has maintained that her continued detention was unreasonable and unlawful.
Her counsel Alan Caskie maintained that the risk of her absconding was exaggerated and her immigration record was portrayed as worse than it was.
It was argued for Home Secretary Theresa May that the decision to detain and continue to hold her were lawful.
The government's legal team argued that it was always intended to deport her and the period was reasonable taking into account her previous conduct and refusal to co-operate with her voluntary return.
It was maintained that a letter from the Jordanian authorities in 2012, confirming she was a national of that country, vindicated the decision.
Lord Tyre said, however, that the earlier setback in removing Shehadeh from Britain in 2008 ""necessitated a fresh assessment of the lawfulness of her continued detention"".
The judge said that he reached the view that following the Jordanian embassy advice in 2008 ""a fair-minded assessment balancing the prospect of her successful removal against the risk of absconding ought to have led to the conclusion that the respondent would not be able to effect deportation within a period that was reasonable in all the circumstances.""
The judge said that he considered that her detention ceased to be lawful by the end of August 2008.
Lord Tyre said a finding of unlawful detention did not automatically result in damages but held Shehadeh was entitled to a compensatory award.
The court heard that earlier this year directions were issued to send Shehadeh back to Jordan.
She has now made a fresh claim for asylum in the UK, based on her conversion from Islam to Christianity."
http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-43577232,asylum seeker,348,29 March 2018,None,Germany migrants: Plans to keep asylum seekers in 'anchor centres',"Germany's new interior minister is pressing ahead with controversial plans to hold asylum seekers in centres until their right to stay is determined.
Under Horst Seehofer's proposals, migrants are to be kept in so-called ""anchor centres"" for up to 18 months while their requests are processed.
Critics say keeping people in centres can lead to violence and make it harder for them to integrate in society.
The first centre is likely to be set up in Bavaria this year, officials say.
Mr Seehofer has long been a vocal critic of Chancellor Angela Merkel's refugee policies and has vowed to speed up asylum procedures and increase deportations.
Building the first centre in Bavaria before October's state election had ""the highest priority"", Deputy Interior Minister Stephan Mayer said.
""I'm confident that we can present more detailed plans after the Easter weekend,"" he told German daily Süddeutsche Zeitung (in German).
Migrants with a good chance of staying in Germany would be allowed to leave the centres, he added, without giving details.
Critics also say processing the requests often takes more than the 18-month period proposed by Mr Seehofer, meaning that migrants could be kept in the centres for much longer.
More than one million migrants arrived in Germany as part of Mrs Merkel's open-door policy in 2015.
The backlash sparked by her policy helped fuel the country's far right in last year's election - the Alternative for Germany (AfD) party entered the federal parliament for the first time - and led to the worst electoral performance in almost 70 years for her CDU party.
Mrs Merkel's CDU-CSU conservative bloc and the Social Democrats (SPD) agreed to limit migration as part of a coalition deal.
A note on terminology: The BBC uses the term migrant to refer to all people on the move who have yet to complete the legal process of claiming asylum. This group includes people fleeing war-torn countries such as Syria, who are likely to be granted refugee status, as well as people who are seeking jobs and better lives, who governments are likely to rule are economic migrants."
http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/blogs-trending-33114685,asylum seeker,956,13 June 2015,By Mukul Devichand,None,"The term ""failed asylum seeker"" doesn't usually elicit huge sympathy in the UK - so why did thousands rally behind one man deported this week?
About 25,000 people seek refugee status in the UK each year and a majority are denied permission to remain in the country.
Despite recent concerns about their treatment at detention centres like Yarl's Wood, their individual names and stories do not usually register with the general public.
Majid Ali, a young man whose name and story went viral this week, was an exception.
On social media, nearly 16,000 messages of support for Ali were posted from across the UK - and especially from Scotland.
People tweeted with a campaigning hashtag, ""Don't Deport Majid"".
Many expressed fear that Ali, who arrived in the UK in 2010 and was studying English at City of Glasgow College, could face persecution and even death if deported back to his native Pakistan. ""I'm deeply ashamed to be British,"" one woman tweeted.
The social media buzz didn't work: Ali appears to have been flown back to Pakistan on Tuesday night.
His asylum claim revolved around the troubled politics of his home area of Balochistan, which has seen long-running violent conflict between separatists and the state.
He argued his brother had been subject to an ""enforced disappearance"" by security forces and that other family members were killed. Despite these claims, UK legal authorities rejected his application.
It was only after the decision had been handed down - after the law had run its course - that his case began to trend online.
So why the public sympathy for this one case - and what could a hashtag, created after the system had rejected his claims, hope to actually achieve?
The particular character of Ali as an individual, and his popularity on campus, seems to be one reason his story generated sympathy.
It was his lecturer at City of Glasgow College, Rosie Quin, who first alerted student campaigners to his story. ""He worked hard, he contributed in class, he socialised with his friends in college,"" she told BBC Trending. ""He was just the kind of student ever teacher wants in their class.
""On Tuesday evening when I saw on social media that he had been deported - obviously you just feel dejected and sad,"" she said.
Another important player in the social media trend was the National Union of Students in Scotland, whose president Gordon Maloney explained why they started a hashtag - and why he thinks it took off.
Recent events, from fears about conditions in detention centres, to the plight of those seeking to travel to Europe across the Mediterranean, have led many to ""question the narrative"" around refugees and asylum, he says.
""It was such a clear cut example of someone who should have been allowed to remain. . . that it sparked those underlying feelings,"" he told BBC Trending.
""People were saying they were shocked and appalled by the UK government's approach,"" he added. Many of those tweeting were Scottish MPs and MSPs responding to their constituents feelings on the case - with an early day motion registered in the House of Commons.
In Majid Ali's story, then, various ingredients came together to make him a popular cause: his likeability, a story that resonated, and local political interest.
That makes him an exception. Most asylum seekers never trend online - but there may also be good reasons for them to stay away from social media campaigns.
""It may raise awareness of your case that might help, but it's also got risks involved,"" says Michael Collins at Right to Remain, a charity that advises people seeking refugee status in east London.
""It can be dangerous if you're seeking protection in your home country,"" he says, because it will make people aware of your return.
""People need to be clear: a hashtag trending in the UK is also trending back home.""
For all of his caution though, Mr Collins says there have been instances where social media campaigns for failed asylum seekers appear to have helped them in their legal cases. ""It might bring in legal or expert help,"" he says.
An example is Roseline Akhalu, who feared death if she were deported to Nigeria, because her medical treatment would end. She was supported by a hashtag (""Save Rose"") in 2012 and 2013, and was also backed supported by celebrities such as Colin Firth.
In Akhalu's case, the Home Office delayed a decision over her removal, meaning there was time for advice to be offered to her by lawyers who had noticed the case. She then won an appeal against removal.
Majid Ali, reportedly now back in Pakistan, has not had similar success. But beyond the individual, do hashtags have any effect on the debate over asylum and wider immigration procedures?
""No example of an individual being deported is just about that individual, it's also about a system - and that has to change,"" argues Mr Maloney, the NUS Scotland president.
With the asylum system under strain, changes to procedures have been floated recently - and there is an ongoing review of conditions in immigration detention centres - but it's not yet clear what difference, if any, these would make to a case like that of Majid Ali.

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-australia-45278859,asylum seeker,382,24 August 2018,None,Australians react with horror and humour amidst political chaos,"After days of uncertainty, Australia finally has a new prime minister - their fifth in eight years - following a dramatic leadership battle.
Malcolm Turnbull resigned as leader on Friday after being pushed out in a coup by members of his Liberal party.
His replacement, Scott Morrison, was voted in minutes later by an internal party poll.
Naturally, the country responded by taking to social media - some in horror, others in humour - about the week that was definitely not short on political drama.
In the run-up to the party coup, Twitter was filled with the hashtag #libspill, a reference to the Liberal party's leadership spill - with one left-leaning tweeter calling it the country's ""national sport"".
Even Chinese state media appeared to be tired of the ever-changing state of politics - one user shared this headline from China Daily reading ""Australia changes its prime minister again, again, again, again, again.""
Others compared the state of affairs to reel-life.
One Twitter user in the US also inadvertently became a celebrity in the country after he was mistaken for one of the leadership contenders.
We're looking at you, Peter Dutton from Texas. (He's OK. He used his newfound fame to push his popcorn business.)
Others however, were filled with genuine anger at the situation.
Under the Australian system, as in the UK, the prime minister is not directly elected by voters but is the leader of the party or coalition that can command a majority in parliament.
Not a single leader in recent times has managed to complete a full term, a pattern many Australians say they are sick and tired of.
This was Friday's front page of the notoriously outspoken NT News in the Northern Territory.
Others like Christine Forster, a Liberal party councillor in Sydney, and sister of ex-PM Tony Abbott, tweeted the news had filled them with ""despair"".
Some touched on more serious matters, calling attention to other issues that remain prevalent in Australia which went unaddressed while this drama played out.
Newly minted Greens Senator Mehreen Faruqi tweeted that the situation was ""shameful"".
While the founder of the Asylum Seeker Resource Centre, a non-profit organisation, pointed out that among other pressing issues, children stuck in Nauru as a result of Australia's controversial asylum policies were continuing to suffer."
https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-australia-45292331,asylum seeker,502,24 August 2018,None,Scott Morrison: Australia's conservative pragmatist,"Scott Morrison has emerged as Australia's new prime minister after a chaotic week of political infighting and surprise twists.
A social conservative, Mr Morrison also appeals to the moderate elements of the Liberal Party and is widely recognised as a shrewd and pragmatic political engineer.
Although he did not initiate the leadership challenge against former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull, he defeated the man who did, Peter Dutton, at the final pass.
He then went on to be thanked for his loyalty in Mr Turnbull's final speech as the country's leader.
Yet Mr Morrison - known as "" ScoMo"" around Parliament House - has long been seen to harbour leadership ambitions and was an obvious contender once Mr Turnbull's fragile alliances began to collapse.
The 50-year-old is one of the country's leading religious conservatives and represents a deeply traditional heartland of Sydney.
He opposed the same sex marriage bill but kept a low profile during that debate - he ultimately abstained, a clear sign of his pragmatic approach when politics and personal beliefs collide.
But he rose to national prominence for vigorously enforcing Australia's controversial approach to asylum seekers, including the ""Stop the Boats"" policy, as immigration minister in Tony Abbott's government.
There was trenchant public criticism of the policy, but Mr Morrison proceeded with his severe approach to the portfolio and built a reputation as a tough operator. He remained unfazed by specific accusations about the lack of transparency over what was happening in Australia's offshore detention centres.
It's a reputation that wasn't helped by a precarious moment in 2011, when he was lambasted for a scathing attack on the Labor Government when it flew asylum-seeker relatives to their drowned children's funerals after a boat tragedy off Christmas Island. He apologised - only for the timing.
So when he changed portfolio to social security apprehension swept across Australia's community sector. But he softened his image and when the time came he helped Malcolm Turnbull secure the leadership in 2015.
He was rewarded with the treasury and is widely judged to have delivered a competent performance. Colleagues and opponents laud his work ethic and what they say is his clear communication and consultation with stakeholders.
The son of a police officer, he grew up in Sydney's beachside suburbs. He's seen as the proverbial ""family man"" who understands Australia's suburban conservative values and he is now closely connected to the Pentecostal movement. He married his wife Jenny when he was 21 and the pair have two children.
He has always been politically engaged and was a former state director for the Liberal Party. But he also held senior roles in tourism - he was a former managing director of Tourism Australia - before running for federal office in 2007 and finally entering the cut-throat political stage in Canberra.
He has emerged triumphant in the latest phase of Australia's notoriously bruising political wars, but as the sixth prime minister in 11 years nobody is yet placing bets on whether he can serve out his term."
https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-45075535,asylum seeker,750,6 August 2018,None,Serco 'welcomes' legal challenges to asylum evictions plan,"The boss of public service provider Serco has welcomed legal moves bidding to stop asylum seeker evictions from properties run by his firm.
Rupert Soames said the court challenges could ""bring clarity to an area of law that some people feel is unclear"".
Housing charity Shelter Scotland has filed papers at Glasgow Sheriff Court to prevent two tenants being issued with so-called lock-change orders.
Serco says it is providing housing for 330 people ""at its own expense"".
As well as the sheriff court action, the issue is also due to be raised in the Court of Session in Edinburgh after a case was lodged by Govan Law Centre, which is also trying to prevent the evictions by Serco.
Serco is contracted to provide housing while applications are considered by the Home Office.
Earlier this month it said it planned to evict those tenants who had exhausted the asylum process.
The company said it was no longer willing to provide free accommodation to ""over-stayers"" and would serve lock-change notices to no more than 10 people a week.
Its position prompted widespread criticism from politicians and campaigners who have accused it of putting profit before people.
Following a weekend of protests outside the Home Office building in Brand Street in Glasgow, Serco said it would halt the action ""whilst the law is being tested and clarified"".
Shelter Scotland's legal team presented papers at Glasgow Sheriff Court on Monday on behalf of two of the six asylum seekers who have been issued with eviction notices, while a third was represented by the Legal Services Agency.
Shelter's principal solicitor Fiona McPhail said the halt in the action was a ""massive temporary victory"", and said she would put forward ""various arguments"" against the evictions.
She said: ""There's different arguments, one of the ones we're keen to put forward is the human rights perspective.
""These individuals are at risk of losing their home, we're arguing that Serco are acting on instructions from the Home Office and acting as a public authority and therefore have obligations under the Human Rights Act.
""That there's a requirement for there to be due process, there needs to be safeguards in place and it's not compliant for there to merely be a lock-change at a certain stage.""
Speaking on the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme, Mr Soames said the legal challenges would be an opportunity for clarity on the law surrounding possible evictions.
He explained: ""We recognise that there needs to be confidence among all parties that what we are doing is completely proper and legal.
""This problem of people not moving on when they have had negative decisions has been largely hidden from public view because in Scotland we've been paying for them to keep to their accommodation and stop them being homeless.
""We are now looking after 330 people at our own expense and it can't go on.
""We are not the judge of this. The Home Office is the judge of this and there has to be an end of the road.""
The Serco chief executive insisted the contractor would ""not change the locks"" on anyone unless the Home Office said they had reached the end of their appeal process.
""We are receiving about 180 new asylum seekers each week into Glasgow,"" he added.
""If the people at the end of the process don't move on, there is no housing in Glasgow for the vulnerable families and children who are at the beginning of the asylum seeker process, when they arrive.
""They are going to have to be put in hotels.""
Mr Soames said providing housing for asylum seekers in Glasgow had cost Serco £80m more than it was being paid by the Home Office for the contract.
A Home Office statement said asylum seekers ""who would otherwise be destitute"" are provided with free accommodation while their applications are considered.
It added: ""While an asylum claim or an appeal is outstanding, we would not be seeking removal.
""If the courts have decided that someone has no right to remain in the United Kingdom it is right that they should leave the UK.
""However, if an asylum claim has failed, we will still provide accommodation for those who would otherwise be destitute and who are temporarily unable to leave the UK because of a practical or legal obstacle.""
First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the Scottish government ""stand ready to offer any support that we reasonably can"", calling for ""more humanity at the heart of the immigration and asylum system""."
http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-south-east-wales-42891162,asylum seeker,555,5 February 2018,By Colette Hume,Cardiff baptisms for religious asylum seekers fleeing Iran,"An asylum seeker who fled Iran over fears he would be killed for converting to Christianity is one of 300 to be baptised at a Cardiff church in the past two years.
Conversion from Islam to Christianity is punishable by death in Iran and converters said their decisions mean they can never go home.
Its constitution recognises the faith of Jews, Christians and Zoroastrians.
But people from a Muslim background are not free to worship in a church.
Daniel, not his real name, fled to the UK after authorities in Iran discovered he was worshipping Jesus in an underground Christian movement known as ""house churches"".
Now living in Cardiff, he officially converted from Islam when he was baptised two years ago.
Daniel, 31, said he was in no doubt he would be killed if he returned to Iran.
""If I went back, the authorities would arrest me. They would put me in jail and I would be killed, I would be hanged,"" he said.
""They will kill me, me and my family. I am not afraid because I will be meeting Jesus but I am afraid about my family.""
Daniel claims an Iranian Christian convert friend was murdered and his remains were scattered outside the doors of four churches in his home city as a warning to others thinking of renouncing Islam.
In the past two years, 324 asylum-seekers have been baptised by Tredegarville Baptist Church in Cardiff, where 95% of the congregation are immigrants.
The majority baptised there are Iranian but some are Kurds and Afghans.
Pastor Phylip Rees, who has baptised many asylum seekers in Cardiff and helps with their bids to remain in the UK, said he was in no doubt the vast majority who attend the church were genuine in their faith.
He said he seen evidence Iranian converts at the church had suffered torture in their homeland, including one man who claims he was branded by the authorities.
Pastor Rees also rejected suggestions some parishioners could be using baptism as a way to secure permanent residence.
He said he had refused to support applications previously when he had doubts.
Home Office guidelines for examining asylum claims state the credibility of a faith conversion ""needs to be established to a reasonable degree of likelihood"".
It said that was likely to include being baptised, preparing for baptism, attending worship and being known to the church's leadership and fellow believers.
The Home Office said: ""Those who demonstrate a well-founded fear of persecution in their country on account of their religion or belief are not expected to return there.""
There are no official figures for genuine religious asylum seekers and some in the congregation said they had been waiting more than six years for a decision to be made about their claim.
But Iranian Christian groups are growing in number and can now be found in churches in cities including Glasgow, Liverpool and Birmingham.
Without them, Pastor Rees said the future of some churches would have been uncertain.
""Tredegarville would have closed but for this opportunity to join the Lord in his work of reaching these people,"" Pastor Rees said.
""I'm sure that the other churches would say that the people who are coming to them from other lands as refugees and asylum seekers are a blessing to them as they are to us."""
http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-44601828,asylum seeker,560,30 June 2018,By Chris Wood,Language class problems deny women refugees 'new life',"After escaping police in Eritrea, she crossed a desert, war zone and sea before entering the UK in the back of a lorry.
Despite arriving in Newport in 2014, Tsege Yohannes, 31, is only now able to tell her story in English.
Along with other women refugee and asylum seekers, she is seen as at risk of becoming isolated because of limited opportunities to learn the language.
The Welsh Refugee Council called for women to have the same chances as men.
There are 70 women on a Red Cross scheme in Newport and plans for one in Wrexham - with calls for more tailored classes with crèche and childcare facilities.
""I taught at a Cardiff school and there were children who spoke English like natives, but their mothers couldn't,"" said Theresa Mgadzah Jones, who runs the Newport classes.
""I asked 'why?' You then wonder about tabloid stories - that they do not want to integrate - or they are lazy.""
She found ""a pattern"" - almost all college places were given to men.
Often women were offered places but did not take them because there were no childcare facilities.
Mrs Mgadzah Jones came to the UK in 1972 as a refugee from what is now Zimbabwe because her parents wanted to give her opportunities not offered there.
""I want women to have equality and the opportunity to develop a new life for themselves and integrate into the community,"" she said.
""The husband has a job, children go to school but some women on the course have been here seven years but had no chance to learn English.""
Another asylum seeker Xialing Zhao, from China, has been in the UK six years and was left depressed and housebound from not having a chance to learn English.
There is a creche at the base in Pill, Newport, with numbers increasing each year.
Classes start at beginner level for women from countries such as Sudan and Afghanistan who are unable to read or write in their own language.
They are taught basics to be able to phone the doctor, their child's school or go shopping.
After three years, Mrs Mgadzah Jones encourages women to enrol on a college course.
The Red Cross said it is ""impossible"" to estimate how many women are affected, with people given refugee status able to move anywhere in the UK.
However, from January, there were 2,910 asylum seekers gaining support to live in Wales.
A Welsh Local Government Association (WLGA) survey found there are colleges offering English classes in all council areas.
However, it added: ""The reality is that finding classes at the right level and within reach, with places available at the right time for enough hours, is not always possible.""
It pointed to Cardiff and Swansea - where 500 people were waiting for places - as areas where not everyone got on courses.
Its report said UK government childcare funding is available for when a college does not have a crèche, adding many find it ""impossible"" to attend without it.
A Nation of Sanctuary - Refugee and Asylum Seeker Plan has been drawn up by the Welsh Government.
Tackling ""inequalities and poverty"" are among the aims as it is taken forward.
The Welsh Refugee Council spokeswoman said she wants barriers such as childcare issues and ""cultural inhibitors"" addressed to give women the same opportunities as men."

Two of the women were teenagers and reports say they had been tied up.
The victims are of Asian origin, the Greek daily Kathimerini says, and are believed to be closely related.
A local mayor said his community was shocked by the brutality. The victims' throats had been cut, he added.
One theory is that the women had got into an argument with a people-smuggler. The Greek website News 24/7 says robbery was apparently not the motive, as one victim was found wearing gold jewellery.
The estimated ages of the victims are: 15 to 20, 18 to 25 and 20 to 30. Two knives were found at the scene.
According to police data, more than 8,400 migrants and asylum seekers were intercepted in the Evros area in the first half of this year.
Since 2015 the flow of irregular migrants into Greece has fallen dramatically, after the EU and Turkey signed an agreement to send back to Turkey migrants who do not apply for asylum, or whose claim was rejected."

Writer Eric Ngalle Charles, who runs the classes, said they can be used to help people to express the challenge of seeking asylum and past experiences.
He said: ""Every time they have to go to the Home Office they have to repeat their stories constantly. So these guys are constantly re-traumatised.""
The sessions are held at the Dylan Thomas Centre.
Mr Charles said: ""When I first came to Wales all those years ago, all I had with me was my memory. I didn't know how to articulate, and tell people about my memories.
""I didn't know whether to tell them about the cesspit of crime that was Pechatniki in Moscow, or why as a young man at 17-years-old I was made to leave my homeland with such haste.
""There are organisations that try their best to help people. But they will label you continuously 'refugee', 'asylum seekers'... in a box.
""But when people come here [to the workshops] I remove that garment of an outcast that is a permanent fixture. I take them back to the earliest childhood memories, the first sounds that they heard.
""I will remove them completely from 'I have to go to the Home Office tomorrow', 'I have to go see a solicitor tomorrow'. I remove them completely from this kind of trap, or mental prison they find themselves in.""
Saba Humayun, 23, who has attended the workshops, said: ""I have been living in Swansea for almost two years.
""As a friend, or as a family now, we just try to encourage people to come to this project to share their story if they want.
""I like to tell people what we've been through. We have lots of problems in our life, but still we are here now. We have a chance to speak in front of people.
""Before that I was nervous. But Eric always told me, 'It is only you that can tell your own story to other people'.""
The course, which is organised by Swansea council and funded by the Heritage Lottery Fund and the Welsh Government's Fusion programme, aims to encourage people to take part in the arts."

Ahmed Hassan, 18, admitted building the device that partially detonated on the District Line on 15 September 2017.
Mr Hassan told the court the ""idea of being chased by police and in Europe by Interpol... was very attractive"".
He denies attempted murder and causing an explosion likely to endanger life.
He said the fantasy was about being a fugitive and getting away, rather than the bomb, saying he ""wanted attention"".
Mr Hassan added: ""The idea of killing another human being never crossed my mind at all. Never in my life.""
When the prosecution asked if he regretted his actions, he said: ""I regret [it] very much every day... and I wish I hadn't done it. I wish I could travel back in time.
""I am very sorry but it can't be undone.""
However, prosecutor Alison Morgan said it was ""a very calculated act of anger"".
The teenager told the Old Bailey he did not like having time off from school and had not been sleeping because of bad dreams.
""The school holidays were basically my enemy,"" said Mr Hassan. ""I didn't like it because there was nothing to do. I would get very bored.""
The restless teenager would then watch lots of action movies and documentaries about fugitives, as well as drinking up to six energy drinks each day.
The court also heard he had considered suicide ""many many times"".
The court heard how Mr Hassan made TATP explosives two days before the attack from chemicals he had bought, after he had already assembled a timer by following a ""step-by-step"" guide online.
He then went on to test the explosive the next day in a fizzy drink can on the kitchen table of his foster home in Sunbury, Surrey.
Mr Hassan told jurors: ""I heard a 'whoof' and a very small heat, fire, for a fraction of a second.""
He said he was certain that the substance ""would not explode"" and ""it would just burn"".
But Ms Morgan said he ""knew precisely"" what TATP was and what would happen.
She claimed Mr Hassan had lied about testing the chemical compound on the table as there were no burn marks or traces of explosives found on it.
When he refused to watch the CCTV of the explosion in court, she said: ""Well I will tell you then - there's a huge fireball that rips its way through that carriage, and you say that's what you intended to happen?""
Mr Hassan replied: ""I knew it would make a fire as it did in the test.""
Ms Morgan asked what an ""acceptable level of injury"" would have been, but he said he had not thought about it.
Apologising for his actions, he added: ""I know how hard it is to have trauma... and also for people who cared for me in this country. Now I think this is wrong.""
Earlier, Mr Hassan, an Iraqi asylum seeker, denied having any contact with the Islamic State group in Iraq.
Prosecutors said that he had told Home Office officials 20 months before the attack that he had been kidnapped by IS and trained to kill.
But the teenager told jurors he had lied to improve his case for asylum after being given advice by other migrants he met when he was in the so-called Jungle camp in Calais.
""I came from a wealthy part of Northern Iraq and if I told them that they would have deported me,"" he said.
""In the Jungle in Calais, people used to talk about these things and make up stories.
""I never came across a refugee who said he would tell the truth when he arrived in the country.""
Mr Hassan described his journey to the UK, first from Iraq to Turkey, then on to Italy where he claimed he had been ""abused"" by the Italian authorities.
He travelled from there to Paris and then to Calais, where he stayed for around two months before entering the UK on a lorry in October 2015.
He was then taken to Bay Tree, a Barnardo's home in Horley, Surrey, where he was for about six months, saying it was a ""relief"" after the refugee camp.
Mr Hassan was enrolled on a two-year media course at Brooklands College in Weybridge, Surrey, and his ""ultimate goal"" was to become a wildlife photographer, ""like David Attenborough"".
The teenager claimed to have won a student of the year prize six times in a row in Iraq, and was awarded another at his college in June 2017.
He described himself as a Sunni Muslim and said he prayed five times a day, but when asked if he cared about people being from other faiths, he said: ""Not at all, not in the slightest.""
Mr Hassan also told the jury that both his parents were dead.
He said he was too young to remember his mother, but remembered his father, who died ""in an explosion while he was working as a taxi driver.""
He added: ""He used to go to work and come back evenings and then he did not come back.
""It was very difficult. I did not understand what was going on. I was in a state of confusion because of fighting, because of bombing.""
On Monday, the court heard from the prosecution that Mr Hassan blamed the UK and US for the deaths of his parents, and that he believed his father had been killed by an American bomb.
College lecturer Kayte Cable said Ahmed Hassan told her it was ""his duty to hate Britain"" because of what happened to his family.
The trial continues."
http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-21384435,asylum seeker,810,8 February 2013,By Danny Shaw,Asylum seeker alleges assault during Heathrow deportation,"An asylum seeker alleges he was assaulted by private security staff on a plane at Heathrow Airport, the BBC has learned.
Marius Betondi, who is from Cameroon, claimed he suffered serious injuries to his eye and face during an attempt to remove him from Britain last month.
Scotland Yard and the UK Border Agency have both launched investigations.
Immigration sources denied the assault allegations, saying the injuries were ""self-inflicted"".
Concerns have been raised in the past about the force used during the removal of immigrants. In 2010, a man being deported died.
Mr Betondi, who is 27, arrived in Britain in March 2012.
He applied for asylum on the grounds that he faced persecution in Cameroon because of his sexuality - he says he has been gay since the age of 16.
But the UKBA did not believe him and rejected his request.
Since then, according to the Cameroonian, there have been four failed attempts to remove him, the latest of which took place on 18 January.
Mr Betondi said he was handcuffed and lifted on to a plane by five security guards.
He claimed to be in ""severe pain"" and started crying.
""When I started screaming out they started punching me, punching my face,"" he said.
Mr Betondi claimed his nose and face started bleeding and at one point he thought he was going to suffocate as staff allegedly forced him under a seat on the aircraft.
""I did not resist them at any point because they were powerful and I was handcuffed. I was powerless and couldn't do anything,"" he told the BBC.
But immigration sources said Mr Betondi had caused the injuries himself.
They said he had been placed in handcuffs because of his previous behaviour and became ""highly disruptive"" while boarding the flight and when on board.
The sources said he had ""headbutted"" the seat in front of him and spat blood at escorts and passengers. The removal was aborted.
Photographs of Mr Betondi's injuries appear to show bruising to his face, nose and around an eye, which also seems to be bloodshot.
Mr Betondi claimed he was told by doctors at Northwick Park Hospital in north-west London he had fractured his nose and some of the bones around his eye and urgently needed reconstructive surgery.
Friends said he was suffering from short-term memory loss and blurred vision.
A doctor instructed by Medical Justice, which campaigns for better healthcare provision for immigration detainees, examined Mr Betondi.
Dr Charmian Goldwyn said the ""number, pattern and distribution of injuries is in my opinion typical of their attribution to deliberate blows to the face caused during a recent assault"".
Gareth Mitchell, a solicitor who specialises in cases involving immigration detainees, said legal action was a possibility. He said he would be pressing for a ""full and independent investigation"".
""Whilst our investigations are ongoing and we are still appealing for passengers on this flight who saw this incident to come forward, Mr Betondi appears to have sustained very serious injuries during this removal attempt,"" Mr Mitchell said.
""The extent of these injuries raises once again serious questions about the level of force being used by the Home Office's overseas escort contractors.""
A UKBA spokesman said : ""Where we and the courts find that an individual has no right to be in the UK we expect them to leave. Where they refuse we will enforce their removal.""
The agency said detainee complaints were taken ""very seriously"" and would be thoroughly investigated.
Escort staff on flights out of the UK work for a company called Tascor, which describes itself as the ""largest private sector provider of secure immigration detainee escorting"".
Tascor used to be known as Reliance Secure Task Management, which took over responsibility for removals from G4S in 2011.
Tascor declined to discuss the case but said: ""Although we can't comment on individuals, Tascor focuses on delivering a professional service to its clients while ensuring its methods of operations are compliant with the relevant statutory regulations, as well as agreed client guidelines and industry best practice.
""Any complaints received about employees are investigated thoroughly and are subject to an independent oversight and, in serious cases, investigation conducted by the UK Border Agency. If employees have not met our standards, we will undertake appropriate disciplinary procedures.""
Scotland Yard said inquiries were continuing and there had been no arrests so far.
In March 2010, an independent review, commissioned by the Home Office, criticised the way immigration, escort and security staff used handcuffs to restrain asylum seekers and said private sector security firms had ""inadequately"" managed the use of force.
Seven months later, Jimmy Mubenga died after collapsing while being restrained by guards on a flight preparing to leave Heathrow for Angola.
Last year the Home Affairs Committee also raised concerns about the immigration removal process, saying private security guards had used inappropriate force."

Col Gaddafi - after being shunned by Arab rulers - switched his focus to Africa in the 1990s to raise his international profile.
This was not surprising: Libya's petro-dollars could not buy him influence in the Arab world, but they gave him status and clout in poorer Africa.
""Libya is an African country. May Allah help the Arabs and keep them away from us. We don't want anything to do with them,"" Col Gaddafi said in 2007.
Plight of sub-Saharan Africans in LibyaQ&A: International Criminal Court
A year later, several African traditional leaders declared him ""King of Kings"", while Africa's politicians - including Nelson Mandela - addressed him as Brother Leader.
Col Gaddafi's government invested heavily in Africa - from building roads to financing the African Union (AU).
He saw the African stage as belonging to him, calling for a ""United States of Africa"" to rival the United States of America and the European Union.
Now, his dream lies in ruins - and his latest African convoy could be carrying him as a refugee to escape justice at the International Criminal Court.
Convoys carrying some of his close aides, including his son Saadi, have crossed the Sahara Desert into Niger, from where they could carry on to other countries in West Africa.
While African leaders have had many differences with Col Gaddafi, they admired him as a revolutionary who championed Africa's cause since he seized power in a bloodless coup in Libya in 1969.
As Uganda's President Yoweri Museveni said in February: ""In Africa, we have benefited from a number of independent-minded leaders: Col [Gamal] Nasser of Egypt, Mwalimu Nyerere of Tanzania [and] Samora Machel of Mozambique.
""Muammar Gaddafi, whatever his faults, is a true nationalist. I prefer nationalists to puppets of foreign interests.
2008: ""We want an African military to defend Africa, we want a single African currency, we want one African passport to travel within Africa,"" after being declared King of Kings by African traditional rulers in Libya.
2010: ""We don't know what will happen, what will be the reaction of the white and Christian Europeans faced with this influx of starving and ignorant Africans,"" after discussing halting the flow of African migrants to Italy.
2007: ""Libya is an African country. May Allah help the Arabs and keep them away from us. We don't want anything to do with them.""
2009: ""I am an international leader, the dean of the Arab rulers, the king of kings of Africa and the imam of Muslims, and my international status does not allow me to descend to a lower level,"" at an Arab League summit.
""Therefore, the independent-minded Gaddafi had some positive contribution to Libya, I believe, as well as Africa and the Third World.
""We should also remember, as part of that independent-mindedness, he expelled British and American military bases from Libya [after he took power],"" Mr Museveni said.
African leaders seem to fear that following the offensive by Nato-backed rebels to take power, Libya will again become a ""puppet"" of the West.
For this reason, the AU has refused to recognise the rebel body, the National Transitional Council (NTC), as the new government in Libya.
Nor does the AU support Col Gaddafi being hauled before the ICC on war crimes charges.
Burkina Faso, which borders Niger, had been said to have offered him asylum but now denies it.
The landlocked country is heavily dependent on French aid - and is unlikely to follow through on its offer without approval from Paris, which led the Nato bombing in Libya, analysts say.
Guinea-Bissau's prime minister has said his government would welcome Col Gaddafi ""with open arms"" if he needs exile.
Libya has invested heavily in Guinea-Bissau, which is not a signatory to the Rome Statute setting up the ICC.
Several members of his family have taken asylum in Algeria.
An academic at the University of South Africa, Shadrack Ghutto, says Col Gaddafi would be better off if he sought asylum in a powerful African country such as South Africa and Nigeria.
""Any country that decides to give him asylum will have to be strong enough to withstand political and economic pressure from the West,"" Mr Ghutto says.
Nigeria gave asylum to ousted Liberian leader Charles Taylor in 2003, but it faced enormous pressure from the US and UK to hand him over to a UN-backed special court to face war crimes charges for his role in Sierra Leone's civil war.
Fearing that Nigeria would succumb, Mr Taylor tried to flee by road to neighbouring Cameroon in 2006.
He was arrested and Nigeria handed him over to the court. He is now on trial at The Hague.
The NTC spokesman in London, Guma el-Gamaty, has warned Niger not to grant Col Gaddafi refugee status.
""Niger is a neighbour of Libya from the south and should be considering the future relationship with Libya,"" Mr Gamaty said. ""This - if confirmed - will very much antagonise any future relationship between Libya and Niger.""
Niger has said it would recognise its international obligations - and is signed up to the Rome Statute.
Col Gaddafi has strong support among Niger's Tuareg ethnic group.
He backed their two-decade long rebellion for more political and economic rights, before brokering a peace deal between them and Niger's government in 2009.
Several thousand rebels - including their leader Rissa ag Boula - then went to Libya, either to work or to join Col Gaddafi's army.
They were among the mercenaries who fought for Col Gaddafi as he tried to repel the Nato-backed campaign to overthrow him.
Mr Boula has now returned to Niger, causing a crisis for the government.
The former rebels could either push the government to grant Col Gaddafi asylum or they could harbour him in their desert strongholds along the Libyan border - that is, if Col Gaddafi does not live up to his promise to fight to death in Libya in the hope of being lionised by future generations of Africans as a revolutionary who fought, as Mr Museveni put it, "" puppets of foreign interests"".
But the Libyan rebels were not only backed by Western powers: Arab countries - especially Qatar - played a key role in the campaign to oust Col Gaddafi.
Against this backdrop, the new Libya could build strong ties with the Arab world, shunning Africa.
This would be disastrous for Africa - not only was Col Gaddafi's Libya a key African financier, it also gave employment to hundreds of thousands of African migrants in the oil and other industries.
Denounced by the Libyan rebels as sympathisers of Col Gaddafi, they have been forced to flee, carrying the psychological scars of the conflict and battling to rebuild their lives in their home countries."

A flight carrying Isa Muazu left the UK on Tuesday and has arrived in Lagos.
Mr Muazu, 45, argued he could be killed by Islamist militants in Nigeria, but the Court of Appeal and an immigration tribunal refused to block his removal.
Immigration minister Mark Harper said Mr Muazu had ""no right"" to be in the UK and had been ""successfully removed"".
Mr Muazu's lawyer said his client was being taken to hospital following his arrival in Nigeria.
Mr Harper said Mr Muazu had overstayed his visa by more than five years before claiming asylum, and he was ""not found to have a genuine need of protection"".
""Halting the removal of Mr Muazu because of his protest would undermine our asylum and immigration system - and provide a dangerous incentive for others to follow suit,"" he said.
He said Mr Muazu had been offered ""appropriate"" medical assistance and the UK would cover the cost of an assessment in Nigeria.
Mr Muazu was held in the medical wing at Harmondsworth detention centre in west London.
A psychiatrist found his ""disturbed beliefs"" formed part of a severe mental illness which led him to refuse food.
A previous attempt to deport him failed when a plane carrying him was refused permission to land in Nigeria."

Lawyers for Isa Muazu have launched a new appeal against deportation but said the Home Office had arranged a private jet to fly him back on 17 December.
The earlier bid to remove Mr Muazu, 45, failed due to incomplete documentation.
Mr Muazu, who had been on hunger strike for more than 100 days, says he fears being killed by Islamic extremists.
His application for asylum and humanitarian protection has been rejected.
Mr Muazu, who was described by his legal team as being ""near death"" when the first attempt to deport him was made on 29 November, has reportedly begun to eat again.
But he is said to still be ""ill"" and is being held in the medical wing at Harmondsworth Immigration Detention Centre in west London.
His lawyers, who launched two last-minute attempts to halt his removal two weeks ago, have begun a fresh legal challenge at the Upper Immigration Tribunal in central London.
They are contesting five decisions made by the Home Secretary, Theresa May, including her refusal of his asylum claim and an order to remove him, the court heard.
The hearing is expected to continue until Friday.
Mr Muazu began his hunger strike in September, arguing his asylum claim ""was not treated fairly"".
He claims that if he returns to Nigeria, his life will be in danger from extremist Islamist group Boko Haram.
But an application to stay in the UK was rejected in July, and the Court of Appeal ruled against his argument he was being ""unlawfully held"" at Harmondsworth.
The Nigerian government said it would grant landing rights to a plane chartered by the Home Office to deport Mr Muazu if it tried again."

In January 2017, the council agreed to become a ""designated dispersal area"" to help rehouse Syrian refugees.
But one year on, a council report said it has not started the scheme as it has not been able to find any accommodation.
Conwy council said it was ""committed to receiving families"".
However, two families of Syrian refugees have been rehoused in the county since the local authority signed up to the separate Syrian Vulnerable Persons Resettlement Scheme (SVPRS) in January 2016.
But the council had hoped to resettle five families during 2016-2017 but was unable to secure suitable accommodation - although two families did pull out.
In January last year, the council then voted to implement an Asylum Seeker Dispersal pilot scheme - separate to the SVPRS - after being asked by the Home Office to help ease pressure on Wales' four existing dispersal areas.
Cardiff, Newport, Swansea and Wrexham were experiencing a ""chronic shortage of accommodation"" for those that needed to be rehoused.
The Home Office wrote to all 18 Welsh local authorities who did not house asylum seekers to ask them to start taking people in - and Conwy was the first to formally agree.
But the report, being considered by a council committee on Thursday, said 12 months on, the pilot has not started taking people in.
The council said the main issues with finding properties were ""affordability, suitability of properties and landlord's choice"" but that it was ""continuing to source accommodation"".
Clearsprings Ready Homes, the accommodation provider for the Asylum Seeker Dispersal pilot scheme, is also ""continuing the search to secure a property for this purpose"", the local authority added.
The report stated the council's housing manager was in contact with the UK and visa immigration team, who will review the position again.
Nearly 400 people were re-homed across Wales under the SVPRS by the end of 2016."
http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-42153862,asylum seeker,557,29 November 2017,By Catrin Nye and Leo Sands,Asylum seekers face appeals 'lottery',"Asylum seekers are facing a ""lottery"" depending on where their appeal is heard, research by the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme has found.
Appeals are twice as likely to be successful at some centres compared with others, data obtained through a Freedom of Information request found.
Shadow attorney general Shami Chakrabarti called for an urgent investigation into the findings.
The Ministry of Justice declined our request for a comment.
One legal supervisor said the situation was so severe that they had heard of cases where lawyers had lied about the address of their client to get their case heard at a different location.
The data concerns 36,000 ordinary asylum appeals from January 2013 to September 2016.
The disparity is illustrated by comparing two busy London centres - at Harmondsworth 24% of appeals were successful while at Taylor House it was 47%.
The figures exclude appeals that concluded as fast-track cases.
Access to good quality legal representation in certain parts of the country and a different ""culture"" at hearing centres were repeatedly cited as reasons, during the research.
Legal supervisor Laura Smith, of Duncan Lewis solicitors, said the statistics were ""not surprising at all"".
""It's the kind of arbitrary decision-making which I see across the systems all the time,"" she said, ""that two cases with merit can have completely different results, based on different judges and different hearing centres.""
Ms Smith said she encouraged her clients to move to the district covered by Taylor House if they were able to do so.
And she even knew of lawyers who lied about their client's address.
Two centres with a very low number of successful appeals, Harmondsworth and Yarl's Wood, were also the tribunals that had heard the highest proportion of cases in which the asylum seeker had no legal representation at all in the same period, a further Freedom of Information request found.
Some 32% of cases heard at Harmondsworth featured unrepresented asylum seekers, 23% at Yarl's Wood.
""There are what has become known as legal-aid deserts,"" said Catriona Jarvis, a retired judge who sat at tribunals across the country for 12 years.
""It's wholly wrong. It shouldn't be a lottery.""
Cuts to government legal aid since 2013 have reduced the financial incentive for immigration lawyers to take on time-consuming asylum appeals.
""These are areas of the country where there are no firms of solicitors who are providing immigration asylum law services,"" Mrs Jarvis said.
""That becomes incredibly problematic for asylum seekers who have been sent to live in those parts of the country.""
Baroness Chakrabarti described the variations as ""very upsetting"" and said they could not be due to coincidence or weak cases.
She said: ""Legal-aid deserts for people in different parts of the country means people are going into asylum appeals unrepresented.
""That's completely unacceptable in a humane democracy.""
A spokesman for the judiciary said all judges considered each case individually based on the relevant facts and the law.
The statement said: ""First-tier tribunal immigration judges are deployed across the various hearing centres and do not sit solely in any single one, so it is difficult draw any inferences from the available statistics.
""Ultimately, independent judicial decisions are reviewable on appeal if either side is dissatisfied with the outcome.""

They said Isa Muazu, 45, is now ""near death"", but the Home Office said he was ""fit to fly"" back to Nigeria.
The Court of Appeal had ruled against his argument he was being ""unlawfully held"" at the Harmondsworth Immigration Detention Centre in west London.
Last-minute challenges by his lawyers to halt his removal were also rejected.
Mr Muazu began his hunger strike in September, arguing his asylum claim ""was not treated fairly"".
He said that he came to the UK ""for a better life"", and would ""rather die"" than face removal.
His lawyers launched two last-minute attempts to halt his removal at midnight on Thursday and 06:00 GMT on Friday, but each challenge was rejected by a judge.
Solicitor Toufique Hossain said Mr Muazu had not been answering his phone since early on Friday and he believed a charter flight had been booked to fly him to Abuja, Nigeria, at 08:00 GMT.
Neither the Home Office nor the charter flight company would comment.
On Thursday night protesters gathered outside Harmondsworth detention centre, near Heathrow Airport.
The Metropolitan Police confirmed one man was arrested for criminal damage and was reported to have glued himself to a gate.
Duncan Lewis Solicitors said in a statement that Mr Muazu feared he would be ""killed by Islamic extremists"" on his return to Nigeria.
Mr Muazu has been held in detention since he claimed asylum in July, saying he faced persecution from the hardline Islamic group Boko Haram.
His case was fast-tracked but refused in August, just seven days after his interview.
Mr Muazu's supporters say he has been on hunger strike for more than 100 days.
His lawyers said that despite being 5ft 11in (1.8m) tall, he weighed just eight stone (53kg) and Mr Muazu had told the Independent newspaper he looked ""like a skeleton"".
Mr Hossain also said that Mr Muazu's removal was originally set by scheduled flight for 27 November.
This was then rearranged for ""express reasons of administrative preference"".
Mr Hossain said: ""The home secretary went to great lengths to remove this seriously-ill man from the UK.
""She didn't allow him an in-country right of appeal against his asylum refusal - at massive expense to taxpayers, she hired a private charter plane to remove Mr Muazu to Nigeria.""
Mr Hossain said he now ""did not know"" where Mr Muazu was. ""We lost contact with him late last night,"" he said.
""We fear for his safety now on return but we will be looking at pursuing further appeals if we do make contact with him in Nigeria. He should not have been removed from the UK."""

Americans will vote for members of both chambers of Congress, as well as for governors in 36 out of 50 states.
Between now and then, we'll bring you updates and all the best analysis every weekday in this round-up.
Today we look at the southern border, a special hotline and a bad day at the office for self-declared presidential hopeful Michael Avenatti.
Reports emerged in US media overnight suggesting President Trump is considering closing the country's southern border using an executive order.
The move would bar migrants, including asylum seekers, from entering the country through Mexico.
It follows days of tweets by the President agitating over a caravan of Central American immigrants progressing north toward the US.
Mr Trump has tied the issue to the upcoming mid-terms, despite the group still being more than 1,000 miles and weeks away on foot.
Strong action on the border is likely to play well with Mr Trump's anti-immigration base - who elected him with famously tough rhetoric about the US-Mexico frontier.
According to the New York Times, Mr Trump could announce the closure early next week, invoking national security concerns, as he did with other travel bans.
Defence Secretary James Mattis is also expected to deploy around 800 troops to the US-Mexico border to help stop the migrant group.
Democrats in Georgia have launched a special hotline to help answer questions from confused voters.
The call-centre, dubbed a voter protection ""war room"" by CNN, was set-up to help in a race that has been dominated by allegations of voter suppression.
Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp is neck-and-neck against former state representative Stacey Abrams - who hopes to become the country's first African-American female governor.
Earlier in the race, a bombshell Associated Press report said that 53,000 registrations (70% of which were from black voters) have been held up by Mr Kemp's office over technicalities.
Ms Abrams has accused her opponent of attempting voter suppression, saying his ""pattern of behaviour"" is eroding public trust in the system.
Mother Jones went behind the scenes at the hotline office - where 180 volunteers work in shifts to answer about 300 calls, 12 hours a day.
Michael Avenatti, the lawyer best known for representing adult film actress Stormy Daniels, had a very bad day at the office on Thursday.
The outspoken Trump critic, who has been open about his ambitions to run for president, is taking heavy flak for an interview he gave in Time magazine.
In the piece Mr Avenatti said he believes the Democrats' 2020 nominee ""better be a white male"".
Pressed further, he cited the ""realities of the situation"" for his statement.
""I think if the Democrats nominate anyone other than a white male at the top of the ticket, they're gonna lose the election,"" he told the magazine.
On the same day, both Avenatti and his client Julie Swetnick (who came out with allegations against Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh before his confirmation) were referred to the Department of Justice.
Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley wrote to the FBI and Attorney General Jeff Sessions to say the pair should be investigated for making ""materially false statements"" to his committee.
On Twitter Mr Avenatti, who stands by his client, welcomed any investigation, declaring: ""It's Christmas in October!""
Write your own future with our signature mid-term elections game, showing all the possible outcomes of the vote. Only 11 days to go."
https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-45269773,asylum seeker,854,5 September 2018,By Maddy Savage,Nationalist vote set to shatter Swedish calm,"Sweden has long enjoyed a reputation for moderation and balance, but is its political landscape about to change dramatically with Sunday's election, the tightest race in decades?
The anti-immigration Sweden Democrats are on course to become Sweden's second-biggest party, after a campaign that has focused on migration and integration.
""They have the most things that are right for me... they're for Swedes,"" says first-time voter Sandra Sundstrom, 18, as she stops at a party stall in Orebro, central Sweden.
Not long ago Sweden had one of the most open, generous approaches to asylum in the world, and an electorate that supported it.
But things changed swiftly with the migrant crisis of 2015, when Sweden took in a record 163,000 asylum seekers, proportionately more than Germany.
The influx put a strain on housing, healthcare and welfare services. The centre-left government brought back border controls and toughened conditions for asylum and family reunification.
In this small, politically divided city in rural central Sweden, canvassers hand out flyers on the cobblestones of the main square, Stortorget.
""Many parties want to take in more people from other lands,"" complains Sandra, who is unemployed. ""But the Swedish people can't have the work they really want.""
Sweden's unemployment rate is 6.8%, level with the EU average, but for foreign-born citizens it is 16.2%.
Now all Sweden's traditional parties have hardened their tone to reflect concerns about integration and an increase in shootings, hand grenade attacks and arson attacks on cars in areas with a high proportion of immigrants.
But it is the Sweden Democrats (SD) who are predicted to almost double their 2014 share, with opinion polls suggesting they will secure the votes of one in five Swedes.
For a nationalist party linked for years to neo-Nazis and other far-right groups it would certainly be a success. It only entered parliament in 2010.
Meanwhile, there has been a fall in support for the ruling centre-left Social Democrats and the largest traditional opposition party, the centre-right Moderates.
The SD's official line now is that it welcomes supporters from all backgrounds, although racist scandals persist.
One municipal candidate shared a song on Facebook with the lyrics ""Swedes are white and the country is ours"", according to a report in tabloid Aftonbladet.
""There are no Nazis in our party,"" says Per Soderlund, the party chairperson in Orebro.
""If you look at our voters and our members, it's basically your average Joe. It's your neighbour.""
The SD core base is working class men. But growing numbers of women and more educated and higher-income voters are also backing their tough line.
""I think many voters feel fed up, they want to give the finger to the big parties,"" says Ola Karlsson, who leads the Moderates in this part of Sweden.
""It's easy to say we should have changed earlier, much earlier,"" he admits.
Analysts agree that the big parties were slow to change their stance on immigration, but Orebro University political scientist Ann-Catrin Kristianssen believes they also failed to move the debate away from the ""dark picture"" painted by the Sweden Democrats.
After all, Sweden's economy is booming and the state continues to provide a strong welfare safety net.
""There are problems in some of the urban areas and no party is really denying that. But Sweden is a rich country and has a lot to offer its citizens. Why haven't they been able to paint this brighter picture?"" she asks.
And it has not been all about immigrants, because climate change has become a top issue for voters.
Sweden has just had its hottest few months on record, hit by Europe's heatwave.
Around 25,000 hectares of forest burned in wildfires and many farmers were forced to destroy livestock after their pasture land dried up.
""It's been a tough summer,"" says Adam Arnesson, 28, who runs a farm just outside Orebro and usually votes for one of Sweden's smaller centre-right parties. ""I'm thinking more about voting for the Greens because they are the only ones putting the climate in the centre.""
Support for the Green party, which had been struggling after various internal scandals, has crept up across Sweden.
The Left party is making gains too, both on the environment and from centre-left voters dissatisfied with the mainstream parties' approach to migration.
Some analysts think the heatwave could weaken support for the Sweden Democrats, who are popular in rural areas but do not prioritise climate policies.
But many voters in Orebro remain undecided.
""I will not vote for (the) Sweden Democrats, that's the only thing I know!"" says Salmon Kidane, 20.
And 70-year-old Ruth is unhappy that the Swedish idea of solidarity is losing traction, in a nation traditionally proud of its openness.
""I'm afraid of those populist trends that are coming in Europe. I have a feeling we're going the same way in Sweden and I don't like that,"" she says.
Few imagine the SD will get into government, as they are still too far from the traditional parties' agendas to even negotiate a coalition.
But Ann-Catrin Kristianssen thinks the nationalists could ""rewrite the political map"" and Sweden's old ""bloc politics"" could well end."

For two decades the payout has been less than that paid to native Germans.
The Constitutional Court ruled the current benefits level of 224 euros (£175; $274) per month, or about 7.50 euros a day, was insufficient.
It said it did not meet the constitutional stipulation that everybody should be entitled to a ""humane subsistence level"".
The court said that Germany's 130,000 asylum seekers should receive 336 euros a month, compared to the minimum welfare payment to German citizens of 374 euros.
It ordered the increase be paid immediately, pending legislation in parliament.
""The Basic Law guarantees subsistence-level support for a life in decent conditions as a human right,"" the court said.
""This basic right applies to German citizens and foreign citizens living in Germany in equal measure."""

Saeed Ullah sued the Home Office over being held twice with a view to being removed from the UK and returned to the war-torn region.
The 44-year-old based his action on being denied access to a policy granting exceptional leave to remain.
He now lives in Belfast as a naturalised British citizen.
Mr Ullah's legal team also argued that he suffered a psychological adjustment disorder as a result of being denied leave to remain.
The settlement, involving an £85,000 pay-out plus legal costs, was confirmed ahead of a planned two-day hearing of the case.
After fleeing Afghanistan in 1999, Mr Ullah came to the UK and claimed asylum.
His application was rejected two years later, leaving him vulnerable to being returned to his country of origin because he had not established a claim for international protection.
However, at the time the Home Office had in place an Exceptional Leave to Remain (ELR) policy for failed Afghan asylum seekers.
Based on the wider conditions in the country, it remained in effect until 2002.
Mr Ullah argued that he was never told about the policy, and that it should have been applied to him due to his nationality.
Instead, he was detained between June and July 2004 with the threat of being sent back to Afghanistan.
He was taken to the remand wing at Maghaberry Prison and then a temporary immigration centre on the Crumlin Road, Belfast.
Two years later he was held again at various detention centres in England and Scotland between September 2006 and March 2007.
Mr Ullah declined to comment following the resolution to his case.
But his solicitor, Jack Quigley of Madden and Finucane, said the action was part of wider legal proceedings issued to stop his removal.
""We strongly welcome today's settlement on behalf of our client who now feels vindicated for bringing his claim against the secretary of state,"" Mr Quigley said.
""The failure to apply the policy to our client and grant him ELR was a material public law error."""

Lydia Besong and husband Bernard, who live in Bury, Greater Manchester, were granted a judicial review in January as they were due to be deported.
The UK Border Agency said it was disappointed that an asylum tribunal had ruled in the couple's favour.
The Cameroon High Commission said the country respected human rights.
""The tribunal has recognised that Lydia and Bernard's political and cultural activities will place them at risk if they are returned to Cameroon,"" said their solicitor Gary McIndoe.
""This is a deeply important victory for everyone interested in ensuring the safety of our refugees,"" he added.
The couple, who came to the UK in 2006, argued they would be tortured and beaten if they were returned to Cameroon.
Their high-profile supporters included actor Juliet Stevenson, author Nick Hornby and playwright Alan Ayckbourn.
The couple, who were released from Yarl's Wood Detention Centre in Bedfordshire in January, had been due to be put on a flight to Cameroon.
They belong to the Southern Cameroon National Council (SCNC), an organisation campaigning for the rights of the country's minority English-speaking population in the largely French-speaking African state.
The group is illegal because it advocates secession for two English-speaking provinces.
Mrs Besong who was an English lecturer in Cameroon, has written plays in the UK including How I Became An Asylum Seeker and Down With The Dictator, which was performed recently in Manchester.
Nkwelle Ekaney, the Cameroon High Commissioner for the UK, rejected the couple's claims.
""After a series of meticulous investigations, the Home Office came to the conclusion that over the years, Cameroonian asylum seekers had been taking advantage of the leniency of the system to use human rights abuse as the most expedient and guaranteed method to acquire asylum status in the United Kingdom,"" he said.
""Cameroon is a country that respects human rights and the rule of law and also adheres to relevant treaties and international conventions that respect the integrity and dignity of the human person,"" he said."
http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-13638489,asylum seeker,22,3 June 2011,Mark Easton,Controversy over asylum seeker 'amnesty',"Here's my piece about the controversy surrounding the tens-of-thousands of asylum seekers who have effectively been granted ""amnesty"" to stay in Britain."

Tests to determine sexual orientation are controversial, but are sometimes used when assessing asylum claims.
The European Court of Justice (ECJ) ruling is binding in all 28 EU states.
The ECJ case relates to a Nigerian man who submitted an asylum application in Hungary in April 2015. He feared persecution in Nigeria for being gay.
Hundreds of homosexuals fearing persecution in Africa, the Middle East and Chechnya have sought asylum in the EU, the EU Agency for Fundamental Rights reports.
The Nigerian's claim was rejected after a psychologist's report failed to confirm his homosexuality.
A court in Szeged, Hungary, must now reconsider his case in light of the ECJ ruling.
In December 2014 the ECJ ruled on a similar case in the Netherlands and found that sexuality tests violated asylum seekers' human rights.
In the new ruling, the ECJ said ""certain forms of expert reports may prove useful"" in such cases, but added that such reports interfered with a person's privacy. Authorities must also determine the reliability of a claimant's statements, the judges said.
In 2013 the ECJ ruled that asylum could be granted in cases where people were actually jailed for homosexuality in their home country.
Homosexual acts are illegal in most African countries, including key Western allies such as Uganda, Nigeria, Kenya and Botswana.
The Hungarian court cannot appeal against the ECJ ruling, so the Nigerian man - identified only as ""F"" - now has a stronger claim for asylum.
The ruling means that EU countries now have no legal right to impose psychological tests to determine an asylum seeker's sexuality.
The ECJ says Hungarian officials had not found F's statements to be fundamentally contradictory, but had still concluded that F lacked credibility.
Their decision was based on a psychologist's report, which included:
The report ""concluded that it was not possible to confirm F's assertion relating to his sexual orientation"".
Psychologists have long held that personality traits can be revealed by tests such as ""draw a person in the rain"" and the Rorschach test, which relies on an individual's interpretation of inkblots.
They were quite general psychological tests, aimed at identifying F's personality type and emotional characteristics.
F said the tests had violated his fundamental rights and they had not provided any assessment of ""the plausibility of his sexual orientation"", the ECJ said.
It also said any indication of sexual orientation provided by such tests could only be ""approximate in nature"". They were ""of only limited interest for the purpose of assessing the statements of an applicant for international protection"".
In 2010 the EU's Fundamental Rights Agency condemned the Czech authorities for using ""phallometric"" sexual arousal tests on some asylum seekers to determine whether they were gay. Czech officials said the tests had been used in fewer than 10 cases, with the individuals' consent.
The Hungarian court handling F's case quoted him as saying that he had not undergone any physical examination and had not been required to view pornographic photographs or videos.
No - other EU countries also conduct psychological tests on asylum seekers, to assess whether their statements can be believed.
The UK Home Office has detailed guidance on asylum claims based on sexual orientation.
The gay rights group ILGA-Europe says there is a huge diversity in the EU in the way asylum authorities assess someone's sexual orientation.
In F's case tests were imposed on him - unlike the Dutch asylum case of 2014, when several Africans offered evidence of their homosexuality.
In the Dutch case, the ECJ ruled that it was wrong to conduct ""detailed questioning as to the sexual practices of an applicant for asylum"".
F's asylum claim in 2015 came during a migrant crisis for Hungary. The country faced a huge influx of migrants - many of them Syrians, Iraqis and Afghans fleeing war. Most of them moved to Germany, via Austria, and Hungary then built a formidable border fence to keep migrants out."

The group had resisted leaving the Manus Island camp after it shut on 31 October, fearing attacks by locals.
Buses carrying about 300 asylum seekers left the centre on Friday after police entered the facility for a second day.
Some detainees claimed they were struck with poles by PNG police.
Australia's Immigration Minister Peter Dutton said that claims of violence were ""inaccurate and exaggerated"". Australian police said they were not involved in the operation.
Under a controversial policy, Australia has detained asylum seekers arriving by boat in centres on Manus Island and Nauru, a small Pacific nation.
The government has said the detainees will never settle in Australia, arguing such a move would encourage human trafficking and prompt deaths at sea.
The Manus Island centre, which held only men, was shut down by Australia after a PNG court ruled it was unconstitutional. A majority of the men still there are refugees, the UN says.
About 600 asylum seekers and refugees initially refused to leave the camp, arguing they were unsafe in the local community - where their presence is a cause of tension.
Human Rights Watch has said the men could face ""unchecked violence"" after being attacked in the past with rocks and knives.
About 300 men left the centre before Friday, after enduring squalid conditions and pressure from authorities. Electricity, food and water was cut at the centre when it closed.
Video on social media showed PNG authorities swinging poles towards asylum seekers on Friday, in what some of the men described as beatings.
""They [the asylum seekers] don't like to move but then they beat us,"" one refugee told the BBC on Friday.
Mr Dutton rejected such claims, saying that reports violence and injuries were ""inaccurate and exaggerated"".
Earlier, PNG police commissioner Gari Baki said that the police operation was being conducted ""peacefully and without the use of force""
They were moved by buses to three transit centres elsewhere on Manus Island. The sites are secure and provide food and medical services, according to Australia.
However, that claim has been repeatedly contradicted by the UN's refugee agency. On Tuesday, a representative said the housing remained ""under construction"", was inadequately secured, and lacked sufficient medical and welfare care.
Mr Dutton said on Friday that some equipment, including generators, had been ""sabotaged"" at the transit centres.
Hywel Griffith, BBC News Sydney correspondent
The stand-off is over, but there's still no real resolution to the situation on Manus Island.
Some of the refugees moved today are still hoping an agreement with the US will eventually see them resettled abroad.
But it's now a year since that deal was struck and progress has been slow, with only a few dozen people accepted so far.
Even if Australia is right about the transit centre facilities, refugees and asylum seekers do not know how long they will stay there - or what their final destination will become.
Refugees had been given the option of permanent resettlement in PNG, applying to live in Cambodia, or requesting a transfer to Nauru. Advocates say few have taken up these options.
The US has agreed to take up to 1,250 refugees from Manus Island and Nauru. However, it may ultimately accept fewer than that.
The agreement, which is being administered under the UNHCR, is prioritising women, children and families and other refugees found to be the most vulnerable.
New Zealand has offered to take 150 refugees from the PNG centre, but Canberra has rebuffed this proposal - arguing it would effectively be a ""back door"" to Australia.
Last month, Australia and PNG each said the other was responsible for the asylum seekers in the meantime.
Yes. Six asylum seekers have died on Manus Island since the facility was re-opened in 2012, including Iranian man Reza Barati who was murdered during a riot.
Earlier this year, the government offered compensation totalling A$70m (£41m; $53m) to asylum seekers and refugees detained on Manus Island who alleged they had suffered harm while there."

The Palestinian attacker, Ahmad Alhaw, killed a 50-year-old man and seriously wounded six other people.
Alhaw shouted Islamist slogans as he lashed out. He was pursued and held down in the street by men from the German-Turkish community.
Alhaw pledged allegiance to the Islamic State group.
But as there was no evidence that IS had helped him plot the attack, he was not charged with terrorism.
The judge highlighted the particular severity of the attack, making it unlikely that Alhaw will qualify for early release after the standard 15 years.
Since 2015, more than a million migrants and refugees, many of whom had fled war and abuses in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria, have entered Germany as a result of Germany's liberal migration policy.
The Hamburg attack was the second significant Islamist attack in less than a year.
In December 2016, a Tunisian failed asylum seeker killed 12 people by driving a truck into a Christmas market in Berlin.
The migration situation has caused significant debate in Germany, with both main political groupings perceived as being hurt by their migration policies in the September 2017 general election.
Some have suggested migrants should be paid to leave the country.
Hamburg's Interior Minister Andy Grote said after the attack that the attacker could not be deported as he lacked identification documents and was psychologically unstable."

Two Afghan teenagers were assaulted by two men on Saturday afternoon in Hasselfelde, reports said.
On Friday night, five drunk Germans attacked three Somalis on their way home in Halberstadt, police confirmed.
The racially motivated attacks come as national tensions are high over the issue of migrants and crime.
More than one million migrants have arrived in Germany as part of Chancellor Angela Merkel's open-door policy in the wake of Europe's migrant crisis in 2015.
In Saturday's incident, four Afghans teenagers were at the edge of a sports field when they were verbally abused by two unidentified men, believed to be between 25 and 30 years old.
The altercation turned violent and left two 17-year-olds slightly injured. A woman who tried to intervene was pushed against a car by the attackers, but was otherwise unharmed, police said.
In Friday's incident, which took place 30km (19 miles) away, all three migrants were physically injured after being verbally assaulted.
A 22-year-old man from the group of five suspected attackers, aged between 22 and 40, also sustained minor injuries, police confirmed.
Police say they are investigating for charges of incitement and assault in both cases, but no arrests have been made yet."
http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-15533921,asylum seeker,745,1 November 2011,By Anna Holligan,Netherlands divided over Angolan teen asylum seeker,"The case of an 18-year-old Angolan asylum seeker has proved tricky for the Dutch parliament, as politicians debate whether Mauro Manuel should be given the right to remain in the Netherlands.
The teenager has become something of a celebrity here, appearing on chat shows and on the front pages of almost all the daily newspapers.
His case has captured the public imagination and is being used to highlight what some believe is a huge flaw in the Dutch asylum system.
At the moment there are around 75 children fighting similar battles to be allowed to stay in the country.
Now that Mauro has turned 18, under Dutch immigration law he must be deported. But his supporters argue it is not that simple.
On Tuesday Dutch MPs rejected two motions that would have given him a Dutch residence permit.
Next week they are expected to vote on a compromise motion which would allow him to stay until he hears if a temporary, four-year student visa has been granted.
Mauro Manuel was stashed on a plane by his mother, who feared her young son would struggle to survive in their war-torn homeland of Angola.
When Mauro arrived in the Netherlands he was picked up by police and eventually fostered by a family in the southern Dutch province of Limburg.
Eight years on Mauro is taking a vocational course at college, he is a decent footballer and his foster parents have recently had a son who Mauro counts as his little brother.
He even speaks fluent Dutch with the unmistakable Limburg drawl.
The president of the Green Party, Henk Nijhof, was so angered by the thought of his country expelling someone who he believes is so integrated in the community he started a campaign to support the family.
""Enough is enough and we have to stop this,"" he said.
""Rules are rules, but you cannot switch off your heart and your brain. You must remember what's good and what's right and this is just not right.""
Last week, Dutch Immigration and Asylum Minister Gerd Leers ruled that Mauro had no right to stay in the Netherlands.
Despite significant political opposition Mr Leers acknowledged that there were many others in Mauro's situation and therefore he could not make an exception.
The case is further complicated by the existence of the increasingly influential anti-immigration Freedom Party (PVV) leader Geert Wilders.
Mr Wilders has led calls for Mauro to be deported and has threatened to stop lending support to the leading Liberal Party if they allow him to stay.
In the Netherlands the coalition government relies on support from the populist PVV to get many of their policies through parliament.
So the withdrawal of that support could have damaging repercussions and some have suggested it could even force elections.
It depends now on the Christian Democratic party - so far two of their members have agreed to back Mauro's right to remain.
If two more do the same it could potentially be enough to force a change in the current law.
However, if another fundamental Christian group supports the government it will mean a small majority in favour of forcing Mauro to be repatriated.
The United Nations children's agency, Unicef, has also intervened, stating that if the teenager were to be uprooted now, at a time when he is fully established and integrated in Dutch society, it would be a contravention of the UN Convention on Children's Rights and ""seriously impair"" his development.
A representative for the Dutch children's ombudsman Marc Dullaert said it was a ""shocking"" case and that if Mauro Manuel were deported he would fight the decision at the European Court in Strasbourg.
On Tuesday Mauro was joined by about 700 supporters and celebrities at the Dutch parliament to submit a petition signed by more than 55,000 people who believe he should be given the right to remain.
A guitarist who performed at the protest said: ""We're here for the same reason as everyone else - we don't want Mauro to go.
""It's a really horrible situation. He's been to school, he speaks Dutch, he is Dutch.""
Mauro himself has made a final plea to the politicians who hold his fate in their hands.
""I promise I will always try to be an asset to the Netherlands,"" he said.
""Please let me stay here forever. My future is in the Netherlands. I would like to be an example to others and work for Dutch society all my life."""
http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-14989700,asylum seeker,409,20 September 2011,None,MP condemned for Gurkha 'asylum seeker' remarks,"Gurkha campaigners have condemned a Conservative MP who said the Nepalese veterans should be dispersed around the UK like asylum seekers.
Gerald Howarth said towns in his Aldershot constituency were suffering ""very considerable burdens"" after an influx of about 10,000 Gurkhas.
But Peter Carroll, of the Gurkha Justice Campaign, described the idea as ""shocking and unacceptable"".
Gurkhas won the right to live in the UK in 2009 after a high profile campaign.
Mr Carroll said he had written to the prime minister and deputy prime minister to ask them to intervene and ""rein in"" Mr Howarth.
The Aldershot MP, a junior defence minister, told BBC Radio 5 live on Saturday that this Hampshire constituency was facing a ""very serious situation"".
""It's imposing very considerable burdens on local services, particularly on the health services,"" said Mr Howarth.
""Essentially it's very unfair on both the local population and on the Nepalese, many of whom are wholly unfamiliar with our culture, don't speak English, don't appreciate the climate and I think have been lured here under false pretences.""
Recommending that Gurkhas were rehoused across the country, he added: ""It's a perfectly sensible policy. Dispersal is what we do with asylum seekers.""
He also criticised Joanna Lumley - who fronted the campaign to secure the Gurkhas' rights - and said the actress had not realised the consequences of her actions.
""She has taken no interest in the problems that we face here, Mr Howarth told BBC Radio 5 live.
""The fact is that Joanna Lumley ran a very high-profile, wholly emotional campaign to overturn a long-standing 50-year-old agreement which had stood the test of time.""
Peter Carroll said the comments had caused ""huge anxiety and hurt"" among the Gurkha community.
""The Gurkhas have suffered discrimination for decades,"" he said.
""I feel that the hundreds of thousands of people that supported the campaign will feel a sense of great disappointment and outrage that this situation has arisen, and will be looking to the prime minister and deputy prime minister to rein in Mr Howarth.""
More than 200,000 Gurkhas fought for the British army in the two world wars, and in the past 50 years they have served in places such as the Falklands, Kosovo, Iraq and Afghanistan.
The successful campaign to secure their residency rights means that all retired Gurkhas with at least four years' service can now live in the UK.
Based at Shorncliffe near Folkestone, their current force numbers about 3,500 men."

The UK Border Agency (UKBA) deferred Robert Segwanyi's deportation minutes before he was due to board a flight to the east African country.
Lib Dem MP Mike Hancock said the 32-year-old was burnt with molten plastic in Uganda, where gay acts are illegal.
The Home Office found Mr Segwanyi not to have a genuine claim.
The UKBA is still considering representations put in by Mr Segwanyi's lawyers and so has deferred the removal.
A spokesperson said: ""Mr Segwanyi's removal has been temporarily suspended to enable us to consider representations received on his behalf. If, upon consideration of these representations, the decision to deport Mr Segwanyi is maintained we will continue to pursue his removal as a matter of priority.""
Ugandan bishop Christopher Senyonjo and Portsmouth South MP Mr Hancock have campaigned to prevent Mr Segwanyi's deportation.
Mr Hancock said: ""I welcome the decision tonight not to deport Mr Segwanyi and all I ask is that Mr Segwanyi's case is properly considered, which I believe it hasn't been up until now.""
Mr Hancock said he had ""grave concerns"" about the way the case had been handled and said he had received letters from UKBA containing ""errors on the law"".
He continued: ""I hope that the UKBA will now consider his case properly.
""However it is bad that Mr Segwanyi was put through the agony of thinking he would be deported right up until the 11th hour.""
A spokesman for Mr Hancock said Mr Segwanyi had come to the UK in May 2010, applying for asylum in July 2010 on the grounds he was gay.
However immigration and appeal judges did not accept his claimed sexuality, the spokesman said.
Anglican bishop Mr Senyonjo, who is currently in the UK, said people who were gay or perceived to be gay ""undoubtedly face questioning at the [Ugandan] airport and will likely face harassment and possibly violence from the police, as we have witnessed before"".
A spokesman for the Ugandan High Commission has yet to comment.
In Uganda many people condemn homosexuality both as un-African and un-Christian.
In May, Uganda's parliament adjourned without debating an anti-homosexuality bill, which includes the death penalty for some gay acts.
However the bill could still be brought up when the new parliament meets later this year.
In January, David Kato, a campaigner who led condemnation of the bill, was murdered in Uganda. Police denied the killing was because of his sexuality."
http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-26189348,asylum seeker,898,14 February 2014,By Chris Page,Nowhere to go: Life as a destitute asylum seeker in Belfast,"Stanley Phiri cannot take the most basic of needs for granted.
The 21-year-old Zimbabwean has no permission to work and is dependent on charities to feed and clothe him.
I met him at Common Grounds coffee shop in south Belfast, where he volunteers.
""I'm trying to keep myself busy. I try to get involved in different organisations. It helps me to reduce the stress in my life,"" he said.
I spent an afternoon with Stanley, to get an idea of what his hand-to-mouth life in Belfast is like.
He gets most of his clothes from two charity shops.
He looks for the items he would like, about four every month, then he goes back to the hostel where he lives.
The charity that runs that hostel, the Simon Community, writes a letter for him so he can pick up the clothes.
He explained how he buys food with the £20 a week he gets from another charity, the Society of St Vincent de Paul.
Asylum seekers are often at the extreme end of the poverty spectrum.
They come from several dozen countries, often the ones that feature in news headlines about conflict.
The Home Office does not collect figures specifically for Northern Ireland but the statistics from charities and some statutory organisations give a general picture.
Most estimates put the number of asylum seekers in Northern Ireland at the moment at between 400 and 500.
Somalis have been the biggest group in recent years, but people have come from several dozen other countries, including Sudan, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and, most recently, Syria.
The Home Office assesses whether an application for asylum is valid, based on the 1951 UN Convention on Refugees.
It obligates countries to take in people who are have a ""well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion""
Those whose asylum applications are successful are initially granted permission to stay for five years.
Then their status is reviewed to see if they will be allowed to stay permanently.
Successful applicants cease to be asylum-seekers and are officially termed ""refugees"".
The latest UK-wide figures, for the 12 months to March 2013, show that around 37% of asylum seekers were granted permission to stay.
But some whose applications are rejected do not go home immediately.
This can be for a number of reasons.
They might appeal against the decision, as Stanley Phiri is doing.
Their home countries may not have them back, or it may not be safe to return.
People in this position are officially classed as ""destitute"" and entitled to what is called Section 4 support.
Voluntary organisations are aware of at least 20 families and 14 individuals in Northern Ireland who are in this situation at the moment.
They get £35 per week to live on, which comes on a special payment card that can only be used in about nine retailers.
Invariably, asylum seekers in this position rely on charity hand-outs.
Neil McKittrick, from the Red Cross, says organisations like his fill a critical gap.
""The fear for us is that if people weren't being seen by charities like the Red Cross, where else would they turn?"" he says.
""For us the fear would be that the ultimate would happen and someone would die of starvation or could end up sleeping rough in Botanic Park in the cold weather.
Bryson Intercultural is the charity that looks after asylum seekers when they initially arrive in Northern Ireland.
Its director Jo Marley said the situation by which people do not have permission to stay and yet cannot go home is a ""conundrum"".
""I think what we struggle to get our heads around is that they live here on the kindness of others with total insecurity about how they're going to manage - yet it's still better than going back"" she said.
She is keen to emphasise that asylum seekers do not come to Northern Ireland to take advantage of state benefits.
Indeed, many of them not aware of even the concept of a welfare state before they come to the UK, she said.
I have not met a group of people who have been so thankful for the opportunity to tell their stories.
One point they all wanted to make was that their support network in Northern Ireland. friends, churches, volunteers, has kept them going.
Recent headlines about hate crimes might give the impression that Northern Ireland is an unwelcoming place.
But, going deeper, we have discovered a society that is warm, generous and kind to strangers.
Norma Nyamambi is from Zimbabwe and a member of the Friendship Club, in which people from many different nations meet in south Belfast on a Thursday evening.
She is destitute and said the club, and the friends that she has made there, have been a lifeline to her.
""When I first came to Northern Ireland, I had nowhere to go,"" she says, ""but Friendship Club became my home.""
""It's really hard to be destitute in this country but if you come as an asylum seeker and introduce yourself to the community, they will help you.""
""These people make me see I have a new life.""

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-45419466,asylum seeker,825,13 September 2018,By Reality Check team,Reality Check: Are migrants driving crime in Germany?,"The claim: The deputy leader of the far-right party Alternative for Germany (AfD) said there had been ""447 killings and murders"" by illegal migrants in Germany last year.
Reality Check verdict: The German interior ministry says that in fact last year 27 illegal migrants either committed or attempted to commit murder or manslaughter. The 447 figure refers to killings or attempted killings by all asylum seekers and refugees, most of whom are in Germany legally. Overall crime in Germany has fallen to the lowest level since 1992, but there has been an increase in migrant crime.
In the past couple of weeks, the east German town of Chemnitz has seen tensions flare over the issue of migrants and crime.
Protests by the far right began after two migrants, a Syrian and an Iraqi, were arrested after a 35-year-old German man was stabbed to death in a fight on 26 August.
The next day a counter-protest started, marked by a concert in the city, against violence and xenophobia.
Then, on 9 September, there were rival far-right and left-wing demonstrations in Köthen, also in eastern Germany, after a German man died in an incident involving Afghan men.
Since Europe's huge 2015 influx of migrants and refugees more than 1.5 million asylum seekers have entered Germany. In that time, anti-migrant rhetoric has increased and so has support for the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party.
AfD deputy leader Beatrix von Storch told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""We've got 447 killings and murders by illegal migrants in the last year.""
According to Germany's Interior Ministry, 27 illegal migrants either committed or attempted to commit murder or manslaughter in 2017.
The 447 figure used by AfD actually refers to all asylum seekers and refugees, most of whom are in Germany legally.
Overall this group was 15% of the total 2,971 suspects linked to these crimes in Germany last year.
Bar a blip in the mid-2000s, overall crime has been decreasing in Germany since the early 1990s.
But that changed in 2015 - about the same time hundreds of thousands of refugees began entering the country.
In 2014, there were 6.1 million offences recorded by the police. By 2016, this had risen to 6.4 million - these figures include immigration violations which, inevitably, impact migrants.
Within that, violent crime rose from 180,000 cases to 193,000 between 2014 and 2016.
The number of murders increased by 14.6% and rapes by 8%, over the same period.
However, last year saw the total recorded crimes, including immigration violations, drop by 10%.
Equally, violent crime showed a 2.5% decrease between 2016 and 2017.
The AfD has made claims about a link between the influx of migrants and a rise in crime.
Since 2014, the proportion of non-German suspects in the crime statistics has increased from 24% to just over 30% (when we take out crimes related to immigration and asylum irregularities).
Breaking that down even further, in 2017 those classified as ""asylum applicants or civil war refugees or illegal immigrants"" represented a total of 8.5% of all suspects.
This is despite their population representing just 2% of Germany as a whole.
When it comes to violent crime, 10.4% of murder suspects and 11.9% of sexual offence suspects were asylum-seekers and refugees in 2017.
A government-backed analysis of the German state of Lower Saxony, which has taken the fourth-highest number of asylum seekers, showed there was an increase of violent crime by 10.4% between 2014 and 2016.
It analysed the crimes that had been solved, and attributed the overwhelming majority of the rise to migrants.
Criminologists say the make-up of the new arrivals is an important factor.
In 2014, German men between the ages of 14 and 30 made up 9% of the population and were responsible for half of all the country's violent crimes.
When it comes to the new arrivals, men aged 16 to 30 made up 27% of all asylum-seekers who came in 2015.
""It is because of the demographics,"" claims Dr Dominic Kudlacek, from the Criminological Research Unit of Lower Saxony. ""Whether they're asylum seekers or EU migrants, they are younger than the average population and mostly male. Young men commit more crimes in every society.""
Other factors also influence the trend, says Dr Kudlacek.
""They have social deprivation, they are alone and they spend most of their time with other people suffering from these risk factors - the accommodation of the majority of asylum seekers is like refugee camps with little privacy, which again can add to the likelihood of committing crimes.""
Asylum seekers in Germany face bureaucratic hurdles before they're allowed to find work, and while they receive some money from the state, it is limited.
Dr Kudlacek also points out that asylum seekers are often victims of crime as well.
A lot of the crime they commit, especially violent crime, they commit against other refugees.

Mr Turnbull had been under pressure from poor polling and what he described as an ""insurgency"" by conservative MPs.
Mr Morrison, the treasurer, won an internal ballot 45-40 over former Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton - who had been Mr Turnbull's most vocal threat.
Mr Turnbull is the fourth Australian PM in a decade to be ousted by colleagues.
""It has been such a privilege to be the leader of this great nation. I love Australia. I love Australians,"" he said on Friday.
With an election looming, MPs were nervous about the government's poor opinion polling and recent by-election defeats.
Last week, a row over energy policy ignited long-existing tensions between Mr Turnbull, a moderate, and his party's conservative wing.
Mr Dutton, a conservative, then unsuccessfully challenged Mr Turnbull on Tuesday, but his narrow defeat only stoked further discord.
Mr Morrison entered the race after Mr Turnbull lost key backers. After a majority of MPs called for a leadership ""spill"", Mr Turnbull agreed to step down.
To further complicate matters, Mr Turnbull has signalled he would resign from parliament, which would force a by-election and potentially put the government's one-seat majority at risk and force the new premier to call early elections.
However, Mr Morrison, who was sworn in on Friday, told reporters there were no plans to do this any time soon.
His government, he said, would be in place by next week.
Mr Morrison, a former Tourism Australia official, entered parliament in 2007 and has since held three key ministerial portfolios.
Speaking to reporters after the vote on Friday, Mr Morrison said he would be working to ""bring our party back together which has been bruised and battered this week"" and bring the country together.
He also said dealing with a severe drought, which has hit parts of eastern Australia, would be ""our most urgent and pressing need right now"".
With a mixture of bemusement, anger and sheer frustration: many have described this week as one of the most chaotic in Australian political history.
In his final press briefing, Mr Turnbull called the week ""madness"" and thanked his colleagues for choosing Mr Morrison over Mr Dutton.
""We have so much going for us in this country. We have to be proud of it and cherish it,"" he said.
Mr Dutton said: ""My course from here is to provide absolute loyalty to Scott Morrison, and make sure we win the election.""
Foreign Minister Julie Bishop was also in the running for the leadership, but did not make it to the final round.
Hywel Griffith, BBC News in Canberra
So Australia has its 30th prime minister, but how long before the 31st?
Scott Morrison faces an enormous task not just in healing the wounds within his party, but in winning the forgiveness of the public.
Many Australians have watched on exasperated, as normal government business was suspended to settle a political feud.
Given that an election must be called by May, Mr Morrison's biggest challenge will be convincing the electorate that he should stay in power.
If he doesn't succeed, expect yet another PM by June.
The past decade has been marked by a series of leadership coups, with three other sitting prime ministers deposed by party rivals.
Not a single leader in recent times has succeeded in serving a full term as prime minister, partly because elections come around so often - every three years - two years less than in the UK.
So in recent years, prime ministers unpopular in the polls - or with their colleagues - have been swiftly sacrificed from within.
Dave Sharma, a former Australian diplomat, says ""an election is always just around the corner, meaning members of parliament are forever focused on their electoral survival - and less so on the national interest"".
Writing in the Sydney Morning Herald, Mr Sharma says ""the steady drip of opinion polls and the relentless media cycle exacerbates the short-termism"".
Under the Australian system, as in the UK, the prime minister is not directly elected by voters but is the leader of the party or coalition that can command a majority in parliament."

Rioters at Villawood detention centre threw roof tiles and other objects at firefighters, preventing them from putting out the blazes.
The riot started with a rooftop protest from two detainees and spread to involve 100 people late on Wednesday.
Protests at Australia's detention centres have become more frequent as the number of asylum seekers has risen.
Immigration Department spokesman Sandi Logan said no injuries had been reported at Villawood.
Bryant: Riot fans flames of debate
Riot police had to be called in to restore order after the centre's unarmed guards retreated in the face of the riot.
""It took some time for the firefighters to be able to gain entry,"" he said.
""They had had roof tiles and other pieces of furniture being hurled at them by some of the detainees, so it was impossible for them to extinguish the blaze.
""But with the riot squad protection they were able to do that.""
A large gas cylinder exploded and a kitchen, laundry, medical facility and a computer centre were destroyed.

Immigration Minister Chris Bowen said many of those involved in the riot had had applications for asylum rejected.
""These are people, in many instances, who are not happy that they have not been accepted as refugees,"" he said.
Villawood detention centre holds both irregular maritime arrivals - people arriving in Australia by boat to seek asylum - and people already on the Australian mainland who have violated their visas or had them cancelled.
In recent months there have been a number of violent riots, suicides and self-harm attempts at Australian detention centres, says the BBC's Nick Bryant in Sydney.
There have been complaints from detainees about overcrowding and the length of time it takes to process their applications, our correspondent says.
An increase in the number of asylum seekers arriving by boat - mainly from Sri Lanka, Afghanistan and Iraq - has led to overcrowding at Christmas Island and other detention centres.
There was another riot at Christmas Island last month following a breakout.
Last year, rights group Amnesty International warned that the mental health of some of the asylum seekers held on Christmas Island was deteriorating because of uncertainty over their situation and the conditions in which they were being held.
The Australian government has recently announced the provision of more than 1,900 new beds for asylum seekers to ease crowding in detention centres.
Four hundred beds will be available in Pontville, southern Tasmania, within a month and another 1,500-bed facility at Wickham Point, Darwin, will open in mid-2011."

Salah Nashia, 52, carried out a ""prolonged and sustained"" hammer attack on Ghada Habib at her west London flat in September 2010.
He was ordered to serve a minimum of 19 years after being found guilty of murder.
Ms Habib, who was 5ft 2in, suffered 19 blows to her head during the attack.
Old Bailey jurors were told that, after the killing, Nashia searched her Perivale flat for money and stole a jewellery box which he used to try to seduce a woman.
Prosecutor Alex Lewis said: ""Towards the end of 2010 he was running out of time, running out of options.
""Either he could persuade Ghada to support him and his application to remain or he would have to return to Iraq, and Ghada was the sticking point - she was refusing to help him.""
The couple met through Nashia's brother in 2005, but the marriage was unsuccessful and Ms Habib, an artist, told the British authorities she had obtained a divorce.
Nashia successfully claimed asylum in the UK in 2008, and began visiting her, the court heard.
Nashia, from Ealing, west London, also claimed to be suffering from post-traumatic stress due to his time in the Iraqi army from 1978 to 1991, but prosecutors said there was no record of his military service.
Ms Lewis said: ""We say that this is not someone who was killed by a single blow or as a result of a brief loss of temper or self-control, but rather someone who died during a prolonged and sustained attack.""
Ms Habib, who had lived in the UK for 20 years, was a well-known artist in her native Iraq and throughout the Middle East.
She came to London in 1990 to have surgery to try to restore her hearing, but this was unsuccessful and she remained profoundly deaf.
Ms Habib decided to marry in 2005 because she felt vulnerable living alone with her disability."

An Eritrean man, aged 30, has been charged with his murder and remanded in custody.
On Monday night nine detectives carried out house-to-house inquiries. They are trying to trace a man seen walking his dog in Palm Street at the time.
Det Ch Insp Alastair Simpson said the dog-walker, who was seen in Palm Street between 2000 BST and 2100 BST on 4 April, could have vital information.
He said: ""Once again I'd like to thank members of the public who have taken the time to speak to police about what they saw last Monday night.

The Mounties used the form to screen refugee claimants entering into Quebec from the US.
Public Safety Canada says the document was ""inappropriate and inconsistent with government policy"".
Over 13,000 asylum seekers have crossed illegally into Canada since January, mostly into Quebec.
Canadian immigration and refugee lawyer Clifford McCarten provided the BBC with a copy of the document.
Many of the questions are standard, including queries related country of origin, basic health questions, and whether the respondent has friends or family in the US or Canada.
But it also includes questions about the refugee claimant's opinion on the so-called Islamic State and the Taliban and how they feel about women who do not wear religious head-coverings like the hijab and niqab.
Other questions asked more generally about affiliations with extremist or political groups, whether the respondent practises a religion and how often, and the person's opinion on religious freedom and equality between men and women.
A spokesman for federal Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale said they were ""immediately concerned"" after learning of the document and contacted the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP).
That version of the interview guide was only used in Quebec.
The RCMP did not immediately respond to requests for comment, but told the Toronto Star, which first reported on the guide, that it was designed to speed up processing at the border and to ""provide consistency in the RCMP's preliminary risk assessments"".
Responses were entered in the national police force's database.
When refugee claimants cross into Canada illegally they are apprehended, identified, searched and screened. If they are eligible to make an asylum claim, they are allowed entry and referred to immigration officials.
Canada saw an influx of refugee claimants crossing illegally into the country over the summer, up to 300 per day. The numbers have since tapered off.
Many that arrived in July and August were of Haitian origin but a number also came from African and Mideast nations."

Ako Amin, 19, was sentenced at the Old Bailey for strangling Cheryl Tariah in Barkingside, east London on 7 February.
The court heard the 17-year-old, of Chelmsford, Essex, visited him at his hostel and the couple rowed.
Amin, described as ""controlling"", hit the college student on the neck with a hammer before strangling her.
He was arrested three days later hiding in the back of a lorry at Dover, trying to flee the country.
Judge Richard Marks QC said during the sentencing: ""You were possessive, controlling and jealous and you were obsessed about her infidelity, although there is no evidence at all to substantiate the belief that you expressed that she was seeing anybody else.""
Amin was jailed for life with a minimum of ten-and-a-half years after pleading guilty to murder and told he will be deported back to Iran on his release.
The court was told he met Cheryl via a social networking website and for around a year they had an on-off relationship.
Her friends said he tried to control her, repeatedly accused her of being unfaithful and even hacked into her Facebook and email accounts to change the passwords so she could not send any messages.
Judge Marks said: ""This was a shocking incident in which a young woman has lost her life and the consequences to Cheryl Tariah's mother can only be imagined.
""She lost her husband in 2010 and is left by herself to look after a severely autistic son. No doubt Cheryl would have been a great comfort and support to her in that task but she no longer has that comfort and support through your selfish and wicked behaviour.
""I hope that you ponder for the rest of your life what you did that day for it was shocking and appalling and unforgivable.""
Amin arrived in the UK in December 2008 as an unaccompanied minor after his brother was murdered for his political beliefs in Iran.
He lived with a foster family and went to college, before moving to the hostel where he worked part-time and claimed benefits.
In mitigation, Jason Dunn-Shaw said: ""Despite the dreadful outcome he was extremely fond of this lady with whom he had entered his first relationship and he was and remains aghast at what happened.
""The fact of his rejection from this country the previous day may have been perhaps a contributing factor to this offence.
""He stole a young, innocent life and nothing can be done about that. He will always live with that memory and the horror of what he has done."""

Lawyers for Reza Yosefi, 20, told a Leeds court he would be at risk if deported as he has renounced Islam.
The administrative court granted an injunction to stop his deportation, which was due to take place hours later, while his case continues.
A previous attempt by the UK Border Agency to deport Mr Yosefi was blocked in November.
He is currently being held in a detention centre.
Mr Yosefi has lived in Sheffield for the past four years and claims he has no current ties to Afghanistan, though his parents were born there.
The UK Border Agency said he was not in need of protection and tried to remove him in November, but he appealed to the European Court of Human Rights.
That appeal was rejected and Mr Yosefi was detained again earlier this month.
He has now applied for a judicial review of the decision to reject his asylum application.
Mr Yosefi has claimed he grew up in Iran as the son of illegal Afghan refugees, before fleeing to the UK.
He said he arrived as an asylum seeker when he was 16, after a seven-month journey.
As a minor he was looked after by social services in Sheffield but once he turned 18 he was refused permission to remain indefinitely.
Mr Yosefi said that because his parents are considered illegal immigrants in Iran they have no Iranian citizenship and he has been told he must return to Afghanistan - but he has no family or friends there."

Mr Green said a letter from the UK Border Agency warning more than 1,000 people they might need to move house within days should not have been sent.
It stemmed from a dispute with Glasgow City Council over a contract to provide accommodation for asylum seekers.
Mr Green was giving evidence to the Commons Scottish Affairs Committee.
Hundreds of people protested in Glasgow after the UK Border Agency cancelled a contract with the city council to provide temporary housing for asylum seekers after they failed to agree on costs.
More than 600 families received letters warning them they could be re-homed, prompting the charity group, Positive Action in Housing (PAiH), to describe the move as ""utterly shameful"".
On Wednesday, the Commons Scottish Affairs Committee heard testy exchanges between the committee chair, Ian Davidson, and Mr Green, who conceded the letter had caused distress.
However, the same asylum seekers are due to be sent a further letter, as accommodation contracts with new providers are due to be entered into by March.
The local authority currently provides accommodation to more than 1,000 asylum seekers."

Kayte Cable, Ahmed Hassan's mentor the year before the September 2017 attack, said his lack of consent meant he was not properly engaged with the scheme.
Hassan, 18, injured 51 London commuters last year with his homemade explosive.
Police maintain that the Iraqi asylum seeker was co-operating with the programme at the time of the attack.
Surrey County Council, which was responsible for Hassan's care, said it ""didn't need"" his consent to enrol him in the Prevent scheme in 2016, as he was then underage.
The Metropolitan Police said Hassan appeared to be engaging with its Channel programme, part of the Prevent deradicalisation scheme, when he planted the bomb at the London Underground station a year later.
Channel operates on the basis that people regarded ""at risk"" agree to take part.
A council spokesman said: ""Because Hassan was under the age of 18, or claimed to be, we didn't need his consent to put him onto Channel.
""The county council gave consent on Hassan's behalf because he was under our care.""
Hassan's former volunteer mentor, college lecturer Ms Cable, told the BBC that lack of consent meant the teenager was not properly engaged with the programme intended to deradicalise him.
She said: ""It is a matter of conscience for me that we learn from this terrible event and do everything in our power to ensure that nothing like Parsons Green ever happens again.
""If we don't have complete transparency about what happened, I don't see how this is possible.""
He had been alerted to police and Prevent for comments made in a January 2016 immigration interview, when Hassan claimed he had been recruited by the Islamic State group in Iraq and had been ""trained to kill"".
Hassan, who arrived in the UK as a child asylum seeker, has been jailed for a minimum of 34 years after being found guilty of attempted murder."

Eliud Nyenze, who was being detained at Oakington, asked for paracetamol just before he died in April.
But the inquest ruled Kenyan Mr Nyenze died from natural causes probably caused by an irregular heartbeat.
The inquest was told the refusal of paracetamol would not have made a difference.
Mr Nyenze's death at Oakington immigration detention centre in April sparked protests by other detainees.

On Friday Birmingham City Council, part of a consortium with Wolverhampton, Dudley and Coventry, also withdrew from the agreement.
Dudley and Coventry councils have said they will remain in the consortium.
Coventry and Dudley provide 74 and 73 homes respectively.
Councillor Les Pugh, cabinet member for adults at Wolverhampton City Council, which currently has no party in overall control, said it had been a difficult decision to make but one that was in the interests of local people given the pressures on the housing list.
He said there were currently 13,405 people on the waiting list for council housing, of which 6,868 were in ""housing need"".
The UK Border Agency's regional director said it was ""disappointed"" at Wolverhampton's decision.
Dudley Council has said it will remain in the consortium until at least June 2012 while Coventry said it would honour its present commitment.
Councillor Tony Skipper, cabinet member for housing at the Labour-led council said: ""Birmingham was a key part of the consortium and it appears to me irresponsible to withdraw from this obligation at the last minute.

On Friday, about 300 asylum seekers left a former Australian-run detention centre on PNG's Manus Island in what the UN called a ""forcible removal"".
The men have expressed fears for their safety on Manus Island, where they are now housed in transit centres.
Doctors say they are ""deeply concerned"" about their physical and mental health.
Australia holds asylum seekers arriving by boat in offshore detention centres - a policy it says prevents drownings and human trafficking.
About 600 asylum seekers refused to leave the Manus Island camp when it closed on 31 October, with many spending weeks in squalid conditions after water and electricity were cut off.
""We are senior Australian clinicians who write in our individual capacity to express our concerns about the ongoing health and well-being of the former detainees,"" the doctors wrote in the open letter.
The doctors offered to fly specialists to the island, and has asked for Canberra to sanction the aid and give them diplomatic permission.
The letter was signed by prominent doctors including former Australian of the Year Prof Patrick McGorry, Medical Journal of Australia editor Prof Nick Talley, and Royal Australian College of General Practitioners president Prof Bastian Seidel.
The asylum seekers and refugees, all of whom are men, have been moved to alternative accommodation on the island. The Australian government says the sites are secure and have food and medical services.
However, the UN's refugee agency says medical care remains inadequate, noting that torture and trauma counselling services for the men - most of whom have refugee status - are ""completely unavailable"".
On Friday, it condemned allegations that asylum seekers were beaten with metal poles by PNG police as ""shocking and inexcusable"".
The Australian government described claims of violence as ""inaccurate and exaggerated"" and accused refugee advocates of stirring up trouble.
Canberra shut down the detention centre after a PNG court ruled it was unconstitutional."

However, Mr Justice Gerard Hogan said she could be transferred to Northern Ireland by road.
This was on the understanding that she will not be removed from the island of Ireland while awaiting the birth.
Rizwana Aslam, 27, arrived in the Irish Republic via the UK in February.
She applied for asylum, claiming that as a member of the Ahmadi faith, she would face religious persecution in Pakistan.
In September, she was told she would be transferred to the UK to apply for asylum there as it was her original point of entry into Europe.
Two months later she got a temporary injunction preventing her transfer on the grounds that she had entered a proxy marriage with a Pakistani man, Fakherr Udin, who has refugee status in Ireland.
In a written judgement handed down on Thursday, Mr Justice Gerard Hogan said that while Rizwana Aslam was not technically married under Irish law, she could be considered married under regulations governing asylum.
However, the case was complicated by her declaration that she was single in her original asylum application.
Mr Justice Hogan ruled it was too late for her to claim asylum in the Irish Republic on the basis of her proxy marriage.
The Irish state had sought to transfer her to the UK by ferry, but Mr Justice Hogan said that would represent a test of endurance which no heavily pregnant woman should face.

He was detained on Friday in Iraqi Kurdistan and police there say he confessed to the crime.
Armed and masked police officers escorted him to police headquarters in Wiesbaden on Saturday.
""I'm delighted that the suspect will be tried in Germany,"" Interior Minister Horst Seehofer said in a statement.
The case has renewed debate in Germany over immigration policy.
Police in Iraq's autonomous Kurdish region say they arrested Mr Bashar in his home region of Duhok after being contacted by the German authorities.
The girl's mother reported her missing on 23 May.
Susanna's body was found in a wooded area near a centre for asylum seekers where Mr Bashar and his family lived.
She had been strangled and sexually assaulted.
Chancellor Angela Merkel was widely criticised over her decision to open Germany's borders during Europe's refugee crisis in 2015. More than a million migrants arrived in the country as a result.
The backlash sparked by her policy helped fuel the country's far right in last year's election. The anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany (AfD) party entered the federal parliament for the first time.
Mrs Merkel's CDU-CSU conservative bloc and the Social Democrats (SPD) agreed to limit migration as part of a coalition deal.
Germany's interior minister is pressing ahead with controversial plans to hold asylum seekers in centres until their right to stay is determined.
A note on terminology: The BBC uses the term migrant to refer to all people on the move who have yet to complete the legal process of claiming asylum. This group includes people fleeing war-torn countries such as Syria, who are likely to be granted refugee status, as well as people who are seeking jobs and better lives, who governments are likely to rule are economic migrants."

Local media identified the man as Ismail Mirza Jan, 27, and said he would be deported on Saturday.
He is the first person to be repatriated under a deal struck between Canberra and Kabul in January.
Mr Jan says he no longer has family in Afghanistan and will be persecuted because he is Hazara, an ethnic group targeted by the Taliban.
He left Afghanistan in 2001 and arrived by plane in Australia last year, having had applications for asylum rejected in the UK and in Ireland.
He is currently being held in the Villawood detention centre in Sydney.
Australian immigration officials say they are satisfied he can be safely returned to Afghanistan.
""Arrangements have been made for an Afghan male who arrived in Australia on 16 February 2010 to be removed from Australia to Kabul, Afghanistan,"" the Department of Immigration and Citizenship said in a statement.
""His protection claims have been thoroughly examined by the department, by the refugee review tribunal and the Australian Federal Magistrates' court and he was found not to be a refugee.""
The man had been ""provided with advice of his removal"", the statement said.
Mr Jan told ABC News that he feared for his life because there was no-one to protect him in Afghanistan.
""I have no friends, no family there. So how can I live, relocate in Kabul?"" he said.
Ian Rintoul, of Australia's Refugee Action Coalition, said the move set ""a dangerous precedent"".
Afghans make up the largest number of asylum seekers arriving in Australia. Early this year, the two countries signed a deal allowing for the involuntary repatriation of failed asylum seekers.
Both main political parties are keen to appear tough on border control, but government asylum policy has been in crisis since a court ruled a plan to swap refugees with Malaysia unlawful.
Under the plan, Australia would have sent 800 asylum-seekers who arrived by boat on to Malaysia and would have received 4,000 refugees in return over four years.
But the court ruled that Malaysia - which has not signed UN refugee conventions - did not offer adequate protection.
This has thrown plans to process asylum-seekers offshore into disarray."

The 23-year-old failed asylum seeker had lived in Germany for eight years.
His body was found in temporary accommodation on Tuesday, six days after being flown to Kabul.
Political opponents called for Mr Seehofer to resign, saying he was unsuitable for the job.
""Hopefully his laughter has stuck in his throat... it's high time he goes,"" said left-wing Linke MP Jan Korte.
Mr Seehofer said the man's death was ""deeply regrettable"" but rejected calls to step down, saying the decision to deport him had been taken on a local level.
The unnamed man, originally from northern Afghanistan, had come to Germany as a minor. He had been living in Hamburg and had convictions for theft and resisting officers.
He was put on a flight on 4 July with 68 other failed asylum seekers, as part of a German programme to deport Afghans to areas of the country seen as safe. The policy is part of an EU-wide push to step up removal of failed asylum seekers.
He was given a temporary place to stay at a hotel run by the International Organization for Migration for returning migrants who have nowhere to go.
The 23-year-old is thought to have killed himself some time on Tuesday. The Pro Asyl charity said he had apparently been forced into a situation where he had no way out, and it warned there was a risk it might not be an isolated case.
Mr Seehofer made the comment as he was presenting his own ""migration masterplan"" on Tuesday.
Of the 69 migrants flown to Afghanistan, 51 had come from his home state of Bavaria, where he leads the centre-right Christian Social Union. According to official figures 148 Afghans have been deported this year.
""Of all things on my 69th birthday - and I didn't order this - 69 people were sent back to Afghanistan,"" Mr Seehofer remarked. ""That's way above the usual level so far.""
A controversial figure in the government, he sparked a row that threatened to bring Chancellor Angela Merkel down, by demanding tighter controls on the Bavarian border with Austria.
Gyde Jensen, chairman of the human rights committee in the German parliament, the Bundestag, said that judging from the cynicism of his remarks, Mr Seehofer was ""obviously in the wrong post"".
Another opposition figure, Claudia Roth, called for further deportations to Afghanistan to be halted due to ""the continuing disastrous security situation""."

He forced an internal party vote, hoping to unseat Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull.
The vote did oust Mr Turnbull, but Mr Dutton lost the race for the top job in a stunning upset to Scott Morrison, the current treasurer.
Mr Dutton is a polarising figure whose ministerial duties were last year expanded into a super portfolio - giving him considerable power.
He is a more hardline conservative than ex-prime minister Malcolm Turnbull and is best known for overseeing Australia's tough and controversial policies on asylum seekers.
Mr Dutton had alluded to such perceptions in a press briefing.
""It is good to be in front of the cameras where I can smile and maybe show a different side,"" he said.
Born in Brisbane, Mr Dutton spent nine years in the police force before being elected to the House of Representatives in 2001.
He has since occupied various ministries including health and sport, before taking over immigration in 2014.
Since then, Mr Dutton has been responsible for managing some of Australia's most divisive policies - including offshore detention for asylum seekers and refugees.
Canberra sends all asylum seekers who arrive by boat to islands in the Pacific and gives them no prospect of settling in Australia.
The policy has frequently drawn criticism from the UN and human rights groups, but Australia has insisted it saves lives at sea.
Mr Dutton told Fairfax Media in 2017: ""This is a tough portfolio... but I get a lot of professional satisfaction out of it.""
His reputation as a competent and respected minister within the government earned him a new super-portfolio based on the UK Home Office last year. In addition to immigration and border protection, Mr Dutton took on responsibility for all of Australia's domestic national security agencies.
Along the way he became the most senior conservative in Mr Turnbull's government.
Australia's second-longest serving prime minister, John Howard, has described Mr Dutton as a formidable and capable politician.
""He can clearly explain and justify the government's policies in an effective way. He's a very good communicator,"" Mr Howard told the Courier Mail last year (paywall).
In 2015 Mr Dutton was widely criticised for making light of rising sea levels affecting Pacific Island nations, after he was caught on camera joking about ""water lapping at your door"".
A year later, political journalist Samantha Maiden revealed Mr Dutton had called her a ""mad [expletive] witch"" in a text message. Mr Dutton later apologised.
He was also among several politicians who boycotted Australia's 2008 national apology to the Stolen Generations - a name given to tens of thousands of Aboriginal children who were forcibly taken from their families under infamous government policies until 1970.
Mr Dutton defended himself by saying the apology would not deliver ""tangible outcomes"" for children today. However, he later said he had overlooked the apology's significance.
In January, he controversially suggested people in Melbourne were ""scared to go out in restaurants"" because of African Australian street gangs - part of wider commentary that drew allegations of racist mischief-making.
A frequent critic of the left and focus of its scorn, Mr Dutton has become a ubiquitous subject of memes. In one famous instance, his staff asked for an ""unflattering"" Fairfax Media image - showing Mr Dutton half in shadow - to be taken down. But Twitter wasn't happy with this request and the picture went viral.
Mr Dutton had on 21 August launched an unsuccessful leadership challenge against Mr Turnbull, losing by a slim margin of 13 votes - causing him to resign from his cabinet position.
He vowed to continue challenging Mr Turnbull if he gained enough backing and on Friday, a second party vote was called.
Many observers had predicted that Mr Dutton's bid for the top job could still be successful.
Some believed that Mr Dutton could have picked up votes in his home state Queensland, which has several key marginal seats.
He was up against Foreign Minister Julie Bishop and Treasurer Scott Morrison - but ultimately lost to Mr Morrison by 40-45.
Under the Australian system, as in the UK, the prime minister is not directly elected by voters but is the leader of the party or coalition that can command a majority in parliament."

Natasha Shields, 18, screamed abuse as she pushed flaming tissue paper through the letter box of a house in Stockton occupied by a Kurdish family.
At Teesside Crown Court she admitted reckless arson, described in court as an ""ugly episode of racial harassment"".
Zanko Hamamin and his housemates filmed the attack from inside their home in Camden Street last July.
No-one was seriously hurt in the incident.
The court heard that Shields, of Moorbeck Way, Ormesby, was drunk at the time of the arson attack.
It also emerged that she had a previous conviction for arson for trying to burn down a children's home when she was 12.
Her lawyer, Andrew Turton, described her as a ""damaged and vulnerable person"" who would benefit from an alcohol treatment course.
Judge Peter Bowers told Shields that the incident, on 26 July last year, was an ""ugly episode of racial harassment."""

Osman Rasul Mohammed, 27, an Iraqi Kurd, had been in Britain for almost 10 years when an application to stay in the country was rejected.
The inquest in Nottingham heard he climbed on to the railing of a balcony in a distressed state in 2010.
Coroner Maureen Casey said a ""baying"" crowd below called on him to jump.
The inquest heard Mr Mohammed died at Clifford Court in Radford on 25 July last year after he became very distressed about his immigration status.
Mr Mohammed had originally applied for political asylum but that failed because he could not prove he had a legal right to stay.
His second attempt to stay was based on his children, who have British citizenship, but this also failed.
Friends said that in the weeks before his death he had tried to discuss his case with immigration officials. He had also heard his legal funding was going to be cut.
The inquest at Nottingham's Council House heard Mr Mohammed had cannabis in his system and appeared to be praying while on the balcony.
A neighbour and police spent more than two hours trying to persuade him to get help but he suddenly fell as taunts were shouted from below.
The Nottingham coroner said it was ""an horrific scene with a crowd baying for the vulnerable man to jump"".
Miss Casey said she could not record a verdict of suicide because it could not be proven he had jumped to his death.
But she said the issues over his legal status were not for the inquest hearing.
She recorded an open verdict."

The concert, in the market place of Apolda, Thuringia, was halted after an hour because of the violence.
Around 700 neo-Nazis attended the concert, which had been dubbed ""Rock Against the Overflow of Foreigners"".
A counter-demonstration earlier in the day attracted a similar number of people.
An ecumenical church service in protest at the concert was also held on Saturday, attended by Thuringia's first minister, minister of the interior and minister of the environment.
The concert was legal, but the violence began as people began arriving for the concert. As well as bottles being thrown, police used pepper spray on at least one demonstrator who tried to jump the barrier checks.
State police later tweeted that eight officers were slightly injured but had not needed hospital treatment.
The concert had been moved to Apolda at the last minute after it was banned from being held as planned in a nearby city.
Support for the far right is on the rise in eastern Germany. The arrival of more than one million refugees and asylum seekers since 2015 has divided the country.
About 23% of voters in Thuringia support the far-right, anti-immigration Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, according to a recent opinion poll commissioned by public broadcaster MDR.
The co-leader of the AfD in Thuringia, Björn Höcke, has condemned the Holocaust memorial in Berlin and is well-known for inflammatory marks on refugees and race.
Germany society has been deeply divided over the influx of more than one million migrants, mostly Muslims fleeing Middle East conflicts, after Chancellor Angela Merkel's decision in 2015 to let them in.
Since then, policy changes have led to a sharp fall in the number of people seeking asylum."

Mohammed Al-Sulaiti, who worked and studied at Swansea University while claiming asylum in the UK, was jailed last November.
The UK Border Agency confirmed he was deported back to Qatar on 2 June.
The agency said it would do all it could to prosecute and remove people who ""abuse their right to be here"".
The father-of-six entered the UK on a student visa in 2005, later claiming asylum, and signing a declaration saying his family had no cash, savings, investments or property.
He was given asylum support which included housing in Swansea, payment of all utility bills and up to £400 a week for his family.
However, UK Border Agency investigators discovered he had thousand of pounds in different bank accounts, as well as numerous business interests and financial investments.
Tuition fee payments
In May 2007 he began working illegally as a postgraduate research assistant at Swansea University's School of Medicine.
He provided false documents stating he had the right to work in the UK.
Al-Sulaiti also successfully applied for a bursary to pay for his tuition fees.
It is thought he fraudulently obtained financial support and accommodation worth £210,000 from the UK Border Agency, £33,000 in tuition fee payments from Swansea University and the Overseas Student Research Fund, as well as £10,000 in illegally-obtained wages from the university.
Jane Farleigh, regional director of the UK Border Agency in Wales, said: ""We will not accept foreign nationals like Al-Sulaiti breaking our laws.
Proceeds of crime
""He stole thousands of pounds from the public purse and people who commit serious offences of this nature should be deported at the earliest possible opportunity.""
Al-Sulaiti was arrested in March 2010.
He admitted benefit fraud during a trial at Cardiff Crown Court in October 2010 and was jailed for two years the following month.
His asylum claim was turned down before the trial. His wife and children were removed to Qatar in April 2010.
The UK Border Agency said more than £27,000 was recovered from Al-Sulaiti under proceeds of crime legislation before his deportation."

Barbara-Ann Ennis, 40, needed three operations to repair the wound and had to wait six months before being given the all-clear over HIV.
Ms Ennis, an army veteran who served in Bosnia and Iraq, was scarred for life by the attack at Gatwick Airport.
Her former employer, G4S, said it could not comment on the ruling.
Lawyers for Ms Ennis said that after the attack in August 2006, it emerged the detainee, Sylvia Fileingoshisho, had bitten another officer just days earlier.
An error meant Ms Ennis was unaware of the previous attack, which happened as the detainee was moved from Yarl's Wood Immigration Removal Centre in Bedford to the West Sussex airport.
Ms Fileingoshisho was later jailed for three years and deported.
""Since the attack, my life's been like a living nightmare I can't wake up from,"" said Ms Ennis, from Ashford, Kent.
""The trauma of thinking that, through no fault of my own, I'd been infected by a truly dreadful and life changing disease...and enduring a six-month wait to find out my fate has been torturous.
""I want to compel employers to take every step possible to protect workers so what happened to me can never happen to anyone ever again.""
Ms Ennis left her job because of her physical and psychiatric injuries at the end of 2007. The compensation was awarded in an out-of-court settlement.
Her lawyer, Natasha Lewis, of Irwin Mitchell, said the damages would enable Ms Ennis to rebuild her life.
""Barbara-Ann's injuries have had a devastating impact on her social and professional life,"" she said.
""To learn that another officer had suffered a similar attack just days before, and that still precautionary measures had not been put in place to protect staff against a clearly violent and dangerous individual has been a serious cause for concern.""
G4S said in a statement: ""We will not comment on the ruling itself.
""However, the safety and security of our employees and those within our care is paramount to our operations.

Samim Bigzad, 22, had been living in Ramsgate, Kent, after entering the UK illegally two years ago in order to join his father who was granted asylum.
The injunction was granted while Mr Bigzad was waiting for a connecting flight to Kabul at Istanbul airport.
Ms Rudd told the Andrew Marr Show: ""I will make sure we do the right thing.""
She added that she took the matter ""very seriously"" and ""I will look carefully at the information and make sure we abide by the law as we always do"".
Jamie Bell, from law firm Duncan Lewis, which is representing Mr Bigzad, said he was being flown back to the UK and was due to arrive in London at 20:45 BST on Sunday.
Mr Bell told the BBC that the High Court injunction was granted by Justice Morris at 21:55 BST on Tuesday and the Home Office was informed at 22:00 - 30 minutes before Mr Bigzad's flight to Kabul was scheduled to depart.
He said the Home Office had made an application to the Court of Appeal for Mr Bigzad to stay in Kabul but it was refused.
Mr Bell added: ""We have now commenced contempt of court proceedings against the Home Office for their decision to put him on the flight despite the order from Mr Justice Morris.""
Lord Falconer, the former Labour Secretary of State for Justice, tweeted: ""Bigzad case suggests HO comply with court orders only if they agree with them. Wrong. Courts decide cases, not HO.""
On Wednesday, Mr Bigzad told the BBC he feared for his life and had contacted the British Embassy in Kabul requesting an airline ticket back to the UK as soon as possible.
""I am scared of the Taliban,"" he said.
His father, for whom Mr Bigzad is the main carer, has lived in Margate for 10 years, and suffers from Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome (PTSD)."

The UK Border Agency (UKBA) terminated its deal with Glasgow City Council in November, saying it was too expensive.
UKBA was criticised for mishandling the issue after a poorly-worded letter suggested hundreds of families may have to leave their homes within days.
The contract will now be taken on by Y People - formerly YMCA.
Glasgow City Council said it had approved a deal to transfer asylum seeker accommodation and support staff to Y People.
Under the terms of the deal, more than 1,000 asylum seekers will be able to remain in their current accommodation while their claims are processed.
Jobs for those working in the council's asylum support will also be protected with about half being seconded to Y-People and the remainder being redeployed with the council's social work services.
The UK Border Agency has agreed to cover the cost of these staff until they are redeployed.
Councillor Elaine McDougall, chair of the council's asylum working group, said the deal would preserve existing arrangements and save jobs.
""Our priority was always to ensure continuity for asylum seekers and that has been achieved,"" she said.
""It has been widely acknowledged that UKBA's decision to terminate the contract led to a lot of concern among asylum seekers.
""But thanks to the council's persistence asylum seekers will be able to remain in Glasgow as they await decisions on their status with jobs also protected.""
Joe Connolly, chief executive of Ypeople, said: ""Our objective throughout the process has been to ensure the minimum amount of disruption to service users.
""We would like to reassure them that Ypeople will deliver a service which fully meets their needs.""
Asylum seekers in the city held several demonstrations after being sent the controversial letter in November.
The charity group, Positive Action in Housing, describe it as ""utterly shameful"".
And the Scottish Affairs Committee at Westminster later described the agency's handling of the issue as ""inappropriate at best and inhumane at worst"".
UK immigration minister Damien Green later apologised for the ""inappropriateness"" of the letter."

She added: ""There is a small part of me that cares about him because I know he has mental health issues"".
Hassan will be sentenced this week.
Mrs Jones and her husband Ron, who have fostered hundreds of children over five decades, gave Hassan a home after he arrived in the UK as an asylum seeker from Iraq.
They said they had no idea about the teenager's plan.
While the couple were away, Hassan made 400g of explosives and packed the device with nearly 2.2kg of screwdrivers, knives, nuts and bolts.
Mrs Jones added: ""I am cross with him for what he's done, and that he's done this in my house makes me feel very, very betrayed, I can't help that.
""Because he's such a bright and intelligent child, he'd got a good future ahead of him. I find this hard.""
In court, the jury heard that he wanted to avenge the death of his father in Iraq and was ""disappointed"" when the bomb only partly detonated.
Mr Jones said he still struggled to accept what his foster son did. ""He was so convincing and I didn't have no cause to be suspicious of anything he had done,"" he said."

The European Parliament last month approved disciplinary action against Viktor Orban's government, which denies its actions breached EU ""core values"".
Conservatives voted against the motion, saying they did not want to interfere with Hungary's ""internal democracy"".
But former US First Lady Mrs Clinton called the decision ""disheartening"".
The 2016 Democratic presidential candidate has been marking the 70th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights at the Bonavero Institute of Human Rights at the University of Oxford.
In a wide-ranging speech on Tuesday, Mrs Clinton said: ""It's disheartening to watch conservatives in Brussels vote to shield Viktor Orban from censure, including British Tories.
""They have come a long way since the days of Margaret Thatcher and Winston Churchill.""
Since coming to power, Mr Orban's government has taken a hardline stance against immigration, making it a criminal offence for lawyers and activists to help asylum seekers.
It prompted two-thirds of the European Parliament to back disciplinary action, amid reports of pressure being put on Hungary's courts and electoral system.
British Conservative MEPs supported the Hungarian government, arguing that the EU had intruded into purely national matters.
Afterwards, Environment Secretary Michael Gove told the BBC it did not amount to an endorsement of Mr Orban, saying the MEPs were observing a ""long-standing principle"" on sovereignty.
In her speech Mrs Clinton described Hungary's democracy as a ""masquerade"", saying ""illiberal democracy is a contradiction in terms"".
""Democracy also requires free expression and a free press, the rule of law and an independent judiciary. Without these things illiberal democracy is no democracy at all, it is just authoritarianism by another name.""
Mrs Clinton, who lost the 2016 presidential contest to Donald Trump, told the audience his US administration had shown ""hostility to civil rights"".
""The president is degrading rule of law, delegitimising our elections, spreading corruption, undermining our national unity, and discrediting truth, facts, and reason itself,"" she said.
""Our divisions even make us targets for foreign manipulation, which seeks to sow chaos and pit us against each other.""
She described new threats, ""at the intersection of technology and autocracy"" and accused Russian President Vladimir Putin of using hackers and propagandists to advance an extreme right-wing agenda.
""The whole world now knows that Putin is waging cyber warfare and manipulating social media to influence elections, and referenda, and to polarise and cripple democracies across the West,"" she added.
On Monday, Mrs Clinton unveiled a statue at the Bonavero Institute honouring wartime US First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt's championing of human rights."

Reza Yosefi, 20, has lived in Sheffield for the past four years but is due to be removed from the UK to Afghanistan on Tuesday morning.
Mr Yosefi's family originate from Afghanistan but he was born in Iran and has never lived there.
The UK Border Agency said Mr Yosefi's case had been carefully considered.
Campaigners fear he will be killed if he is sent to the war-torn country.
Mr Yosefi grew up in Iran as the son of illegal Afghan refugees before fleeing to the UK.
He said in Iran he was not allowed to go to school and when he tried to work he was arrested and badly beaten by police.
He moved to the UK as an asylum seeker when he was 16, a journey which took him seven months.
As a minor he was looked after by social services in Sheffield but once he turned 18 he was refused permission to remain indefinitely.
Because his parents are considered illegal immigrants in Iran they have no Iranian citizenship and Mr Yosefi has been told he must return to Afghanistan despite having no family or friends there.
Speaking from the Harmondsworth detention centre, Mr Yosefi said: ""I've made a life here, I've got friends here.
""I'm feeling dire. I'm just thinking when are they going to take me to Afghanistan. Where am I going to sleep on a night time when I'm there.
""They say I am from Afghanistan because of my family... I have never been to Afghanistan but I imagining it is a violent place.""
Campaigners have urged people to email the Home Secretary to support Mr Yosefi.

He told the UK Border Agency he could not support a wife and six children but he had bank accounts and investments.
He was called ""thoroughly dishonest"" and will be deported after jail.
Al-Sulaiti's deception began when he entered the UK on a student visa in 2005.
He claimed asylum and during his application he signed a form declaring that his family had no cash, savings, investments or property.
He was given asylum support by the UK Border Agency, which is intended for asylum seekers who would otherwise be destitute.

He was arrested at his house in Manselton, Swansea on 30 March after officers were alerted by officials from the agency's asylum support team.
Al-Sulaiti was charged with benefit fraud and was being tried when he pleaded guilty in the middle of his trial on 4 October.
Jailing him, Judge Stephen Hopkins QC said: ""You are 35 years of age, a paramedic, intelligent, well educated and fluent in English - you are also thoroughly dishonest and devious,

The body, which was set up to improve equality, said the concerns highlighted in its previous reviews were still evident.
The EHRC's Scotland Commissioner Lesley Sawers said: ""Fairness should be at the heart of Scottish society.
""This review suggests that there is still some way to go.""
The report highlighted differences in educational attainment, health, work opportunities and living standards among social groups.
It said women were less likely to be in work and they continued to earn less than men on average.
It also said those women who were in work continued to experience sexual harassment as well as discrimination related to pregnancy.
Meanwhile, disabled people were twice are likely to be unemployed and more likely to live in poverty, according to the review.
It also said differences in school attainment were evident as early as Primary 1, especially for children living in the most deprived areas.
Ms Sawyers said, despite much good work by the Scottish government and other agencies, there was risk that disadvantages could become entrenched.
The EHRC's ""Is Scotland Fairer?"" report is published every three years and looks at six areas - education, work, living standards, health, justice and participation.
It concluded that progress was not consistent or widespread.
It says: ""We acknowledge that effecting change requires a long-term commitment and it can take many years before any change is apparent. However, the evidence in this review suggests a general stagnation in progress.
""We need to recognise where, and question why, stagnation is happening.""

Nazi signs and symbols, including the Hitler salute, are illegal in Germany.
On Thursday the Chemnitz court gave a suspended eight-month term to a 33-year-old man for making Hitler salutes.
He was also ordered to pay a €2,000 (£1,780; $2,326) fine.
The man jailed on Friday had a string of previous convictions, including for physical violence, so a suspended term was ruled out.
Chemnitz has seen a series of far-right demonstrations - attended by thousands - and smaller leftist counter-demonstrations since the stabbing of Daniel H on 26 August.
Two male asylum seekers - a Syrian and an Iraqi - have been detained in connection with the killing. Police are searching for a third suspect, who is also a migrant.
There was outrage in Germany over assaults and racist insults linked to the Chemnitz protests.
Far-right groups, including the main opposition party - Alternative for Germany (AfD) - are furious that more than a million asylum seekers who reached Germany in 2015-2016 were allowed to remain.

In order to claim asylum in the UK, refugees must have left their home country and be unable to return for fear of persecution.
While their claims are assessed, people can apply for housing - it could be a flat, a house, a hostel or a bed and breakfast, anywhere in the country - and an allowance to pay for food and other necessities. They are not generally allowed to work.
Successful applicants are given ""leave to remain"" in the UK as a refugee for five years, after which - if the situation in their home country has not improved - they can then apply to settle in the UK more permanently.
Those who are not successful are asked to leave the country, although there is a window in which appeals can be lodged.
They are encouraged to leave voluntarily, but legally they can be detained without warning at an immigration removal centre and forced to leave the UK.
Serco Group is a private outsourcing firm which provides public services on behalf of governments and local authorities. It operates in countries across the world, from building Antarctic icebreaker ships to operating the metro system in Dubai.
In the UK alone it works across a huge range of areas, from transport and hospitals to prisons and the military. In Scotland, it runs HMP Kilmarnock, works with NHS boards in Forth Valley and Dumfries and Galloway, and has signed a deal to deliver a bike-hire scheme in Edinburgh.
Another of Serco's contracts is from the Home Office, to provide accommodation and support services for people while their asylum claims are being processed.
It manages a ""significant property portfolio"" across the country, which it uses to house asylum seekers while their claims work their way through the system - a process which can sometimes take years.
Chief executive Rupert Soames claimed in 2016 that the firm was ""not going to make money on this contract"", but said it was willing to pay this cost because ""we feel very passionately about looking after asylum seekers well"".
Serco provides accommodation for about 5,000 people in Scotland, almost all of them in Glasgow.
The majority of these are awaiting the outcome of their asylum claims, but some - currently around 330 - are no longer receiving any funding support from the Home Office.
About a third of these people have been granted leave to remain in the UK, and the rest have been refused asylum.
The number of people staying on unfunded by the Home Office has almost doubled since last August, and Serco says it can no longer afford to effectively put them up for free - having lost £80m on the asylum accommodation contract over the last five years.
It also says there is no longer any room for new asylum claimants arriving in Glasgow, claiming that new arrivals ""have to be put in hotels"".
The firm is now seeking to ""move on"" some of the unsuccessful applicants, and have threatened to change the locks on their doors in a bid to force them to leave.
Word of the lock-changing plan provoked an outcry, with groups and charities backing the asylum seekers saying Serco was seeking to evict vulnerable people from their only place of shelter.
Housing charity Shelter Scotland said making people homeless was not the way forward, calling it a ""deplorable and inhuman course of action"".
Two asylum seekers from Afghanistan went on hunger strike, and protests were staged outside Home Office offices in Glasgow.
Housing associations which lease buildings to Serco have spoken out, and the local council made three separate pleas to the Home Office, saying that making hundreds of people destitute could cause a ""humanitarian crisis"".
The Scottish government has also weighed in, with First Minister Nicola Sturgeon saying she was ""appalled"" by the move and urging the Home Office to be ""humane"" with asylum seekers.
Serco has now paused the planned lock changes after legal challenges were lodged.
On Monday, housing charity Shelter Scotland filed papers at Glasgow Sheriff Court on behalf of two people, seeking to prevent the lock-changes. The Legal Services Agency was also in court on behalf of a third individual.
The issue is also due to be raised at the Court of Session in Edinburgh after a case was lodged by the Govan Law Centre.
Shelter says their clients are ""actively working with immigration lawyers to resolve their asylum claims"", and should be allowed a home to live in while this is ongoing.
Both sides have welcomed the court action, with Serco saying it should provide clarity ""as to how the law will apply to people who refuse to move on from the free accommodation provided to them"".
They say their approach is ""fully within the law"", and hope the court will confirm this position."

Josep Borrell, also a former President of the European Parliament, disagreed with the strategy.
The comments came during a visit Mr Borrell made to the US at the end of June.
Mr Trump's pledge to build a wall between the US and Mexico was one of his best-known election promises.
Mr Borrell recounted his conversation with the US president at a lunch event in Madrid this week, Spain's foreign ministry confirmed to the BBC.
""The border with the Sahara cannot be bigger than our border with Mexico,"" Mr Borrell quoted Mr Trump as saying.
The US-Mexico border is 1,954 miles (3,145 km) long. The Sahara desert stretches for 3,000 miles.
Spain has no sovereignty over the Sahara, but it does possess two small enclaves on the north African coast, Ceuta and Melilla, separated from Morocco by controversial wire fences.
The enclaves have become magnets for African migrants seeking a better life in Europe and refugees fleeing persecution and conflict.
Since January of this year, at least 35,000 undocumented migrants have arrived in Spain, the highest number received by any Mediterranean EU country.
However, Germany - the most popular EU destination for migrants - has been registering more than 10,000 asylum-seekers a month this year."

That is well over four times the number of asylum seekers that arrived in Quebec from the United States in the month of June.
Canada has had a surge of refugee claimants in recent months, especially into the French-speaking province.
It is trying to stem the tide with the warning that landing in Canada is not an automatic ticket into the country.
Both provincial and federal officials are concerned that misinformation about Canada's refugee system is being propagated through social media, helping fuel the influx.
""Asking for asylum in Canada is not a guarantee for permanent residence in Canada, and it's extremely important we stress that,"" Louis Dumas, a spokesman for Canada's immigration department, said on Thursday.
A majority of those arriving in the current wave are from Haiti and were living legally in the US.
In May, US President Donald Trump announced that the US would end the programme that extended temporary protection from deportation to Haitian citizens after the devastating 2010 earthquake. That protection is due to expire in January 2018.
Canadian officials noted that just about 50% of refugee bids by Haitian nationals in 2016 were successful, and the rest of the people were deported.
Montreal temporarily opened its Olympic Stadium as a shelter to host the sudden increase in asylum seekers, and provincial resources are being strained by the numbers.
The Canadian military has built a camp to temporarily house those who have crossed until they have been processed by law enforcement and immigration officials.
The camp would house up to 500 asylum seekers in Saint-Bernard-de-Lacolle, Quebec, near Plattsburgh, New York.
Federal Transportation Minister Marc Garneau, speaking on Thursday at the border at Saint-Bernard-de-Lacolle, said the government is able to manage the situation despite the fact ""it's out of the ordinary"".
Once in custody, migrants are identified, searched and screened. If they are eligible to make an asylum claim, they are allowed entry and referred to the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada.
Between 1 January and 31 July, more than 7,500 people crossed into Canada illegally seeking refugee status, 6,360 of them to Quebec."

Police shot him in the leg and he is in hospital, but he is expected to appear in court via a video link on Tuesday.
The man appeared to choose women as targets, police said, in a rampage on Friday in Turku, south-western Finland. It is being treated as terrorism.
Two Finnish women were stabbed to death. Eight other people were injured.
The injured - six of them women - included a British paramedic, a Swede and an Italian.
The paramedic, Hassan Zubier, took part in a minute's silence for the victims on Sunday at a makeshift memorial in Turku's market square.
He is still having hospital treatment for his stab wounds, but turned up in a wheelchair. ""I am not a hero. I did what I was trained for. I did my best and more,"" he said. He had gone to the aid of a woman who later died.
Police detained four other Moroccan men over possible links to the attack.
Finnish broadcaster YLE says Mr Mechkah was living until recently at a reception centre for asylum seekers, and he arrived in Finland last year.
The ages of the casualties ranged from 15 to 67.
Prime Minister Juha Sipila told a news conference that Finland had experienced a terrorist attack for the first time.
Crista Granroth, from the National Bureau of Investigation, said: ""It seems that the suspect chose women as his targets, because the men who were wounded were injured when they tried to help, or prevent the attacks.""
In addition to the four other arrests, an international search warrant has been issued for a sixth suspect.
Police said the alarm was raised at 16:02 local time (13:02 GMT) on Friday, when a man was reported to have attacked passers-by with a knife.
Witnesses said he then ran to a nearby square and stabbed more people before he was shot in the thigh. Police said he was arrested at 16:05."
http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-australia-41813219,asylum seeker,576,31 October 2017,None,Manus: Timeline of controversial Australian detention centre,"Australia's detention centre on Manus Island has often drawn criticism since it was re-opened in 2012. This is a timeline of key events.
2001: The camp first opens under Australian Prime Minister John Howard's so-called Pacific Solution, a policy of deterring asylum seekers.
2008: The centre is formally closed in 2008 under Prime Minister Kevin Rudd.
November 2012: It is re-opened by Prime Minister Julia Gillard after a spike in asylum seeker arrivals becomes a major political issue for her Labor government.
July 2013: Mr Rudd, who returned as prime minister, announces that asylum seekers who arrive by boat will never have the option of settling in Australia - a significant toughening of the policy.
August 2013: Australia agrees to give Papua New Guinea A$400m (£230m; $310m) in aid in exchange for housing the camp and agreeing to resettle refugees.
February 2014: Iranian asylum seeker Reza Barati, 23, is murdered inside the detention centre. Mr Barati was struck with wood and a rock when riots broke out and locals entered the facility. Another 70 asylum seekers were injured.
An Australian Senate report later finds that the riots were ""eminently foreseeable"" because the centre had experienced a rapid influx of detainees, stretching it beyond its intended capacity.
Two PNG men are later found guilty of Mr Barati's murder and sentenced to 10 years in jail, with five years of that term suspended. Detainees claim others had been involved in the murder.
September 2014: Iranian asylum seeker Hamid Khazaei, 24, dies from an infection after cutting his foot, raising questions about whether he received sufficient medical attention.
January 2015: Some detainees barricade themselves inside the compound and go on a hunger strike.
March 2015: Prime Minister Tony Abbott says he is ""sick of being lectured"" by the UN over Australia's treatment of asylum seekers, reiterating the nation's bipartisan stance that its policy saves lives at sea.
April 2016: PNG's Supreme Court rules that the centre is illegal because personal liberty is guaranteed under the nation's constitution. PNG Prime Minister Peter O'Neill calls for the centre to be closed.
December 2016: Sudanese refugee Faysal Ishal Ahmed, 27, dies after suffering a seizure and a fall. Refugee advocates claimed he had been ill for months.
April 2017: Nine people are injured when PNG defence personnel fire ""many"" shots into the compound, Australian authorities later confirm.
Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull's government claims the incident was sparked by anger over claims that a local boy had been led towards the centre by asylum seekers, but this version of events is then disputed by PNG Police Commissioner David Yapu. Mr Yapu says nothing had happened to the boy.
June 2017: The Australian government and its contractors offer compensation totalling A$70m (£41m; $53m) to refugees and asylum seekers who claimed they had suffered harm while in detention on the island.
August 2017: Iranian asylum seeker Hamed Shamshiripour is found dead in a suspected suicide.
September 2017: The US accepts 22 refugees from Manus Island, its first intake under a resettlement deal.
2 October 2017: A Sri Lankan refugee is found dead in another suspected suicide.
October 2017: The UN's refugee agency warns that Australia's withdrawal could create a ""humanitarian emergency"", while Human Rights Watch urges Canberra to consider sending police to assist with the transition.
31 October 2017: Hundreds of refugees and asylum seekers refuse to leave the centre, citing fears for their safety in the local community, as water and electricity is disconnected."
http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-39552691,asylum seeker,446,7 June 2018,None,Stockholm truck attack: Who is Rakhmat Akilov?,"The man convicted of ploughing a truck into a department store in central Stockholm, killing five people, had been denied residency in Sweden and had expressed sympathy for so-called Islamic State (IS).
Rakhmat Akilov, an Uzbek asylum seeker, ran from the scene still covered in blood and glass on 7 April 2017, and was arrested hours later in a northern suburb of Stockholm.
He was jailed for life for terrorist crimes in June 2018.
After his arrest, a picture of Akilov started to emerge: someone who had failed in his bid to get residency, lost his job and was hiding from police who wanted to deport him.
Bumping into a former colleague, he revealed he was spending his days ""sleeping and smoking"".
He had left his wife and four children behind in Uzbekistan, and earned money to send home to them.
Akilov had applied for residency in 2014 but had been informed in December 2016 that ""he had four weeks to leave the country"", police official Jonas Hysing said. He did not leave and, in February, was officially put on a wanted list.
A few months earlier he had reportedly lost his job after falling asleep at work.
He had been working in construction and was employed by Pierre Svensson for several weeks in 2016, helping on an asbestos removal project.
Akilov was, he said, ""a reserved person"".
""He didn't stick out. He did his job. You can't say he was very sociable, we just told him what to do and he did it. He didn't speak much Swedish,"" he told news agency AFP.
Akilov was also described as not being particularly religious. One has suggested he ""partied and drank"", which goes against strict Islamic doctrine.
""He never talked about politics or religion,"" one friend told Swedish daily Aftonbladet. ""He didn't pray five times a day from what I know.""
A co-worker agreed, telling news agency Reuters: ""He was like any normal guy.""
Online, it seems, it was a different story.
His Facebook page - which has since been taken down - was linked to a number of extremists through friends and featured at least two propaganda videos linked to IS, one reportedly showing the aftermath of the Boston bombing.
He also liked a page called ""Friends of Libya and Syria"", which says it aims to expose ""terrorism of the imperialistic financial capitals"" of the US, British and Arab ""dictatorships"".
However, he was also a fan of pages dedicated to Playboy magazine and Russian tennis player Maria Sharapova.
Despite all this, Akilov was not considered a threat by Swedish security services, who dismissed him as a ""marginal character"", apparently on the fringes of larger extremist movements."
http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-40714946,asylum seeker,841,26 July 2017,By Bethany Bell,"EU migrant crisis: Austria can deport asylum seekers, court says","The EU's top court has ruled that a law requiring refugees to seek asylum in the first country they reach applies even in exceptional circumstances.
The case, brought by Austria and Slovenia, could affect the future of several hundred people who arrived during the migrant crisis of 2015-16.
The ruling concerns two Afghan families and a Syrian who applied for asylum after leaving Croatia.
The court says it is Croatia's responsibility to decide their cases.
The crisis unfolded during the summer of 2015, as one million migrants and refugees travelled through the Western Balkans.
Under the so-called Dublin regulation, refugees typically have to seek asylum in the first EU state they reach. But Germany suspended the Dublin regulation for Syrian refugees, halting deportations to the countries they arrived in.
From August 2015, hundreds - and sometimes thousands - arrived in Austria every day, initially via Hungary and later through Slovenia.
Many wanted to travel on to Germany, but around 90,000 applied for asylum in Austria, equivalent to about 1% of its population.
Among them were two Afghan sisters, Khadija and Zainab Jafari, and their children who arrived at the Austrian border in February 2016.
According to Stephan Klammer, a lawyer from the Diakonie charity, ""they came through the organised transports from the Austrian and other governments"".
""They came from Macedonia in a few days directly to Austria. At the Austrian border the Jafari sisters were allowed in because they said they wanted to go to Austria and ask for asylum,"" he said.
But unlike many other Afghans, they were not granted asylum.
The Austrian authorities eventually decided that they should be deported back to Croatia, their point of entry to the EU, under the Dublin regulation.
Mr Klammer said: ""In some cases, the authorities said 'We are not responsible because of the Dublin procedure, Croatia is responsible'. So the Jafaris got this decision.""
The Jafari sisters' case was taken to the European Court of Justice (ECJ), along with a similar incident in Slovenia involving a Syrian national.
First there was a real welcome feeling in Austria, but the situation changed. Pressure grew, so the authorities thought about how they could handle the number of asylum procedures""
On Wednesday the ECJ ruled that their crossing of the Croatian border had to be considered irregular under the Dublin rule. Just because one EU country allows a non-EU citizen to enter its territory on humanitarian grounds, that authorisation is not valid in other EU countries.
Austrian lawyer Clemens Lahner said that hundreds of asylum seekers would be affected by the ECJ's decision. ""For those already in Croatia - 700 or so - for them the story is over. Austria won't take them back.""
But the fate of others is unclear.
Farzad Mohammadi from Afghanistan came to Austria in February 2016 when he was 17 years old. He was deported back to Croatia last November.
""It was very difficult. I had tried so hard. I was in a choir, I played football, I was doing a German course, I did everything I could, but they said that is the law - you have to go,"" he told the BBC.
However, he was allowed to return to Austria pending the court decision.
""Croatia was very bad, worse than Austria. We only had a thin blanket, there were problems with the heating. The toilets were dirty. Very very difficult.""
In its ruling the ECJ stressed that EU countries could show a ""spirit of solidarity"" under a sovereignty clause that allows member states to examine asylum applications even if they do not have to.
Lawyer Clemens Lahner told the BBC that for ""those whose asylum claims have been frozen, technically they can be sent back but the court reminds states they can show solidarity or leniency"".
In response to the big migrant influx, the EU agreed to relocate 160,000 refugees from Italy and Greece, the two countries that have seen the biggest number of arrivals.
However, only 24,600 people have been relocated so far, according to an EU report published on Wednesday.
Although the pace of relocations has improved, two countries have refused to take any refugees, Poland and Hungary. The Czech Republic has not taken anyone since 2016 and Austria has only recently agreed to accept refugees.
Hungary along with Slovakia and Poland called for the relocation policy to be scrapped, but their complaint received a setback from an ECJ legal adviser on Wednesday.
The advocate general recommended that the objection be thrown out, partly because the policy helped ""relieve the considerable pressure on the asylum systems of Italy and Greece following the migration crisis in the summer of 2015"".
A note on terminology: The BBC uses the term migrant to refer to all people on the move who have yet to complete the legal process of claiming asylum. This group includes people fleeing war-torn countries such as Syria, who are likely to be granted refugee status, as well as people who are seeking jobs and better lives, who governments are likely to rule are economic migrants."
https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-australia-45314575,asylum seeker,306,26 August 2018,None,Australia: Illegal boat runs aground in Queensland crocodile swamp,"An illegal fishing boat has run aground and been found abandoned in crocodile-infested waters in northern Queensland, Australia.
Authorities have found 11 people and think more are hiding in mangroves near Daintree, north of Cairns.
It is unknown if those on board were illegally fishing or if they are refugees, but border force officers are on the scene.
About 40 people are thought to have been on board, reports say.
The Department of Home Affairs said the first priority was to confirm all those on the boat were safe.
Queensland state MP Michael Healy told ABC News that the situation was unclear but officers were at the scene.
""We don't know whether these are illegal refugees or we don't know if these are fishermen who were maybe fishing illegally and have ended up in Australian waters and the boat's gone bad and they've got trapped,"" he said.
Local Mayor Julia Leu told ABC there was concern that people were ""putting themselves at risk in known crocodile habitat"".
Some reports say the 11 men rescued are Vietnamese, while others say they are Filipino.
If the boat was carrying asylum seekers, it would be the first successful landing by such a vessel in Australia for years.
Australia transports asylum seekers who arrive by boat to off-shore processing centres in Nauru and Papua New Guinea's Manus Island.
Even if found to be genuine refugees, they are already blocked from being resettled in Australia.
They can either return home, be resettled on Manus or Nauru, or go to a third country.
Australia sent five Chinese men home in 2017 after authorities intercepted an alleged people-smuggling boat in the Torres Strait south of Papua New Guinea.
The country mooted plans in 2016 to bar any asylum seekers who try to reach the country by boat from ever being able to enter."
http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-australia-43818582,asylum seeker,365,19 April 2018,None,Philippines' Duterte says he ordered probe into Australian nun,"Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte has said he personally authorised an investigation into an Australian nun who was detained earlier this week.
Sister Patricia Fox, 71, was held by immigration authorities in Manila on Monday after being accused of political activity that breached her visa.
She was released on Tuesday without charge, and has denied any wrongdoing.
Mr Duterte accused her of ""disorderly conduct"", warning that foreign critics of his government faced being deported.
""You insult me under the cloak of being a Catholic priest, and you are a foreigner. Who are you? It is a violation of sovereignty,"" he said at an armed forces ceremony in Manila.
""The Philippine laws provide that I can deport you, or refuse you entry, if you are an undesirable alien.""
Sister Fox is a long-term resident of the Philippines and the mother superior of a local Catholic order.
Her temporary detention sparked protests from supporters in the largely Catholic country.
Authorities accused Sister Fox of participating in partisan rallies in Mindanao, a restive island in the country's south that is under martial law.
However, Sister Fox denied that her activism was political.
""I have been joining pro-human rights rallies for the farmers - for their land rights - [and] to release political prisoners,"" she said.
""I would call it part of our duty as a religious [group] that we support the poor.""
In his speech, Mr Duterte suggested that Sister Fox should instead scrutinise Australia.
""You nun, why don't you criticise your own government, the way you handle the refugees, hungry and dying and you turn them back to the open sea?""
""You do not have that right to criticise us. Do not insult my country. We never did that to Australia. We never did that to (a) European country.""
Under a controversial policy, Australia turns back asylum seeker boats at sea when it deems such action is safe. Canberra has also drawn criticism for detaining asylum seekers in overseas centres.
The government has defended both policies as part of a deterrence strategy that it argues saves lives at sea.
Australia has previously criticised Mr Duterte for his government's war on drugs, which has caused the deaths of thousands."
https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-44660699,asylum seeker,960,11 September 2018,None,Migration to Europe in charts,"Migration has once again become one of the most important issues in Europe.
Italy's decision in June not to accept the rescue vessel Aquarius with more than 600 migrants on board attracted widespread criticism, and the issue of border controls for migrants threatened to break up the German coalition government.
So, how many people are arriving now, where are they from and what is happening to those who have arrived in the EU in previous years?
The highest number of arrivals - 1,015,078 - was recorded in 2015. More than 800,000 of them were trafficked by sea from Turkey to Greece, and the majority of them continued to travel through Europe to reach Germany and Sweden.
Since 2015, the number of refugees and migrants arriving in Greece has fallen dramatically, after the EU and Turkey signed an agreement to send back to Turkey migrants who do not apply for asylum or whose claim was rejected.
While the number of arrivals has dropped in Greece, the number of people arriving in Italy showed little change until 2018 when it also dropped considerably. In 2016 and 2017, 180,000 and 119,000 arrived in Italy respectively, smuggled by traffickers from North Africa and rescued at sea. In 2017, Italy received 67% of the EU's migrant arrivals.
However, since January this year, the number of arrivals in Italy has greatly reduced, with 20,120 arriving by mid-September 2018.
In the same period, Spain received the highest number of migrants and refugees - almost 35,000 - the majority of them by sea and more than 5,300 by land to Ceuta and Melilla, two Spanish enclaves in North Africa.
The UN refugee agency (UNHCR) says that routes used by human traffickers are constantly changing and are dependent on a number of factors, but the drop in numbers reaching Italy is attributed mainly to its close co-operation with the Libyan coastguard.
A total of 20,760 have arrived in Greece so far this year, bringing the total number of arrivals in the EU in 2018 to just over 76,000
Syria is still the most common country of origin of those arriving in Greece. Arrivals from Iraq and Afghanistan are also among the top countries of origin.
In Italy and Spain, arrivals from mostly African countries top the list. In Italy, the most common country of origin is Tunisia, followed by Eritrea, Sudan, Nigeria, and Pakistan. Spain received most of its migrants from Guinea, followed by Morocco and Mali, as well as the Ivory Coast, Syria and a number of other Sub-Saharan African countries.
The highest estimated number of dead and missing migrants in the Mediterranean - 5,096 - was recorded in 2016, despite a significant drop in migrant crossings compared with the previous year. Since then the number of deaths has fallen.
The Mediterranean crossing is becoming deadlier every year, if the number of estimated deaths is viewed as a proportion of the number of people who actually manage to reach the EU.
In 2015, there was one death in every 269 arrivals recorded. In 2016, this went up to one death in 72 arrivals and in 2017 to one in 57 arrivals.
But based on figures to mid-September 2018, the deadliest year so far has been this year, with one death for every 49 people who arrived in the EU.
That's because in 2014 and 2015 the majority of refugees and migrants arriving in the EU entered Greece from Turkey, using a much shorter sea route, while since 2016, that has been replaced by a much longer and more dangerous route - to Italy from Libya.
The top countries by origin of asylum seekers in the EU since 2014 are Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, Nigeria and Pakistan, all countries with recent or ongoing conflicts.
Between 2014 and 2017, a total of more than 919,000 Syrians applied for asylum in the EU.
Asylum seekers from Eritrea, Bangladesh, Somalia, Iran and a number of Sub-Saharan countries are among the top 10 countries of origin of those who have been applying for asylum in the EU since 2014.
Sharing the burden of asylum applications equally between the EU countries is once again the top issue on the EU agenda. The June EU summit, where the leaders agreed that member states should distribute asylum seekers among themselves, has not solved the issue because the redistribution will be only on a voluntary basis.
The number of first-time asylum applications reached a record level in 2016 and has fallen since.
Each asylum application is assessed on an individual basis. The process can take many years, and those who apply for asylum are given basic housing, food, education and healthcare.
At the end of the process, asylum is granted to those who can prove they fled war and persecution, while those who do not meet the criteria are refused asylum.
The top country for successful asylum applications is Germany, followed by France, Italy, Austria and Sweden.
The governments of the EU countries have warned that those who do not have a legitimate asylum claim will be returned to their country of origin.
The European Commission estimated that there were more than two million people staying in the EU illegally in 2015. Hundreds of thousands of those who do not qualify for asylum have been returned since then, but there are still hundreds of thousands of undocumented migrants living in the EU.
The European Commission says it does not want its migration policy to be judged on how many returns there have been and that its aim is that everyone who qualifies for asylum gets it, with people who are not eligible not coming in the first place.
Correction 30 July: The chart on successful asylum applications has been amended to include the total number of first-instance decisions."
https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-45558510,asylum seeker,688,19 September 2018,By Bethany Bell,Salzburg summit: Austria leads EU's anti-migrant drive,"In the small Austrian border town of Spielfeld there are still vivid reminders of the 2015 European migrant crisis, when tens of thousands of people crossed on foot from Slovenia.
Metal barriers and huge tents were erected at the border, where refugees and migrants were sheltered and fed while their asylum claims were processed.
The Austrian government that has come to power in the wake of the crisis has made migration a priority of its European Union presidency.
This week, along with Brexit, migration is set to dominate the informal summit of European Union leaders that starts in Salzburg on Wednesday evening.
As political tensions on migrants run high in the EU, Austria has emerged as one of the hard-line voices.
The tents of Spielfeld lie empty today, and deserted containers are still equipped with computers and finger-printing machines.
They were last used on 6 March 2016, just after the Balkan route for refugees was closed, says Leo Josefus of Austrian police.
The border management camp is still here ""just in case"", he says.
""We need about 24 hours to get it working if the refugees come, but nobody knows.""
Some 90,000 people applied for asylum in Austria in 2015, about 1% of the country's population.
But while the number of asylum seekers has now dropped dramatically, migration remains key for an Austrian coalition made up of conservatives and the far right.
Taking a tough line on migration has helped conservative Chancellor Sebastian Kurz as much as his Freedom Party partners at the ballot box.
Mr Kurz has been at the forefront of calls to shift the focus, from relocating asylum seekers inside the EU to defending Europe's outer borders.
Peter Launsky-Tieffenthal, spokesman for the Austrian presidency, says they hope to see progress in Salzburg on the issue of strengthening Frontex, the European coast and border guard.
""Frontex's mandate should be strengthened, its ability to act on the ground and in the waters of the Mediterranean,"" he said. ""Its resources should be strengthened and its personnel should be increased.""
But while there may be movement on Frontex, other splits on migration are all too evident in the EU.
Last week at a conference in Vienna, Italy's far-right Interior Minister Matteo Salvini likened African immigrants to slaves - leading to a spat with Luxembourg's Foreign Minister, Jean Asselborn.
An hour's drive north of the border, in a sunny square in Graz, I met a man named Friedrich, who told me migration and integration would never work.
""It's good we have this new government. The left-wing government we had before was a catastrophe,"" he said.
""We are taking far too many people in, and they don't want to integrate. They want to live at the cost of the taxpayer.""
But critics of the government accuse it of deliberately stoking populist fears about migrants and refugees.
Opposition politician Peter Pilz says border controls such as those at Spielfeld ""are not about security, but about propaganda.""
Since it came to power last year, the government has moved to cut benefit payments to refugees and foreigners as well as to some of the institutions that support them.
In Graz, I visited Somm, an organisation that works to help women refugees and asylum seekers get to know and integrate into Austrian society. Among its activities, it offers German classes and provides translation help at the doctor's or in hospitals.
But its head, Khatera Sadr told me they have had to reduce their programmes because of a lack of funding.
""With the new government, we feel the cuts because fewer German classes are being offered for migrants who don't have asylum status,"" she said. ""We think this is a great shame because the first step towards integration is learning the language.""
One of her students, Saleha Yaghubi from Afghanistan, came to Austria in 2016 with her son. They applied for asylum and are waiting to hear if they will be granted the right to stay.
She is nervous.
""When I hear about the new government, I can't sleep at night,"" she told me. ""I wake up and pray that all these problems will go away."""
https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-australia-45244149,asylum seeker,395,20 August 2018,None,Human rights groups call for children to be taken off Nauru,"A group of human rights organisations has demanded the Australian government remove all child asylum seekers held on the Pacific island of Nauru.
It comes as reports of a 12-year-old boy on a weeks-long hunger strike fuelled fresh fears about their health.
The #KidsOffNauru coalition wants the 119 children on the island resettled by November.
Australia's controversial offshore detention policy has been criticised for its toll on asylum seekers.
The facility on Nauru was established under the country's hardline immigration policy, which sees asylum seekers who try to reach the country by boat processed at offshore centres.
The centre on Nauru has been dogged by allegations of widespread abuse and trauma among children and women.
The coalition of more than 30 charities and advocacy groups, including World Vision Australia and Oxfam Australia, wants all children moved to Australia or settled in a safe country elsewhere.
Chief executive of World Vision Australia Claire Rogers said the children on Nauru have ""no hope"".
""Many of them have lived for years in tents, they have been separated from close family members and have no safe place to play or access to acceptable medical care.""
""The clock is ticking. This harmful, secretive and dysfunctional system of indefinite detention must end,"" Ms Rogers said.
The Australian government did not respond to the BBC's requests for comment.
Allegations of human rights abuses and overcrowding have plagued Australia's detention centre in Nauru for years.
The mental toll on young people is drawing increasing focus and includes reports of suicide attempts.
The issue attracted fresh concern last week with news of the 12-year-old on hunger strike - a boy from Iran.
Ian Rintoul, spokesperson for the Refugee Action Coalition, said the child has now been on a hunger strike for around 19 days. Efforts were being made to transfer him to Australia for urgent medical care.
Access to Nauru is difficult - with foreign journalists hampered by the $8,000 Australian dollar ($5,850; £4,591) non-refundable charge per visa application.
Advocacy groups say families live squalid conditions, in mouldy tents with dirty bathroom facilities. Children have few places to play on the island.
The tiny nation in the Pacific is around 53km from the equator, and covered in phosphate rocks.
The facility currently holds more than 240 men, women and children, according to AFP news agency, and is an economic lifeline for the isolated nation."
http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-43683687,asylum seeker,414,7 April 2018,None,Two killed in Germany as van ploughs into crowd in Muenster,"Two people have been killed in the western German city of Muenster after a van drove into people sitting outside restaurants.
The driver of the vehicle, who has not yet been officially identified, died after shooting himself at the scene.
About 20 people were injured in the incident, six seriously, which occurred near the Kiepenkerl statue in the city's old town area.
Authorities have said there is no indication it is an Islamist attack.
State Interior Minister Herbet Reuel said investigators currently believe the perpetrator is a German citizen.
Mr Reuel also said that two people had been killed by the driver, revising an earlier police figure of three.
A vehicle, reportedly a grey VW van, was driven into a restaurant terrace area at 15:27 local time (14:27 BST) on Saturday.
Eyewitnesses said it was driven at speed and photographs of the aftermath showed tables and chairs strewn across the popular tourist square.
An employee at one of the cafes told local media that she heard a bang and people screaming.
""I'm angry - it's cowardly to do something like this,"" she told German television channel N24.
The suspect's motive and exact identity still remains unclear, but German media reported he was a national with mental health problems.
An apartment elsewhere in the city has been searched by investigators.
Daniel Kollenberg, who witnessed the aftermath, told the BBC: ""I think it is a deliberate attack because it's not allowed for cars to go in this area.""
He said, ""People are calm, but really shocked,"" adding that people were scared and disbelieving that such an attack could happen in Muenster.
The city, in Germany's north west, has a population of about 300,000.
Chancellor Angela Merkel said in a statement she was ""deeply shaken"" by the incident.
""Everything possible is now being done to clarify the facts and to support the victims and their relatives,"" she added.
The incident comes at a time of a heightened concern in Europe, following a spate of jihadist attacks using vehicles to kill pedestrians in the UK, France and Sweden.
Local police repeatedly urged people on Saturday afternoon not to speculate about the nature of the incident and wait for official information.
Germany has seen a number of jihadist attacks in recent years. In December 2016 a lorry was driven into a crowd at a Christmas market in the capital, Berlin.
The attacker who hijacked the vehicle, Tunisian asylum seeker Anis Amri, was shot dead in Italy four days later."

Herbert Kickl from the Austrian Freedom Party (FPÖ) rejected accusations he chose the expression as a provocation.
Vienna's deputy mayor said Mr Kickl had gone too far.
Maria Vassilakou said the language of Nazism could not be allowed to creep into people's lives.
Mr Kickl said he wanted ""services centres and infrastructure that would allow the authorities to concentrate asylum seekers in one place"".
He has promised to implement a very strict asylum policy.
Steffi Krisper of the liberal Neos party said it looked ""like a deliberate provocation which is subsequently denied in a half-hearted fashion"".
When questioned on his choice of words, Mr Kickl said a ""semantic discussion"" was not needed and he had not meant to provoke.
The government of Prime Minister Sebastian Kurz says the current system, which sees aid groups provide most asylum seeker accommodation, is inefficient.
Austria is run by a coalition government formed by Mr Kurz's conservative People's Party and the far-right Freedom Party.
The deal made Austria the only Western European state with a governing far-right party, opposed to migration and the European Union.
It follows an election in October that failed to yield a concrete result.
The FPÖ has distanced itself from its founders' Nazi past but has had to expel several officials in recent years over Nazi-related allegations."
http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-39196105,asylum seeker,527,7 March 2017,None,Hungary to detain all asylum seekers in border camps,"Hungary's parliament has approved the automatic detention of all asylum seekers in container camps at the country's borders, prompting ""deep concern"" from the UN Refugee Agency.
The legislation was approved by a large majority of lawmakers.
Prime Minister Viktor Orban said it was a response to recent terror attacks in Europe carried out by migrants.
Speaking at a swearing-in ceremony for 450 new border police, he said Hungary was ""under siege"".
""The migration flow has only slowed, but it is not over,"" Mr Orban said. ""We have gained time to strengthen our lines of defence.""
He called immigration ""the Trojan horse of terrorism"", adding: ""If the world sees that we can defend our borders... then no one will try to come to Hungary illegally"".
The prime minister said the arrival of Muslim migrants endangers Europe's Christian culture and identity.
""Those readying for the journey do not want to live according to our ways and culture, but according to their own - only with a European quality of life,"" he said in Budapest.
Under the new measures, all asylum seekers entering Hungary - and those currently in the country - will be confined in camps built from shipping containers while their asylum applications are processed.
Appeals against rejected applications will be fast-tracked, and those denied entry may have to cover their own detention costs.
Human rights groups including Amnesty International have raised grave concerns about the crackdown, calling it ""xenophobic, fear-mongering propaganda"".
""There are hardly 400 asylum seekers in the country,"" said a statement issued by seven groups, including Amnesty International Hungary, the Hungarian Helsinki Committee, and MigSzol, the Migrant Solidarity Group of Hungary.
Gauri Van Gulik, Amnesty International's Deputy Director for Europe, said the move was ""beyond the pale"".
""These measures will even be applied to children, a flagrant violation of international and European law,"" she said.
""Dumping all refugees and migrants into containers isn't a refugee policy - it's avoiding one.""
The UN Refugee Agency said it was ""deeply concerned"" about the detention of asylum seekers.
""This new law ... will have a terrible physical and psychological impact on women, children and men who have already greatly suffered,"" it said in a statement.
Hungary's nationalist prime minister has maintained a hardline stance on migration for some years.
In 2015, when the country became a transit state for asylum seekers en route to Germany and other EU nations, he responded by building razor wire fences on the borders with Serbia and Croatia.
Some 400,000 migrants passed through Hungary that year before the fences were in place.
A second, 150km (93 mile) fence on the Serbian border is scheduled for completion in May, equipped with night cameras and heat and movement sensors.
In October last year, Hungary held a referendum on whether to accept mandatory EU quotas for relocating migrants.
The EU had asked it to accept 1,294 refugees.
The referendum was ultimately invalid, as while 98% of those who took part wanted to reject the EU plan, the turnout fell short of the required 50% threshold.
In 2016, Hungary registered 29,432 asylum claims and accepted just 425 asylum seekers.
By contrast, Germany took in 280,000 in 2016."

http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-39105929,asylum seeker,792,3 March 2017,By Ewan Murrie,More asylum seekers are being 'left destitute' in Scotland,"Hundreds more migrants are being left destitute in Scotland, according to the British Red Cross (BRC).
The charity said the number of destitute refugees and asylum seekers it had helped in Glasgow had increased from 326 in 2014 to 820 in 2016.
It accused the UK government of making the asylum process ""increasingly difficult"" - a claim the Home Office has disputed.
The Scottish government said the situation was ""unacceptable"".
According to the charity, the new figures to ""some extent"" reflected an overall increase in the number of people claiming protection in Scotland, including asylum seekers from Syria.
But it claimed changes made in 2014 to the support and advice offered by the Home Office had also increased destitution among migrants.
A BRC spokeswoman said: ""There's been a change to a telephone model of providing [asylum support] advice, which has made it more difficult for those with language barriers to access support.""
She added that she believed the Home Office was requiring ""more and more"" information from asylum applicants, while also withdrawing advocacy from the service specification.
Asked how destitution had been defined, the BRC said it considered clients to be destitute if they did not eat sufficiently, had no fixed home, could not afford essential items and/or were experiencing worsening health.
In April 2014, government-funded advice for asylum seekers living in Scotland began being delivered by Migrant Help, a charity based in the south east of England.
Previously, this contract was held by the Scottish Refugee Council (SRC), based in Glasgow.
The Home Office disputed any suggestions that Migrant Help did not offer the same level of face-to-face support as SRC, adding that Migrant Help had a ""well-established presence"" in Scotland.
The figures prompted the Scottish government to accuse the UK government of delivering a ""consistent reduction"" in the support it offered to asylum seekers.
Last year, the SRC called for an inquiry into the treatment of asylum seekers in Glasgow.
Noreen, a single mum in Glasgow, was destitute and an asylum seeker during her pregnancy
After fleeing persecution in her homeland, Noreen's claim for asylum in the UK was initially refused.
Alone and with no right to work or receive government support, she told BBC Scotland enduring her pregnancy was ""a living nightmare"".
""I was so down that when I was seven months pregnant I told the doctor I didn't want the baby - but it was already too late.""
""I was crying saying, 'I am so hungry, I don't even have any food',"" she said.
Noreen said she did not receive government support until she was nine months pregnant.
Until then, she was forced to rely on charities and friends to survive.
But Noreen revealed that before her pregnancy, the asylum process had already driven her into a severe depression.
""I was admitted to hospital twice, after trying to cut my veins,"" she told BBC Scotland.
""I didn't want to live - there was no hope for me,"" she added.
Today, Noreen has been granted refugee status and lives with her two children in Glasgow.
Names have been changed.
What can the Scottish government do?
While immigration and asylum policy is reserved to the UK government, the Scottish government can provide support to asylum seekers under devolved functions, such as education, social care and health.
The Scottish Parliament's Equalities and Human Rights Committee (EHRC) has launched an inquiry into destitution amongst asylum seekers - which will publish its findings and recommendations in April.
Equalities Secretary Angela Constance said she hoped the inquiry would ""shine a light"" on the issue of destitution and asylum in Scotland.
The Scottish Refugee Council said it hoped the EHRC inquiry would lead to ""concrete actions to support people bearing the brunt of the UK government's hostile environment policy for immigrants"".
A Home Office spokesman said: ""The UK has a proud history of granting asylum to those who need our protection and those seeking refuge have access to a range of advice and support in the UK.
""Migrant Help offers asylum seekers access to online literature and both telephone and face-to-face advice.
""Outreach sessions are held around the UK, including in Scotland where [Migrant Help] have a well-established presence.
""It is only right that the service refers asylum seekers looking for legal advice to qualified solicitors who are cleared to handle immigration matters.
""Those who do not need our help should leave the country rather than being supported by UK taxpayers.""
Migrant Help said: ""In Scotland, Migrant Help offers face-to-face advice to asylum seekers accommodated in the initial accommodation, but also to those in dispersal accommodation who are deemed vulnerable.
""All asylum seekers across the UK can access our free telephone helpline which offers independent advice tailored to the region where the caller is based."""

Vinod Moorjani, 45, is accused of saying ""bomb hai"" [there is a bomb] during a call with the authorities at Mumbai International Airport on Sunday.
But he says he was asking about the status of his ""Bom-Del"" flight. Mumbai was formerly known as Bombay.
Officials say Mr Moorjani made the call after becoming frustrated with delays.
Police believe he intended to disrupt outgoing flights so he would not miss his connection in Rome, the Press Trust of India reports.
An official told the news agency that he was travelling from Mumbai to Virginia with his wife and children.
""Before the operator could hear more from Moorjani, he hung up the call, after which the operator alerted her seniors, who informed the police"", the official added.
But Mr Moorjani, a businessman and CEO of a US company, says he hung up because of a disturbance on the phone line.
He has appeared in court charged with criminal intimidation and other offences."
