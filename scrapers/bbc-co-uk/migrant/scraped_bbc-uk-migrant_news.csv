https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-46082886,migrant,455,3 November 2018,None,Migrant caravan: Mexico bus transportation offer withdrawn,"Thousands of migrants from Central America heading for the US-Mexico border have had an offer of free bus transport to Mexico City withdrawn.
The governor of the Mexican state of Veracruz, Miguel Angel Yunes, said on Friday buses would be provided to carry migrants to the nation's capital.
However, Mr Yunes cancelled the offer just hours later, blaming a water shortage in the city for his decision.
The caravan, now some 5,000 people, set off from Honduras several weeks ago.
They say they are fleeing persecution, poverty and violence in their home countries of Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador.
In a video posted to Twitter on Friday, Mr Yunes said that a ""serious shortage of water"" in Mexico City over the weekend meant that it would be wrong to transport the migrants there.
""The shortage will affect more than seven million people,"" he said, adding that his initial offer of supplying buses would have made the situation worse.
""I would like to ask the migrants, while the problems get solved and we wait for an in-depth solution to this issue, that they accept an invitation to go to a city of Veracruz further to the south, to a bigger city where they will have adequate installations to provide them with safety.""
Responding to Mr Yunes in an open letter, the migrants said the governor's decision to withdraw his offer to help transport people hundreds of kilometres was unacceptable.
""We consider that the argument of the shortage of water is not a valid one,"" they wrote, urging Mr Yunes to ""fulfil his offer"".
""The people in the caravan have walked for weeks under the rain and sun from Central America, where they left their houses and families; they were forced to leave their countries due to the violence, death and hunger,"" the letter reads.
""The hard conditions, the lack of proper shelter and proper food has impacted on the health of the people,"" it adds.
Earlier this week, US President Donald Trump said more than 5,200 troops will be deployed to the US-Mexico border to stop the migrant caravan.
The mid-term elections are now just days away and critics have said that Mr Trump has used the threat of illegal immigration to fire up his supporters.
At a campaign rally in Miami on Friday, former President Barack Obama accused Mr Trump of cynical politics and a political stunt over his plans to send troops to the Mexican border.
The migrant caravan set off on 12 October with a plan to trek for more than a month.
Most previous migrant caravans have numbered a few hundred people, but after a former politician posted about the plan on Facebook, news of it quickly spread and the numbers swelled."
https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-45951782,migrant,926,30 October 2018,None,Migrant caravan: What is it and why does it matter?,"Thousands of migrants from Central America are trudging north towards the US-Mexico border.
They say they are fleeing persecution, poverty and violence in their home countries of Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador.
The journey poses a host of dangers, such as dehydration and criminal gangs, but many of the migrants say they feel safer travelling in numbers.
Here's what you need to know about the convoy of people known as the migrant caravan.
On 12 October, in the crime-ridden Honduran city of San Pedro Sula, a group of 160 people gathered at a bus terminal and prepared to set off on the dangerous journey.
They had been planning the trek for more than a month, in an attempt to escape unemployment and the threat of violence in their home country.
Most previous migrant caravans have numbered a few hundred people, but after a former politician posted about the plan on Facebook, news of it quickly spread and the numbers swelled.
By the time the group set off in the early hours of 13 October, more than 1,000 Hondurans had joined.
They have since crossed into neighbouring Guatemala and then Mexico, with thousands more people joining along the way.
Most of the migrants say they are seeking a new life and better opportunities in the US or Mexico.
Others say they are fleeing violence in their home country and intend to apply for asylum.
Honduras, which has a population of about nine million, has endemic problems with gang violence, drug wars and corruption. The wider region has one of the highest murder rates in the world.
""It's our dream to reach the United States, we want to give our children a better future and here [in Honduras] we can't find work,"" one mother of two told local newspaper El Heraldo.
While Central Americans have long fled their homelands for the US and have sometimes joined forces along the way, the organised nature of this caravan is relatively new.
Migrants are often kidnapped by people traffickers and drugs gangs who force them to work for them. A large group such as this one is harder to target and therefore offers more protection.
It is hard to say exactly, but the caravan has grown rapidly in size as it has moved north.
A spokesman for the United Nations said more than 7,000 people had joined the group as of 22 October, citing estimates from the International Organisation for Migration.
But some migrants have turned back or been offered asylum in Mexico, meaning that number has decreased.
On 30 October, a US border official said the caravan was moving through southern Mexico and consisted of approximately 3,500 people.
Separately, the official said a second group of 3,000 mainly Honduran migrants was at the Guatemala-Mexico border.
The journey is gruelling and poses a number of challenges for those who decide to join the caravan.
The hot weather means sunburn and dehydration are a constant risk, and some of the migrants have attempted to protect themselves with umbrellas and pieces of cardboard.
A number of people have fainted during the journey after walking for six consecutive days.
The migrants have been sleeping on the streets or in makeshift camps and there is a lack of clean water and sanitation.
Food is also in short supply, and local people have reportedly been providing the convoy with some food as it passes through.
At the border between Guatemala and Mexico, where migrants faced long waits as border officials checked their documents, there were clashes with police as tempers flared.
Some migrants threw stones and the police fired tear gas, leaving several people injured.
There is a legal obligation to hear asylum claims from migrants who have arrived in the US if they say they fear violence in their home countries.
Those seeking asylum must be fleeing due to a serious fear of persecution. Under international law, these are considered refugees.
If an asylum seeker enters the US illegally, they are still entitled to a hearing of their claim.
But those seeking a better quality of life - even if they are fleeing devastating poverty - are not considered refugees and do not have the same protections.
US Attorney General Jeff Sessions says the ""credible fear"" asylum rule has been exploited in the past, and announced in June that victims of domestic abuse and gang violence would no longer generally qualify under it.
This ""Turn-back Policy"" is currently subject to a lawsuit from the Southern Poverty Law Center, which accuses immigration officials of unlawfully delaying access to the asylum process.
Unlike previous smaller convoys of migrants, this one has drawn the attention of US President Donald Trump.
He has criticised a number of Central American countries for allowing people to leave the region and come ""illegally"" to the US.
Mr Trump has also threatened to cut off foreign aid to these countries, but he has not specified what money will be cut and it is unclear how he would do so.
Curbing illegal immigration was one of the main campaign promises Mr Trump made when he ran for president.
His Republican Party is facing mid-term elections on 6 November and could be unseated by Democrats in the House of Representatives.
Mr Trump has said the ""invasion"" of migrants would find the US military waiting for them and, on 29 October, it was announced that the US would send 5,200 troops to the border with Mexico.
The president also told Fox News that ""tent cities"" would be built to house migrants seeking asylum in the US."
https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/blogs-trending-45951102,migrant,804,24 October 2018,By Chris Bell,None,"A row raging over the migrant caravan travelling towards the United States is being fuelled by misinformation and false statements online.
Thousands of migrants have got as far as Mexico, after the caravan which set out from Honduras has travelled north and grown in size.
The caravan's progress towards the US southern border has become the subject of intense speculation and discussion on social media.
A number of false or misleading assertions are among those to be shared widely.
On @FoxNews this morning. Really? “Report: 100 ISIS terrorists caught in Guatemala” with the immigrant caravan? Report from who? pic.twitter.com/VPHG6auCoI

On Monday, President Trump asserted that ""unknown Middle Easterners"" were ""mixed in"" with the caravan heading north. However, on Tuesday he acknowledged there was no proof of those claims.
""There's no proof of anything. But there could very well be,"" the president said.
His initial assertion came shortly after Fox and Friends host Pete Hegseth reported claims that Guatemalan President Jimmy Morales had told a local newspaper they had caught more than 100 Islamic State group fighters in the country.
Reporters on the ground, including BBC correspondent Aleem Maqbool, have not seen ""unknown Middle Easterners"" among the migrants heading north.
We have been here embedded with the migrants. Have not seen or heard about a single Middle Easterner. I spent seven+ years in the Middle East, and speak a little Arabic, would likely pick up on it... #Migrant #caravan #MiddleEast https://t.co/49BM8DfPtm

I asked @JeffFlake if he knew what Trump was referring to with warning of “unknown Middle Easterners” in caravan: “No. That’s long been a canard and a fear tactic.”

BREAKING: Footage in Honduras giving cash 2 women & children 2 join the caravan & storm the US border @ election time. Soros? US-backed NGOs? Time to investigate the source! pic.twitter.com/5pEByiGkkN
End of Twitter post by @RepMattGaetz
Last week, Republican congressman Matt Gaetz tweeted a video he said showed Hondurans being paid to join the migrant caravan.
Billionaire philanthropist George Soros, who is something of a pantomime villain in the eyes of many on the right, might be behind the payments, Gaetz suggested.
President Trump was among those to share the footage, which has been viewed millions of times, while the claims that migrants have been in some way funded by Soros or the Democrats have continued to be repeated on social media.
I've called @CampbellSoupCo PR & @johnston_kelly asking for evidence of this claim, & also whether it reflects Campbell's corporate position. I will update if I hear back. Johnston is currently registered to lobby for Campbell on trade & agriculture issues https://t.co/W2ppfkBJJm
End of Twitter post by @kenvogel
On Monday, vice president of government affairs at Campbell Soup, Kelly Johnston, claimed Mr Soros' philanthropic organisation Open Society ""planned and is executing this"".
There does not appear to be any evidence of this and none appears to have been offered. A company spokesperson said: ""The opinions Mr Johnston expresses on Twitter are his individual views and do not represent the position of Campbell Soup Company"". Mr Johnston later deleted his Twitter account.
Open Society denies any involvement and the video shared by Gaetz and the president was actually filmed in Guatemala, a fact which Gaetz later acknowledged he had got wrong.
Guatemalan journalist Luis Assardo posted details on Twitter about his efforts to investigate the claims.
Assardo said he had spoken to locals who told him money, food and clothing were being handed out by local retailers to those in the caravan, up to a maximum of about $25 (£19) each.

Earlier this month President Trump, without evidence, accused Mr Soros of paying women protesting against the appointment of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.
On Monday, New York police said they had safely destroyed a suspected letter bomb sent to Mr Soros's home.
It's an eye-grabbing image: a bloodied Mexican federal police agent is helped by a colleague bearing a riot shield.
Prominent pro-Trump Facebook pages are among those to have shared it with their followers, alongside the claim it shows an officer ""brutalised by members of the caravan as they attempt to force their way into Mexico"".
Virginia Thomas, who is married to Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, also posted the images.
""The media won't share this, will they?"" she wrote.
But the image does not come from the migrant caravan story. Photojournalist Gustavo Aguado took the picture in October 2012 during clashes between police and students at a Mexican high school."
https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-45944166,migrant,709,24 October 2018,None,Migrant caravan in pictures: A river of people moving north,"Thousands of migrants from Central America are crossing Mexico from south to north in the hope of reaching the United States.
Many of them are parents with young children seeking a better life away from the violence and lack of opportunities in their home countries.
The size of the group has steadily grown from about 1,000 to more than 7,000, according to a United Nations estimate.
Observers have described it as ""a river of people"". Photojournalist Encarni Pindado documented their progress north across the Guatemala-Mexico border.
The group left the crime-ridden city of San Pedro Sula in Honduras on 13 October. From there, the migrants walked to Nueva Ocotepeque from where they crossed into Guatemala.
Their aim is to reach the United States where they say they want to start a new life away from the criminal gangs which control parts of Honduras.
But US President Donald Trump, who campaigned on a promise to curb illegal immigration to the US, said he would not let the caravan cross into the US.
He seized on the caravan as an opportunity to rally people to vote for his Republican Party in the forthcoming midterm elections on 6 November.
""Every time you see a Caravan, or people illegally coming, or attempting to come, into our Country illegally, think of and blame the Democrats for not giving us the votes to change our pathetic Immigration laws!"" he wrote.
In another tweet, Mr Trump claimed that ""criminals and unknown Middle Easterners are mixed in"" the migrant group - without giving any evidence of either.
One of the migrants held up a sign reading: ""Emigrating is not a crime, let's be free without borders"".
They walked across Guatemala and arrived at the Mexican border last week. Thousands of them headed for the bridge dividing the two countries.
Most of them are from Honduras and some had tied Honduran flags to their backpacks as they got ready to cross into Mexico.
Hundreds of Mexican federal police officers and soldiers were waiting for them on the other side.
The Mexican authorities had previously said that they would stop those who did not have passports or the correct visas.
Border officials started by checking the migrants' documents one at a time, which meant that by the end of the day only 300 people had been allowed to enter and 5,000 more were still waiting at the bridge.
Some of the migrants fainted on the crowded border bridge due to the heat and exhaustion after having walked for six days in a row.
With those on the Guatemalan side of the bridge growing increasingly frustrated at the wait, tempers flared and the two sides clashed, with some migrants throwing stones and police firing tear gas.
Several people were injured and a number of children were separated from their parents in the ensuing melee.
This father managed to hold on to his son and carried him in his arms after both had breathed in tear gas.
After 36 hours at the border, only 600 people had made it into Mexico via the official checkpoint.
Tired of waiting and increasingly worried they might get turned back by Mexican immigration officials, some migrants lowered themselves from the bridge into the river by ropes while others jumped.
Some were picked up by fellow migrants on makeshift rafts while others swam across the Suchiate river, which marks the border between Guatemala and Mexico.
The relief of those who made it into Mexico was great. They gathered in the main square of Ciudad Hidalgo, the city on the Mexican side of the border, and some danced as local musicians played.
Locals have been helping the migrants. Some have dropped off food and clothes at the squares where they have been sleeping and others have given the most vulnerable ones lifts north in their cars to make the journey a little easier.
However, catching lifts in overcrowded lorries and SUV can be dangerous. Two Hondurans died falling off the vehicles they had boarded, one in Guatemala and one in Mexico, officials said
The migrants have been sleeping wherever they can as they move further north. Their journey to the US-Mexican border is expected to take them weeks.

Mr Trump criticised the countries on Monday for allowing people to leave the region and come ""illegally"" to the US.
The group is travelling through Mexico, but is still far from the US border.
Human rights organisations have said that cutting aid would make the situation worse.
The president has not specified what money will be cut and it is unclear if such action can be taken by presidential order.
Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador were not able to do the job of stopping people from leaving their country and coming illegally to the U.S. We will now begin cutting off, or substantially reducing, the massive foreign aid routinely given to them.
End of Twitter post by @realDonaldTrump
In 2017, Guatemala received over $248m (£191m) in US aid. The same year, Honduras received $175m and El Salvador $115m, according to the US Agency for International Development.
""Cutting aid to refugee-producing countries will only make worse the conditions that displace people in the first place,"" said Human Rights Watch on Sunday.
The organisation said root causes must be addressed. ""People generally don't want to leave their homes if they can live normal, safe lives there.""
Though President Trump has accused the migrants of trying to illegally enter the US, many of the families travelling towards the border are seeking asylum.
They say they are fleeing persecution, poverty and violence in their home countries.
By the BBC's Aleem Maqbool in Mexico
The square in Tapachula - the first major population centre inside Mexico for these migrants - has turned into what looked like a makeshift camp. Along one side, ambulances lined up so medics could treat those who had become sick or got injured on their journey.
Mexicans came to offer food, water and clothes to the many hundreds of Hondurans who rested ahead of the long punishing journey that still remains ahead of them to the US border.
Many women among the group in particular have told us that they could never have made this journey alone, because it would have been too dangerous. So in spite of their tiredness, they are glad to be with others.
But there is a sense that this is no longer just a convoy of those here in Tapachula, but that there is now a long stream of people stretching back along the route through Guatemala to Honduras, with people stuck at various obstacles and others who are still coming to join this migration.
Curbing illegal immigration was one of the main campaign promises Mr Trump made when he ran for president.
His Republican Party is facing mid-term elections on 6 November and could be unseated by Democrats in the House of Representatives.
Without offering evidence, Mr Trump has repeatedly suggested the caravan was politically motivated.
On Monday he urged people to blame Democrats for the border crisis, saying: ""Remember the mid-terms"".
He also tweeted that the caravan contained ""criminals and unknown Middle Easterners"". When he was later pressed by journalists on what this meant, he offered no origin for the claim but invited reporters to investigate for themselves.
On Sunday, the migrant caravan reached the town of Tapachula, approximately 37km (23 miles) from Mexico's southern border with Guatemala.
The Mexican authorities had earlier tried to stop them at a border bridge, but some managed to cross into Mexico illegally by boat over the Suchiate river.
""We have sunburn. We have blisters. But we got here. Our strength is greater than Trump's threats,"" migrant Britany Hernández told AFP news agency.
It is expected to take weeks before the caravan reaches the US-Mexico border, according to US media.
One of the closest border crossings in Brownsville, Texas is still over 1,000 miles (1,600 km) away from Tapachula.
The last leg of their journey will also have to wait until Mexico processes the group, and asylum claims can take up to 45 days.
A group of about 1,000 Hondurans set off on foot from a bus terminal in the crime-ridden city of San Pedro Sula on 13 October in an attempt to escape unemployment and the threat of violence.
Many of them had become aware of the caravan after a former lawmaker had published a poster announcing the caravan on Facebook. News of it quickly spread on social media.
They have since been joined by other Central American nationals as they crossed Guatemala towards the Mexican border.
The region has one of the highest murder rates in the world and many try to flee gang violence.
The exact number is hard to determine as the group has split up. Some are already in the Mexican city of Tapachula, while others are still at the Guatemala-Mexico border.
Some estimates put the number of migrants who left Ciudad Hidalgo for Tapachula on Sunday at 5,000 while a Mexican federal police commander gave a lower number of 3,000. Another 1,500 migrants are estimated to be waiting to cross at the Guatemalan side of the border.
A newly formed group of 1,000 mainly Honduran migrants has set off for the US, as well.
However, 3,400 Hondurans have also turned back, according to official figures.
Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernández urged citizens not to join the caravan. His country has also sent buses to the Mexico-Guatemala border to repatriate those who may have changed their minds about heading to the US or who are simply too exhausted to carry on.
Mexico said it would stop those who did not have passports or the correct visas at its southern border. But faced with thousands of migrants and after initial clashes, riot police got back on the buses that had brought them to the border bridge.
About 900 migrants crossed the river and made it into Mexico, without the police intervening.
On Monday, incoming Mexican Secretary of Foreign Affairs Marcelo Ebrard - who will take up the post on 1 December - told reporters that Mr Trump's tweets were linked with domestic politics.
""The tweets we've been seeing lately do not surprise me, they do not surprise the government,"" he said via an interpreter, according to Reuters news agency.
""It's very close to the mid-term elections in the United States,"" Mr Ebrard said after meeting with Canada's foreign minister in Ottawa.
Mr Ebrard did not answer when asked directly about how Mexico will treat the caravan, but said that his country planned changes to its immigration policy.
""There are going to be many more work visas. We are going to invest in Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador,"" he said.
Mexican officials say they have been encouraging the migrants to apply for asylum and that more than 1,000 have started the process. Those whose claims are rejected by Mexican officials will be deported.
Those who managed to cross into Mexico expressed their joy at having it made that far. Many shouted ""Yes, we could!"" and ""we won't stop"".
""We're exhausted, it's been a terribly difficult journey but we have hope: we've made it to Mexico, which means a lot to us,"" a migrant called José Luis told BBC Mundo.
A woman called María, who is taking part in the caravan with her husband and her two small children, told BBC Mundo's Ana Gabriela Rojas: ""We are very happy to be here and we ask Mexican authorities and people to let us pass through. We are just looking for a job and better living conditions."""
