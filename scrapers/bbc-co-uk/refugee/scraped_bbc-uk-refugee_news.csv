https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-highlands-islands-45941264,refugee,22 October 2018,None,Refugee film shooting in North and South Uist,"A feature film about refugees waiting to be granted asylum on a fictional remote Scottish island is being made in the Western Isles.
Limbo involves a five-week shoot at locations in North and South Uist.
Real-life refugees who have been resettled in communities across Scotland will appear as extras.
The cast is led by Amir El-Masry, who has previously appeared in Jack Ryan, The State, The Night Manager. He plays the character Omar in Limbo.
Other cast members include Vikash Bhai, Ola Orebiyi and Kwabena Ansah.
Sidse Babett Knudsen, who has appeared in Duke of Burgundy and Borgen, and Kais Nashif, who won an award at this year's Venice Film Festival, have supporting roles.
Directed by award-winning film-maker Ben Sharrock, it is being financed by Film4, Screen Scotland and the BFI. 
Limbo's plot focuses on Omar, a young Syrian musician who is burdened by the weight of his grandfather's oud, a traditional stringed instrument, which he has carried all the way from his homeland. 
The Western Isles is among places in Scotland where families fleeing conflict in Syria have been resettle under an initiative supported by Cosla and the Scottish government.

Yr Ysgwrn, near Trawsfynydd, Gwynedd, was home to Ellis Humphrey Evans, aka Hedd Wyn, in the early 20th Century. 
The farmstead, which celebrates his life and achievements, has been named the best building conservation project in the UK.
The award was given by the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors. 
The £3m project, which was completed in May 2017, saw the farmhouse renovated along with the black chair awarded at the National Eisteddfod a few weeks after the bard's death in July 1917, which was originally carved by a Belgian World War One refugee called Eugeen Vanfleteren. 
An exhibition and visitors' centre was also built to mark the impact of the war on the community.
Wyn was killed on the first day of the Battle of Passchendaele in Belgium.
Judges said of the scheme: ""The conservation of this humble dwelling in such a remote area with its view across Snowdonia provides a much more powerful understanding of its significance in cultural and literary contexts as well as the historical juxtaposition with the horrors of the Great War that might otherwise have been lost.""
The house was one of 12 regional winners in the conservation category, which also included Canterbury Cathedral, Delapre Abbey in Northampton and Belfast's Tropical Ravine.

Garff MHK Daphne Caine had asked Chief Minister Howard Quayle to reconsider the island's position.
Mr Quayle responded by saying the island had ""no plans to accept Syrian Refugees"".
However, he said it would continue to support refugees through the provision of humanitarian aid.
In his written response, Mr Quayle revealed the island had pledged £1.5m to ""life-saving humanitarian aid"" since the conflict began.
Mrs Caine said it was ""heartening"" to know the island had helped thousands of refugees, but that she was ""disappointed"" it would not accept any as residents.
Since committing to help those displaced by the Syria conflict in 2014, the UK's Syrian Vulnerable Persons Resettlement Scheme has resettled over 11,000 refugees.
In February 2017, a petition signed by more than 1,000 people called for the Isle of Man to take its ""fair share"" and help up to 25 refugees.
Mrs Caine said the Isle of Man was a ""really wealthy place in world terms."" 
She said: ""I appreciate there are people here struggling and I care about the island's social issues, but the island needs to step up.
""There is a lot of support for the island to help, like other communities in Cumbria, the Scottish islands and Northern Ireland.""
Mr Quayle said the Isle of Man remained ""committed to continuing to play its part in the international response"".
But he said: ""The island does not have the legal authority or mechanisms to unilaterally accept refugees."" 
The Chief Minister said the Council of Ministers still felt the island was ""not in a position to offer the specialist support required"" in line with the views of the previous administration.
""We will continue to look for ways to support Syrian, and other refugees in the future through the provision of humanitarian aid.""

In 2017, Chief Minister Howard Quayle refused a call to take refugees and said the government could ""offer more effective support"" by providing funds to help the UN mission in the country.
Garff MHK Daphne Caine will table a Tynwald question later, asking for that decision to be reconsidered.
She will also ask how much support had been given to charities in Syria.
Mrs Caine told the Local Democracy Reporter Service that the island needed to ""step up on the world stage and do its part"".
She said the island had a ""history of being very welcoming to all people"" and any refugees would ""benefit the Isle of Man in so many ways"".
""This is an unresolved issue. The Isle of Man gave a very generous donation, but I would hope that it could be reconsidered, and where there's a will, there's a way,"" she added.
Since committing to help those displaced by the Syria conflict in 2014, the UK's Syrian Vulnerable Persons Resettlement Scheme has resettled over 11,000 refugees and plans to help a further 9,000 by 2020.
In February 2017, a petition signed by more than 1,000 people called for the island to take its ""fair share"" and help up to 25 refugees.
However, Mr Quayle said no refugees would be taken. Instead, he pledged £973,000 to help ""provide life-saving humanitarian aid"".
He added that the Council of Ministers believed the Isle of Man could offer ""more effective support to a greater number of people by directing funds to the UN High Commission for Refugees"".

It was daubed on The List, which displays the names of 34,361 asylum seekers, refugees and migrants who have died within or on the borders of Europe since 1993.
Joe Anderson said the offenders ""had their brains invaded by hatred"".
Merseyside Police said it had not received any reports of damage.
The installation on Great George Street is part of a festival of contemporary art running until October. 
Liverpool Biennial, which commissioned the project, is yet to comment.
Designed by artist Banu Cennetoğlu, the memorial has been torn down twice this summer.
In August, she issued a joint statement with Liverpool Biennial saying the work had been ""repeatedly damaged, removed and targeted since it was installed"" on 12 July.
They said The List has not been attacked in any of the other places it has been installed, such as Berlin, Istanbul, Basel and Athens.
The names of those who have died are compiled and updated each year by the anti-discrimination network United for Intercultural Action.
Liverpool Mayor Mr Anderson said: ""To smear them and call them invaders quite frankly is despicable.""
In a tweet, he added: ""Those responsible for this defacement of a memorial to innocent dead people fleeing for their lives, have had their brains invaded by hatred. 
""We will not be beaten by fascist thugs and we will pay for another memorial. I want volunteers to help me protect it.""
Ms Cennetoğlu has translated versions of The List using public spaces such as billboards, transport networks and newspapers since 2007.

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-45271194,refugee,28 August 2018,By Catrin Nye,Children 'attempting suicide' at Greek refugee camp,"At Moria camp on the Greek island of Lesbos, there is deadly violence, overcrowding, appalling sanitary conditions and now a charity says children as young as 10 are attempting suicide. The Victoria Derbyshire programme has been given rare access inside.
""We are always ready to escape, 24 hours a day we have our children ready,"" says Sara Khan, originally from Afghanistan.
""The violence means our little ones don't get to sleep."" 
Sara explains that her family spend all day queuing for food at the camp and all night ready to run - in fear of the fights that break out constantly.
Conditions are so appalling that charities have actually left in protest. 
The place smells of raw sewage, and there are around 70 people per toilet, according to medical charity Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF).
Some people live in mobile cabins, but rammed in-between them all are tents and tarpaulin sheets - homes for those who cannot obtain any official living space.
The camp is also now sprawling into surrounding countryside. One tent houses 17 people - four families under one canvas.
There are currently more than 8,000 people crammed into Moria camp, which was supposed to house around 2,000.
A mum describes faeces on the floor of the shelter that she lives in with her tiny 12-day-old baby.
The violence in the camp is extreme. In May, hundreds of Kurdish people fled because of a huge battle largely between Arab and Kurdish men. 
Ali, who has now left the camp, says when he got to Moria with his family ""we found that there was already existing sectarianism and racism, whether it was between Sunnis and Shias, or Kurds, Arabs and Afghans"".
He adds that conflict between rebel groups in Syria has also landed inside the gates of the refugee camp. 
""It's like the war in Syria and even uglier. We heard about rape cases in there, sexual harassment,"" he says.
Watch Catrin's film in full here.
On the day we are filming at Moria, yet another fight breaks out in the lunch queue for food. Two people are stabbed - others suffer panic attacks witnessing it. 
Nearby medical workers are put on standby at MSF.
The charity initially left the island in protest at conditions, but has now opened a clinic just outside the gates because the need was so great. 
The children they are treating have skin conditions caused by the poor hygiene inside, and respiratory diseases from tear gas fired into the camp by police to quell fights. Mental health problems are rife. 
The workers say they have had to deal with children as young as 10 attempting suicide. 
""It's something we're seeing constantly,"" says Luca Fontana, Lesbos co-ordinator for MSF, adding that they are reporting the conditions to the UN refugee agency UNHCR and Greece's ministry of health.
""Despite the fact that we push to move these children to Athens, as soon as possible, it's not happening. Those children are still here.""
The camp opened in 2015 and was initially designed as a transit post for people to stay for a matter of days - but some have been here for years. 
It is controlled by the Greek government, and the overcrowding is because Greece is enforcing the EU's ""containment"" policy, keeping people on the island rather than transferring them to the Greek mainland.
It is part of the EU-Turkey deal which aims to return thousands of refugees to Turkey, and it has been in force since March 2016. 
From then to July 2018, according to EU figures, 71,645 new refugees arrived in Greece by sea and only 2,224 have been returned to Turkey.
George Matthaiou, a Greek government press representative on Moria, concedes conditions are terrible, but blames the EU rather than Greece. 
""We don't have the money. You know the situation of Greece, economically,"" he says.
""I want to help but I can do nothing, because the European Union closed the borders.""
Back at the MSF tent, Luca Fontana, who has worked all over the world in conflict zones, says the camp is the worst place he has seen in his life. 
He worked during the Ebola outbreaks in West Africa but says, ""I've never seen the level of suffering we are witnessing here every day"".
""Even those affected by Ebola still have the hope to survive or they have the support of their family, their society, their village, their relatives.
""Here, the hope is taken away by the system.""

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-46065716,refugee,1 November 2018,None,Tory MSPs urge UK government to let asylum seekers work,"Scottish Conservative MSPs have joined other parties in urging the UK government to let asylum seekers work.
At present, asylum seekers are not normally allowed to work while waiting for their applications to be decided.
MSPs called on ministers to relax the rules and allow them to take jobs.
Tory member Michelle Ballantyne said she had written to the home secretary arguing that those seeking refuge should have the opportunity to make a ""meaningful contribution"".
The UK government has said it is ""listening carefully"" to the ""complex arguments"" on the subject.
Under present rules, asylum seekers are only allowed to work if they have waited more than a year for a decision on their application, and are able to fill a role on the official ""shortage occupation"" list.
MSPs were debating a motion which called for changes to asylum policy to create a ""long term sustainable solution that does not leave people destitute or homeless at the end of the asylum process"".
The Scottish Conservatives said they had appealed to the Conservative-run UK government to relax rules to let asylum seekers work.
Ms Ballantyne told MSPs: ""During the time that it takes to go through the process of seeking asylum, which can be years, we need to ensure that we don't put people's lives on hold, and we don't waste the skills that people have, or prevent them from developing as people.
""If we don't ensure that asylum seekers have the opportunity to make a meaningful contribution to their own lives, as well as their host nation, we do everyone a disservice.
""While I appreciate that asylum seekers can currently engage in voluntary work, if we really want to ensure that individuals are able to prosper both here, and should they ever wish to return to their countries, the prospect of employment is essential.""
The move was welcomed by MSPs from other parties, who were critical of the UK's asylum policy during the Holyrood debate.
Communities Secretary Aileen Campbell said the Scottish government's key principle was one of ""integration from day one"".
She said: ""This means that people should be welcomed and supported to integrate from day one, not just when refugee status and leave to remain have been granted.
""People seeking asylum have to navigate a complex and often frustrating system sometimes over many years before they receive refugee status and are able to get on with their lives.
""That is often at great cost to their mental health and future prospects.""
In a debate at Westminster in October, Immigration Minister Caroline Nokes said she was ""listening carefully to the complex arguments about permitting asylum seekers to work"".
She said there was a ""balance to be struck"", and that current policy ""seeks to protect the resident labour market and ensure that any employment meets our needs for skilled labour"".
But she said there was ""much merit"" in the argument that asylum seekers should be allowed to work, saying she was ""receptive to the views and evidence presented to me on the right to work"".

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-45377336,refugee,1 September 2018,None,US ends aid to Palestinian refugee agency Unrwa,"The United States is ending all funding for the UN's Palestinian refugee agency, the US State Department says.
It described the organisation, the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (Unrwa), as ""irredeemably flawed"".
The US administration has ""carefully reviewed"" the issue and ""will not make additional contributions to Unrwa,"" spokeswoman Heather Nauert said.
A spokesman for Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas later said the move was an ""assault"" against his people. 
""Such a punishment will not succeed to change the fact that the United States no longer has a role in the region and that it is not a part of the solution,"" Nabil Abu Rudeina told Reuters news agency.
He added that the decision was ""a defiance of UN resolutions"".
A spokesman for Unrwa, Chris Gunness, defended the agency in a series of tweets. 
""We reject in the strongest possible terms the criticism that Unrwa's schools, health centres, and emergency assistance programs are 'irredeemably flawed',"" he wrote.
The latest move comes after the US announced back in January that it would withhold more than half of a tranche of funding for the agency.
Unrwa was originally set up to take care of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians displaced by the 1948 Arab-Israeli war.
The agency says it currently supports more than five million Palestinians in Gaza, the West Bank, Jordan, Syria and Lebanon, including providing health care, education and social services.
The US has been the largest single donor to Unrwa, providing $364m (£283m) in 2017 and funding almost 30% of its operations in the region.
The Trump administration had pledged $60m to Unrwa in January, but withheld another $65m. 
The remaining payment of $65m is now expected to be cancelled.
The US disagrees with Unrwa, and Palestinian officials, on a number of issues.
US President Donald Trump has previously complained that the US received ""no appreciation or respect"" for the large sums of aid it provided to the region.
Earlier this year, he threatened to cut aid to the Palestinians over what he called their unwillingness to negotiate with Israel.
The US and Israel also disagree with Unrwa on which Palestinians are refugees with a right to return to the homes they fled following the 1948 war.
Nikki Haley, the US ambassador to the UN, said earlier this week that Unrwa exaggerated the number of Palestinian refugees, and needed to reform. 
""You're looking at the fact that, yes, there's an endless number of refugees that continue to get assistance, but more importantly, the Palestinians continue to bash America,"" she said.
The state department says the US is contributing a ""very disproportionate share of the burden of Unrwa's costs"". 
It complains of a business model and fiscal practices, linked to an ""exponentially expanding community of entitled beneficiaries"", which is ""unsustainable and has been in crisis mode for many years"".  
On Friday, the Palestinian representative in Washington, Hossam Zomlot, accused the US of ""endorsing the most extreme Israeli narrative on all issues including the rights of more than five million Palestinian refugees"". 
The US ""is damaging not only an already volatile situation but the prospects for future peace"", he told AFP. 
Palestinian officials have already accused the Trump administration of worsening tensions due to its pro-Israel stance.
In December, Mr Trump controversially recognised Jerusalem as Israel's capital, despite it being claimed by both sides.
His move overturned decades of US neutrality on the issue, attracted international criticism, and led to the Palestinian Authority cutting off dialogue in Washington. 
In May, the US also opened an embassy in Jerusalem, a move described by Palestinian officials as a ""blatant provocation"".  
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has previously called for Unrwa's funding to be cut gradually and its responsibilities transferred to the UN's global refugee agency, the UNHCR, arguing that it ""perpetuates the Palestinian problem"".
However, he said that ""every step taken also contains some risk"".
Some Israelis have raised concerns that weakening Unrwa could cause regional instability and create more extremism in the region.
Earlier on Friday, German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said his country would increase its contributions to the agency because its funding crisis was fuelling uncertainty. 
""The loss of this organisation could unleash an uncontrollable chain reaction,"" Mr Maas said.
Meanwhile, the UN's secretary general, Antonio Guterres, has said he has ""full confidence"" in Unrwa, and called on other countries ""to help fill the remaining financial gap"".

Kate Milner, from Leighton Buzzard, Bedfordshire, wrote and illustrated My Name is Not Refugee as a mature student in Cambridge.
The story follows a young boy and his mother facing an uncertain future as they embark on life in a refugee camp.
Author and Klaus Flugge Prize judge Lauren Child said the book gave readers ""a chance to imagine and to empathise"".
Mother-of-three Mrs Milner, who is in her fifties and spent much of her career as a librarian, graduated from the MA in Children's Book Illustration at Anglia Ruskin University in 2016, and began working on the book in the final months of her course.
She said she wanted My Name is Not Refugee to make children from a comfortable background think about what it would be like to have to leave home.
""There had been a lot in the tabloids about Syrian refugees and so much of it was negative,"" she said. ""I wanted to do something to help the situation.
""I knew it would be a book for teachers, librarians and parents, to explain, not to be propaganda, this is what being a refugee means and this is what the children are going through.""
On Wednesday, Mrs Milner was announced as the winner of this year's £5,000 Klaus Flugge Prize, presented to the most exciting newcomer in children's picture book illustration. The book had previously earned Mrs Milner the V&A Student Illustrator of the Year award in 2016. 
Martin Salisbury, Professor of Illustration at Anglia Ruskin, described the book as a ""stand-out project"".

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-45036809,refugee,1 August 2018,None,'Hunger strike' over refugee evictions,"Two Afghan men have gone on hunger strike outside the Home Office in Glasgow after being told they are to be evicted from their homes.
Rahman Shah and Irwais Ahmadzai are among 300 asylum seekers in the city facing eviction by contractor Serco after being refused refugee status.
Mr Shah and Mr Ahmadzi say Afghanistan is not a safe place to return to.
And they say they will continue their protest until the Home Office agrees to look again at their cases.
Serco is employed by the Home Office to provide accommodation for about 5,000 asylum seekers in Glasgow, but says it often has to provide housing without recompense, sometimes for months, for failed former asylum seekers who have no right to stay in the UK.
On Monday, it issued notices to six of those affected warning that their locks will be changed within seven days. 
Historically, lock changes have not been used for those who remain in asylum accommodation despite the Home Office ruling they will not be granted refugee status and withdrawing their funding and support.
Serco insists it is ""sympathetic"" to those affected, but the company has been heavily criticised by politicians and refugee charities, who accuse it of putting profit before people.  
Mr Shah and Mr Ahmadzi have both been told by Serco that they are to be evicted, which they say will leave them homeless, but are not among the six who have been given lock change notices.
Mr Shah told BBC Scotland that he had been born in a refugee camp in Pakistan 32 years ago, and had been a refugee his entire life.
He said he had been ""so happy"" when he came to the UK because he had been told there was ""lots of freedom, lots of opportunities here"" but he now believe that ""they don't have human rights here"".
He added: ""We are stuck here, no house and not allowed to work - where is the human rights?
""If they give to us status we will start a new life. In the UK a dog has a passport, a cat has a passport but I don't have any passport"". 
Mr Shah, who says he arrived in the UK last year, also says he has hepatitis, and needs weekly injections in his stomach. 
His companion, Mr Ahmadzi, says he came to Scotland 12 years ago after fleeing Afghanistan, which he said was still too dangerous to return to despite claims to the contrary from the Home Office.
Mr Shah and Mr Ahmadzi are being supported by the Scottish Afghan Society who said the two men will continue their hunger strike ""until someone comes out from the Home Office and meets them and agrees to look at their case again.""
Serco insists that it is acting ""fully within the law"" by serving eviction notices on people who have not been granted refugee status, but solicitors at the Govan Law Centre have said they will mount legal challenges on behalf of those affected. 
About 500 people gathered in the city centre on Tuesday evening to protest against Serco's move and to show solidarity with refugees and asylum seekers, with further protests held on Wednesday. 
Glasgow City Council says it is in the process of establishing a task force to respond to the ""emerging humanitarian crisis"" and has written to Home Secretary Sajid Javid urging him to instruct Serco to pause its plans.
A spokesman for the Home Office said asylum seekers who would otherwise be destitute are provided with free, fully furnished accommodation while applications are considered. 
He added: ""We also cover utility costs and provide a cash allowance to cover other essential living needs.
""While an asylum claim or an appeal is outstanding, we would not be seeking removal. 
""If the courts have decided that someone has no right to remain in the United Kingdom it is right that they should leave the UK.
""However if an asylum claim has failed, we will still provide accommodation for those who would otherwise be destitute and who are temporarily unable to leave the UK because of a practical or legal obstacle.""
Meanwhile, on Wednesday Serco pledged families will not be put at risk over the next month.
The firm also denied claims it has failed to engage with local authorities and it said it is saving the council a bill in excess of £1m a year for 330 people who are no longer receiving support from the Home Office.
In response to the Glasgow City Council letter Serco chief executive Rupert Soames wrote: ""We are giving financial and welfare support to vulnerable people for many months, and in some cases more than a year, after their asylum claims have been refused. 
""This is currently costing Serco over a million pounds a year, which costs would have to be borne by the Council if we were not doing it.""
He also welcomed the fact the the issue is now being debated.
The letter continued: ""The one positive outcome of the events of recent days is that it has put very firmly on people's agenda the nature of the crisis. 
""This is that the local arrangements once Home Office support has ceased are inadequate, and we are put into the impossible position of having to make the choice of paying for people's accommodation ourselves, or making them homeless and destitute.""
Serco said its reluctance to evict people has resulted in the number of people whose housing it is paying for increasing from 167 to 330 in the year.
And it claimed many of these people are single males who no longer have the right to remain in the UK. 
At the same time Serco said it has to find housing for around 180 new asylum seekers, including families with children, who arrive in Glasgow each month. 
The company said it is no longer willing to provide ""unlimited free accommodation to over-stayers"". 
But while a long term solution is devised it has made three pledges for the next four weeks.
Serco said it will restrict the number of people issued with lock-change notices to no more than 10 a week.
It vowed none of these will be families with children.
And it said only people who have exhausted the Home Office appeal process and no longer have the right to remain in the country will be targeted.

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-45272544,refugee,23 August 2018,None,GCSE results: Syrian refugee's long road to exam success,"Like many 16-year-olds Hasna Ali has had an anxious morning collecting her GCSE results. 
But her journey to this point could not be more different to her peers at Ysgol Y Grango school in Rhos, Wrexham. 
Two years ago she arrived in the UK speaking barely a word of English, having spent three years in an Iraqi refugee camp after fleeing her home in Syria. 
She got a B in Arabic, C in art and design, and DD in science double award. 
Hasna now plans to go to college to do GSCEs in Maths and English as a second language. 
She said: ""I'm happy. I'm excited for the college and doing hard work.""
The war in Syria has claimed the lives of an estimated half a million people. 
According to the United Nations (UN) at least 6.1 million people have had to flee their homes inside Syria, while another 5.6 million have fled abroad since the war began more than seven years ago.
Recalling life before she came to Wales, Hasna said: ""It was a very dangerous place to live.
""If we'd stayed in Syria maybe we'd have been killed - I don't know.""
Hasna said before fleeing their home in Al Hafaka, she, her parents and three siblings - then aged seven, five and seven months - often went hungry: ""We didn't have nice food.  It was so difficult to find food or bread or anything.
""We didn't have anything. Life was difficult.""
And it was particularly tough with a new baby in the house: ""It was very very difficult because she needed milk.""
The dangers of travelling to school meant she and her two younger brothers often went without education and were instead marooned in their house. 
Her parents took the difficult decision to move their children out of Syria. Hasna's father stayed behind to care for relatives and her mother braved the five-hour walk to Iraq with her four young children alone. 
""She was very tired and it was very, very difficult,"" remembers Hasna. 
They left all their possessions at home: ""[We took] nothing, just some clothes, just one bag.""
They eventually arrived at a Unicef refugee camp where they were to remain for three years. 
""It wasn't too nice because you worry about everything, you can't sleep at night because you don't know the people you're next to,"" she said.
""Life had changed. Everything had changed from when we were in Syria. I didn't know people, it wasn't my home."" 
Her father joined them after one year: ""It's difficult and hard to explain not seeing your father for a long time. I missed him too much."" 
The family were eventually flown to the UK in September 2016 as part of the UK government's resettlement scheme.
They were granted refugee leave which allows them to stay for five years before an official review determines whether they can safely return to Syria. 
""I don't want to go. I want to stay here for my studies and to become a doctor - a surgeon,"" she said.
""I have friends and everything is all right, and I love Wrexham always because the people in Wales are very nice.""
Minister for Immigration Caroline Nokes said: ""I would like to send my warmest congratulations to Hasna on her impressive GCSE results.
""As a country we can be proud that we have resettled 12,851 vulnerable refugees fleeing Syria through our Vulnerable Persons Resettlement Scheme.

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-edinburgh-east-fife-45220898,refugee,17 August 2018,None,Teenager jailed for trying to murder Syrian refugee in Edinburgh,"A teenager has been sentenced to seven years and nine months in detention for attempting to murder a Syrian refugee.
Sean Gorman, 18, stabbed Shabaz Ali, 25, six times in the attack in an Edinburgh hostel on 3 May, leaving him with life-threatening injuries.
Gorman, who admitted the racially aggravated attack, will be supervised for four years after his release.
Judge Lord Woolman said the ""frenzied"" assault had caused Mr Ali ""serious physical and psychological harm"".
Gorman will begin his sentence when he has finished serving 169 days of a previous sentence, from 2017, for assault to severe injury and the danger of life.
The court heard that Gorman had drunk most of a litre bottle of vodka and taken ecstasy and cocaine, and was described as being ""hyper"" before the attack.
Mr Ali was stabbed after complaining about loud music which prevented him from sleeping in the hostel in Upper Gilmore Place.
Lord Woolman said: ""The attack has caused Mr Ali serious physical and psychological harm.
""He cannot work. He can only take short walks with the aid of a walking stick. He awaits further surgery.""
The judge told Gorman he had carried out a ""frenzied attack"" on a stranger.
""You stabbed him six times, five times in the upper chest - but you would have been a threat to anyone you came across that night,"" he said.
Mr Ali's lawyer, Aamer Anwar, said his client's father Silvan Ali welcomed the ""significant sentence"" and ""the message sent out to violent racists like Sean Gorman"".
He said Gorman had racially abused and threatened Shabaz Ali and his female cousin, who he was trying to protect.
Mr Anwar said Mr Ali was a Kurdish man who had sought sanctuary in Scotland after escaping from ISIS, who had murdered nine members of his family in Syria.
He added that Mr Ali was ""lucky to be alive"", and that it was likely he would never fully recover from the attack.
Mr Ali, who fled to Scotland five years ago with his family, had been working as a barber and living in the hostel while he looked for a new home.
Gorman had been visiting the hostel when the attack took place.
Mr Ali had gone to one of the rooms to complain about the noise, and found Gorman inside.
In an interview with BBC Scotland, Mr Ali said Gorman had told him to ""go back to your country"".
Mr Ali pressed the button for security, but Gorman pulled out a lock-knife.
""He said if you don't go to your room I will stab you, but I was scared to go to my room because I thought he wanted to kill me in the room because there is no CCTV in the room,"" he said.
At the High Court in Edinburgh, Gorman admitted racially-aggravated attempted murder, as well as causing racially-aggravated alarm to another woman in the hostel.
Det Ch Insp Paul Grainger, of Police Scotland, said: ""Gorman used appalling racist language before perpetrating significant violence against the victim, who was left fighting for his life.
""I cannot condemn the circumstances of this case strongly enough. Edinburgh thrives on diversity and Gorman's actions do not in any way reflect the values of our city. 
""Significant support has been shown across the capital for the victim and his family, which is far more representative of the strength of inclusivity across our communities.""

Omar Ameen, 45, appeared before a magistrate in California on Wednesday in connection with proceedings to extradite him to Iraq to face trial.
An Iraqi arrest warrant alleges that Mr Ameen shot the policeman dead during a raid on the town of Rawah in June 2014.
He arrived in the US five months later and settled in Sacramento.
US prosecutors said Mr Ameen applied to the US for refugee status while living in Turkey after saying he was a victim of persecution and violence.
He was granted refugee status days before the attack in Rawah, which took place as IS seized control of large swathes of western and northern Iraq.
US prosecutors allege that Mr Ameen's family supported and assisted the installation of IS and its precursor, al-Qaeda in Iraq (AQI), in Rawah, and that he was ""a main local figure"" of both groups.
They say he participated in various activities in support of the groups, including helping to plant improvised explosive devices, transporting militants, soliciting funds, robbing supply lorries and kidnapping drivers.
The Iraqi arrest warrant says that on 22 June 2014, Mr Ameen entered Rawah with a convoy of IS vehicles and drove to the house of the policeman, Ihsan Jasim. 
Mr Ameen and five other militants then opened fire at the house, with Mr Ameen fatally shooting the officer in the chest, the warrant alleges.
At Wednesday's hearing, federal magistrate judge Edmund Brennan ordered Mr Ameen to be detained until his next court appearance, accepting the prosecutors' arguments that he posed a danger to the community and a flight risk.
There was no immediate response to the allegations from Mr Ameen's lawyers. 
The Sacramento Bee newspaper cited public defenders Benjamin Galloway and Douglas Beevers as saying they were assigned the case minutes before the hearing and that their client was ""aware of the basic nature of the charges"".
He could be executed in Iraq if convicted of ""organised killing by an armed group"".

Rohullah Yakobi said he felt ""immense pain"" when his British-born son Sa-aadat, 10, burst into tears after overhearing the incident on Thursday.
Mr Yakobi, from Wolverhampton, tweeted what happened when he went to speak to neighbours and has been overwhelmed by the response he has received.
West Midlands Police is investigating.
Mr Yakobi, 30, who also has a five-year-old daughter called Roya, fled Afghanistan as a 12-year-old after being captured by the Taliban and then moved to Britain in 2004.
He said he had gone to speak to his neighbours about an issue when he was told by a woman he ""didn't belong in this country"".
""I am a British Citizen, I do all I can to repay Britain for what it has done for me and I want to make sure my children grow up with a strong sense of belonging to this country,"" he said.
""I felt immense pain, not at what was said, but the fact that my son stood there watching and burst into tears. That actually hurt me.
""It is painful trying to make sense of it.""
Since Mr Yakobi tweeted authors, including Danny Wallace, have offered to send copies of books to Sa-aadat to make him feel better.
Mr Yakobi added: ""I did the tweet because I felt it was the only way I could express myself, not for sympathy but to talk about lasting impact of things.
""We were just overwhelmed with the response.""
West Midlands Police said inquires are continuing into what happened.

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-45372942,refugee,31 August 2018,By Catrin Nye and Leo Sands,UN urges Greece to act as Moria refugee camp reaches 'boiling point',"The UN refugee agency has urged Greece to move asylum seekers off Lesbos after the Victoria Derbyshire programme exposed appalling conditions.
It said the Moria camp was ""reaching boiling point"" and the Greek government should rapidly speed up the process of transferring people to the mainland.
The camp has capacity for about 2,000 but is currently home to some 8,000, with violence and sexual assault rife.
The Greek government has been approached for comment. 
Living standards inside the camp are so bad that many charities refuse to operate inside in protest. The day we filmed there, two people were stabbed in the lunch queue.
""We are particularly concerned about woefully inadequate sanitary facilities, fighting amongst frustrated communities, rising levels of sexual harassment and assaults and the increasing need for medical and psycho-social care,"" Charlie Yaxley, spokesman for the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), told a Geneva briefing.
Mr Yaxley said the Greek government had made previous commitments to transfer people to shelters on the mainland and had received European Union funding for it.
The UNHCR called on the Greek authorities to rapidly speed up transfer of those eligible to mainland Greece and to increase capacity on the mainland to house them.
It also urged them to quickly improve conditions in camps on the Greek islands and to provide alternative accommodation for the most vulnerable.
Moria camp was meant to be a ""reception and identification centre"" (RIC), rather than a refugee camp housing people for extended periods of time. It does not meet the standards required to be an official camp.
Lawyers working inside say that, in the worst cases, some people have been there for two years. 
The UNHCR said that despite 1,350 refugees and asylum seekers being transferred to mainland sites in August, that had failed to ease pressure because an average of 114 people arrived each day during the same month, up from 83 in July.
It said more than 70% were families from Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan. 
Watch Catrin's film in full here.
Earlier this week, medical charity MSF told the BBC that children as young as 10 were trying to take their lives inside Moria camp.
The place smelt of raw sewage and there were around 70 people per toilet, it said.
Reacting to the UN statement Louise Roland-Gosselin, head of mission for MSF in Greece, said immediate action was needed.
""This is a crisis in overcrowding - a health and mental-health crisis and a crisis of protection"" she said.
""Our medical teams and experts expect to treat people for trauma they have experienced in their country of origin. But they are treating trauma that has happened in Greece.
""We have children as young as 10 who are suicidal because of the fear and desperation they have faced in Greece.""
The UN also criticised overcrowding on other Greek islands, adding that another centre on Samos holds 2,700 people, nearly four times the number it was designed for. 
Centres on the islands of Chios and Kos are at close to double their capacity.
On Thursday, the European Commission said it had seen the BBC report about Moria and was carefully monitoring the spending of €1.6m (£1.43m) allocated to Greece for migrant reception centres and improving conditions. 
It said there had been a ""difficulty on the Greek side"" in making use of the funds.

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-44309333,refugee,11 August 2018,By Georgina Rannard,The Syrian refugee who feeds everyone she meets,"She was alone, separated from her children, without her home or work. But facing circumstances that could break even the strongest spirits, Majeda refused to give in. She turned to something she hoped would build her a new life - food. 
The first big dinner Majeda Khoury hosted was a strange one - the menu was unappetising and the guests of honour couldn't attend.
Though she had arrived in Britain just five months earlier, the long guest list she put together was one to be proud of.
Two speakers appeared on a screen via Skype in the comfortable London venue. When guests looked past the face of one, a mother of three, they would see grey, shell-pocked walls.
Live from war-torn Eastern Ghouta, Syria, the doctor and activist explained to their fellow guests what civilians there were living through - a five-year siege, hunger, destroyed hospitals, chemical attacks, and brutal shelling by President Bashar al-Assad's government. Just leaving the house could get them killed.
As the diners listened, they ate a thin soup ""because that's all there was to eat in Eastern Ghouta"". Majeda, 46, remembers that she left the event happily carrying more than 100 letters asking the British government to take humanitarian action. 
Though something as simple as a sharing a dinner table will not solve the refugee crisis, meals like this are how Majeda, a Syrian human rights activist who fled to Britain in 2017, finds a place in the hearts of strangers she meets.
Feeding people gives her a way to tell her story. It helps her continue the work for which she was persecuted at home. 
Crucially, deprived of mothering the sons who adored her cooking and are now growing older in Damascus, food has helped Majeda build a second family, made up of new friends.
Majeda never wanted to live in Britain. Before the uprising in her country, she led a privileged life as a children's counsellor running a family education centre. She took pleasure in raising her boys, Hadi and Karim, and together with her husband, they lived in a ""beautiful home"" in Damascus.
When pro-democracy protests broke out against President Assad's rule in 2011, she joined them, but she stopped as the uprising spiralled into conflict. Instead, she worked to help victims of the war. But in 2015 she was imprisoned after helping to feed refugees arriving in her city from other parts of Syria.
The government, like other groups, was accused of using food as a weapon and preventing supplies reaching areas where people opposed it. ""But as a wealthy, Christian woman, I could pass through checkpoints. And so I used to smuggle bread to feed people. I couldn't watch them starve,"" Majeda says.
Fearing for the safety of her own family, Majeda fled to neighbouring Lebanon, leaving her sons behind with their father. They were 13 and 15.
Being an activist in Lebanon was risky, but she persisted and in 2017 was invited to speak at a conference in the UK.  While in Britain, Majeda got news that her colleagues were being arrested and, believing she was in danger, she sought political asylum. From working to protect refugees, she became one of them, dislocated indefinitely from family and home.
The first weeks in Britain were extremely difficult. But she quickly realised that the cuisine of her home, Damascus, one of the world's oldest cities, had an audience in London.
Food is a cornerstone of Syrian culture and family life. It's often elaborate and complicated, fiddly and full of rich and colourful ingredients - red pomegranate seeds that shine like jewels, purple fleshy aubergines, green fresh Aleppo pistachios, golden tahina sauce from sesame seeds. It is said that the ""eyes eat before the mouth"". 
Most women in Syria do not work - in 2013 14% of the workforce was female - and so they still do the vast majority of cooking and housework.
You might also be interested in:
""Our kitchen was twice the size of kitchens in the UK - it's a very important part of a Syrian house. I cooked for my husband and my children - they loved my food, especially how I present meals,"" she says. 
Before war disrupted normal life, a wife or mother could spend hours each day chopping, peeling, stuffing, roasting, and rolling ingredients.
Kibbeh is one popular snack - a deep fried ball of meat and nuts that needs nimble and skilled fingers to prepare. One cookbook from Aleppo lists 26 varieties but it's often just one of many dishes on a dining table. 
""Syrian women are very patient because we have to make a lot of dishes. For example, we spend three hours making yebra [vine leaves] - and then they eat it in seconds.  We don't use measuring spoons - we just know what should go in,"" Majeda says, laughing.
Asylum seekers in the UK are not allowed to work and Majeda spent her first year in London relying on the generosity of strangers, moving home five times. 
In each place, she made sure no-one went hungry. Although, as any cook knows, adapting to someone else's kitchen and habits is no mean feat. 
She stayed first with an Italian-French couple. ""They had a fantastic kitchen, small but full of equipment. We had a competition every night, taking it in turns to see who could cook better."" Realising she was separated from her family, Majeda's host, a photographer, surprised her by framing pictures of her children.
In another place, she ate lunch every day with the host, who had retired while his wife continued to work. ""We remain friends now and they send me messages about how much they miss my food.""
She also lived with another Syrian woman, feeding her children while she was at work. ""I still send them food parcels when I make something I know they like.""
""I felt able to give something back to the people I stayed with.""
She also met old-timers and new arrivals in the growing Syrian community in London. ""There are many students here alone, so I asked them, 'What do you miss from your mum's cooking?' and I did it for them instead.""
But while Majeda cooked for other people's children in Britain, her husband had arranged for someone else to make meals for their sons. Karim, the youngest, took an interest in food and sometimes called Majeda to ask for recipe advice.
""It made me feel very, very sad - I missed my children. They were without their mother - and here I was cooking for strangers. It was very emotional. I thought to myself, one day they'll come here and I'll be able to cook for them again."" 
Majeda struggled to forget her fellow Syrians whom she felt she had ""abandoned"".
""I had no right to leave. I feel guilty, because it was people like me that started those demonstrations [against the government] and then we left. I felt so far away from them and their suffering. I wanted to carry on my work"" she says.
As an asylum seeker from a wealthy, urban background, Majeda is in a stronger position than many Syrian refugees in the UK. Most are eligible to come to Britain due only to disabilities or health problems, causing them to be selected for the government's Vulnerable Person Resettlement Scheme.
Majeda speaks good English and her confident and commanding presence makes it clear she is used to people listening to her. 
One of her early decisions in London was to join a refugee cooking group run by social enterprise Migrateful. It brings together Londoners and refugees to learn recipes and share a meal. 
She gives one or two classes a week, teaching simple but beautiful meals that can be reproduced at home. One of the easier dishes is mutabel, which is made by blending smoked aubergine with tahina (sesame sauce), yogurt, lemon, pomegranate syrup and garlic. 
Another is tabouleh salad. Students must chop the parsley leaves ""very very finely"", mixing them with bulgar wheat (a grain similar to couscous), tomatoes, and spring onions.
One meal that she says everyone loves is harra esbou, or ""he's burnt his fingers"", a nod to how tasty it is. A traditional Damascene dish with a ""sweet and sour"" taste that comes from strained tamarind and pomegranate syrup, it's made with lentils and pasta, adorned with garlic, coriander and fried bread. 
When she first arrived, Majeda wanted to tell everyone she met about the war, believing they didn't understand the full picture. She found that it depressed or fatigued people.
But when she started to teach, she discovered the dinners gave her an opportunity to really talk and to continue her activism. Over food, she describes how civilians are targeted in Syria's war and how the pro-democracy movement was ""crushed by President Assad"".
A lesson in politics over dinner may not be everyone's cup of tea, but Majeda says that most people are receptive. ""Food is very important. When you share food with people, they will care more about you and listen to you."" 
Picking up on a trend in the capital for Syrian cultural events to raise money for refugees, she also started a monthly supper club. Some of the feasts mark events such as Easter or Eid at the end of Ramadan and they quickly sell out. 
Cooking the food she is so familiar with is comforting and cathartic - but it also gives her dignity in the face of pity she feels from organisations or people who see refugees as ""helpless"" charity cases.
It's a link to the home she never wanted to leave. But it's also a lifeline, her way of meeting people and finding a purpose in exile.
In April this year, Majeda laid the dinner table in another unfamiliar house. After months of waiting for a family reunion visa, her sons were finally joining her.
London's high rents made it hard to find a place for them to live but a Syrian-Irish couple invited them to stay for a few days for the reunion. ""They knew I wanted to be prepared and to make a meal for my children. They have a very special kitchen. They took me to a Syrian store so I could buy what I needed to cook.""
""I made my sons' favourite dish, shakriyeh [lamb cooked in yogurt with rice], with mutabel and tabouleh salad. It was really a fantastic dinner that we all shared together.""
The teenagers, who learned English at school in Syria, are shy but adapting to life in the UK. ""My family like British food because it's full of fat - they like fat,"" she says. ""I made English breakfast for them when they arrived but personally my stomach can't cope with it.""
Majeda says she wakes up every day hoping that she can return to Syria. She doesn't want the country ""left in the hands of the government"". 
But she is also hoping to start a catering business in London, renting a kitchen and offering employment to other Syrian women. She thinks her country's food is growing on the capital.
When Majeda, Hadi and Karim finally moved into their own place recently, she held a housewarming party. Guests brought gifts to help them feel at home. Knowing their friend, they brought her pans and pots, knives and chopping boards, everything a good family kitchen needs.

""During the early stages of the crisis, living conditions were bleak - but life has been slowly improving for the refugees living here,"" says Trenchard. 
""Uganda's policy towards refugees is often used as an example for other countries. 
""Each family is granted a small plot of land to farm, and is free to do business in the country. Days are filled with chores, cooking, farming, play and endless waiting.""
Following the signing of a peace deal many of the refugees will hope they can return home in the near future.

Professor Caucher Birkar, a Kurd, came to the UK as a refugee from Iran.
He was one of four people honoured for their contributions to mathematics and had said that he ""couldn't imagine that this would come true"".
But just minutes later, he discovered that the 14-carat gold medal had gone missing.
According to Brazil's TV Globo, he left it along with his wallet and phone in a briefcase on a table at the convention centre where the event was taking place. 
He alerted security staff when he noticed the case was missing and they later found the case, but both his medal and his wallet were no longer there.
Caucher Birkar was born on a farm in Kurdistan Province, near the Iran-Iraq border, and was raised during the eight-year war between the two neighbouring countries that broke out in 1980.
He told Quanta magazine that while he was growing up, his maths club in Tehran had pictures of Fields Medal winners lining the walls. 
""I looked at them and said to myself, 'will I ever meet one of these people?' At that time in Iran, I couldn't even know that I'd be able to go to the West,"" he said.
While studying for his undergraduate degree at the University of Tehran, he travelled to the UK and sought political asylum there.
He established a reputation within academia with his work on birational geometry and has previously won the prestigious Leverhulme Prize.

Caucher Birkar, Alessio Figalli and Peter Scholze, and Akshay Venkatesh are all honoured for major contributions to their respective areas in mathematics.
Professor Birkar, a Kurd, came to the UK as a while studying in Tehran and applied for asylum.
The University of Cambridge mathematician said he ""couldn't imagine that this would come true"".
However, it emerged that the 14-carat gold medal given to Dr Birkar at the ceremony in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, had been stolen just minutes later.

The Fields Medals are awarded every four years to the most promising mathematicians under the age of 40.
Each winner receives a C$15,000 ($11,500; £8,800) cash prize. 
Alessio Figalli, 34, was born in Rome but works at ETH Zurich, a science and technology university in Switzerland. He is an expert on calculus of variations and partial differential equations.
""This prize gives me so much joy,"" Professor Figalli told the Italian news agency Ansa. ""It is such a big thing that I'm struggling to believe that I have received it.
""It is a great stimulus for the future,"" he added. ""It will motivate me to work in my research fields to try to produce studies of a very high level"".
The youngest of the four, Peter Scholze, who is 30, works at the University of Bonn. His research focuses on the intersection between number theory and geometry. He was widely tipped to win the prize ahead of the announcement.
The Australian Professor Venkatesh, 36, studies number theory and representation theory.
Professor Martin Hairer, from Imperial College London, who was awarded the Fields Medal in 2014, said the award could be transformative for the winners.  
He told BBC News: ""As you can imagine, their status will instantly change from 'highly respected researcher in the area of XXX' to 'celebrity in the mathematics community'. In the short term, this will give them a level of exposure that mathematicians are typically not used to and they'll have to figure out how to deal with that.
""At a less ephemeral level, it makes them figureheads within mathematics for their area of research, so they will spend much more time communicating to a broader audience than what they are probably used to.""
There have been 56 winners, though one of them - the Russian Grigori Perelman - declined the award in 2006. Dr Perelman was famously reclusive and shunned attention in favour of working on his favoured fields.
There has been only one woman winner - the Iranian Maryam Mirzakhani. A professor at Stanford University in the US, she died in 2017.
Cédric Villani made a move into politics after winning the prize in 2010. Last year, he became a National Assembly member in his native France for Emmanuel Macron's En Marche party.
Martin Hairer added: ""At the end of the day, while some of the laureates have capitalised on their medal to initiate a change of career (Cédric Villani comes to mind), most of them continue to produce outstanding research in their chosen area and, to a large extent, lead the same kind of life as any other highly successful mathematician.""
At least two, and preferably four people, are always honoured in the award ceremony. 
The prize was inaugurated in 1932 at the request of Canadian mathematician John Charles Fields, who ran the 1924 Mathematics Congress in Toronto.
The medals themselves are still produced by the Canadian mint.
The awards were announced at the International Congress of Mathematicians in Rio de Janeiro.

The Dirar family spent four years living at a refugee camp in Egypt after fleeing Western Sudan. They resettled in Hull in 2015.
They said they painted as a way of coping with their journey and asylum.
The tent art installation has gone on show in the city as part of the annual Freedom Festival.
Single mother Arafa Hassan Gouda said she and her six children - Mayas, Gaida, Ethar, Amr, Waieel and Akram - had to cross borders in the back of trucks, in cars and on boats before resettling in the city through the government's UN gateway resettlement programme.
Their journey involved crossing Libya and the Mediterranean Sea, including living in cramped conditions in a tent in the Salloum Refugee Camp.
To help her children cope and to boost their spirits, Mrs Gouda organised art workshops and drawing competitions after getting basic drawing materials from aid agencies at the camp. 
Ethar Dirar was just 12 when she fled Darfur before arriving at the camp.
""In the camp no-one had an identity,"" she said. ""It was so many things. It was the opposite at the same time - it was home and not home.""
Ethar said the artwork was ""a lot about escaping to another place"".
""The reality at that time wasn't the best place you want to be in,"" she added.
The exhibition, titled Drawing Time - Our Story, features paintings, poetry and sketches about life in the camp. 
It will be held at the Wilberforce Institute for the Study of Slavery and Emancipation. 
Mrs Gouda said: ""I hope people can have a closer look and feel and understand what a refugee would go through in a refugee camp.
""It's a difficult journey but it also has a positive side.""
Mayas Dirar added: ""I don't think just the art can let people imagine how [refugees were] living there. 
""But I try to let people [see how] we was living and how we was sitting in the camp for a long, long time.""
Drawing Time - Our Story runs between 1 August and 9 September.

Lord Alf Dubs, a former child refugee, has called on the Isle of Man, Jersey and Guernsey's governments to ""share"" the responsibility.
More than 11,000 Syrian refugees have been accepted by the UK since 2014 but none have been accepted by the islands.
The Home Office would ""welcome"" the assistance, Minister Baroness Williams said.
However, the island governments have re-iterated their position of not accepting refugees as part of the UK's Vulnerable Persons Relocation scheme.
They cite legal hurdles and also point to the ""life-saving humanitarian aid"" they have funded since the conflict in Syria began.
Lord Dubs was the architect of a 2016 scheme which saw hundreds of unaccompanied children come and live in the UK, although it was later scrapped.
On the islands taking refugees, he said: ""I have a sense that there is support in the Crown Dependencies, certainly in the Isle of Man there's quite a lot of support.
""It's a matter of sharing responsibility. 
""I think small as the territories are, Jersey and Guernsey are able, I think, to provide a bit of support. 
""They are quite wealthy, they have the resources, and I think in the spirit of international cooperation they could do a little bit to help take some of the refugees - either children or families,"" he added.
On Monday 15 October, Lord Dubs was told the UK Government would ""welcome"" any offers from the dependencies to house refugees as part of UK schemes ""now or in the future"".

The attack followed a row about noise Gorman was making in a hostel.
The teenager will be sentenced at the High Court in Edinburgh on 17 August.
Mr Ali had fled to Scotland five years ago with his family and was working as a barber and staying in the hostel as he looked for a new home.
Gorman had been visiting the hostel before the row broke out.
Mr Ali called at the room after he heard noise was coming from and found Gorman inside. He said Gorman was saying ""Go back to your country.""
Mr Ali told BBC Scotland: ""I pressed the button for security.
""He (Gorman) took the knife out and said 'I'm going to stab you.' Security did nothing.
""He said if you don't go to your room I will stab you but I was scared to go to my room because I thought he wanted to kill me in the room because there is no CCTV in the room. That's why I didn't go to my room and he started stabbing me.""
Gorman was found later in Duff Street and arrested. A lock knife was recovered.
Gorman today admitted racially-aggravated attempted murder as well as causing racially-aggravated alarm to another woman in the hostel.
Det Ch Insp Paul Grainger, of Police Scotland, said: ""Gorman's violence was extreme and left the victim with significant, life-threatening injuries.
""He showed utter disregard for the victim and another woman who was with him - made all the worse given the appalling racist language used.
""Whilst this attack happened within a private property, it gained a great deal of public and media interest and I'm pleased that Gorman has been brought to justice so quickly.
""Edinburgh is a vibrant place where people of different nationalities, faiths and backgrounds live together and the support shown by the local community for the victim and his family is far more indicative of the city's inclusivity than this one isolated incident.""
Campaigners later set up an online appeal for donations ""to help Shabaz recover and rebuild his life"" with more than £12,000 raised.
Mr Ali's solicitor Aamer Anwar said a number of attacks on Syrian refugee communities were going unreported because people ""are too frightened to complain"".
Mr Anwar said: ""The family are Syrian refugees from Kobane, Northern Syria, who fled death to live in Scotland five years ago.
""Shabaz lost nine members of his family after an attack on their city by Islamic State. This racist thug who plead guilty today had no regard for thelife of Shabaz Ali, who had done nothing wrong, he was a hardworking and quiet young man trying to rebuild his life after Syria.
""Many refugee families today are suffering racist abuse in Scotland and it's up to decent people to stand up for their rights and ensure that the culprits are dealt with and that the local authorities act sensitively to support and if necessary rehouse victims.""
Kate Campbell, housing and economy convener at City of Edinburgh Council said the authority had been doing everything possible to support Mr Ali and his family during this ""terrible time"".
She added: "" I would also stress that we take the safety of everyone placed in temporary accommodation very seriously.
""The Homelessness Task Force has a meeting at the end of August where we will be looking at temporary accommodation and safety measures they have in place.""

Paul Alexander retraced the first journey of the Kindertransport rescue to mark its 80th anniversary.
He remembers nothing of the journey but found safety in the UK, he said after crossing the finishing line.
The rescue was organised after the anti-Jewish violence of Kristallnacht in Germany in November 1938.
An evacuation of mostly Jewish children to Britain saw the first arrivals in Harwich, Essex, in December 1938.
Most of the cyclists were descendants of those rescued but Mr Alexander experienced it first-hand.
He was 19 months old when his mother handed him to a British volunteer nurse, arriving in England six weeks before the outbreak of the war.
The cyclists travelled from Berlin, through Germany to the Hook of Holland where they took the Ferry to Harwich retracing the children's journey.
His father was released from Buchenwald detention camp on condition that he left the country, and his mother managed to escape to Britain days before the outbreak of war.
Mr Alexander said the three of them were reunited when he was aged four or five, but he knew he was one of the lucky ones.
He said more than half of children on the Kindertransport did not see their parents again.
""I was saved from the Holocaust, sent to a lovely country where I grew up and integrated into British life,"" he said.
""For me, this is a culmination, a vindication and a celebration of my life. Years ago I was sent as a child from Germany - then a country of persecution and hatred - to the UK where I found freedom and safety. 
""The journey that I've completed today is a victory over oppression and over everything that I was sent away from. 
""I can't think of a more poignant and meaningful thing than doing this with my son and grandson. This is my answer to Adolf Hitler.""
Mr Alexander qualified as a solicitor in London aged 24 and moved to Israel, where he still lives, in the 1970s after meeting his wife.
The cyclists are aiming to raise more than £100,000 to support World Jewish Relief's work with people living in poverty around the globe.

Growing up in Syria, Ahmad Al-Rashid was always fascinated by the England national football team.
""From an early age I had a passion about England,"" he says. ""I remember the old days with Michael Owen and David Beckham.
""I have a wonderful memory of the goal Beckham scored - the free kick he made in the last minute - it's one of the most beautiful memories I have.""
Ahmad's childhood passion for England - both as a football team and a country - led him to read English Literature at the University of Aleppo.
""I studied a lot about England,"" he said. ""The literature and the culture, and football's a big part of it.""
The 28-year-old become one of the millions of refugees who migrated to Europe following the turmoil in Syria.
He was featured in a BBC Two documentary in 2015 which captured the migration crisis from the perspective of the refugees themselves.
After being granted asylum in the UK, Ahmad was joined by his daughters who are just two and four years old. They now live in Greater London, where he works.
Football continued to play a prominent role in his life as he managed to achieve a lifelong dream - travelling to Wembley to see England play Germany in November 2017.
""The International Organisation for Migration and the Football Association invited me,"" he said. ""They provided tickets for refugees and migrants.
""I supported England from an early age so it was a dream come true, a wonderful gesture.
""And it was amazing to be welcomed. It made England feel like a home to me. My second home.""
Ahmad now wants to share his passion and pride for the Three Lions with his daughters.  
And some hardened England fans might say they got their first ""real"" taste of watching the national team play after defeat to Croatia in the World Cup semi-finals.
""After the match, one of my girls was crying,"" Ahmad said. ""She was asking, 'why did England lose?' The other one was still cheering!
""For my children, these girls, today they associate more with England than Syria.
""I feel so proud. I'm so happy to have been here with them for this World Cup. 
""What a wonderful time to be alive with this England team. The diversity of the team, the spirit they have - this is England.""

http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-44413710,refugee,8 June 2018,None,Syrian refugee comedy heading to Channel 4,"A new comedy about a Syrian refugee who enters Britain illegally, in the car boot of a family coming home from holiday, is heading for Channel 4.
Home, written by and starring W1A star Rufus Jones, tells the story of Sami as he tries to settle in the UK. 
He ends up living with new couple Peter and Katy, and her son John, after they are surprised to find their unexpected visitor when they return from France.
Jones said the show had become a ""passion project"" for him. 
He added: ""If you're only going to invite one refugee into your house this year, make it this one. Actually, make it a real one, then this one."" 
The comedy has been commissioned after a successful pilot last year. Channel 4 said the show is a ""warm, touching and deftly surprising modern sitcom"". 
Jones, who stars as entertainment format producer David Wilkes on W1A, told BBC News: ""I first thought of the idea in the middle of the refugee crisis in 2015, when we were getting all these terrible images. 
""But rather than being about Syria, it's about what a Syrian man finds when he arrives here - and I wanted to do that from the point of view of a family. It's almost like a state of the nation piece."" 
He said in the intervening years, he did wonder if the subject would become less relevant - but that ""if anything, the situation has got worse"". 
""With the Syrian refugee crisis, you have to remember that these people are us,"" he said, adding that they lived normal, lower-middle class lives before having to flee their homes. 
Jones added that he likes confronting serious subjects through comedy, saying: ""I think of comedy as another way of doing a tragedy. It's two different ways of approaching the same subject.
""On paper, it feels like a sensitive area - but I've never felt more free to write something."" 
Fiona McDermott, head of comedy at Channel 4, said: ""Home got us with its heart and conviction to tell an important story about family, strangers, identity and the fragile ties that both bind us and pull us apart. It's full of warmth, boldness and characters we hope viewers will really take to their hearts."" 
Filming of the six-part series will start in August.
Channel 4 has also announced new series Year of the Rabbit, a Victorian-era detective comedy starring Matt Berry, Freddie Fox and Susan Wokoma. And there will be a second series of Roisin Conaty's sitcom GameFace, the broadcaster announced.  
Berry said he was ""looking forward to stepping back in time to fight crime in the same significant year which bought us Van Gogh's Sunflowers, The Elephant Man and of course Jack The Ripper"". 
McDermott added: ""Imagine The Sweeney in Victorian England and you're getting close to the heady misguided machismo that runs rife in this series. ""

The tweet from the official account of the University of Reading explained that they had received negative feedback since announcing the scheme.
It added: ""To these people, we would like to say: Tough.""
The university is standing by the post, despite complaints about the language, saying it is ""proud and unapologetic to offer these scholarships"".
Some people criticised the university for the tweet, including a woman who said she was a mother of a current student.
However, others praised the university and said they were ""proud"" of the scholarship.
The plans, developed in partnership with Reading Refugee Support Group (RRSG) and Reading University Students' Union, are set to provide up to 14 university scholarships for refugees in the Reading area.
Pro Vice-Chancellor at the university, Professor Robert Van de Noort, said the scholarships are ""another practical step to welcome and integrate all people into our communities"".
He said it was ""a welcome addition to our existing range of scholarships available for a variety of students"".
Speaking about the scheme, Gaby Couchman, deputy manager at RRSG, said: ""We work with a number of refugees in Reading who have a strong desire to engage with higher education in the UK.
""These are often young and highly educated people who have had their studies interrupted due to conflict and persecution in their home country. 
""We look forward to supporting our clients into higher education and beyond.""

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-46038438,refugee,2 November 2018,By Hugo Bachega,The threat of rising anti-Semitism,"Last autumn, cards suddenly started appearing in some mail boxes of the well kept brick houses of quiet Squirrel Hill, a historic Jewish neighbourhood in the East End of Pittsburgh.
One side had a woman smiling next to a swastika. A message, ""It's not illegal to be White... yet"", and the image of a noose had been printed on the other. At the same time, stickers were found on benches in a nearby public park, saying ""White People Rock!""
Alarms were raised. It was not the first time that residents of this tight-knit community, which dates back to the 1920s, had suffered anti-Semitic abuse; yet, some were left scared. The cards eventually stopped coming, the stickers were quickly removed to never be seen again, and life continued as normal.
Isolated words of hate, many thought.
But they were not, these families would tragically find out just one year later, as similar hostility, on the rise here and across the country, resulted in a massacre in one of their most sacred places.
""All Jews must die,"" the suspected gunman reportedly said as he shot indiscriminately against worshipers gathered for their Sabbath rituals at the Tree of Life synagogue. Eleven people, aged between 54 and 97, were killed.
The deadliest anti-Semitic attack in recent US history hit the heart of this ""vibrant Jewish oasis"", as some called it. For many in Squirrel Hill, and certainly elsewhere, it did not come as a total surprise.
Anti-Semitic incidents increased 57% in the US in 2017 compared to the previous year, according to the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), with cases reported in every single state for the first time since 2010.
With alarming frequency, swastikas and messages like ""Hitler was not wrong"", ""Kill all Jews"" and ""No Jews"" have appeared on synagogues, Jewish graves and homes and school campuses, terrorising their targets.
The messages left in Squirrel Hill had the name of the Creativity Alliance, a white supremacist group, and were one of the 1,986 incidents of anti-Semitism reported by the ADL nationwide last year. A sign, they said, that their perpetrators felt emboldened enough to break the law and carry out their acts.
""Anti-Semitism is a complicated, stubborn phenomenon,"" said Jonathan Greenblatt, ADL's chief executive. ""[The cases] are disturbing and upsetting, and they demonstrate that we live in a nation where bigots still foment fear and hate.""
As to be expected, anti-Semitic speech has also increased online, where neo-Nazis, white nationalists, conspiracy theorists and others have found places to freely spread their messages in anonymity, despite notable efforts to limit them.
The alleged Tree of Life gunman, aged 46, had posted anti-Semitic content on the social network Gab, a place widely used by far-right figureheads banned from mainstream platforms. The bio on his account read ""Jews are the children of Satan"".
The dramatic rise in anti-Semitic incidents comes as incendiary rhetoric by top politicians and other prominent personalities in the last few years have deepened tensions.
It is not a coincidence, many observers say, with some even blaming President Donald Trump for stirring divisions, a claim he has repeatedly denied - reacting to the shooting, Mr Trump called for national unity, angering those who say he is part of the problem.
The tragedy in Pittsburgh was the worst nightmare of America's Jewish community which, last year, watched in shock white nationalists march in Charlottesville, Virginia, chanting ""Jews will not replace us"". 
""The political rhetoric [in the US] has headed toward the gutter. Things are being said that weren't said before,"" said David Harris, chief executive of the American Jewish Committee, an advocacy group. ""Jews aren't excluded from what has been happening.""
The anti-Semitic threat was also real from far-left and Islamist groups, he said, with a warning: if things did not change, we would all pay a heavy price.
The days before the attack had been particularly tense, and perhaps a sign of that. In Kentucky, a 51-year-old white man shot dead two African-Americans, aged 67 and 69, in a supermarket, after he tried to enter a predominantly black church in Jeffersontown. Officials are investigating it as a hate crime. 
At the same week, a 56-year-old man allegedly sent more than a dozen explosive devices to critics of President Trump, including top Democrats, CNN and Hungarian-American billionaire and philanthropist George Soros, who is Jewish and has been vilified by many on the right for being a ""globalist"".
In this perverse narrative, Mr Soros - who has been publicly criticised by Mr Trump himself - and other ""globalists"" are a nasty force who want to disrupt their predominantely white, Christian societies through unlimited immigration and, therefore, need to be defeated.
Hours before his rampage in Pittsburgh, the suspected gunman criticised refugee aid group Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society (HIAS), saying he could not ""sit by and watch my people get slaughtered"". He now faces hate crime charges which could lead to a death sentence.
Tree of Life Rabbi Jeffrey Myers was at the synagogue when the attack happened and, this week, welcomed Mr Trump to Squirrel Hill, despite protests. Mr Trump was joined by First Lady Melania, his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who is Jewish, and daughter Ivanka, who converted to Judaism when she married him.
Some of the demonstrators carried placards saying ""Make America Kind Again,"" a play with the president's slogan.
""[But] this is not about politics. Hate doesn't know political party, religion, colour, persuasion or anything,"" said Mr Myers, who led the funerals of some of his own friends, shot dead at the synagogue.
""We do need to have strong leadership from all our elected leaders, not any one person, all of them from all political parties. We need to stop the hate."" 
In the last decades, American Jews watched their fellows being targeted in Europe and thought they were relatively safe. Brutal attacks have taken place in France, which has the Continent's largest Jewish community, Germany and beyond.
In the UK, the Labour Party has been embroiled in a long-running row over claims of anti-Semitism.
""I'm from Europe, it's much more common everywhere. For Americans, it's shocking because it's unusual,"" said 30-year-old Nathan Rittri, who lived a few houses from Tree of Life, as he walked with his wife and two young children to light candles in front of the synagogue on the morning after the shooting.
""It's something that is part of the day-to-day lives in other countries.""
In some European cities, Jewish buildings are secured by armed officers and followers have adopted precautions, such as avoiding displaying religious symbols. (Mr Trump said the outcome in Pittsburgh would have been different if there were armed guards outside the congregation.)
It was still early to say if any measures would be taken in this country, and residents in Squirrel Hill were determined that nothing would change. For some others, though, change has already happened.
""There was a kind of wishful thinking here that we were somehow immune,"" said Mr Harris.
""Pittsburgh, in a way, destroyed whatever innocence was left in American Jews.""

http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/in-pictures-44534217,refugee,20 June 2018,None,Syria war: Refugee women heading households in Jordan,"The Syrian crisis has had a huge impact on its neighbour Jordan, which hosts a large number of people from across the border.
While there is often a focus on the country's refugee camps, many Syrians live in urban areas. Around a third of refugee households are headed by women, who are increasingly looking for work to support their families and cope with rising prices, growing debts and crippling poverty. 
With growing unemployment and a struggling economy, on top of barriers to women working that can hinder their efforts, they and their Jordanian counterparts face an uphill struggle to get by. Daily life often involves choosing between essentials like buying food or gas bottles, funding bus fares to school, paying the rent or going to the doctor.
For its annual World Refugee Day, on 20 June, the UN marks the ""courage and perseverance"" of the tens of millions who have been forced to flee their homes and asks the public to stand by the refugees.
A framed photo of her late husband hangs high on the wall above Mariam Agag, as she sits on the floor of her rented home in Irbid, northern Jordan.
A Syrian refugee who fled in 2012 and was widowed four years later, Mariam is now raising six daughters alone.
The girls, aged six to 14, all have ambitions to be medics or teachers. But Mariam is frightened of the future, wondering how to keep them safe and fund the education they want.
""With no guy to protect us, I am always watching. I'm scared when they go to school because someone might harass them. I'm scared I won't able to finance them to go to university.""
After receiving an unexpected 3,000JD (£3,200) bill for their daughter Sara's diabetes care in 2016, they were in shock: ""My husband was sitting there just trying to understand what was going on. Four days later he died of a stroke.""
The family's fragile situation worsened after this death. She has done some temporary jobs and they receive UN food vouchers, but Mariam often sells some of them to pay for other things. 
""Sometimes we can't even afford food. Last week I sold two blankets and a heater just to support ourselves. Healthcare prices are really high - when my daughters get sick I can't afford to go to the doctor.""
Like many refugees, she seeks charity funding for medical treatments, like the diabetes medicines Sara needs.
Salwa Naqarash (pictured below) is also raising her two daughters solo. Soon after the family fled to Jordan in 2013, her husband abandoned them and returned to Syria to marry a second wife. She lives with her sister Salam, who is divorced, and her two children in Naemiah village, Irbid. 
""I need to find a job, with no husband to help me. The pressure on us sometimes builds up, with so much stress inside me I just collapse - I am done with everything.""
Their father and two of their brothers were killed in the war, and the rest of the family is stuck in Syria. There's no one to hold them tight and say 'keep going', she says.
Like Mariam, Salwa and Salam have been involved in a recent project, managed by the charity Action Against Hunger and funded by German development agency GIZ, that gave temporary contracts to refugees and local Jordanians to collect street refuse for wages.
Most used the money to pay for medical treatment or settle debts, but the sisters managed to invest some in a sewing machine, and hope to develop their small business making curtains and furniture covers for locals.
""I wish we could expand. If I had the money I would make business cards or a sign for outside,"" she says.
The sisters have also tried to teach themselves DIY because they can't pay anyone to help in the house. 
""If we need to fix the electricity we say 'why don't we do it ourselves'? Life is tough, so you have to be tougher than life.""
The waste collection project provided work permits for the refugees and also hired local Jordanians, who are feeling the strain from the crisis next door.
Action Against Hunger programme manager Sajeda Saqallah says they encounter many women supporting their families alone. As well as pushing back against some resistance to women working, they also had to overcome a ""shame culture"" around picking up litter in public streets.
""It reflects the fragility of their economic situation when the women leave their houses and work outside,"" Saqallah said.
""People can talk but I don't care. I just wanted some income,"" says 49-year-old Jordanian Hanan Khateeb, a widow with six children who took part in the project.
""Why can't a woman work? Yes a lot of people say that, but this is nonsense - I am very proud of myself.""
""My husband's brothers never check on me. If family doesn't care, why can't I earn my own money?""
Fellow worker Amnah Turkmani's husband was killed in Syria. She gets 20JD (£21) a month for each of her five children from UNICEF, ""but it's not enough"".
Like all refugees, she doesn't have an automatic right to work in Jordan, so often does 'irregular' jobs.  ""Sometimes I borrow money or food from the neighbours, or I do seasonal work like harvesting olives. I'm always looking for work.""
Despite the challenges the women thrived on the waste collection work and the chance to socialise, added Saqallah. 
After the contracts ended, one group went on to form an upcycling project, which turns old paper and plastic into handbags and other household items, which they plan to sell.
Working together and learning new skills improved their confidence and helped the two communities become more cohesive. 
""We saw them become more inter-connected to each other, the Syrians' confidence increased and they enjoyed living in their neighbourhood more,"" says Saqallah. 
""Maybe they'd been afraid or worried about getting involved with Jordanians - now they have established good friendships.""
UNHCR's annual Global Trends report, released for World Refugee Day, shows a new high of 68.5m people were displaced from their homes by the end of 2017 - one in every 110 people in the world.

http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-44519342,refugee,20 June 2018,By Alison Wilkins,Is Sara a 'refugee' or a 'would-be surgeon'?,"At the age of just 11, Sara's plans for the future are already clear.
""I will become a surgeon,"" she says firmly.
It's a noble ambition, shared by youngsters the world over.
But unlike many of her peers, Sara has more hurdles to overcome to achieve her goal.
Because Sara, along with her parents and three little brothers, Ali, Deeb and Hadi, currently lives in a two-room tent in an informal settlement in the Zahle District in the Beqaa Valley, Lebanon.
They are refugees from Syria.
The youngster is one of millions of children around the world who are currently displaced due to conflict, violence and war - and whose plight is highlighted on World Refugee Day.
These young people have often been dubbed the ""lost generation"" - at risk of missing out on the basic entitlements of a happy, peaceful childhood - such as an education.
Sara could be considered one of the lucky ones - she is attending primary school, and talks about her school experiences with pride.
With the aid of an interpreter, Sara explains how she takes a bus each day to an elementary school in Taalabaya, Beqaa Valley.
She has classes in Arabic, English, maths, science, geography, sports and arts.
School is enjoyable; her favourite things she says, are ""the school and teachers, friends and classes"".
And her favourite subject is English ""because I love the teacher"".
Outside of school, she helps at home, and plays with her brothers.
While adulthood is still some years away, Sara's eye is on her future career.
""I will become a surgeon, a doctor, in the future,"" she says, her reason simply ""because they take care of people.""
The youngster says she knows she will have to study hard, and believes her school is helping her on the path to success - science is a ""good subject"" for her, she says.
Her homework is done in the main room of the family's tent, built by her father Ghassan, for $1,000 at $100 a month.
It has been the family's home for the last three years.
Sara and her family moved to Lebanon five years ago, after their home in Syria was attacked and partially collapsed, leaving neighbours fearing they had died in the blast.
By this point, they had already been displaced several times due to the conflict, and Sara was around six years old when the family were forced to leave the country.
In their homeland, Ghassan was a tailor - he now takes on any kind of work to provide for his family. 
His wife, and Sara's mother, Fatima, was a kindergarten teacher in Syria, but differences in the curriculum between the two countries means she is not currently working.
The youngster says she misses her family and house in Syria, and that in Lebanon they live a very ""different life"".
She has hopes that the family will be able to live somewhere else, saying: ""The tent is very hot in summer and very cold in winter.""
Asked where she would like to live in the future, she has a very simple wish: ""A place there is no violence. In a safe place.""
Sara's education has been provided by a partnership between the UN agency, UNRWA, which works with Palestinian refugees, and the Education Above All Foundation (EAA).
The partnership is providing primary education to out-of-school Palestinian refugee children who have had to leave Syrian schools due to the conflict.
By working together, they have reached more than 66,000 primary-level children across Lebanon, Jordan and Syria.
The Foundation itself has committed to providing education for more than 10 million children who do not have access to good quality schooling, with 6.6 million youngsters already enrolled.
Dr Mary Joy Pigozzi, executive director of Educate A Child, one of EAA's programmes, says that Sara's story ""illustrates the fundamental importance of education in transforming the lives of children who have been displaced"". 
""Every child should have the opportunity to enjoy school in the way Sara does, regardless of their difficult circumstances,"" she says. 
She adds: ""As a global community we have a responsibility to reach every single out of school child"".

He was joined by First Lady Melania Trump, his daughter and son-in-law at the Tree of Life temple in Pittsburgh.
Hundreds of protesters gathered on the street chanting slogans against the president.
The visit came as mourners attended the first funerals for victims of the massacre.
The Trumps were greeted on Tuesday by Rabbi Jeffrey Myers, who led them inside the temple, where the worst anti-Semitic attack in US history unfolded on Saturday. 
At a memorial outside, Mrs Trump placed a flower and the president laid a small stone on a marker for each of the victims.
Mr Trump was joined by his son-in-law Jared Kushner, who is Jewish, and his daughter Ivanka, who converted to Judaism when she married Mr Kushner. Both are White House advisers.
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who is Jewish, also joined the president.
Before his visit, the president condemned anti-Semitism. The alleged gunman was not a Trump supporter.
Critics accuse Mr Trump of fomenting a surge in white nationalist and neo-Nazi activity through divisive rhetoric which has seen him criticise immigrants and Muslims in particular.
Some Jewish figures and Pittsburgh's Democratic Mayor Bill Peduto opposed the presidential visit.
More than 70,000 people signed an open letter from Pittsburgh-based Jewish leaders saying that President Trump was ""not welcome"" in the city unless he ""fully denounces white nationalism"".
The top four Republican and Democratic congressional leaders declined a White House invitation to join Mr Trump in Pennsylvania.
The White House has rejected any blame over the attack.
Members of Pittsburgh's Jewish community were among about 2,000 demonstrators who held a protest, according to Reuters news agency.
As the president was driven through Pittsburgh, some bystanders made obscene gestures to his motorcade and thumbs-down gestures, reports AP news agency.
As Mr Trump arrived at the synagogue, demonstrators chanted ""President Hate, leave our state"" and ""Words have meaning"".
They held signs with such slogans as ""We build bridges not walls""; ""Trump, Renounce White Nationalism Now""; and ""Trump's lies kill"".
During the presidential visit, one protester holding a baby was seen by reporters calling out: ""We didn't invite you here.""
Earlier on Tuesday, mourners paid their respects to four victims of the massacre.
Brothers David and Cecil Rosenthal, who were aged 54 and 59, were among the first to be buried. They were the youngest victims of the shooting.
During a packed prayer service for the siblings, Rabbi Myers said: ""They could illustrate a dictionary definition for 'pure souls'.""
Daniel Stein, 71, and Jerry Rabinowitz, 66, were also laid to rest. 
Mr Rabinowitz was a doctor, known for his work with gay men diagnosed with HIV. On Saturday, he was shot and killed after he rushed to help the wounded, his nephew Avishai Ostrin said in an emotional Facebook post.
Support for the community has been pouring in from across the country.
A GoFundMe page created by an Iranian refugee studying in Washington DC, who has no connection to the Pittsburgh community, has already accumulated $900,000 (£700,000) to help rebuild the synagogue and support victims' families.
Another fund set up by Muslim-American groups to help pay for funeral costs has raised $200,000.
Robert Bowers, 46, is now in the custody of US marshals and faces 29 criminal charges. 
He was discharged from hospital on Monday after being treated for multiple gunshot wounds.
During his first court appearance on Monday, Bowers waived his detention hearing and requested a public defender, US media reported.
A further hearing has been scheduled for 1 November.

President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump visited Pittsburgh to pay their respects amid a large protest by hundreds of people.
Critics said the president's trip drew attention away from the funerals.
As President Trump arrived, demonstrators chanted: ""President hate, leave our state.""
""Trump, Renounce White Nationalism Now,"" read one sign. Another said: ""Trump's lies kill.""
During the president's visit to the synagogue one protester holding a baby was seen by reporters calling to Mr Trump's motorcade: ""We didn't invite you here.""
Mr Trump was accompanied on by his son-in-law and adviser Jared Kushner, who is Jewish, and Mr Kushner's wife, Ivanka Trump, a convert to Judaism.
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who is also a Jew, joined the president, too.
Some Jewish figures and Pittsburgh's Democratic mayor Bill Peduto have opposed the presidential visit.
The 11 worshippers were shot and killed at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in what is thought to be the worst anti-Semitic attack in US history. 
Six other people were injured.
Lines of mourners stretched for several blocks at the public services on Tuesday.
Brothers David and Cecil Rosenthal, who were aged 54 and 59, were among the first to be buried. They were the youngest victims of the shooting.
During a prayer service for the brothers, Rabbi Myers reportedly told the packed service: ""They could illustrate a dictionary definition for 'pure souls.'""
Jerry Rabinowitz, 66, was also buried on Tuesday. He was a doctor in the Squirrel Hill community, particularly known for his work with gay men diagnosed with HIV.
On Saturday, he was shot and killed after he rushed to help the wounded, his nephew Avishai Ostrin said in an emotional Facebook post.
""When he heard shots he ran outside to try and see if anyone was hurt and needed a doctor,"" he wrote. ""That was Uncle Jerry, that's just what he did.""
Daniel Stein, 71, was also buried in a private service on Tuesday.
As the Pittsburgh Jewish community plans for the victims' funerals, which are scheduled all week, support has been pouring in from across the country.
A GoFundMe fundraiser created by an Iranian refugee studying in Washington DC, who has no connection to the Pittsburgh community, has already received over $839,000 (£658,000) to help rebuild the synagogue and support victims' families.
Another fund set up by Muslim-American groups to help pay for funeral costs has raised over $195,000.
The Jewish Federation of Greater Pittsburgh said people had donated over $205,000, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reported.
More than 70,000 people signed an open letter from Pittsburgh-based Jewish leaders saying that President Trump was ""not welcome"" in the city unless he ""fully denounces white nationalism"".
The White House has rejected any blame over the attack.
US Vice-President Mike Pence also provoked controversy after a cleric whose views are shunned by mainstream Jews led prayers for victims at a Republican rally on Monday.
Known as Messianic Jews, the movement is shunned by mainstream Judaism.
Social media users were angered by the presence of a figure whose movement is viewed by mainstream Judaism as a branch of evangelical Christianity.

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-46073979,refugee,2 November 2018,By Alistair Coleman,Fake Soros scares bid to draw US voters ahead of mid-terms,"Disinformation about George Soros and untrue stories detailing his alleged connection to the migrant caravan in Mexico are making headway among American voters on social media.
Right-wing media organisations have portrayed the Hungarian-American billionaire as a leftist bogeyman using his money to derail the US political system, usually through unproven rumours that his largesse not only funds NGOs and campaign groups but also the migrants in Mexico. 
It's a narrative pushed by President Trump himself, who claimed on Twitter that women protesting the Justice Kavanaugh confirmation hearing were ""paid for by Soros and others"". He's also made the migrant caravan and immigration issues central part of his mid-term election push.
Both ""real"" social media users and what appear to be bot accounts have been spreading disinformation aimed at Mr Soros and his Jewish background, even after the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting which left 11 worshippers dead. 
Many Twitter users have been enthusiastic in following the right-wing narrative that George Soros is deeply involved in funding liberal causes, from paying people to protest against Brett Kavanaugh, to handing out cash to encourage migrants in the south of Mexico to move toward the American border.
Rumours that Mr Soros has been funding migrant caravans go back months, with one item on right-wing website One News Now dated 1 May bluntly proclaiming that ""Leftist billionaire George Soros is funding the well-organised anti-Trump migrant caravan invasion from Central America"" which is ""attacking the US border"" as part of a ""refugee invasion"".
It takes as its source, other right-wing websites, WorldNetDaily and CNS News.
Among the slurs against the financier is the continued spreading of the discredited story that he was a member of the Nazi SS. 
One Twitter user tweeted a meme last week which repeated the accusation, receiving more that 6,000 retweets before it was deleted following a strong rebuke from the Auschwitz Memorial account.
""This is a lie. The man in the picture is Oskar Gröning, a member of the SS garrison of the Auschwitz concentration and extermination camp,"" the site commemorating victims of the Nazi genocide said.
But the strength of polarised opinion around the meme, still available on Twitter shows that the ""alternative facts"" broadcast both in right-wing media and on social platforms are being believed and shared by many users ahead of the mid-terms. 
Viewed over 2.4m times on Facebook, for example, is a video posted in April by former Fox News presenter Glenn Beck titled ""George Soros is funding the migrant 'caravans' to the US"". The video has been re-purposed by right-wing Twitter users to justify their support for President Trump sending troops to defend the southern US border. 
American press reports say that the slow-moving caravan, numbering around 7,000 people, is still more than 1,000 miles away from the US border, but Twitter users, such as @MrFreddyColon who has over 64,000 followers, claim that the number could be as high as 50,000 before the caravan reaches the US. 
This echoes stories seen on right-wing US TV networks, which describe the immigrant group as ""diseased"", ""violent"", or a likely cover for terrorists and criminals. 
With the same narrative being pushed by the US president , it's hardly surprising that there is no shortage of people posting anti-immigrant opinions on social media. 
Disinformation on George Soros is also present on Facebook, with groups such as ""George Soros Exposed"" and ""Arrest George Soros"" becoming more active in the weeks before the elections.
The latter group entertained a rumour in September - spread by QAnon activists - that Mr Soros may already have been arrested.
George Soros Exposed posted a meme calling him ""the most evil man on this planet"" along with a list of his alleged ""crimes"".
These groups tend to share memes already posted on other conservative pages spreading an extreme right-wing agenda, along with the predictable claims that the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting were a ""false flag"" operation set up to discredit the right.
While genuine social media users from all parts of the US political spectrum post their opinions, there are also networks of accounts hoping to skew the conversation in their preferred direction.
Among the accounts identified by the BBC, @AnnaApp91838450 displayed typical partially-moderated bot behaviour ""conversing"" with other very similar accounts to look more ""human"" to the casual observer. 
With nearly 80,000 followers, and TwitterAudit suggesting most are genuine users, the account seems to have gained a large follower base through its unrealistically high number of follows - over 50,000, and at least partial human curation with memes specific to the account. 
It also shares large numbers of pro-Trump, pro-GOP and pro-right wing posts with other, similar accounts which feature typically patriotic names (George Washington's Axe - now suspended, Vet With A Cause, Deplorable Doug) and large follow-to-follower ratios. 
But what sets them apart from regular Twitter users is the sheer volume of posts. These accounts post hundreds of times daily, both their own content mixed with retweets from conservative accounts, including Donald Trump, his family, and conservative news outlets such as Breitbart and Gateway Pundit.
Posts appear on these accounts every few minutes, heavy with hashtags and emojis, and almost always with an accompanying meme, animated gif or photograph. It could be easy to surmise that it is a full-time job for the person or algorithm operating any given account.
The huge number of hashtags, sometimes several in each post (#MAGA, #VoteRedToSaveAmerica, #StopTheCaravan are all seen frequently), suggests an attempt to hijack search results - and hence the conversation through volume of traffic. 
Curated content seems to be in broken English, suggesting it is not the user's first language, and basic errors (""George Soro's"" with an apostrophe) suggests the output is based more on quantity rather than quality. 
They've also remained active virtually continuously since they emerged in the months before the 2016 election when the emphasis was on #LockHerUp, #DrainTheSwamp and #EvilHilary. 
But with immigration and nationalism being prominent in the Republican campaign, the wave of extremist tweets continues, along with their claims that Mr Soros is the shadowy hand planning the demise of the United States.

Paul Alexander will retrace the first journey of the Kindertransport rescue for the 80th anniversary.
The rescue was organised after the anti-Jewish violence of Kristallnacht in Germany in November 1938.
An evacuation of mostly Jewish children to Britain saw the first arrivals in Harwich, Essex, in December 1938.
The effort continued until war broke out nine months later.
Most of the cyclists will be descendants of people rescued by the Kindertransport, but Mr Alexander experienced it firsthand.
He was 19 months old when his mother handed him to a British volunteer nurse, arriving in England six weeks before the outbreak of the war.
Mr Alexander said he had no recollection of the journey, and his first memories were of being in the London Underground during bombing. 
His father was released from Buchenwald detention camp on condition that he left the country, and his mother managed to escape to Britain days before the outbreak of war.
Mr Alexander said the three of them were reunited when he was aged four or five, but he knew he was one of the lucky ones.
He said more than half of children on the Kindertransport did not see their parents again.
""I was saved from the Holocaust, sent to a lovely country where I grew up integrated into British life and I'm a lucky guy,"" he said.
Mr Alexander qualified as a solicitor in London aged 24 and moved to Israel, where he still lives, in the 1970s after meeting his wife.
On Sunday a group of 42 cyclists will retrace the route of the first journey from Berlin and the Hook of Holland, taking a ferry to Harwich before arriving at London Liverpool Street on 22 June.
The cyclists are aiming to raise more than £100,000 to support World Jewish Relief's work with people living in poverty around the globe.

A New Beginning, at the Protein Studios in London, displays work by 10 artists commissioned for the UK refugee charity Breaking Barriers.
The striking portraits of refugees from different corners of the world have been paired with interviews by New Humanist journalist Samira Shackle.
Here are some of the portraits and stories from the exhibition curated by Rebecca McClelland.
Beilqes Alzawm says ""all my life I have been a fighter"". Originally from Yemen, Beilqes was forced into a marriage at the age of 16.
She eventually escaped with her son and lived with her parents whilst she studied political science.
Facing sexism throughout her career in Yemen, Beilqes worked hard to secure a prestigious job in human rights, which gave her the opportunity to work in London in 2015.
Then a war started in Yemen and it became too dangerous to return. ""I lost everything because of this stupid war,"" she says ""I had to start from scratch.""
Beilqes volunteered with the British Red Cross as an Arabic interpreter and case worker, but she has struggled to find work in her field of expertise in the UK because of her confidence in her standard of English.
Despite this, she is hopeful she will get back on her career path and promote human rights. She currently has an administrative job with Allen & Overy law firm.
""People always ask me if I find it difficult because this is a new country for me. What are you talking about? To lose your life is the big struggle, to wake up every day and open your eyes to bombing and shells, to be without food and sleep.
""I am living in the most beautiful, fashionable city in the world. Yes, I have struggled to find a job and to learn English, but I won't die. My son is here with me. He is building a life and a future. Why should I worry?
""I am worried about one thing only - my family in Yemen.""
Ahmed Osman, originally from Egypt, became a refugee in the UK after falling on extremely hard times with his international fruit-selling business.
Ahmed had a thriving business exporting fruit across Europe from Egypt, with more than 250 people working for him.
He says that problems arose when a UK-based client did not pay him for a shipment worth £250,000. He could not then pay an Egyptian supplier and received death threats and rumours were spread that he was a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, a banned organisation in Egypt, which he denies.
Ahmed travelled to the UK to try to get back the money owed to him through the court system, but he quickly ran out of money because of legal costs.
His first request for asylum was refused and Ahmed became homeless. His mental health deteriorated and he tried to take his own life in a park. Strangers saved him, he was then helped by the police and received psychiatric support from a hospital and was referred to a shelter.
Ahmed says: ""Sometimes I can't believe that life can change so quickly.
""I take photographs and videos on my phone, and I write things down, so that I don't forget all the things that have happened to me.""
When Ahmed finally received his refugee status, he was then able to work and attend English courses. He has started to sell fruit and sugarcane, sent to him from Egypt, to UK wholesalers.
His legal case regarding money which he says he is owed is going to be heard at the Royal Courts of Justice.
During her childhood, Ozlem Erden experienced prejudice in Turkey after her family moved from south-eastern Turkey, the Kurdish region, to an area where most people were Turkish.
""I played with other kids, but their parents kept their distance, as if we had a contagious disease,"" Ozlem says. ""I remember being called names - 'Kurdish with a tail' - when I was out with my mother.
""I wanted to die with embarrassment.""
When she was a teenager, Ozlem started to take part in Kurdish political activities, such as distributing leaflets and joining the first Kurdish folkloric dance group. Police raided her house and she was imprisoned at the age of 14 for her activities.
She was released after nine months, pending the ongoing case and in 1994 was sentenced to prison for more than eight years.
Ozlem decided to flee her home city to escape jail, she assumed a different identity and cut herself off from her family. She worked for five years and then left Turkey permanently and arrived in the UK in 1999 with her sister, who was also fleeing the Turkish government.
Having reached safety, Ozlem started to process her traumatic early life and fell into a severe depression.
In 2000, she finally received her status and quickly got a job stacking shelves in a supermarket. Ozlem studied and got involved with Kurdish and Turkish human rights organisations and advocated for Kurdish women's rights at the UN.
Ozlem got married and earned a law degree and a masters in international finance and economics. She aims to become a qualified solicitor in commercial law.
""Maybe one day I'll get involved in Kurdish politics, if there is a need.""
Bada Yusuf left Egypt after realising ""if I wanted to be who I am, my life in Egypt couldn't continue"".
He says: ""I visited the UK in November 2016, and planned to go back to Cairo afterwards. But in my first week I asked myself: why are you going back, unless you want to die? I took the decision suddenly and applied for asylum, without thinking twice.
""If you feel you are dying anyway, the consequences don't matter.""
Bada says he came to the UK longing for human connection but quickly realised it was not going to be as easy as he hoped, finding English people much more reserved than Egyptian people, with a lot of guards and barriers.
""For the first six months or so, I was very depressed and cried all the time.
""My mum told me not to give up and reminded me how restricted I was in Cairo. She is always the one who keeps me going.""
Since then, Bada has studied for a masters in finance at Birkbeck University and has been helped to find an internship at a creative research agency.
When volunteering at Pride's pop-up shop last year, Bada met a group of Arabs involved in the LGBT community and has made many new friends.
""The only thing I ever wanted from my life was to be in peace - not even to be happy, just to be content. Even now that I don't have restrictions outside, I have restrictions inside myself.
""In Egypt, I had reached the point where it was hard for me to go to the supermarket. Now I can walk the streets.
""Even when circumstances in my life are hard, I keep thinking: you have to be thankful.""
As a young man, Mohsen Raiesi loved to play music, dance and sing in Iran. After problems with police and the government he decided to move to London when he was 25.
However, the Home Office did not believe he had endured difficulties in Iran and he waited six years to receive asylum status. He did not have a passport and could not open a bank account.
""There are lots of people like this in London,"" he says ""They have no papers, they have no support.""
Mohsen developed a sleep disorder during Iran's war with Iraq, when he was three years old. He came from an island very close to Iraq, and his town was completely destroyed.
Since then, he has had nightmares every day and received medical support for the problem and also for depression.
While living alone in London, Mohsen discovered a love of cooking.
""It took time for me to learn how to do Persian dishes properly, especially the way my mum cooks it. You have to be so particular, so specific.
""I learned step-by-step, and now I can make so many special dishes. After such a long time struggling, I realised I could find happiness in making food.""
Mohsen married his Iranian wife in 2015 and she then was finally able to join him in the UK in 2018. He currently works as a manager in a coffee shop but wants to create a pop-up restaurant with his wife, selling Persian dishes.
""I always believe that the impossible is possible. People told me I wouldn't get married, and then that I wouldn't be able to bring my wife here. But I did it.
""You must never give up. Trust people, and be strong, and work hard.""

The 35-year-old fled Damascus with her family in 2012. She now lives in the Domiz Camp in Northern Iraq, where roses, lemon trees and marigolds have sprung up amid the concrete and dust.
""Creating a garden was a way for us to heal and remind us of home,"" she says.
Alfonso Montiel of the Lemon Tree Trust has sat down in many of the tiny green spaces at the camp.
""You'll see in some cases it's full of roses,"" he says. ""The first question you ask yourself is, why not food?""
Flowers, says Montiel, give a sense of the passage of time. ""It gives them a sense of hope. It gives a sense of control of their environment."" 
The Lemon Tree Trust has been working in the refugee camps of Northern Iraq for the past three years, running garden competitions to encourage residents to create gardens, and providing seeds and plants. 
Domiz, one of the largest camps in Kurdistan, is home to 30,000 refugees, most of them from Syria.
""The Syrians - one of the things they pack when they leave is seeds,"" says Montiel. ""They want seeds from their own plants, from their own spaces, from their own families.""
Gardeners in the camp grow seeds and plants brought to them from Syria by brothers, uncles and cousins. The community has come together to build raised beds, which are planted with vegetables and flowers. 
More recently, residents of the camp have helped choose plants and flowers for the Lemon Tree Trust's first refugee-inspired garden at the RHS Chelsea Flower Show. Sami, who has a PhD in botany, played a big role.
""He walked from Syria for ten days holding both of his boys, one on each hand, into the camp,"" says Montiel. ""He was a principal collaborator in choosing the plants with Tom [designer Tom Massey] and thinking about the design. This is truly a garden inspired and developed with the help of the refugees themselves.""
The garden has already proved an inspiration for Sue Biggs, the director general of the Royal Horticultural Society. When she heard about plans for the garden, she was reminded of a chapter in history 100 years ago when the RHS sent seeds to British citizens who were prisoners of war in the Ruheleben internment camp in Germany, to help them survive the hardships.
""Just as we had done to Germany in 1918 so we did again in 2018 to Kurdistan, to the Domiz Camp in Iraq,"" she says. 
""It was uncanny really, two groups of people, 100 years apart, one in Germany, one in Iraq, and really the same basic human desire to nurture and to grow something, even in terrible circumstances. 
The RHS sent 2,000 packets of seeds out to Domiz last month, including vegetables such as peppers and cucumbers, and flowers such as marigolds and sunflowers.
When the RHS searched their London Lindley Library for the original letters and photographs from the 1918 seed lift they found the refugees in Iraq had asked for a nearly identical selection. 
""From one dry, dusty seed, there is a life that can flourish,"" says Sue Biggs. 
""At the end they can end up eating healthy food or just being able to brighten their surroundings and feel like human beings.""
The Lemon Tree Trust's garden is on display at the RHS Chelsea Flower Show.

Magid Magid, is the city's first Somali mayor, first Green Party mayor, and, at 28, the youngest mayor.
He came to Sheffield aged five after six months in an Ethiopian refugee camp with his mother and five siblings who left Somalia ""to find a better life"".
""Just me being in the post brings an element of difference to the role,"" he said.

Mr Magid, who was a contestant on Channel 4's reality show Hunted, added: ""I hope it will help engage those that have not previously engaged before.""
He was sworn into his new role at the annual mayor-making ceremony, where the Imperial March from Star Wars was played followed by the Superman theme tune, as reported by the Sheffield Star.
But his story is not a case of a privileged upbringing helping to open doors but of determination, ambition - and a love of climbing mountains.
Born in Burao in war-torn northern Somalia, Mr Magid said he did not remember much of his childhood and had never returned to his country of birth.
""I remember just being happy, playing around as you do as a kid, but in reality it was a completely different story,"" he said.
His family set up home in Sheffield's Burngreave area.
He said life was difficult when he and his family arrived, trying to learn the language and adapt to a new way of life.
His mother worked as a cleaner to look after her children, with Magid and his siblings acting as translators.
He went to Fir Vale School where he said he was ""just like your average child"".
By the time he was 17 he said his ""massive fascination with mountains"" had emerged.
""I really wanted to climb the seven summits, so I worked 12-hour shifts every day for nine weeks and paid to go on a mountaineering course in the Swiss Alps.
""When I was 19 I wanted to climb Kilimanjaro, so I packed what I needed, went to the local town and found someone to climb it with me.
""I guess that's how I like to do things. I like to look for solutions to barriers, and being courageous and brave is part of being able to do that.""
From mountain tops to the bottoms of the ocean, Magid went on to study aquatic zoology at the University of Hull.
""I just really wanted to go to university,"" he said.
""You are taking yourself out of your comfort zone and where else would you meet so many people from different parts of the world and experience such different things in one place. That's what I wanted.""
He said he developed an interest in politics while at university and was elected as president of the students' union.
He admits he was not ""politically savvy"" adding he ""had no idea between the left and the right but I knew I cared about certain issues"".
In 2014 he delved further into politics, becoming a regular viewer of the BBC's Daily Politics show, ""I used to think, 'who actually watched this?'"" he said, ""but there I was"".
Despite friends and family largely supporting Labour, he said he found the Green Party better represented his views and in 2016 he was elected as Green councillor for Broomhill and Sharrow Vale.

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-23709337,refugee,29 October 2018,None,Angela Merkel: Germany's shrewd political survivor,"She cultivated the image of a prudent and pragmatic leader and was once dubbed the Queen of Germany and even the Empress of Europe.
Now, Angela Merkel has announced she will not contest the leadership of her own party, and that this term as chancellor - her fourth - will also be her last.
What seemed a given - Mrs Merkel as the leader of Europe's largest economy - is now temporary until her term runs out in 2021. 
Her crown first began to slip as the backlash sparked by her open-door refugee policy helped fuel the country's far right and led to her party's worst electoral performance in almost 70 years in 2017.
Mrs Merkel has said that she has no plans for future political office - something she has held in one form or another since German reunification, seeing off challenge after challenge until now.
Born in Hamburg on 17 July 1954, Angela Kasner was only a couple of months old when her father, a Lutheran pastor, was given a parish in a small town in East Germany. 
She grew up in a rural area outside Berlin in the Communist east, and earned a doctorate in physics, later working as a chemist at a scientific academy in East Berlin. She married fellow student Ulrich Merkel in 1977 but divorced four years later.
By 1989 she had become involved in the East's burgeoning democracy movement and, after the Berlin Wall came down, she got a job as East German government spokeswoman following the first democratic elections.
Two months before Germany's reunification in 1990, she joined the centre-right Christian Democrats (CDU) and the following year took the job of minister for women and youth under Chancellor Helmut Kohl. 
When Mr Kohl was caught in a slush fund scandal, she called for his resignation in 1999, and in 2000 was chosen to lead the CDU.
She became Germany's first female chancellor in 2005.
Early in her political career, she was seen as uncharismatic, provincial and rather dowdy, and tried to shake off that image with a series of bright, colourful outfits and a new hairstyle.
She married chemistry professor Joachim Sauer in 1998.
Mrs Merkel's first government was an uneasy ""grand coalition"" with the centre-left Social Democrats (SPD). 
Then, between 2009 and 2013, she governed with the pro-business Free Democrats (FDP).
As Europe's financial crisis bit, she became the symbol of fiscal austerity, prescribing sweeping budget cuts and tight supervision as the cure for southern Europe's chronic debts. 
Critics say her initial reluctance to resort to bailouts weakened the eurozone's credibility but as Germany became the biggest paymaster for the eurozone bailouts, so Mrs Merkel too became the driving force behind the EU's efforts to restore confidence in the euro.  
Protesters in Greece and Spain blamed Germany for imposing fiscal austerity, occasionally likening Mrs Merkel to Hitler.
Germany's resilience, low unemployment and healthy exports for years boosted her popularity at home, where she was widely seen as a safe pair of hands in tough times.
In 2013, her FDP coalition partner failed to win a single seat, leading Mrs Merkel to return to a coalition with the SPD.
Her attitude to austerity eventually softened. In a BBC interview in June 2013, she argued that Europe needed more labour mobility to tackle unemployment, with more young people seeking jobs in other EU countries.
Mrs Merkel faced her biggest challenge as chancellor when migrants and refugees began heading in large numbers for Europe's most successful economy. 
As late as July 2015, the chancellor was seen by some as insensitive when she tried to comfort a girl who had been waiting for years for residence in Germany.
But as the number of new arrivals grew, she took the lead in opening Germany's borders, temporarily suspending an EU rule requiring asylum seekers to register in the first member state they entered.
She was feted at the United Nations for her humanitarian stance and Time magazine lionised her as its person of the year and de facto leader of the European Union.
The message that ""we will manage it"" - ""wir schaffen das"" - was taken on board by millions of Germans.
But not everyone was happy with the open-door policy and the far-right, populist Alternative for Germany (AfD) was spearheading opposition to it. 
What began as anti-Islam marches in the eastern cities of Leipzig and Dresden was becoming mainstream.
Sexual assaults by migrants on New Year revellers in Cologne and then Islamist attacks in Germany during the summer all dented the chancellor's popularity.
Mrs Merkel has stopped short of admitting making a mistake but has said ""if I could, I would turn back the clock many years"" to prepare Germany better for the influx of arrivals. 
The biggest sign that things were changing was yet to come. In the September 2017 general election, Mrs Merkel's CDU had its worst result since 1949, while the SPD registered its worst ever showing.
The AfD became the third biggest force in the Bundestag.
The election put Germany in its longest post-war period of coalition-building.
The SPD at first refused to take part, leaving Mrs Merkel with the task of forming a government with the FDP and the Greens. But she failed.
Pressure then mounted on the SPD and, after weeks of difficult negotiations, the parties finally reached a deal. 
Yet the coalition was constantly troubled by calls for change and signs of discontent. And state elections in Bavaria and Hesse turned against the CDU and SPD - proving for many that voters were disenchanted with their leaders.
Mrs Merkel said she had made the decision not to run for her party's leadership many months ago but given the announcement came immediately after her party's poor performance in the state elections, many will draw the line between the events.
Until her departure, she remains one of the longest-serving heads of the CDU, and of modern Germany itself.

He asks her if she's getting her medicine, and promises they'll be re-united soon. But he knows it's a promise he can't keep.
Mohamed and his parents escaped from the horrors of the Syrian civil war in December 2012. Taking refuge in Jordan, they applied to settle in the US. In the autumn of 2016, Mohamed's father died. Shortly afterwards, Mohamed was approved to travel to the US.
It was a hard decision, but Mohamed and his mother believed she soon would join him. So Mohamed made the journey, arriving in America just weeks before President Trump was sworn in.
But Mohamed's mother was now a widow, meaning checks on her application had to be carried out again. Then came President Trump's first travel ban. It paused refugee resettlement, and banned Syrian refugees indefinitely. More than a year later, Mohamed's mother is still waiting. 
The administration paused the refugee programme in order to bring in security checks which it said would protect Americans. But even after legal challenges to the travel ban opened the way for reunification cases like the Chaghlils, families are still waiting to see each other again.
""It was already a two-year screening process. I don't think the new vetting procedures are having an impact on the safety of the US. It's just a way to delay the programme,"" says Mary Giovagnoli, chair of Refugee Council USA. Her group represents America's refugee resettlement agencies across the country. 
RCUSA also claims there's a bureaucratic go-slow in the screening programme, with fewer refugee interviews being scheduled abroad, and staff being re-assigned elsewhere. What's happening is ""a meticulous effort to dismantle the refugee programme,"" she says.
It's a view shared by Chris George, who runs the office in Connecticut that welcomed Mohamed. 
""Most of the refugee programme has been pretty much suspended or slowed down to a crawl. In 2016, my organisation welcomed 530 refugees. We'll be lucky if we make 200 this year.""
The total number of refugees the US will admit in a year is set by the president. In October 2017, President Trump declared it would be 45,000. That was a significant drop from the cap of 110,000 set by President Obama in 2016, and the lowest cap in nearly 30 years.
In the six months since that cap was set, the US has admitted just 10,548 refugees. That means the US is on course to welcome the lowest number since the modern refugee programme began in 1980. 
RCUSA worries that decreasing number of refugees is creating a ""vicious cycle"", in which ""fewer refugees means they can justify reducing capacity. And then a reduction in capacity justifies accepting fewer refugees"".
More than 20 refugee resettlement offices nationwide are now slated for closure. The Trump administration says consolidating affiliate offices will improve efficiency. And it points out that the US is the top contributor to international organisations assisting refugees. 
If resettlement offices close, it could increasingly fall to volunteers to keep alive America's tradition of welcoming those most in need.
In December 2014, Robin Baslaw heard a radio news story the Syrian civil war and decided to help. She got together volunteers from local synagogues and churches, and helped by Chris George's refugee office, they had welcomed a family of Afghan refugees to their town of Branford just a month later.
For Robin, the motivation is simple. ""We do this to save lives. My mother was a Holocaust survivor from France, and I'm doing the work that others did to get me here"".
The latest new arrivals to Branford are Zahir, his wife Nooria, and their young son Bahij. Zahir's work as a translator for the US Marines in Afghanistan made the family the target of attacks from the Taliban. He was nearly shot, and his wife discovered a bomb under their car. They arrived in January.
They came to the US under the Special Immigrant Visa programme which helps people whose lives are in danger as a result of their work with the US in Iraq or Afghanistan. The scheme has continued without significant change under the Trump administration. Since October, there have been 8,020 SIV arrivals.
The family's new life is everything they dreamed of. Zahir is working. Volunteers helped find a friendly landlord, and furniture for their home. Other volunteers give them English tuition. When a local store donated running clothes, Nooria was able to go for jogs in the neighbourhood - something that wasn't permitted in Afghanistan.
But Robin's team worry about the Trump administration's refugee policy.
""My family were from refugees and their experience was so different,"" says Susan Smith. ""They were part of a wave that was welcomed. I worry the next generation won't know that.""
But Chris George remains positive. ""We're up against formidable anti-refugee forces,"" he says. ""But welcoming refugees is probably the best thing this country does. 
""It's the Statue of Liberty in action. It's much more powerful than any single president. And it will return, at high, respectable numbers. It will return one day.""

Shabaz Ali, 25, remains seriously ill in hospital after an assault on 3 May in Upper Gilmore Place, Edinburgh. 
Sivan Ali said he had been unable to gain access to temporary council housing to clean and furnish it.
However, the council said the accommodation offered to Mr Ali is clean and in a ""liveable state"". 
City of Edinburgh council leader Adam McVey said he had spoken with Shabaz Ali's father and given him assurance that he could access the property on Thursday.
A 17-year-old has been arrested and charged with attempted murder following the incident involving Mr Ali.
His father said his son had serious injuries and was ""deeply traumatised"" but what has happened.
He is due to be discharged to temporary council accommodation but Mr Ali said housing regulations had prevented him from getting the key to clean and furnish it.
He told BBC Scotland: ""I went to the house and there was only a bed and no other furniture and the carpet was dirty.
""So I said please can you give me a key so I can buy furniture before my son arrives from hospital.
""But they said no they can't give me a key because my son has to sign the agreement and they wouldn't let him sign it at the hospital.""
Council leader Mr McVey said: ""Along with other partners in the city we have done everything we possibly can to ensure that Shabaz Ali is given the support he needs in his current circumstances. 
""I personally visited the flat he will be moving into this afternoon and found it to be clean and fully furnished. I also spoke to his father about any issues he had with the property and have since given him assurance that he will be given access to the property in the morning and at other times if required. 
""This will allow him to add any final personal touches he feels he would like to add. I will ensure that Shabaz is fully supported when moves into the property and I wish him a full and speedy recovery.""

Her decision comes after her party suffered heavy losses in regional elections that threatened the stability of the governing coalition.
Mrs Merkel has been chair of the CDU since 2000, becoming one of its longest-serving chairpersons.
She has led Germany as chancellor since 2005 - and wants to stay in that post.
However, news of Mrs Merkel decision could spark a race within the CDU to find her successor as chancellor.
The position is usually determined in Germany's federal elections, the next of which are provisionally scheduled for 2021.
Mrs Merkel has reportedly told leaders of her Christian Democratic Union (CDU) party that she will step aside from the leadership election bid after the centre-right party and the centre-left Social Democrats (SPD) both took a hit in ballots in Hesse state at the weekend.
However, she said that she would like to remain in the post of Germany's chancellor until 2021, local media report. 
This would be in contrast to Mrs Merkel's previous position, in which she has linked the party leadership role to the chancellorship - meaning that she would only remain chancellor if she was party leader. 
One attendee at Mrs Merkel's announcement told AFP she said this would be ""her last term"". The source said Mrs Merkel ""was genuinely sad and not at all bitter"" - and that she received a standing ovation.
Jenny Hill, BBC Berlin correspondent
Predicting the political demise of Angela Merkel has become almost a national sport. Today Germany's battle-scarred leader has herself formally marked what might be termed the beginning of the end. 
Mrs Merkel has always said that she could only be chancellor if she also held the role of party leader. Her willingness now to give up the latter is intended to silence critics in her party but it also reflects her dwindling grip on power. 
Much depends on her successor as party leader. If it's a loyalist, Germany might witness a smooth transition to a new chancellor, possibly allowing Mrs Merkel to see out her term. 
But the vultures are circling. Already an old rival, Friedrich Merz has announced his candidacy. If one of her political adversaries prevails as party leader, Mrs Merkel's chancellorship becomes uncomfortable and possibly untenable. 
Mrs Merkel, the country's first female chancellor, rose to power on the image of a prudent and pragmatic leader.
It was, however, her open-door refugee policy that sparked public concern and helped fuel parties like the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD).
The Greens have also grown in national support.
Mrs Merkel's migration policy has exposed the fragility of her divided coalition government - and even within her own political group.
Sexual assaults by migrants in Cologne and Islamist attacks in Germany all dented the chancellor's popularity.
Mrs Merkel has stopped short of admitting making a mistake, but has said ""if I could, I would turn back the clock many years"" to prepare Germany better for the influx of arrivals.
Among the potential candidates are ambitious Health Minister Jens Spahn; the Prime Minister of North Rhine-Westphalia, Armin Laschet; and the woman seen as Mrs Merkel's anointed heir, Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer.
Following news of Mrs Merkel's decision on Monday, former CDU parliamentary group leader Friedrich Merz indicated that he wanted to join the race for party leadership, Reuters news agency reports.

http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-44520564,refugee,18 June 2018,By Louise Wilson,What's on at Holyrood? Brexit talk latest and World Refugee Day,"Find out what is happening at the Scottish parliament this week - with an update on Brexit negotiations and possible fireworks over FoIs.
Brexit Minister Michael Russell is due to make a statement on progress in EU exit negotiations on Tuesday afternoon. 
It follows the SNP at Westminster pledging to ""frustrate"" the Brexit process as much as possible after clause 15 of the EU Withdrawal Bill - the elements relevant to devolution - were debated for just 15 minutes.
Expect cries of ""power grab"" and ""democratic outrage"" from the SNP benches, while the Scottish Conservatives will accuse the SNP of staging stunts and stirring up ""constitutional grievances"".
Also of interest this week will be Scottish Labour's debate on transparency.
No doubt the party will raise further questions around the Scottish Information Commissioner's criticism of government handling of freedom of information requests last week.
Here is a rundown of the rest of the week...
Only one topical question this week, from SNP MSP Sandra White who will ask about the fire at the Glasgow School of Art.
After the Brexit statement, MSPs will debate the Scottish Crown Estate Bill for the first time.
Powers over Crown Estate land in Scotland were devolved in April 2017 and this bill seeks to reform management of the land - primarily by empowering local authorities and community groups to run parts of it.
The environment committee, tasked with considering the bill thus far, has recommended MSPs back it on Tuesday evening.
SNP MSP Gillian Martin will end the day with a focus on Women in Engineering Day for her members' business. The day is officially marked on Saturday and the motion calls for more to be done to encourage women into the engineering and tech sectors.
Tuesday morning's committee pick is the economy committee as it continues its inquiry on bank branch closures - this time taking evidence from the banks themselves.
Representatives from TSB, Santander, Lloyds, Clydesdale and RBS will appear before the committee. They are unlikely to get off lightly.
The other committee worthy of a brief mention is the environment committee as it begins consideration of the Climate Change Bill.
In addition to its debate on transparency, Scottish Labour will also continue its criticism of the Scottish government's handling of health.
Labour will call for patients to have access to the life-prolonging medicines, Perjeta and Orkambi, as a matter of urgency. 
After that, Tory MSP Adam Tomkins' member's debate will highlight the value of music tourism in Glasgow.
On Wednesday morning, the rural economy and connectivity committee will hear from the management team of Prestwick Airport.
The airport has been struggling to get back onto sound financial footing since the Scottish government bought it for £1 in 2013.
Recent concerns have been voiced about about staff pay and military use of the airport.
Elsewhere:
With World Refugee Day taking placing on Wednesday, the Scottish government will debate the topic on Thursday afternoon.
Scotland has taken in a big chunk of the 10,000 Syrians who have sought refuge in the UK - around four times as many as those settled in London.
Ahead of this, SNP MSP Christina McKelvie marks MND Awareness Week 2018 with her member's debate, while Finance Secretary Derek Mackay will confirm provisional expenditure figures for council services in 2017-18.
We've opted for the Equality and Human Rights Committee which will take evidence on human rights and Holyrood and then on bullying and harassment in schools. A report last year highlighted the extent of the problem and recommended teachers receive appropriate training and schools take steps to foster more inclusive cultures.
The other interesting committee this morning is the Social Security Committee which is considering regulations for the new Funeral Expense Assistance benefits to be rolled out as Scotland's social security agency comes into existence.

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-45999610,refugee,27 October 2018,None,Migrant caravan: Mexico offers temporary work permits,"Mexico has offered temporary work permits to migrants who register for asylum, as a big caravan of Central American migrants makes its way through the country toward the US.
The plan also envisages temporary ID cards, medical care and schooling. 
But to qualify, migrants must remain in Mexico's southern Chiapas and Oaxaca states.
The US has warned that about 800 troops may be sent to the US-Mexico border to stop the migrant caravan.
""I am bringing out the military for this National Emergency,"" US President Donald Trump tweeted earlier this week. ""They [the migrants] will be stopped!""
The president also threatened to cut aid to Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras.
The mid-term elections are less than two weeks away and critics say Mr Trump has used the threat of illegal immigration to fire up his supporters.
However, the caravan, which set off from Honduras several weeks ago, is still more than 1,000 miles away from Mexico's northern border with the US. 
The scheme, announced by President Enrique Peña Nieto, covers Central Americans who have officially asked for refugee status in Mexico or are planning to do so in the near future.
It is called Estás en Tu Casa (""You're in Your Home"" in Spanish).
""Today, Mexico extends you its hand,"" President Peña Nieto said.
But he added: ""This plan is only for those who comply with Mexican laws, and it's a first step towards a permanent solution for those who are granted refugee status in Mexico.""
The plan envisages:
But President Peña Nieto failed to explain what would happen to the migrants if they chose to carry on regardless.
The Mexican authorities are coming under increasing pressure from the Trump administration to find a solution to this caravan, reports the BBC's Central America correspondent Will Grant in the town of Arriaga, Chiapas.
The authorities are trying to tread a balance between placating the US and giving a green light to travel to potential future caravans, our correspondent adds.
The caravan is presently in Arriaga. 
Most migrants said they had no intention of abandoning their plans to head to the US.
""The majority plan to cross the border. And that's my intention, too,"" José Santos, from Honduras, told the BBC.
""Because, yes, while life here is calmer than at home, it's still not like the US where it would get better. That's the goal: to have a better life.""
Meanwhile, Anna Lisset Velázquez, also from Honduras, told the BBC: ""It's a kind offer - but it's not the plan that we have, to stay here halfway up.""
However, another migrant described Mr Peña Nieto's proposal as a decent ""plan B"".
""Because we can't go back to Honduras. So as a second choice, we'd be better off here,"" Greville Juan Villanova said. 
A spokesman for the United Nations said more than 7,000 people had joined the migrant caravan as of 22 October, citing estimates from the International Organization for Migration. 
But the group has split up, which makes it difficult to determine the exact number.
The migrants say they are fleeing persecution, poverty and violence in their home countries of Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador.
On Thursday, Mr Trump once again urged the migrants to stay away, tweeting: ""To those in the caravan, turn around, we are not letting people into the United States illegally.""
Many of the migrants say they plan to seek asylum in the US.
There is a legal obligation under international law to hear asylum claims from migrants who have arrived in the US if they say they fear violence in their home countries.
But in June, US Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced that victims of domestic abuse and gang violence would no longer generally qualify for asylum in the US.
Those seeking asylum must be fleeing due to a serious fear of persecution in their home country. Under international law, these are considered refugees.
If an asylum seeker enters the US illegally, they are still entitled to have their claim heard. 
Economic migrants are those seeking a better quality of life - and even if they are fleeing devastating poverty, they are not considered refugees and do not have the same protections.
The mid-term elections are less than two weeks away. Critics say Mr Trump has used the threat of illegal immigration to fire up his supporters.

Twelve-year-old Mohammed's class won a trip to Majorca next month, but his travel documents may not be ready.
His class at Canal View Primary in Wester Hailes won a top prize in a UK-wide competition.
Their visit to Majorca will include taking part in workshops.
However, their delight has been tempered by the news that travel documents for their classmate may take up to three months to process.
His MP Joanna Cherry raised the issue in parliament, and called on the prime minister to step in to ensure he is not left out.
Theresa May has indicated the home secretary will look into the case.
The pupils won their place on the trip after devising and creating a competition entry in response to a challenge posed by Jet2holidays which was to produce a promotional piece for Sol Katmandu Park & Resort.
Five schools across the region were shortlisted, but the pupils at Canal View Primary School were voted the winner by public vote for their creation - a stop-motion promotional animation.
Joanna Cherry MP said: ""It is unacceptable that this young Syrian schoolboy will find himself excluded from joining his classmates on a dream holiday because of Home Office procedures.
""The prime minister must immediately step in and right this grievous wrong.
""I was contacted by Canal View's head teacher Ann Moore asking if there was anything which I could do to help.
""The school and the class are obviously devastated that Mohammed has been told he can't join them on this holiday of a lifetime. 
""It is terrible to think of the hardship this wee boy has overcome to get to Edinburgh and start a new life in safety. Today I have asked the Prime Minister and Home Secretary to intervene and make sure Mohammed can join his class mates. 
""I'm delighted that the prime minister has indicated that the home secretary will look into this case and I shall make sure she does so urgently.""
The school has also won £1,000 worth of school equipment vouchers after being shortlisted.

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-australia-45819082,refugee,11 October 2018,None,Nauru refugees: Doctors urge evacuations amid 'complete despair',"Medical charity Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) has called for the immediate evacuation of all asylum seekers on Pacific nation Nauru, amid a ""devastating"" mental health crisis.
MSF provided 11 months of care to those housed in an Australian-run detention centre on the tiny island, but was recently ordered by Nauru to leave.
It treated 78 people who had attempted suicide or self-harm during that time.
Authorities in Nauru and Australia have not responded to MSF's call.
The Nauru detention centre was set up by Australia in 2013 in a controversial deal to house asylum seekers intercepted while trying to reach Australian shores by boat.
Canberra maintains its policy prevents deaths at sea and discourages people smugglers but the tough stance has been widely criticised.
MSF Australia executive director Paul McPhun said: ""This policy should be stopped immediately and should not be replicated by any government.""
MSF had provided free mental health treatment to both refugees and the Nauruan population. On Sunday, MSF said it had been ordered off the island.
""We are extremely concerned for the ongoing mental health of all our patients on the island including asylum seekers and refugees who remain in a complete state of hopelessness and despair,"" Mr McPhun said.
More than 900 refugees and asylum seekers - including about 100 children - are on Nauru, according to the Refugee Council of Australia. 
The charity said it had seen ""significant levels of self-harm and suicide attempts"" on the island, including among children as young as nine.
Psychiatrist Dr Beth O'Connor said she had treated children suffering from traumatic withdrawal syndrome - a rare psychiatric condition where in response to severe trauma, sufferers effectively withdraw from life. 
""When I went to visit these children at home, they had taken to their bed. They were no longer eating or drinking sufficient amounts to keep themselves alive. Many were not able to toilet themselves,"" Dr O'Connor said.
It comes amid ongoing calls by human rights organisations for the Australian government to remove all child asylum seekers held on Nauru.
On Wednesday, Australia's Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton reiterated that asylum seekers and refugees would not be relocated.
""If I did that, I would restart boats and then you would be asking me of the children drowning at sea,"" he told reporters.
He said that Nauru had been ""upset"" about medical support offered by MSF to asylum seekers, but did not give further details.

http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-43002680,refugee,9 February 2018,None,Ugandans suspended over 'refugee scam',"Four Ugandan government officials have been suspended amid allegations of inflating refugee figures.
Uganda's Commissioner for Refugees Apollo Kazungu and three of his senior staff are being investigated. 
Investigations will also consider whether officials from UN aid agencies were involved.
Uganda is said to host some 1.4 million refugees - welcoming more than any other country in 2016 - mostly from South Sudan and DR Congo.
But these allegations will cast doubts on those figures.
Until recently, Uganda had been widely praised for its immigration policies and described as one of the best places in the world to be a refugee.
The Ugandan Daily Monitor, which first reported the allegations, says the issue was first raised by UN country representative Rosa Malango.
The newspaper says she raised three issues, including ""doubtful"" numbers of refugees, the trafficking of women and children, and fraud.
One spot-check in the capital Kampala found just 7,000 people when there were reported to be 26,000 needing aid, the Daily Monitor reports, leading to questions about where the money and resources for the missing 19,000 were going.
A spokesman for the UN's refugee agency, Babar Balouch, told BBC Focus on Africa radio: ""The reports we have received included faking documents on delivery of food assistance and demanding refugees to pay bribes for services which should be free.""
He added: ""If there are found to be any UNHCR staff involved in this, we have a robust mechanism to make everyone accountable."" 
The Ugandan minister responsible for refugees, Hilary Onek, told the BBC that a senior police commissioner has been appointed to lead the investigation, after reports first came to light in December 2017 that aid relief for refugees was being mismanaged.
As a result of the accusations, the United States, European Union and UK are all threatening to withhold funding to the country, the UK's Guardian newspaper says.
A spokesman for Uganda's prime minister told the BBC that ""these reports do not change or deter Uganda's long-held record and commitment to providing safety to refugees"".
The majority of Uganda's refugees have fled violence in South Sudan - where civil conflict between the government and rival factions has killed tens of thousands of people since 2013.
Musa Ecweru, state minister for relief and disaster preparedness, assured the Guardian that measures would be taken to prevent any fraud in future, suggesting biometric registration for all refugees entering the country.
Uganda registered more refugees than any other country in 2016. Here are the latest key UN figures on refugees around the world:

The leader of the far-right League party said his government's plans on migrants were not ""hard line... but common sense"". 
He said that increasing deportations and limiting new arrivals would end up saving lives. 
However, critics have cast doubt on the feasibility of Mr Salvini's plans.
Italy is the main destination for migrants crossing from North Africa to Europe, although numbers have fallen in recent months. 
The country's new populist government involving the anti-establishment Five Star Movement (M5S) and the League was sworn in last week, ending months of uncertainty for the EU's fourth-biggest economy.
The League is strongly anti-immigration and a joint plan agreed with the M5S in forming the new government reflects that stance.
Speaking on Sunday in the Sicilian port of Catania, Mr Salvini said: ""Enough of Sicily being the refugee camp of Europe. I will not stand by and do nothing while there are landings after landings. We need deportation centres.""
He added that he believed the ""best way to save lives is to prevent these people from getting on the boats"". 
He said he would work to discourage ""thousands of desperate people who have the illusion that in Catania, in Sicily, in Italy there is housing and work for everyone"". 
""There is not enough housing and work for Italians, let alone half the continent of Africa.""
Mr Salvini also visited the port of Pozzallo, where a boat carrying more than 150 migrants from sub-Saharan Africa landed on Friday after being rescued by a humanitarian group.
At a rally in northern Italy on Saturday, Mr Salvini had said ""the good times"" for illegal immigrants were over, adding: ""Get ready to pack your bags.""
The joint plan agreed by the League and M5S demands more help from the EU on immigration issues. 
The parties insist that half a million undocumented migrants in Italy must be deported ""as a priority"".
Such action would require the creation of ""temporary stay facilities"" throughout Italy for migrants earmarked for expulsion, the parties say.
The plan also calls for relocation of asylum-seekers EU-wide - a scheme already rejected by some member states. 
In addition, Mr Salvini says he is considering action against organisations rescuing migrants at sea. He has previously accused them of being in cahoots with people-smugglers.
The government's critics say its plan to repatriate migrants is unworkable and risks fomenting racism and politicising a humanitarian issue.
A controversial deal between Italy's former government and authorities in Libya has led to a drop in overall arrivals since last summer.
However, Italian officials say 13,500 migrants have been registered so far this year.

The day before the January 2017 shooting, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau tweeted his support of refugees.
A Canadian court watched Alexandre Bissonnette's police confession during his sentencing hearing on Friday.
The 28-year-old pleaded guilty to six counts of first-degree murder and six counts of attempted murder in March.
Bissonnette stormed into the Quebec Islamic Cultural Centre on 29 January, 2017, and opened fire, killing six Muslims. Five others were seriously injured. 
In the video of the police confession, which was taped the day after the mosque attack, Bissonnette said he feared there would be another terrorist attack in Canada, like the one on Parliament Hill in 2014 or the one in Nice, France in July 2016.
He said he was pushed to act then because he saw television coverage of Mr Trudeau's intention to bring more immigrants into Canada after the US president announced he would be halting all refugee admissions and temporarily barring people from seven Muslim-majority countries.
""Yes, I was listening to TV, and we knew that the Canadian government was going to take more refugees, those who would not be admitted to the United States would be here. And there, I lost the map, "" Bissonnette said during his confession.
""I saw that and they will kill my parents, my family and me too. I was sure of that. I had to do something,"" he said. ""I could not do anything. It's something that tortured me. It's been months that it tortures me. Every day, I am worried, anxious through the ceiling. I do not know what to do. I want to kill myself because of that.""
Last year on 28 January, Mr Trudeau told refugees in a tweet ""Canadians will welcome you, regardless of your faith"".
It was retweeted 418,000 times, liked by over 768,000 Twitter users, and received widespread media coverage.
Bissonnette admitted during the confession he had mental health struggles, and had been prescribed medication to deal with anxiety. He had taken a three-week mental-health leave from work, he said, and was due to return on 30 January. 
His sentencing hearing continues next week, when victims are expected to give their statements.

http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-43772364,refugee,15 April 2018,None,Rohingya crisis: Myanmar says first refugee family returns,"Myanmar says it has repatriated the first family of Rohingya refugees from Bangladesh, despite a UN warning that it is not safe to return.
Some 700,000 Rohingya have fled across the border to escape a brutal military campaign that began last August.
The UN has accused Myanmar of ""ethnic cleansing"" - a charge it denies.
Myanmar says five members of a family arrived at a ""repatriation camp"" on Saturday, and were provided with supplies and ID cards.
If confirmed, this would be the first group of Rohingya repatriated to Myanmar since the crisis began.
The Myanmar government says it has been engaged in a justified campaign against Rohingya militants in Rakhine state.
Earlier this month, it sentenced seven soldiers to prison terms for involvement in the killing of 10 Rohingya men.
Refugees fleeing the country into neighbouring Bangladesh, however, said that such acts were widespread - describing indiscriminate killings, rape, and the burning of villages.
The Rohingya are a mostly Muslim minority ethnic group in Myanmar. They are not recognised by the state, which denies them citizenship and considers them illegal immigrants from Bangladesh.
Analysis by Nick Beake, Myanmar correspondent
A series of posed photographs posted by the Burmese government on Facebook show a man, two women and two children being presented with ID cards with the Myanmar flag in the background.
They're also seen apparently getting medical checks and being interviewed by army officials in uniform.
The first Rohingya family to return to Rakhine State would certainly be a symbolic moment. But the truth is we know little about these people in the photos and the UN is yet to independently confirm their story. 
Who are they? Why did they want to return? What guarantee for their safety? 
Certainly, many of the Rohingya in Cox's Bazar who give harrowing accounts of rape and murder at the hands of the Burmese military have no intention of going back to the place they called home. 
And for those who do, they could well end up stuck in displacement camps for years - which is what happened to previous waves of returnees after earlier outbreaks of violence. 
Photos released by Myanmar authorities on Saturday showed what it called a ""Muslim"" family receiving National Verification Cards. The state does not use the word Rohingya.
The card is a form of ID that does not grant citizenship, and has been rejected by Rohingya leaders in the Bangladesh camps.
On Saturday, just a day before Myanmar's announcement of the Rohingya family's arrival,  the UN refugee agency warned that conditions in Myanmar were ""not yet conducive for returns to be safe, dignified, and sustainable"".
""Refugees in Bangladesh have said that before considering return to Myanmar, they would need to see concrete progress in relation to their legal status and citizenship, security, and their ability to enjoy basic rights at home in Rakhine State,"" the agency said.

Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said on Monday it was ""outrageous"" to suggest that Mr Trump was at all responsible for the 11 deaths on Saturday.
She said the president and first lady will visit Pennsylvania on Tuesday.
The alleged gunman, Robert Bowers, has appeared in court in a wheelchair. 
The mass shooting at the Tree of Life Synagogue is being called the worst anti-Semitic attack in US history.
""The president is not responsible for these acts,"" Mrs Sanders said repeatedly during Monday's news conference when a reporter put it to her that Mr Trump's rhetoric could have played a part in the Pittsburgh attack, or a recent mail bomb scare.
""I think it's irresponsible to blame the president and members of his administration for those heinous acts.""
The press secretary's voice cracked with emotion as she spoke of how the president ""adores"" Jewish Americans.
The suspect was not a Trump supporter - he accused the president in online posts of doing nothing to stop an ""infestation"" by Jews. 
Mr Trump has condemned the shooting, saying there ought to be no tolerance for anti-Semitism.
A Jewish social justice organisation accused the president in an open letter of giving succour to white nationalists.
""President Trump, you are not welcome in Pittsburgh until you fully denounce white nationalism,"" Bend the Arc said in the letter, which now has more than 43,000 signatures.
It noted the president has frequently criticised immigrants and Muslims. 
However, Rabbi Jeffrey Myers, who leads a congregation at the Tree of Life synagogue, said the president was always welcome.
""I'm a citizen, and he's my president, he's certainly welcome,"" Mr Myers said on ABC's Meet the Press.
The alleged gunman was ranting against Jews even as he was treated by Jewish medical staff at the hospital for wounds he received in a gun battle with police.
Jeffery Cohen, president of Allegheny General Hospital, told WTAE-TV: ""He's taken into my hospital and he's shouting 'I want to kill all the Jews!' 
""And the first three people who are taking care of him are Jewish. Ain't that a kick in the pants?""
Just before the attack, the alleged gunman railed on social media against a Jewish refugee relief organisation.
The suspect accused the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society (HIAS) of bringing violent ""invaders"" into the country.
Mark Hetfield, head of HIAS, said on Monday: ""President Trump didn't mention that.
""Hateful words always lead to hateful acts. And that's exactly what happened here. Words matter. And they especially matter when they come from the president of the United States.""
By Jane O'Brien, BBC News
Robert Bowers arrived in court in Pittsburgh shackled to a wheelchair and wearing a blue shirt. 
His hands were untied to enable him to sign his name. It's OK, I can scribble, the 46-year-old truck driver said. 
He spoke little, giving his name, acknowledging the charges against him and stating he could not afford a lawyer.
He was slightly hunched and looked down when addressed by the judge. 
The defendant faces federal murder and assault charges that could carry the death penalty. 
The hearing lasted only a few minutes to set a date for Thursday, when the prosecution will bring evidence. 
Eight men and three women ranging in age from 54 to 97 were killed at the Tree of Life synagogue. 
Several had attended the place of worship since childhood.
Two brothers, and a husband and wife are among the dead.
The first funerals will be held on Tuesday, for Cecil and David Rosenthal.
Mr Bowers allegedly stormed the Tree of Life temple in the Squirrel Hill neighbourhood of Pittsburgh, shouting: ""All Jews must die!""
The FBI says three handguns and an AR-15 rifle, used in many of the nation's mass shootings, were recovered at the scene.
He owned all the weapons legally, officials say.
Survivor Barry Werber, 76, said he hid in a dark storage closet during the rampage.
""I don't know why he thinks the Jews are responsible for all the ills in the world, but he's not the first and he won't be the last,"" Mr Werber told AP news agency. 
""Unfortunately, that's our burden to bear. It breaks my heart.""
A Muslim fundraiser to help victims of the shooting was launched with a goal of $25,000 - it has so far amassed more than $150,000 in donations.

They're Rohingya Muslims who say they are trying to escape persecution in their home country.
Many of them have arrived in Bangladesh with stories of murder, rape and arson at the hands of soldiers and Buddhist mobs.
Myanmar's military says it is fighting Rohingya militants and denies targeting civilians.
Those born in the world's biggest refugee camp before the sudden surge of people in 2017 are entitled to much more than those just arriving in Bangladesh.
Faisal and Hassan, whose names we've agreed to change, are both teenagers and members of the Rohingya population - a stateless group of people who aren't recognised as citizens in Myanmar, where they're from.
They both live with six others but lead very different lives to each other.
Like many other 17 year olds around the world, Faisal works in a shop - his family business.
""We sell cosmetics and hygiene products and get around 20 or 30 customers a day,"" he explains to Newsbeat.
As Faisal was born in the Kutupalong camp, the settlement that's housed Rohingya refugees for decades, he is a registered refugee. 
Those arriving now live in makeshift camps surrounding the registered settlement, don't have the ability to work, and rely on aid agencies for support.
""I think I am lucky because my father gave me an opportunity to open this business,"" he explains. ""But with this business I can't lead my whole life.""
Most Rohingya have made makeshift homes out of bamboo sticks, tarpaulin and corrugated iron.
But for Hassan things are very different. 
Hassan is 16 and moved to Bangladesh six months ago with his family, but can't work or receive an education.
Like most of the newly arrived teenagers, Hassan is grateful he's safe but doesn't like relying on aid agencies for food.
""They give us 30kg of rice, three litres of oil and two packets of pulses,"" he explains through a translator. 
Those supplies feed his family of seven for a week but Hassan says it's not enough.
""It is really painful for us because in Myanmar we used to cultivate food ourselves and we used to get food that was sufficient.
""Here I need to walk a long way and we don't get sufficient food for us.""
Hassan carries those supplies on his shoulder once a week across hills and valleys that's around a 90 minute round trip. 
""My mind is still [in Myanmar] but because of sufferings and torture we are not willing to go back"".

Simon Murphy has documented human rights abuses in countries including the Democratic Republic of Congo, South Sudan, Ethiopia and Colombia.
But nothing prepared him for a trip to Bangladesh with the Scottish Catholic International Aid Fund (SCIAF).
The charity has so far helped more than 40,000 families who have fled Myanmar.
But Simon, from Glasgow, told how many have been left traumatised after witnessing atrocities ranging from sexual violence to mass murder.
He said: ""One girl I photographed saw her parents being killed.
""Others told how they had witnessed villages being torched, children being raped and families being butchered with machetes.
""The Rohingya have lost so much and their experiences are beyond comprehension.""
Shawkat Ara, 38, hid in the jungle and watched her village burn after it was attacked by soldiers in the middle of the night.
She said: ""The military told the young boys to stand in a line and told them to run. 
""When they were running they rushed them from behind and they were falling in ditches.
""Some were cut into pieces and thrown into ditches. 
""They were all between 10 and 12 years old.
""The military were actually playing with the boys. 
""They were telling them to run and then cutting them.""
Although she survived the slaughter Ms Ara, who is five months pregnant, lost her son and parents to hunger as the family fled. 
Despite a recent agreement with the Burmese government for repatriation, refugees continue to arrive in Bangladesh.  
But Mr Murphy said the situation facing those who brave the dangerous border crossing is desperate.
He said: ""New arrivals are taken to a reception area near the harbour.
""They are tired and hungry and have witnessed unspeakable horrors but they have to stay in wooden pens until they are processed.
""It can take up to 48 hours for this to happen and there is a real sense of hopelessness.""
Conditions in the camp are also bleak and there are genuine fears about what will happen when the heavy rains come.
SCIAF director Alistair Dutton said: ""Over 620,000 people have arrived since August alone, overwhelming the camps and those trying to help.   
""After 20 years of working in some of the world's worst humanitarian emergencies, I'm deeply worried by the conditions I've seen.
""Families are living in crowded, makeshift huts made of bamboo and plastic that provide little protection from the baking heat of the sun or the cold of winter nights.""
Mr Dutton warned many shelters are precariously perched on muddy hillsides and at risk of being washed away in the rainy season.
He also expressed concerned about the alarming sanitary situation.
Mr Dutton said: ""Raw sewage is seeping into people's huts where they cook and sleep.  
""Filthy water runs along channels between huts, collecting in stagnant, polluted ponds dotted around the camps."" 
He said the refugees' graphic accounts of the horrors which forced them to flee beggar belief.
Mr Dutton added: ""The Rohingya have experienced unimaginable, barbaric crimes against humanity.  
""Many are traumatised, having seen members of their family and loved ones butchered by machetes, shot or burned alive.  
""Everything they owned was stolen or destroyed.  
""Now they're in Bangladesh with absolutely nothing and desperately need our help."" 
The SCIAF director said Scottish donations, which so far exceed £160,000, are saving lives in Bangladesh.
To date the charity, working with its partner Caritas Bangladesh, has provided rice, lentils, sugar and oil, as well as plates, saucepans, glasses and cooking utensils to more than 40,000 families.  
And in the coming days it will start to distribute blankets and sleeping mats to 14,600 families so they can keep warm at night.
But Mr Dutton urged world leaders to do more as the average length for someone to remain a refugee is 17 years.
He added: ""Despite all the efforts by diplomats and world leaders to negotiate a return, it is likely that the Rohingya will be in exile for many years.  
""The international community must prepare for this and ensure that the conditions in the camps improve.  
""Otherwise, an already appalling situation in Bangladesh will get much, much worse.""

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-45979359,refugee,25 October 2018,None,Home secretary apologises for immigrant DNA tests,"Home Secretary Sajid Javid has apologised to people who were wrongly forced to take DNA tests to prove they were entitled to settle in the UK.
A Home Office review found there were at least 449 cases where letters had been sent with the demand.
Mr Javid told the House of Commons that some relatives of Gurkhas and Afghan nationals employed by the UK government were among those affected.
It was ""unacceptable"" and guidance was ""unclear or wrong"", he said.
The Home Office launched an internal review four months ago after admitting officials wrongly forced immigrants to take DNA tests.
""I want to take this opportunity to apologise to those affected by this practice,"" Mr Javid told MPs.
""The provision of DNA evidence should always be voluntary and never mandatory.""
By Dominic Casciani, BBC home affairs correspondent
The Home Office's internal review of the wrongful DNA demands says the rules were ""not clearly understood"" - not least because immigration officials are drowning in documents. 
There are 40,000 documents in seven IT systems - so it's perhaps no surprise that case workers received advice which was unclear or seemingly contradicted the law. 
Given Sajid Javid has only been in post since April, it raises questions for Amber Rudd, who resigned over misleading MPs over illegal immigrant targets, and her predecessor, the prime minister. 
Theresa May presided over the Home Office for six years and back in 2012 said she wanted to create a ""hostile environment"" for illegal immigration. 
It's that broader policy objective - which critics say leads to applicants being regarded as suspects -  that is under fire yet again. 
When Mr Javid committed to cleaning up the injustices done to the Windrush generation, he underlined that ""hostile environment"" was not a phrase he would use. 
The question is whether a massive post-Brexit reform to the immigration system will convince the Home Office's critics that it can treat all people fairly and equally before the law. 
Mandatory DNA testing was included as a requirement for a 2013 scheme for Afghan nationals formerly employed by the UK government. This has now been removed, Mr Javid said.
In January 2015, similar guidance on DNA testing was included in a scheme for adult dependent children of Gurkhas, who are Nepalese and have been part of the Army for more than 200 years. Mr Javid said this guidance was wrong.
The Home Office report said DNA evidence was requested in 398 cases as part of a 2016 operation investigating fraud, of which 83 applications were refused.
Seven of those cases were refused solely for not providing DNA evidence.
In a further 51 cases, DNA was requested from relatives of Gurkhas.
""I am determined to get to the bottom of how and why, in some cases, people were compelled to provide DNA in the first place,"" he told MPs.
""Across our immigration system, no-one should face a demand to supply DNA evidence and no-one should have been penalised for not providing it.""
Mr Javid said those affected would be reimbursed and he announced he had set up a task force and a review of the immigration system to be informed by Wendy Williams, who investigated the Windrush scandal.
Enny Choudhury, solicitor at the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants, said a mother and daughter she represented were ""rendered destitute"" for two and a half years as a result.
""It is clear that countless others will have been subject to the same treatment and it is astonishing that ministers still do not have a grasp on the failings of the Home Office,"" she said.
Steve Valdez-Symonds, Amnesty UK's Refugee and Migrant Rights Programme Director, said the problems with the Home Office were ""systemic, chronic and deep-rooted"" and in need of urgent reform.

The body of Desirée Mariottini, 16, was found in a derelict building in an area of Rome known for drug trafficking. She had been drugged and gang raped.
Right-wing Interior Minister Matteo Salvini hailed the arrests, condemning those behind the murder as ""worms"".
It would not go unpunished, he said.
Mr Salvini, who leads the anti-immigration League party, has spearheaded measures aimed at scrapping protection for migrants not given refugee status, as well as stopping NGO ships carrying rescued migrants from landing in Italy.
When he visited the scene of Ms Mariottini's murder on Wednesday close to Rome's main Termini station, he was given a mixed reception of cheers and insults. There were shouts of ""jackal"", an insult used by critics who have accused him of taking political advantage of human tragedy.
Investigators believe the victim fell unconscious for several hours last week after being given a cocktail of drugs by several people, and died of an overdose. She was sexually abused before she died.
By Julián Miglierini, BBC News Rome
The slow pace of Italian justice will determine what happened to Desirée - how and why she was killed. 
Details are emerging of her short life, marred by a broken home, substance abuse issues and institutional failings. 
But in populist Italy there is no time for complexities. It is the headline-grabbing promises that work - and Matteo Salvini is a master at riding that wave. 
He showed up twice in one day at the scene of the crime, and - even before the Senegalese men were arrested as suspects - he was already using the case to promise an iron fist in his fight against illegal migration.
That rhetoric is what allowed him to become Italy's most popular politician.
On his social media accounts, Mr Salvini, first as a candidate and now as a minister, has made a point of highlighting serious crimes committed by migrants across the country.
He pushes the idea that serious crimes such as homicide that are committed by migrants are contributing to an increase in violence in Italy - but the statistics from his own ministry contradict these claims.
Police believe as many as six people may have been involved in her death, including two Italians. A third suspect has already been traced. 
They first arrested two Senegalese men, aged 26 and 42, who are described as undocumented migrants, and later picked up a Nigerian man aged 40. All three were suspected of murder, gang rape and supplying drugs, police said.
Further details of Ms Mariottini's last few days have been reported in Italian media. 
After her parents split up she lived with her grandmother. 
The family's lawyer said the day before she disappeared she had phoned her grandmother to say she was staying with a friend in Rome as she had missed her last bus. 
Her friend said the teenager had been sold drugs in exchange for her mobile phone and had gone back to the traffickers in an attempt to retrieve the phone.
Rome Mayor Virginia Raggi, whose populist Five Star party shares power with Mr Salvini's League, has responded to the murder with a promise to increase police patrols and ban alcohol consumption in the streets after 21:00.

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-45555357,refugee,18 September 2018,None,"US slashes number of refugees to 30,000","The US says it will cap the number of refugees allowed into the country next year at a near record low of 30,000.
It compares with a 45,000-refugee limit set by President Donald Trump for 2018 and 50,000 the year before. 
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced ""the new refugee ceiling"", adding the US would also process more than 280,000 asylum seekers in 2019.
The lowest such admissions figure was in 2002, after 9/11, when some 27,000 refugees were allowed into the US. 
Over the past decade, the number of refugees admitted to the US has fluctuated from a low of 48,282 in 2007 to a high of 84,995 in 2016.
The US Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP) was set up in 1980, when Congress passed the Refugee Act.
US and international law currently say that people can seek asylum if they fear persecution at home on the basis of their race, political opinion, nationality, religion or because they belong to a particular social group.
According to the New York Times, Monday's announcement represents the lowest ceiling any president has imposed on the programme since its creation.
The Trump administration has pursued tight restrictions on immigration and critics have accused it of scaling back protection for the world's most vulnerable people.
The US had previously led the world in accepting refugees with more than 3 million people resettled since 1980, according to the Pew Research Center.
Mr Pompeo said it would be ""wrong"" to view the refugee ceiling as ""the sole barometer of America's commitment to vulnerable people around the world"".
The limit had to be viewed ""in the context of the many other forms of protection and assistance offered by the United States"", he said. 
During a brief press conference, in which he did not take any questions from reporters, Mr Pompeo said that the cut was needed because of a backlog of 800,000 pending asylum cases.
He added that the new policy ""serves the national security interests"" of the US.
Eric Schwartz, president of the independent organisation Refugees International, called the new cap ""appalling"". 
In a statement published on the body's website, Mr Schwartz said the decision continues the Trump administration's ""rapid flight from the proud US tradition of providing resettlement to those fleeing persecution around the world"".
Church World Service, a nonprofit group that helps resettle refugees in the US, called it ""an affront to the countless American communities who have welcomed refugees and understand that they are valuable members of our congregations, cities and towns"".
The US is currently on track to admit only about half the maximum number of refugees allowed in 2018.
By the end of August fewer than 20,000 refugees had been admitted, which means it is unlikely that the US will hit its current cap.
According to the United Nations, there are more than 25 million refugees worldwide and another 40 million who are displaced within their own countries.
Around 85% of displaced people are currently living in developing countries.

The streets were empty, as usual, but inside the nicely kept brick houses of this well-to-do neighbourhood, the centre of Jewish life in Pittsburgh, residents faced the inevitable question - do I know anyone?
Many probably did, or at least knew someone who did.
""You wouldn't expect it,"" said 30-year-old Nathan Rittri, who lives just a few houses from the Tree of Life Congregation, where the deadly shooting took place. ""It's very shocking because the neighbourhood is so loving and calm.""
More than a quarter of Pittsburgh's 50,000 Jewish adults and children live in Squirrel Hill, according to the Jewish Federation of Greater Pittsburgh, one of the largest Jewish populations in Pennsylvania.
Several temples from different Jewish denominations, kosher restaurants and local shops form what has been called a ""vibrant oasis"" of Judaism in the city. And so, when a gunman opened fire at a local synagogue, many felt that not only their religion was being attacked, but their own little haven.
""It's a tight-knit community, everyone knows everyone,"" said Adam Hertzman, the federation's marketing director. ""The whole Jewish community is shocked, [but] Jewish Pittsburgh is so close together, like a family, it will not change that.""
The attack - the darkest day of Pittsburgh's history, according to Mayor Bill Peduto - happened as worshippers gathered in a drizzly morning in various rooms at the congregation, home to three different synagogues. The larger one, Tree of Life, was set up in 1864.
The 46-year-old suspect stormed the building and shot indiscriminately. During the attack, he reportedly shouted ""All Jews must die"".
""I always knew there were people who hated Jewish people,"" said 16-year-old student Spencer Lieberman, who avoids wearing Jewish symbols in public, including his necklace with the Star of David. ""But I never imagined anyone would do something like this.""
Eleven people, whose ages ranged from 54 to 97, were killed in the attack, including a couple and two brothers. Six others were injured, including four police officers who engaged in a gun battle with the suspect, and two members of the congregation.
But for many in Squirrel Hill, and probably across the country, this is more than just tragedy coming to a small, close community.
The attack happened amid a perceived rise in hate-related crimes nationwide and at the end of a particularly tense week in which more than a dozen explosive devices were sent to critics of President Donald Trump.  
Some have blamed the president himself for stirring divisions, claims he denies. He called the attack a ""wicked act of mass murder"".
Mr Hertzman, who used to worship at the synagogue attacked and knew two of the dead, said: ""We've certainly seen that anti-Semitism is on the rise across the US. I don't know if it's increased in Pittsburgh or we're just more aware of that.""
The alleged gunman had posted anti-Semitic content on social network Gab under the username ""onedingo"", and the bio on his account, now suspended, read: ""Jews are the children of Satan"".
Hours before attacking the synagogue on International Religious Freedom Day, he criticised refugee aid group Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society (HIAS) and said he could not ""sit by and watch my people get slaughtered"". 
""This shouldn't be happening,"" said 54-year-old resident Dan Berger. ""Divisions have been big in the country. We should all be Americans and all these differences are dividing our country.""
The suspect faces 29 criminal charges, including obstruction of exercise of religious beliefs, a hate crime, and using a firearm to commit murder. All of these can carry the death penalty.
Throughout Sunday, dozens of residents and others brought flowers and candles to Tree of Life's entrance. They were adamant that the attack would not change this place.
""[The attacker] was an anti-Semitic man but he seemed to be a hateful man,"" said 34-year-old Molly Butler, who came with her children, Mikey and Lily, aged nine and six. ""Hate is hate, is terrible and it doesn't have any place in our country, city or Squirrel Hill.""
Ms Butler's family of Orthodox Jews only found out about the shooting in the evening, as they do not use any electronic device, she said. They carried placards thanking the police for keeping ""the Jews in [their] neighbourhood safe"".
""You're going to see an outpouring of love and support and a strengthened community. Not just the Jewish community but Pittsburgh as a whole,"" she said. ""This has touched all of us.""

The convoy was meant to arrive at Rukban camp on 27 October, but was postponed for security reasons.
Syria's army controls access to Rukban, which is near a US-backed rebels' base. Jordan is also blocking aid supplies. 
There have been reports of children dying due to poor sanitary conditions and a lack of healthcare at the camp.
A cluster of about 10,800 makeshift tents and mud huts, the camp has been called ""one of the most desperate places in Syria"".
The UN estimates that 80% of the people stranded at Rukban are women and children, while aid groups say that pregnant women at the camp have given birth without basic medical care. 
The aid convoy, operated jointly by the UN and the Syrian Arab Red Crescent, arrived on Saturday.  
""Seventy-eight trucks are delivering 10,475 food parcels and flour bags, clothes for 18,000 children, 10,075 hygiene kits and plastic sheets, [and] newborn baby kits for 1,200 children,"" the Syrian Arab Red Crescent said in a statement. 
The delivery is expected to take three to four days. 
""We are also conducting an emergency vaccination campaign to protect some 10,000 children against measles, polio and other deadly diseases,"" UN humanitarian co-ordinator Ali Al-Za'tari said. 
The UN added that the overall humanitarian situation at the camp remained ""at a critical stage, with reported shortages of basic commodities... and the death of several children who reportedly were unable to get further medical treatment.""
Those at the camp began arriving in late 2015 after fleeing areas of Syria previously controlled by the militant Islamic State (IS) group.
They wanted to cross into Jordan, which has taken in 670,000 Syrian refugees since the civil war began in 2011, but the kingdom sealed the crossing near Rukban in June 2016 after six soldiers were killed in a bomb attack claimed by IS.
Jordan insisted the camp had to be supplied from Syria, but did allow occasional aid deliveries until January. Since then, residents have had to rely on what the UN has called a ""trickle"" of commercial deliveries.
But even those dried up last month, when Syrian government forces reportedly blocked roads to the camp after the failure of a reconciliation deal with rebel groups in the area. Prices for food and basic supplies increased significantly.

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-46003665,refugee,28 October 2018,None,Pittsburgh shooting: What we know so far,"A gunman entered the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh on Saturday morning and opened fire, killing 11 people.
Six people were injured, among them four police officers, in the attack on the synagogue in the Squirrel Hill district.
The suspect, who was taken into custody, has been named as Robert Bowers, 46.
Here's what we know so far about the shooting.
Warning: This story contains offensive language and anti-Semitic quotes. 
The gunman entered the building shortly before 10:00 local time (14:00 GMT) on Saturday, during a service.
He was armed with three Glock handguns and an AR-15 assault rifle.
He was leaving the building when he was met by emergency responders.
Two officers - among the first to arrive - were injured in an initial confrontation with the gunman.
A further two Swat team members were hurt inside the building, clashing with the shooter. 
The gunman suffered multiple gunshot wounds and surrendered to the authorities. 
The crime scene was ""horrific"", Pittsburgh's Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich told reporters. ""One of the worst I've seen, and I've [worked] on some plane crashes. It's very bad,"" he added.
They were named on Sunday as Joyce Fienberg, 75; Richard Gottfried, 65; Rose Mallinger, 97; Jerry Rabinowitz, 66; Cecil Rosenthal, 59; his brother David, 54; Bernice Simon, 84; her husband Sylvan, 86; Daniel Stein, 71; Melvin Wax, 88, and Irving Younger, 69.
A 61-year-old woman and a 70-year-old man are also currently being treated for injuries. The man had gunshot wounds to the torso and is in a critical condition. 
Daniel Stein's nephew, Steven Halle, described him as ""somebody that everybody liked"" and a ""kind soul"".
He said his uncle had recently become a grandfather and attended the synagogue every Saturday for services. 
One injured officer was released from hospital on Saturday, another was to be released on Sunday with the other two needing more treatment.
The Tree of Life was set up more than 150 years ago, its website says.
It merged with nearby Or L'Simcha congregation about five years ago, to form the Tree of Life - Or L'Simcha Congregation.
The synagogue is in Pittsburgh's east-end Squirrel Hill area, which has a large Jewish community dating back to the 1920s. 
The Jewish Federation of Greater Pittsburgh's President Jeff Finkelstein told reporters up to 50 or 60 people regularly worshipped there on a Saturday morning. 
According to the calendar on its website, Shabbat morning services were scheduled between 09:45 and 12:00.
Extra police officers were deployed at synagogues and Jewish centres across the US after the attack.
The suspect has been named as Robert Bowers. He is in fair condition in hospital.
FBI special agent Robert Jones said that Mr Bowers did not appear to be known to authorities prior to events on Saturday.
Mr Bowers has posted anti-Semitic content on social network Gab under the username ""onedingo"".
The bio on his account - now suspended - read: ""Jews are the children of Satan"".
On Saturday morning, he criticised refugee aid group Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society (HIAS) and said he could not ""sit by and watch my people get slaughtered"".
""Screw your optics, I'm going in,"" he wrote. 
In earlier posts, he attacked US President Donald Trump and his ""Make America Great Again"" (Maga) slogan, as well as the Jewish community. 
""Trump is a globalist, not a nationalist,"" he wrote.
In another post, he said: ""For the record, I did not vote for him [Trump] nor have I owned, worn or even touched a maga hat.""
He also expressed support for the QAnon conspiracy - an unsubstantiated, far-right fringe theory based on the belief that Mr Trump is organising a secret plan to investigate and arrest famous or politically elite child abusers.
Gab is a social network site created in August 2016 as an alternative to Twitter. 
Founder Andrew Torba told Buzzfeed News he set it up as a response to the ""entirely left-leaning Big Social monopoly"". 
Critics say it is a space for hate speech and people banned from mainstream social media. It was dubbed ""the ultimate filter bubble"" in a Wired editorial that attacked the network. 
However, Mr Torba stressed the site was not for any particular group or political supporters, and has reiterated this on his Gab page. 
In the wake of the shooting, the website released a statement condemning the attack.
""Gab unequivocally disavows and condemns all acts of terrorism and violence,"" it read. ""This has always been our policy.""

http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-42857434,refugee,30 January 2018,By Yolande Knell,Palestinians fear cost of Trump's refugee agency cut,"""Dignity is priceless,"" read the signs as thousands of employees of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees march through central Gaza City.  
They fear Washington's recent decision to withhold $65m (52.5m euros; £46m) - possibly rising to $290m - in funds could affect their positions as well as basic services which most of them, as refugees, rely on. 
""Unrwa was there every moment for me,"" says Najwa Sheikh Ahmed, an information officer with the UN Relief and Works Agency.  
""It gave not only food, clothes, education and healthcare but also a job and the opportunity that offers your family.""  
Najwa was born in Khan Younis refugee camp and brought up in tough conditions.
She moved to Nuseirat camp when she married her husband, who is also Unrwa staff.  They have five children. 
When I visit, we pass along narrow streets to the local clinic, painted in the blue and white colours of the UN, so Najwa can get a medical check.  
I watch her eldest daughter, Salma, as she excels in an English lesson.  She is one of 270,000 Unrwa students in Gaza.
""As a mother I feel very worried,"" Najwa confides. 
""If the funding gap isn't bridged, then Unrwa might find itself in a situation where [it has] to close the schools and health services. My children will be at risk.""
The US is the largest single donor to Unrwa.  Last year, it gave the agency around $360m - about half of the total amount it gave in support to the Palestinians.
President Donald Trump first indicated a change in approach on 2 January when he Tweeted that his country got ""no appreciation or respect"" for the large sums of aid it gave.  
The State Department insists that freezing Unrwa funds is linked to needed ""reforms"", but suspicions remain that it is meant to punish Palestinian leaders.  
They cut ties with the White House weeks earlier after it recognised Jerusalem as Israel's capital.  The Palestinians claim East Jerusalem as the capital of their future state.
Last week in Davos, Switzerland, Mr Trump said that aid to the Palestinians would be suspended ""unless they sit down and negotiate peace"".
In the impoverished Gaza Strip, which has eight refugee camps, ordinary people complain that they find themselves helplessly caught up in geopolitics.
Unrwa was originally set up to take care of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians displaced by the 1948 Arab-Israeli war.  
Nearly 70 years on, some of those refugees and many of their descendants continue to live in camps, which are now chronically overcrowded breeze block neighbourhoods.   
Unrwa supports some five million people not only in the Palestinian Territories but also in Jordan, Lebanon and Syria - where Palestinian refugees have limited rights. 
The fate of the refugees is a core issue in the Arab-Israeli conflict and they have often been at the heart of Palestinian political and militant activity.
Palestinians call for their ""right to return"" to parts of historic Palestine - land which is now in Israel. 
Israel rejects that claim and has often criticised the set-up of Unrwa for the way it allows refugee status to be inherited, which it points out is uniquely applied to Palestinians among all the world's refugees.
""How long are we going to have Unrwa? Another 70 years?"" the Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said to me at a recent press event.  
""We already have great-great-grandchildren who are refugees - who are not refugees but they're on the list of Unwra.""
Mr Netanyahu suggests donations should be shifted to other humanitarian agencies, including the UN High Commission for Refugees.
""It will have positive effects because the perpetuation of the dream of bringing the descendants back to Jaffa is what sustains this conflict,"" he told me.  
""Unrwa is part of the problem not part of the solution.""  
Unrwa officials stress that the UN General Assembly sets their mandate and dismiss the idea it obstructs any Israel-Palestinian peace deal. 
""It is the failure of the political parties to resolve the refugee issue that perpetuates it,"" says Unrwa spokesman Chris Gunness.  
""As soon as there's a resolution of that based on international law, based on United Nations resolutions, Unrwa will go out of business and hand over its service.""  
The agency has now launched a global appeal to fill the gap in its budget and is receiving many messages of support - including from celebrities and 21 international humanitarian groups.
Some in Israel also raise concerns that weakening Unrwa could cause regional instability and create more extremism.  
""While Unrwa is far from perfect, the Israeli defence establishment and the Israeli government as a whole, have over the years come to the understanding that all the alternatives are worse for Israel,"" a former Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesman, Peter Lerner, wrote in Haaretz newspaper.  
At the rally in Gaza City, participants focus on the impact of any Unrwa cutbacks on the most needy but also on existential issues.
""Without Unrwa nobody will identify us as refugees,"" says Najwa Sheikh-Ahmed - whose father fled from his home in al-Majdal - now in Ashkelon in southern Israel - as a boy in 1948.  
""My refugee number, my ration card is witness to the fact that once upon a time I had a homeland,"" she says.  ""Without this we will lose the right to fight for our rights.""

http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-42155782,refugee,29 November 2017,By Jordan Davies,Syrian refugee language classes 'shortage' in Wales,"There is a shortage of appropriate English classes for resettled Syrian refugees in Wales, according to people who deliver the tuition.
They have raised concerns refugees may find it more difficult to find employment and become financially self-sufficient as a result. 
It comes after a report found gaps in tuition provision across the country.
The Home Office said it had pledged £10m to help local authorities make sure more tuition was available.
To the end of March, a total of 472 people had been resettled to Wales under the Syrian Vulnerable Person Resettlement Programme, which began in September 2015.
Everyone over the age of 19 is entitled to free English language tuition.
But the report by the Wales Strategic Migration Partnership, based in Cardiff, found only two of Wales' 22 local authorities reported ""no gaps"" in local provision. Failings included a lack of suitable courses and qualified teachers.
Dr Mike Chick, senior lecturer in Teaching English for Speakers of other Languages at the University of South Wales, said there should be more money for tailored courses.
""The biggest issue is funding, families are coming over and by and large most of them have a very limited command of English, therefore, they need quite an intensive programme of language tuition,"" he said.
""They are all in the same class, so, instead of having tailored, effective, level based classes - all the learners are currently in the same class, which doesn't really make for the most effective teaching of English.""
The Home Office provides Welsh councils with £8,250 per person to pay for health, housing, education and ESOL (English as a second language) lessons for refugees under the resettlement programme.
This drops to £1,000 by the fifth and final year of support, with the aim of resettled refugees becoming self-sufficient in that time.
But there is concern that a lack of tailored English tuition means some will not achieve this goal.
Erica Williams, ESOL co-ordinator for the partnership, said there was a lot of good practice among councils in Wales.
But she said making sure the right tuition gets to the right person was taking longer than expected.
""I think the idea was that after 12 months in this country families would be ready to move on, to be more independent - that isn't necessarily happening,"" she said.
""We have to be aware there are troughs and dips and peaks in re-settlement in a different culture and it's not going to be straightforward moving forward, we need to be able to adapt to the needs of different people.""
The Home Office, which funds English language tuition for the resettlement programme, said the UK was resettling people on an ""unprecedented scale"" with more than 8,500 people, half of whom were children, having arrived on the Vulnerable Person Resettlement Scheme. 
""We recognise that refugees need to be helped to integrate into society and we have put in place significant measures to ensure this can happen,"" said a spokesman.
""On English language skills specifically, this has included providing £10m to help local authorities make sure more tuition is available and introducing measures to ensure resettled refugees have access to eight hours' formal tuition a week.""

Andreas Hollstein, conservative mayor of Altena, was stabbed in the neck in a kebab shop and had hospital treatment. 
The town in North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW) is well known for having accepted more than its quota of migrants. 
""The security authorities believe that there was a political motive,"" said NRW premier Armin Laschet. The mayor is in Chancellor Angela Merkel's CDU party.
Witnesses quoted by German media said the assailant - now in custody - shouted criticism of the mayor's asylum policy during the attack on Monday night.
In a tweet, Mrs Merkel condemned the attack (in German). ""I am outraged by the knife attack on Mayor Andreas Hollstein, and very relieved that he is able to be back with his family. Thanks also to those who helped him,"" she said.
The poor performance of her Christian Democrats in the September general election has been attributed largely to criticism of her liberal immigration policy, summed up by her motto ""we can manage"". 
She accepted more than a million asylum seekers - many of them Muslims - during Europe's 2015-2016 migrant crisis.

Ten attacks a day on Germany migrants
Altena - with about 17,000 residents - won a national award in May for integrating migrants. The town strives to house migrants in normal apartment blocks, rather than in migrant hostels, German ARD news reports.
Mr Hollstein, 57, told a news conference on Tuesday that the kebab shop owner - Demir Abdullah - and his son had overpowered the knifeman. 
He thanked them and Mr Abdullah's wife, who had called the police. ""I'm sure that if they hadn't reacted like that I wouldn't be alive now,"" he said, wearing a big plaster on his neck.
The 56-year-old attacker was reportedly drunk and used a 30cm-long (1ft) knife. 
German Justice Minister Heiko Maas tweeted (in German): ""We must never accept attacks on people who are just helping others. Our country must not tolerate hatred and violence.""
The attack has reminded Germans of the stabbing of another CDU politician, Henriette Reker, in 2015.
Ms Reker was elected mayor of Cologne in October 2015. While campaigning she had been stabbed by a man claiming to be angry over the CDU's refugee policy.
For the first time in a federal election the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) polled strongly enough in September to enter the German parliament, winning 94 seats. It campaigns against what it calls the ""Islamisation"" of Germany, denouncing the CDU's asylum policy.

Washington will hand over $60m (£43m) of a planned payment to the UN Relief and Works Agency (Unrwa), but keep back $65m until it carries out ""reforms"". 
UN Secretary General António Guterres said it could be forced to cut health care, education and social services.
Millions of refugees' dignity and human security were at stake, Unrwa said.
The Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) accused the US of ""targeting the most vulnerable segment of the Palestinian people"".
Earlier this month, President Donald Trump threatened to cut aid to the Palestinians over what he called their unwillingness to negotiate with Israel.
On Sunday, Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas sharply attacked Mr Trump's peace efforts, saying he would no longer accept the US as a mediator following its controversial recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital.
The US is the largest single donor to Unrwa, providing $368m in 2016 and funding almost 30% of its operations to help some five million refugees across the Middle East.
On Tuesday, US state department spokeswoman Heather Nauert told reporters that the Trump administration had committed to a voluntary contribution of $60m for 2018, so that Unrwa did not run out of funds and schools and health care facilities would not have to close. 
An additional $65m of funding would be ""held for future consideration"" but not cancelled, she said.
Ms Nauert explained that the US would ""like to see some revisions made in how Unrwa operates"", to ensure that the money was ""best spent"" so that people got the services they needed.
She did not mention whether US bilateral aid to the Palestinians was also at risk. That amounted to $260m in 2016, with much of the money going towards projects administered by the US Agency for International Development (USAid).
By contrast, Israel receives more than $3bn in military aid per year from the US.
Unrwa Commissioner-General, Pierre Krähenbühl, warned that the agency was ""now confronted with the most dramatic financial crisis"" in its 69-year history.
""Given the long, trusted, and historic relationship between the United States and Unrwa, this reduced contribution threatens one of the most successful and innovative human development endeavours in the Middle East,"" he said.
He called on other UN member states to increase their contributions in response.
""At stake is the access of 525,000 boys and girls in 700 Unrwa schools, and their future,"" he said. 
""At stake is the dignity and human security of millions of Palestine refugees, in need of emergency food assistance and other support in Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, and the West Bank and Gaza Strip. 
""At stake is the access of refugees to primary health care, including pre-natal care and other life-saving services.""
Hanan Ashrawi, a member of the PLO's executive committee, accused the Trump administration of seeking to ""dismantle"" Unrwa at Israel's behest.
""This administration is thereby targeting the most vulnerable segment of the Palestinian people and depriving the refugees of the right to education, health, shelter and a dignified life,"" she said.
""It is also creating conditions that will generate further instability throughout the region and will demonstrate that it has no compunction in targeting the innocent.""
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu - who has called for Unrwa's funding to be cut gradually and its responsibilities transferred to the UN's global refugee agency, the UNHCR, arguing that it ""perpetuates the Palestinian problem"" - expressed measured support on Wednesday.
Asked by reporters during a visit to India if he welcomed the US move, he replied: ""Of course, but I still suggest, because I think there are certain needs, to do what I have said... every step taken also contains some risk.""
Some observers in Israel have warned it might have to deal with a humanitarian crisis if Unrwa was forced to halt operations in the Palestinian territories.

Mohammed Al-Homsi was a qualified dentist in Syria but needs to re-qualify to practise in the UK.
He has got a £10,000 loan from RefuAid which supports skilled refugees back into work and has so far helped 12.
At least 397 Syrian refugees have been resettled in Wales, with 5,000 across the UK.
Other people to have benefitted from the scheme include a lawyer from Pakistan, an accountant from Syria and an auditor from Zambia.
A qualified dentist from Damascus, Mr Al-Homsi, 30, who now lives in Llanishen, took up work at a utilities company to support his wife and two daughters.
While he was granted UK refugee status in 2015, his degree was not accepted and re-qualifying exams to practice cost thousands of pounds.

""I was anxious to do the job that I spent nearly 10 years of my life training to do but I couldn't.""

In the photo 12-year-old Muhammet Hussein is seen gazing through the window of the Olimpiyat Sports Center. 
Social media users were touched by the image, commenting on the equipment strapped the the young boy's back and the fact that he was wearing sandals in the middle of winter.

Speaking to Turkish news website Hurriyet Daily News, Muhammet said he was ""very happy"" to be able to attend the gym and grateful to the staff for helping him work out.

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-45920624,refugee,20 October 2018,None,Migrant caravan halted by Mexico police on Guatemala border,"Thousands of people travelling across Central America en masse to the US are stuck on Mexico's southern border after a failed attempt to enter the country.
Some of them broke through Guatemalan border fences but then clashed with Mexican riot police in no man's land.
On Friday, US President Donald Trump thanked Mexico for its efforts in stopping the caravan of migrants.
The migrants, mostly from Honduras, say they are fleeing violence and poverty, and include women and children.
President Trump, who has threatened to close down the US border and cut aid to countries allowing the caravan to pass, said the military would be called upon if needed.
""They might as well turn back, they're not coming into this country,"" he told reporters on Friday.
After talks on border security in Mexico, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the situation was reaching ""a moment of crisis"".
Many of the migrants temporarily broke through barriers on a bridge which crosses the river border between Guatemala and Mexico.
Dozens of Mexican police in riot gear fired tear gas to force them to retreat into no-man's land after being attacked with stones. 
A number of migrants jumped into the Suchiate river to reach rafts, while others either turned back towards Guatemala or simply sat down on the bridge. 
Several people were reportedly injured in the clash, including migrants, police and journalists.
One woman nursing a baby told AFP she had lost two of her children in the chaos.
""We're running away from violence, and we arrive here and they just hit us more,"" Marta Ornelas Cazares, 28, said.
""I don't know what happened, I thought we were going to cross peacefully and then suddenly there were rocks flying and tear gas."" 
The Mexican authorities said those with valid passports and visas would be allowed in immediately, though this is believed to apply to only a minority of the migrants.
They warned that anyone without papers would have to apply for refugee status or turn back, and anyone who crossed illegally would be detained and deported.
According to AFP, they started to allow a small number of people - including women and children - who were seeking refugee status to pass the border late on Friday. They were put on to trucks and taken into shelters.
Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez said he had spoken to his Guatemalan counterpart and asked permission to send his country's civil protection force to the area to help the migrants.
""I also asked for authorisation to hire ground transportation for anyone who wants to return and an air bridge for special cases of women, children, the elderly and the sick,"" Hernandez tweeted. 
The two leaders are due to meet later on Saturday to discuss the situation.
Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto said the border clash was ""unprecedented"" and accused some of the migrants of attacking police.
Human rights groups have criticised the US and Mexican response to the caravan.
Erika Guevara-Rosas of Amnesty International said in a statement: ""These families deserve dignity and respect to ensure that no-one is illegally returned to situations where they could risk serious harm due to violence.""
Since his campaign days, Mr Trump has lambasted illegal immigrants, and this latest caravan comes after a major immigration crackdown. 
Changes to detention rules saw thousands of migrant children detained and separated from their parents at the US-Mexico border earlier this year, sparking national and international condemnation.
Mr Trump's threats come weeks before the mid-term elections on 6 November, which could see Democrats unseating Republicans in the House of Representatives.
According to a Kaiser Foundation poll, immigration is the most important issue for 15% of all voters, though the number jumps to 25% among Republican voters. 
While Mr Trump has sent National Guard troops to the border before, it is unclear what he means by shutting it down entirely, and whether that would affect businesses or people with legitimate visas. 
And according to international law, the US cannot deport asylum seekers without first determining the validity of their claim.
An estimated 10% of the population of Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras have fled danger, forced gang recruitment and dismal economic opportunities.
The region has one of the highest murder rates in the world. The UN reported murder rates in 2015 in Honduras standing at 63.75 deaths per 100,000 and El Salvador at 108.64 deaths.
Jari Dixon, an opposition politician in Honduras, tweeted on Monday that the caravan was not ""seeking the American dream"" but ""fleeing the Honduras nightmare"".
In a statement on Tuesday, Honduras' foreign ministry urged its citizens to ""not let themselves be used by a movement that is clearly political and seeks to disrupt the governability, stability and peace"".

http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-42385589,refugee,18 December 2017,None,Syrian refugee housing target met three years early,"Scotland has met a target to provide homes for 2,000 Syrian refugees three years ahead of schedule.
The UK government has committed to resettling 20,000 people fleeing the war-torn country through the Syrian Vulnerable Person Resettlement Programme.
Local authorities north of the border agreed to take in 10% of that number.
But the council body Cosla said that goal had been reached just two years into the five-year scheme.
First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said: ""Scotland is an open and welcoming country and today's celebration, welcoming the 2,000th Syrian refugee to our country, is testament to that.
""In 2015 I made a commitment that we would take our fair share of Syrian refugees coming to the UK and the hard work and dedication of local authorities across Scotland has meant we have more than met that pledge.
""I am proud that Scotland has welcomed so many refugees fleeing persecution and war into our communities so they can rebuild their lives here.""
Statistics released earlier this month show that Scotland has accepted one in five of Syrians brought to the UK through the resettlement scheme.
Those helped by the initiative include young children in urgent need of medical treatment and life-changing care, who are now building new lives across Scotland.
A further commitment to provide refuge to 3,000 youngsters from the Middle East North Africa region has been made by the UK government, through the associated Vulnerable Children Relocation Scheme.
Those arriving through both programmes are granted refugee status and given leave to remain in the UK for five years in the first instance.
At the end of that period, they are entitled to apply for Indefinite Leave to Remain in the UK.
Local authorities can choose whether or not to participate in the programmes, dependent on local circumstances, but receive a five-year funding package to enable them to participate. 
Omar and Fatima Alaghbar arrived in Edinburgh in November 2015, having fled Syria for Lebanon with their children, Adel and Sara. 
Mrs Alaghbar told BBC Scotland they were met by lots of ""friendly and kind"" people when they moved to Scotland. 
""We were looking to be safe and I think we found safety here in Edinburgh,"" she said. 
Life in Syria was ""very difficult"", she added. ""When you hear the sound of bombs and you see your children scared, you can't stay.""
She said they were very worried about her parents who are still in Syria. 
But she added: ""For me, I would like to stay in Edinburgh but I wish the war was finished and I could see my parents as soon as possible.""
All 32 Scottish councils have committed to supporting resettlement efforts, helped by Cosla, in whatever way they can.
The UK immigration minister will join the first minister and UK representative to the UN high commissioner for refugees at Cosla's headquarters in Edinburgh on Monday, to celebrate the milestone and discuss the future of the programme.
Cosla president Alison Evison said: ""Scottish local government has responded to its moral duty to help and protect those whose lives have been torn apart by war.
""We are proudly leading the way in our commitment to the Syrian Resettlement Programme.
""Council staff and communities across Scotland have truly gone the extra mile to reach the 2,000 goal - working tirelessly to make all the preparations for their new arrivals, finding suitable homes, helping to settle children into school and supporting adults to find employment.""
UK Immigration Minister Brandon Lewis added: ""Scotland, along with the rest of the UK, should be proud of the way it has welcomed some of the most vulnerable refugees, and provided them with safety and security so that they can rebuild their lives.""

Pierre Kompany topped the poll for the municipality of Ganshoren in Brussels, earning him the title of mayor.
Mr Kompany arrived in Belgium in 1975 as a refugee from what is now the Democratic Republic of Congo.
He became active in politics in 2006 as a councillor, and took a seat in the Brussels regional parliament in 2014.
But he is perhaps best known for his famous sons. Vincent Kompany is both the captain of English Premier League club Manchester City and a constant fixture on the Belgium national team. 
Vincent's brother, Francois, plays for Belgian side KSV Roeselare.
Both brothers were quick to congratulate their father in an Instagram post shared with Vincent's 1.6 million followers.
""History! We are so proud of you dad,"" he wrote.
 ‪History! We are so proud of you dad. Came over from the DR Congo, as a refugee, in 1975. Now gained the trust of your local community becoming the first ever black elected mayor in Belgium! It was long over due but it’s progress. Massive congrats! #Belgium #Brussels #Ganshoren ‬✊🏾

It's not the first time the football star has spoken about the need for progress in Belgian politics.
Two days earlier, he tweeted an image of the Belgian parliament, noting ""very little multiculturalism"" on display.
""That also reflects non-existent diversity at all levels of power in Belgium,"" he said.
Other mayoral candidates with mixed heritage have begun to enter politics in Belgium in recent years. Emir Kir, the son of Turkish immigrants, and was elected mayor of Saint-Josse in 2012; and Nadia Sminate, whose father was from Morocco, was elected the leader of Londerzeel in 2016.

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-australia-45943094,refugee,23 October 2018,None,Nauru migrants: Australia evacuates 11 children off detention island,"Some 11 children have been transferred to Australia from the Nauru detention centre to receive medical treatment.
They are the latest to be moved amid a mental health crisis on the island, which has long been plagued by allegations of human rights abuses.
The tiny Pacific island nation is the site of a controversial Australian processing centre for asylum seekers.
Australia has been criticised for holding child migrants who have mental heath issues on Nauru.
Doctors and human rights have called for all child migrants and their families to be evacuated from the island. Fifty-two children remain there, according to official figures.
The 11 children join more than 600 people in Australia on ""temporary transfers"" from offshore detention, reports say.
It is thought to be one of the largest groups to be transferred since offshore detentions began in 2013.
Under a controversial policy, asylum seekers intercepted while travelling to Australia by boat are banned from ever resettling there.
Home Affairs Secretary Michael Pezzullo said permanent asylum in Australia would not be granted to those transferred for medical treatment because it could encourage ""perverse behaviours"", including causing serious harm to instigate a transfer.
""Treatment in Australia is absolutely available for those who require it,"" he said on Monday.
People who have received medical transfers live with persistent uncertainty about whether they will be forced to return to Nauru, the UN's refugee agency has said.
Recent attention has focused on child migrants in the Pacific nation, who suffer from mental heath issues which have led to cases of self-harm, said the doctors' group, Médecins Sans Frontières.

Many of the children on the island have lived most of their life in detention, with no idea of what their future will be.
Some 652 people - including 52 children - are still left on the island, according to the latest official figures; they are made up of 541 refugees, 23 failed asylum seekers, and 88 people of undetermined status.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison is poised to lose his one-seat parliamentary majority after voters on Saturday shunned his ruling Liberal Party in a by-election.
Two independent MPs said on Monday their support for Mr Morrison's shaky government was tied to the fate of the child detainees on Nauru.
The Nauru detention centre was set up by Australia in 2013 in a controversial deal to house asylum seekers intercepted while trying to reach Australian shores by boat.
Australia says they will never be able to resettle in Australia, so over the years has sent many to privately run ""processing centres"" it funds on Nauru and in Papua New Guinea.
Canberra maintains its policy prevents deaths at sea and discourages people smugglers but the tough stance has been widely criticised.
In response to public pressure, Mr Morrison is reported to be considering taking up a long-held offer by New Zealand to accept 150 refugees.
The government has previously refused the offer, arguing it would be a ""back door"" for refugees to make it to Australia. 
It could soften its stance if new legislation is passed to limit the travel to Australia of refugees accepted by New Zealand, according to local media.

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-45910779,refugee,19 October 2018,None,Migrant caravan: Mexico sends police to southern border,"Mexico has sent hundreds of police to its southern border as a caravan of thousands of Central American migrants approaches from Guatemala.
The move came after President Donald Trump threatened to use military force to completely close the US-Mexico border over the issue.
He also said aid could be cut to countries allowing the caravan to pass.
The group of Salvadoreans, Hondurans and Guatemalans say they are fleeing violence and poverty. 
Mr Trump has previously threatened to cut Honduran aid. The US sent more than $175m (£130m) to the country in 2016 and 2017, according to the US Agency for International Development.
The president's threats also come just weeks before the mid-term elections on 6 November, which could see Democrats unseating Republicans in Congress. 
Mr Trump's recent comments are being viewed as an effort to bolster support among his base by cracking down on migration. 
By Will Grant, Mexico and Central America correspondent
Mexico's main reaction has been to step up security on its southern border with Guatemala. Hundreds of federal police officers and immigration officers have been sent to the porous border region along the Suchiate River which divides the two neighbours. 
In part, the response is intended to both dissuade the migrants from even attempting to enter Mexico and potentially to show the Trump administration that Mexico is willing to, as the government put it, ""maintain order"". 
Beyond that, this situation catches Mexico at a strange time. One administration, that of President Enrique Peña Nieto, is leaving office and the new one, of President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, isn't yet through the door.
Migrant caravans of this type are nothing new, they quite often take place. However, this one, coming as it does so close to the US mid-term elections in November, has taken on a highly political dimension, to that point that President Trump has threatened to use the military and close the US southern border.
The group of Central American migrants has made its intentions clear: they are heading to the US. 
Since he was on the campaign trail, Mr Trump has lambasted illegal immigrants, and this latest caravan comes after a major crackdown on migrants heading over the Mexican border. 
Changes to the way detention rules were implemented saw thousands of migrant children detained and separated from their parents earlier this year, sparking national and international condemnation.
The BBC's Anthony Zurcher in Washington says this isn't the first time Mr Trump has used an organised group of Central American refugees heading to the US to drum up support for his border security and immigration policies. In April, a previous convoy provoked similarly strong language from the president. 
Using the military to ""close"" the border could be disruptive in states like Texas and Arizona ahead of the mid-term elections. The move could also complicate relations between the US and Mexico, as Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador prepares to assume the Mexican presidency in December.
The migrant caravan is making its way through Guatemala, mostly on foot, with several of the quickest already at Mexico's southern border.
Their journey began in San Pedro Sula, Honduras, last week.
Most migrants are carrying few belongings, taking what they can carry in backpacks, as they head out on the nearly 2,800 mile (4,500km) trek.
Thousands of people and goods legally cross the US-Mexico border daily. 
While Mr Trump has sent national guard troops to the border before, it is unclear what he means by shutting it down entirely, and whether that would affect businesses or people with legitimate visas. 
And according to international law, the US cannot deport asylum seekers without first determining the validity of their claim.
Under pressure from the US to stop the migrants, Mexico has sent federal police to the border, though they are not officially there to stop the caravan.
Mexican officials said on Wednesday that those without papers would have to apply for refugee status or turn back.
US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo will be in Mexico this Friday, and US media report that he will discuss plans to stop the caravan.
The Associated Press reports that many migrants do not have passports and have been using national ID cards, which allow them to travel within Central America. Mexico, however, requires a passport at entry.
Human rights groups have criticised the US and Mexican response to the caravan.
Erika Guevara-Rosas of Amnesty International said in a statement: ""Mexican authorities should not take a Trump approach treating people like a security threat.""
""These families deserve dignity and respect to ensure that no one is illegally returned to situations where they could risk serious harm due to violence.""
Mexican president-elect Andrés Manuel López Obrador plans to offer work visas to Central Americans when he takes office in December.
""It is a plan that we have, that anyone who wants to work in Mexico will have a work visa,"" he said.
However, his incoming Foreign  Minister, Marcelo Ebrard, said those without a visa would have to apply for refugee status.
An estimated 10% of the population of Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras have fled danger, forced gang recruitment and dismal economic opportunities.
The region has one of the highest murder rates in the world. The UN reported murder rates in 2015 in Honduras standing at 63.75 deaths per 100,000 and El Salvador at 108.64 deaths.

http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-41459237,refugee,2 October 2017,None,Edmonton attack: Refugee arrested over 'terror' incident,"A Somali-born refugee has been arrested in connection with attacks in Edmonton, Alberta in which five people were injured, officials say.
The unnamed 30-year-old man is suspected of stabbing a policeman and injuring four pedestrians on Saturday.
The officer was controlling traffic at a Canadian Football League game when he was struck by a car at high speed and then attacked with a knife.
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has called it a ""terrorist attack"".
Edmonton officials say the suspect could face terror and murder-related charges. They add that he had been known to police for believing in extremist ideology. 
According to broadcasters CBC and CTV, a flag belonging to so-called Islamic State was found inside the vehicle that hit the police officer.
The officer and his vehicle were rammed by a car outside Alberta's Commonwealth Stadium on Saturday evening.
The driver then stabbed the uniformed officer several times, before fleeing on foot.  
Shortly before midnight, a man driving a rented van was pulled over at a checkpoint. His name on documents was said to be ""very similar"" to that of the man police were searching for.
The truck then fled the scene, and was pursued by officers. Four pedestrians were struck during the chase in what police say appeared to be a deliberate action. 
Two injured pedestrians have since been released from hospital and the police officer is recovering from his wounds.  
Mr Trudeau said he was both ""deeply concerned and outraged"" by ""this senseless act of violence"".
Edmonton Mayor Don Iveson urged calm.
""Terrorism is about creating panic and sowing divide about disrupting people's lives,"" he said. ""We can succumb to that or rise above it."" 
Jessica Murphy, BBC News, Toronto
Canada is not immune to the forces of extremism and has dealt with attacks before.  In January, a gunman entered a mosque in Quebec City and fired on worshippers, killing six. 
In 2014, gunman Michael Zehaf-Bibeau killed a soldier guarding a war memorial in Ottawa before driving to parliament, where he was eventually killed. 
A few days before, two soldiers were rammed by a car in Quebec province. The suspect was later killed by police. But one soldier was killed and another injured in what was described as an apparent act of home-grown terrorism. 
Canadians are again shaken by a suspected terror incident that is reminiscent of recent vehicle attacks in European cities like Barcelona, London, and Berlin.

http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-42178683,refugee,2 December 2017,By Gwyneth Rees,Syrian refugee in Narberth: 'Wales reminds me of home',"What surprised Safaa Batak most when she arrived in the UK to begin her new life was how much west Wales looked like the region of Syria where she grew up. 
""All the way from the airport, everything was very beautiful and I felt like I was seeing part of my country. 
""I was born in a place similar to here. The weather, the scenes, even the designs of the houses,"" she told BBC Radio Wales' Eye on Wales programme. 
""Even when we see people on the beach in Tenby, it is the same. We are used to tourists on the beaches in Syria. 
""It is not exactly the same but it is close. That's why I felt like it was my country.""
Perhaps this unexpected similarity is why Mrs Batak, 45, and her family have settled in so well. 
They live in Narberth, a market town in Pembrokeshire, and were among the first Syrian refugees to arrive under the government's Community Sponsorship Scheme, set up in July 2016.
It helps communities to offer new starts to refugees, including victims of Syria's six-year civil war.  
In the Batak's case, they spent four years as refugees in Egypt before being picked for the scheme and flying to Birmingham Airport in July, with all their belongings on four airport trolleys. 
When the Narberth group - Croeso Arberth - meaning Narberth Welcome - initially began the formidable task of offering to host a family, there was some concern they might not fit into their small town, with no mosque or real Muslim presence. 
But the opposite has proved true. 
The young men in the family regularly play five-aside with the locals and trips to the beach are frequent. 
And Mrs Batak's husband, Ahmad, too, is trying to improve his English by volunteering in a cafe.
He dreams of opening his own cafe with his brother, Huseen, 34.
Mr Batak, 49, said: ""I used to run a sweet factory in Damascus, while Huseen embroidered logos. 
""But now I go to the cafe to learn English and to learn ideas about cafes because this will be our next business.""
He said it was ""not nice"" sitting at home without work, adding: ""I want to give something back to the community.""
Mr Batak said he had also bonded with a man from Croeso Arberth over a universal issue - trying to quit smoking. 
When he arrived in the UK, Mr Batak smoked 40 cigarettes a day, largely due to the stress of the Syrian war. 
""Now, both this man and I haven't smoked for two and half months,"" he said.  
""I feel happy and healthier than before and I look about 10 years younger.""
To remind him of the birds he kept in Damascus, he also has chickens and doves in his garden. 
""If we could have some sheep that would be even better. I'm joking, I'm joking,"" he said, roaring with laughter. 
Mrs Batak has also settled in. 
Her English is developing, she has joined a knitting group and she is busy looking after her three children. 
She is also excited about becoming a grandma, with her 24-year daughter, Lamis, expecting her first child with her husband Ziad, 34.
But much of her happiness stems from the welcome of Croeso Arberth and the wider community. 
Before a family could be relocated, the group had to prepare a detailed plan of how all their needs would be met, such as housing, schooling, an interpreter and language support. 
And this support has continued post arrival, including help with trips to doctors and dentists.
Mrs Batak said it made them feel ""very comfortable"". 
In many ways, their life now is much the same as in Syria. 
""We go out and see people and friends,"" she said. ""We have school to learn English. We do the housework.
""The group takes us to see things and, of course, we like the beach. We are used to it. Is there anything nicer than the beach?""
The couple's son, Adnan, 14, has started school, where he is learning English and Welsh, after missing six years of education. 
And they hope their 19-year-old daughter, Falak, will soon be able to start college.
They even like the weather, describing the air as ""nice and fresh"". 
Of course, they are aware of how much they have lost - not only belongings but their ""nice, beautiful life"" in Syria. 
But at least they are safe. 
The only thing that scares them?
""It's the dogs and cats,"" Mrs Batak said. ""There are so many dogs when you go to Tenby. Our eldest daughter is vey scared of them.
""But apart from that, we are very, very happy.""
So far, 53 Syrians have arrived across Wales via the Community Sponsorship Scheme, with Croeso Arberth among the first schemes set up, with money raised largely through sponsored events and donations.  
In October, Narberth was presented with a human rights award by Liberty for its residents' efforts. 
There are other groups in Wales: Croeso Abergwaun (Fishguard), Croeso Teifi in Cardigan and Aberaid in Aberystwyth.
And more in Haverfordwest, Penarth, Cardiff, Dinas Powys, Barry, Newport, Anglesey, Llantwit Major and Cowbridge are on the way.
Citizens Cymru Wales - the community-organising charity helping to sponsor and train them - estimates about a third of all UK applications next year will come from Welsh communities.
Resettled families have the right to live in the UK for five years, before applying for indefinite leave to remain.
Elsewhere, the government is pledging to resettle 20,000 refugees by 2020.

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-45746222,refugee,8 October 2018,By Paul Adams,Will Trump's Palestinian policy work?,"""I want to say to Mr Trump that however much he talks about the 'deal of the century', Palestine will stay Palestinian.""
Liliane Samrawi, doesn't know what ""Palestine"" looks like. Neither does her father. Both were born in Bourj el-Barajneh, a Palestinian refugee camp next to Beirut airport.
""I'm 22 years old, and I don't know anything about my country.""
But ask Liliane where she is from, and she does not hesitate.
""I'm from al-Kabri.""
The village no longer exists. Or rather, the place on the map where it once stood is now a kibbutz (also called Kabri), east of the Israeli city of Nahariya.
It has been 70 years since al-Kabri was part of British Mandate Palestine. 
In 1948, 750,000 Palestinians fled or were driven from their homes in the fighting that surrounded the creation of the State of Israel. 
Only around 40,000 ""1948 refugees"" are still alive. The UN says they and their descendants now number more than 5 million. 
Bourj el-Barajneh has evolved, from a cluster of tents in the countryside to a densely packed, impoverished Beirut suburb. 
A spider's web of water pipes and electrical cables, wound together in lethal proximity, now spreads across the camp, obscuring the streets below.
Now the refugees who live here fear Donald Trump is trying to make them disappear altogether. 
In August, Washington ended its financial contribution to the UN Relief and Works Agency (Unrwa), which has been looking after Palestinian refugees since 1949. 
The cut of $350m amounted to around a third of Unrwa's annual budget. Other donors have made up some of the deficit, keeping the organisation's head above water, at least for now. 
Explaining the move, President Trump's ambassador to the UN, Nikki Haley, accused Unrwa of crying wolf and playing politics with the number of refugees.
""Every year they come and say 'the schools aren't going to open',"" Mrs Haley said, ""but they keep adding numbers of refugees to where we're never going to be able to sustain it.""
The US has not said how many refugees there should be, but questions whether descendants should be eligible. 
Unrwa officials reject the criticism.
""Unrwa does not inflate the number of refugees,"" the organisation's Lebanon director, Claudio Cordone, says.
Unrwa says 469,000 Palestine refugees are registered in Lebanon, but that only about 270,000 actually live there. 
Lebanon has never granted citizenship to the refugees. They are not allowed to own property or work in 36 specified professions, including medicine, law and engineering.
Over decades of unrelenting hardship, many refugees have left the country, pursuing new lives abroad. 
But the UN says that doesn't change who they are.
""Our definition of refugees is in fact in line with the general understanding of what is a refugee in the world. The UN High Commissioner for Refugees recognises descendants of refugees, and we follow exactly the same principle,"" says Mr Cordone.
The organisation says it is trying to avoid closing schools and clinics, but wage freezes and layoffs have already caused unrest among staff, including one-day strikes in the Gaza Strip. 
""Unfortunately… we're bearing the brunt of political decisions that have little to do with our humanitarian mission,"" Mr Cordone says.
The Trump administration's move against Unrwa follows a series of steps this year that have inflamed Palestinian opinion and generally pleased Israel.
In May, the US moved its embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, which fuelled protests and violence along the fence which separates Israel from the Gaza Strip. Israeli soldiers shot and killed 58 Palestinians. Israel says the soldiers acted in self-defence.
In September, the Trump administration closed the Washington DC offices of the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO), arguing that the PLO was refusing to engage in negotiations with Israel.
At the same time, US officials said the administration's long-awaited Middle East peace plan, dubbed ""the deal of the century"", would soon be unveiled. 
Is the Trump administration attempting to bludgeon Palestinians into submission?
""It's so clear that the Americans just want to put pressure on the Arab countries and Palestinians to make concessions,"" says Sari Hanafi, a Palestinian sociologist at the American University of Beirut.
He says he thinks the tactic will backfire.
""The Trump administration put the Palestinian issue into crisis, and this will translate into much more resistance and a more vivid Palestinian identity,"" he says.
In Lebanon, which offers the refugees no alternative, that identity still burns with fierce intensity.

http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-42073666,refugee,24 November 2017,None,Canada grants refugee status in about 60% of migrant cases,"Over half of the migrant asylum claims heard by Canadian refugee officials this year have been successful. 
New figures released by the federal Immigration and Refugee Board (IRB) show that of 1,572 claims heard so far, 941 have been granted. 
The IRB has a backlog of 12,895 cases currently pending.
Canada has seen a spike recent months of migrants crossing illegally into the country via the US and making asylum claims. 
The new figures look at claims received by the IRB from ""irregular border crossers"" between February and October of this year. 
Those made by migrants from Syria, Eritrea, Yemen, Sudan, Djibouti and Turkey were the most likely to be accepted. 
The IRB data confirms that Haitians are by far the biggest group of asylum seekers, filing 6,304 claims with the  refugee board over that period. 
However, of the small number of claims by Haitians processed so far, 298, only about 10% have been accepted. Failed claimants face removal to Haiti. 
The IRB notes that the new figures represent a small sample - 1,572 of 14,467 total claims - and that ""caution should be exercised in drawing conclusions regarding trends"". 
The Canadian Press reported that PM Justin Trudeau said on Thursday that Canada's refugee system is not meant for those merely seeking a better economic future but for those not being protected by their home country. 
Many Haitians had been living in the US for years but chose to seek asylum in Canada due to fears of deportation. 
The Trump administration hinted in May it would terminate a programme that gives over 50,000 Haitians in the US protection. 
It was officially scrapped this week. 
The programme grants temporary US visas to more than 435,000 people from 10 countries ravaged by natural disasters or war.
Canada is planning for another possible wave of migrants as a consequence of the policy change.
Canada completely lifted its own protected status for Haitians over a year ago.
In terms of numbers, Haitians migrants were followed by Nigerians, who have made 1,911 claims in Canada so far this year. 
The other top countries in order are Turkey, Syria, Eritrea, Yemen, the US, Sudan, Djibouti, and Pakistan. 
Canadian officials say US citizens included in the figures are mainly US-born children of migrants. 
IRB spokesperson Anna Pape said that refugee claims made by Americans are ""by and large dependents born in the USA and accompanying parents who are alleging persecution against a different country"". 
In total, 652 Americans have made refugee claims in Canada this year, including 366 who made claims at an official border crossing and those who came through illegally. 
Between 2013 and 2016, the numbers ranged from 69 to 129.

http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-41158703,refugee,5 September 2017,None,Myanmar conflict: Rohingya refugee surge hits Bangladesh,"The number of Rohingya refugees crossing from Myanmar into Bangladesh has surged, the UN says, with more than 35,000 new arrivals identified in the last 24 hours. 
More than 123,000 Rohingya are now said to have fled violence in Myanmar's Rakhine state since 25 August.
The conflict was triggered by an attack by Rohingya militants on police posts. 
This sparked a military counter-offensive that has forced a flood of Rohingya civilians from their villages. 
The Rohingya are a stateless mostly Muslim ethnic minority who have faced persecution in Myanmar (also called Burma). Many of those who have fled describe troops and Rakhine Buddhist mobs razing their villages and killing civilians in a campaign to drive them out.  
The military says it is fighting against Rohingya militants who are attacking civilians. 
Independently verifying the situation on the ground is very difficult because access is restricted, but since the police-post attacks Rohingya families have been streaming north into Bangladesh.  
The UN says it is not clear exactly when the latest refugees arrived, but said the number of new arrivals needing food and shelter had surged dramatically. 
Two main UN camps for them are now full, so people are sleeping outside or building shelters on open ground and along roads, a spokeswoman said. Many are in dire need of food and water. 
""We fled to a hill when the shooting started. The army set fire to houses,"" Salim Ullah, a farmer from Myanmar's Kyauk Pan Du village, told Reuters news agency as he arrived in Bangladesh. 
""We got on the boat at daybreak. I came with my mother, wife and two children. There were 40 people on a boat, including 25 women.""
The UN's migration agency has launched an appeal for $18m (13.9m) to provide ""life-saving services"" for the new arrivals. 
Meanwhile fighting appeared to be continuing in Rakhine, a UN situation report said, with smoke seen at at least 15 points close to the Bangladesh border. 
Thousands of Buddhist villagers in Rakhine are also reported to have fled south. One woman told  BBC Burmese she saw Rohingya militants attack people in her village with swords and ran for her life. 
The refugee surge comes amid mounting concern in Muslim nations over the plight of the Rohingya. 
""The security authorities need to immediately stop all forms of violence there and provide humanitarian assistance and development aid for the short and long term,"" said Indonesian Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi, who met Myanmar's de facto leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, on Monday. 
On Tuesday Ms Retno met Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who said the Rohingya influx was a ""big burden"" for Bangladesh and called on world leaders to put pressure on Myanmar to take them back. 
Indonesia is one of several nations where there have been protests over the Rohingya issue. Pakistan and Malaysia have spoken out, and the Maldives has suspended trade with Myanmar. The Turkish president called Ms Suu Kyi to raise concerns about human rights abuses, Turkish media said.    
Chechnya and Indian-administered Kashmir have seen protests and Kyrgyzstan has postponed an Asian Cup football qualifier with Myanmar, citing possible protests. 
On Monday, a senior UN human rights official said it was time for Ms Suu Kyi to step in to protect the Rohingya. 
Ms Suu Kyi, a Nobel Peace laureate who was under house arrest for years for her pro-democracy activism, has yet to comment on the latest violence. 
She is under growing pressure to condemn the army's campaign, but faces both a powerful military and a Burmese public largely hostile to the Rohingya. 
On Tuesday Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi arrives in Myanmar for an official visit, but the extent to which he will raise the issue is unclear. 
Last month, his government - which wants to boost economic and military ties with Myanmar - announced plans to deport India's 40,000 Rohingya refugees, because it says they are illegal migrants. 
However, finding a country to accept them will be very hard, because Myanmar does not consider them citizens and Bangladesh, which is already home to hundreds of thousands of displaced Rohingya, takes a similar view.

http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-41160013,refugee,6 September 2017,By Catrin Nye and Jessica Furst,The refugee doctors learning to speak Glaswegian,"Doctors who have travelled to Scotland as refugees are being given the chance to start working for the NHS through a training scheme. The BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme has been to meet those involved.
""When people say, 'I had a couple of beers', they don't mean two,"" jokes instructor Dr Patrick Grant, a retired A&E doctor training refugees to work for NHS Scotland - including in how to overcome cultural barriers.
One of his students is Fatema, who previously worked as a surgeon in the Middle East until she was forced to flee.
Having treated anti-government protesters in her home country, she herself had become a government target.
""I wish one day this country will be proud of me,"" she says.
Fatema is one of 38 refugees and asylum seekers on the course - a £160,000 programme funded by the Scottish government.
Based in Glasgow, it provides the doctors with advanced English lessons, medical classes and placements with GPs or hospitals.
The aim is to give the refugee doctors - who commit to working for NHS Scotland - the skills to get their UK medical registration approved.
Fatema says coming to the UK and not being able to work as a surgeon had felt like being ""handcuffed"".
""I'm a qualified medical doctor. It's hard to start again from zero,"" she explains.
Maggie Lennon, founder of the Bridges Programmes which runs the scheme, says it is important for the UK to utilise its high-skilled refugees.
""I always say to people, 'I imagine taking out an appendix in Peshawar is not that different to taking out an appendix in Paisley'.
""I don't think there's actually any difference in the clinical skills, I think where there is a huge difference is attitudes to patients and how medicine is performed,"" she explains.
The scheme is designed to overcome such hurdles, including the case of one surgeon who, Ms Lennon says, was unaware he would have to speak to patients, having previously only encountered them in his home country after they had been put to sleep.
Watch Catrin Nye's full film on refugee doctors on the Victoria Derbyshire programme's website.
Laeth Al-Sadi, also on the course, used to be a doctor in the Iraqi army.
He came to Scotland to study but his life was threatened in Iraq and he was never able to go back.
One of the ways he has learned to work with patients in the UK is to use informal terms that might put them at ease - ""How are the waterworks down there?"" being one example.
Language classes are an important part of the course, and placements with GPs and hospitals also allow the refugees to take note of local dialects.
Another doctor says he was confused by a patient who said they had a headache because of a ""swally"" - a term for an alcoholic drink.
Before refugees can even take their medical exams, they must pass tests to ensure they speak English at a high level.
They must pass a test called IELTS with a level of 7.5 - which even some doctors from the US and Australia have failed in the past.
All classes are taught in English. In one ""situational judgement"" lesson, the refugees are taught to assess what is wrong with a dummy patient based on its ""symptoms"".
Laeth says he feels lucky to be offered the possibility of a job in NHS Scotland.
""Lots of colleagues, or people who are doctors, are living here, and they are working other jobs.
""Some of them are even taxi drivers, which has [led to a loss of] hope for a lot of people.""
Ms Lennon says this issue of under-employment among the refugee population ""is as serious as unemployment"".
""If someone's a qualified accountant and they're working pushing trolleys [in a supermarket], then there is an argument that they're taking a job from a poorly qualified person in this country,"" she adds.
Fatema says that despite having to leave the Middle East, she is glad she took the decision to treat anti-government protesters.
""My promise at medical graduation [was to] treat people equally, and try to do whatever is possible to help people. So I would do it again.""
Dr Greg Jones, clinical lead at NHS Education Scotland, defended the use of government money on the scheme.
""As well as getting people back to their careers as doctors being the right thing to do from a humanitarian standpoint,"" he explains, ""it's also the right thing to do financially.
""It would be a hugely wasted resource if people who'd already gone through medical training were not used as doctors.""
Laeth says being part of the scheme allows him to feel like he ""belongs somewhere"".
""It means the world,"" he adds.

http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-australia-41924567,refugee,9 November 2017,None,Sydney Opera House scaled in Manus refugee protest,"Activists have scaled the Sydney Opera House to protest against Australia's treatment of asylum seekers in Papua New Guinea (PNG).
Australia held asylum seekers on PNG's Manus Island until last week when it closed a detention centre.
However about 600 of those men are refusing to leave, citing fears for their safety in the local community.
Five people were arrested in Sydney on Thursday after trying to unfurl signs calling for the men to be evacuated.
Police prevented the protesters from displaying a large banner. Smaller placards read ""evacuate Manus"" and ""Australia: world leaders in cruelty #BringThemHere"".
Under a controversial policy, Australia has detained asylum seekers who arrive by boat in detention camps on Manus Island and Nauru, a small Pacific nation.
Australia shut down the Manus Island centre last week after a PNG court ruled it was unconstitutional, urging asylum seekers to move to transit centres elsewhere on the island.
The government has steadfastly ruled out allowing the men into Australia, arguing it would prompt further human trafficking and lead to deaths at sea.
Asylum seekers on Manus Island say they fear violent attacks if forced to move to the transit centres, despite losing access to electricity and running water more than a week ago.
""This brutal policy [of offshore detention] has reduced us as a nation and a community,"" one activist who climbed the Sydney Opera House, Marco Avena, said in a statement.
""We act today in the interest of our own humanity not just the humanity of those left on Manus Island.""
The two men and three women arrested in Sydney were skilled climbers, according to a protest group calling itself the Whistleblowers, Activists and Citizens Alliance.
Police said they were questioning the protesters.
Activists from the group staged a similar demonstration on a crane near the Melbourne Cup, Australia's most prominent horse race, on Tuesday.
The UN's refugee agency has described the stand-off in PNG as an ""unfolding humanitarian emergency"". It says a majority of the men have refugee status.

http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-mid-wales-41859575,refugee,7 November 2017,None,Syrian refugee families to be housed in Llandrindod Wells,"Six families of Syrian refugees will join the 12 already resettled in Powys, under a new council proposal.
They would be the first to be placed in Llandrindod Wells, which was recently named the happiest place to live in Wales.
A  report to the council said there were concerns over long waiting lists for council houses in the town.
Powys council's cabinet decided to house the six families on Tuesday.
Ben Lloyd, Oxfam Cymru's campaigns and advocacy manager, welcomed the ""encouraging"" move. 
He said: ""The war in Syria is far from over, with over half of the population having fled their homes. 
""Indeed, in the first six months of 2017, more people had been displaced in Syria than the same period last year and September declared as the 'deadliest' month in Syria's near seven-year conflict, with 3,000 people losing their lives.
""This shows that it is crucial that we take in our fair share of refugees and Powys County Council is showing a good example of how the response can be stepped up here in Wales."" 
All councils in Wales have now resettled Syrian families with more than 400 people taken in under a UK government scheme, funded by the Home Office's foreign aid budget.
Half of the 12 families resettled in Powys since July 2016 are in Ystradgynlais with the remaining six in Newtown.
These towns were chosen due to their relatively lower rate of demand for three-bed accommodation. 
A report by councillor Jonathan Wilkinson said the families had been made to feel welcome and have arranged events to thank their new neighbours.
And a report into the success of the county's resettlement programme highlighted that all the Syrian families reported feeling safe and that they had progressed in learning English and gaining independence since arriving.
But the families raised concerns the English language lessons had been ""inadequate"" as they wanted to progress faster.
The council was ""unexpectedly surprised by the groundswell of support for the families"" and recommended a refugee charity be set up in the towns to help address the problems and consider recruiting a migration coordinator officer to work across the county.
Councillor Gary Price, of Llandrindod North, said ""families already living within the county have integrated well"" with the communities they live in. 
He added: ""My only concern is the availability of suitable housing within Llandrindod Wells for an additional six families, given regular contact from constituents who have been on the council and registered social housing waiting list for considerable time.
""It is important that Powys residents already on these waiting lists are not prevented suitable housing from any proposals within the cabinet report.""
Powys council said the process of housing the six additional families would begin ""as soon as possible"".

http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-australia-41826431,refugee,1 November 2017,None,"Manus Island: New refugee sites not ready, says UN","Some alternative accommodation for asylum seekers being held by Australia in Papua New Guinea is not yet fit to live in, the UN refugee agency says.
A senior official who visited the sites told Australia's ABC radio he found ""major earthworks in progress"".
Australia has held asylum seekers who arrive by boat on both Manus Island (in PNG) and Nauru, a small Pacific nation.
However, the Manus Island centre was shut on Tuesday after a PNG court ruled last year that it was unconstitutional.
Under its controversial policy, Australia refuses to take in anyone trying to reach its territories unofficially by boat. They are all intercepted and held in the Nauru and Manus Island detention centres. 
Nat Jit Lam, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) regional representative, said: ""I will not be bringing any refugee there to stay - not in that state.
""There was heavy machinery on the ground as well, there were no fences being constructed.""
Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said it made ""no sense"" for the detainees to remain in the centre when there was alternative accommodation, but Australia would not guarantee their safety in the local community.
About 600 men are refusing to leave for the temporary facilities in the town of Lorengau, saying they fear attacks by locals. They have lost access to running water and electricity, and their food supplies are dwindling.  
The men have dug holes in the ground and set up catchments to collect water but much of it is being stored in rubbish bins, one refugee told the BBC.
The former detainees say they are suffering from dehydration, starvation and anxiety.
Refugees told the BBC that PNG immigration officials arrived outside the centre on Wednesday, and they feared being forcibly removed
Detainees also reported that armed local residents looted the compound on Tuesday after security guards left.
Behrouz Boochani, a journalist and Iranian refugee who has been held on Manus Island since August 2014, wrote on Twitter that many of the men in the centre were physically and mentally unwell. 
Human Rights Watch has warned the men face ""unchecked violence"" from local people who have attacked them in the past with machetes, knives and rocks.
""They are terrified of moving. Further bloodshed is likely if they move to less secure facilities in the main town,"" Human Rights Watch Australia director Elaine Pearson said on Wednesday.
""We have been attacked several times already outside,"" Mr Boochani told the BBC. 
Nick McKim, an Australian senator currently on Manus Island, said he was witnessing ""a human rights emergency"". He said the facilities are not ready for habitation.
The Australian government has repeatedly said the men's safety is the responsibility of the PNG government.
""The PNG government is in charge of the law and order and security, and I understand they have this matter in hand,"" Ms Bishop said.
However, PNG has said it is Australia's responsibility to support them. The UNHCR has also repeated that claim.
Canberra has consistently ruled out transferring the men to Australia, arguing it would encourage human trafficking and lead to deaths at sea.
The refugees have been given the option of permanent resettlement in PNG, applying to live in Cambodia, or requesting a transfer to Nauru. Advocates say few have taken up these options.
Some men already in the temporary accommodation were ""comfortably accessing services and supports there"", Australia's Department for Immigration and Border Protection said on Tuesday.
A resettlement deal struck with the Obama administration in 2016 saw the US agree to take up to 1,250 refugees from the PNG and Nauru centres.
Last month, about 50 of them became the first to be accepted by the US under the deal. 
The agreement, which is being administered under the United Nations refugee agency UNHCR, is prioritising women, children and families and other refugees found to be the most vulnerable.
However, the US has not given an estimate of how long the application process will take, and it is not obliged to accept all of them.
Lawyers have filed a last-minute lawsuit in PNG saying the camp's closure breaches the detainees' human rights, which are enshrined in the PNG constitution. 
""The men are vulnerable to attacks and physical harm so we are seeking to ensure their constitutional rights are not breached and there is a resumption of the basic necessities of life,"" Greg Barns, a lawyer assisting with the legal action, told the BBC.
""The men have been dumped on the street, literally. What is going on is unlawful.""
The application also seeks to prevent the men's forcible removal to alternative centres on the island, and calls for them to be transferred to Australia or a safe third country.
Australia first opened Manus Island centre in 2001. It was closed in 2008 and re-opened in 2012.
Six asylum seekers have died since 2013, including Iranian man Reza Barati who was murdered during a riot.
Earlier this year, the government offered compensation totalling A$70m (£41m; $53m) to asylum seekers and refugees detained on Manus Island who alleged they had suffered harm while there.
The lawsuit alleged that detainees had been housed in inhumane conditions below Australian standards, given inadequate medical treatment and exposed to systemic abuse and violence.
The government called the financial settlement ""prudent"", but denied wrongdoing.

http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-40803432,refugee,9 August 2017,By Paul Moss,'Giving something back': Denmark's refugee entrepreneurs,"A new project in Denmark aims to help refugees start their own businesses, challenging the perspective, held by some, that they are a burden. But not everyone in the country is happy about the move.
I got to visit Noura Bittar at her home only after I promised to ignore the mess. 
She is a proud woman, and, in fact, her small flat in Copenhagen seemed pretty tidy, given that she runs a catering business from here, while also looking after a new-born baby.
And yet, it was easy to understand Noura's need to retain a sense of dignity. 
She fled to Denmark from the civil war in Syria, and is troubled by the way people often perceive those classed as ""refugees"".
""You have that stereotyping… that we came here to take their jobs and money. And I just want to say, 'No, that's not us.'""
Noura set out to dispel that image, despite still reeling from the fighting back in her home town of Homs, where friends were killed and close family members injured. 
She set up a catering business, hoping it would introduce more Danes to the cuisine of her homeland, while making her financially self-sufficient in the process. 
But even while she was building up the company, and not yet turning a profit, Noura began offering free cookery classes to Danish women who had been victims of rape or domestic abuse. 
""Danish society gave us security. It gave us a place to stay. I wanted to say thank you.""
Such gratitude is not always reciprocated. Opinion polls have shown a marked increase in the proportion of Danish people who want to stop refugees coming to their country. 
This antipathy has become particularly pronounced since 2015, when more than 20,000 people registered in Denmark as asylum seekers. 
Danish television screens were filled with images of bedraggled people dragging their worldly possessions along the motorway. 
Many had crossed the border from Germany, reckoning Scandinavia was a better bet for resettlement.
Watching this development was a young academic researcher, Conor Clancy. 
Mr Clancy is something of an ""immigrant"" to Denmark himself, born to an Irish father and an English mother.
He was doing a master's thesis on management and entrepreneurship, and came up with an idea that was, to say the least, going against the grain. 
He thought the new refugee arrivals should be seen as a resource, not a burden.
""Our research showed that when they're in the camps, [refugees] show a lot of entrepreneurial attributes,"" he says. ""They come with passion and drive.""
Mr Clancy formed Refugee Entrepreneurs Denmark, which helps new arrivals such as Noura to start their own business, supporting them with information, advice and general encouragement. 
He hopes this will enable refugees to become independent, no longer the ""burden"" some Danes seem to fear. 
And, more ambitiously, he believes these businesses will eventually create jobs that employ local Danes.
""This will put more tax into the system,"" he says, ""but also help break down the wall between refugees and their host nation.""  
Yet those walls are high, with many refugees struggling to fit into Danish society, according to another would-be entrepreneur I met, Khalid Jesri. 
He also fled here from Syria, and says at first, it was challenging to perform even the most basic tasks, let alone run a business.
""Refugees don't know how to take out the garbage, or how to pay bills,"" he says.
Khalid's solution was to create his own start-up, producing online information for refugees. 
With text and videos, his website teaches them how to navigate the contours of Danish society, including lessons about language and social etiquette, as well as practicalities, such as how to buy a train ticket. 
Like Noura, his own traumas are still raw. Khalid took seven months to reach Denmark from Syria, seeing fellow asylum seekers drown at sea along the way. 
And once again, at the heart of his project is a hope that refugees can become self-sufficient, or, better still, net contributors to the Danish economy.
""In Syria, we are accustomed to hard work,"" he says. ""We are not used to asking for any kind of support.""
Martin Henriksen believes refugees are already getting too much support. 
An MP for the nationalist Danish People's Party, he took me for a stroll round the Norrebro area of Copenhagen, where many refugees have settled. 
""A lot of people here have a different cultural background, religious background - they speak another language,"" he says, pointing out the number of homes with drawn curtains. 
He takes this as symbolic of separate lives that some foreign-born residents lead. 
The DPP came second in the last Danish election, on a platform of opposing immigration and the granting of asylum. Mr Henriksen rejects the idea that refugees can be a resource.
""The majority don't have the will,"" he says. 
Asked what he thinks of the Refugee Entrepreneur project, Mr Henriksen laughs and says he would not ban such ""voluntary work"". But he insists the refugees represent a problem, not a potential source of economic growth.
The Danish parliament will re-convene this autumn, at which point the DPP will put forward a motion to stop any new refugees from coming to the country. 
But Noura and Khalid seem undeterred, with plans to expand their businesses. 
Khalid in particular hopes his website might one day have versions in other countries where refugees have settled, giving them their own online learning tools to help them become net contributors in their adopted host nations too.

After their Aleppo home was destroyed by an air strike, most of his family made it to Wales and were given permission to stay.
But Mohammed Mirzo, 20, paid thousands of Euros to be smuggled in in a lorry. 
A Home Office spokesman said he must claim asylum in the first EU country he arrived in - which was Bulgaria. 
Mr Mirzo, whose family have set up the Royal Coast Cafe in Cardiff, said he fears being sent back to the eastern European country. 
He described being arrested in the country because his visa was about to run out, being beaten and having all his money and mobile phone taken off him.
""I was treated like an animal and given no food or drink,"" he said. 
After spending four days in prison, he made it to his brother's home in Germany about a year ago, where he started learning the language. 
But Mr Mirzo said he was beaten in a street attack and threatened with his life if he went to the police. 
Following this, he decided to try and rejoin the rest of his family in Wales and in Brussels paid 2,500 Euros (£2,233) to be smuggled to the UK. 
After 14 hours in the back of a lorry, he arrived in Bristol. 
""I went straight to the police and told them everything,"" he said. 
""I then saw my mother, father and family. I have suffered from everything and didn't ask for asylum in Bulgaria or Germany. 
""I'm not going back, it's what I'm fighting for.""
He wants to stay with his family, ""be a useful member of society"" and dreams of becoming a footballer.
But the Home Office spokesman said: ""The UK has a proud history of providing protection to those who need it.
""But it is only fair that we do not shoulder the burden of asylum claims that should rightly be considered by other countries.""
He added that where there is evidence an asylum seeker is the responsibility of another country, ""we will seek to return them there"".

The ""clear understanding"" had been part of a wider deal to resettle refugees in the US, the agency said.
It said Australia had recently backed out of that understanding. Australia has said no such promise ever existed.
The UN agency said Australia's long-held policy of detaining asylum seekers offshore had caused ""extensive"" harm.
Australia has controversially refused to accept asylum seekers and refugees, most of whom are men from Iran, Afghanistan and Iraq, and instead holds them in centres on the Pacific nations of Nauru and Papua New Guinea.
The government has said its policy disrupts people smuggling and prevents deaths at sea.
On Monday, the UN high commissioner for refugees (UNHCR), Filippo Grandi, said Australia had only recently confirmed that it would not take refugees with existing close family ties.
""This means, for example, that some with serious medical conditions, or who have undergone traumatic experiences, including sexual violence, cannot receive the support of their close family members residing in Australia,"" he said.
However, the Australian government denied it had offered to accept any of the refugees, saying its policy had been ""clear and consistent"".
""Those transferred to RPCs [regional processing centres] will never settle in Australia,"" a government spokesperson told the BBC.
Under existing agreements, refugees have the possibility of settling only in Nauru, Papua New Guinea, the US, Cambodia, or another nation where they are eligible to live.
Mr Grandi said reuniting families was ""the humane and reasonable thing to do"".
""The Australian government's decision to deny them this possibility is contrary to the fundamental principles of family unity and refugee protection, and to common decency,"" he said.
Many people had suffered ""physical and psychological harm"" since Australia introduced its current policy in 2013, he added.
In April, the US confirmed it would go through with a deal to resettle up to 1,250 refugees - which Australia had arranged with the Obama administration.
US President Donald Trump had called the deal ""dumb"" following a phone call with Australian PM Malcolm Turnbull.

Khalbibi Uzbeki, who is bedridden and nearly blind, is believed to be the oldest person to have sought asylum in Europe.
""I couldn't go to Afghanistan, security isn't good and there are not health services for my needs,"" she said.
The migration court said it had ruled on humanitarian grounds.
""... It would be shocking to require her to travel to her home country,"" the court in the city of Gothenburg added.
Its decision overruled the rejection of Ms Uzbeki's asylum request by the Swedish Migration Board in May.
Ms Uzbeki travelled to Europe in 2015, and was carried across mountains and deserts by her son and grandson, AP news agency reported.
However her other family members are still waiting to see if their asylum requests will be granted, her grandson Mohammad Uzbeki told the BBC.
""We are all very happy for the decision but just to highlight she is one of our 12-member family in Sweden that got a positive decision, the remaining 11 of us are all in state of limbo, some refused and others yet to be determined,"" Mr Uzbeki said.
The Gothenburg migration court noted Ms Uzbeki's age, health and ""especially vulnerable situation"" in making its decision.
It means Ms Uzbeki now has temporary residency for 13 months and can then apply for an extension.
The Swedish Migration Board does not comment on individual cases but told Svenska Dagbladet newspaper that ""in general, advanced age is not a reason to be granted protection"".
The migration board also says the conflict in Afghanistan ""has not reached such a level that every Afghan can obtain a residency permit"".
Sweden saw 160,000 people mainly from the Middle East and Afghanistan arrive in 2015, more per capita than any other country in Europe and far more than officials had predicted.
It has since introduced restrictions and last year saw 30,000 arrivals.

Abdulahi Hasan Sharif, 30, also faces dangerous driving and weapons possession charges. 
Five people, including a uniformed police officer, were injured in the Saturday night incident. 
Authorities said the suspect could still face terror-related charges but none have yet been laid. 
Mr Sharif had been known to police for believing in extremist ideology. 
A flag belonging to so-called Islamic State was found inside the vehicle that hit the police officer.
On Saturday evening, Constable Michael Chernyk was rammed by a car outside Alberta's Commonwealth Stadium. 
The driver then stabbed the officer several times, before fleeing on foot.  
Shortly before midnight, a man driving a rented U-Haul van was pulled over at a checkpoint and police recognised the name on the rental documents as similar to those for the car that struck Constable Chernyk. 
The truck fled the scene, and was pursued by officers. Four pedestrians were struck during the chase in what police say appeared to be a deliberate action. 
Two injured pedestrians remain in hospital, one in serious condition. 
Constable Chernyk, is recovering from his wounds.  
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau called it a ""terrorist attack"" and said he was both ""deeply concerned and outraged"" by ""this senseless act of violence"".
On Sunday evening, hundreds of people attended an anti-violence vigil in Edmonton organised by the Alberta Muslim Public Affairs Council. 
Mr Sharif is due to appear in an Edmonton court on 3 October. He will be formally charged with a total of 11 counts, including the attempted murder charges.

The Tamil man, 32, died in a suspected suicide after receiving treatment for mental illness, refugee advocates said.
Australia controversially holds refugees and asylum seekers who arrive by boat in centres on PNG's Manus Island and the Pacific nation of Nauru.
Nine detainees have died since 2013 - including six at the Manus centre, which is due to close this month.
The latest death - the apparent suicide of a refugee - happened in Lorengau General Hospital early on Monday, Manus Island police commander David Yapu told the BBC.
In a brief statement, Australian authorities said they were ""aware of the death"" and directed questions to PNG.
In August, an Iranian asylum seeker, Hamed Shamshiripour, was also found dead on Manus Island.
Australia has said the centre will close by 31 October after a PNG court ruled it was unconstitutional to detain people there.
Last month, the US accepted the first of up to 1,250 refugees under a resettlement deal. Washington may ultimately approve fewer than that after vetting, and Australia has not said what will happen to those left behind.
In September, Canberra agreed to pay A$70m (£40m; $55m) to refugees and asylum seekers who said they had suffered mental and physical harm in detention.
Australia has frequently defended its offshore policy against criticism by maintaining it prevents deaths at sea and discourages people smugglers.

Jeffrey Barry, 56, attacked Kurdish refugee Kamil Ahmad in his Bristol flat on 6 July 2016.
Bristol Crown Court heard that Mr Barry had previously phoned police claiming Mr Ahmad was a rapist and a terrorist.
Mr Barry, who has paranoid schizophrenia, denies murder but admits manslaughter by diminished responsibility.
A post-mortem examination found Mr Ahmad's body had been severely mutilated during the attack, with his penis being cut off after he died.
The court was told Mr Barry had been racist towards Mr Ahmad in the past and had previously assaulted him in December 2013.
The pair both lived in a supported housing unit for adults in Wells Road.
Adam Vaitilingam QC, prosecuting said the attack happened after Mr Barry knocked on Mr Ahmad's door.
""[Mr Ahmed] was immediately subjected to a savage and sustained attack by the defendant, who was carrying a knife,"" he said.
""The defendant had taken a dislike to Kamil Ahmad long before he killed him.""
He said Mr Barry had written notes stating his intention to kill people in the shared accommodation block.
On 24 May last year, he is reported to have told support workers he wanted to be ""notorious and murder a member of the public"", allegedly adding: ""Kamil would be top of my list.""
On the night of the killing Mr Barry was seen on CCTV knocking on Mr Ahmad's door at 01:30 BST. Later footage showed him exiting the flat, covered in blood, at 02:15 BST.
He then dialled 999 saying he had killed Mr Ahmad. Psychiatrists disagree on whether Barry had paranoid schizophrenia when he killed Mr Ahmad, the court heard.
The trial continues.

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-45955975,refugee,24 October 2018,None,US watchdog: Agencies 'unaware' of child separation policy,"US government agencies were blindsided by the White House's policy to separate families caught illegally crossing the border, reports a government watchdog.
The Government Accountability Office discovered the agencies tasked with enforcing the policy in April ""did not plan"" for an influx in jailed children.
The ""zero tolerance"" policy saw nearly 3,000 migrant children separated from parents before it was suspended.
The report comes as a caravan of nearly 7,000 migrants seek refuge in the US.
The new findings were released to the public on 24 October, though the report had been published on 9 October.
Congressional investigators with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) interviewed officials from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).
They found that these agencies had not planned for the increase in children separated from parents or guardians as a result of the ""zero tolerance"" policy, because they were unaware the policy was forthcoming.
""These officials told GAO that they were unaware of the memo in advance of its public release,"" the report - which was requested by House Democrats - states. 
""Prior to April 2018, DHS and HHS did not have a consistent way to indicate in their data systems children and parents separated at the border.""
In April and July, border officials and the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) were able to update databases to mark separated children, according to the report.
However, GAO notes that it is too soon to know if those changes ""will consistently indicate when children have been separated...or will help reunify families"".
As of 10 September, 437 children remain in ORR custody ""for various reasons, such as ineligibility for reunification"", GAO reported.
Katie Waldman of DHS told the BBC in an emailed statement that both DHS and HHS ""have worked tirelessly"" towards reunification but did not comment on specifics in the report.
A justice department spokesperson told CBS News it was ""not very credible"" to say DHS was ""unaware"" of the policy as Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced it at a news conference alongside acting Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Director Thomas Homan.
Immigration activists have long claimed that there was no official protocol in place to track parents and their separated children, which led to major difficulties in identifying children in government custody. 
Some government officials even suggested DNA tests during the thick of the separation crisis, which some critics took as proof that there had been no clear policy in place.
The ""zero-tolerance"" policy meant adults illegally crossing the border, even if they were asylum-seekers, were placed in custody and faced criminal prosecution for illegal entry. 
As children cannot legally be jailed with their parents, migrant children were separated and housed in detention centres, in the custody of HHS.
But activists at the border said that even families crossing through a port of entry were being targeted.
Under previous US administrations, immigrants caught crossing the border for the first time tended to be issued with court summonses and released.
In June, amid fierce criticism across the country and worldwide, President Donald Trump backed down on the policy and signed an executive order to ""keep families together"".
Of the 1,500 migrants who arrived in the last caravan, only about 250 are legally still in the US, humanitarian organisation Pueblos sin Fronteras told CBS News.
And now, a second caravan of Central American migrants is making its way northward.
The president has lashed out against the migrants and their home countries, threatening to cut all aid and use military force to close the US border.
The migrants, mostly from Honduras, say they are fleeing poverty and violence. Most are still hoping to seek asylum in the US.
Under Mr Trump's June executive order, families caught crossing illegally can remain together in detention, but children are only allowed to be held for 20 days, according to a 21-year-old landmark court decision known as the Flores agreement.
DHS spokeswoman Ms Waldman told the BBC in a statement that the department would continue to refer illegal immigrants for prosecution.
""Unfortunately, the number of families crossing the south-west border illegally is increasing. This means that there may be a proportional increase in cases where adults are separated from children due to concerns about parentage or the adult's criminal history.""
Ms Waldman said that DHS had seen a 75% increase in family apprehensions since 2016 and a 315% increase in families trying to illegally enter the US.

http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-41407320,refugee,26 September 2017,By Robbie Meredith,Cash for refugee schoolchildren not received by schools,"Northern Ireland has not received any of the money needed to educate Syrian refugee children for more than a year.
The Syrian Vulnerable Persons Relocation Scheme (SVPRS) was established by the UK government to support refugees.
As part of the scheme, £4,500 was to be provided towards each Syrian child's education costs for one year.
But the Department of Education (DE) told the BBC no such money has been received by them since August 2016.
Of the 632 Syrian refugees who have settled in Northern Ireland since December 2015, 245 are school-aged children.
Dr Seamus Quinn is the principal of St Patrick's in Lisburn, which has five Syrian pupils.
He said some of the children had been in refugee camps for five years and had arrived in Northern Ireland illiterate in Arabic and with no knowledge of the English language.
""I don't know who's responsible, I don't know who should be doing that, but if the money was promised surely it should be provided to educate the children,"" he said.
Frank Maskey is the principal of Corpus Christi College in west Belfast, which has 30 Syrian refugees as pupils.
""We need to find out who is responsible and we also need to find out why it happened and how it happened,"" he said.
""But most importantly, we need to get that money and get that money into the system so we can get the best support possible to those children who deserve it.""
DE did not give a reason why there had been no education funding through SVPRS for Syrian pupils settled here since August 2016.
DE said that the funding arrangements for Northern Ireland for the scheme were governed by a memorandum of understanding between the Home Office and the Executive Office.
They said that the memorandum of understanding was being revised, and that payments for 2017/18 would be made following final agreement on that.
However, they did not specify when that would be.

The bag was left on a U-Bahn (subway) train last Friday night by a 78-year-old woman. 
Moments after leaving it, she realised her mistake and told train authorities, but they were unable to trace the bag.
It had been found by a 16-year-old Iraqi student, who told her mother. Two days later they handed it in.
On Tuesday, Berlin police tweeted their praise: 
""A student found a handbag with €14,000 and handed it over to police. The owner is happy. We say excellent and thank you,"" it said.
The family, who live in a refugee centre, are likely to receive a reward for their honesty, say German media.
Under German law, the applicable reward is three percent for objects or money turned in - though this is halved if the valuables are found on public transport. That would leave the family with a €210 reward.

Veljko Aleksic died in 2014, aged 91, but the hand-written will he wrote two years earlier was littered with spelling mistakes and smudges.
Friends, charities, church authorities and a forensic document examiner were used to interpret what he meant.
Judge Paul Matthews said ""bad English can still make a good will"".
Mr Aleksic was born in Montenegro in 1923, and began working in a quarry when he arrived in Britain soon after World War Two. 
He was one of seven children. But only one brother survived him and he died with no children of his own.
During his 70 years in the UK, he came to own houses in Cardiff, north London and Montenegro, as well as a portfolio of bonds and shares.
Although Mr Aleksic was a British citizen, he never obtained a good command of English.
His close friend Stanka Breben, also from Cardiff, was determined that his wishes be honoured.
After hearing the evidence, Judge Matthews decided that the majority of Mr Aleksic's fortune should go to the Serbian Orthodox Church in London.
He ruled that the money must be spent on ""people in need, especially children, in Kosovo.""

Mohammed Hassan, 17, died on 1 April on an industrial estate in Banbury.
Oxford Coroner's Court heard he was killed when the HGV he had been clinging to reversed over him.
Coroner, Darren Salter, said the Home Office would be contacted over concerns about how UK Border Agency dealt with Mr Hassan four days earlier in France.
Crash scene investigator Gary Baldwin said Mohammed Hassan must have ""either deliberately or accidentally emerged from the axle area"" as the lorry stopped in Banbury, and was run over when it started reversing.
PC Sandra Terry said the driver had gone to the wrong entrance of a factory belonging to plastic injection moulding firm Magna and was trying to correct his mistake.
Oxfordshire Coroner Darren Salter said he had switched on his hazard warning lights and did not see the teenager in his mirrors.
Mr Hassan had been detained by the UK Border Agency on 28 March when he was discovered in the back of a lorry with four other Iraqis in Dunkirk. He was handed over to French police.
Mr Salter said ""These are UK agencies who are exercising jurisdiction and in this case detaining a child, an unaccompanied child.
""They have responsibilities as a result... There is a significant question about what the staff are trained to ask."" 
Crash scene investigator Gary Baldwin told the inquest that the space on top of the lorry axle would have been a ""very uncomfortable place to be"" and he could not think of ""a more difficult thing to do"" especially given the temperature had been almost freezing.
The Romanian driver told police he heard a bump and then saw a body in front of the lorry. 
""I pulled him from the ground, I didn't know what to do,"" he said.
Mr Salter said the teenager was pronounced dead at the scene and died from ""severe crush injuries"".
He had travelled from the Kurdish region of Iraq, via Greece and Germany, without telling his parents who thought he was going to Turkey.
The inquest heard how Mr Hassan told friends he wanted ""a new life in the UK"" and was afraid so-called Islamic State would kill his family if they stayed in Iraq.
Mr Salter said he had travelled to Dunkirk and intended to claim asylum in the UK with the hope of bringing his family over to join him.
Mr Hassan's uncle Shamal Silah said he had been ""shocked"" listening to the evidence and his family were still grieving the loss.
He said: ""We lost one of our family, we don't want to lose any other people this way.
""There is no one looking after [the children] and helping them. No one showing them the right way.""

The exhibition called Dispersing the Night was created by Brazilian sculptor Ana Maria Pacheco who said the sculptures illustrate the suffering of exile, migration and displacement.
At the centre, a young man carries an older man on his back, with 10 figures reacting in the shadows.
The exhibition can be seen on display until 23 July.
Jacquiline Creswell, from Salisbury Cathedral, said the themes of the exhibition were ""hope, an optimistic attitude, and a firm belief in the positive side of human nature"".
""Ana Maria's work makes us aware of our vulnerability as well as illuminating our humanity,"" she said.
""It allows us to reflect on the way we frail, brave humans deal with our journey of life, its many contradictions and dimensions of reality - the imperfectability of existence.""
Ana Maria Pacheco said she had been inspired by Virgil's ancient poem The Aeneid, in which a Trojan Aeneas carries his lame father on his back, leading refugees from the burning ruins of Troy.
""The shadows, the figures in the black, belong to the night; they are the memories that we carry within us in the depths of our mind,"" she said.
""The two leading figures, the father and son, are on their way to a new horizon, a new life, leaving the catastrophe of war behind them.""
The art work has previously been on display at Chichester Cathedral and her prints are held at the Tate gallery in London.

Donald Trump says whoever ordered the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi ""should be in big trouble"", adding: ""The cover up was the worst in the history of cover-ups."". Mr Khashoggi - a US resident and prominent critic of the Saudi government - disappeared after visiting the Saudi Arabian consulate in Istanbul. The Saudi authorities' version of events has shifted over time, but they now say he was murdered in a ""rogue operation"".
The US has promised a strong response, but is seen by some as having diluted that by stressing Saudi Arabia's importance as an ally. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, though, told reporters in Washington he and Mr Trump were ""making very clear that the United States does not tolerate this ruthless action"", and had revoked the visas of some of those it thinks were responsible.
Earlier on Tuesday, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said the journalist's murder was premeditated.

With Brexit talks stalled, plans for no-deal are ramping up. There are fears about the possible imposition of tighter border checks on the flow of key goods like medicines, and now ferry and freight firms are being urged to plan alternative routes via Belgian and Dutch ports if - as feared - the crossing between Dover and Calais becomes clogged up.
The advice emerged after what we're told was a ""passionate"" cabinet meeting looking at worst-case scenarios. BBC Newsnight's political editor Nick Watt says ministers discussed the possibility that there could be a 75-80% drop-off in traffic across the Calais-Dover route. A senior government source, though, denied reports that there were any plans to buy or charter vessels to guarantee supplies.
It comes as a warning is issued by a government watchdog that new UK border controls may not be ready in a no-deal situation and the hundreds of new staff necessary not recruited in time. What else could no-deal mean? We've broken it down.
The BBC has uncovered new evidence that China is locking up hundreds of thousands of Muslims without trial. Satellite imagery reveals a number of large prison-type structures that have been built across the western region of Xinjiang in the past few years. Local people in a town close to one referred to it as ""a re-education school"" - one said people sent there ""have some problems with their thoughts"". 
China denies the claims, saying people are willingly attending special ""vocational schools"" which combat ""terrorism and religious extremism"".

You spend hours in traffic ferrying yourself and your children around because your estate has no shops; no pub; no doctor; no school; no jobs.

The Lincolnshire Refugee Doctor Project said it hoped to train up to 10 medics in the first recruitment phase.
They would be given the language help and professional mentoring required for them to work in the NHS, it said. 
A national shortage of doctors has caused staffing issues at United Lincolnshire Hospitals NHS Trust, which has been placed in special measures. 
More on this and other stories across Lincolnshire
The charity-led project is aimed at supporting refugee doctors back into medical practice in the UK.
NHS doctors must be registered with the General Medical Council (GMC) to work in the UK.
In order to do so they must pass strict English language, linguistic and clinical tests set by the GMC.
Middlesbrough has piloted a similar NHS scheme to recruit refugee doctors. 
Dr Jane Metcalf, deputy medical director at the University Hospital of North Tees, which has been involved with the pilot, said the resettlement programme for overseas doctors was primarily a humanitarian project but it also helped the trust meet its recruitment needs.
""It's a win-win situation,"" she said.
The Lincolnshire Refugee Doctor Project said because recruitment into the medical profession had decreased at the same time as there had been a rise in the number of medics leaving, there had never been a greater need for doctors to be recruited.
Andrew Mowat, chairman of the project, said there were up to 600 refugee doctors currently known to the British Medical Association and who were not working in the NHS.
He said: ""We're hoping to recruit from among them and bring them to Lincolnshire and provide the necessary training.""
Mr Mowat said the project would ensure doctors were given help with both personal and professional issues such as accommodation, claiming benefits and settling into life in Lincolnshire.

The commission, the EU's executive body, accused the three countries of ""non-compliance with their legal obligations on relocation"".
The Luxembourg-based ECJ could impose heavy fines.
A relocation plan was launched by the EU in 2015 in response to a large influx of migrants and refugees.
The move was an attempt to relieve pressure on Greece and Italy where the vast majority of migrants were arriving.
However, the Czech Republic has accepted only 12 of the 2,000 asylum-seekers it had been designated, while Hungary and Poland have received none.
The commission launched infringement procedures against the three states in June and warned them last month that further action was likely.
""The replies received were again found not satisfactory and three countries have given no indication that they will contribute to the implementation of the relocation decision,"" a statement said.
""This is why, the commission has decided to move to the next stage of the infringement procedure and refer the three member states to the court of justice of the EU.""
Following Thursday's announcement, Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis told the BBC his country would continue to oppose the relocation scheme.
He said the quota system had fuelled anti-migrant sentiment and played into the hands of the far right.
Poland's Deputy Foreign Minister Konrad Szymanski also said his government was ""ready to defend its position in the court"".
In 2015 EU states agreed to relocate 160,000 asylum-seekers between them based on the size and wealth of each country, however, Romania, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary voted against accepting mandatory quotas. 
Separately, the commission is also taking Hungary to the ECJ over its laws on higher education and NGOs.
Hungary's right-wing government is looking to pass a higher education law that could close the Central European University, founded by financier and philanthropist George Soros.
Mr Soros has a strained relationship with Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban.
The commission said Hungary's education law ""disproportionally restricts EU and non-EU universities in their operations and needs to be brought back in line with EU law"".
Hungary also caused controversy in June when it passed legislation forcing non-governmental organisations to declare themselves ""foreign-funded"".
The commission said the laws ""indirectly discriminate and disproportionately restrict donations from abroad to civil society organisations"".

A total of 24 families have been rehomed on the island since December 2015.
Argyll and Bute Council was one of the first Scottish local authorities to respond to the humanitarian crisis in Syria.
A report to councillors said there were now 70 Syrians living on Bute, with more births due soon.
The island of Bute has a total population of about 6,500.
Five of the Syrian families re-homed there have since moved to England to be nearer other relatives, leaving 19 families resident on Bute.
One new family is also due to arrive later this month.
An update report for councillors, prepared by the council's business improvement manager, Morag Brown, said: ""At October 31, 2017, there are 19 refugee families resettled on Bute under the VPR (Vulnerable Persons Relocation) scheme.
""This equates to 70 individuals in total; 18 men, 19, women, 20 boys and 17 girls and four babies born since arriving in the UK. There are more babies due to be born in the next few months.""
All the children over three years old attend Rothesay Joint Campus school and there are now 28 Syrian pupils at the school with six in the pre-5 unit, 13 in the primary and nine in secondary.
Nine Syrian children have attended the Rothesay Playgroup.
The report praised the way the youngsters had been welcomed.
""The involvement of the school has very much been at the heart of the response and the support to the families, reflecting the school's role in the community and acknowledging that the decisions our families made to come to the UK were to afford their children a safer and better life,"" it said.
The benefit of volunteering to increase the chances of the refugees finding employment was highlighted in the report.
It said: ""This year we have had significant uptake in volunteering opportunities by our women, with five now volunteering in the community on a weekly basis.
""The women are volunteering in care and childcare settings where they are developing skills which will lead to employment in the future.
""The women do not appear to have the same barriers with language to volunteering as some of the men do. However, that said, many of the men once again volunteered at this summer's Butefest and several have volunteered at a local charity.""
The report said the community on Bute continued to be ""welcoming and supportive"" to the refugee families.
It added: ""Many friendships have now developed with the local indigenous community and the new Syrian families, especially with the children. 
""Those interviewed said the island was their home now and they are very grateful for all the support the local community gives them.""

The human rights campaigner Bianca Jagger said she was calling for people ""to think about what we are facing with a President in the US who wants to belittle women, who wants to reduce all rights"".

Petra Laszlo had been sentenced to three years' probation for her actions by a lower court.
But the country's top court ruled on Tuesday that she should have been charged with a misdemeanour not a criminal offence, and cleared her.
It said that her actions - which attracted international attention - were ""morally incorrect and illicit"".
But, it said, with reference to the ""disturbance"", her actions were not severe enough to be classed as criminal.
In the incident at the Hungary-Serbia border in September 2015, migrants and refugees had broken through a police barrier.
In footage from the scene, Ms Laszlo appeared to kick a young girl and trip up a father carrying a small boy.
At the time, large numbers of people, many fleeing violence in the Middle East, were trying to reach western Europe via countries such as Hungary.
The camerawoman had been working for the right-wing Hungarian TV channel N1TV, which fired her after the footage went viral.
The father and son seen in the footage later obtained asylum in Spain, where the man was offered work as a football coach.

http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-40879544,refugee,9 August 2017,None,Canada military builds refugee camp for refugees from US,"The Canadian military is building a camp to house the growing number of refugees crossing the US border, officials have said.
The camp would house up to 500 asylum seekers in Saint-Bernard-de-Lacolle, Quebec, near Plattsburgh, New York.
The construction begins about a week after Montreal turned its Olympic Stadium into a shelter for refugees arriving from the US.
More than 3,300 people crossed into Quebec between 1 January and 30 June.
The military-built camp would house hundreds of asylum seekers in heated tents fitted with flooring and electricity while they wait for their refugee applications to be processed, said a statement from the military.
Patrick Lefort, a spokesman for the Canada Border Services Agency, told the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation there was currently a backlog of asylum seekers at Roxham Road, a popular crossing point near Saint-Bernard-de-Lacolle, Quebec.
It will take about two or three days for Canada Border Services to process the 700 asylum applications. In the meantime, there is no place for them to stay.
Francine Dupuis, of Praida, a provincial programme for the reception and integration of asylum seekers, told the BBC that another 1,200 people crossed into the province in July, about 90% of them from Haiti.
In May, Donald Trump announced that the US would end the programme that extended temporary protection to Haitian citizens after the devastating 2010 earthquake. That protection is due to expire in January 2018.
Since then, many asylum seekers have tried to get refugee status in Quebec, a French-speaking province.
No such protection exists in Canada, where the assessment is done case-by-case.
Haiti sent two government officials to meet the Quebec government on Tuesday, to discuss the situation.
Montreal's Olympic Stadium is being used as a shelter during August, and the city also plans to use the decommissioned Royal Victoria Hospital as a 320-bed facility. 
School-aged refugees will be enrolled at Montreal's French-language school board beginning next month.

It is thought he is an asylum seeker who joined Stoke High School, Ipswich, as a new pupil at the start of term. 
The school said it had contacted the Home Office in relation to the concerns but it was not prepared to comment further.
Another pupil shared an image on social media with the message: ""How's there a 30-year-old man in our maths class?""
But some classmates from the school said they did not think he was as old as 30 and suggested he had been a victim of bullying.
The Home Office said it does not routinely comment on individual cases.
In a statement the school said: ""This is a matter for the Home Office. They are looking into this after we contacted them. 
""We do not comment on individual cases but we have followed government and local authority policies and guidance, as we do for any asylum admissions matter.""
It added the pupil ""was not attending the school at this time"". 
The government's criteria for granting asylum to refugees are:
Lewis Forte, whose step-daughter is a pupil at Stoke High School, said he had been totally dissatisfied with the school's response.
He added: ""I went to the school to raise concerns about it and the teacher tried to shut me down by saying all his documents were present and correct which they probably were.""
Mr Forte said he believed the pupil in question had been at the school since the start of the term.
""If he is a child then I am very sorry but I had a few children in my class who looked old for their age but this is something else,"" he added.
Another parent warned others on social media: ""I suggest if anyone's children are in the same classes as this guy then keep them off school until this has been investigated.""
Victoria Newby, who has a child at the school, said: ""My girls will not be attending until I know for sure he's been removed.""
But mother-of-three Victoria Thorpe said she would not be taking her 11-year-old son out of the school.
She said: ""It's not the school's fault, they are in a hard position.
""I'm not going to take my son out because it would affect his education and because he's in Year 7 he's not going to be around him too much.""
Ipswich MP Sandy Martin said parents should not be taking their children out of the school, as they are not at risk.
""Stoke High School is, as far as I am concerned, an extremely safe environment for their children,"" the Labour MP said.
""It's not the school's fault, it's the Home Office's. They are responsible for making sure that people are sent to appropriate places.""
The East Anglian Daily Times reported that parents suspected the ""man"" had lied about his age in order to gain GCSEs because his qualifications were not recognised in England.

Sophie Congdon, 21, from Cardiff, is part of a group called Sew-Ho who make clothes for migrants in the camp.
Volunteers say it gives people much-needed clothing, amid claims refugees' belongings are ""hacked up"".
Pas-de-Calais officials insist police ""follow strict ethical codes"".
Sew-Ho receives daily donations of old and damaged clothing to a warehouse in Calais.
University of Hertfordshire student Ms Congdon is one of a team working together to make essential items out of what they can, creating drawstring bags and waterproof ponchos out of old tents.
Ms Congdon said that despite the camp's cluttered conditions, which she likened to the ""end of a music festival"", the atmosphere among migrants was wonderful.
However, she said she was shocked to learn the way refugees' make-shift homes were regularly torn down by the authorities.
""They do these things called clearances where they cordon off a section of the camp and then they make them hack up all their things - sometimes they'll confiscate items,"" she said.
""The idea is they kind of want to evict people and move people on. 
""I don't get why they take the tents and things. I think it's just intimidation.""
Although the group provides the basic items, Ms Congdon said one thing they often do is alter jeans to make them skinny.
She added it was important that the refugees could express their personalities through their clothing.
The Pas-de-Calais administrative department said the group's work ""complement the many humanitarian services of the state"".
But a spokesman insisted police conduct conformed to strict ethical and professional codes.
""Naturally anyone who believes they have witnessed a violation or misconduct can come forward to the IGPN [inspection générale de la Police nationale (national police inspectorate)] or the public prosecutor,"" he added.
""It must be noted, however, that the extraordinary complaints against the IGPN have not led to any conviction or indictment of a police officer for the abuse of a member of the groups or any migrant.""

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-45546650,refugee,19 September 2018,None,Venezuela's migration crisis: Is enough being done?,"It has been called one of the worst migration crises in Latin America's history. The United Nations has said it could reach a ""crisis point' comparable to what was seen in the Mediterranean in 2015. And Brazil's President Michel Temer has warned it is now a threat to the peace of all of South America. 
The BBC's South America correspondent, Katy Watson, looks at how the crisis has been dealt with so far and what more can be done.
Tensions have been mounting among Venezuela's neighbours. In August, there were clashes on the Brazil-Venezuela border between migrants and locals. 
Ecuador and Peru restricted entry of Venezuelans to those with passports, although Ecuador's decision was later overturned by a judge. It drew criticism from neighbours like Colombia. Ecuador also declared a state of emergency in parts of the country most affected by migration. 
All of this led people to worry that the region was starting to shut down, at a time when Venezuelans most need help. But, say experts, the past few weeks need to be put into context. 
""The reality is that very quietly for two years, South Americans have welcomed more than two million Venezuelans without taking any of these restrictive measures,"" says Benjamin Gedan of the Woodrow Wilson Centre in Washington DC. 
""They are now reaching their capacities and their political systems are reacting. This region has been much, much more generous than is the trend in the rest of the world."" 
Some have criticised the regional response as haphazard. But in recent weeks, Latin American nations seem to be working together. 
Brazil is stepping up efforts to relocate Venezuelans from the isolated north of the country to bigger cities like Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo so they can find work and settle more easily. 
At the beginning of September, Ecuador also hosted a summit that ended with an 18-point declaration made by 11 countries in the region. 
In it, they agreed the need for more cooperation and information sharing, as well as extra support for the countries most affected by migration, such as Colombia. 
Latin America has some of the most advanced laws in the world when it comes to migrants and refugees. 
Many countries established the laws when immigration was not a concern - people were leaving the region for Europe and the US. But those times have changed with the Venezuelan migration crisis.
""The Venezuelan displacement I see as a first test of this liberalisation of immigration and refugee laws in the region,"" says Feline Freier of the University of the Pacific in Peru.
While many countries use the 1951 Refugee Convention to define a refugee, most of the region uses a broader definition shaped from The Cartagena Declaration on Refugees in 1984. 
It defines refugees as including people who have fled the country because of generalised violence and massive violation of human rights that have disturbed public order - so under Cartagena, says Ms Freire, most Venezuelans would be classified as refugees. 
There is still a reluctance to classify the situation as a full-on refugee crisis, as that comes with more responsibilities than a migrant crisis. 
The UN refugee agency (UNHCR) has referred to a ""mixed flow"" of migrants and refugees. 
The region in turn has preferred to integrate Venezuelans into society rather than categorise them as refugees. 
Just last week, the US Ambassador to the UN, Nikki Haley, called on members of the UN Security Council to take steps for more concrete action against Venezuela. 
But with permanent Security Council members Russia and China still allies of Venezuela, there is little prospect of agreement among the Council members. Added to that, there have to be specific conditions to merit a UN Security Council response. 
""There isn't the level of violence that would make it easy to argue that Venezuela is a threat to international peace and security that demands Security Council action,"" says Marcos Tourinho of the Getúlio Vargas Foundation in São Paulo. 
""If the crisis becomes even more internationalised than it is now, I think you could see pressure from neighbouring states to have more action in the Security Council. But it's not reached that point yet."" 
US President Donald Trump has threatened military action, but that has been widely condemned. 
Just this weekend, the Lima Group of Latin American countries expressed its concern after the head of the Organization of American States, Luis Almagro, said military intervention would not be ruled out. 
The US has given more than $46m (£35m) in humanitarian aid but beyond that, experts say US leadership on the issue is unlikely. 
""The US is traditionally the leader in the Western Hemisphere on issues of humanitarian concern, particularly on refugee issues,"" says Benjamin Gedan. 
""Although it would be nice for the US to play a leadership role, it would also be laughable and deeply hypocritical for the US to strong-arm countries in the region to act humanely towards Venezuelan migrants when the US has such a restrictionist policy right now regarding immigrants and refugees.""
""The US has completely lost credibility on what is one of the most pressing global concerns.""

Protesters in the world's largest refugee camp in Bangladesh demanded justice and brandished a banner proclaiming: ""Never Again."" 
Myanmar's military launched its crackdown on the ethnic group after Rohingya militants attacked police posts in Rakhine state on 25 August.
More than 700,000 have now fled.
The United Nations described the military offensive in Rakhine as a ""textbook example of ethnic cleansing"" and refugees who have fled the violence have told horrific stories of sexual violence and torture.
According to Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF), at least 6,700 Rohingya, including at least 730 children under the age of five, were killed in the first month after the violence broke out.
But Myanmar's government says it is fighting Rohingya militants and says it is not targeting civilians. 
""The Myanmar military raped and killed our women, destroyed our properties,"" Rakib Hossain told BBC Bengali. ""They have to be punished. We want justice.""
Ashiya Begum, whose husband was killed during the violence in Rakhine, called camp life ""miserable"". 
""We can't continue like this. Let us go home,"" she said. 
There were also religious services, with an imam reportedly asking God in his sermon to return the Rohingya to their homeland ""to see our parents' graves"".
A local police chief told AFP that about 40,000 refugees took part in the protests.
The Myanmar government has agreed a deal with Bangladesh to repatriate refugees but few have returned, with Rohingya leaders saying they would not go back unless they could guarantee their safety.
Myanmar's leader Aung San Suu Kyi, winner of the 1991 Nobel peace prize, has faced international outrage for not condemning the army's actions in Rakhine state.
A predominantly Buddhist country, Myanmar denies the Rohingya citizenship.
The government even excluded them from the 2014 census and refused to recognise them as a people.

Sarah Mardini, 23, was one of three members of an aid group arrested in what police described as an operation to dismantle a ""criminal network"".
She and her sister Yusra came to Europe after fleeing the Syrian war in 2015.
That year, the pair helped save more than a dozen migrants by pulling their broken-down boat to shore in Greece.
Ms Mardini's lawyer told AFP news agency his client had been volunteering on the island of Lesbos with Emergency Response Centre International when she was arrested along with a Greek and an Irish national.
She is being held at a prison outside of Athens, he added, describing the case as ""criminalising help given to refugees"".
Ms Mardini denies the charges against her.
More than 8,000 people are currently being held at the Moria camp on the island, in very poor conditions.
The two sisters left their family home in Damascus in August 2015 and travelled more than 1,000 miles to Germany.
They settled in Berlin, where Sarah was awarded a scholarship to study economics and social sciences at Bard College.
Her younger sister Yusra went on to represent the first Team Refugee at the Rio Olympics in 2016 and has since become a goodwill ambassador for the UN's refugee agency.

http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-40707114,refugee,28 July 2017,By Georgina Rannard & Hannah Gelbart,From Baghdad to the bar: A blind refugee's journey,"As Aphra watched her son Allan graduate from Cambridge University last month, she thought back to the moment he was born.
""I'm so sorry your baby is blind,"" a neighbour in Baghdad had said.
Aphra became the talk of the town because of the taboo associated with her son's condition.
It was Iraq in 1995 - Saddam Hussein was president, the Gulf War had ended only three years earlier and citizens were suffering under sanctions placed on the country.
As a blind child, Allan Hennessy's prospects were poor.
Today, walking around his college in Cambridge, Allan is confident and articulate:
""I have so many accents now,"" he says.
""If someone from Iraq calls, I answer in Arabic, 'As-salaam-alaikum'.
""At Cambridge I have a posh, round-vowelled voice.
""Then I speak to a mate from the estate - 'Oh my days, all right bruv?' 
He is only 22 but already Allan has smashed barriers that many will not face in a lifetime. 
So how did a baby born blind in a war-torn country become a top student at a world-leading university? 
In Iraq, Allan's family were middle class - his grandfather was a sheikh and they lived a comfortable, even luxurious life.
But Iraqi hospitals could not offer Allan hope of sight. 
""My dad tried to get me treatment but there weren't enough eye specialists - they thought I would always be blind.""
But when Allan was six months old, an opportunity came and Allan's father seized it.
""My dad sold up to pay for the treatment - his car, belongings, some of his land. We left Iraq with very little.""
The opportunity was an operation in London which restored partial sight in Allan's left eye.
""My mum remembers the first time I looked at her - the first time we made eye contact. She burst into tears.
""Since then I've just been rocking on with the little sight I have,"" he explains.
Allan's mother and his siblings also sought political asylum in London, but life as immigrants was challenging.
""They enjoyed their life in Iraq, but when circumstances changed, they were forced to become refugees.
""They did not speak English, and we lived on London council estates - they had a real culture shock.""
""Jihadi John"" - who joined so-called Islamic State in Syria and appeared in videos showing beheadings of prisoners - grew up on the same estate.
Although Allan is visibly uncomfortable at any mention of the militant, the link highlights the difference between his childhood and many of his peers at Cambridge.
""When people at university ask me about my life, they think 'he's had a really difficult life'.
""But the reason I'm able to get on with it is because I look back at my family in Iraq and I think I'm very privileged.""
Allan is not the type of person to do what he is told.
""I've lived my life thinking I'm not partially-sighted.
""I loved riding my bike and climbing scaffolding, even though I wasn't really meant to.
""When we went to the fairground, I always wanted to drive the bumper cars.""
Like many children, Allan was no angel at school.
""I was in the lowest set for everything and I would bunk off school. I threw eggs at buses, stuff that teenagers do,"" he says.
But eventually Allan realised he could do better:
""After GCSEs I got a new energy and I realised the kids in the top sets weren't any smarter than me.""
In 2012 he applied to study law at Cambridge University.
""Everyone and everything was so white - I felt visibly different,"" he says, recalling his first impressions. 
He became one of only seven people with impaired sight accepted that year and the first person in his family to attend university.
""All my life I've been told I cannot, must not, should not and would not. The disabled stereotype is subdued, helpless - and the biggest struggle for me is to overcome that stigma.
""When you leave your lane, you are treated with negativity and scorn. You receive a lot of hatred for what you do, but all you're doing is what 'normal' people are doing,"" he says.
Allan spent three years at Fitzwilliam College and says it has been transformative.
""I met the most amazing people from all over the world. But there was also a lot of negativity directed at me.
""When you're an overweight, brown, blind guy climbing the greasy pole, everyone can see and they judge you - even though they are doing it too.""
What would his life be like if he had stayed in Iraq?
""I wouldn't have a Cambridge law degree - I wouldn't even be sighted.
""My family there have faced terrible, traumatic events, including capture by so-called Islamic State.
""Perhaps I wouldn't be alive.""
After graduating this summer, Allan is taking up a prestigious scholarship at law school.
""If you've got a first-class law degree from Cambridge University, that should set you up for life,"" he says.
""But when you're a blind, Muslim immigrant living in Britain today, there is so much more I have to do. The journey has only just begun.""

http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-40641352,refugee,22 July 2017,By Lucy Ballinger,Highs and lows as small town sponsors refugee family,"They have donated time, skills, money and even a house in a bid to be allowed to help a family of refugees resettle in the UK.
But, as the Home Office announces £1m to help more communities sponsor refugees, just how much work was it for one group of retirees, part and full-time workers to pull together and take responsibility for a family?
Christine Hughes kept seeing pictures and videos on Facebook of Syrian refugees and their desperate bids to get to the UK. And she wanted to help.
""I was hearing the most awful stories and just not sleeping,"" mother-of-four and grandmother Mrs Hughes said.
""If I started thinking about it before I went to sleep, that was it, I just couldn't sleep, because I knew what people were suffering right at that moment while there I was in my cosy bed.""
No longer wanting to feel helpless, she and a few other people held a meeting in the Pembrokeshire town of Narberth to discuss what they could do.
A year later and she has finally achieved her goal - to resettle a refugee family in the picturesque market town. 
It is one of 10 to have brought a group of refugees to the UK under a scheme introduced in July 2016. 
It means community can take responsibility for resettling up to three refugee families - supporting their move here by setting up accommodation for them, helping them to learn English and eventually find jobs.
The vast majority of the 20,000 Syrian refugees the UK has committed to take in have come through the support of local councils. But community groups have sponsored 53 refugees in the last year. 
The scheme was modelled on the successful Canadian Private Sponsorship scheme which has resettled more than 200,000 refugees since it was introduced in 1978.
But the group called Croeso Arberth - meaning Narberth Welcome - said it had not been straight-forward.
It had to raise £4,500 as insurance to cover each of the seven supported refugees, which is kept in a separate bank account for emergencies, as well as having £6,000 in the bank to cover the cost of things like interpreters, transport from the airport and a £200 allowance for each member of the family - given in small amounts for six weeks while they wait for their applications for benefits to go through. 
A house had to be found, English lessons arranged, schools contacted and extensive Home Office forms filled in - and that was just to start. 
Listen to Croeso Arberth prepare to welcome the family of refugees on BBC Radio Wales' Eye on Wales programme
The UK government website has information about how to sponsor a family of vulnerable refugees to resettle in the UK
Retired nurse Mrs Hughes said: ""I had absolutely no idea of the amount of time I was going to have to donate to it. 
""I have got a house I rent out, my mother is 93, I have got three horses, I've got four children, two of who have got grandchildren, and have a few little jobs cleaning guest houses, so I'm tearing myself away from different situations, just trying to cope, really.
""Halfway through the process I did think 'what am I doing', but thinking we were nearly there is what has kept me going.""
The group, which has a core of 12 people with around 100 more who have expressed a desire to help, has committed to support the resettled family for a year, and be responsible for their housing - paid for with housing benefits - for two years.
Mrs Hughes said: ""I started off as an email pusher - just keeping people informed about meetings and fund-raising events. Then I started doing practical things like phoning up the schools, I went to the police, I went to the doctors.""
Shortly after she and other members of the group wrote an action plan for the Home Office - a plan that has been revised multiple times since the application first went in. 
Jill Simpson, who works part-time at Pembrokeshire Coast National Park Authority, liaised with the Home Office on behalf of Croeso Arberth throughout the negotiations.
She said: ""I spent months sitting at my computer, pulling together all sorts of information, writing documents. At times it felt as if it was being made very difficult, but I think that, on reflection, it is because it is such a new scheme and the Home Office people have been feeling their way as well.
""There was a lot of support, but you needed to get through this nitty gritty bureaucracy.""
Information from Home Office
The group needed approval from local council Pembrokeshire to go ahead with the application, as well as getting approval from Citizens UK, who acted as the lead sponsor - with legal responsibility to make sure everything runs as it should.
Finding housing was extremely complicated.
Mrs Simpson said: ""We had to describe the house to the Home Office, and it had to be available, but we didn't know how long it would take until we had a family, and that was really difficult because if you think about it no landlord is going to want to sit with a house empty waiting for a family to arrive at an unspecified time.""
But the group struck lucky when local Oshi Owen, who was thinking about moving from her five-bedroom house in Narberth, heard the group were looking for somewhere for the refugee family.
Ms Owen said: ""I had thought about moving in September, but when the group were looking for somewhere for a family of refugees I just said I will somehow manage it and make it work and committed to move out by April.""
She will be paid rent through housing benefit, although she said it is below what she could get for the house if it was privately rented.
The group initially thought they might be able to have the family arrive in April and eventually the arrival date became July.
Ms Owen said: ""I had to accept that for three months there wasn't going to be any rent coming in. 
""But I would rather help people than it being about the money. It is about giving something to those in need.""
She left some furniture in the house for the new tenants, while the community group cleared the garden and cleaned in preparation.
Ms Owen said neighbours were ""shocked"" to hear who was moving in, but ""really want to make the family welcome"".
With the house spick and span there was a nervous wait before the refugees arrived on 13 July.
As they walked through arrivals at Birmingham Airport they were greeted by a welcome party of interpreters and members of Croeso Arberth clutching balloons, chocolates and a big sign between them.
BBC Wales have agreed not to identify Narberth's newest Syrian residents - but we can say they are an extended family of seven from a refugee camp in the Middle East.
""I can't believe it is all over with now,"" Mrs Hughes said.
""I would never have expected it to be such a big thing to undertake, but I feel like the family are going to be fine, and it is the start of a new chapter now with them here. Things will go wrong, but we will just have to play it by ear.""
Croeso Arberth have plans to sponsor another group of refugees in the near future, but hope it will be easier next time.
Mrs Hughes added: ""Because we have been one of the first groups to do this it has been a learning curve for us and the Home Office, but hopefully they will be able to do things faster for other groups and it will all move along a bit quicker. 
""Obviously I still think about the people still in refugee camps, but I know I cannot do any more than I have done and am doing.""

http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-40580529,refugee,25 July 2017,By James Badcock,Refugee children on Lesbos helped to face fear of drowning,"""I call it reconciliation,"" says Manuel Elviro. He is part of a Spanish volunteer group that felt compelled to act after seeing some of the dramatic drawings by children who survived the perilous sea crossing from Turkey to Greece.
""There were monsters in the sea and people drowning.""
The volunteers' task was to try to entice traumatised children on the island of Lesbos back into the sea to help them tackle their fears. As well as the terror of the crossing, the children had depicted the war zones they had fled and the filth of the refugee camps, rife with violence and sexual abuse.
""Worst of all, they drew hopelessness,"" recalls Mr Elviro, a technology researcher from Spain's Balearic Islands University who volunteered for charity Proem-aid.
""As I am from Mallorca, a Mediterranean man, I love my sea. It was like an affront. We had to do something."" 
In 2016, some 173,000 people reached the Greek islands from Turkey. At one point, 2,000 migrants and refugees were reaching Lesbos every day and Proem-Aid says it saved about 50,000 lives.
But an EU deal with Turkey last year has dramatically slowed that number to an average of up to 70 a day. The ""pull factor"" that some accuse NGOs of providing to migrants off the coast of Libya is not currently an issue on Lesbos.
The period of relative calm gave the group more time to work with survivors in makeshift immigrant camps such as Pikpa, home to some of the most vulnerable individuals who have lost relatives or suffer disabilities.
""Many of the children are from Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan, and had never seen the sea before. It's a hostile environment for them,"" says Lara Lussón, a volunteer who left her native Madrid for Lesbos in January.  
For Sahaar, 15, and her five-year-old brother Satria, their journey from Afghanistan to the gates of Europe ended in tragedy when their mother and two brothers aged eight and 12 were washed overboard. 
""Sahaar screamed every time she saw the water,"" says Manuel Elviro. ""They were like koalas, clinging to us, saying 'Blue no good, blue no good'."" 
""Now the danger is that they will get hypothermia because we can't get them out the water,"" he laughs. ""Sahaar said 'I'm going to Turkey', and I had to grab her by the leg and pull her out."" 
The volunteers work with about a dozen children at a time on spring and summer afternoons, when the water is warm. ""They are not swimming lessons; it's not like a summer camp,"" he explains. 
Adam, a six-year-old Iraqi Kurd, arrived at Pikpa camp with an eye problem. His eyelids were glued together, possibly due to exposure to chemical munitions.
""We took him to the water to relax him while his eyes were getting better.""
The best treatment for trauma is to confront it, argues Essam Daod, a child psychiatrist and co-founder of Humanity Crew, an NGO that addresses mental health issues among migrants in Greek camps.
""Swimming gives them a sense of control where they had none and fear was the sole master,"" Dr Daod told Spanish website eldiario.es. 
Manuel Elviro tells the story of a Syrian boy who lost his entire family in a bombardment. 
""He told me: 'When I come with you to swim, that night I can sleep all right'.""
The idea has recently been extended to include some of the children's mothers. The man-free sessions, known as ""women's own water"" have benefited migrants like Fahtia, who arrived from Somalia with a new-born baby.
The work of the Spanish charity off the shores of Lesbos is not without controversy.
Three Proem-Aid volunteers will face jail terms of up to 10 years if a trial due next April upholds charges of people smuggling and possession of illegal weapons.
Manuel Blanco, Julio Latorre and Enrique Rodríguez, all firefighters from Seville, were arrested by Greek coastguards in January 2016 on the waters off Lesbos as they were mounting a search-and-rescue mission for migrants. 
The Greek authorities consider that the knives the Spaniards were carrying constitute ""illegal weapons"". The volunteers argue the knives were the minimum blade length required to cut through ropes, nets or other material when rescuing people from the sea. 
Two Danish volunteers were arrested at the same time. 
A note on terminology: The BBC uses the term migrant to refer to all people on the move who have yet to complete the legal process of claiming asylum. This group includes people fleeing war-torn countries such as Syria, who are likely to be granted refugee status, as well as people who are seeking jobs and better lives, who governments are likely to rule are economic migrants.

http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-40651185,refugee,20 July 2017,None,Canada campaign to reunite Yazidi boy with refugee mother,"Canada says it is aware of the case of a Yazidi boy recently rescued by Iraqi forces whose mother is in Winnipeg. 
Nofa Mihlo Rafo arrived in Canada this year as a refugee with four of her six children. 
She was separated from her husband and two eldest sons after their town was captured by the so-called Islamic State in 2014. 
She learned this week that one missing son is still alive after a relative alerted her to a photo posted online.
Ms Mihlo Rafo learned last Sunday that 12-year-old Emad Mishko Tamo was alive and had been rescued. 
She ""was jumping, crying at the same time, just happiness"", said Hadji Hesso, with the Yazidi Association of Manitoba. 
His group, in partnership with the Kurdish Initiative for Refugees, Winnipeg Friends of Israel and the Liberation of Christian and Yazidi Children of Iraq (CYCI), has launched a campaign to reunite the boy with his family. 
On Thursday, Canada's federal immigration department said it is aware of the boy's case and noted that the government has committed to bringing up to 1,200 vulnerable Yazidi women and children and other survivors of IS to Canada. 
""All Yazidi cases are being expedited,"" said a department spokeswoman in an email.  
Steven Maman, the founder of CYCI, says that all 338 Canadian members of parliament were sent information about the boy. 
""Everyone has received an email from us with Emad's story, his mother's identification cards, everything,"" Mr Maman said.  ""It's a moral obligation for us human beings to help her."" 
There is also a special programme that allows refugees to apply to bring in dependent children within a year of arrival. 
Iraqi troops who found the boy posted his image online in hope of finding his family, said Mr Hesso. 
The boy's uncle saw the photo, contacted Emad's mother, and met the boy at the hospital where he was being treated for shrapnel and gunshot wounds. 
Mr Hesso says the boy is recovering and now with his uncle in a camp in Iraq. 
Ms Mihlo Rafo and her children are all members of the persecuted religious Yazidi minority. They were rounded up by IS jihadists in their town of Sinjar in northern Iraq and held captive for two years.  She eventually managed to escape to a refugee camp with four of her children.

http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-39621097,refugee,19 April 2017,By Theopi Skarlatos,Greece's refugee children learn the hard way,"The first day of school. It was supposed to be an exciting, happy time for so many of the 2,500 refugee children now living in camps in Greece.
But instead some were met with stone-throwing and nationalist slogans, after far-right demonstrators took issue with the government's policy to integrate them. 
Fortunately for 10-year-old Moustafa, his appointed school in Thessaloniki saw no protests. And despite living in a metal container known as an isobox, the past few months have brought a form of structure to his life. 
He spent a year fleeing war and fearing for his life, but now he has a schedule. 
Every afternoon he boards a coach organised by the International Organization for Migration (IOM) that takes him to the city centre for school. He is one of 60,000 refugees and migrants trapped in Greece since relocation to European countries stagnated and the borders were closed. 
Moustafa explains how his village near Damascus was trapped between rival warring groups and, before it was too late, his family headed for Europe. 
He recounts the moment they were rescued from a sinking dinghy - so accurately, it is as if he is playing back recorded footage. 
He shows off the school kit he has been given, including notebooks, pens, pencils and a rucksack.
""The most important thing now is for me to study and learn Greek,"" Moustafa says. ""I want to be a doctor.""

Serbian attitudes harden as migrants gather once again
The new school initiative backed by the EU follows a law passed by the Greek parliament last August. It kickstarted new classes to prepare refugee children for eventual integration into the Greek education system. 
Ninety-seven schools are currently involved. In three, the initiative was met with contempt. Crowds of far-right nationalists gathered to wave Greek flags, boo the children and shout slogans such as ""My homeland won't fall!""
In the town of Profitis, riot police were called in to escort pupils after stones were thrown. 
In Oraiokastro, protesters chained themselves to the school gates. The self-styled ""Patriotic Union of Greek Citizens of Oraiokastro"" said they didn't believe the pupils had been adequately vaccinated - something the health ministry has denied. In Perama, there were reports of physical violence.
In contrast, the arrival of pupils at Moustafa's school in Thessaloniki went smoothly. The headteacher, Ioannis Nomikoudis, says it is down to the communication between the government, school and parents' committee.
""The parents of the children here are not racist, but they do still have concerns and we cannot ignore that. The thing is, we didn't make the children's arrival debatable - like in some places.""
For Education Ministry General Secretary Giannis Pantis, the fact that there were protests at only three of the 97 schools was a success. ""In many other schools the children were welcomed with songs and balloons,"" he said.
He oversaw the programme from the start, when a scientific committee of leading Greek intercultural education experts and sociologists was brought together to provide advice. They assessed the work of NGOs in the camps and designed the curriculum of maths, Greek, English, art, IT and physical education.
The implementation of the programme has not come without its problems, though. 
The lack of certified Greek-Arabic translators is a huge issue. The government says it is not a question of not being able to afford them, but that they just do not exist. 
Maths teacher Irene Voutskoglou said she did not realise how big the challenge would be. 
""We can't really communicate well at all,"" she says. ""I have to appoint a student as an 'assistant teacher' to help me. I didn't even realise that numbers were different in Arabic. Our zero is a dot in Arabic for example. And our five looks like a seven in Arabic.""
Most translators are provided through charities, who receive funding from the European Union. But camp coordinators say the translators' language skills are often not good enough and that they are also needed to teach the children their native language.
""This is supposed to be a transitional year,"" says Giannis Pantis, the man from the ministry.
""The children attend school in the afternoon, when the school day for current pupils has finished. We believe they cannot yet be fully integrated.
""Last week a child saw a helicopter and ran out of the school. Another started to cry and hid beneath the table. Some of these children, due to the war, are almost 10 years old but have never been to school. They can't read or write. Many of them have post-traumatic stress disorder. We have a lot to do this year.""
With a flagging economy and an education system already crippled by six years of austerity, the refugee crisis has further stretched Greece's capacity. 
The government is reliant on just €7m (£6m; $7.5m) of European funding for the next two years (NGOs have received €83m directly) and the Greek national budget to implement the programme. 
Despite the struggles, Mr Pantis says they are determined to honour the government's commitment to the fundamental and universal right to education.

http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/blogs-trending-40653714,refugee,19 July 2017,By Lamia Estatie,None,"Lebanese security forces have detained a group of men who physically and verbally assaulted a Syrian refugee.
A video showing the attack - widely shared on WhatsApp, Facebook and Twitter - prompted a social media outcry.
During the beating, the men are heard shouting expletives at a refugee named Uklah. They demand he praises the Lebanese army and curses the so-called Islamic State group (IS) and all the Syrian people. Uklah is identified as a native of Deir al-Zour, an eastern province in Syria, mostly under IS control.
The men are also shown kicking Uklah as he lies on the ground, begging them to cease.
A voice note calling on Lebanese to ""beat Syrians"" was also shared on WhatsApp, according to journalist and blogger Kareem Chehayeb.
Lebanese Facebook user Charbel T Abou Zeid said the attack was a ""reaction"" while Kristel Aoun said ""it's a normal response to videos made by Syrians abroad cursing Lebanese"".
The attack occurred ahead of a protest in solidarity with Syrian refugees planned for 18 July but which was cancelled due to threats. The Lebanese government subsequently banned all protests in the country, citing security reasons.
While some people online rallied behind the attackers, others labelled their acts as ""racist"".
Tension has heightened around Syrian refugees in Lebanon, who account for an estimated one in four people in the country. The Lebanese president has said that the country ""can no longer carry the burden"" of refugees while denouncing ""hate and incitement"".
Earlier this month, four Syrians died in custody - after being tortured by Lebanese soldiers, reported Middle East Eye - following army raids on refugee camps in Arsal, in the country's east. A probe has since been ordered into their deaths.
The Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) are reported to be preparing an operation in the same area as Arsal, close to the Syrian border, to force out militants using it as a base to fight in Syria.  
Facebook user Roro Berjawi expressed support for the men beating the refugee saying Lebanon had ""suffered a similar fate at the hands of the Syrian government,"" referencing the decades-long presence of Syrian troops in the country until their full withdrawal in 2005 after former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri's assassination. 
The men in the video also pressed Uklah on whether he was to attend a planned, then cancelled, sit-in protest organised by the Socialist Forum and other activists which has been accused of protesting against the army. 
Commenting on the attack, Gisele Tannoury tweeted: ""Should we forgive the refugees who cursed the army? Has anyone caught them or are we forgiving them because our humanity is overtaking national interest?"" 
But many Lebanese also used social media to decry the attack, using the Arabic-language hashtag #No_to_racism.
A professor who has tried to counter some perceptions of Syrian refugees in Lebanon tweeted that the ""vast majority (83%) of Syrian refugees living in Lebanon rent houses"", contributing to the economy.
Several also re-circulated old banners which read: ""Welcome to Syrian refugees and workers in Lebanon. We are sorry for what the racists among us commit.""
""I am against racism, injustice and violence of all kinds. There is absolutely no justification,"" one Twitter user said.
Wassim Haffar also tweeted: ""This is disgraceful and disgusting to watch! I'm so ashamed!!""
Another Twitter user continued: ""Lebanese should be renouncing racism given so many of them live abroad.""

http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-40442848,refugee,18 July 2017,By Emma Jane Kirby,NHS pilot scheme taps into skills of refugee doctors,"A pioneering scheme that aims to harness the skills of refugees fleeing conflict and unrest in their home countries could help boost health services in north-east England. 
Middlesbrough has the highest number of asylum seekers in the UK. Around one in every 186 people in the town is seeking refugee status, well over the government guidelines of no more than one in every 200 of the local population. 
But many of the refugees are skilled professionals such as doctors or pharmacists, skills that happen to be in short supply in the area. 
I have been to meet the foreign doctors who are participating in the scheme. Unable to practise their profession at home, they are embracing the opportunity to use their skills in an understaffed NHS.
Rouni Youssef, 27, picks up a patient's notes from the trolley outside the curtained cubicle and begins to thumb through the details.
""Interesting,"" he mutters to himself. ""I think we should do an MRI.""
I ask him what the day ahead on the hospital ward is looking like but Dr Youssef does not hear me. He is focused on the medical details before him, his eyes flicking feverishly over the scans like a sleuth over clues. 
""Maybe some kidney malfunction here,"" he says.
Dr Youssef is polite and friendly towards me but I know I am holding him back from what he would rather be doing. It is, after all, what he has dreamed of doing all his life and what he has spent so many years training to do.
""I'm a Kurd from Aleppo,"" he shrugs. ""And I'm a medical doctor but it just became too unsafe to stay in Syria and in 2014, I had to flee. 
""I ended up here in Middlesbrough with nothing: no friends, no family and no career. I couldn't be a doctor any more. You can't imagine how that feels. It was like someone had cut off a body part. 
""I was nothing and I had to start from scratch.""
But thanks to the scheme run by the North Tees and Hartlepool NHS Trust and a refugee charity called Investing in People and Culture, Dr Youssef once again is sporting a stethoscope around his neck.  
He is currently on an unpaid clinical placement at the University Hospital of North Tees but he has just taken the second part of his Plab exams (an assessment conducted by the General Medical Council which all overseas doctors from outside the EEA must pass before they can legally practise medicine in the UK). If he passes, he will start applying for jobs in September.
""I'd love to be a consultant paediatrician,"" he admits shyly. ""Babies are such dear little creatures - they're like angels, you know?""  
Dr Jane Metcalf, deputy medical director at the hospital, pops down to the ward to find out how his latest exams have gone.  
She describes the Resettlement Programme For Overseas Doctors as primarily a humanitarian project to get skilled healthcare professionals back into practice but she also admits that, since the North East has a shortage of qualified doctors, it is also in the trust's interests to use their refugee resources.   
The current scheme comprises 11 doctors and one pharmacist, from Syria, Afghanistan, Iraq, Iran, Yemen, Sudan, Pakistan and the Congo.
""It's a win-win situation,"" Dr Metcalf explains. ""Although the training is rigorous, the cost is low... to help the doctors through their exams and English tuition it's about £5,000 per doctor and when you compare that to the £250,000 it takes to train someone in the UK through medicine, it's pretty cost-effective. 
""If we can get doctors like Rouni back into practice within a year that would be a tremendous achievement.""  
The biggest hurdle for the doctors though is passing the extremely high level, but requisite, English exam. 
In an upstairs room at Middlesbrough library, the other doctors on the pilot scheme are learning about the inappropriate use of colloquial English in the written form.
Everyone is grumbling about the finicky example on the white board which, despite being a native speaker and having a university degree in English, even makes me pause for thought.   
Eli, a GP from Congo, has had a long and difficult battle to win refugee status and was unable to join the scheme until his asylum papers were granted. While waiting however, he volunteered for the Alzheimer's Society and is now determined to work in geriatric medicine.  
""We are refugees, yes,"" he smiles. ""But we are doctors too. We don't take this opportunity for granted. Before this programme we had no road, no route. Now we have hope again. And we can give something back.""
Ahmad, from Afghanistan, was just months away from completing his medical training as a specialist in paediatric orthopaedics when his life was threatened by the Taliban, forcing him and his family to flee Kabul. 
""Now I'm optimistic for the future,"" he says. ""I know that one day soon I will practise my passion again.""
Outside the library I meet Bini Araia, founder of Investing in People and Culture, the charity working in partnership with North Tees and Hartlepool NHS Trust. He tells me that before the scheme's existence, many of the refugee surgeons and doctors, under pressure from their local job centre, were resigned to a life in the UK working in factories, garages or supermarkets.
""But we have a ready-made skill set!"" he tells me. ""And it's great to show with this programme that refugees can benefit UK society."" 
Back on the ward at the hospital, there are no ""baby angels"" for Dr Youssef to treat today. Instead, his mentor, consultant physician Dr Sue Jones, asks him to join her as she examines an elderly patient who has been complaining of acute hip pain. Dr Youssef jogs eagerly to the patient's bedside.
""Well hello sir!"" he beams. ""And how are you feeling today? Is it really true you're 101?"" He squats down and holds the man's hand, joking with him and reassuring him. I catch Dr Jones's eye. ""Isn't he impressive?"" she mouths delightedly. 
Dr Metcalf wants to encourage other NHS trusts to implement the resettlement scheme for refugee doctors, something Dr Youssef welcomes.
""When I first walked back on to the ward,"" he remembers, ""it felt like I had been fasting for 18 hours and then someone gave me a sip of cold, delicious water.""
We walk together to the Rapid Assessment clinic. 
""I want to be a doctor here in Middlesbrough,"" he continues, ""because the people are so friendly."" Then he grins.""But the local accent here, it's a bit, um, fresh, isn't it?""

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-45307003,refugee,26 August 2018,None,Venezuela migrant crisis: Peru receives asylum requests,"Hundreds of Venezuelans have requested asylum in Peru, an official has said, just hours after the country tightened its entry requirements. 
New rules require Venezuelans trying to enter Peru to have a passport, and not just an identity card as before.
Similar regulations were introduced in Ecuador last week, only to be overturned by a court.
Tens of thousands of Venezuelans are fleeing their country amid chronic shortages of food and medicines.
The country's longstanding economic crisis has seen more than two million citizens leave since 2014, causing regional tensions as neighbouring countries struggle to accommodate them.
Like other South American nations, Peru is trying to control the influx of people escaping Venezuela's economic crisis. 
The UN - whose migration agency has warned that the continent faces a refugee ""crisis moment"" similar to that seen in the Mediterranean in 2015 - is setting up a special team to co-ordinate the regional response.
The authorities in Lima set a deadline of midnight on Friday for the new passport rules to come into force.
Many Venezuelans have been looking to start a new life in Peru - which has one of the region's fastest growing economies - travelling there via Colombia and Ecuador.
On Friday there was a rush of people heading to the Peruvian border and Ecuador created what it called a ""humanitarian corridor"" by laying on buses to take migrants through the country.  
Peruvian Prime Minister César Villanueva said requiring Venezuelans to show their passport at the border did not mean that Peru was ""closing the door"" to migrants.
He said ID cards did not provide enough information and could easily be forged.
Citizens of most South American nations can visit countries in the region without needing a visa or even a passport. The Andean Community trading bloc - which includes Ecuador and Peru - also allows visa and passport-free travel for its citizens, although Venezuela withdrew from the grouping in 2006. 
Peru is already home to about 400,000 Venezuelan migrants, most of whom arrived in the past year.
On Friday, more than 2,500 crossed into the small Peruvian border town of Aguas Verdes, with thousands more trying to reach Peru at the main crossing point at Tumbes.
The Tumbes crossing has seen about 3,000 arrivals per day in recent weeks.
By Katy Watson, BBC News, Huaquillas, on the Peru-Ecuador border
Throughout Friday evening Venezuelans kept arriving, many in government-commandeered buses that had brought them from the Colombia-Ecuador border.
It was called a humanitarian corridor but, of course, it was one that was in Ecuador's interests, too. They didn't want to be left with stranded Venezuelans once midnight had passed. 
With less than 10 minutes to go before the deadline, there were more than 100 people with no passports waiting in the queue hoping to be allowed into Peru. 
Migration officials handed out a small pink ticket to those lining up. Those who were in the queue before midnight would be allowed to cross the border. Anyone else arriving after midnight would not. 
A seemingly insignificant piece of paper but one that would define the future for these Venezuelans heading to Peru to find work. 
Joel Millman, a spokesman for the International Organization for Migration (IOM) - a UN agency - said increasing border restrictions coupled with an outbreak of violence on the Brazilian border last week, was an early warning sign that the region was in need of help.
""This is building to a crisis moment that we've seen in other parts of the world, particularly in the Mediterranean,"" he told reporters.
Chiara Cardoletti of the UN's refugee agency (UNHCR), said other countries in the region had welcomed Venezuelans and were helping to ""avoid a situation like the one we have seen in Europe"".
""What we are seeing is a continent that has opened its doors to people who are fleeing and who need support,"" she told the BBC.
Ms Cardoletti added that Colombia had registered more than 450,000 Venezuelans and given them regular status.
Ecuador brought in new passport regulations last week, leaving hundreds of migrants stranded on it border with Colombia.
However, on Friday, a judge found that requiring Venezuelans to carry valid passports broke regional agreements on freedom of movement.
More than half a million Venezuelans have crossed into Ecuador this year alone and more than a million have entered Colombia in the past 15 months.
Brazil's northern state of Roraima has also had its attempt to close the border with Venezuela thrown out by a judge.
Violence erupted in the border town of Pacaraima last week when local residents attacked makeshift camps housing Venezuelan migrants. The camps were burned down and the occupants temporarily fled back across the border.
Despite the violence, the number of Venezuelans crossing daily into Brazil has continued to rise.
The government took drastic measures to stabilise the economy last week, issuing new banknotes that slashed five zeros off the bolívar. Runaway inflation had been predicted to hit one million per cent by the end of the year.
On Friday, Venezuela's information minister Jorge Rodriguez said the measures would persuade those Venezuelans who had left to return.
Economists have warned that the new measures do not address the root causes of inflation in Venezuela and that the printing of new notes could exacerbate inflation rather than curb it.

http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-39552222,refugee,10 April 2017,None,Clashes rock Palestinian refugee camp in Lebanon,"At least six people have been killed and 35 others wounded in clashes inside a Palestinian refugee camp in southern Lebanon since Friday, medics say.
The fighting erupted when a joint security force deployed by the main Palestinian factions in Ein el-Hilweh came under fire from radical Islamists.
The factions had told the Islamists, led by Bilal Badr, to disarm.
Local media said gunfire and explosions could be heard on Monday afternoon after a period of calm in the morning.
The official National News Agency reported that Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas' Fatah movement had rejected a deal proposed by mediators that would have seen Mr Badr allowed to go into hiding if he accepted the joint force.
Established in 1948 near the city of Sidon, Ein el-Hilweh is the largest of the 12 Palestinian camps in Lebanon. 
The UN says more than 54,000 registered refugees live there, but one recent estimate put the population at closer to 120,000.
Ein el-Hilweh, which like the other camps falls outside the jurisdiction of the Lebanese security services, has been plagued in recent months by deadly clashes between the various armed groups operating there.
Last week, the largest factions in the camp formed a joint force in an attempt ""to bring security to it"", a local Fatah commander told the NNA.
The factions agreed to dismantle the so-called Bilal Badr group, whose members have been accused of sheltering fugitives from the Lebanese authorities and issuing fatwas authorising the killing of people with whom they disagree.
But the force faced resistance as it deployed on Friday night, triggering fierce clashes that involved machine-guns and rocket-propelled grenades.
The fighting prompted the Lebanese army to close the highway next to the entrance to the camp and Lebanon's health ministry to evacuate patients from the nearby government hospital.

http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/in-pictures-39351433,refugee,3 April 2017,None,Trucking water to Uganda's refugee camps,"Hundreds of thousands of South Sudanese refugees have fled violence and hunger in their home country for the safety of camps in northern Uganda. More than 50,000 of them now live in Rhino camp, a sprawling expanse of huts and tents scattered across dusty scrubland near the town of Arua.
Life in the camp is tough, but everyone seems to agree that one of the main challenges is water. There are no boreholes, and the few streams that flow through the area are often completely dry. When they're not, the water runs a deep chocolate brown.
In response to the shortage, the International Federation of the Red Cross has resorted to trucking in water from the River Nile, which must be tested, treated, and re-tested before being offloaded into a fleet of tankers. It is then driven through the bush to the camp, where it is deposited in hundreds of smaller tanks, which must be refilled twice or three times a day.
Using a system of pipes and pumps, water is drawn from the river into floatation tanks, where aluminium sulphate is added to remove the sediment. The plant, which started producing water earlier this month, now employs more than 40 local and international staff.
Noor Pwani, a member of IFRC's staff, said: ""This is the only way we're going to stave off infectious diseases - a major concern given unsanitary conditions at crowded settlements and the coming rainy season when vector and water-borne diseases flourish."" 
Volunteer Agaba Derrick's job is to constantly monitor the river water, which varies in quality hour by hour. His findings dictate how much aluminium sulphate must be added. Chlorine is also added to kill off remaining bacteria.
When the water flows out the other side, it is crystal clear. The plant is scaling up to pump out a million litres of clean water each day. The recommended amount of water per person, per day, in the camps is between 15 and 20 litres, which is used for washing and cooking as well as drinking.
A fleet of around 30 tankers ferries the clean water to distribution points in the camp, which need to be refilled up to three times a day. In some areas roads had to be specially built to handle the volume of traffic. 
Monica Achan, who spent two weeks walking through the bush to Uganda after her brother-in-law was killed by soldiers, takes a sip of Nile water in her new home in the camp. 
""Life is hard here,"" she said. ""But with water, we will survive. Water is life.""

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-45381173,refugee,1 September 2018,None,Palestinians brand US aid cut to UN group 'a flagrant assault',"Palestinian officials have condemned the US decision to end all funding to the UN's Palestinian refugee agency.
The US has been the largest donor to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (Unrwa) - but now says the organisation is ""irredeemably flawed"".
Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas's spokesman has called the move a ""flagrant assault against the Palestinian people"".
However, an Israeli official told AFP: ""Israel supports the US move"".
Unrwa says it currently supports more than five million Palestinians in Gaza, the West Bank, Jordan, Syria and Lebanon, including providing health care, education and social services.
The US has been the largest single donor to Unrwa, providing $368m (£284m) in 2016 and funding almost 30% of its operations in the region.
But in January, the administration of President Donald Trump withheld more than half of its planned funding to Unrwa, saying it would keep back $65m unless the body carried out ""reforms"". 
On Friday, the US state department said in a statement that ""the US will no longer commit further funding to this irredeemably flawed operation"".
The state department said the US had shouldered a ""very disproportionate share of the burden of Unrwa's costs"", and that the international community should contribute more.
It has also said it is unhappy that Unrwa has kept expanding the number of people eligible for assistance, and says its business model is ""simply unsustainable and has been in crisis mode for many years"".
This links to a wider disagreement over which Palestinians are refugees with a right to return to the homes they fled following the 1948 Arab-Israeli war.
The UN says there are about five million Palestinian refugees, including the descendants of people who fled the 1948 war.
However, the US and Israel disagree with how this number is calculated, and say the number of Palestinian refugees should be much smaller.
President Trump also appears unhappy with how US aid to the region has been received.
He has previously tweeted that the US has not received ""appreciation or respect"" for the aid it has provided, and that the Palestinians are unwilling to negotiate with Israel. 
US ambassador to the UN, Nikki Haley, said earlier this week: ""There's an endless number of refugees that continue to get assistance, but more importantly, the Palestinians continue to bash America.""
The state department says it remains ""deeply concerned regarding the impact upon innocent Palestinians, especially school children, of the failure of Unrwa"".
The organisation's chief spokesperson, Chris Gunness, told the BBC the impact of the US move would be devastating.
""It's likely to be widespread, profound, dramatic and unpredictable because, let's make no mistake, some of the most marginalised and fragile and vulnerable communities in the Middle East are going to likely suffer because of this.""
Mr Gunness says 526,000 schoolchildren receive a Unrwa education every day, while it also assists ""1.7 million food insecure people"". 
""We do assistance to disabled refugees, to women, to vulnerable children. The list goes on and, as I say, the impact on them is likely to be utterly devastating.""
Germany's foreign ministry has said it will increase contributions to Unrwa to try to maintain stability.
Palestinian officials have condemned the US move. 
A spokesman for President Abbas told Reuters the decision was in ""defiance of UN resolutions"", and would not change the fact that the US ""no longer has a role in the region"" and ""is not a part of the solution"".
The Palestinian Liberation Organization said a statement that the cut was ""a cruel and irresponsible move targeting the most vulnerable segment of Palestinian society"". 
The Palestinian militant group Hamas told Reuters that the move was a ""grave escalation against the Palestinian people"".
Palestinian officials have already accused the US of pro-Israel bias, especially after Mr Trump recognised Jerusalem as Israel's capital and opened a US embassy in Jerusalem, despite the city being claimed by both sides.
The move overturned decades of US neutrality on the issue and attracted international criticism.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has previously called for Unrwa's funding to be cut gradually and its responsibilities transferred to the UN's global refugee agency, the UNHCR, arguing that it ""perpetuates the Palestinian problem"".
On Saturday, an official in Mr Netanyahu's office told AFP that ""Israel supports the US move"", adding: ""Consolidating the refugee status of Palestinians is one of the problems that perpetuates the conflict.""
However, some Israelis have previously raised concerns that weakening Unrwa could cause regional instability and create more extremism in the region.

http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-40474357,refugee,2 July 2017,None,Syrian refugee camp in Lebanon destroyed by fire,"At least one person has died and a number of people were wounded when a huge fire broke out at a camp for Syrian refugees in eastern Lebanon.
The blaze took hold at the camp near Qab Elias town in the Bekaa Valley. Footage from the scene showed near total devastation.
The UN refugee agency told Reuters the camp had housed 102 families. 
Lebanon has one million registered Syrian refugees, but believes the number is more like 1.5 million.
Many Syrians, displaced by more than six years of fighting in their own country, live in makeshift camps dotted around Lebanon.
The UNHCR's Dana Sleiman said it is thought the fire was caused by a cooking stove, but added ""we are waiting to confirm it"".
The Lebanese Red Cross told the AFP news agency that 700 refugees were evacuated from the camp as the flames took hold.
Residents from surrounding villages joined firefighters in the effort to put out the flames.
One man, Zafer al-Nakhlawi, said there had been 93 tents on the site, and only three remained standing.
Earlier reports put the death toll from the fire at three and gave a far higher number for the tents destroyed.
The Red Cross said six people were wounded; Ms Sleiman said two of them were in a critical condition.

http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-44716925,refugee,1 August 2018,By Alison Wilkins,School where refugees are the teachers,"Teaching his native Arabic to students online has been a game changer for Syrian refugee Sami as he makes a fresh start in the UK.
The Aleppo University engineering graduate says that working for an online language learning platform in London has helped him find his feet and motivation as he begins life anew.
The tutors at the start-up firm Chatterbox are all refugees and their work helps them to integrate and adapt to their new surroundings.
""I think language is building bridges between people, because the language is not only in the language itself, the speaking or the words, it's also the culture,"" said the 35-year-old refugee, who arrived in the UK about two years ago.
The school is the brainchild of Mursal Hedayat, who came up with the idea during a trip to refugee camps in Calais in the summer of 2016.
""I noticed that a lot of the people who were there and volunteering, were ordinary British people, but not a lot of them were actually from the kinds of backgrounds that the refugees had come from,"" she said.
A refugee herself - her family left Afghanistan when she was a small child - she noticed ""gaps in how people were helping, both in Calais and back home in the UK.""
""One of the gaps I noticed was that not a lot of the ventures helping refugees integrate economically, into work, had actually understood just how educated and skilled refugees in the UK were,"" she said.
""Think about how much we put into our social and professional lives and how much work goes into getting a degree, how much work goes into developing a successful career, and a lot of that experience, a lot of that human experience is erased, when we try to fit refugees into the same box of unskilled work.""
The idea for Chatterbox was born, and it has now grown to employ 30 refugees from countries including Syria, Afghanistan, and Iran, who work as tutors and conversation partners giving lessons to individuals, businesses and charities among others, in their native language - ranging from Arabic to Spanish.
Earlier this year, the start-up won the Varkey Foundation's educational technology award, which recognises innovations destined to have an impact on education in low-income and emerging economies.
Ms Hedayat says the award means the company now has part of the funding they are looking for to scale up the venture.
""An online technology business like ours can scale very well and easily, we want to grow to be able to benefit refugees and learners around the world.""
She wants to see the business move into new markets outside the UK, offer more courses and recruit more staff in countries ""where there are even fewer opportunities for refugees"".
Refugees who are working are ""able to benefit themselves and they are also able to contribute in taxes"", she says. They also bring a global outlook which can help companies wanting to compete overseas.
Ms Hedayat said that for many of Chatterbox's tutors, the work is ""about actually connecting with European society and European people, it's about learning about the country and the area that is their new home"".
""They genuinely find their conversations with students really interesting and a vehicle for them to integrate by acquiring knowledge about their new societies that they live in.""
""I think one of the problems about how refugee resettlement has worked up to now is that, we give refugees shelter but then we keep them siloed in geographical and social clusters that keep them isolated from the wider public,"" she says.
For Sami, tutoring has motivated him to go back into education.
He had been working in the United Arab Emirates but his company was forced to make lay-offs.
Unable to stay in the UAE, or return to his homeland, he came to the UK to ""start again from zero"".
Initially based in Aberdeen, he found an advert for Chatterbox online.
Ms Hedayat assisted him as he started a new life, introducing him to social activities and helping him to improve his English so that he could apply for a university course.
Sami is now studying for a masters at Warwick University, and when he graduates, is hoping to start working full-time.
In the meantime, he will keep sharing his language and culture.

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-45327058,refugee,1 September 2018,By Virginia Harrison,Nauru refugees: The island where children have given up on life,"Suicide attempts and horrifying acts of self-harm are drawing fresh attention to the suffering of refugee children on Nauru, in what is being described as a ""mental health crisis"". 
The tiny island nation, site of Australia's controversial offshore processing centre, has long been plagued with allegations of human rights abuses. 
But a series of damning media reports recently has also highlighted a rapidly deteriorating situation for young people.
""We are starting to see suicidal behaviour in children as young as eight and 10 years old,"" says Louise Newman, professor of psychiatry at the University of Melbourne who works with families and children on the island.
""It's absolutely a crisis."" 
Australia intercepts all asylum seekers and refugees who try to reach its shores by boat. It insists they will never be able to resettle in Australia, so over the years has sent many to privately run ""processing centres"" it funds on Nauru and in Papua New Guinea. 
Groups working with families on Nauru paint a brutal picture of life for children on the island. Many have lived most of their life in detention, with no idea of what their future will be. 
The trauma they have endured, coupled with poor - and often dangerous conditions - contribute to a sense of hopelessness.  
Natasha Blucher, detention advocacy manager at the Asylum Seeker Resource Centre (ASRC), was unable to share details of specific cases with the BBC due to privacy and safety concerns. 
But she said ASRC works with about 15 children who have either made repeated suicide attempts or are regularly self-harming. 
She also believes the problem has reached crisis point. 
ASRC, like most advocates and medical professionals, assist families on Nauru remotely as access to the island is heavily restricted. 
It estimates at least 30 children are suffering from traumatic withdrawal syndrome - also known as resignation syndrome. It's a rare psychiatric condition where sufferers, as a response to severe trauma, effectively withdraw from life. 
The condition can be life-threatening as victims become unable to eat and drink. 
""Around three months ago we were seeing a smattering of this... then over that period it seems to have proliferated,"" Ms Blucher told the BBC. 
Children ‘attempting suicide’ at Greek refugee camp
Prof Newman, a former advisor to the Australian government on the mental health of asylum seekers, says the outbreak of this very serious condition is particularly concerning. 
""In many ways it's not surprising… they are exposed to a lot of trauma there [and] a sense of hopelessness and abandonment. They feel very unsafe"". 
Another physician assisting with children's cases is GP Barri Phatarfod. Her organisation Doctors 4 Refugees has not been allowed to visit Nauru but receives referrals from advocates for assessment and advice. She says of the 60 cases referred to her organisation, every child has some mental health impairment. 
""It's impossible not to,"" she says. ""They witness suicide attempts almost daily as well as sexual harassment and physical and sexual abuse and there is no prospect of release."" 
At present most cases involve children from Iran, as well as kids from Iraq, Lebanon and Rohinyga. 
Dr Phatarfod adds that children as young as three are ""displaying inappropriately sexualised behaviour - behaviour that typically only comes from having this acted upon themselves"". 
One key proponent of the policy was the country's new prime minister, Scott Morrison, who rose to national prominence as a hardline immigration minister. Mr Morrison was one of the toughest enforcers of the divisive ""Stop the Boats"" policy and years later, becomes leader as unease over the treatment of asylum seekers hasn't abated.  
Supporters argue the policy has been highly effective, resulting in a dramatic drop in illegal boat arrivals. The government said a vessel that made land this week was the first boat carrying illegal asylum seekers to reach Australia since 2014. 
But critics point to the huge physical and mental toll exacted on the people placed in offshore detention facilities. 
In 2015, the site on Nauru became an ""open centre,"" meaning residents can come and go as they please. 
But this has done little to improve life for children on the island. The tiny Pacific island is just 21 sq km (8 sq miles) and covered with phosphate rocks. It was mined heavily and has few trees or animals. Advocates say even though the camp is technically open, there are few places for people to go. 
As the children's health crisis worsens, a coalition of human rights groups has demanded the Australian government remove the 119 asylum seeker children off Nauru and resettled them elsewhere. 
In a statement, the Australian government said it ""takes seriously its role in supporting the Government of Nauru to ensure that children are protected from abuse, neglect or exploitation"". 
""A range of care, welfare and support arrangements are in place to provide for the needs of children and young people,"" it said. 
Medical services including a hospital are available on Nauru but experts say they are inadequate. If a person needs more complex treatment, a referral must be made to the Nauruan government to have them transferred overseas for care. 
""When a person cannot receive appropriate treatment for a significant health condition in Nauru, the person is offered treatment in Taiwan, Papua New Guinea or Australia. Those cases are referred to the Department by the person's treating clinician,"" the Australian government said. 
Still, many argue the system of referrals is failing children on Nauru. Advocates say the process is too slow, and they are overwhelmed by the volume of children experiencing mental health problems. 
Jennifer Kanis, head of the social justice practice at law firm Maurice Blackburn, is leading several cases to bring urgent medical care to young people on the island. She believes that even though these children have never entered Australian territory, the Australian government has a duty of care. 
""It devastating… that we have to take legal action to get proper medical care for these kids,"" Ms Kanis says.   
""The government is more concerned with their policy of keeping this cohort of people seeking asylum off Australia than they are with their health.""

http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-38583519,refugee,11 January 2017,By Ken Macdonald,Refugee researcher faces the future,"A postgraduate researcher at Glasgow University is developing new technology designed to help people with paralysed faces.  
Mahmoud Amir Alagha is working in four dimensions to capture digitally the way partial paralysis affects people's expressions.  
His research is supported by the university which awarded him a scholarship and supported him when, as a refugee from the conflict in Syria, he applied for permission to stay in the UK. 
Mahmoud began studying in Glasgow in 2014 but was only able to complete his postgraduate course because he received a fee-waiver scholarship from the university.
The 28-year-old graduated with distinction in his Masters degree and hopes to take his research to a higher level.
He is currently applying to do his PhD and the UK government has given him leave to remain for five years. 
Mahmoud has been using technology developed in Scotland to capture 3D images of moving faces. 
""This is stepping into the fourth dimension,"" he says. ""Capturing 3D images over time.""
After capturing the images he superimposes a digital mask. 
""This mask is composed of points, could be thousands,"" Mahmoud says. 
""It is a mathematical construction so you can do decimation to make more points or reduce the number of points. 
""It depends how much is really clinically significant.""
Those thousands of reference points highlight how our faces move, or fail to move, because of injury, conditions such as Bell's Palsy or the aftermath of surgery, which can cause facial paralysis. 
Mahmoud say this technique could provide pointers to the correct treatment. 
He says: ""Muscles move the face. There are a very big number of muscles. 
""Being able to decode the face by region, for example, you can know that this muscle that is being supplied by that branch of the nerve is being affected because it is paralysed or is weak.
""Being able to study the region rather than the whole face, or both of them, gives us a new dimension into the management of these cases."" 
Mahmoud, who is from war-torn Aleppo, was half way through his masters degree when he became a refugee.
He says: ""By the end of the first year, the situation in Syria got mad. I had at some point to apply for asylum in the UK and the asylum process was harsh. 
""I could not afford the tuition fees for the second year. At that point I was stepping into the unknown. I felt like I was losing my solid ground.""
Ashraf Ayoub, professor of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery at Glasgow University, has been Mahmoud's mentor and supporter during his quest for refugee status.
He says: ""If it was rejected he would have been deported immediately. That would have been very dangerous for him and undermine what he had achieved in the first year and destroy him as a human being and as a potential scientific researcher.""
Practical support came from the university in the form of the scholarship, one of four given to refugee students.
Prof Ayoub says it has paid off handsomely.
He says: ""Number one, the enthusiasm. He wanted really to break the mould and innovate the application of this technology. 
""He also brought to it some of his own ideas of how we take this further. He also conducted a very successful pilot study as part of his Masters degree that he was awarded with distinction.""
Since the 1970s, the Glasgow Coma scale, developed by two Glasgow university professors at the Southern General has been the global standard for assessing patient consciousness.
Mahmoud wants to create a similar framework in his own field - the Glasgow Index of Facial Paralysis.
He says: ""How can you really diagnose a patient or not without being subjective, to say 'yes, there is improvement' or relying on a ruler to measure movement between two parts of the face? 
""Having something that will tell you precisely what movement is there, the speed, the direction, the pattern of movement, where you can compare before and after, that is something that will benefit the patients and will advance the management of these patients.""

http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-40454323,refugee,30 June 2017,None,Lebanon refugee camps hit by five suicide bombers,"Five militants have blown themselves up during a raid by Lebanese troops on refugee camps near the Syrian border, Lebanon's army said.
A young girl was killed and three soldiers wounded by the blasts. Four others were hurt when an attacker threw a hand grenade, the army said. 
It happened during an operation to search for militants and weapons in an area near the town of Arsal.
Arsal has often seen violence between troops and Sunni jihadists.
In the raid on Friday, four suicide bombers struck in one refugee camp, and a fifth struck in another camp, the army said.
Some 350 people were detained, including officials from the Islamic State (IS) group, Reuters news agency quoted a security source as saying.
The area is home to tens of thousands of refugees from the war in Syria. The influx has heightened sectarian tensions inside Lebanon since the conflict began in 2011.
A Sunni enclave surrounded by Shia villages, Arsal was the scene of an attack in 2014, when more than two dozen Lebanese security force members were seized by militants from al-Qaeda and IS who had crossed the border from Syria.
Sixteen have since been released and four killed by their captors.
Security forces say members of IS and jihadist group Jabhat Fateh al-Sham have a strong presence in and around the town. 
The groups are active in hills overlooking Arsal, where they were pushed back in an offensive by Syrian government and allied Shia Hezbollah forces in mid-2015.

http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-40365249,refugee,23 June 2017,By Catherine Byaruhanga,Why a Ugandan farmer gave land to a refugee,"In less than a year, a camp in northern Uganda has taken in more refugees than any other in the world, and all of them from war-torn South Sudan.
Here in Bidi Bidi it can take you one hour to drive from one end of the camp to the other. But it is not what you might envisage. 
Much of this place is lush, green and fertile. South Sudanese are given a plot of land to build a home and farm. They live next to Ugandans, fetch water together and their children go to the same schools. 
Most of the area is government-owned but some Ugandans have chosen to give part of their land to refugees, like 61-year-old Issa Agub. 
It is getting late when we arrive at his compound and his family is preparing porridge and beans over a firewood stove to break their Ramadan fast.
""I gave this land because the refugees are already here. I don't see them as strangers I see them as brothers. When I run out of food, they'll be the first people I turn to for help.""
Mr Agub says he cannot be sure how much land he owns but says he is helping 10-15 families.
According to the UN and other international organisations, Uganda has progressive laws towards refugees. 
The foundation for these policies was laid soon after the country's independence in 1962. At the time, thousands of ethnic Tutsis were fleeing genocide in neighbouring Rwanda and coming to Uganda. 
A new law was passed, the Control of Alien Refugees Act, which protected people fleeing persecution, gave refugees the right to work and created the first gazetted settlements or camps.
Since then the legislation has been updated and policies strengthened. Over the decades conflicts in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Rwanda, Somalia, Kenya and South Sudan have meant a constant stream of refugees into the country.
Uganda saw the largest number of refugees of any other country in 2016, UN figures show.
Many Ugandans have also had to flee their country because of conflict and know what it is like to be destitute. 
But the scale of the challenge today is like no other many here have faced. Since July, more than 700,000 South Sudanese have arrived. 
MP Hassan Kaps Fungaro says communities have been overstretched. 
""There is pressure on the resources on the ground. In the market, prices have gone up,"" he says.
""UN trucks bringing food have damaged our roads beyond recognition. UN and government jobs are being given to people who are not from the area.""
Protests have taken place over access to jobs for local youths. And many complain about the damage to the environment as trees were cut to make way for the refugees or firewood. 
At least two South Sudanese refugees told us that women had been stopped from collecting firewood.
But Mr Fungaro and others will tell you they do not want the refugees to be chased away.
Near Mr Agub's home a Ugandan couple - Joyce Anguko, a teacher and Geoffrey Aluma, a counsellor - are busy digging. 
They have come here from a nearby town. They could not find land there to grow crops and just like the new arrivals from across the border, Mr Agub has given them a small patch of land. 
Are they resentful of the South Sudanese refugees who are getting free plots of land?
Mr Aluma says: 'There is not much competition. People here are very hospitable because at one time we were refugees in South Sudan. They hosted us until there was peace in Uganda.""
Aid agencies and the government meanwhile say they are seriously short of funds to look after all of those in need. 
A pledging conference is taking place in Uganda to raise $2bn (£1.5bn) for the emergency response. 
Hunger is a common complaint as food rations were cut by half to 6kg (13lb) per person. 
Elias Kandus Emmanuel is the head teacher at Koro Highland Primary School in Bidi Bidi. 
""The young children do not attend classes. They come from home hungry, they doze in the classes and they even leave early.""
The refugees we spoke to told us they want to go back, where they can have better control of their destiny. 
After all, home is home. Uganda is generous and open but this a sticking plaster - the real solution is an end to war in South Sudan.

Aboud Kaplo, 14, was forced out of his home in Aleppo and is now living in Lebanon.
Film-maker Susie Attwood came across Aboud and saw his passion for music, but also his lack of an instrument.
Oxford University has now lent the teenager the restored violin.
The German-made violin is part of the Bate Collection of Musical Instruments, which has more than 2,000 examples of historic and modern instruments, tracing their development since the Middle Ages.
They can be used by academics, students and researchers, but for the first time an instrument from the collection is going to be lent to a young aspiring refugee musician.
Curator Andy Lamb said that ""the moment I read about this lad's situation"" he thought the collection ""could make some kind of positive contribution"".
""I immediately had an instrument in mind. It belonged to a former curator, Dr Helene Larue, a very generous person, and I knew that if she had been confronted with this situation, she would have donated an instrument instantly.""
Oxford University found about Aboud from film-maker and former student of the music faculty Susie Attwood.
She had met Aboud and his family at a Syriac Orthodox monastery, where she was making a film about Syrian Christian refugees in Lebanon, stuck in an ""in-between existence"", unable to find work or to provide an education for their children.
Aboud had a great interest in music and was trying to teach himself using YouTube videos and a ""rattly"" toy violin.
""Life is very difficult for Syrians living in Lebanon, but seeing how music provides such hope for someone like Aboud is very moving. I couldn't just let it go,"" said Attwood.
She contacted the university, and the Bate Collection immediately offered to help.

""The violin is not rare or ancient enough to be regarded as a precious resource, but it's significantly better than a cheap modern factory instrument, and it's entirely the kind of instrument we would lend to a student here at Oxford,"" said collection curator Mr Lamb.
Aboud said he ""cannot express by words how I feel - I'm so happy, so excited"".
""Playing the violin helps me express my feelings. I want to go on to study music and play on a big stage and travel the world.""

The estimated figure for the end of 2016 is an increase of 300,000 on 2015, according to its annual report.
It is a smaller increase than 2014-15, when the figure rose by five million.
But the UN high commissioner for refugees Filippo Grandi said it was still a disheartening failure of international diplomacy.
""The world seems to have become unable to make peace,"" Mr Grandi said. 
""So you will see old conflicts that continue to linger, and new conflicts erupting, and both produce displacement… forced displacement is a symbol for wars that never end.""
In 2016, some 340,000 people fled the violence in South Sudan into neighbouring Uganda. That was more than any other country - even more than the 200,000 people estimated to have fled Syria.
Just 36 hours after crossing the border by a simple wooden plank bridge, refugees are given a small plot of land and the materials they need to start growing their own food.
A year ago, the village of Bidi Bidi was just that, but now it is one of the biggest refugee settlements in the world - home to more than a quarter of a million people and covering 250 square kilometres.
The UN said it hoped Monday's record breaking numbers of displaced would encourage wealthy countries to think again: not just to accept more refugees, but to invest in peace promotion, and reconstruction. 
Mr Grandi also warned of the burden being placed on many of the world's poorest states, as some 84% of the world's displaced people are living in poor and middle income countries.
""How am I to ask countries with far less resources, in Africa, in the Middle East, in Asia, to take millions of refugees if the richer countries are refusing to do so?"" he said.

The ""Freital Group"", named after the suspects' hometown near Dresden, consists of seven men and a woman.
The German nationals are accused of targeting refugees and left-wing groups in 2015, causing two injuries.
The female suspect confessed to carrying out the attacks, while the men refused to speak in court.
The alleged members - aged between 19 and 39 - face life imprisonment if found guilty of attempted murder, and up to 10 years if the court rules they were part of a terrorist group.
Their names have not been publicly released.
""They wanted to create a climate of fear and repression,"" federal prosecutors said last year as they prepared the case.
""The aim of this group was to carry out bomb attacks on asylum-seeker shelters, as well as on the apartments, offices and vehicles of those with differing political views.""
The group is accused of targeting refugee accommodation in Freital and a left-wing housing project in Dresden with explosive devices in 2015.
In one of the assaults, the suspects threw explosives through the windows of a home for refugees, the prosecutors say.
The suspects are also alleged to have targeted a left-wing councillor's car in Dresden.
The trial is being held amid tight security.

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-45425872,refugee,6 September 2018,By Pallab Ghosh,Bell Burnell: Physics star gives away £2.3m prize,"One of the UK's leading female astronomers is to donate her £2.3m winnings from a major science prize she was awarded.
The sum will go to fund women, under-represented ethnic minority and refugee students to become physics researchers.
Prof Dame Jocelyn Bell Burnell has been awarded a Breakthrough Prize for the discovery of radio pulsars.
This was also the subject of the physics Nobel in 1974, but her male collaborators received the award.
The Breakthrough award also recognises her scientific leadership.
Prof Bell Burnell believes that under-represented groups - who will benefit from the donation - will bring new ideas to the field. 
""I don't want or need the money myself and it seemed to me that this was perhaps the best use I could put to it,"" she told BBC News.
Prof Bell Burnell's story has been both an inspiration and motivation for many female scientists. As a research student when pulsars were discovered, she was not included in the Nobel prize citation - despite having been the first to observe and analyse the astronomical objects (a type of neutron star that emits a beam of radiation).
She now says she wants to use her prize money to counter what she describes as the ""unconscious bias"" that she believes still occurs in physics research jobs. 
The former president of the Institute of Physics (IOP) believes that it was because she was from a minority group herself that she had the fresh ideas required to make her discovery as a young student at Cambridge University more than 50 years ago. 
""I found pulsars because I was a minority person and feeling a bit overawed at Cambridge. I was both female but also from the north-west of the country and I think everybody else around me was southern English,"" she said.
""So I have this hunch that minority folk bring a fresh angle on things and that is often a very productive thing. In general, a lot of breakthroughs come from left field."" 
Professor Dame Julia Higgins, president of the Institute of Physics, said: ""This is an excellent and hugely appropriate acknowledgement of Jocelyn's work. Her discovery of pulsars still stands as one of the most significant discoveries in physics and inspires scientists the world over. 
""Her example of using insight and tenacity to make a discovery that rings through the ages stands her alongside the greatest of scientists.
""Alongside her scientific achievement, Jocelyn has become a hugely respected leader in the scientific community. She has been instrumental in making sure the issue of access to science by people from under-represented groups is at the very top of the science community's agenda.""
The fine detail of the scholarship have yet to be decided. In addition to women and under-represented ethnic minorities, refugee applicants will also be eligible for a slice of the funding.
She said of these groups: ""Those are the people that tend to be discriminated against through unconscious bias so I think that's maybe one of the reasons why there aren't so many. And so if they come with some funding with them then they look much more attractive"".
Prof Bell Burnell has been diplomatic when asked about the Nobel Prize controversy. But she hopes that her scheme will play a part in changing the current disparity.
""There certainly has been a notable lack of women Nobel Prize winners, except maybe in areas like literature where you know there are women,"" she said.

General Terrence O'Shaughnessy said Operation Faithful Patriot would focus on Texas, Arizona and California.
President Donald Trump earlier said the ""invasion"" of migrants would find the US military waiting for them.
He also told Fox News that ""tent cities"" would be built to house migrants seeking asylum in the US.
""If they apply for asylum, we're going to hold them until such time as their trial takes place. We're going to hold them, we're going to build tent cities, we're gonna build tents all over the place,"" he said in an interview on Monday.
There are already 2,100 National Guard members at the border, sent after a previous request by Mr Trump in April.
Both sides of the US political divide have been accused of using the migrants for electoral gain just a week before Americans go to the polls.
In mid-term elections on 6 November, President Trump's Republican Party will seek to keep both houses of Congress out of Democratic hands.
The migrants are still around 1,000 miles (1,600km) from the US border.
Gen O'Shaughnessy said the troops would be deployed by the end of the week with weapons, helicopters, aeroplanes, barriers and miles of razor wire to support border patrol agents. 
Analysis by Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington
After a week in which guns and bombs dominated the headlines, Donald Trump seeks to return the focus on the migrants making their way through Mexico toward the US border. 
Their numbers may be dipping thanks to an offer of Mexican asylum and the length of the journey, but the president is sounding the alarm. 
The deployment of 5,000 soldiers to the border will probably have little tangible impact, given that the migrants plan to file legal requests for asylum. 
The urgency is questionable as well, given that it could be months before they arrive at the border. 
What the announcement represents, however, is clear. The president seeks to paint the refugees as a national threat that he alone is willing to counter.
At the moment immigration is not among the top concerns of American voters. The president, perhaps seeking political advantage, has eight days to change that.
US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) commissioner Kevin McAleenan also addressed Monday's news conference.
He told reporters the migrants were estimated to be several weeks away from reaching the US border.
The figure of 5,200 military personnel is higher than the 800 troops it was initially predicted would be sent.
The total military deployment means the number of troops at the south-western border will exceed the US troops currently in Syria and Iraq, the Wall Street Journal notes.
Mr Trump tweeted on Monday: ""Many Gang Members and some very bad people are mixed into the Caravan heading to our Southern Border.
""Please go back, you will not be admitted into the United States unless you go through the legal process. 
""This is an invasion of our Country and our Military is waiting for you!"" 
Many of the migrants say they plan to seek asylum in the US.
There is a legal obligation under international law to hear asylum claims from migrants who have arrived in the US if they say they fear violence in their home countries.
Those seeking asylum must be fleeing due to a serious fear of persecution in their home country. Under international law, these are considered refugees.
If an asylum seeker enters the US illegally, they are still entitled to a hearing of their claim.
Economic migrants are those seeking a better quality of life - and even if they are fleeing devastating poverty, they are not considered refugees and do not have the same protections.
Mr Trump is not the first president to send troops to the border with Mexico.
President Barack Obama sent some 1,200 National Guard soldiers to guard the boundary, while President George W Bush deployed about 6,000 troops to help Border Patrol in what was called Operation Jump Start.
Both deployments lasted for about a year.

http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-australia-38836424,refugee,3 February 2017,By Trevor Marshallsea,Refugee's medical emergency reignites debate in Australia,"As the US-Australia refugee deal dominated headlines this week, a medical emergency was unfolding at an Australian detention centre on the Pacific island of Nauru.
Advocacy groups have been pushing the Australian government to allow a Kuwaiti refugee, who is 37 weeks pregnant, to be flown to Brisbane to give birth by caesarean section. 
They say they alerted the government that she was a high-risk patient in December, due to the condition of pre-eclampsia, her baby being in the breech position, because of her age of 37 and because she had been prescribed the antidepressant citalopram, which can result in harmful side-effects on newborn babies. 
Known only as ""Dee"", the woman has been on Nauru since late 2013 and is now living in the local community after being deemed a genuine refugee.
However, with Australia having not approved her entry, the woman had remained in Nauru's general hospital. While previously refugees on Nauru were routinely allowed into Australia to give birth in better-equipped hospitals, Australia has been reluctant to allow the practice since 2015, fearing that once in the country refugees will seek legal help to remain here.
Finally on Friday, Dee was flown to Brisbane. According to Nauru's government, it came after Australia gave permission late on Thursday night.
Australia sends all asylum seekers who arrive by boat to detention centres in Nauru and Papua New Guinea's Manus Island. Those processed there and classed as genuine refugees have been released into the local communities. Children of asylum seekers who give birth in Australia are not automatically given visas or citizenship.
This ""Pacific Solution"" has been criticised by refugee advocacy groups, who say Australia - the sixth-largest country in the world geographically and with the seventh-lowest population density - could afford to show more compassion to asylum seekers and is obliged to do so under a UN convention.
The government, supported by the main opposition, argues boat journeys are dangerous and controlled by people-smugglers. It says its policies have restored the integrity of Australia's borders, prevented deaths at sea and discouraged people who aren't genuine refugees from making the journey.
It becomes still more complicated by the question of who should bear the responsibility in medical emergencies for those awaiting processing.
Canberra's reluctance to grant medical evacuations is not confined to problematic pregnancies. It has also been the case for refugees needing other treatment, such as an 11-year-old Iranian boy who was prevented from going to Australia for corrective surgery on a broken arm in 2015, despite a storm of protest.
Australia-based activist groups Doctors for Refugees and the Refugee Action Coalition say the government's delayed action over Dee was based on a fear of her remaining in Australia after her procedure, and showed again that the government was ready to put lives at risk to make a political point.
It was not immediately clear if her condition had changed before she was airlifted on Friday.
Doctors for Refugees President Dr Barri Phatarfod said Dee had been identified by a team of several Australia-based specialists assessing her medical tests as a high-risk patient requiring urgent transfer to Australia in December. But, Dr Phatarfod said, approaches to Australia's Immigration Minister Peter Dutton had been rebuffed.
""Either the minster, who is not an obstetrician, chose not to believe us, which would take a certain amount of arrogance, or else the government just doesn't care,"" Dr Phatarfod told the BBC.
""This is a very high-risk pregnancy, which requires medical assistance that simply cannot be provided on Nauru. The Australian government is putting politics above people's lives.
""Nauruan women with complicated pregnancies are allowed to be flown to Australia. But because Dee is a refugee, she's effectively a prisoner. Her choices have been taken away. She'll be delivering how the Australian government says she'll be delivering.""
Dr Phatarfod said despite promised funding from Australia to upgrade the Nauru hospital, the facility was still grossly inadequate for cases such as Dee's and operated by poorly trained staff. 
She said the woman also had a large fibroid, or benign tumour, on the front of her uterus. Cutting through such growths for a caesarean delivery usually resulted in substantial bleeding, and Dr Phatarfod said the Nauru hospital was not equipped to handle transfusions.
This issue has been in the spotlight in the past few years through several high-profile cases, including:
""After that [the Somali refugee's] case, who in their right mind would take this risk with this latest case?"" said Sydney-based Refugee Action Coalition spokesman Ian Rintoul.
""People on Nauru are hostage to politics. And Australia's two big political parties (Liberal and Labor) are both hostage to the offshore solution. There's no principled position by the two main political parties anymore.""
Australia's Department of Immigration and Border Protection has kept its statements on the case brief. Handling media enquiries via email, it said it did not ""provide specific details on the health and transfer arrangements of individuals"".
""Australia provides comprehensive medical support services to the regional processing centre in Nauru and to the Nauruan Government Health Facilities,"" a spokesman wrote in an email to the BBC.
""Refugees in Nauru are eligible to access the Government of Nauru Overseas Medical Referral process if required medical services are not available in Nauru. This process is under the management of the Government of Nauru.
""Decisions relating to medical treatment, including medical transfers, for refugees in Nauru are made at the discretion of the Government of Nauru.""
In a statement late on Thursday, Nauru's government said it had ""no control over decisions by Australia on who to transfer"".
""Within the last 30 minutes we have received confirmation from Australia that the patient [Dee] will be airlifted and this is expected to happen tomorrow,"" it said in a statement.
Nauru's government and Mr Rintoul confirmed Dee had boarded the plane early on Friday afternoon. Australia did not comment on Friday.
The Refugee Action Coalition says there are 1,800 people who have been determined to be refugees on Nauru and Manus. Australia's agreement with the US is for it to take up to 1,250 of them, although President Donald Trump's criticism of the deal means it is far from certain.
Even if all 1,250 were resettled, Mr Rintoul says this would still leave 550 in limbo on the Pacific islands, and continuing debate over their care.

http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/blogs-the-papers-38786231,refugee,29 January 2017,By UK staff,None,"Anyone looking to eat their breakfast on a Trump-free Sunday will be disappointed. 
The face of the US president is seldom absent. The Sunday Telegraph alone carries five photographs and a cartoon of the newest occupant of the Oval Office. The Sun on Sunday also has five photos, although Trump is eclipsed by six pictures of David Beckham on a single page, ahead of his appearance on BBC Radio 4's Desert Island Discs.
Some coverage of Trump's first week in the White House is scathing. The Observer concludes that the president ""cannot be trusted"" on issues that affect Britain, describing him as ""ignorant, prejudiced and vicious in ways that no American leader has been"". 
It reports the case of a Yazidi woman who fled an ""Isis massacre in Iraq"", but was not allowed to board a flight to the US to be reunited with her husband.
Sunday Mirror columnist  Saira Khan describes Trump's policies as ""damaging, isolationist, racist, sexist, Islamophobic, backward"", and likely to trigger an ""economic arms race"" of tit-for-tat tariffs.
But in The Sunday Times, historian Niall Ferguson writes that while Trump is a ""self-publicist of prodigious talent"", it is important to distinguish his messages to his supporters from the actual process of governing. No-one, writes Ferguson, is yet in a position to know how a Trump presidency will turn out.
The spectacle of President Trump holding hands with the prime minister in the White House continues to fascinate. The Sunday Telegraph has a cartoon of a serene-looking Mr Trump locking hands with a rather less relaxed Theresa May on one side, and a bare-chested Vladimir Putin on the other, as they gambol through a meadow.
There's a possible explanation in The Sunday Express as to why the president took Mrs May's hand - and the answer may not be chivalry, as Downing Street has suggested. The paper says it has learned that Mr Trump has a fear of slopes and stairs, known as ""bathophobia"", and he merely needed a steadying arm.
The Mail on Sunday takes aim at what it calls a ""ludicrous, politically correct directive to placate the transgender lobby"". It says the British Medical Association has told NHS doctors not to call pregnant women ""expectant mothers"", in case the term offends transgender people.
A spokesperson from a transgender support group tells the Mail that the advice to doctors is a ""massive step forwards"" in preventing discrimination.  But the paper's leader column says transgender campaigners are not entitled to force their opinions about changing language on to others.
The Sun on Sunday has a warning about a new obesity epidemic - but there's not a hamburger or sugar-packed smoothie in sight. The paper reports a survey which suggests cars are getting heavier.
Bigger engines, tyres, extra equipment and safety devices such as air bags mean some cars have doubled in weight since they were launched, decades ago.  The new Mini, for example, is now more of a maxi, being more than eighty per cent heavier than the lightweight original.

http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-37803531,refugee,3 November 2016,None,Refugee worker racially abused protesters,"A pro-refugee campaigner racially abused counter demonstrators at a rally to welcome Syrian refugees to Scotland, a court has heard.
Shafiq Mohammed was also found to have resisted arrest at a demonstration in Monkton, South Ayrshire, in 2015.
The 50-year-old former Scottish Refugee Council worker was said to have verbally abused a woman and three men.
However, the sheriff did not formally proceed to conviction of the accused in respect of the charges.
At Ayr Sheriff Court, Sheriff Weir said he would consider a submission from Mr Mohammed's lawyer under section 246 of the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995 when a further hearing is held in December.
He adjourned the case for the preparation of a criminal justice social work report.
During the court case, the sheriff heard how tempers flared as members of the far-right anti-immigration Scottish Defence League staged a counter demonstration against pro-refugee demonstrators on 15 November last year.
It followed 150 refugees being granted emergency accommodation at the Ayrshire town's Adamton Country House Hotel.
Mr Mohammed was said to have shouted that the group were ""nothing but white bastards"".
He denied behaving in a racially aggravated manner which was intended to cause alarm and distress.
Mr Mohammed claimed the four witnesses had conspired to make up the allegations against him.
Sheriff Robert Weir QC found that Mr Mohammed had behaved in the manner outlined in the charges but opted to reserve his verdict, adjourning the case until December.
He said it had been a ""troubled case"" and said the atmosphere at the rally had been ""rendered toxic by other people"".
The sheriff told Mr Mohammed his actions were ""to be deplored"".
The court heard Mr Mohammed had previously worked for property firm Orchard & Shipman, which has been paid more than £60m to house refugees in Scotland.
He is currently involved in the Asylum Seeker Housing (ASH) Project - an organisation campaigning on asylum seeker housing issues in the west of Scotland.

Rami, 21, was a music student and left the city of Homs in 2015. He now lives in Germany, after crossing eight countries, often on foot.
During his journey through Europe, he was thrown off a train and lost his violin while being chased by police.
But in Germany, he was given another instrument after sharing his story.
The musician travelled through Lebanon and Turkey to Istanbul. From there he crossed to Greece by boat, carrying his violin wrapped in cling film.
While making the journey, the engine of the boat broke down, and he was rescued by the Greek coast guard and taken to the island of Kos, where many refugees were being housed. 
""I slept together with the violin because I was scared of someone stealing it,"" he said in a video posted by Decca Records, which will release the album, called My Journey.
From Kos, he went on to Athens and then to Macedonia, where he caught the attention of journalists while playing his violin.
Initially, he said, he performed Arabic music. Then he played Beethoven's Ode To Joy, the first track of the album, and also the European Union's official anthem.
Next, Rami went to Serbia, where, according to the video account, he was punished for talking to the media about the bad conditions in which they were being kept. 
He was separated from his friends and spent days without food or water.
Rami was released only after a police officer noticed his violin. ""He asked me to play for him, so I played. This made him very happy.""
The hurdles did not end in Serbia. While crossing from Belgrade to Budapest, in Hungary, he was thrown out of the train by police and continued his journey on foot with a friend, who was carrying the violin.
But when the police chased them, both ran in different directions, and Rami ended up losing his instrument. He was later caught by police and sent to a camp.
The situation there was bad, he recalled. He decided to leave the camp and walk through the night to Austria.
The violinist then went on to Munich, in southern Germany, and finally to Sasbachwalden, where he found refuge.
""There was a woman who was helping the people [and] and I told her my story,"" he said.
""She introduced me to a maestro called Jochen Lemme and he gave me a violin as a gift."" 
1. Rami leaves Homs in 2015; 2. Travels through Lebanon; 3. Reaches Istanbul, in Turkey; 4. Is rescued by Greece's coast guard and taken to Kos; 5. Reaches Athens; 6. In Serbia, is punished for speaking to journalists and separated from his friends; 7. Is thrown out of a train while crossing from Serbia to Hungary; 8. Reaches Austria after leaving refugee camp in Hungary; 9. Reaches Munich, in Germany; 10. Arrives in Lahr, where he started practising at a local church
From there, Rami says he later moved to Lahr, where he lived in a sports hall which housed more than 200 families. A local church allowed him to practise and a picture of him was published in the local newspaper.
After reading the story, a couple offered him accommodation in their house, where he would be able to rehearse.
""I think he can't imagine life without his violin,"" said Theresia, who welcomed him into her home.
Rami recorded My Journey with award-winning producers James Morgan and Juliette Pochin.
It features traditional Arabian music from his roots alongside a classical version of the song Counting Stars, by American band OneRepublic, and a rendition of Silent Night.
The album is being digitally released in support of a Red Cross campaign to help people in crisis around the world.

A note on terminology: The BBC uses the term migrant to refer to all people on the move who have yet to complete the legal process of claiming asylum. This group includes people fleeing war-torn countries such as Syria, who are likely to be granted refugee status, as well as people who are seeking jobs and better lives, who governments are likely to rule are economic migrants.

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-39801464,refugee,9 May 2017,By Andreas Illmer,The Japanese manga comic helping Syrian refugee children dream,"""The situation in Syria is terrible - so terrible that I think it stops kids from dreaming. But it's their dreams that one day will make Syria good again,"" says Obada Kassoumah. 
""I wish I could just give them a little bit of hope and make them believe that yes, they can have dreams.""
Obada is a Syrian student in Tokyo who, by a mixture of chance and determination, has become the translator of Japanese manga comics into Arabic. 
And by another twist of fate, many of these Arab editions of football saga Captain Tsubasa have been donated to aid agencies and are being handed out to Syrian refugee children across Europe and the Middle East. 
For Obada, the project started as an unexpected translation job but has become something very personal and important. 
As a student of Japanese at university in the Syrian capital, Damascus, Obada received a scholarship to go to Japan for an exchange programme. That was in 2012, and the unrest in the country had already started. 
The situation got worse and worse and often he would be stopped by the police in the street suspecting that as a young man he might be a rebel fighter. 
When the situation got too dangerous, his parents decided to send him to live with his aunt in Jordan until he could leave for Tokyo.
It was almost already too late - it was only through personal connections that he managed to cross the border. 
When his scholarship ended a year later, he was able to stay in Japan by enrolling as a regular student, and picked up a part-time job translating Captain Tsubasa. 
""I myself watched Captain Tsubasa as a kid on TV and I loved it,"" says 26-year old Obada.
""It's a story about a kid having a dream to become a professional football player and working hard to make that dream come true.
""And that's something beautiful, that's something you should make these kids see.""
Initially, adapting the books for the Arab market was a mere business decision by a Japanese publisher.
But they were then approached by Prof Masanori Naito, a Middle East specialist at Doshisha University in Kyoto. 
Prof Naito had spent several years in Damascus as a doctoral student in the 1980s and was looking for ways to help people affected by the conflict. 
He suggested the publisher could donate some of the manga books to refugee kids.
""The tragedy of Syria,"" he says, ""is a very serious concern to me. Back then I worked in villages that are now held by the rebel forces."" 
The original copyright holders in Japan, Shueisha publishers, were immediately ready to fund the donations, he said.  
Through co-operation with a number of international NGOs and Unicef, the books are now being distributed to young Syrian children in camps across Europe, Turkey and the Middle East who have escaped the terror and trauma of the civil war ravaging their home country. 
""It is very far from the reality they know,"" Prof Naito explains. ""But for kids it is very important to be able to escape from reality for a while. And these books can also give them some hope for their own future.""
Manga he says, could even be ""a tool of soft power against despair and radicalisation"".
One of the places where Captain Tsubasa now provides a small escape from reality is a refugee home in Berlin where just last week, the copies were handed out by German-Turkish NGO Wefa to around 60 refugees. 
""It was really something quite unique and we got a completely different reaction from normal,"" Ismet Misirlioglu of Wefa told the BBC from Berlin.
""What the children usually get are of course clothes and food and so they were really surprised when we suddenly had Japanese manga books - in their own language,"" he says, laughing. 
""And you really could tell that from their eyes!"" 
Wefa in Berlin is planning to give out more of the books in the coming weeks. 
Back in Tokyo, Obada Kassoumah is still at work putting ever more adventures of Captain Tsubada into Arabic. He is currently translating volume seven out of 37. 
For him, going back to Syria is not an option. 
Instead, he will stay in Japan for now and finish his degree - he knows Syria will need his skills in the future and he hopes he can have a bigger impact if he works building links between the two countries.
""I have friends who are fighting with the government and other friends who are fighting with the rebels,"" he says with a heavy voice.
""We are all one family - and now they wish death to each other, trying to kill each other.""
But he hopes his translations will put a smile on the face of a Syrian child somewhere, trying to forget the terror of the past.
""As a Syrian it's like my duty to help - and through this thing I can help.
""This way the children can - at least for a bit - forget all the bad memories they have from the war.""

Prosecutors in Frankfurt said the 28-year-old suspect was motivated by a ""xenophobic background"".
A student, 22, said to be a co-conspirator, has also been arrested.
The soldier was first detained by Austrian police in February after he tried to retrieve a handgun he had hidden in a toilet at Vienna airport.
He was released but police subsequently discovered the suspect had registered as a Syrian refugee at a shelter in central Germany in December 2015 and later officially requested political asylum in Bavaria, prosecutors said.
No concerns were raised at the time, despite the man speaking no Arabic. German media report that he even received monthly payments and accommodation.
""These findings, and indications of a xenophobic background of the Bundeswehr soldier, suggest that the accused was planning a serious crime endangering state security with the weapon that was earlier deposited at Vienna airport,"" the prosecutors' statement said, according to AFP news agency.
The gun is reported not to have come from the German armed forces.
The man is a lieutenant normally stationed on a base near Strasbourg in north-east France, but he was arrested in Hammelburg in Bavaria, southern Germany, on Wednesday.
Police searched 16 properties in Germany, France and Austria on the same day. Items banned under weapons and explosives laws were found in the student's home in Offenbach, near Frankfurt. Offenbach is also the soldier's hometown.

http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-39712431,refugee,26 April 2017,By Peter Coulter,Safe return review refugee policy 'beyond basic morality',"Fifty organisations from across the UK who work with refugees have written to Home Secretary Amber Rudd calling on her to reverse a policy that they say is ""beyond basic morality"". 
Refugees will now take part in a ""safe return review"" five years after their refugee status is granted. 
The review will decide if refugees are able to stay in the UK or will return to their home country. 
The Home Office said it could not comment because of ""purdah"" rules.
These limit government activity during the pre-election period.
The department issued updated guidance on the process by which refugees already living in the UK apply to stay here permanently. 
Under the policy, all those who apply for settlement will be subject to a so-called ""safe return review"" to check the current situation in their home country. 
Campaigners claim the measures would ""put an end to hope of stability"" and end any possibility of refugees being able to integrate into society. 
Organisations that have signed the letter include Black Lives Matter UK, the Northern Ireland Community of Refugees and Asylum Seekers, the Scottish Refugee Council, Migrant Voice, Space4U Cardiff, Manchester Migrant Solidarity and Calais Action. 
Makhosi Sigabade, a refugee from Zimbabwe living in Belfast, was awarded refugee status in December. 
He told the BBC he was now facing an uncertain five years. 
""After being given a false sense of hope and stability, I am being made to relive the nightmares of my past,"" he said. 
""I am now confronted with a possibility of going back to face the same persecution from which I fled. 
""I've been taking a Tefl [teaching English as a foreign language] course and trying to get work but with these changes I don't know if I'll be allowed to stay.""
Colin Harvey, professor of human rights at Queen's University Belfast, is one of the signatories to the letter.
""These are troubling times,"" he said. ""The very idea of human rights is under threat.
""In times such as these we must stand together in support of the global regime of refugee protection and we must ensure that the rights of refugees are not undermined.""
Luke Butterly, from the Belfast-based Participation and the Practice of Rights organisation which also signed the letter, said the new policy was ""inhuman"". 
""We're asking Amber Rudd to listen to the voices put forward in this letter and recognise that this policy will have a devastating impact on people's lives and will cost the Home Office an awful lot of money and serves no interest in the public good,"" he said.
Home Office guidance states that ""all those who apply for settlement protection after completing the appropriate probationary period of limited leave will be subject to a safe return review with reference to the country situation at the date the application is considered"".
""Those who still need protection at that point will normally qualify for settlement,"" it adds.
They added that safe return reviews were introduced in February 2016.
On Tuesday, the all-parliamentary group on refugees published a report saying thousands of refugees face homelessness and destitution because of a ""two-tier"" UK system.

The protest in Downing Street on Friday evening was against the American attack on a Syrian airbase.
Hassan Akkad, from Damascus, asked why the group was not protesting against President Assad instead, but was drowned out.
He said: ""British people not letting a Syrian say something about Syria in a protest about Syria. It's mad.""
The 29-year-old said he had wanted to be the voice of Syrians who were still in the country but left the protest ""livid"".
Stop the War was founded in September 2001, after US president George W Bush announced a ""war on terror"".
After a video of the encounter was shared widely online, Mr Akkad told the BBC: ""I didn't see them protesting against the chemical attacks, I didn't see them protesting against Putin bombing Syria for the last two years. 
""I wanted to go to that protest and I wanted to observe. 
""I went to the protest and I saw a group of 30 people with placards, not a single mention of Assad.
""All the placards are against Donald Trump and they're repeating baseless slogans with their megaphones.""
He added: ""I went to them respectfully and said, 'Listen I'm a Syrian refugee who lives here and I have an opinion, it's a protest about Syria I want to say something'. 
""They didn't even address me, they ignored my existence. With their megaphones they went louder and louder and the organisers told them to carry on.""
Mr Akkad left Syria in September 2015. He says he was imprisoned twice and tortured for protesting against Assad's regime.
He left his family there and made an 87-day journey to the UK.
Mr Akkad said when the US launched its attack on a Syrian airbase, it did so with ""great accuracy"" whereas, he said, Assad's bombers ""literally shred people down"".
""They [President's Assad's forces] have killed hundreds of thousands, we've lost our home, we were displaced, we were made refugees all because of the Assad regime,"" he said.
""People were tortured to death, chemical attacks, all sort of attacks barrel bombs shredding children and flattening down entire cities.
""So bombing Assad's war machines is in our favour because that means less Syrian civilians will die, less children will die.""
After the group would not let Mr Akkad speak, he said: ""I felt oppressed, it was like being back in Syria. Like how the Syrian police used to mute our voices. 
""I'm not going to be silenced I have the right to say what I believe. 
""I left the protest. I was angry, I was livid.""
A spokeswoman for Stop the War said: ""This was an anti-war protest. There are Syrians who support Western bombing of Syria, and Syrians who oppose it. 
""Those who support it have protests calling for intervention. This was an anti-intervention event. Of course his voice can and should be heard. 
""But it would be strange if Stop the War gave a platform to people who supported bombing.""

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-45933845,refugee,22 October 2018,None,Trump vows to cut aid over migrant caravan,"President Donald Trump has said the US will ""begin cutting off"" foreign aid to Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador because of a large convoy of migrants heading north.
Mr Trump criticised the countries on Monday for allowing people to leave the region and come ""illegally"" to the US.
The group is travelling through Mexico, but is still far from the US border.
Human rights organisations have said that cutting aid would make the situation worse. 
The president has not specified what money will be cut and it is unclear if such action can be taken by presidential order. 
Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador were not able to do the job of stopping people from leaving their country and coming illegally to the U.S. We will now begin cutting off, or substantially reducing, the massive foreign aid routinely given to them.
End of Twitter post  by @realDonaldTrump
In 2017, Guatemala received over $248m (£191m) in US aid. The same year, Honduras received $175m and El Salvador $115m, according to the US Agency for International Development.
""Cutting aid to refugee-producing countries will only make worse the conditions that displace people in the first place,"" said Human Rights Watch on Sunday. 
The organisation said root causes must be addressed. ""People generally don't want to leave their homes if they can live normal, safe lives there.""
Though President Trump has accused the migrants of trying to illegally enter the US, many of the families travelling towards the border are seeking asylum.
They say they are fleeing persecution, poverty and violence in their home countries.
By the BBC's Aleem Maqbool in Mexico 
The square in Tapachula - the first major population centre inside Mexico for these migrants - has turned into what looked like a makeshift camp. Along one side, ambulances lined up so medics could treat those who had become sick or got injured on their journey. 
Mexicans came to offer food, water and clothes to the many hundreds of Hondurans who rested ahead of the long punishing journey that still remains ahead of them to the US border. 
Many women among the group in particular have told us that they could never have made this journey alone, because it would have been too dangerous. So in spite of their tiredness, they are glad to be with others. 
But there is a sense that this is no longer just a convoy of those here in Tapachula, but that there is now a long stream of people stretching back along the route through Guatemala to Honduras, with people stuck at various obstacles and others who are still coming to join this migration.
Curbing illegal immigration was one of the main campaign promises Mr Trump made when he ran for president.
His Republican Party is facing mid-term elections on 6 November and could be unseated by Democrats in the House of Representatives. 
Without offering evidence, Mr Trump has repeatedly suggested the caravan was politically motivated. 
On Monday he urged people to blame Democrats for the border crisis, saying: ""Remember the mid-terms"".
He also tweeted that the caravan contained ""criminals and unknown Middle Easterners"". When he was later pressed by journalists on what this meant, he offered no origin for the claim but invited reporters to investigate for themselves.
On Sunday, the migrant caravan reached the town of Tapachula, approximately 37km (23 miles) from Mexico's southern border with Guatemala.
The Mexican authorities had earlier tried to stop them at a border bridge, but some managed to cross into Mexico illegally by boat over the Suchiate river. 
""We have sunburn. We have blisters. But we got here. Our strength is greater than Trump's threats,"" migrant Britany Hernández told AFP news agency. 
It is expected to take weeks before the caravan reaches the US-Mexico border, according to US media. 
One of the closest border crossings in Brownsville, Texas is still over 1,000 miles (1,600 km) away from Tapachula.
The last leg of their journey will also have to wait until Mexico processes the group, and asylum claims can take up to 45 days. 
A group of about 1,000 Hondurans set off on foot from a bus terminal in the crime-ridden city of San Pedro Sula on 13 October in an attempt to escape unemployment and the threat of violence.
Many of them had become aware of the caravan after a former lawmaker had published a poster announcing the caravan on Facebook. News of it quickly spread on social media. 
They have since been joined by other Central American nationals as they crossed Guatemala towards the Mexican border.
The region has one of the highest murder rates in the world and many try to flee gang violence.
The exact number is hard to determine as the group has split up. Some are already in the Mexican city of Tapachula, while others are still at the Guatemala-Mexico border.
Some estimates put the number of migrants who left Ciudad Hidalgo for Tapachula on Sunday at 5,000 while a Mexican federal police commander gave a lower number of 3,000. Another 1,500 migrants are estimated to be waiting to cross at the Guatemalan side of the border.
A newly formed group of 1,000 mainly Honduran migrants has set off for the US, as well. 
However, 3,400 Hondurans have also turned back, according to official figures.
Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernández urged citizens not to join the caravan. His country has also sent buses to the Mexico-Guatemala border to repatriate those who may have changed their minds about heading to the US or who are simply too exhausted to carry on.
Mexico said it would stop those who did not have passports or the correct visas at its southern border. But faced with thousands of migrants and after initial clashes, riot police got back on the buses that had brought them to the border bridge.
About 900 migrants crossed the river and made it into Mexico, without the police intervening. 
On Monday, incoming Mexican Secretary of Foreign Affairs Marcelo Ebrard - who will take up the post on 1 December - told reporters that Mr Trump's tweets were linked with domestic politics.
""The tweets we've been seeing lately do not surprise me, they do not surprise the government,"" he said via an interpreter, according to Reuters news agency.
""It's very close to the mid-term elections in the United States,"" Mr Ebrard said after meeting with Canada's foreign minister in Ottawa.
Mr Ebrard did not answer when asked directly about how Mexico will treat the caravan, but said that his country planned changes to its immigration policy.
""There are going to be many more work visas. We are going to invest in Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador,"" he said. 
Mexican officials say they have been encouraging the migrants to apply for asylum and that more than 1,000 have started the process. Those whose claims are rejected by Mexican officials will be deported.
Those who managed to cross into Mexico expressed their joy at having it made that far. Many shouted ""Yes, we could!"" and ""we won't stop"".
""We're exhausted, it's been a terribly difficult journey but we have hope: we've made it to Mexico, which means a lot to us,"" a migrant called José Luis told BBC Mundo.
A woman called María, who is taking part in the caravan with her husband and her two small children, told BBC Mundo's Ana Gabriela Rojas: ""We are very happy to be here and we ask Mexican authorities and people to let us pass through. We are just looking for a job and better living conditions.""

http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-38144448,refugee,30 November 2016,None,"Child refugee has 'no help, no school'","BBC Scotland has learned an unaccompanied Syrian child refugee who was brought to Scotland has no access to school or a social worker.
In the first interview with a Syrian child who has travelled here alone, Ahmed, 15, said he had not been offered any help from Glasgow City Council.
He joined his uncle in the city almost two months ago, but appears to have ""slipped through the net"".
He had spent a year in the Calais migrant camp known as the ""Jungle"".
The local authority said it would try to rectify the situation as ""quickly as possible"".
Ahmed has not been to school for three years after so-called Islamic State invaded his home city of Raqqa.
He was brought to Scotland under the EU's Dublin regulation, which allows unaccompanied refugee children to be placed in a country where they have a relative who can be responsible for their care.
Local authorities in the UK have a duty to provide unaccompanied children with a case worker and access to education.
Glasgow City Council said they would be working with Ahmed and his family. 
A spokesman said: ""We are fully committed to delivering positive outcomes for this vulnerable group of young people.
""We aim to support them to integrate successfully into their new communities and access to education is a key part of that effort. 
""Whenever an issue is identified with an individual case we will look to rectify that issue as quickly as possible.""
Scotland has been praised for ""leading the way"" in efforts to resettle refugees by Westminster's Home Affairs select committee.
Kirsty McNeill, director of policy, advocacy and campaigns for Save The Children, said people should not lose confidence in Scotland's level of care for refugees as a result.
She said: ""We were extremely disappointed to hear this because we don't think it is very common.
""In fact, we've held up Scotland as a beacon in how child refugees can be integrated and so we were surprised to hear it and disappointed. But we don't think anyone should lose confidence in the system as a result of it.""
Scotland has welcomed 1,200 Syrian refugees in the past 12 months under the UK's resettlement programme.
The UK as a whole is committed to resettling 20,000 Syrian refugees through its Vulnerable Persons Resettlement (VPR) scheme by 2020.
Ahmed was 14 years old when he began the journey from Raqqa in Syria to Glasgow.
In the first interview with an unaccompanied Syrian child refugee, Ahmed tells Fiona Walker from BBC Scotland's Investigation Unit why he decided to make the dangerous journey alone.
""There was continuous air bombing and we were living under Daesh rule. They scared us. It was awful. I was so afraid. I stayed indoors all the time. They were horrible people, they tortured, imprisoned and beheaded many people.""
His parents could not afford to send the whole family away, so they decided Ahmed would leave Raqqa with his father's cousin.
""l left Syria for Turkey at 2am. We crossed the border and after we crossed the barrier, the Turkish soldier shot into the air and caught us. They took me to a kind of prison - like a place for animals -  a concrete circle with barbed wire -  there were about 2000 people detained inside it, it was so overcrowded.""
They were returned to Syria, where they met a smuggler. They travelled to Greece by boat, made their way across Macedonia, ending up at the notorious ""Jungle"" refugee camp in Calais, where Ahmed was separated from his father's cousin.
""I stayed in Calais a year and seven days. It was freezing,"" he says.
""They gave us a tent and blankets, then we set up a wooden room to keep us from the cold. We tried many times to cross to the UK in a lorry. I have injuries but the scars have faded away. 
""These,"" he says showing his hands, ""are from when I tried to climb the four-meter fence with barbed wire to cross into the seaport."" 
""Then an organisation asked me to bring my documents to help me enter the UK.""
Ahmed joined his uncle in Glasgow, but since arriving in the city two months ago he says he has received no support from the city council.
""No one is helping me in Scotland,"" he says.
Ahmed is thankful he has found refuge, but fears for his family back home.
""My family are living in Raqqa in a dangerous situation. My father has escaped to another city now because he is wanted by ISIS and they want to execute him because he was a cigarette-seller.
""I haven't seen my family for about 14 months, I miss them so much and I dream of seeing them again.""

Yusra Mardini and her sister Sara were forced to swim for hours alongside their overloaded boat as it crossed from Turkey to Greece.
Yusra later competed for the first ever Refugee Olympic Team at the 2016 games.
UK production company Working Title has agreed to buy the rights to her story for a film that Stephen Daldry is tipped to direct.
""It's rather important that we find someone who can act and swim,"" he told the Daily Mail.
Mardini, 18, the daughter of a swimming coach, left her hometown with her sister in 2015 after their house was destroyed in the Syrian conflict.
Her remarkable 25-day journey took her to Beirut in Lebanon, across the Aegean Sea and finally to Germany.
In the final part of the journey, Mardini, Sara and another young woman dragged the broken-down boat full of refugees - many of whom could not swim - towards the shore, clinging to a rope dangling from the side.
Mardini's first German home would temporarily be a refugee camp, and one of her first questions in this unfamiliar city concerned finding the nearest swimming pool. 
An Egyptian translator put the sisters in touch with Wasserfreunde Spandau 04, one of Berlin's oldest swimming clubs.
""They saw our technique, saw it was good, they accepted us,"" she says.
After training there, she became one of two Syrians to be chosen by the International Olympic Committee for its first refugee team.
She won her qualifying heat in the 100 metres butterfly, though her time was not quick enough for her to progress.
""This is just a great story about a kid with an ambition, just like Billy Elliot,"" said Working Title's Eric Fellner.
Daldry received an Oscar nomination in 2001 for directing Billy Elliot and went on to direct the West End musical version.

UZINYC, which describes itself as a ""nomadic asphalt sweatshop"", sparked outcry after advertising the dress in black, navy and cream for $119 (£90). 
Twitter users accused the retailer of the ""fetishisation of refugees"" and cashing in on a humanitarian crisis.
The garment, though still available, now appears under a different name.
""You don't see anything problematic with calling this a 'refugee dress'?"" wrote Twitter user Alice Doyle. 
""Srsly? #Refugees are neither 'nomads' nor a sales gimmick. #UZINYC: apologise, rename dress, donate to #UNHCR, #IRC,"" wrote Julie Tippens.
Others said the move by the retailer was ""tasteless"", ""disgusting"" and ""beyond offensive"".
As people started directing questions at UZINYC over its marketing choice, they reported being blocked from contacting the retailer on social media.
""@uziuzinyc blocked me when I asked why they named their collection refugee dresses - where's the logic?"" wrote Teuta.
UZINYC said the garment was initially named the ""refugee dress"" in 2007, at the height of the global financial crisis, with the aim of stimulating debate on the issue.
The Brooklyn retailer told the Huffington Post UK that the dress was ""our vision of the future"" based on ""mass migration, climate change and increased economic disparity"".
""We feel that it is important to keep these issues within public discourse,"" the retailer said. 
Following the backlash, the ""refugee dress"" was later renamed the ""Oxford dress"".

Charles Wesco was in a car with his wife, son, another missionary and a driver on their way to a market in the city of Bamenda when he was shot.
He was caught in cross-fire between the security forces and separatist fighters, a government statement said.
The country's two English-speaking provinces have been hit by more than a year of deadly violence.
The government has blamed the rebels for killing Mr Wesco, saying its troops had killed the four fighters responsible.
Defence Minister Joseph Beti Assomo said the 44-year-old cleric was targeted by rebels planning to attack a nearby university.
But an Anglophone separatist group, which wants to form a breakaway state called Ambazonia, said government soldiers were to blame for the killing.
Hundreds have died in violence in Cameroon's North-West and South-West since October 2016 - many of these in the main city of Bamenda.
Mr Wesco, 44, had moved with his family to Bambili, which is on the outskirts of Bamenda, from the US state of Indiana.
The Wesco family had spent years raising funds for their move to Cameroon, said Pastor Dave Halyaman of the US-based Believers Baptist Church, which sent the family on the mission.
He told the BBC that Mr Wesco's wife, Stephanie, had described her husband's death as a tragedy but she said that she believed God allowed it for a purpose.
He said the church was being assisted by the US State Department in their efforts to bring the Wesco family home to the US ""hopefully in a week or less"".

Mr Modamani, 19, became a social media star after taking the photo in 2015.

Facebook deleted some malicious posts but Mr Modamani wanted an injunction forcing the company to actively identify and remove such posts rather than wait for users to flag them.
However the Wuerzburg court ruled that although the posts were ""undisputable defamation"", Facebook had not created the slanderous content itself, and so was not required to actively seek and delete the posts.
Mr Modamani is taking German classes and working in a restaurant, and said the fake posts about him were damaging, AFP news agency reported.
Lawyers for the social media giant had argued that, with billions of postings each day, the company would need ""a sort of wonder machine"" to detect each misuse. They said it was the individuals who posted the images who should be held responsible.
Mr Modamani's lawyer argued that Facebook had the technical ability to detect and block other content, such as pornography. 
Facebook has faced criticism over its handling of fake news stories and recently launched filtering systems in the US, Germany and France.
It comes amid suggestions that fake news reports influenced the outcome of the US presidential election.

http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-37859093,refugee,4 November 2016,By Kelly-Leigh Cooper,From Aleppo to Belfast: A refugee's story,"Mahmood's surname, Halaby, means ""from Aleppo"" in Arabic. 
Having fled 3,000 miles from Syria, it is the only piece of home he carries with him. 
He has not seen his wife or two young sons for 17 months, but this week they are joining him to rebuild their lives in the unfamiliar city of Belfast.
He told me: ""If you stay in Syria, you die or you fight - you don't have a choice.""
Their former city, Aleppo, was once Syria's largest city and the country's economic hub. 
Now it is a crumbling shell of its former self, devastated by half a decade of brutal civil war.
Mahmood's family lived in an area loyal to President Assad, but as the fighting raged on, it became more difficult to get to his carpentry workshop in a rebel-held zone. 
On one of these journeys his 18-year-old nephew, Mohammed, was shot and killed by snipers.
Like many others, the family were forced to stay at home without work for three years, economically crippled as bombs fell around their home.
When asked if he had siblings, Mahmood replied: ""I had five brothers and six sisters but if you have big family, you lost a lot of them.""
He sold off his machinery and fled with his family to Gaziantep in Turkey, where they stayed in the kitchen of his brother-in-law's small flat.  
Mahmood then made the decision to risk his life crossing the Mediterranean to try to establish a life for his family in Europe. 
He paid a smuggler £800 for a place on a plastic boat made for 20 people. 
Fifty-five refugees were eventually crammed on, including women and children - but Mahmood refused to take that risk with his family.
Travelling through Europe, his life was an endless loop of bureaucratic backlogs and walking endlessly with just his phone's GPS for guidance.
On his first attempt to cross into Macedonia from Greece, he and a small group of other refugees walked 30 miles until their feet bled. 
""Nobody helped us, but we have a dream,"" he said. ""We lost all our money,  we are really tired but we continue on our way.""
Like thousands of others, he ended up stranded at Calais. 
He lived in a tent for four-and-a-half months, and said he knew many who lost their lives attempting to cross into the UK. 
Using his carpentry skills, he helped build the mosque and library facilities there - which have now been demolished. 
Eventually a smuggler helped stow him into a van crossing the channel, where he was crammed in for 18 hours without any food.
""You can't go to bathroom, you can't drink water,"" he said. ""But I knew it was my last chance, if I lost it I couldn't try again.""
When asked why he wanted to rebuild his life in the UK, he insisted: ""For me all of Europe is same, but for my children I think here is better.""
Addressing public apprehension regarding incoming refugees and migrants he said: ""In Syria I had everything.
""I had a house, car, a workshop, a farm. We had a very nice life - it's not our dream to come here.
""People think refugees are coming here to take everything free, but I came here because I want to work and make my future.""
""I have the power and skills. I just want to focus on getting a job, because I know it's a long time before the war is finished in Syria.""
Since moving to Belfast in December he has been learning English at college and helping with cooking, gardening and fixing bikes at the centre he has been housed in.
He joked about eating fish and chips in Ballymena when helping load shipping containers of aid for the makeshift camps in Syria and Greece he escaped from.  
Mahmood said that he sometimes struggles with the Belfast accent, as well as with local preconceptions of him as a Syrian refugee. 
""Everyone watches the news and think Syrians are dangerous people. If I liked danger I would stay and fight, not come here.
""I sometimes hear people talking about me, saying 'ISIS' when I talk Arabic.
""I'm Syrian and I'm very proud. I'm not going to change that. It's a problem for them, not for me."" 
He is worried that these comments could affect his children.
""I had a terrible time travelling to find a good future for my boys. If they don't have a problem I am staying. If they do - I'll go to the stars or another planet!""
He is delighted his family's application through the Family Reunification Scheme has been successful.
After 17 months apart and years of living in fear, he hopes they can now begin to build a new life for themselves in Northern Ireland.

http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-45021520,refugee,31 July 2018,None,High Court 'misled' by government over child refugees,"The government ""misled"" the High Court over its decision to refuse unaccompanied child refugees in Calais the right to join their families in the UK, says the Court of Appeal. 
The ruling revealed Home Office lawyers gave advice on how to avoid legal challenges by not giving children reasons for their refusal.
As a result, over 500 children were rejected and ""many"" are now missing.
The Home Office said it had ""noted the criticisms"" and were reviewing them. 
Yvette Cooper MP, chair of the Home Affairs Select Committee, described the Home Office's actions as a ""shocking denial of children's rights"".
The demolition of the ""Jungle"" refugee camp in Calais was ordered in October 2016, when Amber Rudd was Home Secretary. 
As a result of the closure, the government conducted over 1,000 interviews with unaccompanied children who claimed to have family in the UK. 
Around 550 were brought to the country - but over 500 were rejected. 
Many of them then went missing from the French centres they were living in.
The court ruling said the Home Office's process for refusing to transfer the children was ""unfair and unlawful"".
It said failures in the system were prejudicial to the children, who had no realistic prospect of challenging the rejections.
Lord Justice Singh added that not presenting the evidence - namely emails showing the lawyer's advice - to the High Court hearing was ""a serious breach of the duty of candour and co-operation"". 
Charity Safe Passage - part of the community organising group Citizens UK - first took the case to the High Court in September to challenge the Home Office and the way it dealt with the unaccompanied child refugees. 
The court ruled in favour of the government, saying it had acted lawfully in not providing full reasons.
It said, despite ""serious shortcomings"" in the processes of assessing the applications, the department was ""justified"" due to the time frame and urgent conditions the UK was working under after the clearance of the camp was announced.   
But on Tuesday, the Court of Appeal overturned High Court's decision, saying the judge had been given an ""incomplete picture"" by the government and a ""great deal of important evidence"" was not brought to the court's attention. 
The evidence came in the form of emails between the UK Border Force and the French authorities - disclosed in another case being mounted by Citizens UK - detailing the lawyer's advice to not provide reasons for refusal to avoid legal challenges. 
The emails also showed that French officials wanted the children to be given an adequate explanation - despite the government previously presenting evidence that the authorities only required ""sparse"" detail.
Lord Justice Singh said: ""In my judgment, the process which was adopted by the secretary of state in the present context failed to comply with the requirements of procedural fairness as a matter of common law.""
Ms Cooper said : ""Everyone knows the Home Office gets decisions wrong, but these teenagers and children weren't even told the reasons why, so they or their families could challenge basic mistakes.
""The result was many of those teenagers and children disappeared again - very possibly straight back into the arms of smugglers, traffickers and abusers.""
Sonal Ghelani of the Islington Law Centre, which worked on the appeal, said it was ""extremely disturbing"" for the Home Office to act in the way it did. 
Calling for an investigation into the Home Office's actions, she added: ""Public authorities have a duty of candour to provide the court with a full and accurate explanation of all the facts but we now know there was a serious breach of the duty of candour in this case.""
Beth Gardiner-Smith, project lead for Safe Passage, added: ""Tragically, many of the children that were refused by the government with no good reason have since gone missing from French authorities' care, and we have little to no information on their whereabouts or wellbeing.
""Today's judgment reveals not only the failure of the Home Office to comply with law but also its abysmal disregard for the safety and welfare of incredibly vulnerable children.""
A Home Office spokesperson said the UK had worked with France to expedite the transfer of vulnerable unaccompanied children from Calais in October 2016 in response to an ""urgent humanitarian situation"" and their priority was to ""provide safe passage for children"". 
The spokesperson added: ""The court agreed that the process operated by the government was outside of its existing obligations under EU law. 
""However, we note the criticisms contained within the wider ruling and are currently reviewing these with our legal team.""
A French Senate report from July 2017 found that 709 children removed during the clearances of the camps in Calais had subsequently gone missing from French care shelters.

The vote is non-binding on the government, but backers of the scheme called it a ""litmus test"" of parliamentary opinion.

Last month, ministers announced it would close once 350 children had been helped.
In the Commons, MPs debated a cross-party backbench motion calling on the government to continue consulting local authorities over their capacity to take in more child refugees.
It was backed by 254 votes to one, and its supporters said they would put down new amendments to legislation next week to try to force the government to keep the option open.
Former cabinet ministers Maria Miller and Nicky Morgan were among the 20 Tory MPs to support the motion alongside 180 Labour MPs, 42 SNP, six Liberal Democrats, two Plaid Cymru, two independent, one SDLP and Green Party co-leader Caroline Lucas.
Conservative Jacob Rees-Mogg was the sole MP to vote against the motion.

Shaesta Waiz, 29, started her epic flight in a small, single-engine plane from the US where she now lives and recently arrived in Kabul, Afghanistan.
Ms Waiz told reporters she was excited to be back in Afghanistan.
""It's been almost 29 years. To come back to the country as a pilot who is flying around the world to inspire others - it makes me really happy.""
According to the biography on her website, Ms Waiz was born in a refugee camp and travelled to the US in 1987 with her family to escape the Soviet-Afghan war.
She says she grew up in an underprivileged area of Richmond, California, and it wasn't until she discovered aviation that she started thinking about going to college and having a career.
""When I was a little girl I thought maybe I would go to college, but I would get married at a young age and have a family. But then I found something that I really loved and that's flying,"" she told a news conference in Kabul.
""It's an incredible feeling to be the pilot of your own aeroplane and to fly wherever your heart desires. It's a passion that I really enjoy, that I protect, and that I want women from Afghanistan to experience as well.""
She founded a non-profit organisation called Dreams Soar and wants her flight around the world to help inspire girls and young women to pursue science, technology, engineering and maths (STEM) education.
Ms Waiz says she is the first person in her family to earn a bachelor's and a master's degree.
She also says she is the first female certified civilian pilot from Afghanistan and by the end of her challenge aims to be the youngest woman to have flown solo around the world.
Ms Waiz says her message is that you can come ""from any background, you can have any set of challenges but what's really important is that you have to dream, to dream big and work hard and go after it"".
Ms Waiz began her journey in Florida on 13 May and is visiting 19 countries in her Beechcraft Bonanza A36 plane. After leaving Afghanistan she will fly on through Asia and Australia before crossing the US back to Florida.
She says she already has plans to return to Afghanistan.
""In a couple of years I have every intention of coming back here and maybe opening a flight school or doing something so that women can experience aviation in Afghanistan,"" she said.
""Women are suffering here a lot,"" she added. ""I am very fortunate to have had the opportunity to be educated, to find something that I love which is flying and it breaks my heart because I know there are a lot of girls my age who haven't had the opportunities. 
""I want to do something to give back to these women.""

http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/blogs-trending-37793078,refugee,28 October 2016,By BBC Trending,None,"In the Oliver Stone film ""Snowden"", there's a scene where his lawyer takes National Security Agency (NSA) whistleblower Edward Snowden to hide out in a small, unimpressive Hong Kong flat. Inside are a group of refugees. ""These are good people, they won't talk,"" the lawyer tells Snowden. ""They're stateless.""
Now, a GoFundMe fundraising campaign is asking for donations for the four asylum seekers who helped shelter Snowden. 
""As things stand, Edward Snowden is fine,"" reads the campaign page. ""The HK4 (Hong Kong Four) are not...They are not given enough resources to get by, but they are also not allowed to work. If they do work, they face 22 months of prison. It's a Catch 22 from hell.""
Snowden added that the refugees ""have gotten up every morning in the face of tragedy and persecution, and go to sleep each night with whole families in a single bed. And though they have nothing, they risked everything to do what is right. Everything that I thought I knew about bravery was nothing compared to what I saw in Hong Kong.""
Although the campaign creators remain anonymous, the page states that it was set up with the guidance of Snowden's lawyers, Robert Tibbo and Jonathan Man. 
The campaign has been shared more than 1,500 times, including by actor Joseph Gordon-Levitt, who played Snowden in the Stone film.
In an video posted on his Twitter page, Gordon-Levitt said that Snowden hid with refugees ""from Sri Lanka and the Philippines. ...These four people and their families really put themselves at risk in order to help Snowden when he really needed help.""
The actor added that the refugees and their families remain in Hong Kong and ""they're actually living in a really tough situation"". Gordon-Levitt said he would also be donating to cause. The page added that Snowden and journalists Glenn Greenwald and Laura Poitras have already sent the families $20,000.
In 2013, former US government contractor Snowden released tens of thousands of secret documents revealing the extent of government mass surveillance from America's NSA and Britain's GCHQ. After leaving the United States, he met the journalists at the Mira Hotel in Hong Kong.
With the help of his lawyers, Snowden was taken into hiding with the refugees, dubbed ""Snowden's Guardian Angels"", for almost two weeks before arrangements were made to move him to Russia. He remains there under asylum.
Snowden's lawyer Robert Tibbo had done pro bono work in an area he knew Snowden would be safe. He told BBC Trending the reasoning behind the ruse: the area where the refugees lived would be ""the last place that anybody would look"" for him.
""People with the least to give, gave the most,"" Tibbo added.
The GoFundMe page names the refugees as ""four of the most selfless people in the world: Ajith, Nadeeka, Supun and Vanessa.""
""Late at night they knocked on my door... they just told me that they need some help,"" Vanessa, from the Philippines, told CNN. ""I gave him my bed."" 
She added that she recognised her houseguest when she saw a photo of him on the front page of a Chinese newspaper, but wasn't tempted to compromise his safety.
Hong Kong authorities do provide money for rent, some utilities and food coupons to refugees. However, they are not permitted to work and are denied citizenship - even children of refugees born in the country are denied passports and are essentially stateless.
BBC Trending has also approached the Hong Kong Security Bureau for comment.

http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-45011911,refugee,31 July 2018,None,Refugees' housing in Belfast 'below basic standards',"Some Syrian refugees in west Belfast are living in conditions that fall well below basic standards, according to a human rights group.
A report by the Participation and Practice of Human Rights Project states that some of the properties have water leaks, damp and rodent infestations.
The accommodation has been provided by a private company which is contracted by the Housing Executive.
The Housing Executive said it will make sure that repairs are carried out.
The report - entitled We Came Here For Sanctuary - focuses on six families who have complained about the conditions which they have had to live in since they settled in Belfast through a United Nations scheme.
The housing assessed by the group was said to be ""well below both domestic and international standards"".
The families have been living in temporary accommodation while permanent housing is found for them.
They claim the poor housing has caused them physical and mental health problems.
Some of the issues the families said they have faced include gas leaks, broken floors and in one case a fireplace coming off a living room wall.
The report concludes their concerns have been ""all too frequently ignored or even treated, as they see it, with disdain"".
The issues have also been ""raised repeatedly"" by support agencies on behalf of the families but ""seem to fall on deaf ears"", the report claimed.
One father, Abdelkader, told the BBC that the house his family is living in was not good for his children's health.
""I have two children - babies - and I face a house full of damp,"" he said through an interpreter.
""The medical condition of my baby doesn't allow us even to exist in a house like that since the house is full with mould - we reported this stuff.
""All I want is to find a house suitable for our kids.""
Another man, Ahmed, said water leaks have caused problems for his family and worms and slugs could be found in the kitchen.
The Participation and Practice of Human Rights Project said all six of the families were living in homes managed by Homecare Housing.
The company said it was not shown the critical report before it was published.
Elfie Seymour from the Participation and Practice of Human Rights Project said the Housing Executive was ""failing"" the refugees.
""A lot of public money is going in to housing these families and the UN resettlement scheme, which all these families came through, was supported widely by the general public,"" she said.
""We all had expectations about how these families would be welcomed and supported.
""But the agencies that were forced with doing this task are failing to meet those expectations.""
The majority of the 248 families of Syrian refugees - 1,010 people - who have settled in Northern Ireland since December 2015 have had ""no issues"" with their accommodation, a Housing Executive spokesman said.
""All temporary accommodation is carefully sourced and inspected by the Housing Executive before any placement is made,"" he added.
""Following the placement periodic inspections are carried out - if there is any disrepair this is reported in the first instance to the private landlord.
""We are aware these issues have been reported to the landlord and we are sure they will be addressed.""
The families said they have no issues with their medical care and the schooling of their children.
But some have said they have been subjected to racist harassment.
The report states that ""rubbish, eggs and stones have been thrown at their homes"" and children have been ""beaten on their way to the shops or when playing outside"".
One mother, Kamar, said she faces ""a lot of racism where I live"".

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-45640307,refugee,18 October 2018,By James Badcock,Venezuelans escape to Spain and ask to return old favour,"Once, Spaniards fleeing repression and poverty in Francisco Franco's dictatorship found themselves building new lives in Venezuela, given refuge by their cousins across the Atlantic. 
Now, Venezuelans are asking them to return the favour.
A shared language and cultural heritage draw Venezuelans escaping from hardship under the socialist government of President Nicolás Maduro.
But many new arrivals say Spain's authorities are failing to recognise them as genuine refugees, forcing them into legal limbo and black economy jobs.  
Venezuelans have topped the list of asylum requests in Spain for three years, but only a tiny fraction are granted refugee status: just 15 out of 12,875 last year.
The UN says that 208,333 Venezuelans were living in Spain by April this year - but August figures from Spain's labour ministry show that fewer than 40,000 are officially registered to work.
Many of the rest disappear into the black economy.
Most Venezuelans arriving at Spanish airports claim to be tourists. In reality many have sold everything just to get there.
""Venezuela received Spaniards with no questions asked, regardless of whether they had money or papers. The least we expect is to be received in the same way,"" says Luis Manresa, a Venezuelan politician from the opposition party Acción Democrática. 
He fled to Madrid in 2011 because, he says, he had received threats from the government and was about to be arrested on trumped-up charges. 
But he says: ""Venezuelans don't come here to beg; they come to work.""
Volunteers in Mr Manresa's support network say 200 to 300 families arrive in Spain every week, some of whom end up being held at the airport because they lack papers - or cannot convince the police that they are planning only to visit.  
Maria Eugenia Carrillo was enthusiastic about the system of free schooling introduced by Hugo Chávez in the early 2000s. But increasing pressure by her bosses to include political content in lessons bothered her. And then there was the poverty.
""I saw my children sick and hungry, their parents looking for food among the rubbish and diseases like measles running rampant through the school,"" she says.
""When parents came to pick up their children they stopped asking 'what did you learn today?' and asked instead: 'What did you eat today?'""
The 52-year-old teacher says that the political pressure caused her so much stress that her fibromyalgia became more acute - until she decided she had to leave Venezuela, flying to Madrid in October 2017.
Without official papers, she has no chance of working as a teacher, and is cleaning homes for cash.
""I always dreamed of living and dying in Venezuela,"" she says. ""I even had a beach house until a Chavista [a supporter of Venezuela's government] took a shine to it and moved in. I couldn't do anything. I was paralysed by the fear of being arrested.""
William Cárdenas, a lawyer and former Venezuelan diplomat now in Madrid, says Spain's government could use an existing law designed for cases of a massive influx of displaced people from a foreign country. 
But Spain says Venezuelans cannot be considered ""displaced"" in the same way as refugees fleeing a war zone.
Venezuela's government, meanwhile, claims that the exodus of citizens is the result of a propaganda campaign aimed at bringing down the socialist regime. 
""Some of the Venezuelans who left to clean toilets abroad have become economic slaves because they were told it was necessary to leave the country,"" President Maduro said in August.   
The irony of Spain and Venezuela's reversal in fortunes is not lost on Cándido Soengas, who escaped poverty and dictatorship in 1950s Spain by crossing the Atlantic.
Now, he has been forced to return to Spain, as living conditions unravelled in the Venezuelan capital.
""I never expected to come back,"" 87-year-old Mr Soengas says in the garden of his Madrid retirement home, reminiscing on the life he and his late wife made for themselves in Caracas.
""I was happy in Venezuela. There were always people about to lend me a hand and when I brought my children up, we wanted for nothing.""
""They were good times.""
Mr Soengas took a ship to Venezuela in 1956 because he was fed up with the poverty and lack of job prospects in Galicia, in Spain's north-west. He married a fellow Galician immigrant and had a string of small business ventures in Caracas. 
As a retired widower, Mr Soengas's health began to deteriorate, and he could no longer get the medicine he needed to control his epilepsy. 
""Caracas became like Galicia under Franco when I was a boy, when there was rationing. I would be queuing outside a food store, and then the door closed because there was nothing left.""
A year after his return, he was joined in Madrid by his grandson, Jesús Soengas, who says he feared for his life after participating in student protests against the Maduro government.
""When I saw how my friends, the people that studied with me, started getting killed by the government, I decided I might be next,"" he says. 
He is fortunate enough to hold a Spanish passport.
Jesús is combining law studies at a Madrid university with shifts as a Deliveroo bicycle courier. ""Sometimes, I hardly sleep because of studies and work. But I am lucky to have the possibility of working legally.""
While leaving Venezuela was emotionally very hard, his hope is that the experience of exile will one day enable him to return to help rebuild it.
""If I want to build that better country, I have to prepare myself, to study, to see different things and see how democracy works in the real world.""

http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-38921942,refugee,9 February 2017,None,Far-right German politician convicted for refugee shelter arson,"A far-right German politician has been sentenced to eight years in prison for burning down a sports hall that was to be used to accommodate refugees.
Maik Schneider, a local National Democratic Party (NPD) politician, was convicted of arson by a Potsdam court.
He was given an additional 18-month prison term for other offences.
The hall in Nauen, just west of Berlin, was burnt down in August 2015 as large numbers of asylum seekers arrived in Germany.
No one was injured in the blaze but the hall was completely destroyed, with the cost of the damage estimated at €3.5m (£3m).
An accomplice, who was not identified by the DPA news agency, was given a seven-year term, while four others were given suspended sentences of varying lengths.
During the trial, 29-year-old Schneider had claimed that he was trying to send a political message but had not meant to burn down the building.
He also denied that he had acted out of xenophobic motives.
Many Germans consider the NPD, which has 5,000 members, to be a neo-Nazi group.
Judge Theodor Horstkotter said Schneider and his accomplices had clearly acted on right-wing extremist beliefs.
""The attack was meant to signal to refugees: you are not welcome here, we don't have space for you, you aren't safe here,"" he said.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel's office describes the NPD as an ""anti-democratic, xenophobic, anti-Semitic, anti-constitutional party"".
The six men prosecuted are reported to have previously committed other crimes, including setting fire to the car of a Polish citizen.
Last month Germany's Federal Constitutional Court rejected a historic attempt to ban the NPD. The case was brought by the state governments represented in the upper house of parliament, the Bundesrat.
The court ruled that the party did not have the potential to overthrow democracy in Germany.

http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-38959441,refugee,13 February 2017,None,Justin Trudeau: I won't lecture Trump over refugee ban,"Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has said he will not lecture President Donald Trump on Syrian refugees.
""The last thing Canadians expect is for me to come down and lecture another country on how they choose to govern,"" he said at the White House.
Both leaders stressed the countries' shared economic goals and co-operation at a joint news conference. 
But their responses to questions about Syrian refugees underscored their contrasting policies on immigration. 
Mr Trump defended his controversial travel ban, saying he wanted ""to have a big beautiful, open door"", but that ""we cannot let the wrong people in"".
The US president has stirred controversy for issuing an executive order temporarily banning entry of all refugees and visitors from seven mainly Muslim countries. 
A federal judge has issued a temporary nationwide block on the travel ban, but the issue of refugees appeared to overshadow the joint news conference. 
Mr Trudeau said the US and Canada had always been strong allies, fighting alongside one another on various battlefields.
""But there are times when we have differed in our approaches. And that's always been done firmly and respectfully,"" he said.
Justin Trudeau had a fine line to walk on Monday and came through with his best diplomatic balancing act. 
The prime minister can travel back to Ottawa with Mr Trump on the record as having called the trade relationship between the two nations ""outstanding"" and only in need of a ""tweaking"". 
What those tweaks might entail is still to be revealed, but you could almost hear anxious Canadian businesspeople breathing a sigh of relief. 
This first face-to-face meeting also offered a clue at how far Mr Trudeau was willing to go preserve those vital trade ties.
Mr Trudeau refused to bite when the press repeatedly baited him to criticise his host on thorny issues like immigration, though many of his own policies stand as a reproach to those of the new US president.

The prime minister added that Canada continues to ""pursue our policies of openness"" without compromising security and would serve as a ""positive example in the world"".
The Canadian leader made global headlines for accepting nearly 40,000 refugees, and has said his country will welcome those fleeing persecution and war.
US refugee ban: Canada's Justin Trudeau takes a stand
When Mr Trump signed the controversial order, Mr Trudeau tweeted his government's commitment to bringing in ""those fleeing persecution, terror & war"".
He also sent a pointed tweet that showed him greeting a young refugee at a Canadian airport in 2015.
""This is a delicate situation here I don't think it would help anyone in this country if the prime minister went to the US and started a fight,"" said Opposition Conservative leader Rona Ambrose.
The two men, however, emphasised their commitment to provide growth and jobs for people on both sides of the northern border. 
""We will co-ordinate closely to protect jobs in our hemisphere and to keep wealth in our continent,"" said Mr Trump.
Mr Trudeau gave Mr Trump a framed photograph of the US president and the prime minister's father, Pierre Trudeau. 
The picture was taken in 1981 when the then-Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau received an award in New York City, according to the prime minister's office. 
The US president's pledge to renegotiate free trade deal Nafta has reportedly unsettled Canadian officials - 75% of the country's exports go to the US.
The two leaders, and Mr Trump's daughter Ivanka, also led a roundtable discussion on female workers.
The neighbouring countries launched a new task force called the United States Canada Council for the Advancement of Women Business Leaders-Female Entrepreneurs. 
Ivanka Trump, who appealed to working women throughout her father's presidential campaign, helped secure female executives to participate and set the agenda for the meeting.
The joint task force may help allay tensions over some of the protectionist measures Mr Trump has issued since he took office in January. 
It was a cold that Seidu Mohammed and Razak Iyal could barely comprehend. 
On Christmas Eve, they found themselves struggling through a waist-deep field of snow in a rash night-time bid to sneak across the Canada-US border. 
The two men had met a just few hours before at a Minneapolis bus station and both faced deportation back to Ghana after being denied refugee status in the US. 
They had heard through a network of other refugees and African expats that if they could get into Canada, they had a second shot at asylum in the north. 
By the time they reached Highway 75 in Manitoba, their hands had frozen into claws. They could not reach the phones in their pockets to dial 9-1-1 as planned. Mohammed's eyes had frozen shut.

http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-38960035,refugee,13 February 2017,By Jessica Murphy,Crossing the border: US migrants seek refugee status in Canada,"Asylum seekers are illegally crossing from the US into Canada in growing numbers hoping to receive refugee status. One small prairie town in southern Manitoba has become the nexus point for migrants who have lost hope in the US. 
It was a cold Seidu Mohammed and Razak Iyal could barely comprehend. 
On Christmas Eve, they found themselves struggling through a waist-deep field of snow in a rash night-time bid to sneak across the Canada-US border. 
The two men had met just few hours before at a Minneapolis bus station and both faced deportation back to Ghana after being denied refugee status in the US. 
They had heard through a network of other refugees and African expats that if they could get into Canada, they had a second shot at asylum in the north. 
The path was straightforward: find a ride to the border from Minneapolis, MN  or Grand Forks, ND, avoid patrols until you reach Canadian soil, and then turn yourself into Canadian authorities as an asylum seeker. 
Iyal and Mohammed decided to make the trek together, and paid US$200 each to a cab driver who dropped them near the international boundary. 
They kept to the road until they neared the border. 
""That's where we saw the big farm with the snow. Snow everywhere. We were seeing the light of the border far from us, but we are seeing the light,"" Iyal recalls. 
Soon they had lost their gloves in the snow. The wind stole Mohammed's baseball cap. 
""There is wind and cold,"" he says ""And the wind is blowing the snow into our face. So I can't see nothing."" 
By the time they reached Highway 75 in Manitoba, their hands had frozen into claws. They could not reach the phones in their pockets to dial 9-1-1 as planned. Mohammed's eyes had frozen shut. 
The only vehicles on the road before dawn on Christmas were transport trucks ferrying cargo between the US and Canada. Many passed, flashing their high beams at the two before blowing by, until one stopped to give them assistance.
They have been receiving treatment at a specialised burn unit in a Winnipeg hospital since that 10-hour journey. Both had most of their fingers amputated due to the severe frostbite. 
Iyal says nurses had to chip away at the snow and ice between Mohammed's fingers.  
Their story has brought attention to a phenomenon that is not new but has been growing steadily in recent years. And it has not deterred others from making the cross-border trip. Record numbers of people have crossed near Emerson in the past few weeks. 
It is not just Manitoba. Quebec and British Columbia are also seeing more and more people illegally crossing the border to make refugee claims. 
In the prairie province, the influx is centred on Emerson, a municipality of about 700 people that borders Minnesota. 
The rural town, surrounded by farm fields, is about 625km (390 miles) up the Interstate from Minneapolis, which has the largest Somali population in North America.  Word about the Emerson crossing has spread within the expat community, as far as down to Brazil. 
""We've always had people jumping the borders, for, I don't know, 30, 40, 50 years. Back then, it was people running away from something - usually the law,"" says town official Greg Janzen. 
But in recent years it has been mostly asylum seekers, hailing mainly from Somalia but also Ghana, Djibouti, and Ethiopia, who are finding their way across. Community workers say most have been denied refugee status in the US.
Many have been met with generosity. 
Yahya Samatar, a former human rights worker in Somalia, fled threats from Islamist al-Shabab militants and sought refugee status in the US, where he spent seven months in an immigration detention centre. 
The US denied his status but said it was too dangerous to deport him back to war-torn Somalia, and released him with a warning that he could be sent back anytime.
Like Iyal and Mohammed, he heard about the backdoor into Canada, and found himself in August 2015 on the banks of the Red River, which runs through Manitoba and between North Dakota and Minnesota. 
He stripped to his underwear and swam across. Shivering and covered in mud, he then walked into Emerson, where a resident gave him a sweater and called border services. 
""I was given clothes, I was given food, everything"" by border agents, says Samatar, who has since received refugee status and lives in Winnipeg. 
But now in Emerson, a wariness is emerging. 
The municipality that has opened its doors to those seeking refuge is wondering how far town resources will be stretched and what happens if someone who comes across poses a danger. 
There are also concerns that someone will die trying to make the trek across frozen fields in temperatures that can easily fall to -20C (-4F). Many also expect the number of attempts to cross will increase with warmer weather. 
For now, they do not see what other option there is except to do what they can to help. 
""If we don't they'll freeze and starve, and it would be on our conscience wouldn't it?"" says resident Walter Kihn, who lives on the eastern edge of Emerson.
Mr Janzen says ""most people in town are more concerned than scared"" about the strangers wandering into town. 
In the last three weeks, almost 60 people made the trek, including 21 who crossed in the hours before dawn on Saturday morning. 
A group of 16 people, including women and children, rang doorbells in town seeking help. 
""They went to the neighbours and got everybody riled up there,"" said resident Ernie Neufeld. One house took in the women and children, while ""the RCMP tried to decide what to do with"" the men.  
The Manitoba-US border runs 500km (310 miles) along Minnesota and North Dakota. 
Authorities from the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA), which oversees the official border points, and the Mounties, which polices the rest, say they are confident in the border's integrity. 
And they say those coming are quickly spotted or turn themselves so they can submit refugee claims. 
Once apprehended, they are identified, searched and screened. If they are eligible to make an asylum claim, they are allowed entry and referred to the  Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada. 
Settlement workers assisting with the newest claims are pointing to the political rhetoric south of the border for the recent spike. 
Rita Chahal, executive director of the Manitoba Interfaith Immigration Council, has opened over 300 files since April 2016 for refugee claimants crossing near Emerson.   
""Anecdotally, many people do express that they are concerned about what they saw at the airports, what they are seeing in the US,"" she says.  
In fact, in a November speech in Minnesota, then-presidential candidate Donald Trump singled out the state's Somali community. 
""Here in Minnesota, you've seen first hand the problems caused with faulty refugee-vetting, with very large numbers of Somali refugees coming into your state without your knowledge, your support or approval,"" he said. 
Mohammed says he once viewed the US as a beacon for human rights and a place that welcomed newcomers but  ""when we came, we didn't see that"". 
He and Iyal have hearings in March to determine whether they can stay in Canada.
Their lawyer has told them not to divulge too many details about the specifics of their refugee claims but Iyal says he left Ghana for personal and political reasons.
Mohammed left because of his sexuality - being gay is illegal in the African country. 
They say in the meantime they will continue to heal from their injuries and learn how to live with their disability. 
 ""We just wait, impatiently, for what is coming next,"" Iyal says.

http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/blogs-trending-40518835,refugee,6 July 2017,By Rozina Sini,None,"A woman in Lebanon has been photographed digging up her son's grave to provide burial space for a Syrian boy killed in a fire at a refugee camp.
The pictures of the woman were posted on Facebook on 3 July and have been widely shared on social media. Lebanese news sites and the Facebook page of Refugees Without Borders claim the images to be genuine, although the BBC could not independently verify this.
Refugees Without Borders shared the images with the post: ""Lebanese woman opens the grave of her son , who died a year ago and buried a Syrian boy who died yesterday due to the fire that broke out at a refugee camp in the Bekaa Valley, after all villages refused to bury him in their tombs.""
You might also like:
There are more than 1.5 million Syrian refugees in Lebanon, many of whom, displaced by more than six years of fighting in their own country, live in makeshift camps dotted around Lebanon.
Although it is not clear why the local graveyards refused to bury the boy, who local news reports said was two years old, cemeteries are typically reserved for Lebanese nationals. Many municipalities in the country have also issued restrictions preventing the burial of Syrian refugees in their often overcrowded cemeteries.
Many Syrians shared the images, praising the Lebanese woman at a time when feelings of anger at the Lebanese army and security forces are growing.
But there was also outrage at the treatment of Syrian refugees.
""Has it really come to this, they even refuse the dead? Are they human?"" One Facebook user asked underneath the shared photographs. 
Another Facebook user posted: ""For 20 years during the [Lebanese civil] war, Syria hosted Lebanese, and today no father can bury his child here."" 
A separate post condemned the treatment of Syrian refugees as racism: ""This woman deserves all the respect and appreciation. Shame on those who refused to bury the child. This is the dark side of racism in Lebanon against Syrian refugees."" 
A series of suicide attacks in the northeastern Lebanese border village of Al Qaa in June 2016 triggered a spike in anti-Syrian sentiment. Since the blasts the Lebanese authorities have imposed curfews on Syrian refugees in some areas and raided refugee camps, citing security concerns.
Part of the hostility stems from the resentment of refugees' perceived preferential treatment by non-government organisations in the distribution of aid and access to public services.
The Syrian opposition has strongly condemned what it called attacks by the Lebanese armed forces on Syrian refugees camps. An attack in Arsal in Lebanon took place last week and resulted in the death of a number of refugees and the detention of hundreds more.

The UK government has come under fire for ending the ""Dubs amendment"" scheme in March after taking in 350 children.
Ms Sturgeon said the scheme was ""the only reliable and legal route"" for unaccompanied child refugees.
Home Secretary Amber Rudd said the scheme ""acts as a pull"" factor and ""encourages people traffickers"".
The Home Office has insisted it is not giving up on vulnerable children and said youngsters would continue to arrive from around the world through other resettlement schemes and the asylum system.
There are an estimated 90,000 unaccompanied migrant children across Europe.
The scheme in question was set up as part of an amendment attached to the Immigration Act 2016 by Labour peer and former child refugee Lord Dubs. The government had come under pressure from campaigners and members of the public to take in children from the ""Jungle"" migrant camp in Calais.
The legislation required the Home Office to allow ""a specified number"" of vulnerable unaccompanied children into the UK. 
Lord Dubs and his supporters suggested this number could be as high as 3,000, but the government said the 350 children eventually accepted satisfied the ""intention and spirit"" of the amendment.
In a letter to the prime minister, Ms Sturgeon said she found it ""hard to understand why the UK government would even consider the inhumane withdrawal of essential routes to safety"" for vulnerable children.
She said: ""The plight of all unaccompanied children demands a resolute and humanitarian approach from all parts of the UK, and other countries, and this departure from the Dubs amendment cuts off a vital route to safety.""
The first minister said her government supported a number of other UK commitments to taking in refugees, such as the Syrian Resettlement Programme, and said Scotland ""stands ready"" to help ""provide a place of safety to children in the gravest of situations"".
She added: ""I urge you to reverse the shameful decision on the Dubs amendment which cuts off the only reliable and legal route for unaccompanied children arriving from Europe.
""We all have a moral duty to do what we can to help those most in need, so I look forward to your earliest response.""
The UK government announced it would stop taking in children via the Dubs amendment at the end of March in a written statement at Westminster. 
Immigration minister Robert Goodwill said 200 children had already arrived, and said 150 more would follow before the end of March, filling the available places offered by local authorities.
He said that more than 900 children had been brought to the UK from Calais in total in 2016.
Speaking in the House of Commons, Ms Rudd said the government had a ""clear strategy"" and believed it was taking ""the right approach"".
She said: ""Here in the UK we have launched the national transfer scheme, and we've also significantly increased funding for local authorities caring for unaccompanied asylum-seeking children by between 20 and 28%.
""The government has taken significant steps to improve an already comprehensive approach, and we are providing protection to thousands of children this year. I am proud of this government's active approach to helping and sheltering the most vulnerable, and that is a position which will continue.""
Addressing the Dubs scheme directly, she added: ""I am clear that when working with my French counterparts they do not want us to indefinitely continue to accept children under the Dubs amendment because they specify, and I agree with them, that it acts as a draw.
""It acts as a pull. It encourages the people traffickers.""
Campaigners have sought to challenge the decision in court, saying the consultation process by which Ms Rudd decided on the figure of 350 was ""fundamentally flawed"".
At a preliminary hearing at the High Court in London on Friday, judges said they were ""determined"" to move the case forward quickly, setting a provision date for a full hearing in May.

http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-38917681,refugee,9 February 2017,None,Kenyan closure of Dadaab refugee camp blocked by high court,"The High Court in Kenya has blocked the government's bid to close the largest refugee camp in the world.
A directive to shut the Dadaab camp and forcibly repatriate about 260,000 Somali refugees living there was issued last year.
The deadline for its closure had been extended until May, but a high court judge ruled the decision was tantamount to an act of group persecution.
The government says it will appeal against the ruling on security grounds.
It said that attacks on its soil by the Somalia-based al-Shabab group had been planned in the camp.
""The camp had lost its humanitarian nature and had become a haven for terrorism and other illegal activities,"" Kenyan government spokesman Eric Kiraithe said.
""The lives of Kenyans matter. Our interest in this case, and in the closure of Dadaab refugee camp, remains to protect the lives of Kenyans,"" he added.
Dadaab was set up in 1991 to house families fleeing conflict in Somalia, and some people have been living there for more than 20 years.
The Kenya National Commission on Human Rights and lobby group Kituo Cha Sheria challenged the decision in court, saying it was discriminatory and contrary to international law. 
""The government's decision specifically targeting Somali refugees is an act of group persecution, illegal discriminatory and therefore unconstitutional,"" Judge John Mativo said.
The orders are excessive, arbitrary and disproportionate, he said.
The BBC's Nancy Kacungira in the capital, Nairobi, says the ruling means the government has to start putting in place mechanisms that will restore regular operations at the camp even though it will launch an appeal.
Kenya's refugee department had already been shut, which meant that new-born babies were not being registered as refugees, Said Abuka, a community leader and refugee in Nairobi, told the Associated Press news agency.
Amnesty International welcomed the ruling, saying it affirmed Kenya's legal obligation to protect people who seek safety from harm and persecution.
""Today is a historic day for more than a quarter of a million refugees who were at risk of being forcefully returned to Somalia, where they would have been at serious risk of human rights abuses,"" the rights group's Muthoni Wanyeki said in a statement.
Mr Kiraithe said since the closure of Dadaab was announced, more than 51,000 Somalis had voluntarily returned to Somalia.
""We are encouraged that Somalia continues to stabilise politically more so with the election of a new president,"" he added.
Somalia's 'Mr Cheese' president has a lot on his plate
Somalia's UN-backed government, with the help of a 22,000-strong African Union force, is battling Islamist group al-Shabab to regain control of the country.
But it has only managed to secure major towns.
The militants, who impose a strict version of Islam in the areas they control, still mount deadly bombings and have carried out a string of attacks in neighbouring Kenya. 
Kenya is currently building a fence along its 700km (435-mile) border with Somalia, but has completed only 4km so far.

http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-38851941,refugee,3 February 2017,None,Fiji deports Iranian refugee who fled Papua New Guinea,"Fiji has deported an Iranian refugee back to Papua New Guinea, where he spent years detained under Australia's controversial immigration policies. 
Loghman Sawari used fake documents to fly to Fiji to seek asylum, saying he did not feel safe in PNG.
But on Friday the 21-year-old was stopped by police as he went to meet immigration officials and deported.
Rights groups have condemned the move. Amnesty International said it had ""grave concerns"" about his wellbeing. 
Loghman Sawari arrived in PNG in 2013. He was one of about 1,250 asylum seekers detained by Australia in two offshore camps, in PNG's Manus Island and on the Pacific island of Nauru. 
Australia refuses to accept refugees who arrive by boat, and says they must resettle in Cambodia or PNG. Rights groups say the policy contradicts international obligations and that conditions in the camps are deplorable.  
Mr Sawari was recognised as a refugee and released from the Manus Island camp into the community. But there have been many reports of tensions and violence between refugees and PNG residents.
In September 2015 he told Britain's Guardian newspaper he had been assaulted by a guard at the transit centre because he asked for more washing powder, and required hospital treatment. 
He was later resettled in the city of Lae, but lost his job and became homeless.
In February 2016 he told the Sydney Morning Herald newspaper that he wanted to return to the detention centre because life in Lae left him scared, lonely and poor.  
""I was never, not for one day, safe in PNG,"" he told the Guardian earlier this week.
He arrived in Fiji last week. His lawyer, Aman Ravindra Singh, told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation that a meeting had been arranged on Friday for his asylum application to be lodged. 
But he said police stopped their vehicle as they drove there, shouted at Mr Sawari to get out and bundled him into a car bound for the airport. He said he hadn't been able to speak to him since.
""I am not aware of what grounds the Fijian government used to unleash their thuggish ways against this young, desperate victim of persecution,"" he said.  
""The Fijian government has miserably failed in using its own domestic laws to deal with this situation.""
Fiji says he was deported because he had not applied for asylum straight away and because he had entered on a false passport. 
Describing his case as ""extreme"", rights group Amnesty said: ""The Australian government forced him into this position, they've pushed him to his limits and now they must take responsibility to provide him with the protection he needs.""
Australia had agreed a deal with the Obama administration under which refugees detained in its offshore camps could apply to be resettled in the US. 
But the deal appears to be in doubt, after new US President Donald Trump described it as ""dumb"" and reportedly cut short a call with the Australian prime minister. 
"
http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-australia-38837263,refugee,2 February 2017,None,US-Australia refugee deal: Trump in 'worst call' with Turnbull,"A phone call between US President Donald Trump and Australian PM Malcolm Turnbull has called into question a refugee resettlement deal.
The Washington Post reported Mr Trump called the conversation ""the worst by far"" of his calls with world leaders that day, and cut it short.
Mr Trump later tweeted that he would ""study this dumb deal"". 
Struck with the Obama administration, it would see up to 1,250 asylum seekers to Australia resettled in the US.
Australia has controversially refused to accept the refugees - most of whom are men from Iran, Afghanistan and Iraq - and instead holds them in offshore detention centres on the Pacific nations of Nauru and Papua New Guinea.
The world is getting its first look at Donald Trump the Diplomat. He looks a lot like Donald Trump the Candidate, Donald Trump the Businessman and Donald Trump the Reality Television Host.
He's brash. He has a temper. He's willing to say impolite things. He can be bullying or ingratiating, depending on his own internal calculations. 
Such attributes made him must-see television on The Apprentice. It helped him land blockbuster real-estate deals in boom times and stay one step ahead of financial collapse when business went bad. 
It's an open question whether it will be effective as a way to assert national authority on the world stage. 
Read Anthony's take
Prime Minister Turnbull had been seeking clarification on the future of the deal after Mr Trump last Friday signed an executive order temporarily barring the entry into the US of refugees and people from seven Muslim-majority countries.
Later on Thursday, Mr Trump seemed to brush off the reports, saying it was only right that he would need to have tough conversations with other world leaders. 
""The world is in trouble but we're gonna straighten it out... That's what I do, I fix things,"" he said, speaking at the National Prayer Breakfast meeting in Washington DC. 
The phone call between Mr Trump and Mr Turnbull took place on Saturday, and was one of four the US president had with world leaders, including Russia's Vladimir Putin.
The Washington Post quotes senior US officials, briefed on the call, as saying that the conversation should have lasted an hour but was abruptly ended after 25 minutes by Mr Trump.
Mr Turnbull was seeking assurances from Mr Trump that the deal would be honoured.
The US president reportedly said accepting the refugees would be like the US accepting ""the next Boston bombers"", who were from the Caucasus region of Russia.
The official version of the call from the US was brief, but said both leaders had ""emphasised the enduring strength and closeness of the US-Australia relationship"".
On Monday Mr Turnbull confirmed he had spoken to Mr Trump and thanked him for agreeing to uphold the deal.
US presidential spokesman Sean Spicer has since also said Mr Trump intends to uphold the deal.
But Mr Trump's tweet on Wednesday - coming after the Washington Post story - has thrown fresh doubt on the arrangement.
Mr Turnbull later said he was disappointed that details of the call - which he described as ""very frank and forthright"" - had been made public. 
He told a Sydney radio station that ""the report that the president hung up is not correct"".
Australia announced in November 2016 that the US had agreed to a one-off deal to resettle refugees currently being held on Nauru and Manus Island, in Papua New Guinea (PNG). 
In return, Mr Turnbull's administration agreed to resettle refugees from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador.
The UN refugee agency, UNHCR, would oversee the deal and the ""most vulnerable"" would be prioritised, the Australian premier said. 
No numbers were given and Australian Immigration Department Secretary Mike Pezzullo later told a Senate inquiry that, while those who were eligible could express an interest, it was up to the US to decide how many people it wanted to take. 
A total of 1,254 people were being held in the two camps, 871 on Manus Island and 383 in Nauru, as of 30 November 2016, according to Australian government statistics.
Mr Trump's tweet incorrectly labelled refugees as illegal, and recast the number who might be resettled as ""thousands"".
Australia refuses to accept refugees who arrive by boat, under a tough deterrent policy. It has already struck resettlement deals with Cambodia and PNG, but only a handful of refugees have been resettled. Critics say the two nations are completely ill-equipped to resettle refugees. 
So the US deal was a boon to the Australian government from a close political and military ally. 
Australia has faced fierce international criticism for its offshore detention policy and wants to close the Manus Island camp. Conditions in the offshore camps have been roundly condemned by rights groups, who say the policy is punitive and inflicts harm on refugees. 
Official figures show that about 80% of those held on Manus Island and Nauru have been found to be genuine refugees (those found not to be are not eligible for the US deal). 
All of the occupants of Manus Island are male. By far the largest number are from Iran, followed by Afghanistan and Iraq. There are also sizeable contingents from Bangladesh, Pakistan and Myanmar. 
The Nauru camp holds men, women and children. Again the largest number come from Iran, followed by Sri Lanka and those who are stateless. 
Some of those being held have spent several years in the camps awaiting a decision on their fate.

http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-38892387,refugee,7 February 2017,None,Facebook in court over refugee selfie fake news stories,"Syrian refugee Anas Modamani is suing Facebook after a selfie he took with Chancellor Angela Merkel was used in fake news stories.
A court in Wurzburg, Germany, heard opening remarks from lawyers representing both sides.
Mr Modamani's photo went viral in August 2015 but was later used to falsely link him to terror attacks.
Facebook deleted some of the posts, but lawyers for Mr Modamani claimed that it had still appeared widely.
They argued that Facebook could have done more to prevent people from sharing the selfie.
The image has been used in posts about attacks in Brussels and on a Christmas market in Berlin. 
Facebook lawyer Martin Munz countered that, with billions of postings each day, the company would need to employ ""a sort of wonder machine"" to detect each misuse, according to Bloomberg.
It also argued that it had removed all images reported by Mr Modamani and that, as the case involved defamation, it was the individuals who had posted the images not Facebook that should be held responsible.
Mr Modamani fled Syria in 2015 and was living in a Berlin shelter, which Ms Merkel visited.
He shared the selfie on his Facebook page, and it became an emblem of Ms Merkel's immigration policy.
Facebook has faced mounting criticism over its handling of fake news stories, and has recently launched filtering systems in the US, Germany and France.
It comes amid suggestions that fake news reports influenced the outcome of the US presidential election.
In France, Facebook has joined forces with Google and eight news organisations to launch fact-checking tools to root out fake news ahead of the country's presidential election.
Germany, which also has elections this year, is considering fining the social media giant for every fake news article it fails to remove.
A ruling on this case is expected in March.

http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-38795032,refugee,7 February 2017,By Julian Fowler,Cuban refugee boat washes up on County Sligo beach,"On a sandy beach on the west coast of Ireland lies the remains of a strange looking boat.
The improvised vessel washed up on Cliffoney beach in County Sligo.
It is made from a metal frame partly covered in yellow tarpaulin, with expanded foam and water bottles used for buoyancy.
A closer inspection beneath the overturned hull, now covered in barnacles, reveals a car engine connected to a broken propeller.
The boat caught the interest of Gordon Fallis, who saw it as he was walking his dogs along the beach.
""I didn't really know what it was to be honest, so I took a few photographs of it and when I got home I posted it on a Facebook page called Lost at Sea which tracks marine debris and cargo spills and things that get washed up on beaches,"" he said.
He was contacted by a man from Florida who recognised the design as being similar to Cuban refugee boats.
""He advised me to have a look at the bottles again to see where they came from so I came back down and looked at the labels and indeed they were from Cuba, exactly the same brand that he had predicted, so it seems that it is actually a boat that the refugees have used to try and get to America from Cuba,"" he said.
Since 1995, under a policy known as ""wet foot, dry foot"", if Cubans are picked up at sea they are returned home or taken to a third country, but if they make it to American soil they get the opportunity to stay and become legal residents.
Between November 2015 and October 2016 the US Coast Guard apprehended 5,263 Cubans at sea.
It is thought that hundreds of thousands of Cubans attempted the journey before the policy was ended last month just before President Obama left office. 
American photographer Bill Klipp has seen many similar boats that have been abandoned on small remote islands around the Florida Keys.
He is sure the boat washed up in Ireland is what is known as a Cuban ""chug"" - named after the sound of the crude motors as they make the slow journey across the sea.  
""They're surely not moving very fast and I think it just comes from that notion that they're just barely making it, they're chugging as best as they can to get across the ocean,"" he said.
""Key West, where I live, is only 90 miles for Havana so it's a relatively short distance to landfall although the Florida Straits can be a pretty treacherous body of water to cross."" 
While it is possible that the occupants of this vessel were picked up at sea and the boat was left to drift, Bill Klipp believes it is more likely that the weather and ocean currents took it off course.  
""If that boat could tell its story it would tell a story of real despair and desperation, that's for sure,"" he said.
""Obviously the occupants didn't make it and that's kind of a sad story there but that's unfortunately a story that's happened too much over the last couple of decades.""
It is the first time such a vessel has been recorded being washed up in Europe according to Curtis Ebbesmeyer, a retired oceanographer based in Seattle who tracks ocean debris.
He said it could take months or years for it to make the journey of more than 4,000 miles across the Atlantic.
""The drift rate depends on how much the vessel is sticking out of the water and the rate could be a matter of six months or it could be a matter of years depending on whether the vessel drifted around some of the garbage patches in the Atlantic or made a straight journey across,"" he said.
Mr Ebbesmeyer said the vessels ""symbolise what price people are willing to pay to gain their freedom in the United States"".
""I would reflect on questions. Did the people make it? Are they in the United States? Did they die? Did they perish a terrible death out in the middle of the Atlantic?"" 
""They're really worth moments of reflection as you walk by,"" he said.
Standing on Cliffoney beach as the waves of the north Atlantic break beneath a grey sky, Gordon Fallis said he is glad he discovered more about the boat. 
""It's just great to be able to contact people who are able to identify it for me otherwise I would have just walked on past it thinking ""that's a strange boat on the beach"" and that would have been the last I would have heard of it,"" he said.
While the fate of those on board may never be known, the discovery has helped to bring the story of the Cuban refugees to people thousands of miles away.

The petition, which has been signed by over 1,000 people, was delivered to Chief Minister Howard Quayle this week.
The MHK said it showed a ""clear desire... to help"", but it was ""not simply a case of opening our doors"".
The government had previously stated the island could not provide the ""level of support"" needed to help refugees.
Campaigners want the Manx government to reconsider taking in refugees through the UK's Syrian Vulnerable Persons Resettlement Scheme. 
The scheme has helped around 4,500 of those in the ""greatest need"" resettle in the UK.
The petition calls for the new government, which has taken up power since the last decision on refugees was made, to reconsider and take in 25 Syrians by 2020.
Mr Quayle said the Council of Ministers would revisit the ""complex and highly emotive"" issue, but said ""nothing has changed"" in terms of the island's ""constitutional position"".
""There is a clear desire within our community to help Syrian people and this is reflected in the number of people who have signed the petition,"" he said.
""However, it is not simply a case of opening our doors to accept a relatively small number of refugees - there are many factors to consider.""
A government spokesman added that as a Crown Dependency, the Isle of Man ""cannot act on its own and must adhere to UK policy on refugees"".
Since the outbreak of the conflict in Syria, the Manx government has donated more than £500,000 through the International Development Committee.

The ban on travel to the United States by people from a list of mainly Muslim countries has caused widespread political protest. 
While it is being discussed at top government level, it is also impacting individuals.
Milad Korkis has lived in Northern Ireland for three years.
He is married to Holly, an American, and both work with a Christian charity. 
They were due to visit Holly's family in Pennsylvania in April.
""My travel document says that I am from Syria,"" Mr Korkis said.

About 1,000 demonstrators gathered in Cardiff, with more in Swansea, Bangor, Aberystwyth and Cardigan.
First Minster Carwyn Jones has said a state visit to the UK by the US president  ""should be put on hold"".
But the UK's Welsh Secretary Alun Cairns said he would welcome Mr Trump to Wales.
On Friday, Mr Trump signed an executive order indefinitely banning all Syrian refugees and suspending the entry of all nationals from seven Muslim-majority countries.
The ban applies to nationals from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen.
Cardiff has one of the largest Somali communities in the UK.
Youth worker Ali Abdi said: ""I think it's important to get behind protests like this. Today it's the Muslims, tomorrow it could be any other community just like us who are going to be persecuted.
""I think it's great to be standing side by side in solidarity.""
American student Ash Cox organised the protest in Cardiff.
She said: ""My ancestors on my father's side were Jewish immigrants seeking religious freedom.
""For us to turn away those seeking religious freedom now is really hypocritical.""
Shavanah Taj, Welsh Secretary of PCS union accused President Trump of ""normalising hatred, racism, bigotry, inequality and injustice.""
""That is not something we should be signing up to,"" she said. 
Katie Gill joined the protestors in Bangor.
""If it makes the person who delivered my daughter - a man from Libya - feel a little more assured that people don't think the same, that's something in my eyes.""
Swansea protestor Bailey Ann said: ""There could be a lot of young people that agree with Trump that will start being nasty to people of the same age from a different culture. 
""There's no need for it. We should all be living in a peaceful, sound world.""
Former Plaid Cymru assembly member and chief executive of Youth Cymru, Helen Mary Jones attended the protest in Cardiff.
She said: ""A lot of young people in minority communities are feeling really frightened in this kind of environment and they need to hear the message that we're sending today.
""Refugees are welcome in our communities and we won't put up with people not being allowed to travel because of the colour of their skin or the faith that they believe in.""
Downing Street has rejected calls to cancel the state visit, saying it would be a ""populist gesture"".
Mr Jones has told Prime Minister Theresa May that a state visit from Mr Trump would be ""difficult in current circumstances"" at their meeting in Cardiff on Monday.
He said the UK has to ""deal"" with the US government, ""but that doesn't mean we simply accept without criticism everything that is said.""
Mr Cairns said while he disagreed with the immigration ban, he would ""of course"" welcome Donald Trump to Wales. 
He told the BBC's Good Morning Wales programme that ""positive engagement"" was the best way to work with the new US president.
Protestors began gathering in Cardiff's Queen Street before 19:00 GMT on Monday, swelling to about 1,000 people despite the rain.
A further 700 demonstrators descended on events in Swansea, on Aberystwyth's prom, and in Bangor's city centre in Gwynedd.
About 40 anti-Trump protestors gathered outside Cardiff City Hall where the Joint Ministerial Committee, which included Prime Minister Theresa May, was held earlier in the day.
Some unfurled a banner reading: ""Deals with the Devil"", and as Mrs May left City Hall there were boos and shouts of ""Theresa the Appeaser"".
Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood said: ""Trump's actions have rightly been met with anger around the world and should be condemned without reservation by us all.""
Shadow Defence Secretary Nia Griffith told the House of Commons she was ""embarrassed and ashamed"" by Theresa May's decision to ""hold Trump's hand instead of holding him to account"".

http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-38794831,refugee,30 January 2017,By Faisal Irshaid,Twitter feed marks 1939 US refugee block of Holocaust victims,"On the day that President Donald Trump banned immigration from seven Muslim-majority countries, a Twitter bot was also sharing the names of Jewish refugees on a ship which was turned away from the United States, some of whom went on to die during the Holocaust.
Every five minutes, a tweet from the St Louis Manifest account shared the name of a person on board the MS St. Louis and described their individual fates after being denied entry to the US in 1939. 
The account was created on International Holocaust Memorial Day as an act of remembrance to those who died, but the timing meant it was quickly adopted by those protesting against President Trump's temporary halt on the US refugee programme.
Rabbi Charlie Schwartz and software developer Russel Neiss, both from the US, told the BBC they created the account to commemorate Holocaust Remembrance Day and to remind people of the need to help the vulnerable.     
The first tweet read: ""My name is Herbert Ascher. The US turned me away at the border in 1939. I was murdered at Auschwitz.""
Although the pair say the purpose of the account was not political, it was caught up in the midst of the debate over the president's executive order. 
The name St Louis comes from the German transatlantic liner that sailed from Hamburg, Germany, for Havana, Cuba in 1939. More than 900 people were on board, hoping to reach the US. Almost all were Jews fleeing the Third Reich in Nazi Germany.
When the St Louis arrived in Havana harbour in May 1939, the Cuban government admitted only 28 passengers. None of the others were allowed to enter the country or receive US visas because of strict immigration quotas. 
Left with no choice, the ship sailed to Florida but did not make it to the shores because the coastguards stopped it. 
Following the US government's refusal to permit the passengers to disembark, St. Louis sailed back to Europe in June. Of those on board, 254 could not seek safe refuge and died in the Holocaust. 
The account's description on Twitter reads: ""We remember the victims of Nazism turned away at the doorstep of America in 1939."" 
Rabbi Schwartz, who lives in Cambridge, Massachusetts, said: ""Creating the Twitter account and the website didn't take us more than an hour."" 
The account has attracted around 70,000 followers within a few days with many of the tweets shared tens of thousands of times.
The information was sourced from the US Holocaust Memorial Museum.
""Along with remembering those who were murdered in the Holocaust, we wanted the account to place the protection of refugees and vulnerable people in the national debate,"" said Rabbi Schwartz. 
""Many were moved by the story behind the account and some even referred to it during the recent anti-travel restriction protests."" 
Both creators say the reaction to the account has been overwhelmingly positive. 
However, some users have defended Mr Trump's policies and argue that the government must continue to secure the borders and impose tougher restrictions.
Other users criticised the link between the St Louis incident and the US presidential executive order on restricting the travel of people with certain nationalities, while others said blaming the US for the death of the St Louis refugees is not correct.

The Sherlock star condemned the ""slow response"" to the Syrian crisis during the curtain calls of Hamlet last year.
In a GQ interview, Cumberbatch said he has ""very strong opinions"" about ""things that matter"".
But he said he normally has to ""wrench myself back"" because, as a well-paid actor, he is portrayed as a hypocrite.
He told the magazine: ""One of the arguments was, when are you going to put a refugee in your house or your flat?
""And, you know, I do have a house, but it's empty, it's gutted, there's no electricity or water, so that wouldn't work, and I have a baby in my flat, there are no spare rooms...
""I wasn't saying, 'Yes, open the doors to everyone, yes, give them our jobs and our wives', and that whole kind of stereotype fear that nationalism has leapt on.""
Cumberbatch, who has a one-year-old son with his theatre director wife Sophie Hunter, is believed to have bought a Victorian house in north London.
He said he was prompted to make his speeches after seeing the photograph of dead toddler Alan Kurdi on a Turkish beach that drew attention to the refugee crisis earlier this year.
Cumberbatch added: ""It's not about privilege, it's about a child dead on a beach because he's tried to escape a war.""
He continued: ""I find it frustrating because I do have very strong opinions about things, and I do want to say things that matter, and that are important, and I have to wrench myself back.
""Because it's so easily framed by the right as 'Booo, who's he? He's a hypocrite, he's an actor, he's paid tonnes of money, who is he to tell us how to live our lives?'"" he said.
Cumberbatch also hinted that we might have seen the last of hit BBC TV series Sherlock.
""It might be the end of an era. It feels like the end of an era, to be honest. It goes to a place where it will be pretty hard to follow on immediately.
""We never say never on the show. I'd love to revisit it, I'd love to keep revisiting it, I stand by that, but in the immediate future we all have things that we want to crack on with and we've made something very complete as it is, so I think we'll just wait and see. The idea of never playing him again is really galling.""

http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-38777437,refugee,28 January 2017,None,Trump suspends US refugee programme and bans Syrians indefinitely,"President Donald Trump has banned the entry of Syrian refugees into the US until further notice. 
He has also halted the issuing of visas to the nationals of six other mainly Muslim countries, including Iran, Iraq, Yemen and Libya, for three months. 
Mr Trump said the measures were part of new measures to ""keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the US"".
Rights groups have condemned the move, saying there is no link between Syrian refugees in the US and terrorism. 
Under Mr Trump's wide-ranging executive order, all refugee admissions have been suspended for four months.
Mr Trump signed the order at the Pentagon after a ceremony to swear in Gen James Mattis as defence secretary.
During the ceremony, he said:  ""I'm establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America. We only want to admit those into our country who will support our country and love deeply our people.""
The text of the order was released several hours after it was signed. Among the measures are:
However, a mention of creating ""safe zones"" within Syria, seen in an earlier draft, was removed from the final order. 
The order also said all immigration programmes should include questions to ""evaluate the applicant's likelihood of becoming a positively contributing member of society.""
In a TV interview broadcast earlier on Friday, the president said Christians would be given priority among Syrians who apply for refugee status in the future.
Other measures include a broad review of the information required from all countries to approve a visa; a review of visa schemes between nations to ensure they are ""truly reciprocal"" for US citizens; and the immediate suspension of the Visa Interview Waiver Programme.
But the document says exceptions to most restrictions could be made on a case-by-case basis.
President Trump also signed an executive order aimed at rebuilding the military by ""developing a plan for new planes, new ships, new resources and new tools for our men and women in uniform"".
Last year, Mr Obama's administration admitted 10,000 Syrian refugees into the US. Neighbouring Canada - whose population is a ninth of that of the US - took in 35,000.
During the election campaign, Mr Trump suggested a ""total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country's representatives can figure out what is going on"".
But he has made no mention of this since his victory last November. 
The executive order has been met with criticism from rights organisations, Democrats and notable figures.
Democratic Senator Kamala Harris noted that the order had been signed on Holocaust Memorial Day. ""Make no mistake - this is a Muslim ban,"" she wrote.
""During the Holocaust, we failed to let refugees like Anne Frank into our country. We can't let history repeat itself,"" she said.
And New York Mayor Bill de Blasio said he was ""profoundly saddened"" and the president had sent ""a shamefully different message"" than the country's founding beliefs.  
Malala Yousafzai, the teenage Nobel Peace Laureate who was shot by the Taliban following her advocacy for women's education in Pakistan, wrote that she was ""heartbroken"".
""America is turning its back on a proud history of welcoming refugees and immigrants - the people who helped build your country, ready to work hard in exchange for a fair chance at a new life,"" she added.
Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg also posted a lengthy note, saying he was ""concerned"" about the president's executive orders, and noting that he, like many Americans, is the descendant of immigrants.
The head of American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) condemned the use of the words ""extreme vetting"", saying it was a ""euphemism for discriminating against Muslims"".
""Identifying specific countries with Muslim majorities and carving out exceptions for minority religions flies in the face of the constitutional principle that bans the government from either favouring or discriminating against particular religions,"" Anthony Romero said in a statement.

Thousands of Nicaraguans have fled their country to escape the political crisis there.  
The march was called after an anti-migrant demonstration a week ago ended in clashes and many arrests. 
That demonstration was condemned by the government, the private sector and several human rights organisations.
Many of those taking part in Saturday's march carried banners condemning Nicaragua's President Daniel Ortega.
They demanded justice for hundreds of people killed in four months of anti-government protests there. 
Protesters blame the security forces and paramilitary groups loyal to the Nicaraguan government for the violence while the authorities have labelled the protesters as ""terrorists"".
President Ortega has rejected calls to step down to defuse the clashes.
The United Nation's refugee agency (UNHCR) said recently that an average of 200 Nicaraguans a day were applying for asylum in neighbouring Costa Rica.
More than 20,000 Nicaraguans have so far requested refugee status in Costa Rica.

Mr Trudeau underscored his government's commitment to bringing in ""those fleeing persecution, terror & war"". 
The US Department of Homeland Security said the entry ban would also apply to dual nationals of the seven countries.
However, Mr Trudeau's office says Canadian dual nationals are exempt. 
""We have been assured that Canadian citizens travelling on Canadian passports will be dealt with in the usual process,"" a spokeswoman for Mr Trudeau said in an emailed statement. 
US President Donald Trump's National Security Adviser Mike Flynn ""confirmed that holders of Canadian passports, including dual citizens, will not be affected by the ban,"" the statement said. 
Canada's Immigration Minister Ahmed Hussen is a dual national who arrived as a Somali refugee. 
Within hours, Mr Trudeau's tweets had been shared more than 150,000 times. 
""Welcome to Canada"" also became a trending term in the country. 
Mr Trudeau, who gained global attention for granting entry to nearly 40,000 Syrian refugees to Canada over the past 13 months, also sent a pointed tweet that showed him greeting a young refugee at a Canadian airport in 2015. 
On Friday, Mr Trump signed an executive order suspending entry to the US from Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Iran, Somalia, Libya, and Yemen for 90 days. 
The US's entire refugee admissions programme has also been suspended for 120 days. Those fleeing Syria as refugees are banned until further notice.
The executive orders created confusion in airports around the world as immigration and customs officials struggled to interpret the new rules. 
The Canadian government is also in contact with the US administration ""to get more clarity"" on how the executive orders will affect Canadians citizens travelling to the US, said federal Transport Minister Marc Garneau. 
On Saturday, the US State Department confirmed to the BBC that all travellers - including those with dual nationality - from one of the seven designated countries will be barred from entering the US.
That includes people with valid immigrant or non-immigrant visas.

Mr Trudeau has refrained from criticising Mr Trump, despite the fact the two leaders have divergent political views. 
In recent media appearances, the prime minister has focused on the long friendship between Canada and the US and the deep economic ties between the two nations. The US is Canada's primary trading partner. 
Canada plans to allow 300,000 immigrants into the country in 2017, mostly through economic immigration, though that figure includes 40,000 refugees.

http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-37413710,refugee,20 September 2016,None,Nine arrested after Greek refugee camp burns,"Nine people have been arrested after a large fire destroyed parts of the Moria refugee camp on the Greek island of Lesbos. 
Up to 4,000 migrants were evacuated from the camp, as the blaze destroyed tents and prefabricated homes.
No fatalities were reported, but large areas of the camp, which was already crowded, were left unusable.
The Greek government said it would send a ship to hold at least 1,000 people as a temporary overflow area.
Early reports suggested a riot broke out as rumours of imminent mass deportations to Turkey spread. Other witnesses said it was the result of an argument over food.
The nine people arrested under suspicion of starting the blaze included people from Afghanistan, Iraq, Senegal, Syria and Cameroon, the AFP news agency reported, citing a police source. 
Additional riot police have been dispatched to the island.
The fire destroyed at least 30% of the camp, according to Aris Vlashopoulos, an aid worker with the Swiss charity SAO.
""People are returning to the camp now as I can see. But the biggest number of the refugees are already on the streets, sleeping outside,"" he added.
The destruction at Moria has put further pressure on the island, which is already far beyond its capacity. 
There are some 5,600 refugees currently in Lesbos, according to the UN, but the island only has capacity for 3,600. 
Greece's shipping minister, Thodoris Dritsas, announced immediate plans to lease a ship with capacity for 1,000 refugees to relieve pressure on the overcrowded island.
The camp at Moria also housed a number of unaccompanied minors. Those children had been safely evacuated to another facility as a temporary measure, and would be moved to Athens, state broadcaster ANA reported.
Humanitarian worker Fotini Rantsiou said tensions in the camp had been high before the fire. During the morning a man waiting for news of his asylum application became frustrated with the process and shouted ""freedom"", provoking alarm among 2,000 people in the camp and a later hunger protest.
Many on the island are afraid of being returned to Turkey or their home countries.
""Riots are not unusual in Moria,"" she said.
The situation on Lesbos is tense because many refugees land there and are held on the island until their asylum claim is fully processed. 
Those granted asylum are permitted to journey to the Greek mainland, while others are turned back.
Overcrowding has also fuelled tensions among residents on Lesbos and on neighbouring Chios. 
There were scuffles last week during a protest against the Greek government on Chios, and Greek media reported that a rally was held on Lesbos on Monday evening. The mayor was verbally abused by ultra-nationalists who started shouting ""throw them into the sea"", according to Greek website Kathimerini.
An estimated 13,500 migrants and refugees are staying on the Greek islands. 
In March, the EU agreed to work towards visa-free travel for Turkish citizens to Europe's Schengen zone in exchange for Ankara's assistance in curbing migrants crossing to the islands.

http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-38654991,refugee,17 January 2017,None,Nigeria air strike error kills dozens in refugee camp,"A Nigerian military jet has mistakenly bombed a camp for displaced people in the north-east, killing at least 52 people and injuring many more.
Aid workers are among the dead in Rann, with the Red Cross saying six of its employees were killed.
The MSF aid agency said that over 200 people had been injured and appealed for help with medical evacuations.
President Muhammadu Buhari, whose army is fighting Boko Haram militants, expressed dismay and urged calm.
The attack took place near the border with Cameroon, where the military is engaged in what it calls its final push against Boko Haram.
It is thought to be the first time Nigeria's military has admitted to making such a mistake.
Red Cross spokeswoman Aleksandra Matijevic said that along with the staff killed, more than a dozen of the group's volunteers, who arrived on Tuesday to deliver food to the thousands of displaced people, were wounded.
""Our thoughts are now with the families of our colleagues who have lost their loved ones,"" Ms Matijevic said, adding that the Red Cross would continue bringing humanitarian aid to those affected by the conflict.
MSF told the BBC that its organisation also had medical teams working in the Rann camp when the bombs struck. 
""More than 50 people have been killed,"" said Hugues Robert, head of MSF's emergency response. 
""Our team was there and counted the bodies, and more than 200 people have been wounded following these two different blasts from aerial bombardment,"" he said. 
MSF said it had teams in Cameroon and Chad ready to treat wounded patients.
Many of the casualties, it said, were believed to be displaced people who had fled from areas where Boko Haram had carried out attacks.
Gen Rabe Abubakar, a spokesman for the Nigerian military, said that some ""remnants"" of Boko Haram had been detected outside Rann and the military had acted to eliminate them. 
After the military realised its mistake, they were ""all in pain"", he said.
""However, in a military operation such as this, from time to time these things do occur,"" he added. 
""Even though it was highly regretful, it was never intended."" 
Gen Lucky Irabor, who commands counter-insurgency operations in the north-east, said there would be an investigation.
A spokesman for the Nigerian president said the administration would offer help to the government of Borno state ""in attending to this regrettable operational mistake"". 
Boko Haram has caused havoc in Africa's most populous country through a wave of bombings, assassinations and abductions.
It is fighting to overthrow the government and create an Islamic state.
The group has stepped up attacks in the past few weeks as the end of the rainy season enabled its fighters to move more easily in the bush.
Last month, the UN launched a $1bn (£800m) appeal for those facing hunger and starvation in the region.
It said nearly 5.1 million people in three north-eastern states were expected to face serious food shortages as for a third year in a row farmers had been unable to plant, fearing unexploded improvised devices left behind by militants.
Urgent aid was needed for some 100,000 people, mostly children, at risk of dying of starvation.

http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-38573558,refugee,14 January 2017,By Jessica Murphy,Ahmed Hussen: From Somali refugee to Canada's parliament,"Ahmed Hussen came to Canada from Somalia as a refugee. Now he's the new minister of immigration. 
Along with thousands of compatriots, Ahmed Hussen fled war-ravaged Somalia for a better life in Canada. 
Hussen's journey took him from Mogadishu to Toronto and then on to Ottawa's Parliament Hill, where the former Somali refugee was named this week as the country's newest minister of immigration in a reshuffle of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's Cabinet. 
It was a fast political rise for the rookie politician, and will put Hussen, who arrived in Canada in 1993 as a 16-year-old, in charge of the complex portfolio that oversees who is welcomed into the country.
Friends say the lawyer and social activist will be able to draw from personal experience in his new role. 
Mahamad Accord, who has known Hussen for years through his work with the Canadian Somali Congress, says his friend has not forgotten his modest roots despite walking Canada's corridors of power. 
""He didn't change,"" he says. ""The people around him changed.""
Accord recalls Hussen offering him help a few years back. The Somali community in the provinces of Ontario and Alberta were struggling to tackle the deaths of dozens of young Somali men due to drug and gun violence. 
He says Hussen did not shy away from speaking openly about the problems plaguing the Somali community in Canada, from high rates of poverty and unemployment to gang involvement. 
But Hussen was also aware of how the community could be stigmatised, and was always careful in how he spoke and presented himself. Accord says his friend would tell him ""we need to change people's perception of us"". 
""He expects high standards,"" he says. 
Accord admits he was sometimes jealous of the lawyer and social activist's ability to get across a difficult message diplomatically. 
It was that ability that struck former Ontario politician George Smitherman when he first met Hussen in 1999. Hussen was then fighting for the interest of Regent Park, a multi-ethnic neighbourhood in downtown Toronto where he had settled with one of his brothers upon his arrival in Canada.
In 2015, he told the Toronto Star that a backlog in refugee applications for permanent residency at the time meant he could not qualify for a student loan. Living in the public housing allowed him to save enough to go to university. 
Hussen lobbied to help secure funds to revitalise the crime-ridden housing project, co-founding the Regent Park Community Council. 
Some long-time residents had to move out of their homes during the redevelopment and were fearful they would not be able to return; Hussen worked to ensure their interests were protected. 
""There was an extraordinary tension because there was distrust and concerns among tenants,"" recalls Smitherman. ""Ahmed had to very carefully but forcefully represent their interests.""  
Smitherman, who calls the 40-year-old Mr Hussen an ""old soul"", later helped him land a job working with former Ontario premier Dalton McGuinty. 
""He was someone who spoke with a calmness and an informed knowledge and a maturity that defied his circumstances, both as someone who was young and someone who had taken this awesomely courageous step of leaving Africa for Canada."" 
Mr Hussen swept his Toronto riding in November 2015, though he drew criticism for not living in the disadvantaged riding he was elected to represent.
Speaking last April in the House of Commons, he raised concerns about the recent drowning death of hundreds of migrants from Somalia and the Horn of Africa, saying: ""Asylum seekers are not criminals. They are human beings in need of protection and assistance and deserving of our respect"". 
Smitherman sees Hussen's background as both an asset and a possible disadvantage in the challenging portfolio. 
""It sets up for tensions also as expectations are increased,"" he says. 
Following his swearing-in, Mr Hussen, the father of three boys, told media he was ""extremely proud of our country's history as a place of asylum, a place that opens its doors and hearts to new immigrants and refugees"". 
Hussen has always referred to himself as a Canadian first and Somali second, says Accord. In 2015 Mr Hussen told the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation that he does not want to be labelled a ""Somali MP"".
""I'm a Canadian. Somali is my heritage and I'm proud of my heritage but I have a lot to contribute to Canada. And I'm a mainstream guy. I'm not limited by my community,"" he said. 
Hussen replaces John McCallum, a veteran politician who is going to become Canada's envoy to China after managing Trudeau government efforts to bring in over 39,000 Syrian refugees in the last 13 months. 
""The real message of the new appointment is that the government wishes to profile refuges as a more salient part of our immigration program,' says Jeffrey Reitz, a University of Toronto sociology professor. 
""But it does raise the question of the mainstream immigration programme,"" he says. 
The rookie minister will face challenges in the key, and rarely uncontroversial, portfolio. 
McCallum recently introduced contentious changes to Canada's popular family reunification programme, replacing a first-come, first-serve process with a lottery system to randomly choose 10,000 people who filled out initial applications to express interest. Critics say that reuniting families should not depend on luck of the draw. 
Another recent decision to scrap a rule limiting how long foreign workers can stay in Canada is being targeted by the opposition as potentially harmful to the country's work force in the long run.  Immigrant rights groups have been critical of the programme, arguing the workers under the program are vulnerable to abuse by employers. 
He will also have to defend a recent Liberal decision to significantly reduce the number of private sponsorship applications for Syrian and Iraqi refugees because of a current backlog. 
Canada plans to bring in 300,000 immigrants in 2017, the majority of them economic immigrants.

http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-37234429,refugee,1 September 2016,None,"Scotland takes in 1,000th Syrian refugee","Scotland has taken in 1,000 Syrian refugees since a summit last year aimed at easing the international crisis.
The Scottish government said the milestone was reached after 120 new refugees arrived in Scotland in the past week.
A refugee charity thanked all of those involved in the ""phenomenal response"" to the new arrivals. 
But it said the number taken in was ""tiny compared with the people in desperate need"". 
Last September's summit was attended by representatives of all Holyrood's political parties as well as dozens of interested organisations.
First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said at the time that Scotland should accept 1,000 refugees ""as a starting point for a meaningful discussion"".
She also established a taskforce with a £1m budget to co-ordinate Scotland's practical response to the crisis, which has seen tens of thousands of people apply for asylum in the UK.
The UK as a whole is committed to resettling 20,000 Syrian refugees through its Vulnerable Persons Resettlement (VPR) scheme over the next five years, with more than 2,800 people having been given refuge so far. 
Equalities Secretary Angela Constance marked the 1,000 refugee milestone by meeting refugees and support workers at an educational project in Edinburgh. 
She said the Scottish government remained committed to accepting a ""fair and proportionate"" share of the refugees coming to the UK, and urged the UK government to accept more refugees. 
Ms Constance added: ""It's been fantastic to see people extend the warm hands of friendship to their new neighbours. 
""However, integration is a long-term process, and local authorities have been working in partnership with third sector and community organisations to ensure that the right support is in place.""
David Bradwell, of Scottish Faiths Action for Refugees, said: ""A thousand people is worth marking - but it is still a tiny number compared with the people in desperate need.""
He added: ""The response from local communities across Scotland has been phenomenal.
""Yesterday I was in Aberdeen hearing about how volunteers are working with Syrian families to support their settling into life, with everything from offering lifts, babysitting, to supporting kids with their school homework.""
The UK government, which hosted a Supporting Syria and the Region Conference in London in February this year, has said it is at the forefront of the response to the Syrian humanitarian crisis, which has seen millions of people displaced by the long-running conflict in the Middle Eastern country.  
Commitments made at the London conference aim to create an estimated 1.1 million jobs for refugees and host country citizens in the region by 2018.
They also aim to ensure that, by the end of the 2016/17 school year, 1.7 million children - all refugee children and vulnerable children in host communities - will be in quality education with equal access for girls and boys. 
A spokeswoman for the Home Office said the UK had pledged more than £2.3bn - its largest ever response to a single humanitarian crisis.   
She added: ""There has been a tremendous amount of goodwill from local authorities and the private, non-governmental and voluntary sectors as well as from individuals across the UK.
""We are very grateful for all the local authorities who have offered their support and will continue to work with them to identify further opportunities to resettle Syrian families.""

Mr Dodevski, a 35-year-old Macedonian border guard, had agreed to cover for a colleague. 
Among the thousands of refugees hoping to cross the border that day was Noora Arkavazi, a young woman who had travelled with her family from Iraq.
Ms Arkavazi, 20, left her home in Diyala, an eastern province of Iraq beset by violence, early in 2016. Alongside her parents, brother, and sister, she followed a well-trodden path west - crossing the border from Iraq into Turkey, taking a boat to the Greek island of Lesbos, and eventually entering Macedonia.
There, as the family waited to learn if they would be allowed to cross into Serbia, she met Mr Dodevski. He saw something special in her eyes. ""It was destiny,"" he told the BBC.
When the couple met, the fate of the refugees in Macedonia was hanging in the balance, as Balkan countries closed their doors to migrants.
""I had a simple dream to live with my family in Germany,"" Ms Arkavazi told the AFP news agency. 
She speaks six languages, and when she arrived at the border unwell she was directed to Mr Dodevski because of his English skills. 
She told the BBC World Service's Newsday: ""The first time I went through the border I had a very high fever and I had fallen down many times. Bobi immediately sent the Red Cross to save me."" 
Mr Dodevski attempted to remain professional, he said, but a female colleague quickly spotted the signs of cupid's arrow.   
As Ms Arkavazi remembered it, his co-worker chided his lack of focus and told him: ""Oh, I think you're in love and someone has stolen your brain here on the border!'""
""After that I talked with him, and I felt like something lit me,"" she said. ""I wanted to talk with him more.""
Mr Dodevski put it bluntly: ""I see many, many girls - maybe [more beautiful], a little, than Noora. But I see something special in Noora's eyes, and I say: 'This is it. I must have Noora here to be my wife!'""
When she had recovered from her illness, Noora began helping the local Red Cross. 
Her fellow refugees in the Tabanovce transit camp could only wait for news about their status, but on the sidelines Noora and Bobi were quietly getting to know one another.
He took her and her mother to nearby markets to buy clothes and food. She was struck by the way he would play with the migrants' children, unlike his more serious colleagues.
One day in April, the pair were enjoying dinner in a restaurant and he was visibly nervous - shaking and drinking lots of water. 
""I told him no, you're joking,"" Noora said, ""but maybe 10 times he repeated this, 'will you marry me?'""
Won over, she agreed to be Mrs Dodevski. 
The couple married in the north Macedonian town of Kumanovo. While the groom is Orthodox Christian, his bride comes from a Kurdish Muslim family. They were joined by 120 guests of all faiths, including her Red Cross colleagues.  
Asked about their rapid engagement, Noora said it was love at first sight. ""This is what has happened between me and Bobi.""
Though her family successfully made it to Germany, Noora stayed in Macedonia with her husband and his three children. The five of them live together in Kumanovo. 
And they will soon be six. ""I am pregnant, four months!"", said Noora, laughing with joy.

Over the same period Scotland housed 249 Syrian refugees and Northern Ireland 104, Home Office figures show.
Nine of Wales' 22 councils had taken part in the Syrian refugee settlement programme up to the end of June, four more than three months earlier. 
Oxfam Cymru welcomed the increase but said the resettlement process remained ""painfully slow"" in Wales.
UK ministers have pledged to settle 20,000 Syrians in the UK by 2020 under a scheme launched in October 2015.
Between April and June Rhondda Cynon Taf resettled 18 refugees whilst Blaenau Gwent, Carmarthenshire and the Vale of Glamorgan took five each, as the four councils took part in the Home Office-funded scheme for the first time. 
The five authorities already involved were Neath Port Talbot, which has now taken 27 refugees, Swansea (24), Ceredigion (11), Torfaen (10) and Caerphilly (seven).
Other local authorities, including Wrexham and Anglesey, also have plans to accommodate refugees fleeing war-torn Syria.
Matthew Hemsley from Oxfam Cymru said: ""We welcome the fact that more families have been brought to safety here and we know that more refugees from Syria have arrived over the summer. 
""Yet we cannot ignore how painfully slow the resettlement process still is in Wales.
""While there is some improvement in terms of numbers resettled here, there is no doubt that Wales still could and should do more to help families who have seen their lives torn apart by this war.""
 Mr Hemsley urged the Welsh Government and councils to work closely together to speed up the system.

People arriving to see Swarm will enter a ""transit zone"" established at Butetown History and Arts Centre.
The play's title is based on a comment made by David Cameron at the height of the 2015 migrant crisis.
Audience members will follow a group of actors and a wider cast from the local community as they seek sanctuary.
Abdul Shayek, the artistic director of Fio theatre company, said it was designed to be an immersive experience.
He said: ""We have tried to immerse the audience into the piece. In order to do that, we have given them a role. Their role is that they are new arrivals coming to this transit centre, and they are getting processed.
""I think we need to ask ourselves the question, 'What happens if this happened to us?' And I think that's what we are trying to do with this show.""
The play takes place in and around the arts centre in Butetown, with camps and a medical room among the locations that have been created inside the building.
It was conceived by Shayek during 2015 as the migrant crisis dominated news bulletins.
Actor Christina Dembenezi is one of five core cast members who visited refugee centres as part of their research ahead of the production.
""It was really interesting to hear their perspective, and to hear from people who are anti migration and others who are in favour of migration.
""It is something really close to my heart because I am from a migrant family.""
Swarm will be one of the last events at Butetown History and Arts Centre, which has ended its activities and is currently for sale. Performances take place from 11-14 August.

Things do not get easier when a refugee arrives in a new country, possibly thousands of miles from family and friends. 
There can be language barriers, a lack of education or employment prospects and many women refugees face the added problem of raising their children in a new landscape, sometimes with very little support.
Those were among the issues that women refugees in Belfast raised on Saturday, at the Northern Ireland Community of Refugees and Asylum Seekers (NICRAS) women's integration project round-table.
It was an opportunity for people to come along and hear some of the incredible, and also harrowing, stories of women who are trying to make a new life for themselves in Belfast - and the daily struggles they encounter.
Yosra, from Iraq, is 29 years old. She and her husband were doctors in Baghdad and had to leave their home after he received a death threat from an extremist group.
She has been living in Belfast for 11 months and said she has found it ""very difficult"" to adapt.
""The most difficult thing is that we had to leave our jobs,"" she said.
""We came here to start from zero. In our country, we have strong family bonds. Here, we are alone.""
Yosra added that she has found it easy to make friendships since arriving with her husband and son. They are also expecting another child.
""The people have been very kind, and I feel much better because of their support and advice.""
Latoya came to Northern Ireland from Zimbabwe in 2013, with no family, no friends and no qualifications - but she said she always had hope for a new start.
""I'm trying to do my English and Maths GCSES, and I've also started at Belfast Metropolitan College, where I'm doing a level 3 personal training and fitness instructor course,"" she said.
However, despite Latoya's determination to get a good education, it has not always been easy.
""I don't have anyone,"" she said.
""I came on my own, and the heart-breaking thing about it is that I don't know how to get in contact with my mum, or my family back home.""
Asked if she thinks she will ever return to Zimbabwe; Latoya's reply is matter-of-fact but very sad.
""I wish to be with family, but even if I was to go back home what would I be going to?"" she said, ""If I arrived at the airport they'd kill me straight, that's how it is, I ran away in fear for my life.""
Kanyesa, who is also originally from Zimbabwe and arrived in Belfast three years ago, said her experiences here have been mainly positive.
""At times like now, at Christmas, it's very hard, but it is great,"" she said.
""I'm still learning, my English is getting better - I'm still adapting to Irish stew too, my kids love it.""
Kanyesa added that while her home is now in Northern Ireland and that her children love living here, she makes a conscious effort to share her Zimbabwean culture with people in Northern Ireland.
""I share it with my neighbours, who are great, and my culture is a big part of who I am,"" she said.
Out of all the women I spoke to, Mimi has been living in Northern Ireland for the longest period of time. She arrived in January 2009 from the Democratic Republic of Congo.
""In the beginning, it was so difficult for me, life was so horrible,"" she admitted.
""Coming into this situation is not an easy life, I spoke no English - just 'Hi, how are you'. Basic phrases only.""
Mimi said the last seven years have brought their challenges, but today, she has a vastly different outlook than when she first arrived, alone and scared.
""Northern Ireland for me looks like home - I love it.
""I'm not sure if today I could go back to my home country, now Northern Ireland is home for me.""

The Home Affairs select committee found five of the 22 Welsh councils had taken a total of 78 refugees by March. 
The government has a target of settling 20,000 Syrians in the UK by 2020.
The Welsh Local Government Association said 100 more had settled in Wales since the figures were calculated.
The five Welsh local authorities named in the report, entitled Migration Crisis, were:
The report said the UK Vulnerable Persons Resettlement Scheme started well, and there were ""signs the co-operation necessary between central government, local authorities, and the various agencies involved is working efficiently"".
However it added: ""It is clear from the recently-published statistics that more local authorities need to contribute to providing asylum accommodation, including for Syrian refugees.
""There is now a two-tier system among local authorities, with some providing support to Syrian refugees and others not doing so.""
The WLGA said Wales' councils had played a full role in the resettlement scheme and were having to plan for a long-term process.
Dyfed Edwards, the group's migration spokesman, said: ""More Welsh councils are standing at the ready to receive refugees as the UK-wide scheme progresses over the coming months and years.
""Our councils are acting with urgency, with a wide range of national partners and work is well underway to prepare Welsh communities to help support the arrival of refugees in their area.""

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-38143217,refugee,29 November 2016,None,Merkel reaches out to tearful Afghan refugee boy,"An Afghan boy thanked German Chancellor Angela Merkel and shed a few tears in front of her Christian Democrat (CDU) supporters, during an emotional debate on the migrant crisis.
Earlier a CDU activist urged Mrs Merkel to resign, condemning her ""laissez-faire"" refugee policy as ""a burden that we will not get rid of any time soon"".
There was applause when the Afghan boy, called Edris, said in German: ""I would like to thank you, Mrs Merkel"".
He was tearful when she shook his hand.
The emotional moment was reminiscent of Mrs Merkel's controversial encounter with a tearful Palestinian girl, whom she comforted on German TV in July 2015. The girl, Reem, feared deportation to a camp in Lebanon.
Last year, 890,000 asylum seekers arrived in Germany - an unprecedented influx. And in January-October this year the German authorities received 693,758 asylum requests. 
The largest groups in January-October were: Syrians (38%), Afghans (18%) and Iraqis (13.5%), the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF) reported. Many can settle in Germany as refugees fleeing war and persecution.
But the influx has put pressure on housing and the welfare system. The crisis also triggered criticism of Mrs Merkel, including within CDU ranks. 
The nationalist, anti-immigration Alternative for Germany (AfD) is now a serious rival to the CDU in some regions.
Mrs Merkel plans to run for a fourth term as chancellor in elections next year. She insists that Germany has a humanitarian and historic duty to help refugees.
There were boos when a veteran CDU member, Ulrich Sauer, told a regional CDU conference in the western city of Heidelberg: ""Madame Chancellor, step down.
""With your truly unparalleled 'laissez-faire' refugee policy you have burdened us with something that we will not get rid of any time soon.""  
The mood changed when Konrad Reuter, a retired teacher who helps refugees, introduced Edris and the boy's proud father.
Edris was lifted up to say ""thank you, Mrs Merkel"" on a big video screen, drawing applause.
""I am very, very happy,"" the boy said.
On the podium Mrs Merkel, smiling broadly, told him: ""Okay, you learned a lot of German already. Do you sometimes speak German?""
Edris said: ""I only speak [German] to my dad.""
Mrs Merkel replied: ""You speak German to your dad? That's pretty good already. Is your mum here too? No, oh well then keep on practising.""
Edris was heard saying ""I wanted to touch your hands once"" - prompting Mrs Merkel to go over to the side of the hall, where she met Edris and his father. Edris wiped away tears as she shook his hand, surrounded by photographers.

Some UK residents are entitled to an Irish passport if their parents or grandparents were born in Ireland.
In 2015, the year before the Brexit vote, more than 46,000 applications were lodged from Britain - excluding Northern Ireland.
By the end of 2017 that number had nearly doubled to 81,000.
In an earlier version of this story, the BBC wrongly reported there had also been a surge in the number of rejections of British applicants.
A discrepancy between the number of applications made and passports issued through the London embassy amounted to some 15,000 people. However, Ireland's Department of Foreign Affairs said that figure did not represent the number of passport applications refused.
Instead it reflects the fact that not all applications from residents are submitted via the London embassy, it said.
The actual number of rejected applications is not clear. Applications can be rejected for a range of reasons including incomplete applications or uncertain identity.
Citizens of the Republic of Ireland, an EU member state, will retain visa-free travel benefits after Brexit, no matter the outcome of the UK's negotiations with the EU.
In the first five months of this year, almost 45,000 British people had requested an Irish passport,  according to figures from Neale Richmond, Chair of the Irish Senate's Brexit committee.
London's Irish embassy has issued more than 176,000 since 2016 - more than 10 times that of any other office.
Mr Richmond said embassy staff were expecting 2018 to be the busiest year ever.
Each application for a standard 10-year passport costs €80 (£71).
You can claim an Irish passport (or Irish citizenship) if:
Several other exemptions apply for those resident in Ireland for extended periods, adoptions, children of refugees, and other special circumstances.
There has also been a surge in applications from Northern Ireland, where most UK citizens are automatically entitled to an Irish passport if they so wish.
Senator Richmond's figures show that applications from there grew from 53,715 in 2015 to 82,274 in 2017.
Excluding Northern Ireland, Mr Richmond said at least 10% of Britain's population were thought to qualify for an Irish passport.
""In light of Brexit many including a number of my own family members are staking their claim,"" he said - and ""there is no sign of this rush for Irish passports abating.""

Officials said the claims were false. The Harmanli centre is home to 3,000 people, mostly Afghan refugees.
Protesters threw stones at riot police, who used water cannon to disperse them.
Some 13,000 migrants are still stranded in Bulgaria, the European Union's poorest country.
In an attempt to prevent illegal crossings, the country built a fence on its border with Turkey and reinforced its border controls.
Residents of the town of Harmanli protested on Sunday, calling for the camp's closure after local media reported on the alleged existence of diseases there.
Authorities then temporarily sealed off the centre to allow health officials investigate, and banned people from leaving the facility.
""An artificially created tension led to this, following misleading reports that the centre is a hearth of infection,"" Petya Parvanova, head of the Bulgarian Refugee Agency, was quoted by Reuters as saying.
Tensions have been high in Europe, particularly in Greece, where tens of thousands of migrants and refugees remain stranded. Last week, an attack on a camp on the island of Chios forced 150 people to flee.

The set of sculptures called ""Shadows of the Wanderer"" by Brazilian artist Ana Maria Pacheco is carved out of a single lime tree.
At the centre, a young man carries an older man on his back, with 10 figures reacting in the shadows.
Amnesty International UK welcomed the work as ""timely and poignant"". 
Its director Kate Allen said: ""Visitors will experience not just their own reaction to the two desperate figures that flee, but also the varied and complex reactions of the other carved figures that witness their suffering.""
The cathedral said the depiction reflects current debates about exile, migration and the displacement of people struggling to escape persecution.
Ana Maria Pacheco said she was inspired by the ancient Virgil poem Aeneid, in which a Trojan Aeneas carries his lame father on his back, leading refugees from the burning ruins of Troy.
The exhibition in the cathedral's north transept is on display until 14 November.

http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-south-east-wales-38028520,refugee,19 November 2016,None,Refugee oasis in Cardiff is helping transform lives,"Every day more than 100 people cross the threshold of a former Methodist church in Cardiff. 
But they are not in search of faith. Instead they are looking for shelter, support, friendship and acceptance.
For many, entering the Oasis centre for refugee and asylum seekers marks the end of an often traumatic part of their lives and the start of a fresh future.
But while it is a lifeline for many, some people do not even know it is there - something staff hope to change.
The Welsh Refugee Council said Home Office figures showed 2,839 people applied for asylum in Wales between January and March 2016, while a further 2,871 received support between April and June.
Set up in 2008, Oasis Cardiff in Splott has helped hundreds of those who have fled war or political persecution from countries including Syria, Eritrea, Sudan, Afghanistan, Kurdistan, Albania, Libya and Iraq.
Run by nine part-time staff and dozens of volunteers, it provides a ""safe haven"" for those in need as well as providing meals, clothing, language classes, advice and activities aimed at helping people settle in the community.
But while it is a place of salvation to those who use it, staff hope to build stronger links with people in the community and educate the few who have not given users the ""warm Welsh welcome"" extended by most.
Centre director and founder Reynette Roberts said: ""We've had a couple of emails saying 'we didn't ask for you to come here', a few people that think we get funding from the council - they felt that we had come in and taken away funding from other centres.
""And someone [wrongly] thought we were the ISIS [so-called Islamic State] centre.""
But on the whole, Ms Roberts said the community had been largely accepting since it moved to its current location two years ago - and by opening its doors it hopes to encourage more people to learn about its work. 
""Our work here is very wide-ranging and we're looking forward to sharing this as well as giving people an opportunity to hear some of the stories of the refugees and asylum seekers who come here,"" she said.
""People come here and they feel secure. They meet people that are from their area or speak their language.
""We had a young boy from Asia who would not go to school. The deal was he would do English classes here. Now he has gone to college and he's grown in confidence so much. It's lovely to see.
""There was also a Sudanese chap who didn't speak any English but he got his refugee status. We were able to help him with employment through Jobs Growth Wales and he's gone on to get a job working with security at Cardiff Castle.""
""To see people develop, stand on their own two feet and have the confidence to live their own lives is really important,"" she added.
""That's important because we don't want them to come in here and be dependant on us. 
""They've gone through hell both there and in their journey. We have people who lost family members in the Mediterranean Sea so it's often very traumatic. But to see them come through that is really rewarding.""
And while not everyone in the immediate vicinity may be aware, news of its work is spreading.
""We get donations from Aberystwyth, Brecon... I was surprised, we've got someone coming from Norway to see what we do, and someone from Germany, and theatre companies who are interested,"" Ms Roberts said.
Phillip Latigo, 31, fled Uganda for the UK in August 2015 and said the centre was now a mainstay in his life.
A football coach in his native home, with the help of the centre he has completed training to allow him to coach in Wales.
He helped set up a football team at Oasis and the squad play in the Street Football Wales league in Newport. 
Through the tournament, he was selected to represent Wales at the Homeless World Cup in Glasgow in July as well as the Homeless 5 Nations football tournament in Belfast. 
He said: ""It's [the centre] made me build my confidence, it's made me friends and made me who I am.""
Mr Latigo now volunteers at the centre as a way to ""give back"" to those who helped him.
Zohrab Bairmov, 50, left Nagorno Karabakh, in the South Caucasus, in 1997 due to political unrest and after a period away from the UK is now seeking asylum again.
He said the centre was ""brilliant"" and had provided him with help and advice to further his asylum application.
""If I didn't have it [the centre], it would not be so nice for me because I don't have many friends in Cardiff.
""It's a very, very useful place for immigrants like me or even new arrivals.""
Refugees and asylum seekers are referred to the centre by a number of agencies, including the Welsh Refugee Council. But it receives no government funding.  
It costs about £4,000 a month to run and is solely dependant on grants and donations. 
It gets regular support from firms such as Tesco, Nando's and KFC which donate surplus food, while staff from local businesses have helped renovate and maintain the building.
But it is keen to recruit more volunteers and held an open day on Friday to encourage residents and firms to get involved.
""We already have strong relationships with many people and groups locally, but we are organising the open day to renew those links and build new ones,"" Ms Roberts said.
""I understand the pressures on small businesses and the limited resources they have to support worthy causes, but the need here is urgent and any assistance - however limited - is hugely appreciated.""

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-37908788,refugee,15 October 2018,None,Meghan: From actress to duchess,"Meghan Markle made her name as an actress, campaigner and blogger before marrying Prince Harry in May 2018 and becoming the Duchess of Sussex. 
It was announced in October that she is pregnant, with the royal couple's baby due next spring.
Ms Markle, who was hitherto best known for playing lawyer Rachel Zane in US TV drama Suits, was born Rachel Meghan Markle on 4 August 1981 and grew up in a prosperous part of Los Angeles.
Her mother's home is in an area known as the ""Black Beverly Hills"", where the average price of a home is $771,000 (£587,000).
Ms Markle went to a private primary school in Hollywood and started campaigning for gender equality at an early age.
At 11, she wrote a letter to the then US first lady, Hillary Clinton, lamenting a washing-up liquid's TV ad strapline: ""Women all over America are fighting greasy pots and pans.""
Within a month, manufacturers Procter and Gamble had changed the word ""women"" to ""people"".
""It was at that moment that I realised the magnitude of my actions,"" she later said. ""I had created my small level of impact by standing up for equality.""
At 15, she was volunteering in soup kitchens as her studies continued at a girls' Roman Catholic college, and she graduated from Northwestern University School of Communication in 2003.
A stint working as an intern at the US Embassy in Argentina made her think her path might lead her into politics, but she changed course when her acting career began to take off. 
Between auditions, she has told of making money by doing calligraphy for wedding invitations, using skills developed in handwriting classes at school.
Her father was a cinematographer on the hit 1980s show Married... With Children, and her first television appearance in the US was in an episode of the medical drama General Hospital in 2002, before moving on to roles in CSI, Without a Trace and Castle.
There were bit parts in Hollywood films including Get Him to the Greek, Remember Me and Horrible Bosses, and she was a ""briefcase girl"" on Deal or No Deal.
She also appeared in the sci-fi series Fringe, playing FBI special agent Amy Jessup, and her most famous role was Rachel Zane in legal drama Suits.
Ms Markle was in the show from its launch in 2011, but was written out in the finale of the seventh series, which aired in April. Fittingly, perhaps, she left after her character got married. 
In real life, Ms Markle's union with Prince Harry isn't her first marriage. In September 2011, she wed film producer Trevor Engelson, but the pair divorced two years later.
In September, it was reported that her ex-husband was producing a new TV show based on a man's custody battle with his ex-wife who marries into the British Royal Family.
In 2014, she began writing about topics such as food, beauty, fashion and travel, as well as her own story, on her lifestyle website The Tig. 
Ms Markle said setting up the website was an attempt to ""reframe the beauty content to include think pieces about self-empowerment"" and feature dynamic, inspirational women.
In one post, she explained: ""I've never wanted to be a lady who lunches - I've always wanted to be a woman who works.""
The site also carried candid blogs she wrote on every birthday. On turning 33 in 2014, she wrote: ""My 20s were brutal - a constant battle with myself, judging my weight, my style, my desire to be as cool/as hip/as smart/as 'whatever' as everyone else.""
She also grew a large social network profile, with 1.9 million followers on Instagram and more than 350,000 on Twitter. 
But she shut The Tig last April, and deleted her social accounts this January.
Her media career has gone hand-in-hand with support for causes that are close to her heart.
She tackled the delicate issue of the stigma around menstrual health in an article for Time magazine in March 2017 and was a Global Ambassador for World Vision Canada, which campaigns for better education, food and healthcare for children around the world.
As part of her role, the actress travelled to Rwanda for the charity's Clean Water Campaign. 
Ms Markle's commitment to gender equality has seen her work with the United Nations, and she received a standing ovation from an audience including UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon for a stirring speech on International Women's Day 2015.
Commenting on how she combined acting with campaigning, she said: ""While my life shifts from refugee camps to red carpets, I choose them both because these worlds can, in fact, co-exist. And for me, they must.""
Ms Markle, whose father is white and mother is African-American, has also spoken about coming to terms with her racial identity. 
In an article for Elle magazine, she wrote: ""While my mixed heritage may have created a grey area surrounding my self-identification, keeping me with a foot on both sides of the fence, I have come to embrace that. 
""To say who I am, to share where I'm from, to voice my pride in being a strong, confident mixed-race woman.""

http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-39801455,refugee,5 May 2017,None,'I love Australia' Trump says as leaders meet after refugee row,"Donald Trump called his relationship with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull ""fantastic"" following a meeting in New York.
It is their first encounter since an acrimonious phone call in February.
""We get along great. We have a fantastic relationship, I love Australia, I always have,"" the AFP news agency quoted Mr Trump as saying.
Protesters also gathered in Mr Trump's home city, the first time he has returned there since his inauguration.
Mr Trump said the two leaders had ""reaffirmed ties"" between their two countries, and discussed economic, trade, and national security co-operation, as well as migration issues.
Is the US a liability for Australia? 
They met on the USS Intrepid, a WW2-era aircraft carrier that was involved in the war against Japan in the Pacific.
Relations between the two leaders were strained over President Trump's reluctance to honour a deal to accept up to 1,200 refugees from Australian detention camps. 
Mr Trump had reportedly said his February call on the issue was his ""worst"" that day, and had previously tweeted that the refugee resettlement agreement was a ""dumb deal"".
But the US later said it would honour the agreement made by the Obama administration.
Travelling through New York in a limousine is nothing new to Donald Trump. But never before has he done so with the presidential seal on the side of the car. He had not set foot in New York for 107 days, the longest absence from his native city at any stage of his life. 
Inevitably, in a city where fewer than one in five residents voted for him, there was a hostile reception from protesters. By Big Apple standards, however, the demonstrations were small-scale.
Nor were there any fireworks on the Hudson during his delayed meeting with Mr Turnbull, another businessman turned politician.
In fact, both men seemed so determined to shrug off their famed testy phone conversation - Mr Trump with a nonchalant air, Mr Turnbull with a rictus grin - it ended up looking like strained and faux bonhomie.
As he met Mr Turnbull, Mr Trump said the refugee bill ""has been worked out for a long time"", and said media coverage of the phone call was ""a little bit of fake news, as the expression goes.""
""We got a little testy, but that's OK,"" he later added.
He also said he would visit Australia, which he called ""one of the most beautiful places on earth"", but did not set a date.
Australia is one of the United States' staunchest allies and troops from the two countries have fought together in all recent major conflicts including Iraq and Afghanistan.
Speaking at the event on board the USS Intrepid, Mr Turnbull said the ""stability and prosperity of our region over so many decades has been secured - and is secured today - by the United States"",  a commitment he said was renewed by President Trump.
It is thought the two leaders may have discussed North Korea as part of their talks on national security.
Tensions have been rising around the Korean peninsula, with repeated threats from North Korea and the presence of a group of US warships and a submarine.
Observers also say Australia is also concerned about how the Trump administration's America-first trade policy might affect economic relations. 
In one of his first actions after taking office, Mr Trump pulled his country out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal, a 12-nation trade agreement which would have included the US, Australia and much of the Asia-Pacific.

It had said the Dadaab camp, home to more than 300,000 Somalis, should shut down by the end of this month. 
But Kenya now says it has suspended the repatriation to allow more time for consultation and funding. 
Rights groups had expressed alarm over the initial deadline for closing the camps and called on Kenya to roll back its decision. 
Last May, Kenya's Interior Minister Joseph Nkaisserry  said his country would be working closely with the UN and the Somali government to repatriate the refugees so the camp could be vacated for closure.
Back then, he said the decision was final.
But as the deadline loomed, human rights groups accused the Kenyan government of coercing refugees to return home despite the continued insecurity in Somalia. 
Mr Nkaisserry said the decision to delay the closure of the camp followed a request by the UNHCR head Filipo Grandi. 
It is not the first time that Kenya has backed down from a decision to close the refugee camp. 
It had vowed to close down the camp last April in the wake of a deadly attack by Somali militant group al-Shabab on a university 100km (62 miles) away. 
The al-Qaeda linked group has staged several attacks on Kenya in recent years.

Abdullahi Sheikh Abas, 31, was picked by an electoral college to be a federal MP. 
He was up for election against Information Minister Mohammed Abdi Hassan.
Somalia has been holding indirect elections since October to renew its parliament as the country remains too dangerous for a national vote. 
Much of the country is still under the control of Islamist militant group al-Shabab, which is affiliated to al-Qaeda.
Mr Abas grew up and was educated in Dadaab, the world's biggest refugee camp, in north-eastern Kenya.
In Somalia's long electoral process, 135 traditional clan elders selected some 14,000 delegates, who formed 275 electoral colleges. 
From 23 October to 10 November, each electoral college voted for an MP to sit in the lower house of parliament.
The results are now being published and Mr Abas has been elected as federal MP for Kismayo in Somalia's Jubaland region. 
It is  not clear how Mr Abas sold himself to the electoral college, but BBC Somali analyst Mohammed Abdinoor says Somalis who stayed at home have strong sympathy for returnees like Mr Abas, who grew up in refugee camps. 
The newly elected MPs are due to choose a president by the end of November.

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-46013305,refugee,29 October 2018,None,Israeli strike 'kills Gaza youths planting bomb',"Three Palestinian youths have been killed in an Israeli air strike near the border between the Gaza Strip and Israel, Palestinian officials say.  
Gaza's health ministry said the dead were boys aged 13 and 14.
The Israeli military said it targeted suspected militants who approached the border fence and ""were apparently involved in placing"" a bomb next to it.
Hamas, the militant Islamist group which dominates Gaza, accused Israel of targeting civilians. 
The incident followed another escalation over the weekend.
On Friday night militants in Gaza fired at least 30 rockets towards Israel. The Israeli military responded with air strikes on what it said were more than 80 military targets in the strip.
The militant group Islamic Jihad said it launched the rockets after Israeli troops shot dead four Palestinians during protests on Friday along the Gaza-Israel border. 
The Israeli military accused Iran and Syria of giving Islamic Jihad ""orders and incentives"", and warned that its response was ""not limited geographically"".
More than 200 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli forces since the end of March - most during weekly protests along the border at which thousands have expressed their support for the declared right of Palestinian refugees to return to their ancestral homes in what is now Israel. 
One Israeli soldier has been killed on the Gaza-Israel border by a Palestinian sniper during the same period.
Protesters have also demanded the lifting of the decade-long blockade of Gaza that Israel and Egypt say they impose for security reasons.
Human rights groups have accused Israeli troops of using excessive force. Israel has said they have only opened fire in self-defence or on people trying to infiltrate its territory under the cover of the protests.
Palestinians have also launched kites and balloons carrying containers of burning fuel and explosive devices over the border, sparking fires in Israel that have reportedly burned more than 2,800 hectares (6,900 acres) of forest and farmland.

'The List' documents all 34,361 asylum seekers, refugees and migrants known to have died in Europe since 1993.
Erected on 14 July in Great George Street, Liverpool, it was torn down in mysterious circumstances at some point on Saturday night.
Liverpool Biennial, the arts event behind the project, has appealed for information from the public.
Director Sally Tallant said: ""We were dismayed to see it had been removed on Saturday night and would like to know why.
""It is timely and important to make The List public during a global refugee crisis.
""The List has been met with critical acclaim and we are doing everything we can to reinstate it, once we better understand why it has been removed.""
The List's removal has not been reported to the police.
It will be reinstalled in full early next week, Liverpool Biennial said.
The name of those who have died are compiled and updated each year by UNITED for Intercultural Action - an anti-discrimination network of 550 organisations in 48 countries.
The List project was a collaboration between UNITED and Turkish artist Banu Cennetoğlu.
She has translated versions of The List using public spaces such as billboards, transport networks and newspapers since 2007.
Liverpool Biennial commissions international artists to make and present work about the city and is a celebration of contemporary art which takes in public spaces, galleries, museums and online.

http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-37953344,refugee,15 November 2016,By Alastair Leithead,"Can Kenya close Dadaab, the world's biggest refugee camp?","Kenya's announcement that Dadaab, the world's largest refugee camp, would close at the end of this month has encouraged thousands of people to leave already, but without further preparation, it seems unlikely the government will be able to meet its own deadline, which has been condemned by human rights groups. 
Small shacks of wood, corrugated iron and scraps of tarpaulin cling to the sand dunes on the outskirts of Somalia's southern port city of Kismayo.
Tens of thousands of people displaced by drought and decades of civil war live in 86 camps around Kismayo alone.
And thousands more have been arriving in Somalia in the months since Kenya said it would close down Dadaab, the world's largest refugee camp.
At the height of the fighting and the famine in Somalia, Dadaab, with its sprawling stretch of refugee camps in the flat, dusty desert scrubland of north-eastern Kenya, was home to half a million people.
Today 280,000 receive help with food and shelter, healthcare and education, but Kenya says 25 years is long enough, and the camp must close by the end of this month.
Some have been flown back by the United Nations refugee agency (UNHCR), others have been brought by bus through Somali countryside still controlled by the Islamist militant group al-Shabab.
But the place they are returning to is a work in progress.
Somalia is still riven by clan divisions and regional political rivalries, and is only slowly stuttering towards becoming a functioning federal state.
""We need our people to come back, but the problem is how they can stay here, get a livelihood and how we can support them,"" said General Mohamed Warsmae Darwish, interior minister for the southern state of Jubaland which has Kismayo as its capital.
""People have no toilets, no shelter, no water, no education, no medicine - how can they cope?"" he said.
There are already tens of thousands of people living in camps for the displaced in Somalia, where aid agencies struggle to provide help and the new arrivals are increasing the pressure.
Mariam Ibrahim Mohammed arrived just a few weeks ago from Dadaab with her four children.
""Given the choice between here and Dadaab, I'd rather have stayed in Dadaab,"" she said.
""Since I came back, I have not been given anything. The money they gave us when we left has already been spent. Life is very difficult here, but I can't go back.""
Some call Dadaab a desert city, others an open prison, but pulling down a place where many of its inhabitants were born and have never left takes time and must be done within the bounds of international humanitarian law.
""The closure of Dadaab is the decision that the refugees themselves will reach if and when they want to return,"" said Mohamad Abdi Affey, the new United Nations special envoy for Somali refugees.
""If people want to come back to their country and need help, it is our mandate to help them, but we are not an advocate of return by any means.""
But the UN has been criticised for not doing enough to tell people they have the right to stay - whatever the Kenyan government says about closing Dadaab.
There is a small, sparsely furnished office in a UNHCR compound where refugees come to find out more about voluntary returns.
Falahas Mahila and her six children listen to what's on offer: $200 (£160) per family member when they leave, the same again when they get home, plus other grants to buy housing materials, healthcare or to pay towards education.
This amount has recently been increased, and it's a lot of money for people who have lived as refugees for so long, surviving on aid and assistance.
She is convinced Kenya is going to close the camp, and there are many rumours that if they don't take the money now, they may be forced to leave anyway with nothing. 
The UN says around 25,000 people have signed up to go home, but the uncertainty over their future is further complicated by Jubaland's decision to close its border to returnees until it has the facilities to cope.
The returns have been suspended. Some refugees have sent their possessions on ahead and sold off their makeshift homes, leaving them in limbo.
Duh Ali Hanshi has a fence of thorn branches surrounding her little patch of land and small wood and tarpaulin home.
She fled the fighting in Somalia six years ago and says she doesn't want to leave because it's not safe, and at least here there is health care and education. 
""We were told there's an instruction coming from the Kenya government that we have to go back,"" she said.
""I have children in school and I want them to continue with their education here, but right now we are living in fear.  We don't know whether to go back to Somalia or to stay here. We will have to go back if we must go back.""
Twenty-five years is a long time for any country to host hundreds of thousands of refugees, but with an election next year and fears of al-Shabab infiltration, there is a large dose of politics surrounding Kenya's decision to close the camp.
But there are fears that it could encourage the very thing Kenya is most afraid of - radicalisation.
Back in Kismayo, a group of young apprentice mechanics are learning how to repair an engine.
Most of them are recent returnees from Dadaab, sharing work and training programmes with those who have lived in camps around the city for years.
Mohamed Ali Abdi, 28, came back eight months ago. 
""When I left Dadaab it was my decision - there was a little bit of pushing - but I always wanted to come back to my country,"" he said.
But he understands the dangers of not providing young people with work.
""It's very possible that if the young men coming back from Dadaab are not given help by the government or aid agencies they could be recruited into al-Shabab.""
It's complicated - people can't remain as refugees forever, but how will a camp ever close if it offers people more than they would get at home? 
How can they return when security is still a major concern and when increasing the number of poor and dependent people jeopardises Somalia's fragile recovery - the long-term answer to the problem.
It seems the only way to close Dadaab is slowly, and that means Kenya will almost certainly have to backtrack on its plan to close Dadaab by the end of this month.

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-45787962,refugee,15 October 2018,By Sarah Finley,'The lucky ones were often terrorised',"The BBC's weekly The Boss series profiles a different business leader from around the world. This week we speak to Charlie MacGregor, founder of student accommodation group The Student Hotel.
Scot Charlie MacGregor says he will never forget watching the boats full of desperate refugees and illegal migrants trying to come ashore on the Greek island of Lesbos.
""Some boats didn't know where they were going, so would end up on the rocks,"" says the 42-year-old. ""Some [of those onboard] didn't even make it.
""The lucky ones that did were often terrorised, not only by the journey, but [fearing] what would happen to them next.""
This was in October 2015, when more than 2,000 people in unauthorised boats were arriving on Lesbos every single day, most of them Syrians escaping civil war.
Charlie was a volunteer on the beaches, helping to direct the boats safely ashore, and then offer the men, women and children water, food and other assistance.
He had been moved to fly to Lesbos to help after a friend had posted on Facebook about the situation just a few weeks earlier.
""As a dad with two kids my heart really went out to these families that were trying to get to the island,"" he says. ""There were young kids, women, all traumatised after fleeing war-torn countries.""
In going to Lesbos Charlie had taken time off from his day job as founder and boss of student accommodation company The Student Hotel (TSH).
Today the Scottish businessman balances his time running TSH with helping to lead the charity he co-founded in 2016, Movement On The Ground.
The charity helps refugees ""from the moment they arrive in Europe, until they're safe and sound in their new home country"".
Born and raised in Edinburgh, Charlie says that ""student accommodation is in his blood"".
His father had built student homes for the University of Edinburgh in the 1980s, and Charlie started his career working on those building sites at the tender age of 16.
A few years later he used two loans - one from a bank, and one from his dad - to launch his own student accommodation company in Scotland.
More The Boss features:
Then in 2003, aged 27, he decided he wanted to live abroad. So he sold up, repaid the loans and moved to Amsterdam to launch TSH.
The idea for the business was a pan-European chain of fashionable student accommodation buildings that are also hotels open to members of the public. So while most occupants would be students on long-term lets, business travellers or holidaymakers could rent rooms by the night. And there would be onsite restaurants, bars and gyms.
Charlie was convinced that the idea would work, but others were less than enthusiastic.
""When I first thought of the concept I was literally laughed out of a meeting when I presented my idea to a room full of developers,"" he says.
Undeterred, Charlie kept pitching his plans, and eventually a bank decided to back him. The first Student Hotel opened in Rotterdam in 2006, with other Dutch sites following.
Then the global financial crisis hit in 2008, and the business ran into trouble.
""Six times I gave the keys to the company back to the bank,"" says Charlie.
""The saving grace was that there was also no-one else in the market who would, or could, buy the buildings, so even though the bank tried to sell them, they couldn't.""
As a result the bank kept allowing Charlie another go at running the business, and eventually he was able to ride out the storm.
Today TSH has 11 sites across Europe, from Barcelona to Dresden, and another 12 in development, from Lisbon to Rome.  Locations in the UK are also now being explored.
Two years ago Dutch pension fund ABP invested €100m ($115m; £87m) in the business, and TSH says its annual turnover is now due to surpass €75m.
Architect Andrei Martin, a partner at UK firm PLP Architecture, says that TSH is helping to lead ""an exciting development"" in student housing, making it of a higher, more appealing standard.
""Operators like The Student Hotel, who cater to a predominantly - although not exclusively - young demographic are radically reshaping our expectations of student housing,"" he says.
But if running TSH was not enough work for Charlie, he spends part of each working day helping to look after things at Movement On The Ground, and visits Lesbos four or five times a year to help out personally.
Initially Charlie and the four other co-founders funded the charity themselves, but it now relies on outside donations.
Work the charity has so far done in the refugee and migrant camps on the island includes working with the Red Cross and Doctors Without Borders to introduce toilet and shower facilities, and weatherproof tents.
It has also started a football programme for children, and set up digital learning labs, so that the refugees and migrants can use the internet, learn to touch type and to code.
""Football is a great way of bringing people together,"" says Charlie. 
""And if people can leave the camp with a qualification for typing or coding, it would give them better opportunities.""

http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-37903194,refugee,8 November 2016,None,Migrant crisis: Hungary MPs reject Orban anti-refugee bill,"Hungary's parliament has rejected an attempt by Prime Minister Viktor Orban to block the settlement of refugees.
His ruling Fidesz party failed to attract the two opposition votes necessary for a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The bill had sought to rebuff an EU-set quota scheme that would relocate 1,294 refugees in Hungary.
It was the latest move in Mr Orban's anti-EU and anti-migrant drive, say correspondents.
But he was thwarted by the anti-immigration Jobbik party, which normally would have been viewed as a natural supporter of the bill but abstained.
Jobbik had demanded Mr Orban scrap a cash-for-residency bond scheme allowing wealthy foreigners to buy special state bonds for €300,000 ($330,000) giving them the right to live in Hungary. 
Jobbik argued the immigration ban should apply to all foreigners.
Mr Orban refused, calling the move ""blackmail"".
Mr Orban called the vote in parliament after a divisive referendum on 2 October, again over the EU's 2015 resettlement scheme to relocate 160,000 refugees across the bloc.
Of those who voted, 98% - or 3.3m voters - supported Hungarian Prime Minister Victor Orban's call to block the quotas. But only 40.4% of voters cast valid ballots, short of the required 50% threshold.
Nevertheless, he declared victory and immediately called the constitutional vote.
This is the second blow in a month for Viktor Orban, following the failure of his 2 October referendum. 
Now he can be expected to turn his guns on the Jobbik party for their ""treachery"" for refusing to support the constitutional amendment. 
Jobbik were prepared in advance for that accusation. 
As the results of the amendment vote were announced, Jobbik deputies unrolled a banner with the words: ""The traitor is the one who allows terrorists into the country for money."" According to Hungarian reports, a Saudi citizen who once had business contacts with Osama Bin Laden and who is also on an FBI wanted list, bought residency in Hungary under the bond scheme.
Hungary has already refused to accept 1,294 asylum seekers requested by the European Commission. It has taken the Commission to the European Court of Justice over the case, with a verdict expected next year. 
If Hungary loses, it will have no choice but to accept the 1,294. If the constitutional amendment had passed now, it would have blocked any future attempts by the EU to impose quotas on Hungary. 
Jobbik has been jockeying with the Socialists for position as Hungary's second biggest party.
Mr Orban's defeat in Tuesday's vote is an unusual blow for a man whose party won a two-thirds majority in parliament when he first came to power in 2010 and has since enacted six constitutional amendments.
The setback is likely to herald a period of increasing rivalry between his Fidesz party and Jobbik.
Immigration is a key battleground, and the constitutional vote was a chance for Jobbik to flex its muscles, correspondents say. 
""We are ready to vote for the amendment of the constitution but we are not ready for partial solutions,"" Jobbik leader Gabor Vona said in October. ""We can only support a solution which creates Hungary's real security."" 
Thousands of non-EU citizens - many from the Middle East, China and the former Soviet Union - have bought residency in Hungary with the ""foreigner bonds"".
Jobbik says more people have come into the country under that scheme than would have come under the EU migrant quota.
But it says it remains willing to support Fidesz's constitutional amendment if it backs down and scraps the scheme.

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/in-pictures-44873358,refugee,19 July 2018,None,The women who use traditional make-up as sunscreen,"Reuters photographer Clodagh Kilcoyne has created a series of portraits of Rohingya Muslim girls and women in refugee camps in southern Bangladesh, capturing their striking traditional makeup.
More than 700,000 Rohingya people have fled the destruction of their homes and persecution in the northern Rakhine province of Myanmar (Burma) for neighbouring Bangladesh since August 2017.
The Rohingya, who numbered around one million in Myanmar at the start of 2017, are one of the many ethnic minorities in the country.
Myanmar's military says it is fighting Rohingya militants and denies targeting civilians.
Kilcoyne photographed the Rohingya Muslim girls and women in refugee camps in Cox's Bazar, a city on the south-east coast of Bangladesh.
The makeup is called thanaka, a yellow paste made from the ground bark of a tree found in the dry central parts of Myanmar, and is used to decorate the cheeks of the women and girls in a tradition dating back centuries.
As well as a cosmetic, the paste acts as a protection against the strong sun, whilst keeping their skin cool.
The swirls of yellow paste dry into a protective layer and is an insect-repellent and helps treat acne.
The traditional makeup, which can be bought in the refugee camps, has brought a sense of normality to the lives of the Rohingya Muslim girls and women.
Juhara Begum, 13, seen below, told Kilcoyne: ""The makeup is my hobby, and it's our tradition.
""The military fired guns and slaughtered us. I live on top of the hill and it is too hot with the strong sun.""
Begum arrived in Cox's Bazar in September last year after fleeing a military attack on her village in Rakhine.
She had to walk for five days to reach the safety of the border and the crowded refugee camp of Jamtoli.
""I can live without eating rice but I cannot live without makeup,"" said Begum.
Zannat Ara, nine, seen below, from Kutupalong refugee camp, said: ""I wear makeup to keep my face clean and there are some insects that bite my face and this keeps them away, so this protects me.""

Thais Roque launched the Oxford Students Refugee Campaign in October to help people whose studies had been disrupted by war or persecution.
Her aim was to get fellow students to pledge £1 a month for two years. 
She says 11,000 people have signed up, with pledges and donations exceeding £240,000 over the two-year period.
Ms Roque said much of her education - in Brazil, Germany, and her current doctorate in Biomedical Engineering - had been made possible by scholarships so she wanted to give something back.
She said: ""Oxford have a lot of programmes that help people from other social groups... but there has never been a scholarship for asylum seekers.""
Now the money is coming in, the fund is working to identify potential candidates.
Ms Roque said: ""The response has been overwhelming - in just a few days we have been bombarded with emails from young people desperate to continue their higher education and pursue what some of them call their last chance.""
The first scholarships will be available in 2017/18, although the campaign is also hoping to help eight potential students who have been offered Oxford places this year.

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-45762466,refugee,5 October 2018,By Vincent Dowd,Artist sells 'Swiss passports' in UK ahead of Brexit,"Visitors to the Thaddaeus Ropac Gallery in London are normally intent on buying art. But for 24 hours this weekend it's open for the issue of Swiss passports - at a bargain price. The issuing authority isn't the Swiss government but American artist Tom Sachs.   
Tom Sachs has previously set up his temporary installation Swiss Passport Office in Brooklyn and San Francisco. 
On offer (in a batch of 3000) are apparently convincing facsimiles of a Swiss passport, which Sachs describes as ""one of the most desirable travel documents ever"".  
People who turn up at the gallery in Mayfair first have to lodge 20 euros with the receptionist and have their photograph taken before filling in an application form. No sterling currency will be accepted. Eventually applicants are ushered into an office to be quizzed by one of four officials seated at desks.
 Some of the information required is standard.  But questions such as ""Have you ever supported evil?"", ""How many sexual partners have you had in the last year?"" and ""How many of its Instagram followers has the BBC bought?"" go beyond the usual.
Sachs, who's 52 and from New York, says he doesn't believe in the concept of borders. ""But like money it's an illusion we all live and die by. So a passport is a symbol of that - and of course the right passport can be hugely beneficial to the holder.  
""I would claim that the passports we're issuing in London are the real thing - it's just not authorised by the Swiss government but by my studio. It might not work to get you through Heathrow Airport but it might still work other places. My 14 year-old nephew used it to get his first tattoo.""
Though initially convincing, the wording inside the passport might tip off even the least attentive immigration officer. One image is labelled  ""280 truckloads of Nazi gold laundered through Switzerland - estimated $7 billion net worth"".
But there are other passports in demand around the world. So did Sachs consider manufacturing US passports?
""For parts of my family it was always the Swiss passport that got you out of Nazi Germany.  It's the Swiss passport that allows you to avoid taxes all over the world.  
""It's the passport that represents the most elite culture in the world that's also the most polyglot culture. It's the golden ticket so that was why it was the right document for our art installation.""
In part, Sachs is in London for the annual Frieze Art Fair. ""But also because you're six months from Brexit I thought there'd be a real pertinence and even poignancy. 
""Or look at what's going on in the US with the Mexican wall or look at Syria. There are refugee issues around the world.  But at the moment there's nowhere better than London to be talking about matters of immigration and national identity.""
The passport Sachs carries is the dark blue of America, not the red of Switzerland. So is he considering changing that? He thinks for a moment. ""Not at this time.""
The Swiss Passport Office is open for business at the Thaddaeus Ropac Gallery in central London only until 6pm Saturday 6 October.  It's then open for viewing but will not issue travel documents.  Even for people with euros.

http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-36502341,refugee,15 June 2016,By Kristina Jovanovski,Making a living on Syria's refugee trail,"Mourhaf Lababidy is busy making falafels with his sauce made of yogurt, flour and lemon juice. It's homemade, straight from his tent at this petrol station-turned-makeshift refugee camp on a highway near the Greek-Macedonian border.
Mr Lababidy, along with a fellow Syrian he met here, set up shop selling bread, then added vegetables, and finally pizza and wraps.
""We are like Syrian people, we don't need anyone to give us ideas,"" he says.
Many of these shops have opened up in the last month or so, when refugees realised they would be here longer than they intended to and feared they would soon run out of money.
After the border with Macedonia closed in March, more than 1,000 people used to live here, but the authorities have been moving them to official camps. By 05:00 on Monday morning, word spread that they would be evacuated.
Many wanted to stay and were confused, not knowing where they were being sent. They were given time to pack up their belongings and most of them calmly boarded buses destined for official camps.
The numbers had been gradually going down in any case. No-one is certain why, but some believe that the migrants used smugglers to cross into Macedonia. 
Donations for basic goods have been been given out daily to the refugees, but supplies could not meet demand, meaning that they needed a way to sustain themselves and their children.
Such is the case for Mr Lababidy, who fled with his wife and two children, including a 10-month old, from Idlib in Syria at the end of February.
He takes out his phone to show what he says are recent photos from Facebook of bombings in his home town - one of a destroyed building, another of a man with blood all over his head with his eyes closed.
He owned a cafe in the city and the entrepreneurial spirit seems to have carried over to Greece, where he realised he might have to stay for a while and find a way to make money.
""We are only just trying to work, not just for ourselves but for our kids,"" he says, ""and you know, the food isn't good [here].""
The 34-year-old buys groceries and tools from the nearby town of Polykastro, where he goes by taxi.
Apricots at his shop sell for two euros a kilo, eight pieces of bread are one euro, while cigarettes go for two euros for one packet.
Where do the cigarettes come from? ""No comment,"" Mr Lababidy blurts out.
Competition is fierce among several other cigarette stands in the camp, including one just down the same lane of tents as Mr Lababidy's. 
There, Abdulkader Gafer sits behind a brown table with 11 packs of cigarettes. 
How's business going? ""Not good, but [I] sit down here in the morning to at night: two euros, maybe.""
This is his friend's business that Mr Gafer, 60, watches over, since he mainly uses a wheelchair because of neck pains.
The two met in Greece, where Mr Gafer has been for three months, following two months in Turkey after leaving Damascus, where he worked as a tailor. 
He says the packets are bought from a man in Macedonia who visits these camps to sell cigarettes because they are cheaper than those in Greece.
It is the most popular business at this camp, with three more stands selling just cigarettes.
In front of a row of picnic tables where people gather under shade, two Syrians make their own pita bread, selling six pieces for one euro.
Under a tent next to the driveway of the station is barber Mohamad Rashed, 23, who is cutting the hair of his Iraqi client in front of a pink Disney Princess-themed mirror. 
He also tweezes the eyebrows and shaves the man's beard - all for three to four euros, but sometimes he offers his services for nothing if someone says he does not have enough money.
At the end of the cut, Mr Rashed sweeps away the hair with a brush made of small tree branches. 
Business varies day by day. Sometimes 10 clients come, other times only three.
Mr Rashed, from Afrin in Syria, complains that in Turkey, he could work for a month and not be paid. 
""No-one will care about us, because we are also refugees there in Turkey,"" he says.
For Mr Rashed, his business is a way to get back some control over his own life.
""I get money here and I'm feeling comfortable, and I get the money because of the job, no one can give me the money for nothing.""
Inside his tent is a table with electric razors which he got at the petrol station, while the rest is from Polykastro. There are combs, a spray bottle, two bottles of body lotion and wet wipes meant to remove make-up.
On a street lamp next to Mr Rashed's tent, black string is tied around eight empty cans of strong beer selling for €1.50. Mr Rashed says the business belongs to his friend, who is sitting outside, wearing camouflage trousers. 
They met on the dangerous boat ride from Turkey to Greece. Mr Rashed says his friend ended up being the driver of the boat, because their smuggler got scared at the last minute.
Mr Rashed wants to continue working as a barber in Germany where he hopes to settle and bring his mother and sister. But first he needs to figure out how to get there.
Many here have tried to avoid the official camps in this area, some of which the UN High Commissioner for Refugees labelled as sub-standard. At the same time, they have no opportunity to move on to Macedonia.
While these businesses do not offer luxury living, they sustain the hopes of a life in the European Union for these refugees, because they can spend more time in Greece.
It is a way to take back a bit of control in a place where they have little. 
As for Mr Lababidy, the falafel shop owner, he is happy to go to any other country, as long as there are job opportunities. He does not see that happening in Greece, where he complains there is no work and his children have not been able to go to school.
""From [wherever] you are in Greece, you will live in misery,"" he says.

Home Office figures show Wales resettled 78 Syrian refugees between October 2015 and March while Scotland accepted more than 600.
Charities said the figures were ""disappointing"" and Wales ""should step up to the plate"".
The Welsh Local Government Association (WLGA) said more councils were at the ready and it was in active discussions.
Carys Mair Thomas, head of Oxfam Cymru, said: ""What is stopping all local authorities from welcoming these families?
""Ceredigion has become a trailblazing Welsh council despite never previously welcoming refugees, and should encourage others, with far more experience in these matters, to step up to the plate.""
Neath Port Talbot welcomed the most so far, 27, followed by Swansea with 24. Torfaen and Ceredigion took in 10 each, and Caerphilly seven. 
In May, Wrexham agreed to take in five Syrian families, while in April, Anglesey also agreed to accept 10 families over the next three years. 
All Welsh councils have committed to take part in the Home Office-funded scheme, which will resettle 20,000 displaced Syrians living in refugee camps in the UK by 2020.
In September 2015, First Minister Carwyn Jones called for more leadership on the refugee crisis, and indicated Wales would accept 500 to 600 refugees.
A total of 1,602 arrivals have been welcomed across the UK.
Oxfam said for Wales to meet its fair share, each council only needed to welcome fewer than 10 families each.
A WLGA spokesman said councils were dealing with ""challenging reception and resettlement issues"".
""A number of Welsh councils have already played their part. More are standing at the ready and will receive refugees later this year.
""We are confident Welsh authorities will play a full role in the next stage of a UK-wide Syrian refugee resettlement programme that is being coordinated by the Home Office.""
A Home Office spokesman said local authorities signed up to the the scheme on a voluntary basis.
He said councils were asked to ""think very carefully"" about whether they have the infrastructure and support networks needed to ensure the ""appropriate care and integration of these refugees"" before telling the Home Office how many refugees they are able to accept.

Chi Onwurah, who represents Newcastle Central for Labour described the find as ""upsetting"".
The image was stuck to a cupboard in a communal kitchen in an MPs' building opposite the House of Commons.
It shows an elderly man, with the message: ""Just £3 from you could clothe and feed this 12-year-old Syrian child for a week"".
Ms Onwurah tweeted: ""Upset someone in Parliament thought it funny to display this in the communal kitchen over the weekend.""
The shadow business and energy minister said she would be writing to the Serjeant at Arms of the House of Commons.
She said: ""If it was in a building where the public goes it would have been offensive, but it could have been anybody.
""Here it must have been someone who has a parliamentary pass, who lives or works here.
""It was sellotaped onto a cupboard above the kitchen sink, not just left lying around for someone to have a chuckle over - it was definitely there to make a point.
""There are obviously challenges around migration in Europe with the war in Syria, it's so upsetting in itself, and frustrating in terms of what we can do.
""But these are human beings, not to be demonised, reduced to a meme.
""If people want to have a laugh or a joke they should do that in their own office, this is a working space.
""I do find it offensive, I don't want those attitudes in my working environment, and shouldn't have to see that when I go to make a cup of coffee, or tea.""

http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-wiltshire-37796302,refugee,28 October 2016,None,Fake refugee camp built on Salisbury Plain to train troops,"A fake refugee camp costing £2.4m has been erected on Salisbury Plain, to better prepare troops for deployment.
The complex of 11 building shells or ""stone tents"" has been built at the New Zealand Farm Camp in Wiltshire, to replicate a terrorist or refugee camp.
It is the ""biggest single investment"" in a training camp in the area since Copehill Down village in the 1980s.
Maj Gen Richard Stanford, said: ""Facilities such as this are critical to enabling success on operations.""
To make way for the new ""modern, multi-purpose training camp"", a dozen buildings had to be demolished at an old World War Two training camp.
Along with street lighting, and a new public address system, tracks around the old camp also had to be upgraded to support warrior armoured fighting vehicles.
Gen Stanford said the investment would allow the Army to ""prepare in a realistic and challenging environment"".
Brig Neil Dalton, from the Defence Infrastructure Organisation (DIO), said the site's ""diverse training features"" provided a ""broad variety of challenging exercise scenarios"".
Clive Paxman, from Landmarc Support Services, said from the outset it had worked closely with the facility's ""end users"".
""The buildings have been developed so that they provide a realistic, challenging physical training environment through strategically arranged tunnels and overhead gantries to simulate different risks and threats.""
In 2012, the DIO was given planning permission to install 100 shipping containers on Salisbury Plain to replicate an Afghan village.
Copehill Down was built in 1989 as a mock village for troops to hone their skills at ""FIBUA"" - fighting in built-up areas.

The centre acts as an accommodation hub for refugees waiting to be sent elsewhere in North Rhine-Westphalia.
Everyone inside hall 18, where 180 refugees were staying, was brought to safety, according to reports.
As the fire raged, a thick, black plume of smoke could be seen across Duesseldorf.
The smoke drifted close to the flight path from Duesseldorf airport. 
The fire department advised those in the north of the city to keep windows and doors shut, reported RP Online (in German). Some 70 firefighters were at the scene.
Ben Smith, a former BBC reporter, was waiting for a flight when he saw smoke rising up on the other side of the airport. 
""The smoke was thick and pretty quickly a column was reaching up and flames started to appear,"" he said.
""It caused a bit of a stir among passengers but it became clear pretty quickly that it wasn't a plane or an airport building. 
""Flights were continuing to land as all this was going on. The fire wasn't that far from the runway but the smoke wasn't blowing [in the direction of the airport].""

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-45905294,refugee,18 October 2018,None,Trump makes new threat over US-Mexico border,"US President Donald Trump has threatened to use military force to completely close the US-Mexico border.
The warning, via a series of tweets on Thursday, comes as a new caravan of more than 3,000 migrants from El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala heads north.
Mr Trump has already threatened to cut all aid payments to the three countries over illegal immigration.
The group says they are fleeing violence and poverty. 
""In addition to stopping all payments to these countries, which seem to have almost no control over their population, I must, in the strongest of terms, ask Mexico to stop this onslaught - and if unable to do so I will call up the U.S. Military and CLOSE OUR SOUTHERN BORDER!,"" Mr Trump wrote.
The president has previously threatened to cut Honduran aid. The US sent more than $175m (£130m) to the country in 2016 and 2017, according to the US Agency for International Development.
The group of Central American migrants has made its intentions clear: they are heading to the US. 
Since he was on the campaign trail, Mr Trump has lambasted illegal immigrants, and this latest caravan comes after a major crackdown on migrants heading over the Mexican border. 
Changes to detention rules saw thousands of migrant children detained and separated from their parents earlier this year, sparking national and international condemnation.
The president's threats also come just weeks before the mid-term elections on 6 November, which could see Democrats unseating Republicans on Capitol Hill.
Mr Trump's recent comments are probably an effort to bolster support among his base by cracking down on migration.
Analysis by Anthony Zurcher, BBC News
This isn't the first time President Donald Trump has used an organised group of Central American refugees heading to the US to drum up support for his border security and immigration policies. With the mid-term elections 19 days away, however, the stakes are higher and the rhetoric is sharper.
It may not end up much more than rhetoric, however. Mr Trump's Twitter threats have, in the past, proven an unreliable indicator of future decisions. 
There could be political benefit to the president's accusations, lobbed toward Democrats, and the warnings to Latin American leaders - but presidential action would have consequences. 
Using the military to ""close"" the border would be enormously disruptive in states like Texas and Arizona (which, by the way, have two high-profile Senate races). The move would also complicate relations between the US and Mexico, as Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador prepares to assume the Mexican presidency in December.
A recent Fox News poll shows that probable midterm voters are more interested in preserving healthcare protections and ""reining in Donald Trump"" than immigration or border security. The president, with his tweets, is trying to change that. If he can't, it will be an election fought on uncomfortable ground for Republicans. 
The migrant caravan is currently making its way through Guatemala, mostly on foot, with several of the quickest already arriving at Mexico's southern border by Thursday.
Their journey began in San Pedro Sula, Honduras, on Friday.
Most migrants are carrying few belongings, taking what they can carry in backpacks, as they head out on the nearly 2,800 mile (4,500km) trek from Honduras to the US border.
Thousands of people and goods legally cross the US-Mexico border daily. 
While Mr Trump has sent national guard troops to the border before, it is unclear what he means by shutting it down entirely, and whether that would affect businesses or people with legitimate visas. 
And according to international law, the US cannot deport asylum seekers without first determining the validity of their claim.
Under pressure from the US to stop the migrants, Mexico has sent federal police to the border, though they are not officially there to stop the caravan.
Mexican officials said on Wednesday that those without papers would have to apply for refugee status or turn back.
US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo will be in Mexico this Friday, and US media report that he will discuss plans to stop the caravan.
""The surreal side of this perceived crisis at the border is that the border is more under control now than it was 15 or 20 years ago,"" Andrew Selee, president of the Migration Policy Institute, told the BBC.
Mr Selee said closing the border ""would wreak havoc on Mexican and American economies"".
""It could be a symbolic effort,"" he adds. ""A way of pressuring Mexico - but that would have a limited effect on illegal crossings and a huge effect on legal crossings.""
The Associated Press reports that many migrants do not have passports and have been using national ID cards, which allow them to travel within Central America. Mexico, however, requires a passport at entry.
Human rights groups have criticised the US and Mexican response to the caravan.
Erika Guevara-Rosas of Amnesty International said in a statement: ""Mexican authorities should not take a Trump approach treating people like a security threat.""
""These families deserve dignity and respect to ensure that no one is illegally returned to situations where they could risk serious harm due to violence.""
Mexican president-elect Andrés Manuel López Obrador plans to offer work visas to Central Americans when he takes office in December.
""It is a plan that we have, that anyone who wants to work in Mexico will have a work visa,"" he said.
Mr Selee told the BBC he thinks Mexico will ""try to defuse the crisis"" the same way they did with the last migrant caravan: by giving some people legal status or the chance to apply for asylum and deporting others.
""The caravan will probably diminish before it reaches the US-Mexico border, but the whole episode will harden views on immigration in the US on both sides and make Mexico more wary about cooperating with the US,"" he says.
An estimated 10% of the population of Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras have fled danger, forced gang recruitment and dismal economic opportunities.
The region has one of the highest murder rates in the world. The UN reported murder rates in 2015 in Honduras standing at 63.75 deaths per 100,000 and El Salvador at 108.64 deaths.
Jari Dixon, an opposition politician in Honduras, tweeted on Monday that the caravan was not ""seeking the American dream"" but ""fleeing the Honduras nightmare"".
In a statement on Tuesday, Honduras' foreign ministry urged its citizens to ""not let themselves be used by a movement that is clearly political and seeks to disrupt the governability, stability and peace"".

The Journeys Festival International features work of refugees and explores their experiences.
Maria Alyokhina is making her theatre debut in Burning Doors, a production by Belarus Free Theatre.
The city will also host pop-up theatre, workshops and giant artworks displayed on buildings during the 12-day event.
Burning Doors explores the persecution of artist Petr Pavlensky, and Maria Alyokhina who was jailed following Pussy Riot's performance in a Moscow cathedral in 2012.
Director of ArtReach David Hill said he hoped the festival ""will be opening eyes, challenging perceptions and raising questions through great art"".
Other festival events include the UK premiere of Sanctuary and Sustenance at Portsmouth Cathedral which involves projections of photography, film and music.
It traces the journey of a family from the catastrophic events that displaced them and through their journey in search of sanctuary.
Look Up is a large-scale outdoor exhibition on the exteriors of buildings featuring the work of Nikos Papadoploulos, whose Plasticobilism series uses Playmobil figures to comment on refugee issues.
The Journeys Festival International runs from 10 to 22 October.
