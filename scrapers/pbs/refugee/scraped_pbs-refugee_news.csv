As of Aug. 31, only 19,899 refugees had been admitted to the U.S.
That’s a dramatic reduction from years past, and next year’s cap has been set even lower.
For more than three decades, the U.S. has taken in more refugees than the rest of the world combined. By the State Department’s estimate, more than 3 million have settled in the country since 1975, as part of a state-sponsored program.
But the Trump administration’s announcement last Monday that it plans to limit the number of refugees admitted to the U.S. next year to just 30,000, down from an already a dramatic reduction, raises questions about America’s role in global refugee resettlement and what the change means for those fleeing violence and poverty around the world.
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a statement that the new resettlement ceiling reflected the U.S.’s “commitment to protect the most vulnerable around the world while prioritizing the safety and well-being of the American people,” adding that the administration intended to continue to “responsibly vet applicants to prevent the entry of those who might do harm to our country.”
But experts say the decision will place added pressure on countries that are already struggling to manage large migrant flows.
While the U.S. has led the world in refugee resettlement for more than three decades, its program was initially born out of foreign policy interests, rather than humanitarian motivation. When the U.S. resettlement program began in the 1980s, “it was really driven by Cold War concerns, and a sense of wanting to provide refuge to people fleeing regimes that the U.S. opposed,” Susan Fratzke of the Migration Policy Institute said. In the years following the fall of Saigon, the U.S. admitted hundreds of thousands of refugees fleeing Vietnam and Indochina—the country welcomed 207,000 in 1980, an all-time high.
By the 1990s, the U.S. refugee program had become more humanitarian-focused, but continued to lead the rest of the world in resettlement. The program’s focus on self-sufficiency — refugees are expected to find work and support themselves as quickly as possible upon their arrival to the U.S. — is part of the reason that the American government has been able to take in more refugees than any other country over the past three decades. Other top resettlement countries with comparable systems offer more robust aid programs to refugees, according to Fratzke, and cannot necessarily afford to take in tens of thousands more.
The U.S. works, in partnership with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees as well as other governmental and non-governmental agencies, to resettle refugees that have fled their home countries due to fear of violence or persecution. The cases referred to the U.S. are the most extreme — while the UNHCR estimates that 8 percent of the global refugee population are eligible to be resettled, less than 1 percent ever are. The process that refugees go through to enter the U.S. is different than that of asylum-seekers — whereas refugees have already fled their home countries and are submitted for resettlement through the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program, asylum-seekers go through U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. In 2016, just 11,729 immigrants were granted asylum by the USCIS.
Once the U.S. receives refugee cases from these agencies, the government conducts its own review of these individuals and decides whether or not to admit them. This process can take up to two years, and generally includes five background checks and three in-person interviews, with evaluations by eight different government agencies.
In reviewing these cases, the U.S. generally gives highest priority to refugees who are deemed to be in most urgent need of resettlement — these include persons facing serious security concerns in the original country from where they fled, victims of violence, as well as individuals who have faced persecution due to their political or religious activities. Other groups of refugees are given priority by the State Department due to special humanitarian concerns or interest in family reunification. Groups given special consideration for resettlement by the U.S. include those fleeing Cuba, as well as Iraqis who have worked for the U.S. in some capacity.
Should a refugee be accepted for resettlement by the State Department, their case is referred to one of nine private resettlement agencies that work with the U.S. government.
Once refugees arrive to the U.S., they receive support from these agencies and their affiliates, which provide basic needs such as food, clothing, housing and job assistance to these individuals during their first months of arrival. Under the government’s Office of Refugee Resettlement, refugees receive cash assistance for up to eight months. After this point, the expectation is that they achieve economic self-sufficiency, meaning they earn enough to support a family without assistance from the government.
During the last year that President Obama was in office, the refugee cap was set at 110,000 for fiscal year 2017. Arrivals declined significantly after President Trump was elected, and only 53,716 refugees were resettled in the U.S. during this period despite the higher quota, according to a database maintained by the State Department.
The president signed an executive order days after taking office that took direct aim at the resettlement program, barring Syrian refugees from entering the country indefinitely and restricting immigrants from seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the U.S. for 90 days. While the first ban was overturned by the courts, it had a major effect on the flow of refugees entering the country during this period, and a revised order was upheld by the Supreme Court. The Trump administration has pushed for “extreme vetting” of immigrants seeking to enter the country and rejected a Department of Health and Human Services study in the fall of that year that showed refugees had a positive economic outcome on the U.S. overall.
During a public appearance last June, the president said “the U.S. will not be a migrant camp, and it will not be a refugee holding facility.” The new 30,000 cap echos that statement.
The U.S. decision puts added pressure on countries already overwhelmed by the migrant crisis, but the drop in refugee resettlement is not just a U.S. trend. The overall global number of refugee resettlement places was down by 54 percent in 2017, with only 75,200 available spots, according to the UNHCR. The year before, the number of resettlement places made available by host countries was at 163,200, the highest in 20 years. While the UNHCR estimated that 1.2 million refugees were eligible for resettlement in 2017, the agency submitted just 102,800 cases to host countries.
“We’re disappointed to see global refugee numbers reduced, including in the United States,” says Gary Seidman, a spokesperson for the UN High Commissioner on Refugees.
Since President Trump took office in January of 2017, some 30,000 migrants have crossed the Canadian border from the U.S. with hopes that they’ll have a better shot at staying in Canada. The influx of asylum-seekers has prompted some in the Canadian government to question the country’s Safe Third Country agreement with the U.S., which for years mandated that migrants arriving on either side of the border apply for asylum in the first country they arrived.
In dealing with high numbers of asylum-seekers fleeing violence in Africa and the Middle East, Europe’s share spiked to 57 percent in 2017, after taking in 9 to 13 percent of resettlement cases referred by the UNHCR in previous years, in large part due to the significant drop on the U.S. side. At the same time, a resurgence of anti-immigrant sentiment, driven by the rise of far-right political parties throughout the continent, has stoked anxiety in countries such as Germany, where Chancellor Angela Merkel faced politically perilous backlash for her commitment to welcoming one million refugees starting in 2015.
With such a major shift in refugee policy, will other countries step up to become leaders in resettlement? It’s unlikely that any will take in refugees at the volume that America once did because no other resettlement program is quite like the one in the U.S.
Even during a year when resettlement policy shifted dramatically, UNHCR numbers indicate that the U.S. still topped the list of resettlement countries in 2017: it resettled 24,599 individuals referred by the UN agency; more than Canada at 8,912, and the UK, which took in 6,202.
“No one is going to be able to fill the gap left by the U.S.,” says Fratzke. “No country is going to come in and fill those 50,000 places.”
None of this will lessen the flow of immigrants fleeing distress in countries such as Syria, the Democratic Republic of Congo, or Myanmar, which is why Anthony Messina, a political science professor specializing in European migration at Trinity College, envisions the global migrant situation becoming even tighter in the coming years: “One has to sort of think of this as a container or bottle that is filling up,” he says. “Even if they fall for a couple of years, it doesn’t mean that those that aspired to get to Europe or North America have gone away.”"

The announcement comes despite calls from global humanitarian groups that this year’s cap of 45,000 was too low.
The 30,000 ceiling announced Monday by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is the maximum the U.S. will admit during the fiscal year that starts Oct. 1. The actual number allowed could be lower. The U.S. welcomed nearly 85,000 refugees in the final year of the Obama administration.
The lower admittance numbers reflect the Trump administration’s opposition to accepting refugees and other immigrants into the U.S. That approach has already driven down refugee admissions to their lowest level in a decade.

Rohingya refugees described burned villages, rape and beatings at the hands of soldiers in Myanmar’s Rakhine state in what the U.N. has characterized as “acts of genocide.” The army has denied the accusations.
Today, the 700,000 Rohingya refugees are living in bamboo and tarp-covered shelters in sprawling camps near Cox’s Bazar in southern Bangladesh. Most — about 600,000 — live in the Kutupalong-Balukhali extension camp, known as the “mega camp.”
The refugees said they feel much safer in the camps but yearn for justice and a state to call their own.
“They can actually sleep through the night, and their kids don’t have to listen to bullets whizzing by,” said Caryl Stern, president and CEO of UNICEF USA, who recently visited the camps.

The number of new arrivals has fallen significantly since the start of the crisis, when around 500,000 people arrived in just a few weeks, but Rohingya are still entering the camps in need of humanitarian assistance, said the International Organization for Migration’s Fiona MacGregor, who is based in Cox’s Bazar.
Here’s what we know about the status of Rohingya refugees and what’s next.
The International Organization for Migration is working with other U.N. agencies to distribute liquefied petroleum gas stoves to refugees, who have been stripping nearby forests for firewood to do their cooking. The agencies plan to hand out 200,000 stoves and gas cylinders to cover almost every refugee household, MacGregor said. They plan to provide another 47,000 stoves and cylinders to the local community as well, she added.
Doctors Without Borders, which runs 19 health facilities and mobile clinics among the camps, said the medical needs of the refugees are changing. “At first, more than half of [the] patients were treated for violence-related injuries, but other health concerns soon emerged, linked to the overcrowded and unhygienic conditions in the camps,” which are worsened by monsoon rains, the group reported.
The World Health Organization, working with the Bangladesh government and local health groups, set up 155 “health posts” over the past year and provided vaccinations to protect against diseases such as cholera, measles and diphtheria.

With basic medical, food and water needs addressed, the refugees are expressing a desire for other long-term services, like higher education. UNICEf and its local partners operate than 1,000 primary-level learning centers in the camps that teach basic reading and writing in English and history. But the refugees told them they also would like secondary-level classes that offer career training, such as computers and coding, UNICEF’s Stern said.
“They’re concerned with what’s going to happen to their children. What happens if they’re here for a long time? Will they ever be skilled and prepared to take on a life of their own? Those are their really big concerns,” she said.
Rohingya refugee leaders, the government of Bangladesh and the U.N. all say that the refugees must be able to return home to Myanmar if they wish, MacGregor said. “However, they must be able to do so in a voluntary, safe, dignified and sustainable manner and it is evident conditions are not in place for that to happen.”
In May, the Myanmar government announced an agreement with the United Nations to allow the Rohingya to return. But the refugees are concerned they still won’t be safe, and the U.N. cautioned that citizenship rights and an end to violence must be established first.
Pavlo Kolovos, Doctors Without Borders’ head of mission in Bangladesh, said the reality is that hundreds of thousands of Rohingya have been displaced in Bangladesh and elsewhere for decades, “and it may be decades until they can safely return to Myanmar, if ever.”

The United Nations also documented an increase in child brides among Rohingya girls who enter other countries, including Indonesia and Malaysia. Advocates worry that displacement makes women and girls more vulnerable to human trafficking.
Stern said when she asked female refugees what they most needed, many told her the same thing: “I need to not be stateless. I need an identity. I need to know I have a home, a place where I belong.” And when she asked what they wanted: “I want justice. That’s all they kept saying, ‘I want justice.’ As someone who’s so used to being able to supply wants and needs, those were two really hard ones for me.”

The calls to the faithful came early in the camps and people streamed into the makeshift mosques, the children in freshly washed clothes.
The four-day holiday of Eid al-Adha celebrates the Prophet Ibrahim and his willingness to sacrifice his son. Muslims often slaughter sheep, cattle or goats on the holiday, distributing some meat to the poor. But few in the camps could afford such luxuries this year.
The Muslim Rohingyas have faced generations of discrimination in largely Buddhist Myanmar, denied citizenship rights, attacked in pogroms and sometimes not able to practice their faith openly.

“We could not pray during Eid in my village for years, we had to pray secretly,” said refugee Nurul Alam. “I have freedom here, but I don’t want it here.”
“We don’t belong here,” he continued. “It’s good that nobody is coming to kill us, but I want to go back where my parents’ graves are located.”
More than 700,000 Rohingya poured into Bangladesh last year fleeing a scorched-earth campaign by the Myanmar military and Buddhist mobs after attacks by a Rohingya insurgent group. Thousands of people are believed to have been killed in the crackdown, which many rights activists believe was a calculated attempt to drive Rohingya from the country.
Many in Myanmar see the Rohingya as illegal migrants from Bangladesh, deriding them as “Bengalis.” Most have long lived in poverty in Myanmar’s Rakhine state, next to Bangladesh.
The events of the past year have made for a poignant Eid al-Adha.
“We are happy, but again we are not happy, said 60-year-old Shamsul Alam as he walked to a mosque for prayers. “I had my land, I had a grocery shop there, I had rice, potatoes to eat there. Here I don’t have any problem for food, but I don’t have what I need.”
“I am nobody here,” he said."

Rohingya refugee teen juggles competing demands,"CHICAGO — On a cold, gray Saturday morning last winter, Salamat Khan Bin Jalil Khan sat behind the wheel of his battered 1995 Honda Civic and warmed up the sputtering engine for his 22-mile trip to work.
The 19-year-old refugee from Myanmar had been awake for hours helping his sister with chores, including an early morning run to the laundromat. Now, he faced a 10-hour shift at a fast-food restaurant in a suburban strip mall, grilling chicken and dousing it in a spicy Piri-Piri sauce. He could use the time to prepare for final exams at Roger C. Sullivan High School, but family and work obligations — not to mention sheer exhaustion — once again interfered.
The tired young man had traveled more than 8,000 miles to find himself on this stretch of Illinois highway. Along the way, Salamat, a member of Myanmar’s Rohingya Muslim community, had watched neighbors’ homes being burned to the ground and fled his homeland in a crammed truck — all while trying to complete an education that has always felt just out of reach.
Between the ages of 14 and 18, he missed nearly four years of schooling while his family lived in Malaysia. Even after arriving two years ago in Chicago — where about 1,300 Rohingya refugees now live — Salamat missed crucial months of school so that he can help support his family, including sending money to his parents in Myanmar. “I have to start a new life in America, but I also have to support my parents,” Salamat says. “There’s just so much on my shoulders.”
Salamat faces a pressure that’s common to older teenage male immigrant students, who frequently drop out of school to work full time. “It doesn’t faze these students but it breaks our hearts,” says Sarah Quintenz, who heads the English language learners program at Sullivan High. This is particularly true for Burmese refugees who struggle more than other immigrant groups with mastering English and complete bachelor’s degrees at lower rates, according to a 2017 report from the Migration Policy Institute.
Nationwide, graduation rates for students with limited English skills — considered a proxy for immigrant and refugee students — are far lower than for native English speakers: 67 percent compared to a national average of 84 percent. Salamat’s story — one defined by financial hardship, familial obligation and a lack of school support — offers an important glimpse at why.
Grateful for the safety and opportunities of his new country, Salamat dreams of going to college. He also dreams of bringing his parents to Chicago. But for the time being, it often feels like those two goals compete, forcing him to make a heart-wrenching choice: Support his family. Or go to school.
Salamat was born in a small farming village that his family knows as Aung Tine, located in Myanmar’s impoverished Rakhine State on the western coast of the country. His father’s family had tended rice paddies there for generations. At the age of 5, Salamat traveled to Yangon, the country’s largest city, where he lived with an aunt and attended a higher-quality public school.
“My parents cannot read or write beautifully, but they know the value of education,” Salamat says.

His life in Yangon was quiet and productive. Salamat became fluent in Burmese. Most older Rohingya Muslims solely speak Rohingya, an oral language that lacks a standardized written script. On weekdays “it was only about study, study, study,” Salamat recalls. “Saturday, Sunday, I go hang out with my friends.”
Usually, Salamat’s visits home to Aung Tine were restful breaks. But late in the spring of 2012, the 13-year-old arrived to find a village transformed by fear.
Longstanding disputes between Buddhists and Rohingya Muslims in Rakhine had resurfaced, bringing an eruption of violence, including the torching of thousands of homes. In Aung Tine, families forbid their children from playing outdoors. Most adults stopped venturing to the river to fish.
The violence intensified over the summer. Buddhist mobs tossed flaming torches into houses on the fringes of the village, Salamat recalls. He often joined in efforts to quell the flames, and also served as a messenger — sprinting through the village to instruct his neighbors to stay home when the elders suspected an attack. The villagers believed that the military, which had taken control of parts of the region, played a role in supporting attacks on the Rohingya.
By July, the family decided it was time for their two sons to leave. The parents would remain in Aung Tine.
The boys’ destination would be neighboring Malaysia, where Salamat’s sister, Gulshar, had already moved, and lived with her husband and two children. They were part of a mass exodus of Rohingya from Myanmar that summer totaling an estimated 125,000 people. Salamat recalls little about the 900-mile trek apart from the mountains and stretches where they had to get out of cramped truck and walk. “I didn’t know what direction I was going. I just knew that I was going to my sister.”
In Malaysia, the brothers crowded into their sister’s family’s small apartment. Malaysia is not a signatory to the 1951 U.N. Refugee Convention, which requires countries to allow refugee children to enroll in school. As an “illegal immigrant,” Salamat could not register for school. He earned a meager living doing electrical work.
At the end of 2015, Salamat’s brother-in-law received word that the United States had agreed to admit his family as refugees. Seventeen at the time, Salamat qualified as a dependent.
In January, they flew to Chicago. Salamat was most excited to resume his education. “I thought I would wake up every morning, get a cup of coffee, go to school,” he said.
In Rogers Park, Salamat moved into a dingy one-bedroom apartment with his sister, brother-in-law, and their now three children. They lived off West Devon Avenue in an area bustling with immigrant families, including many Rohingya.
Salamat’s brother-in-law found work cleaning airplanes at the airport. And in February 2016, the teen enrolled at Mather High School on the city’s north side, which has a large immigrant population.
In his first days, Salamat took a test assessing his English proficiency. He scored just 1.9 on a 6-point scale. That meant that he would start Mather as a 17-year-old freshman, taking beginner English as a second language (ESL) classes.
Salamat felt disoriented — and not just when it came to language. In Myanmar, students stayed in the same room all day; the teachers came to them. At Mather, Salamat carried a printed floor plan of the building with him at all times. Still, he kept getting lost. “I didn’t even know the bell ring sound,” he said.
After only six months, Salamat dropped out. His brother-in-law was stretched thin supporting the Chicago household. Meanwhile, Salamat’s parents had moved to Yangon to escape the violence of Rakhine. They desperately needed help with moving costs and rent.

“I was like, ‘I have to work. I have to earn money,’” he says. Approaching 18 years old at the time, Salamat had yet to complete his freshman year.
His decision is disturbingly common for older teenage refugee students — particularly young men from Myanmar. “The older the student grows, the more pressure there is to work,” says Abdul Jabbar, a Rohingya refugee and caseworker at Chicago’s Pan-African Association, a resettlement agency.
Jabbar and others say there are several reasons for the high drop-out rates, some cultural and others structural: many Rohingya come from villages where formal schooling ends early; schools lack sufficient mentors for this group; and older teen males sometimes face peer pressure to start their own families.
“Rohingya young men who are 17 or 18 often think of themselves as men, not teens who should be in school,” said Laura Toffenetti, assistant director of Chicago’s Rohingya Culture Center. “Planning for the future gets sidetracked by trying to survive the present.”
Indeed, the biggest reason is money. Rohingya women typically do not work outside the home and older relatives sometimes remain behind in Myanmar. This means that from the moment they land on American soil, men in refugee families start scrambling for jobs.
The country’s resettlement program, which has been cut significantly under President Donald Trump, has in recent decades prioritized refugee employment. The focus on quick employment comes at a cost, according to the authors of the 2017 Migration Policy Institute report. There’s not nearly as much financial and programmatic support for refugees who want to return to school or hone job skills, possibly resulting in “brain waste,” they write.
The Refugee Act of 1980 defines “success” largely in terms of employment metrics, not civic engagement or non-economic measures of integration. The federal government spends at least four times as much money on job training and support for refugees as it does on educational assistance, according to a 2015 report from the Office of Refugee Resettlement.
The length of cash assistance for refugee families has also plummeted in recent decades. Prior to the 1990s, the federal government provided up to three years of social welfare benefits created specifically for the refugee population. Now, that’s capped at eight months. Refugees still receive one-time grants when they arrive in the U.S. — which have increased over the last decade. But, at just over $1,100 per person, the money only subsidizes the cost of living for a month or two in cities with high living expenses, like Chicago.
“There’s no financial safety net,” says Anne Saw, an assistant professor of psychology at DePaul University who studies Asian-American immigrant communities. “Often, the entirety of the single paycheck coming in the family goes toward rent.”
By contrast, refugees in Canada receive an initial cash grant that’s larger than the U.S. amount (a family of five would get upwards of $6,000). They then can receive monthly income assistance — on top of any social welfare benefits — for up to a year.
Salamat and his sister’s family received a little over $5,500 shortly after arriving in the U.S. ($1,125 per person). They spent about half of that on a security deposit and the first two months’ rent, says Ephraim Assefa, a former caseworker at the Ethiopian Community Association of Chicago who helped the family settle. It then took Salamat’s brother-in-law more than three months to find even a low-paying job at the airport.
After dropping out, Salamat also went to work full-time at O’Hare International Airport, a popular employment hub for Chicago’s Rohingya men. His daily commute, by bus and then train, took two hours each way. At first, he worked late night shifts cleaning airplanes — hustling to vacuum aisles and clearing seat pockets of garbage. “My body always felt down,” he says. Most of his co-workers didn’t speak English, giving him little opportunity to practice.
By the summer of 2017, Salamat had switched to a less physically taxing job at an airline lounge. But he worried that unless he went back to school, waiting tables might be the best work he would ever find. His sister, like his parents, values education and understood his desire to finish high school. Gulshar says she worked hard for good grades even though, unlike her brothers, she did not get sent away to study. “I don’t know a lot of English,” she says, with Salamat translating. “But I am very good at math.”
So at the age of 19, Salamat decided to re-enroll in school. With some help from a 77-year-old former volunteer at the Ethiopian Community Association, he found Sullivan High, where about 40 percent of students are English-language learners. Several of his friends already attended Sullivan. Salamat continued to work weekends so that he could keep sending money to his parents.
He felt convinced that if he worked virtually nonstop, he would be able to get it all done.
On a Monday morning last winter, Salamat was the first to arrive in his “Modern Band” class at Sullivan. He walked into the amphitheater-shaped classroom, its blue walls decorated with vinyl records, and grabbed a guitar from the instrument closet; he strummed and hummed happily as classmates trickled in. Learning to play guitar is one of the joys of his return to student life.
Salamat’s warm-up ended when his music teacher announced the class would work in pairs to write musical compositions. Salamat raised his hand: “Can I be a soloist? Can I make my own song?”
“I’m sorry, I can’t make that exception, Sal,” she told him.
His resistance to team up is not unusual for young adult refugee students, says Quintenz, who heads Sullivan’s ESL program.
“The students who are mentally and physically older…the ones who know about being an adult — about being tired, about being broke, about paying bills — those are the students who tend to keep to themselves,” Quintenz said.
Although Sullivan has made strides toward better serving immigrant students, it still lacks two things that could most help Salamat: flexible scheduling (students are required to be on campus from 8 a.m. to 3 pm.) and staff who speak his language.
Schools and districts large and small have struggled to recruit staff members from new or growing immigrant communities, including Myanmar and Bangladesh.
Sullivan enrolls about 30 students whose families speak primarily Burmese or Rohingya at home. (Another 13 students report speaking Malay, also common among Rohingya refugees.) Although staff speak 12 languages between them, including Korean, Arabic, and Hindi, no one speaks Burmese, Rohingya or Malay.
Finding educators who speak both Burmese and English well is a huge challenge. Mather, which Salamat attended before Sullivan, enrolls over 20 Burmese speakers (one of 68 different languages spoken by students), according to Elena Indman, chair of the ESL department. Last year, the school pushed hard to find a Burmese-speaking teacher, reaching out to local universities for recommendations. “We got nobody,” Indman said.
Sharing a common language not only facilitates communication with families, it also provides students with natural mentors. “The Rohingya here need more role models when it comes to education,” says Saw. She adds that many older Rohingya parents didn’t finish primary school in Myanmar.
It’s not a coincidence that Salamat has forged the closest relationship at Sullivan with Habeeba Fatima, his math teacher and an Indian immigrant. “Being an immigrant is a plus point for me,” Fatima says. “Students see that connection.”

Fatima knows more details about Salamat’s life outside school than other teachers, including that he worries constantly about whether his parents receive the money he sends.
With no Rohingya or Burmese speaker on staff, Sullivan has created a “student ambassador program” where student leaders from different immigrant communities help orient newly arrived refugees: showing them where to purchase school uniforms, for instance.
Last year, CPS awarded the school $300,000 in funding to hire four ESL teachers and a dedicated social worker. “We know what a good support system looks like for these students,” said Matthew Fasana, an assistant principal. “But there’s always been a funding dilemma.”
A few schools across the country have experimented with longer hours for older immigrant teens. Those include Houston’s Liberty High School, where evening classes stretch until 10 p.m. “Many of our students who are new to the country…are responsible for themselves but also for families back home,” says Principal Monico Rivas.
In Chicago, Salamat’s best bet for more flexible scheduling would be to enroll in a largely online program, where he would forgo considerable teacher support. His grades have dipped in recent months (he declined to share specifics). And it’s tough for him to imagine how he could be successful with less teacher assistance.
Salamat recently quit his job at the suburban fast-food restaurant to make it easier to focus on school. He plans to start his junior year at Sullivan in the fall (he turns 20 in August). Yet he feels that he needs to earn at least some money, and scrambled in June to line up job possibilities closer to home.
He relies on his faith to help him push through long, grueling days. The streets of West Devon Avenue bustle with storefronts selling Indian and Pakistani food, boutiques, salons and faith-based community centers.
Salamat started attending one center, the “Islamic Oasis,” soon after he arrived. Many late afternoons find him there. One day, Salamat arrived at the Oasis wearing a sky blue t-shirt that read: “Where Will Your Journey Lead?” He took off his shoes, washed his hands and face and quickly prayed. For the next couple of hours, he shuffled between small groups of boys, helping them fill out worksheets with questions about the solar system and algebra, his typically solemn demeanor disappearing for occasional giggles.
Salamat wants to serve as a role model for younger immigrants. And he knows that to do that well, he should focus on his education. He’s committed to graduating high school by 2020, when he will turn 22, and dreams of becoming a teacher someday. But his parents also tug deeply at his heart. “My parents are very old. I don’t want them to work again,” he says. “I want them to be safe and support them as much as I can.” When he is eligible for citizenship after five years in the U.S., Salamat hopes to bring them to Chicago.
For now, Salamat doesn’t dare count on any education post-Sullivan High.
“If tomorrow I tell my parents, ‘I cannot send money and I have to go to college,’ they will let me go,” Salamat says. “But in my heart, I know they need help.”
“Everyone has a dream to come to America,” he adds. “But want to say it is not easy. It is not easy at all.”

Timmy Kinner is accused of stabbing a group of children and the adults who tried to protect them at the party at an apartment complex that is home to many refugee families.
Word of the child’s death came at Kinner’s first court appearance, where Ada County Magistrate Judge Russell Comstock told him that he was charged with first-degree murder and other felonies in connection with the Saturday night attack.
Comstock told Kinner he was “an extreme danger to the community” and ordered him held without bond.
Kinner is American, and the victims are members of refugee families from Syria, Iraq and Ethiopia. Boise Police Chief William Bones said the evidence does not suggest the attack was a hate crime.
The suspect had recently stayed at the apartment complex but was asked to leave Friday over bad behavior, Bones said.
The 30-year-old appeared in court through closed-circuit video, a common practice for first appearances in Idaho. Wearing a tattered off-white sweatshirt with his arms shackled to his waist, Kinner told the judge he didn’t understand the charges or proceedings. He also said he wanted to represent himself.
The judge ordered that he be appointed a public defender anyway.
“I can’t explain the charges any more clearly than I just did,” he told Kinner.
Three of the stabbing victims were adults, the others children: the 3-year-old girl who died, two 4-year-olds, a 6-year-old, an 8-year-old and a 12-year-old.
If convicted, Kinner could be eligible for execution under Idaho law. Ada County Prosecutor Jan Bennetts said her office has not yet decided whether to seek the death penalty, saying those “high-level decisions” are made only after all the facts are in."

A Syrian now living in Jordan, Alshraidab’s education was cut short when she got married. After her husband’s abuse became too much to bear, she got a divorce and became a single parent of two.
She fled with her children when the fighting in Syria worsened in 2012. When she arrived in Jordan, “I felt broken and weak,” she said recently through an interpreter. After finding her footing, she became an activist within her refugee community and is now part of a team of volunteers educating women and girls about their rights.
“I advise every girl not to get married at an early age, get a decent degree and live your life, don’t let your feelings lead you and trust no one until you know him very well. Your degree will make you stronger and more mature to decide who to spend your life with,” she said.

For many Syrian refugees, their troubles don’t end when they reach a safer destination. With little of their own resources, some refugee families marry off their girls to try to give them more financial security and a chance at a better life. According to Jordanian courts, child brides among Syrians living in Jordan increased from 15 percent in 2014 to 36 percent in 2018.
Cash-strapped refugee families often opt for “negative coping mechanisms,” including child marriage and child labor, said UNICEF’s chief of child protection Maha Homsi, based in Amman. The families also believe that by marrying girls off early, the husbands will become their protectors in a foreign land, she said.
Among some Syrian refugees coming to Jordan was a mindset that by marrying a Jordanian, the girl would gain social status and her family will be able to leave the refugee camp, Homsi said. “And some (parents) don’t feel like there is a future in education.”
At the refugee camps, aid organizations provide an education for children up to the secondary school level, but there is little opportunity for girls to continue their education at universities — unless they can pay for it — or to get employment, she said.
The message should not focus on only child marriage but on gender-based violence as a whole, said community volunteer Hala Shalabalsham (left). Fatima Hilal (right) said in Syria, women barely knew about their rights, so now she is spreading the word. Photo by Larisa Epatko/PBS NewsHour
Child marriage is a common practice in Syria, said Fatima Hilal, another volunteer who coaches refugee women and girls about their rights through aid organization CARE’s Women Leadership Councils. Some Syrian girls marry as young as 14 and then usually drop out of school to take care of the household.
The practice carries over when Syrian refugees come to Jordan. Although 18 is the legal age to marry in Jordan, the law allows for some exemptions. If refugees do wed at a younger age, they might not register their marriage at the courthouse, which makes it difficult to pursue legal justice if the girls are abused or encounter other problems, said Homsi.
To discourage families from marrying off their girls at a young age, community volunteers like Alshraidab and Hilal will meet at one of the houses of a family where they have identified a need. All the host has to do is provide tea, Alshraidab said.
The activists sing songs to make the meeting feel more informal, and give the families a more realistic portrayal of early marriage, including the downsides. They tell the girls about the financial dependency and that many early marriages end up in divorce, Hilal said.
The activists tell the families about women who did not marry at a young age and pursued an education, and now are “successful and strong,” she said. The message is more authentic coming from local women rather than someone from an aid group, who might not be connected with the community, she added.
The volunteers also provide information about cash assistance and other programs that could help the families.
Sometimes their message works, and sometimes it doesn’t, but at least it gets the community talking, the volunteers said. In Syria, women were not always aware of their rights, said Hilal. Now, she and others like her are the mouthpiece for change."

He was hit by shrapnel when his hometown Daraa came under siege and his leg had to be amputated.
A year later, al Hari, his wife Asmaa and their children escaped successfully, bringing only the clothes on their backs across the desert terrain. They met a Bedouin family, who took them in for the night, gave them a meal and drove them to the Jordanian border.
They crossed into Jordan and settled in the rural community of Azraq, about 60 miles east of Amman, a town of 60,000 with a growing Syrian population.
“Even if there’s war, but my village is safe, I would go back” to Syria, said Mohammed al Hari (right) with his wife Asmaa and three of their daughters, (from left) Walaa, 15, Safaa, 17, and Ayatalruhman, 7. Photo by Larisa Epatko/PBS NewsHour
Today, al Hari helps manage a coffee shop. His 13-year-old son Nasr al Deen does what his father’s legs can’t. When someone pulls up in a car and shouts his coffee order, Naser runs it out.
“I couldn’t work without him,” al Hari says.
Since the war began, Jordan has taken in about 666,100 Syrian refugees, but the Jordanian government estimates the number is actually double, including those who have not registered with the U.N. refugee agency. The U.N. Global Trends report released Tuesday says Syria is still the source of most refugees. Syrians account for 6.3 million of the total 68.5 million refugees who have been displaced from their homes as of the end of 2017.

Near the town of Azraq, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees operates a refugee camp that goes by the same name, home to 50,000 Syrians who made journeys like al Hari’s. Rows of white corrugated metal huts are partitioned into villages and powered by solar panels. The camp has helped accommodate the overflow of migrants from the Zaatari camp, which is closer to the Syrian border and now houses about 83,000 refugees.
The influx of Syrians has increased tensions over jobs. The Syrians are willing to work for lower wages, said Nouf Fayez, who runs the international nonprofit CARE’s community center in the town of Azraq, which means they are more likely to find employment. That’s frustrated Jordanians, who feel they are being passed over for work. In response, nongovernmental organizations like CARE include both Jordanians and Syrians in their aid programs, such as providing vocational training to start home businesses like cooking and sewing.
To accommodate the growing Syrian youth population in Azraq, the Jordanian government runs the school day in shifts. Jordanians go to school in the morning, and Syrians attend for two hours in the afternoon.

Different organizations, including Mercy Corps, Save the Children and CARE, help provide services and run community centers in Azraq camp. That’s how 13-year-old Rayan learned taekwondo with her younger sister, Zainab.
“The hardest part about being in the camp is the shock of seeing the desert,” Rayan said through an interpreter. “It’s been such a long time since I’ve seen a flower. In Syria, it’s so green and there are flowers everywhere.”
Still, Zainab said she and her sister get to learn new things, like taekwondo. The girls’ brother, who enrolled in the classes first, convinced their mother to let the girls learn, too, Rayan said. His reasoning: “If another war breaks out, they have to defend themselves.”

The girls demonstrate what they’ve learned by breaking a plywood board in half with a powerful kick.
Another member of the taekwondo team is Wael, 16, who came to the camp at age 12 from the Syrian city of Homs. He earned his black belt in the sport and aspires to compete on the refugee team in the 2020 Olympics.
“I want to meet other champions and be just like them,” he said through an interpreter. “The biggest loss was the loss of my country, but everything else I’m working to get back.”"

We occasionally hear about brutal deaths and starvation of civilians in Syria from the news, as a far concept happening in another world. This is a group of people who may justifiably feel betrayed by the world.
But what do we know about those who made it to the U.S. before the travel ban? How hard were they hit by the horrifying experience of war, torture and living in refugee camps? And how are they coping with years of exposure to trauma and stress prior to arrival in the U.S. and the stress of migration?
Our research team, Stress, Trauma, and Anxiety Research Clinic STARC at Wayne State University, has been exploring the psychological impact of traumatic experiences in Syrian adult and children refugees. We believe our findings underscore the need for immediate attention to the mental health of this population.
Their experience before landing in the US
Before the civil war, Syria was a relatively stable country. In a short period, Syrian civilians found themselves in the chaos of a very confusing disaster. Access to food, water and medical care became extremely limited, and people survived – and still do – day by day.
It is hard to know which group is fighting which, and what they want from civilians within their momentary territory. Children and adults are often exposed to explosions, direct threat of death, sight or news of death, mutilation, or torture of their loved ones.
Those who had enough resources to leave, and the luck of surviving the flight, ended up in refugee camps in Turkey, Greece or other nearby countries. There, they often lived in terrible conditions for a couple of years, having left their dead or living family members and belongings in Syria.
A very small group, who have gone through a detailed vetting, have ended up in European countries, and a much lower number have in the U.S. (less than 0.5 percent). Those who end up in the U.S. have been in a camp for about a couple of years. So, despite what some may believe, getting a refugee status in the U.S. was not easy before the travel ban.
What is post-traumatic stress disorder?
Post traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD, is a consequence of exposure to extreme traumatic experiences such as combat, torture, assault, rape, robbery or serious motor vehicle accidents. Such experiences switch the brain to “survival mode,” attempting to avoid re-traumatization. Symptoms include high anxiety, avoiding reminders of trauma (sights, sounds, smells, memories), emotional numbness, hyper-vigilance, frequent intrusive memories of the traumatic experience, nightmares and flashbacks.
PTSD is often accompanied by depression, which by itself is one of the most debilitating medical conditions. One could imagine how hard it is for a person with the above symptoms, to venture out and explore the new environment, which is an important behavior needed for successful assimilation.
What do we know about their mental health?
Focus of resettlement of Syrian refugees has been on immediate minimum housing and financial and physical health care needs. Mental health, which requires greater language and cultural familiarity, has typically not been a priority before and after arrival in the U.S.

Our bilingual team at STARC, many of whom are refugee doctors, took the challenge of screening Syrian and Iraqi refugees for common consequences of exposure to extreme traumatic experiences and stress of migration. Screening happened within the first month of arrival in the U.S., after a mandatory physical health screening.
Our findings are alarming: 1 in 3 men and women screen positive for PTSD (similar to the lifetime prevalence in Vietnam War veterans), nearly half show a high level of depression, and half exhibit high anxiety. Half of children show high anxiety. Nearly 80 percent separation anxiety in children restricts their ability to go to school and explore their new world. The number one concern expressed by teachers is their difficulty attending school because of high separation anxiety. This is especially critical because cumulative research shows serious negative effects of untreated childhood trauma on mental and physical health in adulthood.
What are we doing for them?
The situation of refugees is complicated by chronic stress of migration, lack of resources, and difficulty navigating the complicated U.S. medical system.
PTSD, and other consequences of trauma, are treatable, and we have effective methods of addressing them. However, access is limited by lack of providers skilled in treatment of trauma who are fluent in culture and language. That has led to efforts in using creative methods of addressing trauma and stress in refugees.

Despite the unwelcoming attitude of the current administration toward Muslim refugees, the state of Michigan has been more hospitable, providing support for a few projects addressing trauma in refugees. Our group has focused on less costly, more easily disseminated methods of addressing stress, specifically for children.
With support from the state and a few foundations, and in collaboration with the community, we provide mindful yoga to mothers and art, dance and movement therapy for children in a culturally familiar context, with a focus on emotional stress. Our pilot data shows feasibility, participation by refugees and community building. These interventions have led to reduction in symptoms of stress, especially separation anxiety symptoms.
One of our most touching experiences was when we learned that a Holocaust survivor wants to donate to our research. “I identified with them and I identified with the children. My heart was breaking for these people, so it brought back memories. I was a refugee child,” the person told us.
Bottom line
Migration has always happened for happy or sad reasons, and it will continue. We can do a lot to protect the refugee families, and those children who will be future American adults, against the profound lifelong negative impact of trauma, depression and forced migration. These measures can assure a productive, functional and well-assimilated future for them. We as citizens may have to take charge and make that decision, before it is too late.

But Trump did not mention the kinds of students Mandy Manning teaches during a White House ceremony held to honor her and other winners. Manning teaches English to new refugee and immigrant students at the Newcomer Center at Joel E. Ferris High School in Spokane.
“Teachers like Mandy play a vital role in the well-being of our children, the strength of our communities and the success of our nation,” Trump said. “The job of a teacher is not only to instruct the next generation of workers but the next generations of citizens to teach our children to care for others, to think for themselves, to love their country, to be proud of our history and to be true pillars of their families and their communities.”
The word “citizens” was written in all-caps in the president’s prepared remarks while the other words were lowercased. The remarks were projected on three teleprompters in the room for him to read.
Trump has taken a hard-line approach to both legal and illegal immigration and for a period suspended the U.S. refugee program. During his Republican campaign for president, he compared refugees fleeing war-torn Syria to a Trojan horse carrying would-be terrorists, and he proposed banning Muslims from entering the country.
The National Teacher of the Year Program began in 1952 and describes itself as the “oldest, most prestigious national honors program that focuses public attention on excellence in teaching.”
Every president since Harry Truman has honored its winners in a White House ceremony.
At the Newcomer Center where Manning teaches, students spend five hours a day working to set up a base of academic knowledge so that the teens can ultimately join their peers in general education classes. Manning also helps them adjust to American culture — from navigating the cafeteria and reading body language to understanding classroom etiquette, like taking turns when speaking.
Manning’s students come from all over the world, many escaping chaotic, conflict-torn homelands across the Middle East, Africa, Asia and the Americas.
But while she had a record 33 students in the fall of 2016, she’s now working with just five.
It’s a correlation Manning can’t ignore — that there has been such a drop in the number of refugees and immigrants landing in eastern Washington coinciding with the Trump administration’s tightening immigration policies.
Fewer refugee families mean the children just feel more isolated in their new world, she had said."

Patrick Stein, Gavin Wright and Curtis Allen were convicted of one count of conspiracy to use a weapon of mass destruction and one count of conspiracy against civil rights. Wright was convicted of a charge of lying to the FBI. Sentencing is set for June 27.
The three men were indicted in October 2016 for plotting an attack for the day after the presidential election in the meatpacking town of Garden City, about 220 miles (350 kilometers) west of Wichita.
Prosecutors have said that a fellow militia member, Dan Day, tipped off federal authorities after becoming alarmed by the escalating talk of violence and later agreed to wear a wire as a paid informant. The government’s case featured months of profanity-laced recordings in which militia members discussed plans and referred to the Somalis as “cockroaches.”
Wright is captured in one recording saying he hoped an attack on the Somalis would “wake people up” and inspire others to take similar action against Muslims.
The government argued that the men formed a splinter group of the militia Kansas Security Force that came to be known as “the Crusaders.” The testimony and recordings indicate the men tried to recruit other members of the Kansas Security Force to join them.
According to prosecutors, Stein was recorded discussing the type of fuel and fertilizer bomb that Timothy McVeigh used in the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing, which killed 168 people. Stein was arrested when he delivered 300 pounds (135 kilograms) of fertilizer to undercover FBI agents to make explosives.
Attorneys for the defense said the FBI set up the men with a paid informant and all the talk about violence wasn’t serious. They said the men had a right to free speech and association under the U.S. Constitution.
Prosecutors argued the plot was more than just words, telling jurors that the men also manufactured homemade explosives and tested them."

EXIT WEST
By Mohsin Hamid
231 pp. Riverhead Books. $26.
You own a house or rent an apartment. You live with your family or by yourself. You wake in the morning and drink your coffee or tea. You drive a car or a motorbike, or perhaps you take the bus. You go to work and turn on your computer. You go out at night and flirt and date. You live in a small town or big city, although maybe you are in the countryside. You have hopes, dreams and expectations. You take your humanity for granted. You keep believing you are human even when the catastrophe arrives and renders you homeless. Your town or city or countryside is in ruins. You try to make it to the border. Only then, hoping to leave, or making it across the border, do you understand that those who live on the other side do not see you as human at all.

This is the dread experience of becoming a refugee, of joining the 65 million unwanted and stateless people in the world today. It is also the experience that Mohsin Hamid elicits quietly and affectingly in his new novel, “Exit West,” which begins “in a city swollen by refugees but still mostly at peace, or at least not yet openly at war.” The city and the country are unnamed, unlike the two characters at the story’s center: Saeed and Nadia, a young man and woman whose courtship begins in this moment of impending crisis. They are cosmopolitan city dwellers who meet in “an evening class on corporate identity and product branding,” and whose first date is at a Chinese restaurant.
Hamid’s enticing strategy is to foreground the humanity of these young people, whose urbanity, romantic inclinations, upwardly mobile aspirations and connectedness through social media and smartphones mark them as “normal” relative to the novel’s likely readers. At the same time, he insists on their “difference” from readers who may be Western. Their city is besieged by militants who commit terrible atrocities, evoking scenes from Mosul or Aleppo. As for Nadia, she was “always clad from the tips of her toes to the bottom of her jugular notch in a flowing black robe.” But while this robe seems to be a form of conservative Islamic dress, one of the starkest signs of difference between Nadia and non-Islamic readers, she is more daring than Saeed. She is the one who offers him marijuana and psychedelic mushrooms, and she is the one who initiates sex. The robe, it turns out, is camouflage to allow Nadia to be an independent woman.
Mohsin Hamid sat down with NewsHour correspondent Jeffrey Brown in March to discuss “Exit West” and what makes refugees leave home. Watch that interview in the player above.
The backdrop for “Exit West” is both the plight of refugees from places like Syria and the specter of Islamic fundamentalism and terrorism. Hamid takes full advantage of our familiarity with these scenes to turn “Exit West” into an urgent account of war, love and refugees. Politics also matters as it does in his other novels, which likewise dealt with pressing issues: the troubles of contemporary Pakistan (“Moth Smoke”); 9/11 and the tensions between being Pakistani and American (“The Reluctant Fundamentalist”); and naked capitalism and ambition in an unnamed country (“How to Get Filthy Rich in Rising Asia”). Throughout his oeuvre, Hamid envisions an interconnected world in which East and West inevitably meet as a consequence of complicated histories of colonization and globalization. The dramas and love stories of individuals like Saeed and Nadia cannot be separated from these histories, even if, in their own lives, those histories are not necessarily preoccupations. Until, that is, those histories erupt.
Only then, hoping to leave, or making it across the border, do you understand that those who live on the other side do not see you as human at all.
When they do, people die. They do so often, unexpectedly and in violent circumstances. Hamid offers a few incidents like this, and in their spare detail they are enough, as when Nadia’s cousin is “blown by a truck bomb to bits, literally to bits, the largest of which, in Nadia’s cousin’s case, were a head and two-thirds of an arm.” Refusing to dwell on the morbidity of such a scene, Hamid declines to turn the destruction of the city and its people into a spectacle, the way they would normally be visible to those outside the country, watching its doom from a digital distance. Examining the destruction at a slight remove, Hamid discourages readers from pitying the city’s residents. Instead, focusing on Saeed and Nadia, and removing the particularities of the city, the country and its customs, Hamid aims to increase the depth of a reader’s empathy for characters who can be, or should be, just like the reader. The reader, of course, must think about what would happen if her own normal life was suddenly, unexpectedly upended by war.

Most likely, the reader, like Saeed and Nadia, would flee. They do so through the sudden, unexplained doors that appear throughout the city and that are portals to other places. While the city is unnamed, these sites of refuge are named — Greece, London, the United States. In their concreteness, versus the deliberate vagueness of Saeed and Nadia’s city, they call for identification from readers of the novel who live in these kinds of desirable places that the refugees want to go. The novel implicitly asks these readers why doors should be closed to refugees, when those readers might become refugees one day? How these doors work is not Hamid’s concern. The doors can be manifestations of magic realism, fantasy or science fiction, or all three, but they simply stand in for the reality that refugees will try every door they can to get out.
What happens once Saeed and Nadia arrive at these promised lands makes up the second half of the novel, in which it seems that “the whole planet was on the move, much of the global South headed to the global North, but also Southerners moving to other Southern places and Northerners moving to other Northern places.” Here Hamid’s novel reveals itself to be a story not only of the present but of the future, where migration will be the norm. Depending on one’s point of view, this is either terrifying or hopeful. When everyone is moving, then mobility becomes normal rather than disturbing. While these movements cause unrest on the part of the “natives” — what Hamid, in a postcolonial reverse, calls the inhabitants of the host countries — the vision that he ultimately offers is peaceful. After the natives get over their initial fear of strangers, both the natives and the strangers discover they are just as likely to get along as not. From this measured, cautious recognition of a mutual humanity, the natives and strangers attempt to forge a new society.
This gentle optimism, this refusal to descend into dystopia, is what is most surprising about Hamid’s imaginative, inventive novel. A graceful writer who does not shy away from contentious politics and urgent, worldly matters — and we need so many more of these writers — Hamid exploits fiction’s capacity to elicit empathy and identification to imagine a better world. It is also a possible world. “Exit West” does not lead to utopia, but to a near future and the dim shapes of strangers that we can see through a distant doorway. All we have to do is step through it and meet them.

President Donald Trump hasn’t made a final decision, but appears more likely to send only $60 million of the planned $125 million first installment to the U.N. Relief and Works Agency, said the officials, who weren’t authorized to publicly discuss the matter and spoke on condition of anonymity.
Future contributions would require the agency, facing heavy Israeli criticism, to demonstrate significant changes in operations, they said, adding that one suggestion under consideration would require the Palestinians to first re-enter peace talks with Israel.
The State Department said Sunday that “the decision is under review. There are still deliberations taking place.” The White House did not immediately respond to questions about the matter.
The administration could announce its decision as early as Tuesday, the officials said. The plan to withhold some of the money is backed by Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Defense Secretary James Mattis, who offered it as a compromise to demands for more drastic measures by U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley, the officials said.
Haley wants a complete cutoff in U.S. money until the Palestinians resume peace talks with Israel that have been frozen for years. But Tillerson, Mattis and others say ending all assistance would exacerbate instability in the Mideast, notably in Jordan, a host to hundreds of thousands of Palestinian refugees and a crucial U.S. strategic partner.
In another sign of the growing tensions in the region, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas railed at Trump in a fiery, two-hour-long speech on Sunday, saying “shame on you” for his treatment of the Palestinians and warning that he would have no problem rejecting what he suggested would be an unacceptable peace plan. The speech by Abbas ratcheted up what has been more than a month of harsh rhetoric toward Trump since the president’s recognition of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital
The U.S. is the Relief and Works Agency’s largest donor, supplying nearly 30 percent of its total budget. The agency focuses on providing health care, education and social services to Palestinians in the West Bank, Gaza Strip, Jordan, Syria and Lebanon.

Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians either fled or were forced from their homes during the war that led to Israel’s establishment in 1948. Today, there are an estimated 5 million refugees and their descendants, mostly scattered across the region.
Eliminating or sharply reducing the U.S. contribution could hamstring the agency and severely curtail its work, putting great pressure on Jordan and Lebanon as well as the Palestinian Authority. Gaza would be particularly hard hit. Some officials, including Israelis, warn that it might push people closer to the militant Hamas movement, which controls Gaza.
The U.S. officials said any reduction in American assistance could be accompanied by calls for European nations and others to help make up the shortfall.
The U.S. donated $355 million in 2016 and was set to make a similar contribution this year; the first installment was to have sent this month.
But after a highly critical Jan. 2 tweet from Trump on aid to the Palestinians, the State Department opted to wait for a formal policy decision before sending any of the $125 million.
Trump’s tweet expressed frustration over the lack of progress in his attempts to broker peace between Israel and the Palestinians, and he pointed the finger at the Palestinians. “We pay the Palestinians HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS a year and get no appreciation or respect,” he said. “But with the Palestinians no longer willing to talk peace, why should we make any of these massive future payments to them?”
It's not only Pakistan that we pay billions of dollars to for nothing, but also many other countries, and others. As an example, we pay the Palestinians HUNDRED OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS a year and get no appreciation or respect. They don’t even want to negotiate a long overdue…
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 2, 2018
Although Trump referred to all U.S. assistance to the Palestinians, the contribution to the refugee agency would be the first to be affected.
Three days after the tweet, at a Jan. 5 White House meeting, senior national security officials try to find a way forward. Led by representatives from the State Department and Pentagon, all but one of the members of the “Policy Coordination Committee” agreed to continue the funding, officials said.
The lone holdout was Haley’s representative, who insisted that Trump’s tweet had set the policy and the money must be cut off, the officials said.
The meeting ended in a stalemate.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu then weighed in, telling his Cabinet that he agreed with the critique of the agency. He said the agency only perpetuates problems and should cease operating in the region. Netanyahu and other Israelis accuse it of contributing to Palestinian militancy and allowing its facilities to be used by militants. They have also complained that some of its staff are biased against Israel.
Netanyahu suggested transferring the agency’s budget to the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, which aids refugee matters everywhere in the world. It was not immediately clear whether any withheld U.S. assistance would be shifted.
Netanyahu’s position, coupled with Haley’s firm opposition to the funding, led Tillerson, with the support of Mattis, to propose the $60 million compromise, the officials said.
Trump, whose Jerusalem decision last year upset the Palestinians along with the announcing plans to move the U.S. Embassy to the holy city, was said by one official to have expressed cautious backing of the compromise."
https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/judge-partially-lifts-trump-administration-ban-on-refugees,refugee,598,2017-12-23T20:12:35-05:00,"Martha Bellisle, Associated Press",Judge partially lifts Trump administration ban on refugees,"SEATTLE — A federal judge in Seattle on Saturday partially lifted a Trump administration ban on certain refugees after two groups argued that the policy prevented people from some mostly Muslim countries from reuniting with family living legally in the United States.
U.S. District Judge James Robart heard arguments Thursday in lawsuits from the American Civil Liberties Union and Jewish Family Service, which say the ban causes irreparable harm and puts some people at risk. Government lawyers argued that the ban is needed to protect national security.
Robart ordered the federal government to process certain refugee applications. He said his order applies to people “with a bona fide relationship to a person or entity within the United States.”
President Donald Trump restarted the refugee program in October “with enhanced vetting capabilities.”
The day before his executive order, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, Acting Homeland Security Secretary Elaine Duke and Director of National Intelligence Daniel Coats sent a memo to Trump saying certain refugees must be banned unless additional security measures are implemented.
It applies to the spouses and minor children of refugees who have already settled in the U.S. and suspends the refugee program for people coming from 11 countries, nine of which are mostly Muslim.
In his decision, Robart wrote that “former officials detailed concretely how the Agency Memo will harm the United States’ national security and foreign policy interests.”
Robart said his order restores refugee procedures in programs to what they were before the memo and noted that this already includes very thorough vetting of individuals.
In a statement, Department of Justice spokeswoman Lauren Ehrsam said: “We disagree with the Court’s ruling and are currently evaluating the next steps.”
The ACLU argued the memo provided no evidence for why additional security was needed and didn’t specify a timeframe for implementing the changes. The groups say the process for imposing the policy violated a federal law.
August Flentje, a Justice Department attorney, told the judge that the ban is temporary and “is a reasonable and appropriate way for agency heads to tackle gaps” in the screening process.
The lawsuits from the two groups were consolidated and represent refugees who have been blocked from entering the country.
The ACLU represents a Somali man living in Washington state who is trying to bring his family to the U.S. They have gone through extensive vetting, have passed security and medical clearances, and just need travel papers, but those were denied after the ban.
Lisa Nowlin, staff attorney for the ACLU of Washington, said in a statement they were happy for their client — “who has not yet had the opportunity to celebrate a single birthday with his younger son in person — will soon have the opportunity to hold his children, hug his wife in the very near future, and be together again as a family for the first time in four years.”
Two other refugees included in the Jewish Family Service lawsuit are former Iraqi interpreters for the U.S. Army whose lives are at risk because of their service.
Another is a transgender woman in Egypt “living in such extremely dangerous circumstances that the U.S. government itself had expedited her case until the ban came down,” said Mariko Hirose, a lawyer with the Jewish Family Service case.
Yet another is a single woman in Iraq, Hirose said. Her husband divorced her after she was kidnapped and raped by militants because she worked with an American company. Her family is in the U.S. but she’s stranded by the ban, Hirose said.

As an asylee in the United States, she does not yet have documentation to travel outside the country. A guest connected her via Skype so she could watch the wedding on her phone. For five hours, she watched the video. “I kept crying the whole day, like what can I do? But there is nothing to do, just hope for a better future.”
Kalo, a mother of two young boys, was born in Homs, Syria. She moved to Saudi Arabia with her family at age 4, and then as an adult to the United Arab Emirates, where she met her husband. They moved to the United States in December 2013. “There is a lot of diversity, especially here in Virginia and D.C., so no one acts like you’re a stranger.”

Her family attended the Refugees’ First Thanksgiving in Arlington, Virginia on Sunday, an event for newly arrived immigrants to share a traditional American meal, potluck-style. They also were encouraged to bring a dish from their homeland, and members of the general public were welcome, too.
“The idea is to introduce the newcomers – to sit together, break bread and talk about what we have in common,” said Sarah Zullo, managing director of the African Community Center. Her organization and the nonprofit refugee resettlement agency, the Ethiopian Community Development Council Inc., sponsor the meal.

Refugees struggle when they first arrive, Zullo said. “It’s not easy to resettle in a new place when you don’t know the language and you know nothing about the culture.” Formal support services last three months, after which the refugees must learn to be self-sufficient.
At another table, Hameed Haqparwar and his wife Saleha greeted friends as their three children: son Moor, 10, daughter Maryam, 5, and 1-year-old son Wajed took laps around the room.
Haqparwar helped monitor USAID projects in Afghanistan for 10 years until he started getting death threats on the phone for helping Americans. “We never knew who they were,” but he suspected insurgents or other people outside the government were angry about his association with the U.S. government. His extended family members also were getting nervous about their own well-being with him there.
His job enabled him to get a Special Immigrant Visa for his immediate family. After a year and a half of security screenings, fingerprinting and background checks, they arrived in the U.S. in March.

Haqparwar said in general, he feels the length of time for the screening was reasonable “to make sure that bad guys would not have the opportunity to come (to the U.S.) among the good guys.”
“Sometimes it could be too long for people who are really in a threatening situation,” he said, but “we were taking our own security precautions” by moving around to different residences while they waited for their visas.
Haqparwar knows English, but his wife, Saleha, is still learning. She said she misses her family terribly, but it was worth coming to the U.S. for the feeling of security. She wants to get her driver’s license and a job as a clothing sales associate one day.
Kalo, the Syrian-born mother, also hopes to land a job as a business analyst after she earns her MBA.
She said when moving to a new country, “You feel like you are just born. You don’t know anything,” but gradually you learn. To the recently arrived refugees, she has this advice: “Be patient. Try your best. Be good with others and be good to yourself.”

Ibrahim’s first cries are met with huge smiles from the Jordanian surgical team that brought him into his new world — a world into which this little bundle of new life, through no fault of his own, is born a refugee.

I was there when Ibrahim entered the world, on a trip to Jordan with UNICEF to report on Syrian refugees there. The Jordanian surgical team is part of a pediatric unit funded by UNICEF, which opened in October 2016. The clinic is located in Azraq refugee camp, developed and operated by the U.N. refugee agency and Jordanian government. Since it opened, the unit has seen children 37,523 times for a multitude of maladies. Between October 2016 and August 2017, some 1,415 children have been born at the unit, which averages six births a day.

“I get more satisfaction working as a humanitarian doctor than I would in the private sector. I could become financially more secure in the private sector but I am happier here helping those who need it most,” says Dr. Hamza al-Amoosh, a Jordanian doctor specializing in obstetrics who bought Ibrahim into the world.
The Syrian refugee women, who arrive at the clinics to either give birth or get pre- or post-birth checkups, also bring with them the strain of their journey to the camp in northern Jordan. In many cases, they also bring severe post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Many of these women are alone, their husbands or entire families killed in the war.

These women are greeted by al-Amoosh and Layla, a midwife with sparkling warm and friendly eyes. Layla is a retired colonel in the Jordanian Army. She says she has devoted “the rest of my life to help these women who need so much help.” In her long career, Layla has delivered thousands of babies, “but there is always one that stays with you in your memories, always.”
“A 16-year-old Syrian girl arrived here alone at the hospital in advanced stages of labor. While she was in labor, she found out that her mother, who was back in Syria, had just been killed by a bomb hitting her house. It was so very sad and we both cried so much together. But the girl’s little baby boy was born so healthy and in between our tears, there were smiles and happiness.”

Kids will be kids, and in the middle of the miracle of life, 6-year-old Thamar has come into the clinic clutching a broken arm. She broke her arm for the second time while climbing on a pile of rocks in the refugee camp.
But the biggest hazard for children in the camp is Hepatitis A. There are 35,065 refugees in Azraq camp. There is only one toilet for every six shelters. Depending on the size of the family in each shelter, this could be as many as 30 to 40 individuals.
But in this camp where sadness is the default, al-Amoosh, Layla and their staff have created a little oasis of happiness for these women and their children.

https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/trumps-refugee-ban-ends-as-white-house-preps-new-screening-rules,refugee,683,2017-10-24T09:28:40-04:00,"Darlene Superville and Josh Lederman, Associated Press",Trump allows refugee admissions to resume with new screening,"WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump on Tuesday allowed the resumption of refugee admissions into the U.S. under new, stricter screening rules but ordered nationals from 11 countries believed to pose higher risk to U.S. national security to face even tougher scrutiny.
Officials refused to identify the 11 countries, but said refugee applications from those nations will be judged case-by-case.
Trump issued his new order on refugee screening as the administration’s four-month ban on refugee admissions expired. It directs federal agencies to resume refugee processing, which he clamped down on shortly after taking office.
The new “enhanced vetting” procedures for all refugees include such measures as collecting additional biographical and other information to better determine whether refugees are being truthful about their status; improving information-sharing between agencies; stationing fraud detection officers at certain locations overseas; and training screeners to weed out fraud and deception.
Refugees already face an extensive backlog and waiting periods that can take years. Additional screening will likely lengthen the wait.
“The security of the American people is this administration’s highest priority, and these improved vetting measures are essential for American security,” said acting Homeland Security Secretary Elaine Duke. “These new, standardized screening measures provide an opportunity for the United States to welcome those in need into our country, while ensuring a safer, more secure homeland.”
Jennifer Sime, senior vice president of U.S. programs for the International Rescue Committee aid group, said in advance of the announcement that she was concerned the new screening procedures would add months or even years to the most urgent refugee cases. She said most of those cases involve women and children in “heinous circumstances who need the permanent and proven solution of resettlement.”
“With a world facing brutal and protracted conflicts like in Syria, or new levels of displacement and unimaginable violence against the Rohingya — this moment is a test of the world’s humanity, moral leadership and ability to learn from the horrors of the past,” she said. Sime was referring to the mounting refugee crisis in Myanmar, where more than 600,000 Rohingya Muslims have fled to Bangladesh to escape retaliation from security forces.
Even with the refugee ban lifted, admissions are expected to be far lower than in recent years.
Trump last month capped refugee admissions at 45,000 for the year that started Oct. 1, a significant cut from the 110,000 limit put in place a year earlier by President Barack Obama. The actual number admitted this year could be lower than 45,000, since the cap sets a maximum limit, not a minimum.
In a separate action Tuesday, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed a case about the refugee ban. An order from the justices wipes away a lower court ruling that found problems with the refugee ban and with a temporary pause on visitors from six mostly Muslim countries. A new travel policy that applies to six countries with Muslim majorities already has been blocked by lower courts.
The limits on refugees were in addition to Trump’s broader “travel ban” on people from several countries. Courts have repeatedly blocked that policy, but largely left the temporary refugee policy in place.
Trump has made limiting immigration a centerpiece of his administration’s efforts to safeguard U.S. national security.
Besides the travel ban, which initially targeted a handful of Muslim-majority nations, the president rescinded an Obama-era executive action protecting immigrants brought to the country as minors from deportation. He has also vowed to build a wall along the border with Mexico.
During the presidential campaign, Trump pledged to “stop the massive inflow of refugees” and warned that terrorists were smuggling themselves into naive countries by posing as refugees fleeing war-torn Syria.
“Thousands of refugees are being admitted with no way to screen them and are instantly made eligible for welfare and free health care, even as our own veterans, our great, great veterans, die while they’re waiting online for medical care that they desperately need,” Trump said last October.
Trump has said the best way to help refugees is to keep them closer to their home countries.

The U.N. has called the actions taken by Myanmar forces against the group “a textbook example of ethnic cleansing.”
A report released by Amnesty International on Wednesday documents widespread rape, killings and burnings of Rohingya across the Rakhine State in Myanmar. The report includes extensive interviews of Rohingya refugees who tell stories of live burnings, sexual violence and mass shootings at the hands of soldiers.
To escape persecution, Rohingya refugees are fleeing in droves to neighboring Bangladesh, a country described by some as a reluctant host for the thousands of refugees behind its borders. Conditions within Bangladesh show refugee camps beyond capacity, as organizations struggle to keep up with humanitarian aid.
Find out more: Rohingya Muslims have been denied citizenship in Myanmar since 1982, though they’ve lived in the area since the 12th century. They are not considered one of the country’s official ethnic groups. As such, their lack of official identity bars them from government services and travel.
Officials from Myanmar, a majority Buddhist state, claim Rohingya are actually immigrants from Bangladesh to justify their exclusion of the group. This most recent burst of violence comes from Myanmar’s crackdown following clashes with the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA). After the government declared ARSA a terrorist organization, the retaliation escalated into hundreds of Rohingya villages.

https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/trump-administration-defends-new-refugee-cap-45000-coming-year,refugee,717,2017-09-27T18:13:39-04:00,"Josh Lederman, Associated Press","Trump administration defends new refugee cap of 45,000 in coming year","WASHINGTON — The Trump administration defended its decision Wednesday to sharply curtail the number of refugees allowed into the United States to 45,000 next year, even as global humanitarian groups decried the move and called the number far too low.
The 45,000 cap, to be formally announced by President Donald Trump in the coming days, reflects the maximum the U.S. will admit during the fiscal year that starts Sunday, although the actual number allowed could be far lower. Even if the cap is ultimately hit, it would reflect the lowest admissions level for the U.S. in more than a decade.
Lowering the cap reflects Trump’s opposition to accepting refugees and other immigrants into the U.S., an approach that has already driven down refugee admissions. Former President Barack Obama had wanted to take in 110,000 in 2017, but the pace slowed dramatically after Trump took office and issued an executive order addressing refugees. The total admitted in the fiscal year that ends Sunday is expected to be around 54,000, officials said. In 2016, the last full year of Obama’s administration, the U.S. welcomed 84,995 refugees.
Though a broad array of criteria determines who receives refugee status, the allotments are broken down into specific numbers of refugees admitted from various geographic regions. The State Department conveyed those numbers to Congress on Wednesday, officials said.
Africa will receive the largest allotment of 19,000 refugees, or 42 percent of the total. The next-highest number goes to the Middle East and South Asia, which will be granted 17,500 slots, or 39 percent. The remaining allotments include 5,000 for East Asia, 2,000 for Europe and 1,500 for Latin America and the Caribbean.
Although the totals are far lower than in the Obama administration, the percentage granted to each region was left almost unchanged from the last year of Obama’s term. One key difference: there will no longer be an “unallocated” allotment of 14,000 refugees that could come from any region.
Trump’s decision has drawn consternation from aid groups who have pointed to refugee crises that have worsened, not improved, including in Syria, Myanmar and South Sudan. Several groups have urged Trump to reconsider and adopt a figure closer to Obama’s goal of 110,000.
“With historically high numbers of innocent people fleeing violence worldwide, the United States response cannot be to welcome a historically low number of refugees into our country,” said Bill O’Keefe of Catholic Relief Services.
But Trump administration officials said the new cap will advance national security interests and reflect the United States’ capacity to properly screen and take in refugees. They said new screening and admittance requirements for refugees will be announced later, as a 6-month review, ordered by Trump near the start of his presidency, draws to a close.
It’s unclear how those requirements might affect individuals from countries included in Trump’s revised travel restrictions, a list that includes Syria, Yemen, Chad, Libya and Somalia. Officials couldn’t say whether people from those countries would be allowed in as refugees. The officials briefed reporters on a conference call on condition of anonymity.
Trump’s administration settled on the 45,000 figure after a vigorous debate among his top advisers, other officials have said, including some who advocated letting in far fewer. Strong opposition to higher levels from some top aides has fueled speculation that Trump’s administration might set a limit of 45,000, but then deliberately slow-walk admissions so that the number actually allowed in is significantly lower.
But officials pushed back, arguing that while it’s often the case that actual admissions are somewhat lower than the cap, the U.S. would work to accept as many as possible within the 45,000 limit.
Worldwide, there were some 22.5 million refugees last year, according to the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, with many more people internally displaced within their home countries. The strong preference among aid groups and governments has been to seek conditions so refugees can return to their homes, rather than being permanently resettled in host countries.
Trump has made limiting immigration the centerpiece of his policy agenda. He temporarily banned visitors from a handful of Muslim-majority nations, has rescinded an Obama-era executive action protecting young immigrants from deportation and insists he’ll build a wall along the southern border with Mexico.

President Donald Trump is expected to announce the cap on refugee admissions following a lengthy debate within his administration about whether to go higher or lower. The figure represents the maximum number of refugees the U.S. would be willing to accept. The actual number of refugees who move to the United States could actually be much lower.
The administration had been considering a ceiling somewhere between 40,000, which the Homeland Security Department recommended, and 50,000, the State Department’s preferred level, according to officials. The new figure appears to be a compromise that Cabinet officials felt would be palatable to the president.

Still, Trump’s stated hostility to accepting refugees and opposition among others in his administration mean the U.S. may not intend to fill all 45,000 slots in the 2018 fiscal year that starts Sunday. The U.S. hasn’t taken in so few refugees in a single year since 2006, when 41,223 were allowed entry.
All of the officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss internal deliberations. They said no decision was final until formally announced by the president. The State Department declined to comment on potential figures ahead of a presidential announcement.
Trump has until Sunday to determine how many refugees to admit. The U.S. welcomed 84,995 in fiscal year 2016, and former President Barack Obama had wanted to raise that number to 110,000 in 2017. But the strong preference among aid groups and governments has been to seek conditions so refugees can return to their homes, rather than being permanently resettled in host countries.

He temporarily banned visitors from a handful of Muslim-majority nations, has rescinded an Obama-era executive action protecting young immigrants from deportation and insisted he’ll build a wall along the southern border with Mexico.

In a speech to the United Nations last week, he thanked Jordan, Turkey and Lebanon for taking in hundreds of thousands of refugees from the Syrian conflict, and described the United States as a “compassionate nation” that has spent “billions and billions of dollars in helping to support this effort.”
“We seek an approach to refugee resettlement that is designed to help these horribly treated people, and which enables their eventual return to their home countries to be part of the rebuilding process,” Trump said.
For the cost of resettling one refugee in the United States, he said, the U.S. can assist more than 10 migrants in their home regions."
https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/president-trump-look-even-stricter-cap-refugees,refugee,886,2017-09-21T10:22:13-04:00,"Jill Colvin, Associated Press",President Trump to look at even stricter cap on refugees,"WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump is considering a further reduction in the number of refugees allowed into the United States as the administration works to re-shape American immigration policy, officials say.
Trump has already slashed refugee admissions once since taking office. Now he faces a decision on how many to admit in the next budget year.
As is often the case with the Trump administration, Cabinet officials are divided as they weigh the costs and potential security risks associated with the program.
The Department of Homeland Security has been pushing for a reduction beyond the 50,000 maximum-entry mark set by Trump earlier this year as part of his travel ban executive orders — a number that is already the lowest in modern American history. In a proposal submitted late last week, the department called for a reduction to 40,000 refugees in the next budget year starting Oct. 1, citing concerns about its workload and ability to adequately vet those seeking entry.
The State Department, which oversees the program, has formally recommended that the number be kept at 50,000, according to Trump administration officials who spoke on condition of anonymity in order to discuss internal deliberations. Agencies had been given until the close of business Wednesday to submit formal recommendations for consideration.
State Department officials would have been inclined to set their recommendation higher, several of the people said, but were taking their cues from the president’s executive order and felt that 50,000 was the highest number that would be palatable to him.
Trump has until Oct. 1, the start of the new fiscal year, to determine how many refugees to admit under the Refugee Act of 1980. He is expected to consider the issue over the weekend, after he finishes up at the U.N. General Assembly in New York, one White House official said.
The U.S. welcomed 84,995 refugees in fiscal year 2016, and former President Barack Obama had wanted to raise that number to 110,000 in 2017.
Trump has made limiting immigration the centerpiece of his policy agenda. He temporarily banned visitors from a handful of Muslim-majority nations, has rescinded an Obama-era executive action protecting young immigrants from deportation and insists he’ll build a wall along the southern border.
During his campaign, Trump pledged to “stop the massive inflow of refugees” and warned that terrorists were smuggling themselves into naive countries by posing as refugees fleeing war-torn Syria.
“Thousands of refugees are being admitted with no way to screen them and are instantly made eligible for welfare and free health care, even as our own veterans, our great, great veterans, die while they’re waiting online for medical care that they desperately need,” Trump said last October.
Instead, Trump has advocated keeping refugees closer to their homes.
In a speech to the United Nations on Tuesday, Trump thanked Jordan, Turkey and Lebanon for taking in hundreds of thousands of refugees from the Syrian conflict, and described the United States as a “compassionate nation” that has spent “billions and billions of dollars in helping to support this effort.”
“We seek an approach to refugee resettlement that is designed to help these horribly treated people, and which enables their eventual return to their home countries to be part of the rebuilding process,” he said, arguing that for the cost of resettling one refugee in the United States, the U.S. can assist more than 10 migrants in their home regions.
Advocates say that misses the point.

“I think that these comments show a basic misunderstanding of the refugee crisis,” said Jen Smyers, who helps run the immigration and refugee program at Church World Service, one of nine organizations that work to resettle refugees in the U.S. She said the safe re-integration of refugees into their home countries is always the preferred outcome, followed by integration in a nearby country that shares a refugee’s language and culture. Resettlement is a last resort when those options are impossible.
Refugees already face an extensive backlog and waiting periods that can take years. Smyers said that after Trump’s executive order, she had to tell refugees in the pipeline they’d be waiting even longer.
“It’s devastating for refugees who are overseas,” she said.
Stacie Blake, of the U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants, said the proposed cutbacks were especially concerning given the migrant crises affecting so many parts of the world, including the Rohingya Muslim refugees fleeing Myanmar. She said Trump’s move could prompt other nations to “back out” as well.
White House spokeswoman Kelly Love said in a statement that the administration’s approach to refugee resettlement “is unwavering” and would be “guided by the safety and security of the American people, the protection of U.S. taxpayers, and the application of U.S. resources in a manner that stretches our dollars to help the most people.”
DHS spokesman David Lapan said that in setting the admissions ceiling, the agency would take into account the “workload capacity of all program partners, including the vetting agencies” as well as national security interests.
Simon Henshaw, the top State Department official for refugees, said the decision was ultimately Trump’s.

The new money for food, medical care, water, sanitation and shelter comes as the U.S. joins a growing chorus of international condemnation over the minority group’s plight. In less than a month, some 421,000 Rohingya have fled to Bangladesh, one of the world’s poorest countries, as the United Nations and others raise allegations of ethnic cleansing.
The crisis has threatened to jeopardize Myanmar’s U.S.-aided shift toward democracy after five decades of harsh military rule. Former President Barack Obama helped shepherd that transition in what is considered one of his key foreign policy achievements. President Donald Trump has been less attentive to the country, also known as Burma.
The exodus has also emerged as major blemish on the record of Myanmar’s civilian leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, who maintained close ties to the Obama administration. Simon Henshaw, the top U.S. diplomat for refugee and migration issues, said the U.S. applauds Suu Kyi’s recent call for the Rohingya to return but is urging her to ensure the situation is safe for them to come home.
“We need the government to take a lot further effort to secure the area, to protect the people,” Henshaw said in an interview on the sidelines of the annual United Nations General Assembly meetings. “We’re concerned about the reports of attacks, extrajudicial murders, rapes, burning of villages.”

The State Department will provide the money from an existing account for refugee and migration issues, officials said, and will coordinate the aid through the International Committee of the Red Cross and affiliated local groups.
Last month, Rohingya insurgents attacked Myanmar security forces, leading to a military crackdown in which Rohingya villages have been burned and hundreds killed. This week Suu Kyi used her first speech on the crisis to defend her country’s actions.
Though Suu Kyi said the “great majority” of Muslims in the conflict zone stayed put and less than half of villages were emptied, the U.S. has been skeptical about that assertion.
“We don’t have the access to evaluate that,” Henshaw said. “But 420,000 people moving into Bangladesh suggests the vast majority of Rohingya are affected.”
The U.S. announcement came as world leaders converged in New York for the U.N. gathering. Suu Kyi did not attend, but on Tuesday, she spoke with Secretary of State Rex Tillerson in what was believed to be their first conversation since Tillerson took office.
Tillerson welcomed Myanmar’s commitment, as expressed in Suu Kyi’s speech, to end the violence and allow those displaced to return home, the State Department said. The Rohingya live mainly in Myanmar’s northern Rakhine state, near the Bangladesh border, and have had a long and difficult history in the predominantly Buddhist nation.
The U.S. said the new money makes up roughly one-fourth of what global aid groups say they need to address the humanitarian crisis, with the expectation that the rest of the world will make up the remaining three-quarters. Over time, the overall cost will probably run into many hundreds of millions, said Eric Schwartz, the president of Refugees International.
“I’ve been doing this work for 30 years,” Schwartz said by phone as he flew back from Bangladesh. “This is as bad as anything I’ve ever seen in terms of the human mystery that the Burmese military has created.”
Schwartz said that in addition to food, water and shelter, the refugees will need clothing, security for camps being erected on the Myanmar-Bangladesh border, education for hundreds of thousands of child refugees, and psychosocial support for those who have experienced trauma during the exodus.
Bangladesh already struggles with overpopulation and is poorly equipped to take in hundreds of thousands of refugees. Even so, the international community has roundly praised the country for its generosity and willingness to help the Rohingya.
The $32 million brings the total the U.S. has given in humanitarian aid for Myanmar refugees and related issues this budget year to roughly $95 million. Although the crisis has worsened sharply in recent weeks, hundreds of thousands more Rohingya were already in Bangladesh from waves of violence years earlier, while others were displaced within Myanmar.

https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/supreme-court-will-allow-trump-administration-ban-refugees,refugee,388,2017-09-12T18:47:39-04:00,"Mark Sherman, Associated Press",Supreme Court will allow Trump administration ban on most refugees,"WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court is allowing the Trump administration to maintain its restrictive policy on refugees.
The justices on Tuesday agreed to an administration request to block a lower court ruling that would have eased the refugee ban and allowed up to 24,000 refugees to enter the country before the end of October.
The order was not the court’s last word on the travel policy that President Donald Trump first rolled out in January. The justices are scheduled to hear arguments on Oct. 10 on the legality of the bans on travelers from six mostly Muslim countries and refugees anywhere in the world.
It’s unclear, though, what will be left for the court to decide. The 90-day travel ban lapses in late September and the 120-day refugee ban will expire a month later.
The administration has yet to say whether it will seek to renew the bans, make them permanent or expand the travel ban to other countries.
Lower courts have ruled that the bans violate the Constitution and federal immigration law. The high court has agreed to review those rulings. Its intervention so far has been to evaluate what parts of the policy can take effect in the meantime.
The justices said in June that the administration could not enforce the bans against people who have a “bona fide” relationship with people or entities in the United States. The justices declined to define the required relationships more precisely.
A panel of the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a district judge’s order that would have allowed refugees to enter the United States if a resettlement agency in the U.S. had agreed to take them in.

The administration objected, saying the relationship between refugees and resettlement agencies shouldn’t count. The high court’s unsigned, one-sentence order agreed with the administration, at least for now.
The appeals court also upheld another part of the judge’s ruling that applies to the ban on visitors from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen.
Grandparents and cousins of people already in the U.S. can’t be excluded from the country under the travel ban, as the Trump administration had wanted. The administration did not ask the Supreme Court to block that part of the ruling."

“Those who have made it to Bangladesh are in poor condition,” said U.N. refugee agency spokeswoman Duniya Aslam Khan in Geneva. “Most have walked for days from their villages – hiding in jungles, crossing mountains and rivers with what they could salvage from their homes. They are hungry, weak and sick.”

About 30,000 have gone to existing refugee camps in Bangladesh, while others have sought shelter in villagers’ homes, schools, community centers and madrassas. The new arrivals joined about 200,000 refugees from Myanmar holed up in Cox’s Bazar, a fishing port in Bangladesh.
“We are running out of space in the existing settlements, and new arrivals are pitching camp wherever they can erect some plastic sheeting to protect themselves from the elements,” said Sarat Dash, the International Organization for Migration’s Bangladesh chief of mission.

Who are the Rohingya? The Rohingya are an ethnic mostly Muslim minority group living in Rakhine state on the western coast of Myanmar. The government says they are illegal immigrants from Bangladesh and does not recognize them as one of the country’s 135 ethnic groups. A 1982 law prevented the Rohingya from gaining citizenship, which restricts their job opportunities.
The Rohingya face “severe restrictions,” including curfews and a heavy security presence in villages, along with needing official authorization to travel between townships and villages, reported the United Nations. Villagers described beatings, rapes and their homes getting burned allegedly by security forces, according to the report.

On Aug. 25, Rohingya insurgents attacked two dozen police posts and an army base. At least 12 members of the security forces and dozens of militants reportedly were killed. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called the attacks “unacceptable” and expressed concern over escalating tensions.

Reaction from Nobel laureates: In December, Bangladeshi social entrepreneur and Nobel Peace Prize recipient in 2006 Muhammad Yunus wrote an open letter to the U.N. Security Council “to end the ethnic cleansing” of the Rohingya people.
Some of the same Nobel laureates again called for an end to the violence after the Aug. 25 flashpoint, including Liberian peace activist Leymah Gbowee, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2011:

Malala Yousafzai, 2014 Nobel laureate, issued a statement: “Over the last several years, I have repeatedly condemned this tragic and shameful treatment. I am still waiting for my fellow Nobel Laureate Aung San Suu Kyi to do the same. The world is waiting and the Rohingya Muslims are waiting.”

Suu Kyi, a long-time human rights activist, was under house arrest from 1989 to 2010 while the country was under military rule. In 2016, Myanmar got its first democratically elected president, Htin Kyaw, who is now considered Suu Kyi’s proxy since she was constitutionally barred from becoming president.
In the first government statement since the recent refugee exodus, Suu Kyi said while speaking with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan that her government had “already started defending all the people in Rakhine in the best way possible.”
The statement reported Wednesday also said there was a lot of fake news circulating which was the “tip of a huge iceberg of misinformation calculated to create a lot of problems between different communities and with the aim of promoting the interest of the terrorists.”
Pope Francis, meanwhile, plans to travel to Myanmar from Nov. 27 to 30 and Bangladesh from Nov. 30 to Dec. 2 to show his support for the Rohingya. “I would like to express my closeness to them and all of us ask the Lord to save them and to prompt men and women of good faith to help them and ensure their full rights,” he said.

The report from the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees stated an average of 1,800 refugees had entered Uganda each day over the past 12 months. The number of migrants increased rapidly after deadly fighting erupted in the South Sudan capital of Juba in July 2016, the Associated Press reported.
Eighty-five percent of the new arrivals are women and children fleeing the violence. The U.N. said refugees have relayed stories of women and girls being sexually assaulted, armed groups burning down houses with people inside and boys forced to become soldiers.
“The U.N. is urgently calling on the international community, one for funding and two, for political support so that leaders can help bring them (warring sides) to the negotiating table,” said Charlie Yaxley, a spokesman for the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees in Uganda.
Uganda needs $674 million to assist South Sudanese refugees this year, according to the U.N. The nation is receiving about one-fifth of that amount.

Uganda is an attractive destination for refugees because of a welcoming policy toward migrants. Refugees are placed in settlements — or provided with land in the same communities as locals — instead of camps. Refugees are also issued a legal I.D. that allows them to move freely throughout the country.
In recent years, that policy has been tested, as Uganda’s neighbors experience unrest. More than two million people from South Sudan overall have fled since the country’s crisis began in 2013. Along with Uganda, South Sudanese refugees have also migrated into the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Central African Republic, Kenya and Ethiopia.
“Refugees have seen their food rations cut in half, and there aren’t enough doctors or medicine,” Yaxley said. “Many of the refugees are arriving sick and starving. They have been forced to walk through the bush lands because armed groups are located on the major exits, preventing people to leave from traditional routes.”.
As a result, he said, people are being forced to eat grass and poisonous berries. Many are turning to polluted rivers for drinking water, where the chances of contracting malaria are also higher.
The report called on countries around the world to increase their funding for relief efforts.

They took them to an outdoor arts festival, where they indulged in the most traditional American fair food: funnel cakes.
It’s the type of interaction Sloane Davidson, a former refugee resettlement worker, had in mind when she formed Hello Neighbor. Her Pittsburgh-based network matches refugees with “mentor” families to help them become better accustomed to life in the U.S.
Nine refugee resettlement agencies around the U.S. set up arrival families with a place to live, furniture and basic household items. They help find them jobs and English-language classes, and provide about three months of federal funding for rent and food.
“After that initial 90 days, they really are on their own and are expected to be self-sufficient and integrated into society,” said Davidson. “It can be very challenging. I wanted Hello Neighbor to step in when the other programs end.”

Gartner, Garbarino and the other mentor families attended a day-long training session where they learned about the global plight of refugees and how to relate to those moving to the U.S. They heard from an Iranian refugee, who now attends an American law school, about her experiences, and from a representative of the Greater Pittsburgh Literacy Council about its education resources. The mentees also underwent a training day about what they could expect from the program, and only two indicated that they had an American friend outside of their work or other daily interactions.
“I didn’t realize how isolated the refugee communities were in Pittsburgh,” said Garbarino.
Davidson’s four-month pilot program paired 25 refugee families with 25 American families. The refugees may need assistance with anything from getting a driver’s license to enrolling their children in school. But they also get a chance to attend music shows and museum exhibits, and just enjoy what the community has to offer through weekly family-oriented activities.
“All of our families have been here between six months and five years, so it’s really about providing support, friendship and mentorship from a position of being equals and not as much of a power dynamic. We’re not case workers or social workers,” said Davidson. “These families do tend to be self-starters because they went through a minimum two years’ process to get resettled.”

Gartner and Garbarino’s family has been in the U.S. for about a year. The mother, though originally from Rwanda, had lived for 15 years in Nairobi, Kenya, where she owned a hair salon. She is looking to get her cosmetology license in the U.S. and open another salon specializing in hair-braiding. Her two older children, 20 and 22, attended college in Kenya and now are working, and her 15-year-old boy has a summer job doing data entry for the Pittsburgh University Engineering Department. “That sounds horrible,” Gartner laughed, “but his favorite subject in school is algebra.”
One of their first get-togethers, along with the arts festival, was helping the family move from their first apartment into a larger place. “It was really awesome to see them make this next step into feeling that America is their home,” said Garbarino.
After each activity, the mentor family fills out a form for Davidson so she can keep track of some basic statistics.
The refugee families in this first match-up come from the Democratic Republic of Congo, Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria, Rwanda and Myanmar. Many have lived in multigenerational families that they had to leave behind, and Davidson said she hopes the community rallying around them will replicate that support.
READ MORE: How are refugees vetted today?
The local community seems to have embraced the idea of the mentorship program as well. Davidson got four times as many applicants to be mentor families than slots available in the pilot program.
“Many Americans are willing to put a sign in their yard, sign a petition online, or go to a rally or protest,” she said. “But they maybe didn’t know any refugees or immigrants directly, and this is an opportunity on a grassroots level to feel like you’re able to make a difference in your life and their lives.”
The first class of mentors graduates in October, and that’s when the next class with all new participants will begin. After they graduate, the families can continue to meet up if they want, Davidson noted.
“It’s not so easy to just talk to people you don’t know, but that’s how you never meet these people in our community,” said Garbarino. “We get along so well with this family, but if it weren’t for this program, we would never have met them.”

But the justices are leaving in place a lower court order that makes it easier for travelers from six mostly Muslim countries to enter the United States.
The administration had appealed last week’s ruling by U.S. District Judge Derrick Watson that required the government to allow in refugees formally working with a resettlement agency in the United States. Watson also vastly expanded the family relations that refugees and visitors can use to get into the country.
The high court on Wednesday blocked Watson’s order as it applies to refugees, but not the expanded list of relatives. The justices said the federal appeals court in San Francisco should now consider the appeal. It’s not clear how quickly that will happen.
In the meantime, though, up to 24,000 refugees who already have been assigned to a charity or religious organization in the U.S. will not be able to use that connection to get into the country.
The Supreme Court also denied the administration’s request to clarify its ruling last month that allowed the administration to partially reinstate a 90-day ban on visitors from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen and a 120-day ban on refugees from anywhere in the world.
The court’s ruling exempted a large swath of refugees and travelers with a “bona fide relationship” with a person or an entity in the U.S. The justices did not define those relationships but said they could include a close relative, a job offer or admission to a college or university.
Watson’s order added grandparents, grandchildren, brothers-in-law, sisters-in-law, aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews and cousins to a list that already included a parent, spouse, fiance, son, daughter, son-in-law, daughter-in-law or sibling already in the U.S. The expanded list of relatives remains in effect.
Justices Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch and Clarence Thomas would have blocked Watson’s order in its entirety. Those same three justices said last month they would have allowed the Trump travel ban to take full effect."

In response to a Hawaii federal judge’s order last week, the department instructed U.S. diplomats to consider grandparents, grandchildren, brothers-in-law, sisters-in-law, aunts and uncles, nephews and nieces and first cousins to meet the criteria for applicants from the six countries to receive a U.S. visa.
They had been omitted by the department after the Supreme Court partially upheld the Trump administration’s travel ban in June. Initially, it had included only parents, spouses, fiancés, children, adult sons or daughters, sons-in-law, daughters-in-law and siblings. Monday’s instructions change that.
“The ruling is effective immediately and we have issued instructions to our embassies and consulates to use the expanded definition when adjudicating visa cases,” the department said. Under the rules, applicants from the six countries — Syria, Sudan, Iran, Somalia, Libya and Yemen — have to prove a bona fide relationship with a person or entity, including a “close familial relationship” in the U.S. to be exempt from the ban.
READ MORE: The Supreme Court just had a quiet term. These high-profile cases are about to change that.
U.S. District Judge Derrick Watson had ruled on Thursday that excluding grandparents and others defied common sense.
“Common sense, for instance, dictates that close family members be defined to include grandparents,” he wrote. “Indeed grandparents are the epitome of close family members.”
The Trump administration has appealed the Hawaii order to the Supreme Court saying that Watson’s interpretation of the Supreme Court’s ruling on what family relationships qualify refugees and visitors from the six Muslim-majority countries to enter the U.S. “empties the court’s decision of meaning, as it encompasses not just ‘close’ family members, but virtually all family members. Treating all of these relationships as ‘close familial relationship(s)’ reads the term ‘close’ out of the Court’s decision.”"

Once the cap is hit, only refugees with a close relationship with a person or business in the United States will be eligible for admission. As of Thursday morning, admissions for fiscal 2017 stood at 49,501.
After the Supreme Court last month partially upheld the Trump administration’s travel ban for citizens of six mainly Muslim countries and portions of a suspension in refugee admissions, resettlement agencies were initially told to schedule arrivals only through July 6.

Introduction
The annual summit of the Group of Twenty (G20), a gathering of the world’s largest economies, has evolved into a major forum for discussing the most pressing global issues. One of the group’s most impressive achievements was its robust response to the 2008 global financial crisis, but some analysts say its cohesion has since frayed.
The July 2017 summit in Hamburg, Germany, is the first for U.S. President Donald Trump, who has already clashed with many of the group’s members over trade, climate, and refugee policy. While the group’s meetings will be closely watched, bilateral meetings taking place on the summit’s sidelines are of particular interest this year, especially because Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin are scheduled to meet for the first time.
What is the G20 summit and who will be attending?
The G20 comprises the nineteen countries that have the world’s largest economies, as well as the European Union.

Every year the heads of G20 members meet to discuss a wide range of issues, with a focus on economic and financial matters, and coordinate policy when possible. Lower-level meetings among finance ministers and other policymakers take place in the run-up to the leaders’ summit. The G20 is not a permanent institution with a headquarters, offices, or staff. Instead, its leadership rotates on an annual basis among its members, its decisions are made by consensus, and implementation of its agenda depends on the political will of the individual states.
In 2017, the rotating G20 presidency belongs to Germany, which will host the two-day leaders’ summit in Hamburg starting July 7. In addition to Trump and Putin, high-profile leaders in attendance are expected to include German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Chinese President Xi Jinping, and newly elected French President Emmanuel Macron. Trump’s aides said a week before the meeting that they had no specific agenda for the Putin talks. That meeting comes as Trump is under domestic political pressure for alleged ties to Russia, which, U.S. intelligence agencies say, mounted cyberattacks on American electoral systems ahead of Trump’s election.
What’s on the agenda?
The G20 initially focused largely on economic policy, but it has expanded its ambit in recent years. Ahead of Hamburg, Merkel stressed the theme of a “networked world,” and the German government laid out a broad agenda.
Topping the list is financial regulation, and in particular addressing what Germany calls “harmful tax competition” between countries—the widespread use by companies and individuals of low-tax countries as tax shelters, as was dramatized by the 2016 Panama Papers leaks. The G20 is also pursuing policies, including information-sharing initiatives, to combat corruption and money laundering.
Merkel has made ties with Africa a focus of the summit. Her government has presented a “Compact with Africa” initiative that would involve G20 nations bringing private investment, job growth, and new businesses to African states that have committed to economic reforms.
Other trade and economic-growth plans are also high on the agenda. Germany wants to reaffirm a global commitment to free trade and discuss how to implement the UN’s “2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development,” a set of far-reaching goals for eliminating poverty around the world.
Beyond purely economic measures, Germany wants to recommit the G20 nations to meeting their carbon-reduction goals under the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change, although the U.S. withdrawal from the accord makes it a notable outlier. Germany also aims to expand research and development on combating infectious diseases, and coordinate responses to the migration and refugee crises in Africa, Europe and the Middle East.

What are the main points of contention?
Much of the uncertainty surrounding the 2017 summit stems from President Trump’s reorientation of U.S. foreign policy, which has placed the United States at odds with much of the rest of the G20, and especially with its host, Germany.
Tensions have also arisen between Turkey and its German hosts, most recently over Germany’s denial of a request by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to address Turks at a rally in Hamburg. Meanwhile, embattled British Prime Minister Theresa May will face many of the European partners with whom she is negotiating her country’s exit from the EU. This comes shortly after elections that significantly weakened her position.
What is the importance of the G20?
Taken together, the nations of the G20 account for around 80 percent of global GDP, nearly 75 percent of all global trade, and about two-thirds of the world’s population.
The group was formed in 1999, in the wake of the Asian financial crisis, as a new forum that would unite finance ministers and central bankers from the world’s largest established and emerging economies. A decade later, at the height of the global economic crisis, the G20 was elevated to the leaders’ level, to include heads of state and government. President George W. Bush hosted the first such gathering in November 2008. Many experts credit the G20 with quick action that, in the words of CFR’s Stewart Patrick, “rescued a global financial system in free fall.” In 2008 and 2009, G20 nations agreed to spending measures worth $4 trillion to revive their economies, rejected trade barriers, and implemented far-reaching reforms of the financial system.
Since then, Patrick and other observers say, the G20 has struggled to achieve similar success on its goals of coordinating their monetary and fiscal policies, achieving higher growth, and rooting out corruption and tax evasion. Geopolitical analyst Ian Bremmer has argued against the G20’s utility, saying that there is instead a “G-Zero” world—one in which countries go it alone or form ad hoc coalitions to pursue their interests.
How has the Trump administration approached other summits?
In his first six months, Trump has unsettled American allies due to his sharp shift in the U.S. approach to multilateral institutions. Throughout his presidential campaign, he criticized members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) for spending too little and called the alliance “obsolete.” At his first NATO summit, in May 2017, he conspicuously declined to back the organization’s Article V provision, which commits each member to the bloc’s common defense. At the same time, some experts have credited Trump with helping to spur an increase in defense spending by NATO states that the United States has long sought. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said on June 28 that NATO states planned to increase their defense spending by 4.3 percent this year. (Some of the increases were in place before Trump’s election in November.)
Trump’s first G7 summit, which was also in May, further demonstrated his willingness to defy the United States’ traditional allies. There, despite heavy pressure from European leaders, he refused to commit to a common climate policy. Analysts say he also strained relations with German policymakers, and Merkel said that Europe could no longer “fully rely” on the United States.

The latest effort comes through Trump’s federal budget proposal, which calls for a 25 percent cut in funds for resettling refugees on American soil.
If approved by Congress, the 2018 budget blueprint would lower overall refugee funding to $2.7 billion from $3.1 billion — a 13 percent drop. That includes U.S. contributions to international aid groups helping refugees in other countries.
But the funds specifically earmarked for U.S. refugee admissions would face a steeper reduction, to $410 million from $544.7 million as recently as 2016. Figures for the current fiscal year, which ends in September, aren’t available yet.
The budget request also eliminates the separate emergency refugee and migration funds that Congress allocated $50 million to in the 2017 appropriations bill. Spending for such programs would be consolidated into the broader refugee account, meaning less cash could be available for new refugee crises.
[READ MORE: Trump’s travel ban showdown headed for Supreme Court]
Trump’s proposals face broad opposition in Congress and among refugee advocates but reflect his consistent push to tighten refugee rules. His battle to suspend refugee entries and ban visas for citizens of six predominantly Muslim countries appears set to go to the Supreme Court after a federal appeals court last week upheld a judge’s earlier decision to block the new restrictions.
During the presidential campaign, Trump repeatedly vowed to ban Muslims — notably including refugees from Syria — from entering the U.S. until “extreme vetting” measures were established to determine that they don’t pose a threat. U.S. officials and refugee advocates maintain that refugees are already subjected to comprehensive vetting.
Last week, in response to Congress’ latest spending bill, the State Department rescinded a limit on refugee admissions it had imposed amid budgetary and legal uncertainty early this year.
While officials said they couldn’t predict the impact of Trump’s proposed cuts to the refugee admissions program, they said it will almost certainly mean fewer refugees eventually accepted into the country. The impact may be delayed because “significant” funds for 2017 resettlement that were held up by Trump’s now-blocked executive order will carry over into 2018, according to two officials who deal with refugee admissions. They weren’t authorized to speak publicly on the matter and demanded anonymity.
Congress has yet to weigh in on the budget. Lawmakers of both parties have said they oppose many of Trump’s spending proposals, which include a 31-percent cut to the State Department and U.S. Agency for International Development.
Despite federal court injunctions and possible congressional action, Trump may go another route to reducing admissions.
[READ MORE: Is Trump’s revised travel ban constitutional?]
Officials are bracing for a possible steep cut in the target for refugee admissions. Trump must determine the target by the start of the next budget year on Oct. 1. His March immigration order that has been halted by the courts had capped the number at 50,000. That is less than half of the 110,000 target former President Barack Obama adopted last September.
With Trump’s cap not yet coming into effect, the State Department appears to be trying to admit the maximum number of refugees possible under court rulings and available money.
On May 25, the department’s Bureau of Population, Refugees and Migration notified refugee advocacy groups that it would lift an admissions limit it imposed early this year because of budget uncertainties, officials said.
It had limited admissions to 900 refugees per week, compared to an average of 2,000 admitted per week in 2016.
The numbers are unlikely to rise as high as the pre-Trump level this year, officials said. Any increase is likely to be gradual and probably won’t be reflected in actual admissions for several weeks."

Jeanne Trabulsi of Arlington, Virginia, would like to fix that.
Trabulsi was dismayed at how refugees fleeing into Europe – many of them Muslim – often were cast in political discourse as violent troublemakers. She had studied at the American University of Beirut, gotten to know many in the Arab and Islamic world, and knew better.
As more refugees resettled in the United States, she wanted to come up with ways to make them feel welcome.
Her research led her to an existing Portland, Maine-based initiative called I’m Your Neighbor, aimed at helping young children learn what it’s like to be a newly arrived immigrant or refugee, through classroom activities and books. Portland has a growing Somali community.
One of the books, called “I’m New Here” by Anne Sibley O’Brien, tells the story of three children from Guatemala, South Korea and Somalia who learn to adapt to an American school while preserving the identities of their home countries. A lesson plan for teachers encourages students to think how they can help the newly arrived students feel at ease. It can be simple things like introducing themselves and inviting them to play.
Watch students at Fred P. Hall Elementary School in Portland, Maine, participate in the I’m Your Neighbor exercises.
Meanwhile, one of Trabulsi’s friends mentioned that there should be a doll from the Islamic world available in the United States.
That helped spark the idea for a website Trabulsi launched this year, called the Refugee Doll Project, to help parents and teachers explain to children what it means to be a refugee and end up in a new place.
Trabulsi recruited a seamstress, and they designed patterns that anyone handy with a needle and thread can download from her website to sew outfits for their 18-inch dolls. The dresses and leggings are simple. “I want these dolls to look like the kids who go to school,” rather than traditional dress, she said.
She put everything – the clothing patterns and links to the Portland lesson plan and book – on her website, along with tips on where to buy the materials.
Trabulsi recently held a how-to at Arlington County Public Library for adults who work with children on how they could use the book and lesson plan at their schools, library reading circles, and Girl and Boy Scout troop meetings.

She also brought some of the dolls, representing youths from Africa, Central America and the Islamic world wearing hijabs, to the Taste of Islam open house at the Dar Al-Hijrah Islamic Center in Falls Church, Virginia, on April 23.
Many people who stopped by her table wanted to buy the prototype dolls. One admirer was Dina Abutaa, who came from Jordan at age 10 and now lives in Oakton, Virginia.
“I would love to get one for my granddaughter,” said Abutaa, who wears a hijab. “To see a doll with one is unusual, and it would make her feel like she’s not different” if she chooses to wear the head covering herself one day.
Trabulsi said she doesn’t have the capacity to sell the dolls for now. Her hope is that libraries and schools will use the guidelines on her website to create their own and make them available for rotation.
She also tells people who are interested in donating to her project that they can send their new or used 18-inch dolls and fabric to Catholic Charities’ Migration and Refugee Services office on Glebe Road in Arlington, where she will pick them up. Of course, volunteers willing to sew the outfits are welcome as well, she added.
Trabulsi said she got many blessings that day at the Islamic Center open house. “I feel like if I die today, I’m going to go straight to heaven,” she laughed.

But “Because We Come From Everything: Poetry & Migration,” a project that launched this month with 25 poetry organization in 15 cities, has since resonated in ways the groups didn’t anticipate, with hundreds writing in and tens of thousands reading the poems online.
“I think people naturally come to poetry in times of crisis and confusion,” said Jen Benka, head of the American Academy of Poets, which organized the effort. “But for this project we took the poetry to them.”
Among the more interesting efforts came from the Wick Poetry Center at Kent State University in Ohio. Through a program it calls “Traveling Stanzas,” the center has disseminated the poetry of local refugee and immigrant children and adults by putting up posters on public transportation, and also posting videos of those poems online.
Meanwhile, the nonprofit Kundiman, which promotes Asian-American poets, encouraged people to send physical and online postcards around the theme of migration.

From Syria alone, 5 million people have fled the country since the civil war began, and millions more are displaced inside the country.
On the arts desk, we often find that geopolitics and art intersect, and they do in Viet Thanh Nguyen’s new book of short stories “The Refugees,” which explores the aspirations and heartbreak of immigration and refugee life, as countries around the world debate whether or not to take in migrants. Nguyen himself came to the U.S. from Vietnam as a refugee with his family in 1975.
Nguyen recently sat down with NewsHour arts correspondent Jeffrey Brown to discuss what it means to be a refugee today, and how that differs from being an immigrant. Here’s what he had to say:
To be a refugee, especially in our contemporary moment, is to be different than an immigrant. Immigrants are somewhat acceptable to Europe and the United States. But refugees are the unwanted from wherever they come from and they’re often unwanted where they come to. And especially in the United States, Americans think it’s un-American to be a refugee. So it’s actually really important to me to assert, “I am a refugee, I write about refugees,” and that we need to think about the necessity of opening our doors and welcoming refugees in…
I think immigrants do feel some of that attachment to wherever they came from but they usually made a choice to go somewhere and they’ve decided to look forward, to some extent. But refugees are often compelled to leave by violent circumstance. They’re really still attached to wherever they came from, but they’re often times looking backwards. So that’s where I think refugees often times have a hard time adjusting at least psychologically. They may adjust culturally and economically but psychologically half of them is still somewhere else.

But turn the talk specifically to the risks and benefits of admitting refugees to the U.S., and the New Jersey resident gives a fraught sigh.
“It’s hard not to be conflicted,” said Wright, 26, an independent who supports President Donald Trump’s proposed travel ban on certain foreigners. “By no means do I want to be cruel and keep people out who need a safe place. But we have to have a better system of thoroughly finding out who they are.”
Wright is part of a group of Americans a new survey suggests are making distinctions between legal immigrants who choose to be here and refugees — who are legal immigrants, too — fleeing persecution in their home countries. A new poll by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research reflects that divide, with two-thirds of the respondents saying the benefits of legal immigration generally outweigh the risks. But just over half — 52 percent — say refugees pose a great enough risk to further limit their entry into the United States.
WATCH: New travel ban targets those seeking new visas from six Muslim-majority countries
Interviews with some of the poll’s participants suggest the distinction may be one of perception in an age of religious and politically inspired violence and 4.8 million refugees fleeing war-scarred Syria.
“Sometimes the vetting might not be quality,” said Randall Bagwell, 33, a Republican from of San Antonio, Texas, the state second to California in settling refugees between Oct. 1 and Jan. 31, according to the State Department. “Nobody can do quality control when they’re just reacting immediately.”
President Donald Trump has long linked tougher immigration limits to a safer country, and on Monday signed a new travel ban that, in part, will suspend refugee travel to the U.S. for four months except for those already on their way to the United States. The new order, which takes effect on March 16, will impose a 90-day ban on entry to the United States for people from Sudan, Syria, Iran, Libya, Somalia and Yemen — all Muslim-majority nations — who are seeking new visas. It was Trump’s second effort at a travel ban. The first was blocked by the courts.

Also reflecting his hard line, Trump last week announced to Congress a new office to aid Americans and their families who are victims of immigrant violence. That’s despite years of studies that have shown that immigrants are less likely to commit crimes than U.S.-born people.
Much of Trump’s candidacy and young presidency have been powered by the idea that he will protect Americans from “bad dudes” who want to come here, issuing a mix of tough, if vague, policy — from “extreme vetting” to the travel ban, a border wall with Mexico and more.
Americans report conflicting feelings about immigrants just over six weeks into his presidency, the poll suggests. On the one hand, Americans see refugees as a risk apart from other legal immigrants, with a third of Democrats and 8 in 10 Republicans saying the risks are great enough to place more limits on refugees admitted to the U.S. Despite those fears, Americans still see legal immigration generally as a boon, the poll shows. More than 6 in 10 say a major benefit of legal immigration is that it enhances the reputation of the United States as a land of opportunity.
The good and bad of immigration has long been a painful and intensifying national debate. Trump has shown some flexibility — or inconsistency, depending on one’s viewpoint — on his approach. For example, Iraq is no longer on the list of countries whose people are banned. Officials from the Pentagon and State Department had urged the White House to reconsider given Iraq’s key role in fighting the Islamic State group. Also, the new order does not subject Syrians to an indefinite travel ban, as did the original.
READ MORE: Here’s what the Mexico border wall looks like now
Trump also has minimized talk of deporting all of the estimated 11 million people in the U.S. illegally and suggested that he could be open to comprehensive immigration reform. That sparked both interest and skepticism on Capitol Hill, where a solution has stymied Congress for years.
But Trump’s warnings about refugees in particular apparently have stuck in the American consciousness, according to the poll.
Refugees entering the U.S. undergo rigorous background checks, including a search of government databases that list people suspected of having ties to terrorist groups. Processing of refugees can take up to two years — and usually longer for those coming from Syria. After a year in the U.S., refugees are required to check in and obtain green cards. But U.S. officials have acknowledged that information on people coming from Syria, in particular, may be limited.
Mandy Gibson, 37, sees the benefits of admitting legal immigrants — but isn’t so sure about refugees.
“Maybe it’s the media. They are making refugees sound like they aren’t legal immigrants and I don’t necessarily understand, but they are different to me,” said Gibson, who works in a Greensboro, North Carolina, grocery store. Either way, she said, “anybody who is coming from countries that have ISIS really should have a very thorough background check.”
YOU ASKED: How are refugees vetted today?
The AP-NORC poll of 1,004 adults was conducted Feb. 16-20, using a sample drawn from NORC’s probability-based AmeriSpeak panel, which is designed to be representative of the U.S. population. The margin of sampling error for all respondents is plus or minus 3.9 percentage points."

Only a small fraction of refugees are referred for resettlement to 30 countries, including the U.S., said Chris Boian, a spokesman for the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, or UNHCR, the U.N. agency tasked with coordinating the international refugee response.
READ MORE: You asked: How are refugees vetted today?
Out of 16 million refugees who are registered with the U.N. refugee agency, only 150,000 were resettled in other countries last year, of which 85,000 came to the U.S. “The U.S. has traditionally been the largest recipient of refugees in need of resettlement,” he said.
Once they flee their home country, refugees can register with the government of the host country and UNHCR to receive assistance.
UNHCR conducts interviews and works with the host governments and local partners to determine which refugees are most in need of resettling in a third country. Refugees who get the priority are those with acute medical needs, like someone needing heart surgery; at-risk women and girls, including single female heads of households; and victims of torture.
UNHCR conducts interviews, gathers and cross-checks biographical information, and collects biometric data, such as iris scans for Syrians and fingerprints.
The refugees who agree to enter the resettlement process don’t get to choose where they go, said Boian. UNHCR works with countries willing to accept refugees to determine where to refer them, taking into account the country’s quotas, if the refugees have friends or family already living there, and their cultural affinities, he said.
Once a decision on the placement country is made, UNHCR delivers a list of the refugees for the government to consider. The governments themselves then begin the process of their own screening.
Some refugees wouldn’t get referred to the U.S., such as those who committed a crime or are deemed a security risk for any reason, said Boian. “We don’t want to make referrals when we know there’s no chance it will work out.”
Those not selected for resettlement either remain in the host country or, if they want to go home, they can do so, he said.
Countries also can admit refugees separate from UNHCR. An example is the U.S. special immigrant visa program, which applies mostly to Afghan and Iraqi translators or others who may have worked with the U.S. military and are deemed at risk in their home countries because of the work.
The State Department oversees refugee vetting for the United States, and it is all conducted overseas before visas are issued and the refugees arrive in the U.S.
President Donald Trump halted the refugee resettlement program in an executive order last month to review vetting procedures. A federal court put a stop to that order, and the administration is planning to release a revised version in the coming days.
Mr. Trump said in a speech to Congress on Tuesday that he wanted to switch to a “merit-based” immigration system based on the principle that those seeking to enter the U.S. “are able to support themselves financially.”
Boian said refugees — or those forced to flee their homes — are a different, smaller category than economic migrants. Refugees get financial support for the first few months they arrive in the U.S., after which they are expected to provide for themselves.
They get jobs, send their children back to school, and are just thankful to have a safe and healthy place to live, he said.

A federal court put a stop to the order last month. Mr. Trump said at a press conference Thursday that he planned to release a new version this week, based on the court’s ruling.
As we’ve covered the immigration ban and the debate around it, PBS NewsHour viewers have asked: How long does refugee processing take now? What kinds of checks and interviews take place? How did President Trump’s order aim to change that?
We took your questions to Sarah Krause, senior director for programs at the Church World Service’s Immigration and Refugee Program, to create a quick guide to the U.S. refugee vetting process as it stands.
Who are refugees?
Refugees are those forced to flee their home country due to a fear of persecution based on:
They must have crossed a border from their home country to another country to be considered a refugee. In the second country, they can file for protection with the U.N. refugee agency, known as the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees.
UNHCR determines whether to return refugees to their home country if it’s safe; keep them in the country in which they’ve sought refuge; or resettle them in a third country, like the U.S.
For the third option, the U.N. refugee agency, along with the U.S. Embassy or a nongovernmental organization, can refer the refugee to the U.S. to start the application process. The case goes to one of nine Resettlement Support Centers stationed in different regions around the world.
UNHCR summarizes the U.S. role in resettling refugees. Click to enlarge.
Who does the security screening and where does it take place?
Staff members at Resettlement Support Centers travel to where applicants are staying to conduct face-to-face interviews, cross-reference their personal information and enter the data into the State Department’s Refugee Admission Processing System.
Officers from the Department of Homeland Security’s U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services review the information, interview the applicants again and take their fingerprints.
U.S. agencies, including the National Counterterrorism Center, FBI, Department of Homeland Security, Department of Defense, and Department of State, along with the intelligence community, conduct security checks including running the fingerprints through:
The security checks can expire if the overall vetting process takes too long. Any expired steps must be repeated if the applicant is still being vetted, Krause said.
The agencies are looking for potential security threats, including “connections to known bad actors, and past immigration or criminal violations,” according to the State Department’s website.
For refugees from Syria, DHS conducts additional reviews and collects additional biometric data, including iris scans, according to the department’s U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants.
The average length of time to process a refugee is 18-24 months, but it can take longer depending on the person’s nationality or their location. For example, people in certain refugee camps are more difficult to reach, and the rainy season in Africa may cause delays, Krause said.
Once the refugees clear security and are approved to enter the U.S., they undergo health screenings by the Department of Health and Human Services to make sure they do not have contagious diseases such as tuberculosis. If they do, they are treated and then undergo the health screening again.
The International Organization for Migration handles their travel logistics.
When refugees enter the United States, resettlement offices around the U.S. help them locate housing and jobs. The Pew Research Center tracked where the refugees came from by region since 1975:
Did people in charge of vetting get laid off under the new administration? What happens to the investigations that were already underway?
The executive order set a 50,000 cap on the total number of refugees allowed in the United States. If that ceiling remains in the rewritten order, the Resettlement Support Centers — along with other agencies that partner with the State Department to conduct the vetting — will face layoffs due to the decrease in refugee arrivals, said Krause.
The 50,000 maximum is down from last year’s target of 85,000 refugees (84,995 arrived). The target set by the Obama administration for this year was 110,000 refugees to resettle in the U.S.
So far this fiscal year, more than 30,000 refugees have arrived in the U.S.
The investigations already underway will continue. Whether the Resettlement Support Centers can take on any new cases depends on the regional targets set by the Presidential Determination, Krause said.

Two years later, he has a steady job and his family is doing well. But on one important matter — reuniting with his adult son, who is waiting in Jordan to come to the U.S. — things are more uncertain than ever.
Al Qadri said he had hoped that once his family members in the U.S. – his wife, two daughters and two sons – all got their green cards, they would be able to get Ahmed, who has been living in Jordan since the family escaped the fighting in Syria, to join them. But once they received their green cards, he learned it could still take years to reunite with his son.
“He’s a young man in his 20s and he wants to start his life, get married,” Al Qadri, still not 100 percent confident in his own English, recently said through an interpreter. “I don’t know if he can just sit and wait for years and years for something unknown, like whether we can bring him or not. I really don’t know what’s going to happen next.”

“I will get married this summer if I can travel (to Jordan). I am scared that I can’t, because I’m Syrian,” she said. Even with a green card, she’s worried she wouldn’t be able to get back into the U.S. because of a new executive order, and has no idea what her husband would do.

Sheila Mastropietro, director of the Church World Service’s Immigration and Refugee Program in Lancaster, which helped resettle the Al Qadris, said one of the State Department’s priorities is to keep families together. Spouses, unmarried children under age 21, and parents of asylum-seekers and refugees can get priority in the resettlement program, once DNA confirms the relation.
She said refugees who have resettled in the area have been calling her office wondering what will become of their family members living abroad. “They’re scared. They’re asking about ‘my parents, my sister, my brother, are they going to come?’”
On Jan. 27, President Donald Trump signed an executive order putting a 120-day hold on the refugee resettlement program, including an indefinite hold on Syrian refugees. A federal judge in Washington state has stopped the ban for now. The Department of Justice is fighting the ruling. Oral arguments before a federal appeals panel are scheduled for Tuesday.
President Trump issued the executive order to protect American citizens and keep potential terrorists out of the U.S., he has said. According to the order, some countries, namely Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen, are not providing adequate information for screening purposes.
The seven named countries “in my view, don’t have the kind of law enforcement, records keeping … that can convince us that one of their citizens is indeed who that citizen says they are and what their background might be,” said Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly at a Jan. 31 press briefing.
Additional vetting measures could include looking up websites the applicants visit, telephone contact information to see who they’re talking to, and reviewing their social media accounts, said Kelly. “We are developing what additional vetting — extreme vetting — might look like,” he said.
Watch the full briefing with Kelly and other homeland and border security officials.
While opponents of the ban — who include former secretaries of state John Kerry and Madeleine Albright — say refugees already undergo a lengthy, intensive screening process, others contend that something more must be done with threats of terrorism at home and abroad on the rise.
A Gallup poll said 42 percent of Americans approved of a temporary ban for the seven named countries and 36 percent approved of indefinitely suspending the Syrian refugee program.
A Quinnipiac poll had a higher number, showing 48 percent of American voters support “suspending immigration from terror-prone regions, even if it means turning away refugees.”
Steven Childers, 42, a disabled Marine veteran who lives in Riverside, California, said he backs President Trump’s efforts “100 percent.”
“I think he’s going on the advisements of his military and the people that know best how to defend this country,” Childers said. “I think by him doing this will keep … us a little bit safer from people getting in the country and carrying out these attacks.
“Not all Muslims, but the Muslim extremists, they hate Americans, they hate Christians, and they just want to do us harm,” he said. By signing the order, “it gives [President Trump] time and the military time to strategize how we’re going to deal with these people that quite frankly just want to kill us.”
Childers said the mainstream media should report on radical Muslims but also what most Muslims are really like, just regular people, some of whom he met at his son’s basketball game. “Two of the boys were Muslim and they were two of the best players on the team,” he said. “I sat and talked to (one boy’s) dad during the game and told him how good his son was, and he was really proud of his son.”
Advocacy groups are trying to educate the public about who the refugees are, where they come from and why they left their homes.
“Once they have an opportunity to look and understand what goes into the vetting of refugees, they’ll have a much better understanding of who these refugees are,” said Erol Kekic, executive director of Church World Service’s Immigration and Refugee Program.

Church World Service, one of nine resettlement agencies in the U.S., started a campaign this year called Greater as 1 to introduce visitors to some of the refugees and provide options to help.
“We have seen a great deal of support coming forward saying, we do want refugees here, they make our nation better and we want to continue to be the one nation in the world that will lead by example,” said Kekic. “We want to harness that support of communities around the United States who are still standing in solidarity with refugees.”
Other online petitions and calls to action have cropped up as well, including an Evangelical-led campaign called We Welcome Refugees, an Amnesty International effort called No Refugee-Bashing in My Name, and an online petition signed by thousands of academics and dozens of Nobel laureates.
Maha Al Qadri said she feels terrible for the Iraqis, Yemenis and citizens from the other countries named in the temporary ban who are looking to come to the U.S. Without knowing first-hand, as she does, how welcoming Americans can be, “they must think, ‘people hate me’,” she said."

It was not clear why they were returned a day after a U.S. court order blocked Trump’s ban on travelers and immigrants from seven predominantly Muslim countries, including Somalia. Officials with the International Organization for Migration, which runs the transit center in Nairobi where the refugees had been waiting for their flights to the U.S., could not be reached for comment.
“How would you feel? One day you are telling friends bye, wishing them well, and the next you are back where you started,” 28-year-old Nadir Hassan told The Associated Press by phone from the camp. “My home for 27 years was a refugee camp. I was hoping to start a new life in the U.S., get an education, a job, a life. We feel bad.”
He had been on a waiting list to leave for about a decade, he said.
The fate of the Somali refugees is especially uncertain because Kenya’s government has vowed to close their Dadaab camp, the world’s largest, by the end of May, citing security concerns. Kenyan officials say the refugees will be returned to neighboring Somalia, where the al-Qaida-linked al-Shabab extremist group continues to carry out deadly attacks in the capital, Mogadishu, and elsewhere.
The Kenyan government says al-Shabab uses Dadaab as a recruiting and training ground for extremists who attack Kenya, but it has not presented any proof.
Human rights groups have protested Kenya’s plans to close Dadaab, saying some of the more than 250,000 refugees there have reported being pressured to leave the camp and that Somalia remains too unstable for people to return home. Refugees who have heeded Kenya’s call to voluntarily leave have said they felt betrayed because assurances of safety and support went unfulfilled in Somalia.
A spokeswoman for the U.N. refugee agency, Yvonne Ndege, said Saturday the agency was looking at other ways of settling the refugees, including moving them to another camp in Kenya, Kakuma, which houses mostly people from South Sudan."

A look at what’s at stake.
AUSTRALIA DOESN’T WANT BOAT REFUGEES

Under the Obama administration, the U.S. agreed to resettle a group of refugees who are being held at detention camps on the impoverished Pacific island nations of Nauru and Papua New Guinea.

The Australian government pays both countries to house the refugees, because it refuses to settle any of them in Australia. That has resulted in many of them languishing inside the detention facilities for years. The conditions at the camps are grim and reports of detainees suffering abuse and attempting suicide are frequent.
UNCLEAR HOW MANY ARE GENUINE REFUGEES
President Donald Trump has repeatedly described the refugees as “illegal immigrants” and said in a tweet that there are “thousands” of them. The refugees are, in fact, among around 1,250 asylum seekers who were transferred to the island detention centers after being intercepted while trying to reach Australia by boat.
Another 370 who came to Australia for medical treatment and then refused to return to the islands are also eligible for resettlement to the United States. Australia will not say how many of the asylum seekers have been deemed genuine refugees, and thus it’s unclear exactly how many refugees the U.S. agreed to ultimately accept.
Most of the asylum seekers come from the Middle East, Africa and Asia. Australia’s previous center-left government called them “irregular maritime arrivals,” because a refugee can legally seek asylum in a country such as Australia that is a signatory to the United Nations Refugee Convention — which calls on nations to take in people fleeing war.
The current conservative government changed the terminology to “illegal maritime arrivals,” presumably because people smuggling is illegal and most pay people smugglers to ferry them to Australia.
THEIR PREFERED DESTINATION IS AUSTRALIA

Asylum seekers who attempt to reach Australia by boat generally travel to Indonesia, where people smugglers jam them into overcrowded, barely seaworthy vessels that then head south to Australia.

In 2013, Australia imposed tough policies toward asylum seekers in a bid to discourage the dangerous and often deadly journeys. Under the strict rules, any asylum seeker who tries to reach Australia by boat can never be settled in Australia, and is instead sent to the detention camps on Nauru and Papua New Guinea where their refugee claims are assessed. Prior to the U.S. deal, the only option given to those deemed genuine refugees was for them to resettle in Papua New Guinea or Cambodia.
Few refugees have accepted those offers, opting instead to remain in detention in the hopes that Australia will eventually take them in.
CONTRADICTING STATEMENTS
Over the weekend, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull and Trump had a tense telephone call in which they discussed the agreement.
On Monday, Turnbull told Australians that Trump had vowed during the call to honor the deal. But a report from The Washington Post that subsequently emerged suggested the agreement might be in doubt.
The newspaper reported that during the call, Trump ranted to Turnbull that it was “the worst deal ever.” Shortly after that report was published, Trump took to Twitter to slam the agreement as “dumb” and said he would review it. Meanwhile, the State Department offered reassurance that the agreement would, in fact, stand — “out of respect for close ties to our Australian ally and friend.”
Do you believe it? The Obama Administration agreed to take thousands of illegal immigrants from Australia. Why? I will study this dumb deal!

White House spokesman Sean Spicer also confirmed that Trump had agreed to honor the deal, though he said all the refugees would be subjected to “extreme vetting.”
Later, Trump told reporters that he has to “respect” actions of the previous administration, yet quickly added: “But you can also say, ‘Why are we doing this?'”
Spicer then gave another press conference in which he said that Trump was “unbelievably disappointed” in the agreement and had “agreed to continue to review that deal.”
On Thursday, a Trump administration official described the president as “very strong” in the phone call with Turnbull and said it had ended early, after about 30 minutes.
But on Friday, Trump tweeted, “Thank you to Prime Minister of Australia for telling the truth about our very civil conversation that FAKE NEWS media lied about. Very nice!”

A federal judge suspended Trump’s executive order on immigration, allowing visitors from the seven countries that had been banned to enter. In a statement, she told the NewsHour that attending the Oscars is bittersweet, because she used to stay up late every year to watch the award show with her husband, who is now presumed dead. But she said traveling to the U.S. was deeply important, “to have the opportunity to reach so many people with my message of peace” and “to tell the world about a small country called Syria, a country that has been burnt alive.”
For three years, documentary filmmaker Marcel Mettelsiefen followed one Syrian family: Hala Kamil, her husband Abu Ali, a commander in the Free Syrian Army, and their four young children: Sara, Farah, Helen and Mohammed. Their story — of violence, escape to safety, and adjusting to a new life in Germany — became the film “Watani: My Homeland,” nominated this year for an Oscar.
Hala was planning to attend the award ceremony later this month, along with a Women in the World Summit for female leaders in Washington, D.C. But since President Donald Trump’s executive order on immigration, Mettelsiefen said that no longer seems possible, despite Hala’s visa, which is valid until 2019. And now, she’s speaking out.
In a statement given to PBS NewsHour, Hala said she agreed to be filmed so that people could “see the truth and harsh reality” refugees face, and that she felt a duty to use her story and platform to bring attention to the people still trapped in Syria. “Being able to stand up on a world stage and address people worldwide,” as she might have at the Oscars or the Women in the World conference, “is very important in [that] mission,” she said.
In addition to Hala, the executive order that temporarily bans travel from seven countries may also prevent the White Helmets, a Syrian volunteer rescue group that appears in another Oscar-nominated documentary, from attending the ceremony. Meanwhile, an unknown number of foreign nationals who lived and studied in the U.S. for years do not know when and if they will be able to return, and the fate of some 20,000 refugees remains in limbo.
The State Department, which manages the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program, referred questions about the order and its impact on refugees to the White House. On Wednesday, in a separate interview with the NewsHour, Vice President Mike Pence defended the executive order more generally as a “pause” so that vetting procedures could be improved.
“President Trump has no higher priority than the safety and security of the American people,” he said, citing the example of the November 2015 terror attack in Paris, where it was initially believed that one of the attackers had a Syrian refugee passport. That passport later turned out to be fake, but intelligence officials have warned that extremists have considered exploiting refugee programs to enter the U.S.
“It’s very sad to see one of the biggest [and] most influential countries in the world close its heart to people,” Hala said. “Refugees are humans first and foremost. They are mothers and fathers, sons and daughters.”
When the film begins, Hala’s family of six is the only one remaining in a warzone area of Aleppo — and they vow to stay. But when her husband Abu Ali gets captured by ISIS, and the violence continues to escalate around them, Hala must make the difficult decision to leave Syria for the safety of her children. As they arrive in their new home, a small town in Germany called Goslar, Hala gazes out the window and murmurs: “There isn’t a single shelled house.”
In considering the travel ban, Mettelsiefen, who is German but has been traveling to Syria since 2011, said it is important to remember that choosing to leave home is not a decision most refugees want to make. Hala and Abu Ali wanted to stay and fight for Syria, as did their children, despite living amid constant shelling.
“We love you, Syria,” Sara, Hala’s youngest child, says in the film as they leave Aleppo for Germany. “Forgive us.”
In her statement, Hala said, “We don’t become refugees because it’s the easiest thing to do; we become refugees because the only other choice is death.”
Almost 5 million Syrians — or half the country’s population — have fled the country since the conflict began in 2011. Some half a million people have died.
(Their story was also shown on FRONTLINE, as the television documentary, “Children of Syria,” which was honored with a duPont Award last month.)
But while children can more easily adapt to life in a new country, Mettelsiefen said he has found that is more difficult for parents like Hala.
“While the older generation will physically be there, they will never be able to really leave their homeland,” he said. In her statement, Hala said in leaving Syria means she now has to live with “great sadness and great guilt.”
At a speech in August before the United Nations, Hala warned in stark terms that Aleppo, her beloved hometown, was burning, but the world had stopped paying attention. Aleppo, which is Syria’s largest city, was once a bustling metropolis; now, it’s been largely reduced to rubble.
“My homeland is bleeding profusely and the world is yet to tend to its wounds,” she said.
Hala also told the UN that as the Syrian people called out for help, the world was otherwise fixated on “images of knife-wielding terrorists killing in the name of Islam.”
“Well, not in our name. Not in my name,” she said. The crowd burst into applause.
“She gave this unbelievable speech at the [UN] General Assembly,” said Mettelsiefen, “giving a voice and face to all these refugees… as a strong, female Muslim woman.”
This was important, he said, because it shows a different and more human side to the Arab world than “the endless rows of bearded men chopping off heads” often shown in the media. Mettelsiefen believes the travel ban, which restricts immigration from seven Muslim-majority countries, only further feeds that narrative.
“To shape the future by and with hate, fear, and division is very dangerous,” he said. “I’m German, we’ve been there, and it didn’t end well.”
Just four months after Hala’s speech, Aleppo fell to President Bashar al-Assad’s forces. And the five-year-long civil war continues. In recent months, little news has gotten out of Syria, which remains the most dangerous country for journalists. But in December, the United Nations voiced concern that more than 100,000 civilians were trapped, and this week media reported cease-fire talks between the government and rebel factions were shaky.
“Syria is still burning, its people are being suffocated,” Hala said in her statement. “Millions of men, women and children are in need of desperate help. Time is running out.”

Caldwell, Associated Press","872 refugees will be allowed into the U.S. this week, despite immigration ban","WASHINGTON — The Trump administration said 872 refugees will be allowed into the United States this week despite a presidential order suspending the U.S. refugees program.
Kevin McAleenan, the acting head of Customs and Border Protection, said Tuesday that the refugees were already traveling and stopping them would cause “undue hardship.” Their admission comes despite President Donald Trump’s warnings that refugees like these, vetted under the Obama administration, were not adequately screened to ensure they are not potential terrorists.
The refugee ban was part of an executive order signed Friday by Trump that has stoked outrage and protests. Besides the 120-day ban for refugees, the order also bans entry to the United States from citizens of seven majority Muslim countries and indefinitely bars travel by Syrians to the U.S.
At a news briefing with McAleenan, Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly said the travel ban for the seven countries may be extended and other countries could also be added to the list.
“I would be less than honest if I told you that some of those countries that are currently on the list may not be taken off the list anytime soon,” Kelly said. “They’re countries that are in various states of collapse” and may not be able to verify that people applying to come to the United States are who they say they are.
WATCH: Homeland Security Sec. John Kelly addresses immigration ban
In his first briefing with reporters since he was confirmed, Kelly defended Trump’s order and said its intention is to keep would-be terrorist out of the United States and not serve as a ban on Muslims. Early in his campaign, Trump had called for a ban on Muslims entering the United States.
Kelly said “the vast majority of the 1.7 billion Muslims that live on this planet, the vast majority of them have, all other things being equal, have access to the United States.”
The retired Marine general also said the order was “not a travel ban” but a “temporary pause that allows us to better review the existing refugee and visa- vetting system.”
White House Sean Spicer made that point too in his daily briefing to reporters. But Trump referred to it as a “ban” in a tweet Tuesday defending the decision not to provide advanced notice to travelers. Spicer also called it a ban on Monday.
“If the ban were announced with a one week notice, the ‘bad’ would rush into our country during that week,” Trump wrote. “A lot of bad ‘dudes’ out there!”
The rollout of the order has been widely criticized, a point McAlleenan conceded, saying communication among government agencies had “not been the best.”
But he said the refugees’ waivers were being done in concert with the State Department. He said the refugees would be processed through the end of the week.
According to guidance provided to some refugee aid agencies by the State Department none of the refugees are from the seven countries singled out for an all-out travel ban. Those countries are Syria, Iran, Iraq, Somalia, Sudan, Yemen and Libya.
Kelly denied reports that he had been out of the loop in the White House planning for the immigration restrictions.
Kelly told reporters he looked at two drafts of the order before the Friday signing and that high-level government lawyers and agency officials were involved in drafting it. He didn’t provide names of who was involved in the initial planning, but said the group included people from Trump’s transition team. Kelly also said he knew the order was coming because Trump had long talked about it as a candidate.
People who know Kelly, however, told The Associated Press that he was not aware of the details in the directive until around the time that Trump signed it."

In a statement, the White House said Yate “betrayed the Department of Justice by refusing to enforce a legal order designed to protect the citizens of the United States,” adding that the executive order was approved by the department’s legal counsel.
“Ms. Yates is an Obama Administration appointee who is weak on borders and very weak on illegal immigration,” the statement continued.
The White House named attorney Dana Boente to serve as acting attorney general until Senator Jeff Sessions is fully confirmed by the Senate.
Original story:
WASHINGTON — Acting Attorney General Sally Yates, a Democratic appointee, on Monday directed Justice Department attorneys not to defend President Donald Trump’s controversial executive refugee and immigration ban, joining a growing group of administration officials distancing themselves from the new president’s order.
Her directive was likely to be temporary, given that Sen. Jeff Sessions, Trump’s pick for attorney general, will likely move to uphold the president’s policy. Sessions is awaiting Senate confirmation.
Still, it set up a dramatic standoff between a president and his own Justice Department just days into his tenure.
“I am responsible for ensuring that the positions we take in court remain consistent with this institution’s solemn obligation to always seek justice and stand for what is right,” Yates wrote in a letter announcing her position. “At present, I am not convinced that the defense of the Executive Order is consistent with these responsibilities nor am I convinced that the Executive Order is lawful.”

Trump responded Monday by accusing Democrats of delaying approval of his Cabinet nominees for political reasons. “Now have an Obama A.G.,” the president wrote on Twitter.
The Senate Judiciary Committee is expected to approve Sessions’ nomination Tuesday and he could be approved by the full Senate soon after.
Yates’ abrupt decision deepened the discord and dissent surrounding Trump’s order, which temporarily halted the entire U.S. refugee program and banned all entries from seven Muslim-majority nations for 90 days. As protests erupted at airports over the weekend and confusion disrupted travel around the globe, some of Trump’s top advisers and fellow Republicans privately noted they were not consulted about the policy.
At least three top national security officials — Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly and Rex Tillerson, who is awaiting confirmation to lead the State Department — have told associates they were not aware of details of directive until around the time Trump signed it. Leading intelligence officials were also left largely in the dark, according to U.S. officials.
Tennessee Sen. Bob Corker, the top Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations committee, said that despite White House assurances that congressional leaders were consulted, he learned about the order in the media.
Other parts of Trump’s administration were voicing dissent Monday. A large group of American diplomats circulated a memo voicing their opposition to the order, which temporarily halted the entire U.S. refugee program and banned all entries from seven Muslim-majority nations for 90 days. In a startlingly combative response, White House spokesman Sean Spicer challenged those opposed to the measure to resign.
“They should either get with the program or they can go,” Spicer said.
The blowback underscored Trump’s tenuous relationship with his own national security advisers, many of whom he met for the first time during the transition, as well as with the government bureaucracy he now leads. While Trump outlined his plan for temporarily halting entry to the U.S. from countries with terror ties during the campaign, the confusing way in which it finally was crafted stunned some who have joined his team.
Mattis, who stood next to Trump during Friday’s signing ceremony, is said to be particularly incensed. A senior U.S. official said Mattis, along with Joint Chiefs Chairman Joseph Dunford, was aware of the general concept of Trump’s order but not the details. Tillerson has told the president’s political advisers that he was baffled over not being consulted on the substance of the order.
U.S. officials and others with knowledge of the Cabinet’s thinking insisted on anonymity in order to disclose the officials’ private views.
Trump’s order pauses America’s entire refugee program for four months and indefinitely bans all those from war-ravaged Syria. Federal judges in New York and several other states issued orders that temporarily block the government from deporting people with valid visas who arrived after Trump’s travel ban took effect.
The president has privately acknowledged flaws in the rollout, according to a person with knowledge of his thinking. But he’s also blamed the media — his frequent target — for what he believes are reports exaggerating the dissent and the number of people actually affected.
Trump has also said he believes the voters who carried him to victory support the plan as a necessary step to safeguard the nation. And he’s dismissed objectors as attention-seeking rabble-rousers and grandstanding politicians.
After a chaotic weekend during which some U.S. legal permanent residents were detained at airports, some agencies were moving swiftly to try to clean up after the White House.
Homeland Security, the agency tasked with implementing much of the refugee ban, clarified that customs and border agents should allow legal residents to enter the country. The Pentagon was trying to exempt Iraqis who worked alongside the U.S. and coalition forces from the 90-day ban on entry from the predominantly Muslim countries.
“There are a number of people in Iraq who have worked for us in a partnership role, whether fighting alongside us or working as translators, often doing so at great peril to themselves,” said Navy Capt. Jeff Davis, a Pentagon spokesman.
Policies with such broad reach are typically vetted by affected agencies and subject to review by multiple agencies. It’s a process that can be frustratingly slow but is aimed at avoiding unintended consequences.
On Capitol Hill, lawmakers in Trump’s party sought to distance themselves from the wide-ranging order.
While Spicer said “appropriate committees and leadership offices” on Capitol Hill were consulted, GOP lawmakers said their offices had no hand in drafting the order and no briefings from the White House on how it would work.
“I think they know that it could have been done in a better way,” Corker said of the White House.
Some Trump supporters defended the president, saying his actions should not have come as a surprise given his positions during the campaign.
“Nothing he did over the weekend was new,” said Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker and an informal adviser. He conceded that coordination could have been better, but he said Trump’s vow to quickly bring change to Washington will sometimes mean he needs to prioritize fast action over broad consultation.
“If you’re the reformer, you need the momentum,” Gingrich said.

But the order itself was not posted on the official website, WH.gov, for the public to read for three days.
“I think a lot of people have not read exactly what the order says,” Press Secretary Sean Spicer said on Monday, roughly two hours after the order was made available to the public on the White House website. “[Critics] are basing their opinion on misguided media reports.”
The official order, “Protecting the nation from foreign terrorist entry into the United States,” was signed last Friday, along with a separate Trump directive on rebuilding the military.
Neither appeared on the White House webpage of executive actions until midday on Monday, when the order on refugees was published on the site.
It did not appear to be an issue of weekend workflow. Orders signed on Saturday were up on the webpage within hours that day.
When asked the reason for the delay, White House Senior Assistant Press Secretary Michael Short told the NewsHour on Monday that it was “a vendor issue.” The White House did not respond immediately to further questions.
The lack of a public posting of the order came during days of intense attention on the president’s action and confusion over exactly what it proscribed.
President Trump signed the order at 4:42 p.m EST, forcing federal officials to scramble to implement the policy over the weekend.
The White House emailed the specific language of the order to the media just over two hours later, before 7 p.m. EST on Friday — some 60-plus hours before the full text was made available online."

“We understand that as Canadians we are almost all immigrants, and that no one should be excluded on the basis of their ethnicity or nationality,” Tory said in a statement.
Trump signed a sweeping executive order Friday that he billed as a necessary step to stop “radical Islamic terrorists” from coming to the U.S. Included is a 90-day ban on travel to the U.S. by citizens of Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia or Yemen and a 120-day suspension of the U.S. refugee program.
Trump’s order singled out Syrians for the most aggressive ban, ordering that anyone from that country, including those fleeing civil war, are indefinitely blocked from coming to the United States.
The Syrian refugee crisis became a major issue in Canada’s election in late 2015 because of the haunting image of a drowned 3-year-old Syrian boy washed up on a Turkish beach. The boy had relatives in Canada.

After meeting Saturday, the foreign ministers of both nations, Jean-Marc Ayrault and Germany’s Sigmar Gabriel, said they want to meet with Rex Tillerson, Trump’s nominee for secretary of state who is still awaiting confirmation.
Ayrault said Trump’s order on Friday that bars all refugees from entering the United States for four months — and those from war-ravaged Syria indefinitely — “can only worry us.”
“We have signed international obligations, so welcoming refugees fleeing war and oppression forms part of our duties,” the French minister said.
“There are many other issues that worry us,” he added. “That is why Sigmar and I also discussed what we are going to do. When our colleague, Tillerson, is officially appointed, we will both contact him.”
Gabriel — on his first trip abroad since his appointment Friday — said offering refuge to the persecuted and those fleeing death are western values that Europe and the United States share.
“Love thy neighbor is part of this tradition, the act of helping others,” he said. “This unites us, we Westerners. And I think that this remains a common foundation that we share with the United States, one we aim to promote.”
Trump declared the ban necessary to prevent “radical Islamic terrorists” from entering the United States.
The order immediately suspended a program that last year resettled to the U.S. roughly 85,000 people displaced by war, political oppression, hunger and religious prejudice."

His dreams of a better life were crushed when President Donald Trump issued an indefinite ban on displaced Syrians entering the United States.
Sawan said Saturday that he learned of the decision from TV news the night before.
“When we heard of the order, it was like a bolt of lightning, and all our hopes and dreams vanished,” said Sawan, 40.
The upholsterer, who supports his family with odd jobs in the Jordanian capital of Amman, said he was especially disappointed for his four children who he had hoped would get a good education in the U.S.
He and other Syrian refugees in Amman bristled at the idea that they posed a potential security threat, saying they were both shocked and saddened by Trump’s ban.
“We tell the American people that we hope he (Trump) retracts this decision,” said refugee Mayada Sheik, 37. “We are not going out to harm people of other countries.”
READ NEXT: Does limiting refugees deter terrorism?
In an executive order Friday, Trump suspended all refugee admissions to the U.S. for four months and banned the entry of Syrian refugees indefinitely, pending a security review of the admissions program. In a third step, he issued a 90-day ban on all entry to the U.S. from countries with terrorism concerns, including Syria, Iraq and Libya.
Close to 5 million Syrians have fled their homeland since the conflict there erupted in 2011. Millions more are displaced within Syria.
Most refugees have settled in overburdened neighboring countries, including Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey where the struggle for survival has become increasingly difficult. Savings have run out, jobs are scarce and poorly paid, while refugee children learn in crowded classrooms and have very limited access to higher education.
Many refugees say their first choice is to return home as soon as possible. But with the civil war dragging on, that’s not an option and refugees increasingly pursue resettlement to the West because of tough conditions in regional host countries.
International aid agencies harshly criticized Trump’s restrictions imposed on refugees.
The International Rescue Committee said the suspension of the refugee resettlement program was a “harmful and hasty” decision. “America must remain true to its core values. America must remain a beacon of hope,” said IRC President David Miliband.
The group said the U.S. vetting process for refugees is already robust — involving biometric screening and up to 36 months of vetting by 12 to 15 government agencies.
Jan Egeland, the head of the Norwegian Refugee Council, said Trump’s decision hurts innocents fleeing extremist violence in Syria.
“It will not make America safer,” Egeland told The Associated Press in a phone interview from Norway. “It will make America smaller and meaner. It’s a really sad rupture of a long and proud American bi-partisan tradition that America would be there for those fleeing from terror and for the weak and the vulnerable in the world, which are the refugees.”
The NRC is a leading refugee aid agency, assisting more than 1 million Syrians.

The order:
The order implements “new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America. We don’t want them here,” President Trump said at the Pentagon after former Gen. James Mattis was officially sworn in as defense secretary.
“We want to ensure that we are not admitting into our country the very threats our soldiers are fighting overseas. We only want to admit those into our country who will support our country and love deeply our people,” he said.
The full text of the order, released later Friday night, says the secretaries of State and Homeland Security may still decide to admit individual refugees on a case-by-case basis — if it would not “pose a risk to the security or welfare of the United States” — under certain conditions:
This comes days after Mr. Trump delivered on another campaign promise: an executive order that directs agencies to begin planning and identify funding for a wall along the U.S. Border with Mexico.
The president signed another executive order Friday to rebuild the nation’s armed forces, including plans for new planes, ships and other resources for service members, he said.

When word of the refugee ban came out this week, religious leaders and refugee advocates rallied against the order, saying it goes against America’s history and values.
“At a time when millions of people around the world have fled their homes because of violence, we must remember our country’s proud history: The United States is a beacon of freedom and hope for all people regardless of race, religion or nationality,” said Neal Keny-Guyer, chief executive officer of Mercy Corps.
Of all the groups allowed entry into the U.S., refugees are the most scrutinized, said Erol Kekic, who leads the Immigration and Refugee Program at the Church World Service, one of the country’s main refugee resettlement groups.
“We know who they are, where they’re coming from, we have their biometric and security information,” he said. “Our program is very orderly and secure.”
The current refugee screening process takes about 18 to 24 months, according to the State Department, which manages the nine U.S. centers around the world that prepare refugee applications for review.
Has this ever been done before?
According ABC News, the State Department temporarily stopped processing Iraqi refugees for six months in 2011 after the FBI found evidence linking two Iraqis living in Kentucky to bomb-making devices in Iraq. The pause was reportedly aimed at giving the FBI time to fingerprint more bombing equipment.
The State Department press office this week did not confirm the pause in processing in 2011, though a search on its Worldwide Refugee Admissions Processing System showed that Iraqi refugees who already had been processed continued to enter the U.S. that year.
Politico reported on another instance when the State Department suspended the U.S. refugee program for Iraqis: It shut down in 2014 for about a year while Iraqi forces were fighting Islamic State militants. The program reportedly reopened in April 2015.
Will a pause in the process work?
Many think the ban will force some improvements, including House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Michael McCaul, R-Texas, who co-sponsored legislation in the last Congress that would add the FBI to the U.S. agencies screening refugees. It passed the House but not the Senate.
Currently, the U.S. refugee admissions program involves the Department of State, the Department of Homeland Security, and the Department of Health and Human Services.
“We are a compassionate nation and a country of immigrants,” McCaul said in a statement. “But as we know, terrorists are dead set on using our immigration and refugee programs as a Trojan Horse to attack us. Today, President Trump signed an order to help prevent jihadists from infiltrating the United States. With the stroke of a pen, he is doing more to shut down terrorist pathways into this country than the last administration did in eight years.
“As chairman of the Homeland Security Committee, I will ensure the appropriate steps are taken to tighten immigration and refugee screening. And in the long run, I will work with the White House to make sure the United States remains both a beacon of hope — open to all freedom-loving people — and a nation well-defended against all who wish to do it harm,” McCaul said.
In a series of tweets, Jay Sekulow, chief counsel of the American Center for Law and Justice, praised President Trump’s executive order, saying “From San Bernardino to Orlando, it’s clear that jihad is in America. We must destroy it once and for all.”

Refugee advocates, however, don’t agree with the president’s approach.
“The United States is the wealthiest country on the planet. The size and strength of its military are unparalleled. Yet by considering denying safe haven to refugees the Trump administration adopts a posture of fear more appropriate for a weak and powerless state,” said Joel Charny, director of Norwegian Refugee Council USA.
“Not only will this order put significant numbers of individuals fleeing conflict and persecution at immediate risk, but also it will harm our relations around the world,” said Michelle Nunn, CEO of CARE. “Frontline states, such as Jordan, struggle to keep their borders open to millions of people just trying to survive. Should the U.S. not live up to our humanitarian commitments, we could foreseeably compromise relationships vital to our national interests.”
The National Iranian American Council issued a statement saying it too wanted to help protect America from terror, “but a blanket ban based on national origin does nothing to achieve that objective.”
“Even if this were the right approach,” the statement continued, “it is notable that the list doesn’t include Saudi Arabia and would have done nothing to prevent 9/11 or the other terrorist attacks committed by radical Wahhabi jihadists in the U.S.”
Rather than blocking refugees, the U.S. should direct its energies toward helping address the capacity of terrorist groups to inspire lone-wolf attacks, Kekic said. “It’s not a refugee or migration issue. It’s a fundamental inequality issue that we need to combat together. To try to pin some of the negative or terrorist actions of individuals onto entire groups of people is a dangerous precedent.”
Catholic Relief Services, which “strongly opposes this move,” said in a statement that “a religious test against Muslims today can be a religious test against Christians tomorrow.”
Will the U.S. hit its refugee target?
Until this point, the United States appeared to be on track to fulfilling the Obama administration goal of bringing 110,000 refugees to the U.S. during the current fiscal year, according to a Jan. 20 report from the Pew Research Center.
Since October — the start of the current fiscal year — about 30,000 refugees have entered the U.S., according to the State Department’s Refugee Processing Center.
The previous year, the U.S. resettled nearly 85,000 refugees, 46 percent of whom were Muslim, reported the Pew Research Center.
The Obama administration also raised the goal for admitting Syrian refugees to 10,000. In previous years, it was around 1,500. By the end of the last fiscal year, more than 13,000 Syrians had arrived in the U.S.
President Trump’s executive order says no more than 50,000 refugees may enter the U.S. in fiscal year 2017, until he determines that admitting more “would be in the national interest.”
This story was updated with a link to the executive order, posted on the White House’s website on Monday. We will continue tracking the refugee resettlement issue as it develops."

For three minutes, the 22-year-old Syrian refugee spoke for millions of people who, like him, are “stateless and stuck with no possibility of escaping the war,” he said in September.
“‘We are living on the edge of hell. We have been waiting for so long for the day that the world would hear our voice. I hope it is today,’” Badran said, quoting another Palestinian Syrian refugee named Zoher who asked that his last name be withheld.
Badran is one of 65 million refugees, asylum seekers and internally displaced people worldwide, driven from their home countries by violence and persecution, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. That’s more than the population of the United Kingdom, and the highest number since World War II.
And more than half of the world’s refugees have fled from three nations — the Syrian Arab Republic, Afghanistan and Somalia — according to the United Nations.
When the United Nations General Assembly met on Sept. 19, 193 countries agreed to protect refugees and migrants. The resulting declaration lays the foundation for world leaders to adopt a global refugee compact for “safe, orderly and regular migration” in 2018, said Christopher Boian, press officer for the U.N. refugee agency.
“It sends a very clear signal that business as usual is no longer an adequate response,” Boian said. “The world is now facing a refugee crisis of scope and nature that hasn’t been seen before. This is unprecedented.”
Outgoing U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon called the agreement a “breakthrough.”
But Bill Frelick, refugee program director at Human Rights Watch, is less enthusiastic about the New York Declaration for Refugees and Migrants. There’s no legal recourse if a nation backs out, and Frelick said what was missing from the string of speeches delivered by world leaders was a “sense of urgency.”
“The international community has basically veered between vapid pronouncements of solidarity,” he said, adding that scratching the surface of the rhetoric reveals a containment agenda designed to keep refugees and migrants as close to their home countries as possible.
“Putting an emphasis on orderly migration is not putting the rights of refugees and very vulnerable human beings at the forefront,” he said.
In two years, Badran doesn’t know what will remain of his war-torn home country. But he wants no one to mistake him for a victim “begging people to do something,” he said: “With you or without you, we are already doing something.”
Leaving a Mark
Helping people always made sense to Badran, even if it marked him as an oddball in Damascus.
When Badran was 12 years old, he volunteered to sort and shelve books. He later collected unwanted paper from his teachers, classmates and neighbors to recycle, filling huge bags he carried Santa Claus-style over his shoulder. He said his bewildered family would ask him: “It’s an unpaid job. Why are you wasting your time?” He never had a good answer, he said.
And then the Syrian civil war broke out. In December 2012, a Syrian warplane bombed Yarmouk, the Palestinian community in Damascus where his parents worked. They fled to a farm two hours away, leaving Badran behind to focus on his college classes in interior design. He still volunteered, but people began to threaten him for his humanitarian relief efforts with Syria Trust and the United Nations.
By June 2013, he decided it was too dangerous to stay in Syria. He was 19 years old.
“I did really do my best to help people inside, but I couldn’t do anything more,” he told the NewsHour. “I really want to leave a mark, and I didn’t want to just to die in a bomb or shooting guns or something. That was the main reason why I left. I felt like maybe I could do something more from outside.”
It took him five months to reach the Netherlands, and if you ask him what happened after he fled his homeland, he won’t go into specifics. A man seized his passport and smuggled him back and forth between Egypt and West Africa, including Ghana. Finally, Badran said he escaped, using a fake passport to board a commercial airplane in November 2013 that took him from Africa to Amsterdam Airport Schiphol.
The morning he landed in the Netherlands, Badran said he nervously told Dutch police officers he was a refugee who needed asylum. By that evening, he was moved into a crowded camp without a job, home, friends or family.
Syrians at the time already made up the largest portion of new asylum seekers in the Netherlands at 9 percent — trying to enter industrialized countries, including the United States, according to a recent report from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.
Since then, the number of Syrians applying for asylum within industrialized nations nearly tripled to 24 percent and remains the largest group seeking refuge within industrialized nations.
Picking Up the Pieces
In Amsterdam, Badran spent years rebuilding his life. For 10 hours a day, he sold pre-made sandwiches at Simit Sarayi, a chain of Turkish cafes, working his way up to manager after two months and then hiring three more Syrians. He learned enough Dutch to qualify for remedial college courses in early 2015 and earned enough money to rent an apartment. His parents eventually reunited with him. In September, he enrolled at Free University in Amsterdam.
Interior design classes no longer interested him. Bomb blasts had cratered Damascus, and civil war had driven him more than 2,600 miles from his hometown. For Badran, studying cultural anthropology and development became a more relevant choice.
So he began to volunteer again. He and fellow refugees created a nonprofit group, Syrian Volunteers in the Netherlands. Since registering in February, organizers paired Syrian refugees and native Dutch citizens who together completed household chores for elderly residents, cared for children with disabilities and tended public gardens.
More than 600 people have joined the organization, including refugees who want to “help out somehow” in their host country, even if they couldn’t do the same at home, Badran said. As tensions mount in Europe against refugees, Badran designed dialogue sessions where his nonprofit’s volunteers confront Syrian and Dutch stereotypes. He plans to expand his model to Germany and Sweden.
In November 2015, he met Attila Kulcsar, a humanitarian media officer at Oxfam International, at a documentary film festival in Amsterdam. Kulcsar later suggested Badran apply to speak before the United Nations General Assembly and mentored him.
Out of more than 400 applicants, Badran was selected in August. He had a month to prepare and three minutes to make the case for refugees to world leaders.
“I’m a bit worried about the message and delivering it. If you can help, that would be great,” he wrote Kulcsar in an Aug. 20 email in his typical reserved style.
For weeks, they drafted his speech and made countless revisions. Badran practiced, but his delivery was stiff and he stumbled over his words during rehearsal the day before the summit at the United Nations in New York City. In a nearby park, he and Kulcsar launched into an hours-long drama session to “help him reveal his power, reveal his emotion,” Kulcsar said.
The next morning, Badran walked confidently to the podium, but for a moment, he was overwhelmed. Hundreds of the most powerful people in the world looked back at him.
And then he spoke. His searing words demanded accountability and agreement “to end the violence now in Syria and protect civilians; to guarantee safe route for all refugees and to not put our lives on hold; to empower refugees to lead projects for refugees so that we can help our people.”
“It seems inaction is the only thing that the international community can agree on,” he said. “If world leaders today are unable to find a solution for the refugee crisis and the Syrian crisis, then this summit is no different from all other conferences.”

Supporting Themselves
Two months have passed since Badran gave his speech at the United Nations. College classes and volunteer work consume his time.
Syria remains besieged by war. The latest cease-fire talks fell apart. The World Health Organization recently reported 25,000 people are wounded each month, more than half of all public hospitals and primary care centers function in part or not at all. About two-thirds of all doctors and nurses are gone. This week, CNN aired video of hospitalized children choking to breathe after suspected gas attacks struck Aleppo.
Badran said such unmet needs fuel his desire to “empower refugees to come up with solutions and new ideas to support themselves.”
World leaders gave themselves two years to figure out how to help millions of refugees flee chaos. But Badran can’t wait that long."

The country’s interior minister Joseph Nkaissery told the Associated Press the deadline to shut down Dadaab and repatriate its inhabitants has been extended by six months. It was originally scheduled to close November 30.
The camp, located in the eastern part of Kenya, is home to more than 260,000 refugees, most of whom are Somalis, Human Rights Watch said in a statement.
The nonprofit group Amnesty International, along with other humanitarian organizations, have called on the Kenyan government to halt its plans.
“The refugees are caught between a rock and a hard place,” Amnesty International’s Michelle Kagari said in a statement earlier this week. “
Kenyan government officials are telling them they must leave by the end of the month or they will be forced to leave without any assistance,” she said.
The AP reported that some of the refugees have returned to Somalia, but their lives are still at risk and they could be forced into extremist group al-Shabab.
Citing security reasons, Kenya announced earlier this year it would close the camp. The country has been attacked several times by al-Shabab, and government officials are concerned the camp is being used to recruit militants.
The Kenyan government told AP it is abiding by international laws in its process to dissolve the camp.
The Dadaab camp was once the home of newly elected first muslim Somali-American state-representative, Ilhan Omar.

A three-judge panel for the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago on Monday agreed with an injunction a federal judge issued in February. The judge found Pence’s directive “clearly discriminates” against refugees from the war-torn nation.
The appeals court says federal law doesn’t allow a governor “to deport to other states immigrants he deems dangerous.”

Seeking to promote his father’s presidential campaign, the younger Trump posted a tweet featuring a bowl of the candy Skittles with a warning.
“If I had a bowl of skittles and I told you just three would kill you, would you take a handful?” said the tweet on the verified @DonaldTrumpJr handle.
“That’s our Syrian refugee problem,” said the post, which caused a stir and negative tweets on the internet into Tuesday.
Trump Jr.’s tweet said, “This image says it all. Let’s end the politically correct agenda that doesn’t put America first.”

His father has advocated sharply restraining immigration and has accused opponent Hillary Clinton of advocating acceptance of tens of thousands of refugees.
Skittles parent company, Wrigley Americas, distanced itself from the tweet with a terse response opposing Trump Jr.’s premise.
“Skittles are candy. Refugees are people. We don’t feel it’s an appropriate analogy,” Vice President of Corporate Affairs Denise Young said in the statement. “We will respectfully refrain from further commentary as anything we say could be misinterpreted as marketing.”

Trump Jr.’s tweet repeats an analogy that has been on the internet for years, using M&Ms and other foods, and targeting a variety of groups.
When former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee was running for the Republican presidential nomination last year, he used peanuts to warn about the risk of admitting refugees. In a Nov. 17 interview on MSNBC, he asked, if there was a five-pound bag of peanuts and “there were about 10 peanuts that were deadly poisonous, would you feed them to your kids? The answer is no.”
Trump Jr. has been generating some controversy lately. Last week, he made what some took as a Holocaust-themed joke in an interview with a Philadelphia radio station, referring to “warming up the gas chamber.” He has denied he was alluding to the Holocaust.
He also told the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review that it would be unwise for his father to release his tax returns because it would “distract” from his father’s “main message.” His father has repeatedly said the reason he has not released his returns is because they are being audited by the Internal Revenue Service.
Trump Jr.’s tweet came as world leaders meeting at the United Nations on Monday approved a declaration aimed at providing a more coordinated and humane response to the global refugee crisis, among which Syrians are a major grouping.
An estimated 65 million people worldwide are considered refugees and migrants. On Monday, the United Nations General Assembly’s began its first summit on the growing global issue. The session yielded an unprecedented declaration of commitment to organization and cooperation in supporting refugees. William Brangham interviews Filippo Grandi, UN High Commissioner for Refugees, about its importance.
During the campaign Trump has repeatedly called for a moratorium on accepting Syrian refugees. This is part of a more wide-ranging policy on immigrants that has ranged from an outright ban on foreign Muslim immigrants entering the United States “until we know what the hell is going on” to “extreme” vetting and an ideological test for would-be immigrants from countries and regions plagued by extremism.
Clinton has said she would expand President Barack Obama’s refugee program to accept about 65,000 Syrian refugees. This would be in addition to the tens of thousands of refugees accepted from around the world every year. Clinton said she would continue with the vetting currently in place, an effort that can take multiple years to complete.
Hundreds of thousands of Syrians have sought refuge in Europe while many others wait in neighboring countries and refugee camps for the war to end or a chance to move away from the carnage. Obama pledged the U.S. would accept 10,000 Syrians this budget year, which ends Sept. 30, and achieved that number a month early. This is in addition to about 75,000 refugees from other parts of the world.

General Assembly session.
Fifty-one corporations, including Facebook, Twitter, MasterCard, Johnson & Johnson, yogurt maker Chobani and other companies, have committed to easing access to education, employment and financial services for some 6.3 million refugees in more than 20 countries.
Criticized for not doing enough to help desperate people fleeing their countries because of war and or for other reasons, Obama was hosting a refugee summit Tuesday with the leaders of Jordan, Mexico, Sweden, Germany, Canada and Ethiopia, along with U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon.
Countries participating in the summit are expected to announce individual pledges that are in line with a U.S. goal of increasing humanitarian aid by $3 billion, doubling resettlement and providing access to jobs and education, said Samantha Power, U.S. ambassador to the U.N.
World leaders are grappling with the largest crisis of displaced persons since World War II, more than 65 million people who have fled their homes because of armed conflict or persecution, or because they are seeking asylum or a better way of life.
Power said the summit wouldn’t be a “panacea” for the crisis, but would show what the U.S. can achieve when it leads on an issue of global concern.
Last week, the White House announced that the U.S. would resettle 110,000 refugees in the coming year, a 30 percent increase over the 85,000 allowed in this year.
The 85,000 figure included 10,000 Syrian refugees, a figure advocacy groups had criticized as inadequate given the wealth of the U.S. and the fact that other countries, such as Canada and Germany, were welcoming far greater numbers of Syrians fleeing the civil war there.
The administration has yet to release a country-by-country breakdown of the 110,000 refugee figure.

Before the summit, Obama planned to meet with some of the CEOs of the corporations that have pledged support for refugees.
The refugee issue, meanwhile, was for the first time the subject of a daylong U.N. summit on Monday. Leaders approved a declaration to provide a more coordinated and humane response to the crisis, but the document included no concrete commitments and is not legally binding.

The new game plan addresses the 65 million people who have had to flee their homes in 2015.
“We are one team, and I’m asking you to do your utmost effort,” said U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon at a refugee forum held on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly. Ban, who was 6 years old when the Korean War broke out, had to leave his home in South Korea. Now, when he visits refugee camps around the world, he tells those living there: “I was one of you.”
With no end in sight to current conflicts in Syria, Afghanistan and South Sudan, the mountainous refugee crisis is going to get even worse, said Filippo Grandi, the top U.N. refugee official. The world’s mass migration is also caused by those seeking better economic opportunities.
“For decades, we treated refugee crises as a humanitarian crisis,” but those stop-gap measures are no longer sufficient, said Grandi, a day before the signing. The current crisis needs a longer-term fix, he said.
He and others view the U.N. declaration as a first step.
One refugee’s story
Yusra Mardini, 18, fled with her sister from Syria one year ago. They took a boat across the Aegean Sea, and when the engine died, she and several others pulled the vessel, containing 20 other refugees, to Greece’s shore.
Once the girls made it to Germany, Mardini took up swimming again and made the first-ever all-refugee team competing in last summer’s Olympic Games.

“I used to feel ashamed, because people called me ‘refugee,’” she said at a conference on Monday. But “this experience has given me a voice. … We are bodies without souls when we leave our dreams behind.”
Her parents are still in Syria, waiting to reunite with their daughters.
Where refugees go
The bulk of Syria’s refugees are in neighboring countries Turkey (2.7 million), Lebanon (1 million), Jordan (656,000), Iraq (239,000) and Egypt (115,000).
The refugees started the perilous journey across the Aegean Sea when they realized that Europe was their best hope to get jobs and send their children to school, said Melissa Fleming, spokeswoman for the U.N. refugee agency.
At first, they were accepted with open arms. “People actually applauded their arrival at train stations,” bringing them teddy bears and baked goods, she said.

But some European countries soon became concerned about the sheer numbers of refugees coming — there are more than 1 million Syrian asylum-seekers in Europe, according to the U.N. — and some nations started closing their borders.
One of the problems is Europe lacks a well-established resettlement program, said Jennifer Sime, senior vice president of U.S. programs at the International Rescue Committee.
In the U.S., meanwhile, President Barack Obama pledged to accept 10,000 Syrian refugees by the end of the fiscal year on Sept. 30. As of last week, the U.S. has taken in 11,958 Syrian refugees, Sime said.
“It may seem small, but the U.S. is still the country that resettles the most refugees,” about 85,000 total per year, she said. “Of course, more needs to be done.”
Supporting host countries
With most refugees in neighboring countries, the host countries need to feel like it’s not just the refugees getting the attention, said Helen Clark, administrator of the U.N. Development Program.
“We need to support the host countries, because there is a feeling that the international community is interested in refugees, ‘not us,’” she said.
There are practical things that other countries can do, Clark said. For example, Jordan, which hosts more than 600,000 refugees from Syria alone, has overloaded landfills. A $9 million grant from Canada enabled Jordan to reconfigure the landfills to cope with the increase in garbage, and now it is looking to introduce recycling and create more jobs, she said.
Such contributions help ease the burden a little, she said. “I’m not saying there aren’t tensions,” she said — just that the tensions could be worse.

Francis Saturday spoke to alumni of Jesuit schools in Europe who were in Rome for a conference on refugees.
The pope said: “I encourage you to welcome refugees into your homes and communities, so that their first experience of Europe is not the traumatic experience of sleeping cold on the streets, but one of warm welcome.”
Telling his audience that more than 65 million persons are forcibly displaced around the world, he advised going “beyond mere statistics.”
He said each refugee “has a name, a face and a story, as well as an inalienable right to live in peace and to aspire to a better future” for their children."

The United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child grilled representatives from Nauru for a total of nine hours on Tuesday and Wednesday during the group’s meeting in Geneva.
Nauru houses one of two offshore detention facilities — the other is on Manus island, also in the Pacific Ocean — where people seeking asylum in Australia are held. The refugees come from places such as Iran, Sri Lanka and Vietnam.
Nauru’s refugee detention facility has come under increased scrutiny from the international community following the leak of over 2,000 incident reports alleging assault, sexual abuse and poor living conditions.
Member of the Nauruan Parliament, Charmaine Scotty, who led the delegation, said in her opening statement, “We are doing the best we can given the limited resources available to us.”
The delegation touted its new law enforcing the protection of children as well as its partnership with UNICEF to a review its child protection system. Scotty said the island had also put in place a 24-hour hotline for victims to report abuse.
But over the two-day session, U.N. leaders pressed officials on child sexual abuse allegations, truancy rates among refugee children, and hostility toward journalists. During the questioning, Scotty became, at times, emotional defending her country and its people.
At one point, Scotty spurned allegations that refugee children had drowned in Nauru waters. Only one adult had drowned off the island, she said, because the refugee “did not understand that the tide was too strong.”
On the concern that journalists have been blocked from the camps, Samoa representative Clarence Nelson pointed out that the non-refundable visa fee for journalists has risen from $200 to $8,000.
Scotty responded that Nauru raised its visa fees for journalists because their negative reporting was making “hard work extra hard” to run the facility when the community was less accepting of refugees.
She also claimed visiting reporters behaved like “espionage secret agents,” lying on their forms about being tourists.
Amnesty International’s Anna Neistat, one of few journalists to witness the conditions on Nauru, told the PBS NewsHour last month the island detention facility is a product of “one of the most cynical refugee policies I’ve ever seen.”
Neistat said that refugees suffered “deliberate, systematic abuse” resulting in psychological trauma evidenced by the high rate of self-harm and attempted suicide.
Some people are putting part of the blame on Australia. The Australian government does not accept any refugees who travel by boat, so those who attempt the journey are detained at the offshore processing facility on Nauru, about 2,800 miles off the coast of Australia.
Australia’s immigration minster Thursday signaled a possible change to the controversial refugee policy by saying he would consider having Nauru refugees re-routed to New Zealand. But a New Zealand official said his government has no plans to enter into such an agreement.
Nauru’s delegation was the first to appear before the U.N. Committee on the Rights of the Child, which plans to question seven other countries over the next two weeks."

Caldwell, Associated Press",Where do the presidential candidates stand on refugees?,"WASHINGTON — The United States is the proud home of “the mother of exiles,” the Statue of Liberty. But of the millions of exiles from the Syrian war, only about 10,000 have reached U.S. shores.
Other countries are taking in more, though vast numbers of Syrians remains dispossessed. And even the limited number of Syrians coming to America is a source of hot contention in the presidential campaign as humanitarian impulses tangle with security worries in the debate.

WHERE THEY STAND
Republican Donald Trump has repeatedly called for a moratorium on accepting Syrian refugees. His position is part of a broader stance on immigrants that has ranged from a complete ban on foreign Muslim immigrants entering the United States “until we know what the hell is going on” to “extreme” vetting and an ideological test for would-be immigrants from countries and regions plagued by extremism.
Democrat Hillary Clinton has said she would expand President Barack Obama’s refugee program to accept about 65,000 Syrian refugees. This would be in addition to the tens of thousands of refugees accepted from around the world every year. Clinton said she would continue with the vetting currently in place, an effort that can take multiple years to complete.
___
WHY IT MATTERS
Hundreds of thousands of Syrians have sought refuge in Europe while many others wait in neighboring countries and refugee camps for the war to end or a chance to move away from the carnage. President Barack Obama pledged the U.S. would accept 10,000 Syrians this budget year, which ends Sept. 30, and achieved that number a month early. This is in addition to about 75,000 refugees from other parts of the world.
Meantime, Canada, with a little over one-tenth the population of the U.S., resettled 25,000 in four months and is processing about 19,000 more applications.
The influx of people from a region plagued by war and terrorism has some concerned about who may be coming to the United States. At issue for many people — prominent Republicans among them — has been the vetting of refugees, especially after multiple, deadly attacks in France and Belgium. They worry Islamic State militants or sympathizers will infiltrate the refugee ranks.
The Obama administration has said the vetting is thorough and involves multiple in-person interviews and checks by the intelligence community and federal law enforcement. Would-be refugees are asked for biographical details about themselves, including their relatives, friendships, social or political activities, employment and education, phone numbers, email accounts and more. They must also provide biometric information, like fingerprints. But no system is foolproof.
Two Iraqi refugees were arrested in Kentucky in 2011 on charges that they were trying to send money and weapons to groups fighting the United States in Iraq. But no Syrian refugees have been accused of plotting or carrying out attacks inside the United States.
The future of refugee processing for Syrians almost certainly hinges on the outcome of the election.
ISSUE MATTERS: Where do the presidential candidates stand on Iran?"

The increase reflects continuing concern about the refugee crisis stemming from Syria’s civil war and conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. Yet it’s still far short of what advocacy groups say is needed to address an unprecedented crisis that saw some 1 million people pour into Europe alone last year.
Of the 110,000, 40,000 will come from the Middle East and South Asia, where the origins of the crisis have been most pronounced. An additional 35,000 will come from Africa, 12,000 from East Asia, 4,000 from Europe and 5,000 from Latin America and the Caribbean, White House spokesman Josh Earnest said.
The administration did not release a country-specific breakdown. The total includes 14,000 unallocated slots that can be given to refugees from any region once Congress is notified.
Secretary of State John Kerry had previously suggested that the U.S. target would climb to 100,000 in the coming year, but that the figure was a floor, not a ceiling. He briefed lawmakers on the revised figure on Tuesday.
The 110,000 goal covers a 12-month period that starts next month. In the 12 months ending Sept. 30, the U.S. goal was 85,000, and in the three years before that, the target was 70,000 per year.
The White House has tried to emphasize that the refugee program is safe and doesn’t pose a major threat to national security. That concern was heightened last year after terrorist attacks in European cities, including some connected to people who had spent time in Syria.
Officials said that potential refugees would continue to be subject a rigorous screening process that typically lasts more than a year and involves both in-person interviews and examination of biographical and biometric information.
The 110,000 goal covers a 12-month period that starts next month.
The announcement came two weeks after the U.S. announced it had met President Barack Obama’s goal of admitting 10,000 Syrian refugees despite early skepticism that it would reach its goal. Millions of Syrians have been displaced by a civil war that has killed roughly half a million people.
Republican governors have pushed back vehemently and tried to refuse to let them into their states, leading to a clash with the administration, which has maintained that states can’t legally bar refugees who otherwise meet the criteria.
The U.S. has tried to encourage other countries, too, to increase their contribution to alleviating the refugee crisis. The official said increasing the U.S. target this year reflected that strategy and Obama’s belief that all nations need to do more to help the neediest.
As part of that effort, Obama plans to host a summit on refugee issues with world leaders next week during the U.N. General Assembly gathering in New York. The White House said the summit would spotlight the need to increase money for aid agencies, resettle more refugees and provide education and job assistance.
The refugee crisis has become a major political issue in Europe, where countries have been inundated by migrants after harrowing journeys that have killed scores. Concerns about refugees have played into the broader debate about immigration in Europe and were a major factor in Britain’s recent vote to leave the European Union.
The U.N. refugee agency chief, Filippo Grandi, said Tuesday that while the U.S. is “by far the largest donor government to refugee programs worldwide,” more still needs to be done. In an Associated Press interview, he said the U.N. was discussing those needs with the U.S. “all the time.”

https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/column-uplifting-story-sardinia-unraveled,refugee,1435,2016-09-13T15:37:49-04:00,Malcolm Brabant,Column: How an uplifting story about refugees in Sardinia quickly unraveled,"Eighteen months into Europe’s migrant crisis, it’s become something of a challenge to find stories that shed a new or unusual light on this historic movement of people.
My interest was piqued a couple of months back by an item on ANSA, the respected Italian News Agency, about some derelict land on the Italian island of Sardinia that had been handed over to a group of 50 African farmers so they could become independent of government assistance, and learn new techniques that they could take back home, should conditions ever permit.
My Rome-based colleague Alessandra Maggiorani phoned the main spokesman for the African cooperative, a Senegalese man called Cheikh Diankha, and everything seemed to stand up; filming the project sounded very straightforward.
We were just waiting for an opportunity to put it in the can.
And that turned out to be on a trip to Italy earlier this month, where our main aim was to shoot a feature about how 80 percent of Nigerian women who make it across the Mediterranean are forced into prostitution. The Sardinia farm story would be the second of our assignment.
We were on a train heading for Milan Central Station when Alessandra called Diankha to confirm we were on our way. She told him we wanted to shoot some scenes at dawn on Friday, Sept. 2. He said Friday morning would be impossible because the farmers were doing something else but assured us that filming toward dusk on Friday and over the weekend would be achievable.
So we boarded a flight to the Northern Sardinian town of Alghero, confident that we would soon have a fairly simple and possibly uplifting story in the bag.
We couldn’t have been more wrong.
The assignment turned out to be one of the most opaque of my professional life.
More than 10 days after we landed in Sardinia, I’m still not sure what the true story is.
What I am certain of though, is that somehow we kicked a hornet’s nest and in the process got an interesting look at the underbelly of a country that’s struggling to cope with the impact of mass migration as well as some of the people who’re making money out of it.
If Cheikh Diankha had just fobbed us off and had told us he couldn’t help, we’d have perhaps shrugged our shoulders and not traveled to Sardinia.
But he stopped taking our calls when we got there, as did a man called Luca Pintus, who was named as the owner of the land given to the African farmers.
So we started digging into the project and its main partners.
On the days we visited the land in Platamona, in Northern Sardinia, there was nobody working. Workers in neighboring vineyards had seen and heard nothing. And they had a clear view of the land. One of them was a policeman who passed the entrance every single day.
The consistent theme of these conversations was that Sardinian agriculture was struggling and many farmers were wary of migrants taking over their jobs by undercutting wages. So any Africans in the fields would have raised eyebrows, if not more.
Cheikh Diankha ran a refugee center, and seemed to be the go-to man on Sardinia in terms of migrant issues. He was linked to a number of integration initiatives including teaching newcomers the Italian language.
Luca Pintus’ reputation on the island was not particularly savory. We consulted senior police officers, neighbors, old family employees, council officials and other institutions. The least-worst character assessment was offered by a farmer. He described Pintus as the black sheep of a wealthy family who was always trying to make a fast buck.
We tracked down Pintus to his mother’s cafe in the main square of Sassari, a Northern Sardinian town. He put aside his plate of lasagna and assured us that the project was aboveboard; we could see all the paperwork, and he would arrange a facility with a talented migrant fashion designer who had allegedly attracted the attention of Giorgio Armani. When his mother was out of earshot, he gave us another phone number that we could use to contact him. He didn’t want his mother to hear the number and check up on him.

On Monday, Sept. 5, we went to an address in a trendy building not far from the cafe, to a meeting that Pintus had set up. He was supposed to be there, along with the migrant designer, and a fellow director of Cheikh Diankha’s company. When we got there, the only person present was Diankha’s colleague, Giovanni Rossi, who described himself as an accountant. To cut a long story short, he didn’t want to do a televised interview. We did. And he took a swing at my camera, while failing to answer questions about whether the African farmers existed.
During our earlier conversation, Pintus had named the local farmers union, the Coldiretti, and a psychologist as having supported the farmers project.
We talked to a senior Coldiretti official who said they were approached informally, and liked the idea as it would provide food for local schools and markets. But they were not presented with any documents and they did not become involved.

Pintus sent us some photos showing him and Diankha at a Coldiretti event. The farmers’ association moved very quickly to distance itself from the project once we started asking questions.
As for the psychologist, she was named as a supporting professional in a scheme for Alzheimer’s patients that was closed down because of deception and physical abuse.
So was this farmer’s scheme a case of fraud?
We don’t know, because we never managed to discover which authority had approved it. Despite Pintus’ promises, the paperwork was never forthcoming.
We went to see Cheikh Diankha at his office in a former disco once known as the “Kiss Kiss,” which in its earlier days was closed down in a prostitution racket.
The Kiss Kiss is now a reception center, holding about 100 mainly African migrants.
To say that Diankha was surprised to see us would be an understatement. And he started shaking like a leaf when I asked if the farmers’ project was a scam.
His answers and those of Luca Pintus were inconsistent. Diankha claimed the cooperative had not started work. Yet, there had been a report on local television. Also, he insisted, they had yet to receive a penny. Pintus claimed the last time his land had farmers on it was 15 days previously.
Diankha ushered us out of the Kiss Kiss, saying I shouldn’t even think about filming.
The company Janas International has a “reception center” to house refugees. Image by Malcolm Brabant
Like other businesses running reception centers, his company, Janas International, which specializes in “facilities and hospitality,” receives about 32 euros or $36 a day per migrant. The money is supposed to pay for food and clothing. The potential daily income for his company at the Kiss Kiss is $3,600 a day. In a year, that’s about $1.3 million.
Pintus, ever talkative, told us that Diankha and Giovanni Rossi were planning to open up another reception center.
So what were they all trying to hide, if anything?
I’m truly puzzled. But surely it had nothing to do with concerns from local residents that the center was being used as a base for prostitution?
It’s entirely possible that some of the migrants living in the center are among the 80 percent of Nigerian women who make it to Italy and are forced into the sex trade to pay for their crossing.
That doesn’t mean that Diankha and his hospitality company are involved. But he and his partner are certainly profiting from the migrant crisis. There are literally hundreds of millions of dollars in public funds being thrown at the migrant crisis and the opportunities for fraud are enormous.
In June, we reported from Sicily that the Italian Finance Police had cracked a massive fraud by the Mafia in which migrant reception centers were used as a vehicle to defraud the state of billions.
The European Union is so concerned about its coffers being emptied by criminals, that it’s set up a special task force in conjunction with the Italian state. We know from our inquiries that several institutions in Sardinia are now examining the activities of the gentlemen we encountered.
But this being Italy, I can’t tell you anything official.

Obama sought a sixfold increase in the number of Syrian refugees provided safe haven in the United States. After a slow start, the administration was able to hit the goal about a month early and just a few weeks before Obama convenes a summit on refugees during the 71st session of the United Nations General Assembly.
Obama would have been hard-pressed to make the case for other countries to do more with the U.S. failing to reach a goal that amounts to only about 2 percent of the 480,000 Syrian refugees in need of resettlement. Millions more Syrians have fled to neighboring states such as Jordan, Turkey, Lebanon and to countries in Europe since the civil war broke out in 2011.
“On behalf of the president and his administration, I extend the warmest of welcomes to each and every one of our Syrian arrivals, as well as the many other refugees resettled this year from all over the world,” National Security Adviser Susan Rice said in a statement.
Rice said the summit in New York City will highlight the contributions the U.S. and other nations have made to help refugees. She said the U.S. has committed to working with the international community to increase funding for humanitarian assistance and double the number of refugees afforded the opportunity to resettle.
“Together, we can build a more sustainable and responsive humanitarian system capable of meeting today’s unprecedented global humanitarian challenges,” Rice said.
The increase in Syrian refugees also comes at a time of heightened national security concerns following extremist attacks in the U.S. and abroad. The Obama administration has said that refugees fleeing war and persecution are the most scrutinized of all immigrants who come into the United States. The process typically takes 12 months to 18 months and includes in-person interviews and a review of biographical and biometric information.
Officers with the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services travel to the country where the refugees fled of interview them. Upon completion of security and medical screening, the Homeland Security officer may approve the refugee’s application for U.S. resettlement. After approval, arrangements are made to match the refugee with a voluntary agency in the U.S. that specializes in helping them find a new home and employment."
https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/former-refugees-look-election-day-sense-duty,refugee,645,2016-08-14T09:15:07-04:00,"Ezra Kaplan, Associated Press",Former refugees look to Election Day with a sense of duty,"NEW YORK — The path to the voting booth hasn’t been easy for Hatoumata Tounkara, but the former West African refugee says she couldn’t have picked a better election to cast her first ballot.
As a newly naturalized American citizen, she’s one of thousands of former refugees and asylum-seekers who will be voting in a U.S. election for the first time this November.
“This election is very special to me,” Tounkara said. “This can show my daughter that she can become anything she wants in her life, because back home, women just cook and take care of the men.”
At 23, Tounkara fled her home in Mali after rejecting an arranged marriage. She made her way to the United States via Gambia in 2008. It took two years for the U.S. to grant her asylum, and then she waited six more for a chance to take the citizenship test.
The road to citizenship is full of challenges for those fleeing oppression and war back home. Many have witnessed the consequences of autocratic rule and civil strife. They’ve spent years navigating the bureaucracy to get to the U.S. and, eventually, to become a citizen. There are those who believe they hold a personal stake in this election, with immigration becoming a central issue.
As a Muslim, Tounkara says she is put off by some of Donald Trump’s rhetoric and will vote for Hillary Clinton. But voting against Trump isn’t what is motivating her to vote, said Tounkara, now 31.
“If you don’t vote, nobody will hear your voice,” she said.
The U.S. government doesn’t keep statistics on how many of the over 700,000 immigrants naturalized each year are former refugees or how many of those new citizens register to vote.
Over the past decade, about 150,000 refugees or asylum-seekers on average were granted lawful permanent resident status per year. About 60 percent of all green cardholders eventually become citizens, according to the Pew Research Center.
While most eligible refugees are excited and eager to participate in democracy, there are many hurdles to active involvement, said Ramla Sahid, executive director of the Partnership for the Advancement of New Americans, a San Diego nonprofit group that promotes civic engagement.
Endless paperwork, fees reaching almost $2,000, in-person interviews, fingerprinting, a written 100-question civics test, an English test, and lots of waiting. And still, there are no guarantees. Green cardholders must live in the U.S. for five years before they can become a citizen.
Bandana Rai, 57, who fled Nepal during a 10-year civil war that ended in 2006, said her appreciation of the vote is enhanced by what she went through to become a citizen.
“You have to really want it,” Rai said.
Arbey Hamadi, who was born in a camp for Somalian refugees in Kenya, became a U.S. citizen automatically as a teenager when her parents were naturalized in 2012. She is excited to participate in her first election this fall at age 20 — partly because her opposition to Trump, who has proposed a temporary ban on foreign Muslims from entering the U.S.
“As a Muslim, I think we have to stand shoulder to shoulder so that we can amplify our voices and stand against hate,” she said.
In areas where there are large concentrations of refugees, they are learning that they can serve as a legitimate political force.
In Minneapolis this past week, Ilhan Omar, a former refugee from Somalia, defeated another Somali refugee, Mohamud Noor, as well as 44-year-incumbent for the Democratic nomination for a seat in the state Legislature.
She is now poised to become the nation’s first Somali-American state lawmaker.
Noor, who was naturalized in 2005, said in Somalia there were no elections.
“When you come to a place that you really want to be in, you cherish those democratic ideals that you get to participate in by being a citizen,” he said."
https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/shrinking-small-towns-see-hope-refugees,refugee,1479,2016-08-05T16:52:46-04:00,"Tim Henderson, Stateline","Amid anti-immigration wave, some small towns welcome refugees with open arms","RUTLAND, Vermont — Mayor Christopher Louras sees trouble ahead for this small city of about 16,000 at the foot of the Green Mountains.
“It’s a strong, vibrant community but unless we do something to stem the population decline, we’re going to be in big, big trouble,” Louras said. “And it’s not just Rutland. Rutland is a microcosm of the state and small towns around the country.”
But the mayor sees a quick fix. He’s asked Vermont’s resettlement agency to send refugees to Rutland, and says they would help fill vacant housing and entry-level jobs to keep the economy moving.
It’s an approach small towns from Montana to Georgia are increasingly considering as they grapple with shrinking and aging populations.
The mayors of Central Falls, Rhode Island; Clarkston, Georgia; and Haledon, New Jersey, joined big-city mayors last year in signing a letter saying they had accepted Syrian refugees and would take more. And as some governors and members of Congress called for a halt to the arrival of refugees from Syria, the mayors of Normal, Urbana and Evanston in Illinois; Socorro, Texas; and Clearfield City, Utah, signed a letter that noted “the importance of continuing to welcome refugees to our country and to our cities.”
Few refugees have resettled in Montana since 1991. But with Missoula Mayor John Engen’s support, a branch of the International Rescue Committee opened its doors and the group has arranged to help settle 100 Congolese refugees, who are expected to start arriving this month.
The decision to seek refugees, especially Muslims from Syria, can be a political lightning rod. The mayor of Sandpoint, Idaho — population 7,800 — proposed welcoming Syrian refugees when he was sworn in, in January, but withdrew the idea the same month after raucous protests.
But there’s a growing sense among local officials, especially in small towns, that refugees have something to offer the economy, said Eskinder Negash, a former director of the federal Office of Refugee Resettlement.
“Every time a refugee rents an apartment, every time a refugee shops for food, there’s some income coming in for the city and going into the tax base,” said Negash, now a senior vice president of the U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants (USCRI), a network of groups that help resettle refugees around the country. “There’s a new realization that refugees can be an economic engine for some of these small communities.”
REVERSING THE LOSSES
Small towns and rural areas across the U.S. have been losing population since 2010, though the losses have shrunk to 4,000 a year in 2015 from an average of 33,000 a year earlier in the decade, according to a May report from the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
But in many areas, refugees have helped to offset or reverse the losses.
About 350 refugees settled in Fargo, North Dakota, last year, mostly from Somalia, Iraq and Bhutan. And they have contributed to strong population and economic growth, said Fargo’s mayor, Dr. Tim Mahoney.
“Our refugees have come in and brought a lot to our community,” Mahoney said. “They opened a mosque, and people came in and said, ‘Oh, this is just like a Lutheran social. There’s food.’ ”
The refugees also made the city more diverse, Mahoney said, with the non-white population growing from 2 to 11 percent since 2002.
“Our priority is to be a welcoming city and continue to grow in that manner,” Mahoney said.
In Clarkston, Mayor Ted Terry, a Democrat, said you can read the history of world conflict in the city’s refugee population. There are Vietnamese, many now elderly, who came in the wake of the Vietnam War; Ethiopians, Eritreans, Somalis, Sudanese, Bosnians, Bhutanese and Burmese, who started arriving in the ’90s; more recent arrivals from Afghanistan and Iraq; and Syrians, who began to arrive last year. Many of the refugees have found jobs in chicken plants, where Mexican immigrants used to work.
Terry, who said he has personally provided one Syrian family with furniture and clothes, said there’s always some controversy about refugees. “One school of thought [among residents] is that we don’t have room for them,” Terry said. “To that I tell people, ‘What if they weren’t here? All these apartments would be vacant, and vacant apartments lead to crime. They are very peaceful, hardworking people.’ ”
About 70,000 refugees were resettled in the United States last year. Iraq and Burma were the largest sources of refugees, with a combined 31,000 people. About 1,700 were from Syria; the Obama administration announced last year it wants to ramp the number up to 10,000 this year.
CONTROVERSY IN RUTLAND
Across Vermont, a shrinking and aging population, low unemployment, and a struggle to find workers are hindering economic progress, according to a report this year by the Vermont Chamber Foundation’s Vermont Futures initiative. “Vermont will need to find a way to attract and retain qualified workers,” another report found.
Rutland has lost more than 100 people every year this decade, according to census estimates.
The median age in Rutland County is 46.2, up from 44.3 in 2010 and more than eight years above the national median age of 37.8 last year.
Unemployment was 3.6 percent in the area as of May, which Louras said was too low. (The national rate was 4.7 percent and Vermont’s was 3.1 percent.) And local businesses say they have a hard time recruiting entry-level workers.
“We don’t have enough employees,” said Tyler Richardson, an assistant director of the Rutland Economic Development Corporation. “There’s a desperation as to what’s the next step, how to attract people to this region, how we fill these positions.”
Louras says refugee families would help fill vacant housing and entry-level jobs, and provide more diversity that could help attract young families to an aging, overwhelmingly white community.
After considering other cities in the state, the Vermont Refugee Resettlement Program, the local affiliate of the USCRI, recommended that 100 Syrian refugees be sent to Rutland. The group is awaiting approval from the U.S. State Department and the refugees could begin to arrive in November, said Stacie Blake, director of government and community relations for USCRI.
A volunteer organization, Rutland Welcomes, has sprung up, with more than 700 volunteers who have broken into committees to learn Arabic and plan for welcoming and cultural exchange events, said Marsha Cassel, a high school French teacher who is part of the volunteer group’s informal leadership.
But not everyone in town agrees that refugees are the answer.
Seven of the 11 members on the Rutland Board of Aldermen signed a letter asking the State Department not to send refugees. One of them, Edward Larson, said he wants more background checks and thinks the mayor should have asked the board before proceeding on his own.
“I believe the mayor was wrong in his actions albeit his intentions were good,” Larson said.
Valerie Fusco, 76, has lived in the area since she was 9 years old and raised three children who did well in Rutland as a barber, a salesman and a nurse. But that was the last generation that stayed here, she said.
“The young couples, if they’re lucky, go to college and move on because there’s nothing here for them. Where are the jobs we’re going to give these new people? I have nothing against them but we should take care of our own first,” Fusco said.
But several employers said they would welcome the new arrivals.
The area’s largest employer is Rutland Regional Medical Center, with about 1,600 employees. Its president, Tom Huebner, said that of the hospital’s 140 job openings, some could be filled by refugees, especially in housekeeping and food service. Ursula Hirschmann, a German immigrant who owns a fast-growing custom windows business in Rutland, said she would hire refugees in entry-level jobs like sanding and assembly.
NEW LIFE AND ENERGY
Small towns don’t always have to actively seek refugees. Around 2000, Lewiston, Maine, found itself a preferred destination for Somali Bantu refugees who were initially relocated in more urban areas around the country.
“They were searching for something that felt a little smaller and more intimate, a little more manageable,” said Catherine Besteman, an anthropology professor at Colby College who has written about the Lewiston refugees.
Alarmed by the pace of arrivals, then-mayor Laurier Raymond Jr. wrote a letter in 2002 asking Somalis to stop coming, sparking demonstrations and counter-demonstrations. But a subsequent mayor, Larry Gilbert, said at a U.S. Senate hearing in 2011 that the Somalis had brought “new life and energy” to Lewiston. Besteman agreed.
“Lisbon Street [in Lewiston] had a lot of empty storefronts, and now it’s full of Somali cafes, translation agencies, a mosque,” Besteman said. “People think of large urban areas when they think of immigration and refugees, but I think small towns may be where we should be looking.”

Caldwell, Associated Press","U.S. poised to hit Obama’s goal of admitting 10,000 Syrian refugees","WASHINGTON — After a slow start, it appears increasingly likely that the Obama administration will hit its goal of admitting 10,000 Syrian refugees into the United States before the end of September.
State Department totals show that 2,340 Syrian refugees arrived last month in the United States.
That’s more than what occurred during the entire seven months after President Barack Obama directed his team to prepare for 10,000 admissions from the war-torn country. Total admissions for the current budget year now come to about 7,900, and the vast majority of them are Sunni Muslims, records show.
If the pace from June and July continues this month, the target should be reached with a couple weeks to spare before Obama heads to the United Nations to urge world leaders to admit more refugees and to increase funding for relief organizations. The U.N. General Assembly is holding a summit to address the large movements of refugees and migrants that stems primarily from conflicts in the Middle East and Africa.
Obama would have been hard-pressed to make the case for other countries to do more with the U.S. failing to reach a goal that amounts to only about 2 percent of the 480,000 Syrian refugees in need of resettlement.
Organizations that help relocate Syrian refugees said the White House and other administration officials have grown increasingly confident of hitting the target.
“They put more resources on it, which is allowing more individual’s to be processed and therefore able to travel,” said Stacie Blake, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants, one of nine groups that help resettle Syrian refugees.
Obama’s call for 10,000 entries this year was criticized by most Republican governors and the GOP presidential candidates, who argued that the government lacked an adequate screening system to prevent suspected terrorists from slipping into the U.S.
Extremist attacks in Europe and the U.S. have increased concerns about immigration. An Associated Press-GfK poll conducted in early July showed that 69 percent of Republicans say they favor the temporary ban on Muslim immigration. Overall, Americans opposed such a ban by a margin of 52 percent to 45 percent.
Rep. Vern Buchanan, R-Fla., sent a letter to Obama on Thursday calling on him to stop accepting Syrian refugees as a matter of national security.
“We are seeing a clear pattern in which a number of recent attacks have been carried out by ISIS terrorists with ties to Syria,” Buchanan said, using one of the acronyms for the Islamic State group. He cited the killing of a French priest, the murder of a German woman with a machete and a bombing at a German music festival as examples.
The White House has emphasized that the screening process for refugees takes 12 months to 18 months and includes in-person interviews and a review of biographical and biometric information. The administration also has said it is focused on bringing in refugees who are in the most desperate situations, such as families with children and those in need of medical care. In the year prior to Obama’s new target, the U.S. accepted about 1,680 Syrian refugees.
Secretary of State John Kerry, speaking with reporters during a visit to Buenos Aires, Argentina, said the United States has developed “sufficient methods” of screening would-be refugees.
“We are very comfortable that we are bringing people in who will be a great plus to our country.” Kerry said.
Kerry said that “not one event in the United States, of terror” has been committed by a refugee allowed to resettle in the U.S.
But two Iraqi refugees were arrested in 2011 for plotting to send weapons and money to al-Qaida operatives fighting against U.S. troops back in Iraq. The scheme was foiled, but the case did leave jitters about whether extremists could slip in among the Syrian refugees.
“We believe … the people who are fleeing Syria are the most harmed by terrorism. They are parents. They are children. They are orphans,” Kerry said. “It is very important that we do not close our hearts to the victims of such violence.”
Kerry also applauded Argentina’s pledge to resettled 3,000 Syrian refugees in the South American country and said the United States is committed to working with the government there on security issues.

In Montana, health care officials report that abuse there is worse than the national average. But the casualties of the opioid epidemic are not all drug abusers.
On a recent night, three Montana residents, who call themselves pain refugees, boarded an airplane from Missoula to Los Angeles. They say that finding doctors willing to treat chronic pain in Montana is almost impossible, and the only way they can get relief is to fly out of state.
Before Gary Snook dropped into his seat, he paused in the aisle, pressing his fingertips into his upper thigh. He bent his knees slightly and moved his hips side to side. He was getting in one final stretch before takeoff.
“My pain, it’s all from my waist down,” he said. “It’s like being boiled in oil 24 hours a day.” Snook has been taking opioids since he had spine surgery for a ruptured disk 14 years ago. After the operation, he says he was in so much pain he couldn’t work. He’s tried all kinds of things to get better.
“I got a surgery, epidural steroid injections, acupuncture, anti-inflammatories, physical therapy, pool exercises,” he said. “I’ve tried anything that anyone has ever suggested me to try. Unfortunately what I do right now is the only thing that works.”
Snook says though he might seem desperate like someone who is addicted to pain killers, he’s not. He’s not craving a quick fix. He leaves his home for treatment because he has no confidence in the doctors in Montana and he wants to be healed.
“I believe pain control is a fundamental human right, or at least an attempt at pain control,” he said. “To deny someone with a horrible disease like me access to pain medications is the worst form of cruelty.”
It was dark outside when Snook, his wife and the two other pain patients got off the plane in Los Angeles. They wheeled their suitcases to a rented SUV. When they got to the hotel, they smiled and greeted the lobby clerk by name.
The trip has become routine. Every 90 days, they come here to see a doctor who gives them the care and prescriptions they say they can’t get at home.
Fear Among Montana Doctors
Montana is a tough state to find many options for any medical care. Because much of the state is rural, residents often travel long distances, including out of state, for specialty care.
In the past several years, the Montana Board of Medical Examiners has taken on several high-profile cases of doctors it suspects of overprescribing opioids. At least two Montana doctors have had their licenses suspended since 2014.
Executive Officer Ian Marquand said his organization doesn’t play favorites. “The board does not encourage particular kinds of doctors, it does not discourage particular kinds of doctors. The door is open in Montana for any qualified, competent physician to come in and practice.”
But Marc Mentel acknowledged that there’s fear around prescription painkillers in Montana’s medical community. He chairs the Montana Medical Association’s committee on prescription drug abuse, and he said he does hear of doctors being more wary.
Mentel, who started practicing medicine in the 1990s, said that when he was training, medical education didn’t include treating long-term pain.
“The perfect tool, the perfect medicine that would take away a person’s pain and allow them to function normally does not yet exist,” he said. “So we are trying to use any tool, any means we can to help lessen the severity of their pain.”
Mentel said opioids do help some patients, but he hopes his generation of doctors will learn more about pain and understand ways to treat it beyond opioids.
In March, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published long-awaited guidelines that said opioids should be the treatment of last resort for pain, and if used, should be combined with other treatments such as exercise therapy.
“Patients are in pain,” Mentel said. “We don’t have great tools for them and we need to recognize that this is going to be a chronic-disease state. They may be in pain for the rest of their lives. So … how do we treat them without actually harming them?” he said.
The California Solution
For Snook, relief is found at a small strip-mall clinic in suburban Los Angeles run by Dr. Forest Tennant, a former Army physician who says he has consulted for the National Institute on Drug Abuse, the National Football League and NASCAR.
He has about 150 patients, half of them from out of state.
Tennant says there are legitimate reasons to be concerned about opioids, and that’s why doctors need to specialize in pain management.
To an untrained physician, Tennant said, addicts and pain patients can look similar. “Doctors can get conned,” he said. “I think that it is true that we’ve had a lot of opioids that get out on the street, and people get them … whether it is heroin or a prescription opioid.”
But opioids can also help people, Tennant said. Because of that, he said, the drugs shouldn’t be stigmatized, but used responsibly.
“They are the last resort, when there is no other option. You don’t use them until everything else has failed,” he said.
Tennant is lobbying for a Montana bill to guarantee more access to opioids for pain patients, so people like Snook don’t need to travel so far for a prescription.
“Had I stayed in Montana, I would have killed myself,” said Snook. “I just want humanitarian care, and I get that in California.”

“There is something missing there,” she used to think, looking at pictures of the child she became in the 1980s during Lebanon’s civil war.
The sound of “constant bombings” outside her house left her with intense social anxiety and a fear of bright lights and loud noises for years: a car’s headlights shining in her driveway was enough to make her cry out in the night.
Ghanem graduated from school and began working as an actor, but said she did not feel like she could cope with her trauma until three years ago, when she discovered an unexpected passion for clowning. “I gave the child in me the freedom she was always looking for,” she said.
Now, she is a member of Clown Me In, a Beirut-based clowning group that performs for young Syrian refugees: the children of a new generation of war.
A clown troupe’s origin story
In the five years since the Syrian revolution became a multi-faction war, 2.4 million children have become refugees, according to the United Nations. Another 306,000 children have been born as refugees in the past four years. Many of these children now live in Lebanon, where more than a quarter of the country’s current population recently migrated from Syria.
Now, their story is intersecting with a centuries-old tradition of clowning. Clowns appear in historical records as far back as ancient Egypt and ancientimperial China, developed further in the tradition of commedia dell’arte in Italy, showed up in medieval Europe as jesters and drew attention in the 18th century in Britain as pantomime became popular.
But the “the first recognizable ancestor of the modern clown,” according to the Smithsonian, came with Grimaldi, an English clown born in 1778 who brought together a combination of physical comedy, absurd costumes and white makeup for audiences of thousands.
Clowns have long drawn on a sense of grotesqueness for their performances; as far back as 1876, French literary critic Edmond de Goncourt wrote that clown performances were “terrifying and full of anxiety and apprehension.” But the cliche of the “scary clown” as it appears in the popular imagination — their face pancaked with white makeup and wearing a cartoonish grimace — arose relatively recently in the history of clown, and cemented with the crimes of John Wayne Gacy, a clown performer who killed 35 young men in the 1970s.
But Clown Me In eschews the heavy makeup that many Americans associate with clowns and performs with an emphasis on movement, mime and audience participation. Sabine Choucair, the founder of the group, began clowning in 2006 shortly after she graduated from the London International School of Performing Arts.
“I was like, ‘Wow, this is a magical thing that I would want to do for the rest of my life. I don’t want to do anything else,’” she said.
She started trying to hold clowning performances and workshops in Lebanon, but at first it “totally failed, because people just thought that I was weird,” she said.
But in 2008, Choucair and her friend Gabriela Muñoz formed Clown Me In, a clowning group that began more and more to focus on social issues in Lebanon. One of their projects in 2014 raised awareness about traffic safety by clowning around cars at busy intersections, she said.
“Nobody stopped on traffic lights in Lebanon,” she said. “We would go to the red lights, we would stop and start clowning around with people who actually stop, congratulating them for stopping, offering them some magic tricks.”
Choucair calls these guerrilla performances “clown attacks.” And at that point, she knew where she wanted to bring them next: refugee camps.
In 2016, Choucair traveled to Germany to perform with Clowns Without Borders, a nonprofit clowning group, at Berlin Tempelhof Airport, an airport built in 1927 that stopped operating in 2008. Tempelhof’s massive hangars now host thousands of Syrian refugees who have fled war in their home country.
But as they wait, a common feeling of hopelessness pervades the camp, Choucair said. When she arrived there in the spring of 2015, some of the refugees told her that there had been five suicide attempts the previous week. “There’s this common feeling of boredom and no hope,” Choucair said.
But then, they began the performance. One of the clowns began playing the accordion, leading the other performers down a long hallway. Choucair followed, blowing bubbles to every corner of the space. And as they danced through the airport, more and more people joined in — fathers holding their babies in the air, children who reached to pop the bubbles, a boy who told them it was his birthday.
“He thought this was a very special day because at least there was something different. There was music, there was joy, there was laughter in the space,” Choucair said.

The rest of Clown Me In joined her when she came back to Lebanon for a tour of performances, many of them at schools and refugee camps in the Bekaa Valley, where more than 360,000 Syrian refugees are living.
Not all of the children who attend those performances are Syrian — a number of Palestinians, for example, have settled in the Shatila refugee camp, where the group has held shows. Clown Me In doesn’t focus on the kids’ home country, only that they want to laugh, Choucair said.
‘We all laugh together’
There is no typical performance in the Bekaa Valley, only the assurance that it will begin with two cars full of clowns.
Arriving at one performance, clown Sara Berjawi said that the kids were “completely shocked to see a car full of clowns. They surrounded our cars and they were laughing.”
For another performance, Clown Me In arrived at the Malala Yousafzai All-Girls School in the Bekaa Valley, a school that serves Syrian refugees, only to find out that they were older than the group expected — most were 15 to 19 years old. “We were like, ‘Whoa! I wonder how this is gonna be,’” Choucair said, laughing.
That show ended up being one of their best, she said. “The girls cracked up. We literally made their day,” she said. “We enjoyed it so much because they were enjoying it.”

But Ghanem said that during the performance, she couldn’t help but think of how truncated their childhoods may have been.
“We were really in love with those girls because they really needed to stay children. Girls at this age can be married — society expects them to be adults at this age,” Ghanem said. “When we played to those girls, I really felt that my heart was in pain. I was like, ‘Oh my god, I have this 16-year-old girl that looks at me, and I can see, in her eyes, a 33-year-old.”
As the Syrian war continues, conditions have become increasingly difficult for child refugees, millions of whom have been deprived of attending school. 2.1 million children in Syria, and 700,000 Syrian refugee children, are not in school.
This issue plays out in the audiences for Clown Me In shows, some of whom were very difficult to manage on this year’s tour, according to Choucair. In the absence of school, she said many of the children found it difficult to sit still and focus — particularly at one performance.
“I’ve been performing in the camps for the past 5 years and I think this time was the hardest,” she said. “It was very chaotic. … they haven’t been in a classroom for four years, most of them.”
But usually, once Clown Me In begins inviting kids onstage, they all want to be a part of it, Choucair said.

That’s a method of performance that can help build community and taps into a long tradition of theatrical clowning, according to Christopher Scheer, who has taught clowning and worked as a clown for nearly a decade.
Theatrical clowning often lacks any semblance of the invisible “fourth wall” that usually divides the audience and performer, leaving the relationship between them open to possibility: clowns may ask the audience to participate in a call and response, or bring one or several people into the show.
Pulling one person on stage is a risky move, but also one that can form a bond within the audience, Scheer said. “The audience will inherently identify with them, because they came from the audience, because they don’t know what will happen next,” he said. “They discover that they are having the same reactions to all these things. So they start to feel like a tribe or like a community.”
Choucair said she can feel this sense of community in audiences no matter where she’s performing. “This is what’s important about clowning: it doesn’t matter where you are, what you’re going through. We all laugh together,” Choucair said.

Johnson tells the Senate Judiciary Committee that approximately 5,000 refugees have been approved for settlement, and an additional 5,000 to 6,000 have been conditionally approved, pending security checks.
The Obama administration decided last year to sharply increase the number of Syrian refugees taken into the United States. That decision was hotly opposed by congressional Republicans who warned that it could let terrorists into the country.
The House passed legislation in the wake of the Paris attacks last fall to increase screening of Syrian refugees, but the Senate didn’t follow suit.

The agency estimates 65.3 million individuals were forced from their homes last year — nearly 6 million more people than in 2014. The UN numbers include, but is not limited to refugees.
“We are facing the biggest refugee and displacement crisis of our time,” United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said in a statement. “Above all, this is not just a crisis of numbers. It is also a crisis of solidarity.”
According to the report, which was released on the UN World Refugee Day, about half of all refugees were children at the end of 2015. The total number of unaccompanied or separated children who applied for asylum worldwide almost tripled, from 34,300 in 2014 to 98,400 in 2015.
The UN blames ongoing civil war in countries including Syria and Sudan, as well as the rise of the Islamic State, for the sharp increase of displaced individuals.
“More people are being displaced by war and persecution, and that’s worrying in itself, but the factors that endanger refugees are multiplying, too,” Filippo Grandi, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, said in a statement.
Grandi also urged the international community to put refugees and asylum seekers before politics.
“The willingness of nations to work together not just for refugees but for the collective human interest is what’s being tested today, and it’s this spirit of unity that badly needs to prevail,” he said."

He shares a photograph of the setup: eight students and Khalf gather around a table that overflows with chopped vegetables, tomatoes and flowers. A single fan on the wall pushes against the heat of the camp, which can reach above 100 degrees Fahrenheit in June.
This is one portrait of artistic expression in Zaatari refugee camp, where approximately 80,000 Syrians live, having fled the devastating five-year war there that has killed more than 400,000 people.
Photo by Mohamad Khalf
Khalf, 25, photographs life in Zaatari while teaching photography workshops to other refugees. In his work, daily expressions of ritual and joy — a line of men praying, children playing — are juxtaposed with barbed wire and the ashes of burned structures. All of this, he said, forms a part of the Syrian story.
“The picture is a letter to the world,” he said in a Facebook message. “The world should know what [makes] people Syrian.”
Khalf arrived in Zaatari in March 2013, almost a year after his brother was killed in Damascus by forces loyal to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, according to Khalf.
Once at Zaatari, Khalf met Brendan Bannon, an American photographer who teaches workshops in the camp with a grant from the UN.
Khalf loved photography for years and had shot sporting events in Syria using a camera phone or a friend’s Nikon, when he could borrow it. But during the fall of 2014, he took those skills further by training with Bannon and working as a course assistant in two of the workshops that Bannon taught.
“It was great to see the way that [Khalf] supported the students in every way imaginable,” Bannon said. “He would meet the youngest, and walk them through the camp to class to be sure they were there safe and on time. He took notes on everything that happened, all of the discussions and lessons were recorded in his notebook for future use.”
After Bannon’s workshops ended, Khalf began teaching on his own. In November of 2014, his photographs of sports in Zaatari were featured on The New York Times’ website.

The workshops are just one corner of an artistic scene that has developed in Zaatari amid wrenching living conditions, from excessive heat to a lack of water and electricity. Internet service is spotty, limiting residents’ contact with the outside world.
Based on population, the camp could be the fourth-largest city in Jordan — but it lacks the infrastructure most cities require to support thousands of residents.
In the face of these difficulties, a number of individuals have worked on developing artistic resources for refugees in Zaatari, aware that back in Syria, the militant group calling itself the Islamic State has taken direct aim at the heart of Syrian culture — destroying ancient sites and antiquities.
“I am suffering from the loss of this heritage,” Khalf said, before naming cities where the Islamic State has launched offensives in recent years. “Palmyra. Aleppo. Deir ez-Zor.”

Bannon, who also led photography workshops for refugees in Yemen and Namibia in 2008, said he believes an outlet for creative expression can serve as a lifeline for some refugees.
“Self expression and creative problem-solving are important to children and youth anywhere in the world,” Bannon said. “For refugees who have endured the trauma of war and have been uprooted and separated from everything they knew, it is even more essential.”

Like a number of Syrians, Khalf ascribes the destruction in Syria to both the Islamic State and Assad’s troops, and said his camera is a tool of cultural survival. “I take a picture of my heritage before it becomes devastated by Daesh [and] Assad,” he said, using a pejorative term for the Islamic State.
Bannon said that art by refugees also helps foster a public understanding of the situation across borders. “Hearing from refugees like Mohamad is essential,” he said. “Being witness to the creativity and individuality we see through their expression encourages people to see the person, not the statistic or label.”

Uganda has hosted refugees since the first influx of Rwandans in 1959, and now has more than 500,000 refugees from Rwanda, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Somalia, South Sudan and elsewhere, said Alexander Betts, a professor of forced migration and international affairs at Oxford University.
Uganda “quickly recognized that, with large amounts of unoccupied arable land, it could benefit from allowing refugees the right to work in under-populated rural areas.”
The refugees work as farmers, taxi drivers and run Internet cafes. They generally do not need formal work permits, and their refugee status documents entitle them to work, he said.
“From Kenya to Uganda to Tanzania to Thailand, in all of these contexts, we see refugees helping themselves and their communities when they’re given opportunities,” Betts told PBS NewsHour special correspondent Fred de Sam Lazaro in an April interview.
In Uganda’s capital Kampala, 20 percent of refugee-owned businesses have at least one employee. Of those employed, 40 percent are citizens of the host country, said Betts. (Read more of his research.)
“These (refugees) are often people with skills, talents, aspirations,” he said. “If we don’t recognize their skills, if we don’t give them the training opportunities, if we don’t offer them the right to work, they end up appearing to be a burden.”
But in places like Lebanon, the refugees could flood the job market. Lebanon has a population of 4 million and is hosting about 1.2 million refugees.
“Out of every four Lebanese, one is Syrian,” Antoine Frem, mayor of the coastal city of Jounieh in Lebanon, said in September at the U.S. Institute of Peace. (You can watch his full presentation.)
The Lebanese government is struggling to balance the needs of employers looking for workers and Lebanese citizens with whom the refugees are competing for jobs.

In Lebanon, private companies can hire documented refugees. “All the construction sites have Syrian workers,” said Frem. But state-run institutions, such as public schools, cannot hire refugees because they are not enrolled in the Social Security and national benefits system, he said.
“The Syrian refugees are replacing the Lebanese workforce in many places. You go to restaurants now, and the waiter serving you has a Syrian accent,” said Frem. “This is creating a job loss for Lebanese. And many of the Lebanese now, especially the talented ones, are emigrating.”
In other countries, such as in Europe nations, which have much fewer refugees, people are wary of the newcomers for other reasons, said Betts.
“There’s a lot of fear from people who don’t necessarily meet refugees in their day-to-day life, but who read newspaper stories and end up with … a fear of foreigners, a fear of the unknown,” he said.

The International Olympic Committee on Friday revealed the names of the athletes who will join the first ever multinational refugee team. They include two swimmers, two judo fighters, one marathoner and five short-distant runners.
“When it comes to sport, there is no difference between a refugee or a Syrian,” Rami Anis, a 24-year-old Syrian swimmer on Team Refugee, said in an IOC statement. “When it comes to sport, you just have to compete to be at the top.”
The IOC said its main priority is assisting the athletes that need it most, and to place them on equal footing with their competitors in more developed regions of the world. As of June 2015, there are 59.5 million displaced people around the world, 19.5 million refugees, and 10 million stateless people, according to United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
“These refugees have no home, no team, no flag, no national anthem,” IOC President Thomas Bach said. “These refugee athletes will show the world that despite the unimaginable tragedies that they have faced, anyone can contribute to society through their talent, skills and strength of the human spirit.”
Among those competing is 17-year-old Yusra Mardini, who fled from Syria to Turkey and then to Lesbos. When the boat she was traveling on with 20 other people started taking on water, Mardini and her sister got into the water and swam the vessel to safety. Mardini is currently training in Berlin.

Popole Misenga and Yolande Mabika both fled from Democratic Republic of the Congo three years ago and found asylum in Brazil. The duo will compete in judo in the Olympic Games. Both told the Guardian that judo helped them forget the horror of war and the sadness of leaving families and loved ones behind.
“I have to fight well to take this opportunity that the Olympics gave me,” Misenga said in the Guardian. “I’m going to fight for my home.”
Yonas Kinde is the team’s only long-distance runner. The 36-year-old marathoner from Ethiopia, who now lives in Luxembourg, qualified for the Rio Olympics in October 2015 during the Frankfurt Marathon.
But half of the athletes on Team Refugee will be short-distance runners from South Sudan who are now training in Kenya. Yiech Pur Biel, 21, James Nyang Chiengjiek, 28, Anjelina Nada Lohalith, 21, Rose Nathike Lokonyen, 23, and Paulo Amotun Lokoro, 24, were all refugees at Kakuma Camp that houses approximately 300,000 refugees in northwest Kenya.
For all the struggles these refugees have faced, Chiengjiek said he hopes to give back in honor of those who helped him get to the Olympics.
“My dream is to help people,” Chiengjiek said. “Without support I cannot be so because I’ve been supported by someone, I want to be able to support someone.”
At the games, the team will enter the stadium carrying the Olympic flag as their symbol, and the Olympic Anthem will be played at medal ceremonies.
The IOC said it will pay for the team’s expenses for travel and uniforms. The coaches will be provided as part of its pledge to aid potential elites athletes affected by the worldwide refugee crisis."

Citing a finance ministry draft document, Der Spiegel magazine, which is based in Hamburg, reported that the Germany took in approximately 1.1 million refugees last year and is predicting that 600,000 refugees will enter the country this year. Then 400,000 are expected next year and 300,000 per year for the following years. Most of the migrants are coming from Syria and other war zones.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel has divided Germans with an open-door policy that has attracted more recent Syrian migrants than any other European country. A poll earlier this year indicated that Germans are becoming more skeptical of refugees, as an anti-immigration movement gains more support and attacks against refugee shelters continue.
The costs associated with refugees will rise from 16.1 billion euros this year to 20.4 billion in 2020, according to the Associated Press, and the statement predicts that more than half of documented refugees will find work within that time.
A finance ministry spokesman declined to comment on the numbers, but said federal officials were aiming to reach an agreement about it by the end of the month, the AP reported."

Stavros Lambrinidis, the EU’s special representative for human rights, said that taking in more refugees would help ease the pressure on Europe, which is facing a massive refugee crisis.
“To the extent that we can all understand this global issue and share the responsibility, this will clearly alleviate the pressure on Europe right now and Greece in particular,” Lambrinidis said at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.
“To our knowledge, there is absolutely no evidence in the case of the US, that giving asylum to people is opening the door to terrorists.”
The U.S. annually accepts 70,000 refugees from around the world. This group includes people fleeing violence, religious persecution and war. The Obama administration announced last year that the number of people invited to move to the U.S. as refugees would be increased to 85,000 in 2016, including about 10,000 Syrians.
Lambrinidis said that while it was important for authorities to be vigilant in screening migrants, the anti-refugee rhetoric that is on the rise in the U.S. and the EU is alarming and undermines the countries’ international obligations.
Europe has seen a rise of far-right parties fueled by the refugee crisis and terrorist attacks in European capitals. In the U.S., Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump has called for temporarily barring Muslims from entering the country and refusing entry to Syrian refugees.
“The easy rhetoric, the populist rhetoric that we have in Europe or that you have here, that asylum means opening the door to terrorism is something that we have to nip in the bud in my view,” Lambrinidis said. “It’s extremely dangerous and it also endangers our obligation … under international law.”"

The Islamic State launched an attack on the Nusra Front in the Yarmouk camp in south Damascus 11 days ago and the continued violence has made it unsafe for U.N. officials to send food and water.
Supplies from the Palestinian arm of the U.N. were already scarce, and now people are trapped inside their homes, hiding from armed extremists and violence.
A spokesperson for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) said in a statement Saturday that the agency was “greatly alarmed and concerned by the desperate humanitarian consequences being inflicted on civilians.”
“The fighting has been intense, and is taking place in the most densely populated areas of Yarmouk, with the use of heavy weapons, explosive devices and weapons of indiscriminate effect,” UNRWA spokesperson Chris Gunness said.
At less than a square mile, the Yarmouk camp was established in 1957 for Palestinian’s fleeing the Arab-Israeli War. It soon became the biggest Palestinian camp in the Middle East, with at least 150,000 refugees living in it.
But thousands have died or fled since it was ravaged by the Islamic State and other extremist groups. Many of the estimated 18,000 who remain are trapped in the latest crossfire and have gone without U.N. supplies for more than a week.
Starvation was already the leading cause of death at the camp in 2014, when Amnesty International reported that the Islamic State was using the tactic as a weapon of war. People there have been foraging for leaves, cats and dogs for years, often surviving without electricity and other essentials.
“Whatever supplies of food and water they had have long been exhausted,” Gunness said. “Civilians are enduring yet another extraordinary episode of deep trauma and abject suffering.”
Calling for a ceasefire so the UNRWA can continue deliveries, the agency stated that it is “anxiously monitoring the situation and will maintain in the strongest terms its demands for the safety and protection of civilians in Yarmouk.”"

He said the decision to bring the 12 Syrian refugees to Italy was a humanitarian gesture, not a political act.
The families, whose houses had been bombed, had arrived in Greece before an agreement made in March to to deport asylum-seekers who reach European shores. The 12 refugees will be cared for the by the Holy See.
The pope’s visit to the island was a plea for morality and sympathy, a “gesture of welcome,” according to a statement released by the Vatican.
The six adults and six children chosen through negotiations between Greek and Italian authorities are among hundreds of thousands of migrants seeking refuge in Europe.
“Migrants, rather than simply being a statistic, are first of all persons who have faces, names and individual stories,” he said in a speech during a ceremony at the port of Lesbos. “Europe is the homeland of human rights.”

Many people wept at his feet at the Moria refugee detention center where he and two Orthodox leaders greeted more than 200 individually while some in the crowd chanted “Freedom! Freedom!” according to the Associated Press.
“The world will be judged by the way it has treated you. And we will all be accountable for the way we respond to the crisis and conflict in the regions that you come from,” the pope said.
Francis is the son of Italian immigrants and was born in Argentina.
The Vatican said the pope also met with the Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras of Greece during his visit to talk about the migration crisis and the need to protect people who risk their lives crossing the Aegean and Mediterranean Seas.
“The Pope has appreciated the humane stance of the Greek people, who despite harsh economic strains have shown solidarity and commitment to universal values,” the statement said."

Welcoming in refugees turned around Utica’s economic decline.
For Making Sen$e’s latest segment, economics correspondent Paul Solman spoke to economist Jeffrey Sachs, director of the Earth Institute at Columbia University and a senior UN advisor, about the economic impact of refugees in America as well as in Utica specifically.
You can read that conversation below. For more on the topic, tune in to tonight’s Making Sen$e segment, which airs every Thursday on the PBS NewsHour. The following text has been edited for clarity and length.
— Kristen Doerer, Making Sen$e Editor
Paul Solman: What’s the economic impact of refugees in America? Positive? Negative?
Jeffrey Sachs: For the world, it’s positive, because people are leaving desperate situations and getting to economically better situations. For the U.S., on net, it’s positive, because there are gains when people come, add to the labor market, add skills and generally, earn less than what they can contribute to the society as a whole. So there are benefits, but there are distributional consequences that can be quite complicated.
READ MORE: Column: I, too, once sought refuge
Paul Solman: And what are they?
Jeffrey Sachs: The distributional consequences come in two kinds. First, some workers face increased job competition, and their wages can be driven down. If lower skilled immigrants come, then lower skilled American workers may see a decline in their wages, whereas business owners may see more workers at lower cost for them.
The second kind of distributional consequence is that migrants get social services. And if they pay less in taxes and receive social services, that’s kind of a tax on the rest of the society. So economists point to both the labor market impacts and to the fiscal impacts.
Paul Solman: If refugees come and go to work, aren’t they paying in more than they’re getting out?
Jeffrey Sachs: What happens depends a lot on who the refugees are, their family structure, if they are lower skilled and in a place where there are lots of social services. If they are coming with large dependent families, maybe they are net recipients. If they are highly skilled workers and relatively young, they are almost surely net contributors. The more one studies this, the more one sees all different kinds of effects.
Paul Solman: From what I’ve read and seen, the refugees that are coming now are more well-educated and better off than the typical person in the countries they are leaving. And they are young, so when they come to America, they don’t receive as many social services as they would if they were older. For a while, this must be a real net plus.
Refugees are escaping with their lives, and we have a duty, a human right and an international legal duty to help them survive.
Jeffrey Sachs: Of course it depends country by country, circumstance by circumstance. The United States, for example, is very different from the situation we see in Greece, which is the receiving end of hundreds of thousands of Syrian refugees. Those who make it to the United States might be better off. They may require air travel, and they may have family connections. Of course, migrants fleeing violence in Central America or Mexico and so forth are also quite different from the Syrian refugees that come to the United States by plane and who are officially classified as refugees.
When one looks in depth at this issue, almost all strong claims — certainly the hysterical anti-immigrant claims, but all plus claims too — have to be taken with more care.
READ MORE: How migrants and refugees are being welcomed in one tiny Italian village
Now, one more thing to add: We often speak as if the only thing we think about is: What does it means for us? But refugees are escaping with their lives, and we have a duty, a human right and an international legal duty to help them survive. We have to have a holistic view of what it means for the people involved. What does it mean for the so-called destination country? What does it mean for the so-called source country?
Paul Solman: In Utica, educated refugees have become active members of the labor force. The city loves refugees, because they are halting the city’s economic decline.
Jeffrey Sachs: I think it’s wonderful that a city loves refugees, because there’s also decency in that, in the acceptance of people fleeing from extreme danger and being welcomed. This is extremely important. Second, this city clearly sees that there are general gains for that community and for the local society, and that’s also quite realistic. I’m sure there are some tensions even within Utica, and we shouldn’t think Utica’s experience means that a complete open door would be easily accepted, but I do think that it’s a positive harbinger.
READ MORE: Uncertain times for refugees on the migrant trail in Greece
If the borders were simply opened and anybody could go where they want, I don’t think this would work very well actually, because hundreds of millions of people would be on the move and would overwhelm budgets and social services and even the community. So the issue of how to pace and time migration is one of the big open questions. Nobody has a formula for it. At the international level, there is no agreement on any of these issues. The only agreement internationally is that when people are fleeing persecution, fleeing for their lives, there is a human right for them to escape, and there is a responsibility for countries not to send them back to danger.
Paul Solman: And yet that responsibility is being ignored consistently all around the world.
Jeffrey Sachs: Right now everyone is saying “We don’t want these refugees. We’re not returning them to the war zones perhaps, but stay out of our country.” But it can add up to very much the same thing. So the international system is almost without a system right now. It’s everybody on their own. It’s very dangerous. We do have international agreements and commitments. We have the Geneva Convention, and we have responsibilities, and the United States, which has been a party to Middle Eastern wars and politics and is part of this Syrian reality and this Syrian story, has a legal as well as a moral obligation to take in more refugees.
Paul Solman: We’re very loath to do.
Jeffrey Sachs: Right now, there’s more hysteria and anti-migrant, anti-refugee feeling. There’s a sense among many responsible people, “What does this have to do with us?” And they don’t understand how much the United States has been involved in these wars and has been part of stoking up this disaster and then saying, “Nah. We have no responsibility.”
Paul Solman: For years, you’ve argued that what happens abroad matters to people here in the United States; the disease festers there will come here. If unrest festers there, we will have to do something about it that might threaten us in some way. Is there an analogous concern on your part with respect to the current refugee crisis?
Jeffrey Sachs: Absolutely. We are so interconnected, whether it’s Ebola, whether it’s climate change or whether it’s refugees. This is one interconnected society. But in the case of refugees, it’s even more than that, because it’s not just something that’s happening and then the United States feels the impact. The United States is one of the main protagonists of the wars in the Middle East. And so our responsibility, our role in all of this violence is much more direct. The more one understands the details of that, the more one should say, “Of course, the United States will play its role and its responsibility in helping people flee for their lives.”"

It was through writing letters that she and her husband Leo, an American soldier, fell in love in the aftermath of World War II.
She was working in a photography shop in a Bavarian village, and he was looking for a place to develop prints of the region’s majestic palaces.
Helga and her mother had fled the bombing in Berlin after her father died in the air raids. A relative in Bavaria opened his home to them and planted Helga at the shop’s front counter to deal with the American soldiers, since she knew a few words of English.
“I bluffed my way through,” she recalled recently, speaking with a soft German accent.
“I heard her say, ‘how many prints, please?’ It grew from there,” said Leo from their Colorado Springs, Colorado home.
They first met in October 1945. Leo soon returned to the United States to go to college but continued to send Helga letters and her family care packages of flour, sugar, chocolate bars, and dried milk and eggs.
“Opening it was like manna from heaven,” said Helga. After the war, food was scarce. Helga’s family foraged grass from nearby fields to make soup. They stretched the goodies in those care packages as long as they could.
In 1948, Helga joined Leo in the United States, and on Aug. 7 they wed.
When people from CARE, a nonprofit founded in 1945 that provides disaster relief around the world, found out that Leo had sent care packages through their organization and had a wife who came from Germany, they asked if she would like to write a letter to a Syrian refugee.
Helga, now 87, said “yes” right away. “Being a refugee myself so many years ago, I could instantly sympathize with what it would be like to leave your home behind and be in that position.”

Syria’s civil war, which hits the five-year mark on March 15, has been called the worst humanitarian crisis since World War II. So far, 4.8 million Syrians have escaped to neighboring countries and Europe. (See the latest refugee numbers from the United Nations here.)
It’s an overwhelming situation, and human connections help people survive. CARE put five former World War II refugees in touch with five Syrian refugee children living in Jordan as part of a letter-writing program. (You can read all of the letters here.)
Helga was just 16 when she and her mother had to leave Berlin, cram onto a crowded train and enter an unfamiliar place. “When you’re that young, you want to lead an ordinary life. And to be taken away from that overnight was a very frightening experience.”
Her letter went to Sajeda, also 16, who lives in an apartment in Jordan with her mother, two younger sisters and two younger brothers.
“I wrote that I could identify with her, what she was going through. I told her not to give up and be brave, don’t fear the future. And look forward to each day. Even in horrible circumstances, think of something to look forward to each day,” said Helga.
When Sajeda received the letter and it was translated to her, she was filled with emotion and began to cry, according to the nonprofit.
“That would be my reaction if I received a letter,” Helga said. “That somewhere out there in this great big world there’s a person who thinks of me at that time.”"

Regan,Thousands of stranded refugees stage protest at Greece-Macedonia border,"Hundreds of migrants trapped at a refugee camp along Greece’s border with Macedonia staged protests for a second day, temporarily shutting down a rail line for several hours on Sunday.
Roughly 300 migrants are stuck along the border crossing waiting to enter Macedonia, which in recent days has installed stricter border restrictions against migrants. The protest forced a cargo train to turn back.

Many of the protesters are from Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan, while more than 6,500 refugees are living in a tented camp nearby and thousands more spread across Greece.
Macedonia on Saturday allowed 300 Syrian and Iraqi refugees to enter the country, but has limited the number allowed across the border overall in an attempt to slow the migration of refugees with more than 1 million entering Europe in 2015 alone.
Macedonia’s decision follows similar efforts in Serbia, Croatia and Slovenia to restrict the flow of refugees. Hungary has taken its restrictions a step further, constructing a miles-long fence along the Serbian and Croatian border with plans to construct additional obstructions along its border with Romania, the Associated Press reported.
“We will protect ourselves all the way from Slovania to Ukraine,” said Prime Minister Viktor Orban on Sunday to the AP, also blaming Germany’s liberal migration policy as the cause of the once heavily trafficked route through Hungary.

With the new border policies, tens of thousands of refugees, mostly from Syria are now creating a bottleneck along the Greek border.
“We estimate that in our country the number of those trapped will be from 50,000-70,000 people next month,” said Greek Migration Minister Yiannis Mouzalas.
On Friday, United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon lodged his own complaints against the Balkan countries, and others, for installing border restrictions that violate the 1951 U.N. Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees.
“The Secretary-General notes that the number of asylum seekers entering Greece from Turkey continues unabated, and that the border closures are creating a difficult situation in Greece,” Ban’s spokesperson wrote in a statement. “He calls on all countries to keep their borders open, and to act in a spirit of responsibility sharing and solidarity, including through expanding legal pathways to access asylum.”"

As a political activist, Ai has often used his art to comment on the Chinese government and human rights issues. After government-constructed schools collapsed during the 2008 Sichuan earthquake, killing more than 5,000 students, Ai pushed the government to take accountability for the deaths with an installation listing the names of children that were killed. He also served as the artistic consultant Swiss architects, Jacques Herzog and Pierre de Meuron while they designed the Beijing Stadium for the 2008 Olympics.
Ai was arrested in 2011 by the Chinese government and held for 81 days without any official charges filed against him. The government also retained his passport for four years until returning it last July. He moved to Berlin, which has recently become a haven for some of the more than 4.7 million people who have fled war in Syria.
Here are five times Ai has used his work to comment on the refugee situation.

Ai wrapped the columns of Berlin’s Konzerthaus with 14,000 salvaged refugee life vests on Feb. 13. The temporary installment was created for the Cinema for Peace Gala, where Ai served as honorary president this year. At the gala event, Ai asked the room of high-profile celebrities like Charlize Theron to don thermal blankets and take selfies, according to The Guardian.
People walk past the ‘Circle of Animals / Zodiac Heads’ sculptures by Chinese artist Ai Weiwei in front of the Trade Fair Palace run by the National Gallery on Feb. 5, 2016 in Prague, Czech Republic.
Earlier this month in Prague, Weiwei wrapped golden thermal blankets around the his Zodiac animal heads sculptures on display in front of the National Gallery’s Trade and Fair Palace. The Zodiac heads, which represent the 12 signs of the Chinese zodiac, are part of a multi-year touring exhibition that launched in New York City in May 2011.
For the exhibition, Ai explored the design of fake and copied Zodiac heads, whose design dates back to the 18th century. The exhibition arrived in Prague in February and will be there through August. Ai described his display as a “gesture in defending the dignity of refugees.” The exhibition will run through Aug. 31.

In protest of the new law that enables authorities to seize assets of asylum seekers as they enter Denmark, Ai closed down his exhibition, “Ruptures,” at the Faurschou Foundation in Copenhagen in January.
“I cannot co-exist, I cannot stand in front of these people, and see these policies,” he told the Guardian. “It is a personal act, very simple; an artist trying not just to watch events but to act, and I made this decision spontaneously.”
Jen Faurschou, who owns the Faurschou Foundation, supported Ai’s decision. The exhibition in Copenhagen was expected to close in mid-April.
“This is not so much about which country does more or less for refugees, it is the symbolic importance of the new law,” Faurschou told the Guardian. “This [kind of thing] is spreading over Europe, and we in Denmark are taking the lead in this by making this law.

Ai organized a march in London that took place on Sept. 17, 2015, with Anish Kapoor, a British-Indian sculptor. The two walked eight miles hand-in-hand from the Royal Academy of Arts to the Orbit, an event they called a “walk of compassion,” with more than 100 followers.
“This problem has such a long history, a human history. We are all refugees somehow, somewhere and at some moment,” he told The Guardian. “We are trying to do positive action: by opening a certain spirit, a certain poetic space, we can at least hope to change how we think about the problem.”

Ai collaborated with photographer Rohit Chawla from India Today to recreate the now-famous image of Aylan Kurdi, a Syrian toddler who drowned off the coast of Turkey. Nilüfer Demir’s photo of Kurdi quickly swept across the Internet, drawing new attention to the refugee crisis. Ai also established a studio on the Greek island of Lesbos, a key point of entry into Europe for thousands of refugees."

Installation began on Museo Atlantico — the latest project of underwater sculptor James deCaires Taylor — this week, 14 meters underwater in Lanzarote, one of the Spain’s Canary Islands off the coast of West Africa. Taylor, whose creations have spanned the waters from the Bahamas to London, calls it the first underwater contemporary art museum in Europe and the Atlantic Ocean.
The “museum” will consist of several different installations. The first, “The Raft of Lampedusa,” shows a group of people huddled in a raft in an homage to French Romantic painter Théodore Géricault’s painting “The Raft of the Medusa.” The piece references Europe’s current refugee crisis, according to a statement on the project.
“The work is not intended as a tribute or memorial to the many lives lost but as a stark reminder of the collective responsibility of our now global community,” Taylor wrote.
The museum’s main installation, titled “Rubicon,” gathers a collection of 35 people in contemporary clothing who are walking toward a gate — “a point of no return or a portal to another world,” Taylor wrote. The figures appear vacant, unaware of the gate that lies ahead of them, a scene meant to raise awareness of environmental threats to the ocean. At least one pair is taking a selfie.
Taylor uses marine-grade cement with pH-neutral concrete that is nontoxic to local wildlife, and over time the statues increase marine biomass by accumulating coral on their surfaces. Each piece has a foundation plate that can be drilled and anchored to the sea floor. “They’re designed to not move in strong currents or storms, so they have to be very solid,” he told NewsHour.
Then, he works with a team of divers to install them. Taylor provided video of this week’s installation process off the coast of Lanzarote, whose government commissioned and financed the project.

Taylor, who began exploring Malaysia’s coral reefs as a child, has a history of sinking his creations below water. His piece “Viccisitudes” (2006), a collection of sculpted figures clustered in a circle, sits 15 feet below the waves in Molinière Bay, Grenada, West Indies.
In 2009, Taylor, along with Jaime Gonzalez Cano of Mexico’s National Marine Park and Roberto Diaz of the Cancún Nautical Association, launched a project to create what The Guardian called “the only underwater museum in the world.” The Museo Subacuático de Arte is located in the National Marine Park of Punta Cancún, Isla de Mujeres and Punta Nizuc.
The installations, which consist of more than 500 figures in an area of 420 square meters and weigh more than 200 tons total, are meant to help preserve the surrounding barrier reef by helping draw visitor attention in another direction, according to a statement on Taylor’s website. Taylor cast some of the figures with help from locals in the nearby Mexican village of Puerto Morelos. Other artists contributed to the museum, including Roberto Díaz Abraham, Salvador Quiroz Ennis, Rodrigo Quiñones Reyes, Karen Salinas Martínez and Enrique Mireles.
In 2014, when Taylor installed his 40-ton piece “Ocean Atlas” in the Bahamas, it became the world’s largest underwater sculpture to date. In tandem with the Bahamas Reef Environment Educational Foundation, Taylor said the sculpture’s purpose was to draw attention to the effects of climate change and overfishing on the oceans. And last summer, he placed “The Rising Tide,” a sculpture depiction of the four horsemen of the apocalypse, on the banks of London’s Vauxhall Bridge so that it would be visible twice a day during low tide.
Taylor said that he hopes the museum will draw people to explore what’s hidden beneath the Atlantic surface.
The Canary Islands are “surrounded by blue everywhere, but people don’t have a great understanding of what’s actually happening beneath the surface,” he said. “I hope most of the works can be an entrance point, or a portal, where people will get to know what an amazing place the underwater world is, and will hopefully inspire them to protect it.”
“They’re all designed to change and evolve in the ecosystem where they’re placed,” Taylor told NPR. “And sometimes that provides spectacular results. You know, we get sort of pink and purple corals and sponges and fire coral and tunicate — all these amazing things growing on them, morphing them. That only adds to them. They really sort of then become alive.”
The museum will open to scuba divers on Feb. 25, 2016, and Taylor plans to complete it by January 2017.

But the ancient city was still standing in the winter of 2014 when Mahmoud Hariri began recreating it in clay and wood.
Hariri, 25, was working on a project with Art from Zaatari, an artists’ group located in Jordan’s Zaatari refugee camp. The camp, located just a few miles from the country’s border with Syria, has in the past few years become a city unto itself — with approximately 80,000 people living there; it has schools, clinics and mosques.
And, of course, artists. The group decided to create small sculptures that replicated Syrian monuments, knowing their real-life counterparts stood in the path of warring forces. Hariri chose Palmyra, the ancient city whose ruins formed a UNESCO World Heritage Site and hosted some of the best-preserved Roman antiquities in the world.

He began marking out, inch by inch, the details of a city in miniature. Having worked as an art teacher in Syria before he left, Hariri methodically worked with kebab skewers and miniature bricks of clay to recreate the columns of a city thousands of years old. “I wanted to show my country’s history and culture to the world,” he told me via Facebook.
But in the spring of 2015, just a few months after he began, the Islamic State group invaded the city, and within weeks the piece had become a reminder of what was lost. The group destroyed irreplaceable artifacts, the historic Temple of Bel and at least six tombs, in addition to other ancient sites. The damage was devastating to Syrians and scholars around the world.
Hariri said he wanted Palmyra to stay visible even as parts of it lay in ruins.
“Syrian identity is important to me. I participated in this project so this identity did not become erased,” he said.
As war in Syria pushes millions of people out of the country, Zaatari has developed into a kind of metropolis itself, one beset by problems — former residents have spoken out about difficult living conditions, including a a lack of electricity, water and other services. People who initially expected to be there for months have lived there for years, including some children who were born in the camp. Many will not, for the foreseeable future at least, see any of Syria’s most treasured sites in person.
This was all on Ahmad Hariri’s mind when he decided to organize Art from Zaatari, inspired by the work he saw by his friends in the camp. A 31-year-old network engineer that has lived in the camp since April 2013, Ahmad is not an artist himself. “The artists are my friends, so I started to follow their work,” he said via Facebook.
Ahmad and most of the eight artists working on the project are from Dara’a, the southern city where a harsh government crackdown on protests in early 2011 is credited with fanning the early flames of the revolution.
Ahmad Hariri, who initially brought the group together and helps source their materials, says the project can help educate children in the camp about their homeland. “There are lots of kids living here who have never seen Syria or who have no memory of it. They know more about Jordan than about their own country,” he told Dunmore. Photo © UNHCR/Christopher Herwig
Iyad Sabagh, 29, arrived in Zaatari from Dara’a in late April 2013. He said he wanted to help preserve Syrian culture however he could. “The war is ruining these historical sites,” he said via Facebook.
For months, the artists used whatever materials they could find to create the sculptures: scrap wood, plaster of Paris, stones. Sabagh created a model of Deir ez-Zor suspension bridge, a bridge that once crossed the Euphrates River in the eastern city of Deir ez-Zur, using sticks. The bridge was destroyed in shelling in May 2013.

Hariri also recreated the Bosra Theater, an ancient Roman theater located in Dara’a, and the Statue of Saladin, a historic statue in Damascus.
Sabagh said he wanted future generations of Syrian children to know what the monuments looked like. “We want to introduce the next generation of children to Syria’s civilization and history,” he said. “We have the right to preserve the history of our ancestors.”

The project also had two additional stages, according to organizer Ahmad. In the second stage, artists created various types of Syrian folk art in paintings, drawings and multimedia pieces. “The artwork in this exhibit attempts to capture ancient Syrian folk traditions, some of which continue [in] the daily lives of modern Syrians,” he said.
In the third stage, artists chose whatever medium they wanted — paint, sculpture or multimedia — to address the war in Syria, he said. In that stage, the group wanted to show that “the loser in this war is not only Syria, but also all the world,” he said. “We hope that our voice reaches into the world to stop the war.”
For the second and third stages, Hariri created 7 paintings using acrylic and oil, and drawings using ink and pencil. Sabagh created 21 paintings, including 4 pieces using pencil, 4 oil paintings, and 13 acrylic paintings. The group displayed its work at a community center in Zaatari in December.
Photographer Chris Herwig and journalist Charlie Dunmore met the artists while producing a story on the project for the UNHCR. Herwig said he wanted to “capture their relationship with what they were creating.”
Dunmore, who interviewed the artists, said the project showed determination among the artists living in Zaatari. “To keep doing the thing that you love, whatever materials you have to work with, just shows resilience,” he said.

After debating for more than three hours, the bill was adopted in a 81-27 vote with support from the Social Democrats, a left-leaning opposition party, and the anti-immigrant Danish People’s Party. One lawmaker abstained from voting and 70 others were absent.
Items of “sentimental value,” such as wedding rings, are exceptions to what refugees are required to hand over to the government, “unless they have considerable value.” Mia Tang, press spokesperson for Denmark’s’ Ministry of Immigration, Integration, and Housing told Vox in an email in December.
Authorities, however, can confiscate valuable items like watches, mobile phones and computers. The law applies to refugees entering Denmark and those who are already there.
The Danish ruling party first announced the idea in December. The initial draft of the law included a lower threshold — around $436 — and didn’t include any exceptions to confiscated items.
Supporters of the bill argued Denmark needed to address the influx of refugees. Denmark accepted 15,000 asylum-seekers in 2015, BBC reported. The country expects to accept another 20,000 this year.
“To those saying what we are doing is wrong, my question is: What is your alternative?” Social Democrat Dan Jorgensen said during the parliamentary debate. “The alternative is that we continue to be [one of] the most attractive countries in Europe to come to, and then we end up like Sweden,” he said.
The United Nations criticized the move.
Spokesman for the U.N. secretary-general, Stephane Dujarric, said people who move to Europe “should be treated with compassion and respect.”
Denmark has become the latest European state to have refugees hand over their personal valuables in order to pay for their stay, The Guardian reported. Germany’s southern states have similar seizure laws and Switzerland requires refugees to hand over assets larger than 1,000 francs, or $996.
Danish lawmakers passed a raft of measures Tuesday meant to tighten existing asylum laws. One such measure extended the waiting period from one to three years for refugees to apply for family members to join them. Other laws, passed last year, included shortening temporary residence permits and stepping up efforts to deport those whose applications were rejected."

Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid says Republicans refused to allow Democrats to offer amendments to the bill. One of those could have put Republicans on the spot in an election year by forcing them to take sides for or against GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump.
Trump has called for barring Muslims from coming to the U.S.
The Senate fell short of the three-fifths needed to move ahead. The vote was 55-43.
The House legislation would require new FBI background checks and individual sign-offs from three high-ranking federal officials before any refugee from Syria or Iraq could come to the United States."
https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/senate-to-consider-bill-on-screening-procedures-for-refugees,refugee,716,2016-01-16T15:53:45-05:00,"Richard Lardner, Associated Press",Senate to consider bill on screening procedures for refugees,"WASHINGTON — The Senate will consider new rigorous screening procedures for Syrian and Iraqi refugees seeking to enter the United States as national security looms large for voters in an election year.
Propelled by the Islamic State group’s attacks in Paris, the GOP-backed legislation raced through the House last November with 289 votes. That veto-proof margin included 47 Democrats despite the Obama administration’s opposition to the measure.
The legislation will have a much harder time making it through the Senate in the week ahead.
Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., needs at least six Democrats to join all 54 Republicans to approve a motion clearing the bill for final passage in the 100-member chamber.
The Senate’s top Democrat, Harry Reid of Nevada, said last year that was not going to happen. Even if it did, President Barack Obama has pledged to veto the bill if it got to him.
The upshot may be more of the same on Capitol Hill: A war of words, with Republicans blasting Obama for failing to do what they see as necessary to secure the United States and Democrats accusing the GOP of fearmongering to score points with voters.
Some of the key points to know about the Syrian-Iraqi refugee legislation:
WHAT THE HOUSE BILL DOES
IS controls territory in Syria and Iraq. As a result of the extremists’ harsh, uncompromising rule, people in those areas have tried to flee and make it to the United States. The House-passed American Security Against Foreign Enemies Act is rooted in concerns the current process of screening refugee is inadequate and could allow a terrorist to be admitted into the United States.
The legislation would order FBI background checks for Syrian and Iraqi refugees and require that the FBI, Homeland Security Department and the director of National Intelligence certify that each refugee is not a security threat. The bill’s requirements would effectively suspend admissions of Syrian and Iraqi refugees.
Republicans pointed to the arrest this month of two Iraqi refugees with suspected links to terrorism as one more example of the flawed vetting system.
Over the past few months, voters’ concerns about terrorism have surged and their confidence in the government’s ability to defeat IS and other extremist groups has plummeted, according to a national survey conducted in December by the Pew Research Center.
“I think there’s a sense we need to do everything we can to demonstrate we take seriously the responsibility to protect the country,” Republican Sen. John Thune of South Dakota, a member of the GOP leadership, said last week at a party retreat in Baltimore.
A PROMISE TO VETO
The White House said Obama would veto the House bill. The legislation “would provide no meaningful additional security for the American people,” it said in a Nov. 18 statement.
Refugees of all nationalities, including Syrians and Iraqis, already face a demanding screening process, and the legislation “would unacceptably hamper our efforts to assist some of the most vulnerable people in the world,” the statement said. The White House said more than 2,100 Syrian refugees have been admitted to the United States since 2001 and not one has been arrested or deported on terrorism-related grounds.
‘DON’T WORRY, IT WON’T GET PASSED’
After the House passed the bill Nov. 19, Reid predicted it would die in the Senate. “Don’t worry, it won’t get passed,” Reid told reporters.
A final decision on how the Democrats will proceed is expected on Wednesday at their weekly caucus meeting.
Without support from Democrats, the math doesn’t work for McConnell. He needs a half-dozen Democrats to pass a motion to proceed and eventually allow a vote on the legislation. Thirteen more Democrats would be needed to reach a veto-proof tally.
Despite Reid’s optimism, the House vote demonstrated that opposing the legislation can be dicey for Democrats facing tight 2016 elections. Before the House vote, White House aides went to the Capitol to win over Democrats. Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney, D-N.Y., told them, in a forceful exchange, that voting “no” could hurt Democrats at the polls.
Sen. Jack Reed, D-R.I., said other steps should include addressing illegal immigration more broadly and barring the sale of guns to people on federal terrorism watch lists – a move the Senate recently rejected.

Caldwell, Associated Press",U.S. turns to U.N. to screen refugees from Central America,"WASHINGTON — The Obama administration is planning to expand a program to let would-be migrants from Central America apply for refugee status before they attempt to come to the U.S., Secretary of State John Kerry said Wednesday.
The office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees will now conduct initial screenings to see whether migrants from Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala may qualify as refugees eligible to come to the United States legally.
“I am pleased to announce plans to expand the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program to help vulnerable families and individuals from El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras, and offer them a safe and legal alternative to the dangerous journey many are currently tempted to begin, making them easy prey for human smugglers who have no interest but their own profits,” Kerry said in a speech at the National Defense University.
In December 2014, the U.S. began offering refugee status to children in those countries who have parents already living legally in the United States. So far thousands of children have applied for the program but only a handful of children have been approved to come to the U.S.
The latest effort is aimed at expanding that program by moving applicants, both families and single individuals, into safe zones to await processing.
Refugee processing for Central Americans was launched as part of a broader effort to curb the unprecedented surge of families and children traveling alone caught at the Mexican border in recent years.
During the 2014 budget year, more than 67,000 children were apprehended, along with more than 68,000 people traveling as families. The majority of immigrants in both groups were from Central America.
The flow of Central American children and families declined during the 2015 budget year but border agents have noted significant rise in the numbers of immigrants from both groups in recent months. Since October, more than 16,000 children traveling alone and more than 20,800 people traveling as families have been caught."

WASHINGTON — A Syrian scientist stricken with cancer and seeking a new start for his family in Michigan will represent Syrian refugees as a guest of first lady Michelle Obama for the president’s final State of the Union address.
President Barack Obama has committed to accepting an additional 10,000 Syrian refugees, but some Republican lawmakers and presidential candidates are critical of the expansion. Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz, for example, noted the recent arrest of two Iraqi refugees. During an interview with CNN that aired Sunday, Cruz emphasized that they came to the United States “using the same vetting that President Obama wants us to trust with Syrian refugees.”
Refaai Hamo, his son and three daughters landed at Detroit Metropolitan Airport in December, anxious to rebuild their lives. Hamo fled to Turkey from Syria after a missile attack killed his wife and one other daughter. He was profiled on the popular photo blog Humans of New York as “The Scientist.”

The White House said Sunday that Hamo will be among about two dozen guests invited to sit near the first lady on Tuesday. The guests include several veterans and service members, including one of the three Americans who thwarted an attack aboard a Paris-bound train.
Those on the guest list will highlight issues that Obama has attempted to prioritize during his tenure, such as expanded health insurance coverage, and issues that he hopes to work on during his final year, such as criminal justice. The guest list includes a California man whose partner was killed in the San Bernardino attack, the first female Army Reserve officer to graduate from the Army’s elite Ranger School and a plaintiff in the landmark Supreme Court case that found same-sex couples have a constitutional right to marry. One seat will be empty, to represent the victims of gun violence.
Obama read about Hamo’s story last month. His cancer had gone untreated because he lacked health insurance. More than $450,000 for the family was raised through an online fundraising campaign actor Ed Norton had set up for them. The White House described Hamo as living the kind of life in Syria that is associated with the American dream. He married his college sweetheart, and they built a life together before a missile tore through the complex he helped design and where his family lived.
Obama told Hamo through a Facebook posting that, “Yes, you can still make a difference in the world, and we’re proud that you’ll pursue your dreams here. Welcome to your new home. You’re part of what makes America great.”

The Al Qadris — Farhan, his wife Muna, and four of their nine children — moved to the United States in June. Their first glimpse of the U.S. was the inside of JFK Airport in New York, before they were shuttled to the farmlands of Lancaster, Pennsylvania, where they now live in a three-bedroom rowhouse in the heart of the city.
They are part of the fallout of a grueling nearly five-year civil war in Syria that has killed more than 200,000 people and forced millions from their homes.
The Al Qadris fled their hometown of Daraa in southwestern Syria with the few clothes they could carry after their house was caught in the crossfire between government and rebel forces.
Sitting on a flower-patterned sofa one afternoon in December, Farhan Al Qadri scrolled through photos on his phone showing the busted windows of his family’s whitewashed home in Syria, lamenting what they left behind that day in August 2012 when they had to cross the border into Jordan.
The family is safe now in Pennsylvania, but face a whole new set of challenges in a foreign land. He shakes his head at a water leak above the window in the kitchen, where his wife is making a huge batch of yogurt and fresh soup with onions and spinach for dinner.

He’s hoping to earn enough at his $10.50 per hour job washing equipment at an egg processing plant to eventually move into a nicer home, something closer to what his family was accustomed to in Syria. There, he owned a grocery store and an olive grove. But they hold no hopes of returning. “In Syria, it’s very bad now, lots of fighting,” he said in halting English.
Many of his friends have gone to Canada, which has promised to take in 25,000 Syrian refugees. “They help with money, a house and clothes. It’s good for Syrians,” he said. “But here now, it’s difficult, I don’t know about the U.S.A.” because of the current backlash.
“Some think Muslims are not good, and some Muslims aren’t good,” points out his teenage daughter, Maha. “But it’s the same with Americans. Some are good and some aren’t good.”
Maha, 18, who is learning how to drive and is a fan of Adele’s song “Hello,” is looking forward to attending college and possibly becoming a doctor. “Here, there is a future,” she said in the small bedroom she shares with her younger sister.
Last fall, President Barack Obama committed to accepting 10,000 Syrian refugees over the next year. But following the November terrorist attacks in Paris, more than two dozen U.S. governors said they wanted to halt the Syrians’ entry until they can review the refugee vetting process. Pennsylvania, not one of those states, has pledged to keep its doors open.
The refugee screening process
The Al Qadris were the first of three families to arrive this year in Lancaster, a city of about 60,000 people.
They underwent two years of security and health screenings. During that time, his 19-year-old son Ahmed turned 21. No longer a dependent, he will have to apply to come to the United States on his own. Four other children are grown and live elsewhere: two sons are in Germany, another in Kuwait and a married daughter lives in the United Arab Emirates.

When families apply for refugee status from the United Nations, they go through a multi-level process to verify their identities, background and the threats they face at home. The United States requires another 13-step process for admission, including security clearances, in-person interviews and FBI fingerprinting.
The Syrian families are high priority because they involve children, said Stephanie Gromek, a community resource coordinator with Church World Service in Lancaster, one of the nonprofits that helps resettle immigrants. Still, the vetting process is long and involved, she said. Each family member undergoes the 13 checks and if any step expires before the process is completed, they must redo that portion.
The approved cases are then brought before nine U.S. resettlement agencies, and they determine which of the 360 U.S. cities that offer resettlement has the capacity to take the families, based on medical needs or other resources the city can provide.
Once the families are accepted somewhere, the International Organization for Migration is notified and coordinates their transportation. The family pays back the travel costs after they are settled and start acquiring income.

Each family is given four months of financial support, after which they are expected to become self-sufficient. The federal government provides about $1,000 per refugee, and the resettlement agencies use the money to help get them started in a home, stocked with household items – usually donated by the community – and offer help with applying for medical assistance and jobs.
Media coverage of the Syrian conflict has raised people’s awareness of the Syrians’ plight but also worries among Americans about their own safety, said Gromek. Church World Service seeks to address those concerns by meeting with various groups to educate them about the extensive vetting process.
It helps to explain even just the basics — that a refugee is a person legally in the U.S. who is eligible to work and start contributing to the community, she said.
Around the holidays, her organization launched a one-day fundraising campaign, which became a litmus test of sorts about the community’s support for the Syrians. The nonprofit hoped to raise $25,000 and ended up doubling its goal.
“It was just reaffirming that Lancaster is welcoming of refugees. They do stand behind what we’re doing,” Gromek said.
That’s partly because the city has a history of immigration, starting with the Amish and Mennonites for which the area is known.

Jon Carlson, pastor of the Forest Hills Mennonite Church in the Leola community of Lancaster County, said about 15 members of his congregation are helping a Syrian family of five school-aged children with household items, transportation to medical appointments, home visits and English language instruction. After seeing the images of the chaos in Syria, “to be able to do something tangible felt really exciting,” he said.
“It’s been so frustrating after the Paris attacks and the San Bernardino attacks to hear a lot of really uninformed rhetoric that we’re unable to vet these people and this is dangerous, when refugees are the most thoroughly screened group that come to this country,” Carlson said.
A sampling of comments on articles published by LancasterOnline shows the range of opinions on the newly arriving Syrians, from “keep them out of this country!” to “closing the doors is a cowardly response.”
“How about we take care of America first, our homeless veterans, starving children and jobless families before we give out free aid?” a commenter asked on the Church World Service’s Facebook page, expressing a commonly held view.
According to Carlson, it’s good to have such conversations when allocating and prioritizing resources. “But this is the largest refugee crisis since World War II and is a humanitarian crisis at an unbelievable scale,” so the U.S. as the world’s richest country has a responsibility to respond, he said.
“If you think more broadly about some of the root causes of extremism and violence, the things that we do as a country, the ways that we’re perceived globally, feed into some of those narratives,” he continued. “So if we’re perceived as being unconcerned about the plight of people living in the Middle East, that feeds into the sorts of narratives that become powerful recruiting tools for those looking to engage in extremism and violence.”
Writer Shawn Smucker, who lives in Lancaster with his wife and five children, believes that getting to know the refugees’ personal stories will help allay people’s fears. He’s written in his blog about a Palestinian refugee, who got in trouble at home for speaking out about women’s rights, and a man whose family arrived from Pakistan and is enjoying its newfound freedoms.
Lancaster accepts a few hundred refugees each year from more than a dozen countries, including Afghanistan, Iraq, Democratic Republic of Congo, Myanmar and Somalia, in addition to Syria.
Gromek said she can’t be sure the controversy over Syrians entering the U.S. is slowing the overseas processing, but her organization had expected to resettle more Syrians by the end of the year than the initial three families.
“I think people are so scared right now of what’s going on in Syria,” said Smucker. “Then, they hear people are coming from Syria and they think they’re going to bring that terror, but that’s just not the case.”
Being a Muslim in Lancaster
About 1,000 Muslims live in the greater Lancaster County region. The Islamic Community Center of Lancaster, which opened in 2013, provides them a place for Friday prayers, Quran studies, movie nights and “mommy and me” groups.
Its members are familiar with the possibility of misunderstanding and fear when it comes to Islam.

Mukaram Syed, an engineer and volunteer member of the center’s Board of Trustees, spends a lot of his time educating others about Islam. The center’s members encourage school groups and others to the tour the site. Particularly after the most recent terrorist attacks, groups have asked the center to make presentations and answer their community’s questions.
“A lot of people don’t know that we believe in one God,” Syed said. “Sometimes, they’re confused about our beliefs.”
The local Muslims haven’t experienced hateful acts that some other cities have, in part because of their involvement in the community, said Syed. The center participates in backpack drives — supplying low-income children with school supplies, coat and blanket collections for refugees and charity runs.
Just in case, the center has security cameras and locked entrances. If there is any vandalism or violence, Syed said he believes outsiders would do it, not their neighbors.
“You have to be part of the fabric. The issues of Lancaster are my issues,” he said. “The work we are doing, we didn’t just start now when something bad happens in Paris. We’ve been doing this from day one.”
The center’s members also are in close contact with the resettled Syrian families.
Farhan Al Qadri happened to call Syed while a reporter was visiting the Islamic Center. He was seeking help transferring money to his son in Jordan. Despite living off food stamps, the father was still thinking of his son, who faces even more hardships, at least for now."

Aya Abdullah, an Iraqi interpreter, became a refugee at the age of 14. After her family received threats, they moved from their home in Iraq to Syria. Now, they live in Turkey after leaving Syria to escape the war.
Abdullah’s story spread across social media after she worked with Brandon Stanton, the photographer for the popular “Humans of New York” blog, as he documented the stories of refugees in Turkey and Jordan. She recently joined the NewsHour’s Hari Sreenivasan for a Skype conversation.
Without citizenship, her family’s options are limited, she said. She cannot get a degree or find another job. And as more and more refugees arrive daily in Turkey, prejudice against them has increased, she said. “We’ve had to switch apartments four times because our landlord decided that Arabic people are no longer allowed,” she told Stanton.
Abdullah described about her family’s process of applying for resettlement through the UNHCR to Sreenivasan. The process is lengthy and involves multiple interviews and months of waiting. Abdullah’s family did two interviews with UNHCR, then two with ICMC, over the course of four and a half years.
In September, the family received word that their application had been accepted — but a follow-up letter in December said that their application had been denied due to “security reasons.”
“We’re not dangerous. We just escaped from war to go to a safer place,” Abdullah told Sreenivasan. “We’re not going to do something bad in your country. This is what I want to say: not every Muslim is a bad person. Because there [are] bad people in our religion, and there [are] bad people in America or the Christian religion. It’s about being a good person.”
A petition to bring her to the U.S. has garnered more than 800,000 signatures so far.

This time, a new piece portraying Apple founder Steve Jobs as a refugee adorns a wall in a migrant camp in Calais, France.
The “Jungle,” as the refugee camp in Calais has come to be known is an improvised camp where hundreds of migrants have set up tents in hopes they can cross the English Channel and into the U.K.
Banksy’s design shows Jobs in his well-known attire of jeans and a black turtleneck, carrying an original Mac computer in one hand and cloth sack slung over his shoulder. On his website, Banksy captioned his new work: “the son of a migrant from Syria.”
Steve Jobs was adopted, but his biological father, Abdul Fattah Jandali, was born and raised in Homs, Syria, a city that has been devastated in the war.
The Dubai-based news site Al Arabiya reports that Jandali, born in 1931, moved to Lebanon when he turned 18 to study at the American University of Beirut. In 1954, Jandali moved to the U.S. because of political unrest in Lebanon. After the terrorist attacks in Paris last month, people on Twitter began sharing the fact that Jobs’ father was a migrant from Syria.

It is unclear whether Jandali would be characterized as a refugee or migrant under current United Nations standards. The UN Refugee agency defines a refugee as a person fleeing armed conflict or persecution. Migrants “choose to move not because of a direct threat of persecution or death, but mainly to improve their lives by finding work, or in some cases for education, family reunion, or other reasons.”
This isn’t the first time Banksy has put his mark on the “Jungle.” Banksy previously installed in the camp a sign that read “Dismal aid,” a twist on the “Dismaland” exhibition he mounted in Somerset, England, this year."

“Today, we welcome many Syrian refugees who were forced to flee their homeland because of war and conflict. Canada is doing the right thing by providing refuge for those so desperately seeking safety. This is a significant step in fulfilling our plan to bring 25,000 Syrian refugees to Canada in the coming months,” Trudeau said in a statement.
Among the refugees who arrived last night were Kevork Jamkossian, his wife Georgina Zires, and Madeleine, their 16-month-old daughter. The Toronto Star reported that Jamkossian expressed his gratitude to the Canadian leader.
“We really would like to thank you for all this hospitality and the warm welcome and all the staff–we felt ourselves at home and we felt ourselves highly respected,” Jamkossian said.
Canada has promised to accept 10,000 Syrian refugees by the end of the year, and 25,000 by March. Trudeau said last month that he is “very much committed to keeping Canadians safe” while continuing to bring Syrian refugees into the country.

Syrian artist Diala Brisly lives in Beirut, where thousands of refugees have arrived this year after escaping war in Syria, and wants to help them return.
Brisly left her home in Damascus in 2013 and moved to Turkey for a year and a half, later landing in Beirut. In the summer of 2014, she met a woman who was founding a school for refugees in Arsal, Lebanon, a small town near the Syrian border whose student population swelled in 2013 with the arrival of hundreds of new children from Syria.
Brisly had previously painted a mural for a children’s hospital in Damascus and she thought a similar project could help lift students’ spirits, encouraging them to return back to school.
“Sometimes they have schools, [but] they are just tents … I thought, if [I] put some colors and some murals, it will be nice and will encourage them to go back to school again,” she said.

With more than 1.4 million Syrian refugees now living in Lebanon — many of them unable to work and reliant on humanitarian organizations for resources — negative stereotypes about Syrians have spread in Lebanon, even as many people open their homes to them. Brisly said she has heard Syrians described as “uneducated” in Lebanon.
But school can be a welcome and positive escape for the children, she said. “Even kids, when you talk to them now, they feel like going to school is kind of [a] luxury,” she said. “Because now they have a very, very hard life.”

Educating young Syrians who are living in diaspora is vital for the country’s future, Brisly said. “It’s really hard to have a full generation out of school. They will be the future,” she said.
Some of the children in the camps help with the painting — a collaborative process that Brisly said grows from developing trust. When she first arrives to paint, “They look at me as any adult. They feel that there is a gap between me and them,” she said. But while they are painting, and afterward when the mural is complete, she said she sees a difference in the way they look at their relationship with school.
“I see them helping, that … help[s] them to feel more belonging to this school,” she said. “They feel that someone really cares about them.”
Brisly has painted 10 murals so far and plans to paint her next one at a refugee camp in the Bekaa Valley this month.

An initial end-stage offer from top Republicans was flatly rejected by Democrats whose votes will be needed to carry the $1.1 trillion measure through the House.
Lawmakers hope to pass the measure in little more than a week to avert a government shutdown, though it’s becoming more and more apparent that a short-term funding bill will be needed to keep the government open past a Dec. 11 deadline.
Republicans aides characterized Tuesday night’s offer from House Speaker Paul Ryan and top Senate Republican Mitch McConnell as an opening move.
Many lower-tier items in the massive measure have been worked out, leaving numerous policy provisions, known as “riders” as the main unresolved items.
The initial offer included provisions to block new Obama administration rules on power plant emissions, weaken the 2010 overhaul of financial regulations known as the Dodd-Frank law, and a contentious House-passed bill requiring greater scrutiny on Syrians seeking refuge in the U.S.
“They sent us an offer that was anti-worker, anti-labor, anti-education, anti-environment … anti-refugee,” said top House Appropriations Committee Democrat Nita Lowey of New York. Many provisions in the 12 spending bills drafted by House and Senate Republicans have been slapped with White House veto threats.
Neither Democrats nor Republicans would release the proposal, but a memorandum from House Democratic staff characterized it in broad strokes, citing “poison pill” riders on the environment, labor regulations, financial regulation and refugees — but not efforts to unravel President Barack Obama’s signature health care law, which is being targeted in legislation currently being debated by the Senate.
Republicans aides characterized Tuesday night’s offer from House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., and top Senate Republican Mitch McConnell of Kentucky as an opening move. Democrats said they would prepare a counter-offer.
The ill-will followed a story in Politico that quoted anonymous Republicans characterizing Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., as an obstacle to the talks and blaming her for slow progress on dozens of unresolved issues.
“We haven’t been talking to the press, we’ve been respectful, we’ve been open, understanding that we have to compromise and the rest — and then all of a sudden, they announce, ‘We’re telling the Democrats time is running out,'” Pelosi told her colleagues Wednesday morning. “Everything that we thought would have movement or that was still an open question, they just negated.”
Despite Wednesday’s blow-up, both sides remain committed to working out an agreement. The measure follows an October pact that awarded both the Pentagon and domestic Cabinet agencies about $33 billion above tight budget “caps” that many Republicans and virtually every Democrat opposed.
“We patiently await their offer,” said McConnell spokesman Don Stewart."

“Refugees are victims, not perpetrators, of terrorism,” the 19 retired military, security experts and others wrote in a letter sent to all lawmakers. “Categorically refusing to take them only feeds the narrative of ISIS that there is a war between Islam and the West, that Muslims are not welcome in the United States and Europe, and that the ISIS caliphate is their true home.”
ISIS is one of the acronyms for Islamic State militants.
Among those signing the letter are former secretaries of state Henry Kissinger, George Shultz and Madeleine Albright. Retired Gen. David Petraeus also signed the letter, as did former Homeland Secretary Michael Chertoff and onetime Defense Secretaries Leon Panetta and Chuck Hagel.
Last month, the House voted overwhelmingly to erect high hurdles for Syrian and Iraqi refugees to come to the United States in the aftermath of the terror attacks in Paris. The bill would require new FBI background checks and individual sign-offs from three high-ranking U.S. officials before any refugee could come to the U.S. from Iraq or Syria, where the Islamic State group that has claimed credit for the attacks has flourished.
The administration, which has announced plans to accept about 10,000 Syrian refugees in addition to the 2,500 who have settled here since 2011, says it already takes around 18-24 months on average for them to make it into this country. They must pass a battery of screening requirements including interviews overseas, fingerprinting and biometric investigations. Many are women and children and only about 2 percent are single men of combat age.
Republicans have called for a pause in the system, a reflection of their constituents’ anxiety. Forty-seven House Democrats broke with President Barack Obama and backed the legislation.
The bipartisan group of former officials said they opposed the legislation, arguing that the vetting of refugees is robust and thorough.
“Given the stringent measures in place, we are especially concerned by proposals that would derail or further delay the resettlement of Iraqis who risked their lives to work with the U.S. military and other U.S. organizations,” the letter said.
The legislation is pending in the Senate, where Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said Tuesday that the issue will be part of the must-pass spending bill that Congress needs to complete later this month to keep the government open."

In the ad released Tuesday, GOP Sen. Mark Kirk of Illinois harshly criticizes Democratic Rep. Tammy Duckworth for voicing support for allowing as many as 200,000 Syrian refugees into the U.S. in the wake of the Paris terror attacks.
“ISIS disguised as Syrian refugees attack Paris. Next target? The U.S.,” the ad says.
“Mark Kirk opposes more Syrian refugees until it can be done safely. For your family’s safety: Who do you trust?”
The Kirk campaign said about $180,000 is being spent to air the ad on TV, a relatively tiny sum. But his focus on the issue highlights the Republican view that it can be a vulnerability for Democrats, especially those like Duckworth who opposed recent GOP legislation cracking down on the refugee program.

The ad’s claims are exaggerated. The Paris perpetrators were mostly French and Belgian nationals, although there was a Syrian passport found near one of their bodies. Authorities have suggested the passport was an Islamic State plant to sow fear of refugees.
Duckworth, a military veteran, has been outspoken about the need to show compassion to refugees, many of whom are women and young children themselves victimized by the Islamic State.
Her spokesman, Matt McGrath, said Kirk’s ad “appeals exclusively to fear and the lowest common denominator. He should be ashamed.”"

The Better Shelter project is constructing refugee shelters in Germany, Switzerland and Sweden and delivered more than 500 units in September to refugee camps in Greece, where thousands of Syrian refugees have arrived in recent months.
The project came from a partnership between Swedish industrial designer Johan Karlsson and the Ikea Foundation, Ikea’s humanitarian wing, in 2010. The project aims to construct higher-quality alternatives to canvas tents, which can be easily damaged by wind or flooding, according to The Globe and Mail.
Better Shelter housing takes four to eight hours to assemble by hand and costs $1,150 each. In April, The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees ordered 10,000 of the tents, and the project has delivered more than 4,700 shelters this year, including 2,600 to Iraq and Kurdistan, according to its website.

“This is just a tiny part of humanitarian aid, but it’s an important one when it comes to allowing displaced people to live with dignity,” Karlsson told The Globe and Mail.
The shelters come in two sizes: 57 square feet, or 188 square feet, and stand 6 feet tall, allowing families to stand up inside. They are constructed of a steel frame and polymer panels. Solar panels located on the roof can power LED lights or a phone charger inside the shelter.
They also feature mosquito nets, windows and a door that locks, which is notable for refugees at a heightened risk for sexual assault.
On Sunday, Ikea also began the “Brighter Lives for Refugees” fundraising campaign for refugees. The initiative it will donate Є1 to the UNHCR for every lamp and light bulb it sells in stores or online between Nov. 29 and Dec. 19."
https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/carson-syrian-refugees-dont-want-to-come-to-the-u-s,refugee,687,2015-11-29T14:17:49-05:00,Associated Press,Carson: Syrian refugees don’t want to come to the U.S.,"AZRAQ REFUGEE CAMP, Jordan — After touring Syrian refugee camps in Jordan, Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson on Saturday suggested that camps should serve as a long-term solution for millions, while other refugees could be absorbed by Middle Eastern countries.
“I did not detect any great desire for them to come to the United States,” Carson told The Associated Press in a phone interview from Jordan. “You’ve got these refugee camps that aren’t completely full. And all you need is the resources to be able to run them. Why do you need to create something else?”
The retired neurosurgeon toured the Azraq camp in northern Jordan under heavy Jordanian security, with journalists barred. Carson’s campaign also limited access, not providing his itinerary.
After the Azraq visit, Carson said he didn’t learn anything that gives him confidence in authorities’ ability to screen potential terrorists. “What I learned is that you’re going to get a different answer from everybody depending on what their slant is,” he said, reiterating his opposition to allowing any Syrian refugees to come to the United States.
More than 4 million Syrians have fled their homeland since 2011, after a popular uprising erupted against President Bashar Assad and quickly turned into a devastating civil war. Most initially settled in neighboring countries, but they are largely barred from working legally and have to resort to informal, low-paying jobs if they can find employment at all.
Overwhelmed host countries, particularly Lebanon and Jordan, have balked at the idea of longer-term integration of refugees. They have complained that they are carrying an unfair burden while the international community’s support has fallen short.
A $4.5-billion appeal to aid refugees in host countries in 2015 is only about half funded. The cash crunch has created increasingly unbearable conditions for Syrian refugees in Jordan, Lebanon, Iraq and – to a lesser extent – in economically more robust Turkey. In 2015, hundreds of thousands of refugees moved on to Europe in hopes of a better life.
Carson called on the American people – not the U.S. government – to launch a “humanitarian drive” to raise billions of dollars that officials say is needed to improve conditions for refugees settled across several countries in the Middle East.
“All they need is adequate funding. It’s really quite impressive when you go over there and see it,” Carson told the AP, adding that some areas had recreational facilities, schools, electricity and indoor plumbing. “They were a lot happier. They were quite willing to stay there as long as it takes before they can get back home.”
Carson’s visit comes as he tries to strengthen his fluency on international affairs as foreign policy becomes a greater focus in the 2016 presidential contest. Advisers have conceded that his knowledge of global affairs isn’t where it needs to be and have expressed hope that missions like his two-day trip to Jordan will help.
Carson and other Republicans have adopted a harsh tone when discussing President Barack Obama’s plan to welcome 10,000 Syrian refugees to the U.S. in this budget year. Debate over Syrians fleeing their war-torn country erupted after a series of attacks in Paris earlier this month raised security concerns across the West.
Carson and his GOP rivals expressed concern that extremists may sneak into the U.S. among them. Last week, he likened blocking potential terrorists posing as Syrian refugees to handling “mad dogs.”
He also suggested that it would be best for Middle Eastern host countries to absorb most of the millions of Syrian refugees that have fled their civil war-torn homeland.
In a separate statement, he described Syrians as “as very hard working, determined people, which should only enhance the overall economic health of the neighboring Arab countries that accept and integrate them into the general population.”
And he broadened his call for financial support beyond Americans: “The humanitarian crisis presented by the fleeing Syrian refugees can be addressed if the nations of the world with resources would provide financial and material support to the aforementioned countries, as well as encouragement.”

Carson toured the Azraq camp in northern Jordan under heavy Jordanian security, with journalists barred. Carson’s campaign also limited access, not providing his itinerary and releasing only a short statement after the camp visit.
The candidate has repeatedly struggled to discuss international affairs as they become a greater focus in the 2016 presidential contest. Advisers have conceded that his foreign policy fluency isn’t where it needs to be and have expressed hope missions like his two-day trip to Jordan will help change that.
Carson and other Republicans have adopted a harsh tone when discussing President Barack Obama’s plan to welcome 10,000 Syrian refugees to the U.S. in this budget year. Debate over Syrians fleeing their war-torn country erupted after a series of attacks in Paris earlier this month that raised security concerns across the West.
Carson and his GOP rivals expressed concern that extremists may sneak into the U.S. among them. Last week, Carson likened blocking potential terrorists posing as Syrian refugees to handling “mad dogs.”
After the Azraq visit, Carson suggested that it would be best to absorb Syrian refugees in Middle Eastern host countries, which have given temporary shelter to most of the more than 4 million Syrians who have fled civil war in their country since 2011.
“Syrians have a reputation as very hard working, determined people, which should only enhance the overall economic health of the neighboring Arab countries that accept and integrate them into the general population,” he was quoted as saying.
“The humanitarian crisis presented by the fleeing Syrian refugees can be addressed if the nations of the world with resources would provide financial and material support to the aforementioned countries as well as encouragement,” the statement said.
“There is much beauty in Syria and I suspect that many displaced Syrians will return there when peace is restored,” he added.
Overwhelmed host countries, particularly Lebanon and Jordan, have balked at the idea of longer-term integration of refugees. They have complained that they are carrying an unfair burden while the international community’s support has fallen short.
An aid appeal of $4.5 billion for refugees in host countries in 2015 is only about half funded. The cash crunch has created increasingly unbearable conditions for Syrian refugees in Jordan, Lebanon, Iraq and – to a lesser extent – in economically more robust Turkey. In 2015, hundreds of thousands of refugees moved on to Europe in hopes of a better life."

In his weekly radio address broadcast Thursday, Obama noted his commitment to accept an additional 10,000 Syrian refugees this year and argued that the policy is in keeping with U.S. tradition.
“Nearly four centuries after the Mayflower set sail, the world is still full of pilgrims,” he said, “men and women who want nothing more than the chance for a safer, better future for themselves and their families. What makes America America is that we offer that chance.”
He said he has been “touched by the generosity of Americans who’ve written me letters and emails in recent weeks, offering to open their homes to refugees fleeing the brutality of ISIL (Islamic State group).”
Obama’s plan to receive thousands of additional Syrian refugees has come under heavy criticism in Congress and has become a key part of the 2016 presidential campaign rhetoric in the wake of a series of attacks Nov. 13 on Paris. Some on Capitol Hill, voicing concerns about homeland security, are pressing for legislation further tightening the conditions under which refugees can be admitted.
“Now, people should remember that no refugee can enter our borders until they undergo the highest security checks of anyone traveling to the United States,” Obama said. “That was the case before Paris, and it’s the case now. And what happened in Paris hasn’t stopped Americans from opening their arms anyway.”
“We turn Lady Liberty’s light to the world, and widen our circle of concern to say that all God’s children are worthy of our compassion and care,” the president said. “That’s part of what makes this the greatest country on Earth.”"

Working to put a human face on the refugee crisis, he said, “They’re just like our kids.”
The refugees Obama encountered at a school for poor children in Malaysia were not from Syria, and unlike the flood of Syrians meeting steep resistance in the U.S., these migrants had already been cleared to resettle in America. Still, Obama said their faces could have been those of kids from Syria, Iraq and other war-torn regions whose pursuit of a life free from violence led them far from their native homes.
“They were indistinguishable from any child in America,” Obama said. “The notion that somehow we would be fearful of them – that our politics would somehow lead us to turn our sights away from their plight – is not representative of the best of who we are.”
More than mere musings, Obama’s comments were intended as a direct rebuke to those demanding a halt to Syrian and Iraqi refugees entering the U.S. in the light of the Islamic State’s attacks in Paris. Obama said the U.S. had shown it can welcome refugees while ensuring security. “There’s no contradiction,” he said.
Many Americans seem to disagree. Democrats in large numbers have abandoned their president and his opposition to stiffer screening measures; forty-seven of them voted against Obama on Thursday. Having secured a veto-proof majority in the House, supporters are now hoping for a repeat in the Senate, while Obama works to shift the conversation to milder visa waiver changes that wouldn’t affect Syrian refugees.
In a modest classroom where refugee children were learning English, Obama zigzagged among art projects, puzzles and a caged class rabbit as he asked children in crisp white uniforms and neckties about their aspirations for the future. Later, as he met with older refugees who will soon relocate to the U.S., he said these children “deserve love and protection and stability and an education.”
“You will see the degree to which they represent the opposite of terror, the opposite of the type of despicable violence we saw in Mali and Paris,” the president said.
He singled out one refugee from Myanmar – a petite 16-year-old in a bright yellow dress – and said she had been a victim of human trafficking until the U.N. intervened. Obama said the girl now hopes to advocate for those who have suffered a similar plight. The White House declined to name the girl out of concern for the safety of her parents still in Myanmar.
“This is who we want to help,” Obama said. “This is the face of people around the world who still look to the United States as a beacon of hope.”
Of the some 150,000 refugees in Malaysia, many if not most are Rohingya, a Muslim ethnic group. Tens of thousands of Rohingya have fled persecution by Myanmar’s Buddhist majority and landed in Malaysia, where Obama was attending a regional economic summit.
Obama’s administration has played a central role in Myanmar’s emergence from brutal military rule, a transformation Obama considers a key foreign policy success. Yet the continued persecution of Rohingya remains a stain on the country’s record, and even opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi, an Obama ally whose party triumphed in recent elections, has been sharply criticized for looking the other way.
Driving the debate about accepting Syrian refugees in the U.S., as in Europe, are concerns that terrorists could exploit the system to enter the country and carry out more attacks. It’s unclear whether that was a factor in the Paris attacks that killed 130, although Obama has insisted that’s not a legitimate security threat. Unlike in Europe, refugees don’t set foot in the U.S. until they undergo a vetting process that typically takes 18 to 24 months.
Since Paris, the refugee issue has reverberated on the 2016 presidential campaign trail, where fears about Muslims in the U.S. have been voiced with a level of openness not seen since 9/11. Obama has accused Republicans of politically driven fear-mongering, but strong support in Congress for tighter vetting measures has underscored how pervasive some of those concerns have become.
“It is wrong to condemn a strong screening process using the language of charity and morality,” said House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif.
Obama also met in Kuala Lumpur with representatives of civil society groups, where he called for tolerance and universal freedoms while avoiding direct criticism of Malaysia’s government. He also attended a summit with Southeast Asian leaders, where he called for reaching an “ambitious and durable” climate agreement in Paris in the coming weeks and praised efforts to create a “code of conduct” to address maritime disputes in the South China Sea.
Before departing for Washington on Sunday, Obama planned to meet separately with the leaders of Laos and Singapore."

Obama’s tour of the Dignity for Children Foundation on Saturday comes amid a raging debate back home over Obama’s plan to allow thousands of Syrian refugees to resettle in the U.S. The foundation provides schooling and assistance to refugees who have fled to Kuala Lumpur, and Obama’s aides said he intended his visit to illustrate how an escalating global refugee crisis only increases prospects for violence that could reach America’s shores.
“We can’t say to other countries, ‘You need to take in refugees, you need to take your fair share, but we’re going to slam the door,'” said Obama’s deputy national security adviser, Ben Rhodes, predicting other nations would follow suit. “Suddenly you have masses of displaced peoples who are essentially in limbo. That clearly is a recipe for greater instability.”
Pervasive concerns that Islamic extremists could slip into the United States and commit attacks like those in Paris have led many U.S. lawmakers to insist Obama’s refugee program be halted or, at a minimum, that entry requirements be tightened. Obama has refused to entertain either idea.
The president has insisted he’ll veto a bill in Congress raising the bar for entry for Syrian refugees. The measure passed the House by an overwhelming, veto-proof margin that included scores of Democrats.
Obama sought to change the subject Friday by throwing his support behind budding efforts to reform the visa waiver process, but those proposals seemed highly unlikely to satisfy critics who want the refugee program halted. Obama wants to take in roughly 10,000 Syrians in the next year.
Many of the refugees living in Malaysia are Rohingya, a Muslim ethnic group. Tens of thousands of Rohingya have fled Myanmar to escape persecution by the country’s Buddhist majority.
Obama’s administration has played a central role in Myanmar’s emergence from brutal military rule, a transformation Obama considers a key foreign policy success. Yet the continued persecution of Rohingya remains a stain on the country’s record, and even opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi, an Obama ally whose party triumphed in recent elections, has been sharply criticized for looking the other way.
The refugee debate has played out this week as Obama traveled to Turkey, the Philippines and Malaysia, but it will confront him directly when he returns to Washington early Monday. One of his first orders of business will be a meeting with French President Francois Hollande, who is vowing war against the Islamic Stage group as nations across Europe clamp down on border controls out of fear that terrorists could strike again."

The vote was 289-137, enough to override a threatened White House veto of the legislation, which was hurriedly drafted in response to the carnage in the streets of Paris. Forty-seven Democrats voted for the bill, despite President Barack Obama’s biting criticism of its proposed limits.
READ MORE: How does the refugee vetting process work?
The bill would require new FBI background checks and individual sign-offs from three high-ranking U.S. officials before any refugee could come to the U.S. from Iraq or Syria, where the Islamic State group that has claimed credit for the attacks has flourished.
Republicans said it was simply prudent to place new controls on the refugee system, without ending it entirely or requiring religious tests as some in the GOP, including presidential candidates, have demanded.
“This is an urgent matter and that is why we’re dealing with this urgently,” declared new House Speaker Paul Ryan of Wisconsin. “It just is common sense that we pause, re-evaluate and make sure that we have the proper standards in place to make sure something like what happened in Paris doesn’t happen here.”
The strong vote in the House could improve prospects for the bill in the Senate. John Cornyn of Texas, the No. 2 Senate Republican, said he would like to see the chamber take up the House legislation as-is, but that is uncertain.
Senate Democrats are trying to shift the focus to other issues regarding travelers from overseas, and Minority Leader Harry Reid predicted Thursday’s bill would not be approved.
“Don’t worry, it won’t get passed. OK? So, next question,” he said.
Traveling in Asia this week, Obama mocked Congress and Republicans for yielding to “hysteria” and taking aim at “widows and orphans.” The White House threatened a presidential veto, contending the legislation would bring to an end an already highly regulated refugee program while doing nothing to enhance national security. And some Democrats complained that the measure would mar America’s image as a welcoming haven for immigrants.
“We might as well take down the Statue of Liberty,” Rep. Jerry Nadler of New York asserted in debate on the House floor.
Yet some Democrats chafed at the White House position. Dozens joined Republicans in supporting the legislation, some fretting openly of being put in the politically untenable position of opposing what they considered a reasonable anti-terror bill in the wake of a horrendous tragedy.
Freshman Rep. Brad Ashford, D-Neb., who faces a tough re-election fight next year, called the Paris attacks “a game changer” and supported the bill, saying, “I cannot sit back and ignore the concerns of my constituents and the American public.”

The White House dispatched Chief of Staff Denis McDonough and Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson to Capitol Hill to meet with Democrats, but several lawmakers said their arguments were unconvincing.
Sean Patrick Maloney of New York got in a forceful exchange with Johnson inside the private meeting, telling him Democrats could lose seats over the vote, according to aides in attendance. Maloney ended up voting with Republicans in support of the legislation.
The administration, which has announced plans to accept about 10,000 Syrian refugees in addition to the 2,500 who have settled here since 2011, says it already takes around 18-24 months on average for them to make it into this country. They must pass a battery of screening requirements including interviews overseas, fingerprinting and biometric investigations. Many are women and children and only about 2 percent are single men of combat age.
The House bill would increase the FBI’s role by charging it with conducting a “thorough background investigation” on each refugee. The Homeland Security secretary would subsequently have to certify, with the concurrence of the FBI director and the director of national intelligence, that the refugee posed no security concerns. Under the current system the Homeland Security secretary has the final say, though multiple other agencies are involved.
On his way out of the meeting with Democrats Thursday, Johnson said the House measure was “a bad bill because it seeks to micromanage the process in a way that is counterproductive to national security, to our humanitarian obligations and to the overall ability of us to focus on homeland security.”
Defenders of the bill, including some Democrats, described the changes as fairly modest, especially in light of rhetoric coming from some Republican presidential contenders such as Donald Trump suggesting keeping out all refugees. Still, advocacy groups warned refugees could be left to languish while the new changes are put into place, and the Catholic bishops and others announced their opposition.
Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton said the U.S. should welcome refugees from the region and bolster America’s defenses and intelligence operations.

Caldwell, Associated Press",How does the refugee vetting process work?,"WASHINGTON — Hundreds of thousands of Syrians have fled that country to escape the ongoing civil war there. Migrants have trekked across Turkey, landing first in Greece, before making their way into Europe. European authorities have been overwhelmed by the mass migration. Meanwhile, the United States has announced plans to accept about 10,000 Syrian refugees trying to leave the region.
READ MORE: U.S. to welcome 10,000 more Syrians. How are they picked?
Lawmakers and more than half of U.S. governors, mostly Republicans, have raised questions about the vetting process for Syrian refugees being brought to the United States. Some said they were worried that Islamic extremists may try to take advantage of the U.S. refugee process.
Here are a few things to know:
— The U.S. annually accepts 70,000 refugees from around the world. This group includes people fleeing violence, religious persecution and war. The Obama administration announced earlier this year that the number of people invited to move to the U.S. as refugees would be increased to 85,000 in the coming year, including about 10,000 Syrians.
— The U.S. has helped resettle about 2,500 Syrian refugees since the war started in that country in 2011. The Obama administration said about half that group is children, while about 2.5 percent are people over the age of 60 and roughly 2 percent are single men of combat age. The overall group is almost evenly split among men and women.
READ MORE: Which states are saying no to resettlement of Syrian refugees?
— Amid questions about background checks and security vetting, the administration for the first time this week disclosed new details about how refugees are investigated. The process is directed by the Homeland Security Department and involves the State Department and U.S. intelligence and law enforcement agencies. Refugees submit to in-person interviews overseas, where they provide biographical details about themselves, including their families, friendships, social or political activities, employment, phone numbers, email accounts and more. They also provide biometric information about themselves, including fingerprints. Syrians are subject to additional, classified controls, according to administration officials, who briefed reporters this week on condition that they not be identified by name to publicly discuss confidential details about the process. The Associated Press had been seeking details about the vetting process since September.
— Administration officials have acknowledged that checking the accuracy or authenticity of documents provided by refugee applicants against foreign government records can be especially difficult involving countries that don’t cooperate with the U.S. government, such as Syria. It can also complicate U.S. efforts to check foreign government records for local arrests or lesser bureaucratic interactions, such as bank records, business licenses or civil filings. “We do the best we can with the information we have,” one U.S. official said.
— As for concerns about potential refugees lacking documents to prove who they are, the administration officials said Syrians as a population tend to provide extensive documents involving their day-to-day lives. They often arrive with family histories, military records and other information that can be useful for American authorities investigating them.
— Refugees who spent years waiting for approval to come to the United States said authorities asked detailed questions repeatedly in multiple interviews, including pressing them about their backgrounds and reasons for fleeing Syria. Nedal Al-Hayk, who was resettled in suburban Detroit with his family after a three-year wait, said officials interviewed him and his wife in separate rooms, asking repeatedly and in different ways where they were born, where their parents were born, what they did before and during the war or whether they were armed, part of a rebel group, supportive of the government or even politically outspoken.
— Syrians initially file refugee claims with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, which then refers them to the U.S. government. The process has no guarantee of approval and takes so long — Syrians wait nearly three years for approval to come to the U.S. — that experts said it would be a longshot for an extremist group to rely on the refugee program as a way to sneak someone into the United States. The Islamic State group has had far more success appealing to people already living inside the United States to commit or conspire to commit violence. Attorney General Loretta Lynch told lawmakers this week that roughly 70 people have been charged with crimes related to foreign-fighter activity and homegrown violent extremism since 2013.
— House Republicans are proposing changes to the refugee vetting process that would include more background checks from the FBI. The proposed legislation, which could be voted on as early as Thursday, would halt refugee processing while the new protocol is established. The bill would require that the heads of the FBI, Homeland Security Department and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence certify that each refugee being admitted would not pose a threat. It could have the practical effect of keeping refugees out of the United States entirely.
The White House on Wednesday threated to veto any legislation to toughen the screening process for Syrian refugees.

Ryan said that under the House bill, Syrian and Iraqi refugees could only be admitted to the U.S. if intelligence and law enforcement officials can certify that they won’t be a security threat.

Here is NewsHour’s look at the candidates’ takes and their possible presidential approaches.
Declare war. Move against the Islamic State with our allies. Allow U.S. entry for Christian refugees, scrutinize others.
Bush spoke on Meet the Press Sunday morning, criticizing both President Obama and two of his GOP rivals. ““This is viewed as a law enforcement exercise by the Obama administration,” he said. “We should declare war.” When asked by moderator Chuck Todd if he would trust frontrunners Ben Carson or Donald Trump as commander in chief, he replied, “I don’t know. The words that I hear them speaking give me some concern.” Monday on CBS This Morning, Bush said that the U.S. should work to help Christian refugees but increase scrutiny for others.
Block Middle Eastern refugees from entering the U.S.
The Republican frontrunner told a group of party activists Friday that the U.S. should at least temporarily block entry for Middle East refugees. Carson told FOX News Sunday, “We should use our expertise and resources to help get them resettled over there, and to support them over there, but to bring them here under these circumstances is a suspension of intellect.”
New Jersey officials on alert. The U.S. must increase action against the Islamic State.
Hours after the attacks, the Garden State governor wrote that he was working with federal and state agencies to ensure security in his state. The following day at the Sunshine Summit in Orlando, Florida, Christie criticized the Obama administration saying, President Obama “likes to see (the world), as a fantasy. I see the world as it really is, and it’s time to have a president who sees the world as it really is, not how he wishes it would be.”
Block Muslim refugees from Syria. Allow some Christian refugees to enter U.S.
In a Saturday rally at the conservative Christian Bob Jones University in South Carolina, Cruz told voters that Muslims from Syria should not be allowed into the United States now, but that the White House should allow entry to in Christians fleeing persecution. On Sunday, the Texas senator pushed back against Democrats, in particular Hillary Clinton, who avoided using the phrase “radical Islam.”

Provide more weapons, training to allies fighting the Islamic State.
In a video posted to her Twitter account, Fiorina said that as president she would provide Middle Eastern allies with more weapons and training to fight the Islamic State. Speaking at the Sunshine Summit in Florida on Saturday, Fiorina blamed President Obama and his administration’s foreign policy decisions for the Paris terrorist attacks.
Step up action against the Islamic State.
Gilmore released a statement on Friday evening, criticizing President Obama and pushing for a more hawkish policy. “This enemy does not respect or fear weakness, and we have given them more than enough of that these last seven 7 years,” the former Virginia governor wrote. “This will only end when we exact justice on this enemy. And by justice, I mean kill them. They will not wait to kill us.“
France should invoke NATO charter, call allies to go to war. The U.S. should send ground troops to fight the Islamic State.
Speaking on CNN Sunday, the South Carolina senator told CNN that France should invoke Article 5 of the NATO treaty, which requires members of NATO to come to one another’s defense. Graham warned another “9/11 is coming,” and the U.S. must send troops to the Middle East to combat the Islamic State.
Block all U.S. entry from Syria and other nations where the Islamic State exists. Increase military action against the Islamic State.
The day after the attacks, Mike Huckabee tweeted that he would partially shut U.S. borders, closing them to anyone arriving from nations where the Islamic State operates.

Invoke NATO Treaty Article 5 and go to war against the Islamic State to defend France.
In a campaign statement, Kasich wrote that the U.S. should invoke Article 5 of the NATO Treaty, which requires nations to come to one another’s defense, and step up military action against the Islamic State. He wrote that he would summon European, Turkish and Sunni Arab allies to work with the U.S. to try and defeat IS.
Block Syrian refugees. Move against the Islamic State with our allies.
In a statement released on his website the night of the Paris attacks, Pataki wrote, “ISIS, al Qaeda and their branches are recruiting, planning and plotting to kill us here – we must kill them there. We must put an immediate halt to granting asylum to Syrian refugees.”
Temporarily block refugees from Islamic State-controlled territory. Impose 30-day wait for approval for most travelers to the U.S.
The Kentucky senator has introduced a bill to block visa insurance, thereby temporarily blocking most entry, for countries with a high risk of terrorism. The plan would also impose a 30-day waiting period for all entries unless the person has been approved through the Department of Homeland Security’s Global Entry program. At the Sunshine Summit in Florida on Saturday, Paul criticized opponent Marco Rubio (below) for opposing similar legislation in the past. In an interview with Fox News Saturday, Paul said he continues to believe the national debt is still the most significant threat to national security.
Block Syrian refugees. Invoke Article 5, the mutual defense clause.
Rubio opposes allowing more refugees from Syria into the United States now. In a statement released on his website, the Florida senator wrote that it is impossible to determine which refugees may have violent motives. He wrote, “There is no background check system in the world that allows us to find that out, because who do you call in Syria to background check them?” In a video released Saturday, Rubio said the Islamic State is fighting with Western civilization and Western values. On Sunday, Rubio told ABC’s “This Week” that the U.S. should invoke NATO Treaty Article 5 and form a coalition for war.
Send 10,000 troops to fight the Islamic State. Block Syrian refugees from entry.
Santorum has long called for sending some 10,000 American troops to the region to help battle the Islamic State. He stressed his hawkish view on Twitter the day after the attacks.

Santorum wants to limit all legal immigration to the United States and told Breitbart News on Monday that Syrian refugees should be barred from entering and that he is suspicious of the proportion of men arriving as refugees.
Block Syrian refugees from entry. Target terrorist banks and oil resources.
In a Monday phone interview with CNBC, Trump said that the U.S. must block Syrian refugees from entering the country. The real estate CEO believes that coalition forces should target terrorist banking abilities and oil resources, which they use to generate funding. In a speech in Texas on Saturday, Trump said that increased gun ownership would have helped prevent deaths during the Paris attacks.
Allow 65,000 Syrian refugees into the country after thorough screening. Islamic State cannot be contained; it must be defeated.
At the Democratic debate on Saturday, the former secretary of state said she continues to support allowing 65,000 Syrian refugees into the United States, as long as they go through a careful screening process. On how to fight the Islamic State, Clinton said the terrorist group “cannot be contained” and must be “defeated.” That was in contrast to a statement by President Obama one day before the attack, concluding that the terrorist group had been “contained.” At the debate, Clinton said the attacks were committed by a “barbaric, ruthless, violent, jihadist terrorist group.”
Allow 65,000 Syrian refugees into the country after thorough screening. Move against the Islamic State with allies. Step up assessment of threats.
At the debate Saturday, O’Malley stood by his past support of allowing 65,000 Syrian refugees into the country once they’ve been screened thoroughly. In an interview with MSNBC, when asked if he thought President Obama underestimated the Islamic State, O’Malley stated, “I believe…we have not yet developed a farseeing national security strategy that identifies threats before they arise to a position that they become military problems for us.”
Do not ban Syrian refugees. Move against Islamic State with a coalition, potentially including Russia and Iran.
In a speech on Monday in Cleveland, Sanders stressed his opposition to any ban on Syrian refugees coming to the United States and accused those calling for such bans of fomenting “Islamaphobia.” He told a crowd Sunday in Indianola, Iowa, that he is open to working with Iran and Russia to fight the Islamic State. One day earlier, at the Democratic debate, Sanders argued that climate change aids the Islamic State and al-Qaida in their recruiting by cutting resources and opportunity. The Vermont senator said climate change remains the most significant threat to national security."

Lynch told the House Judiciary Committee that protecting the U.S. from the threat of the Islamic State and other terrorist groups is the Justice Department’s top priority, adding that more than 70 people have been charged in the last two years for alleged conduct related to foreign-fighter activity and homegrown violent extremism.
Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., asked Lynch about the risk of terrorists posing as refugees. The body of one suicide bomber in Paris was found with a Syrian passport, and prosecutors say his fingerprints match those of someone who passed through Greece in October.
Lynch said the screening process for those considered for immigration to the United States is more stringent, relying on extensive interviews, biometric screening and the combined intelligence assets of several federal agencies.
“Certainly, there are challenges to that process because of the situation in Syria,” Lynch said. “But I would note, however, that we do have the benefit of having that significant and robust screening process in place, a process that Europe has not been able to set up, which renders them more vulnerable.”
The U.S. has admitted only about 2,500 Syrians since the civil war erupted in that country in the spring of 2011, a tiny fraction of the millions who have sought refuge in neighboring countries and Europe.
The Obama administration has set the goal of admitting 10,000 more in the coming year, a decision announced after a photograph of a dead little Syrian boy who had washed up on a Turkish beach in September sparked worldwide calls for compassion.
In the wake of Friday’s attacks in Paris, more than two dozen governors, most of them Republicans, have called for Syrian refugees to be barred from their U.S. states. GOP congressional leaders have also called for a “pause” in the numbers of Syrians admitted to the county."

By Monday afternoon, the number of American state governors, many of them Republican, who released statements refusing to accept refugees ballooned to more than a dozen. The voices of opposition included presidential candidates Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and Jeb Bush, who told “CBS This Morning” that the U.S. screening process should only grant refugee status to Syrian Christians.
In his letter to President Barack Obama, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, a Republican, said his state would refrain from participating “in any program that will result in Syrian refugees — any one of whom could be connected to terrorism — being resettled in Texas.”
Governors of Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, North Carolina, New Hampshire, Ohio, Wisconsin, among others have all issued similar statements, promising to block Syrian refugees from entering their states.
Problem is, states don’t really have a choice.
PODCAST: The worst humanitarian crisis since World War II
According to Think Progress’ Ian Millhiser, the states are limited in their power to resist the intake of refugees, an action that’s specifically under the president’s purview.
Under the Refugee Act of 1980, “President Obama has explicit statutory authorization to accept foreign refugees into the United States.”

In a letter to Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), Rick Scott said “it is our understanding that the state does not have the authority to prevent the federal government from funding the relocation of these Syrian refugees to Florida even without state support.”
Instead, Scott said Congress ought “to take immediate and aggressive action to prevent President Obama and his administration from using any federal tax dollars to fund the relocation of up to 425 Syrian refugees” to Florida.
Cecillia Wang of the American Civil Liberties Union said in a statement Monday that politicians were fabricating a link between the Paris attacks and Syrian refugee resettlement in the U.S.
PODCAST: What it’s like to walk with the refugees and migrants
“Making policy based on this fear mongering is wrong for two reasons,” she said. “It is factually wrong for blaming refugees for the very terror they are fleeing, and it is legally wrong because it violates our laws and the values on which our country was founded.”
Presidential candidate Rand Paul also introduced a bill Monday that imposed an “immediate moratorium on visas for refugees.”
The U.S. plans to accept 10,000 Syrian refugees over the next fiscal year. Some Democrats, including presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Martin O’Malley said that number should increase to 65,000 Syrian refugees. Either way, state governors will have to yield to Obama’s plan.
According to The New York Times, the U.S. has accepted 1,854 Syrian refugees as of Sept. 2015. Over the same time period, Germany has accepted nearly 93,000 refugees.
Speaking from Antalya, Turkey, on Monday, President Obama said the U.S. and other countries should continue to accept refugees leaving Syria, adding that they were the ones that are more harmed by terrorism, especially the brutal tactics of the Islamic State militants.

“Slamming the door in their faces would be a betrayal of our values,” Obama said at the close of the Group of 20 summit in Antalya. “Our nations can welcome refugees who are desperately seeking safety and ensure our own security. We can and must do both.”
Washington Gov. Jay Inslee supported Obama’s stance on providing sanctuary to Syrian refugees.
“Washington will continue to be a state that welcomes those seeking refuge from persecution, regardless of where they come from or the religion they practice,” he said."

ANTALYA, Turkey — President Barack Obama says it’s wrong to equate attacks like those that happened in Paris with Islam. But he says the Muslim community needs to do more to make sure young people are “not infected” with the beliefs of extremists.
Obama says there has not been enough pushback by Muslim leaders against extremism.
He says the United States has to do its part to accept refugees from Iraq and Syria, and that it was “shameful” for political leaders to call for imposing a religious test on refugees.
Obama says the people fleeing Syria are the ones that are more harmed by terrorism. He spoke Monday at a news conference in Antalya, Turkey.

The doctor’s efforts were in vain.
The cries of the bereaved pierced the night.
Lesbos is full of volunteers here to help the migrants. Today, one of the deadliest days, they swaddled young survivors in thermal blankets, trying to ward off hyperthermia.
Adult survivors were visibly traumatized.
The island’s small ambulance service was swamped, and under equipped to deal with such a disaster.
In the darkness, amid the chaos, Greek doctors, and foreign colleagues from international aid agencies did what they could in the triage area on the flagstones.
These people were running away from war and conflict, and they took a wooden boat, because they thought it was safer than the inflatable craft used during the summer. The people traffickers doubled their prices for a place on boats like this.
“We could see the vessel through the binoculars but within a matter of seconds we lost sight of it,” said eye witness Iannis Costakis. “All we could see were life jackets on the surface. So we immediately called the coastguard and Frontex. And even two Turkish boats came and they filled up with people and went back to Turkey. There were at least 150 life jackets visible. It was a big boat, and there must be an awful lot of victims.”
Hours later, a coastguard cutter headed back out to sea to resume the forlorn task of searching for survivors. The sea was flat calm. The afternoon winds that capsize the boat had died down.
A fishing boat that had joined the operation headed for the dock and was surrounded by medics.
The crew had pulled at least one survivor from the water.
Local fishermen and volunteers attached a line to the decrepit pleasure cruiser.
They had to make sure the refugees didn’t panic and capsize the vessel. Fisherman Panayotis Koutsos’ priority was to help rescue the dozens of children on board.
“Can’t the United Nations do something? People are going to get drowned for nothing,” he said. “I’m in the water day and night, and I just can’t watch these children drowning any more. We’re all trying to help here. We’re not bad people on this island, Lesbos. We’re all trying to do what we can and do our duty. It’s a question of humanity. But the powers that be have got take a serious look at this issue and solve it.”

At the summit, 11 EU and Balkan leaders met seeking solutions to the current situation, which has been described as the continent’s greatest immigration crisis since World War II. Nearly 250,000 refugees have passed through the Balkans since mid-September, according to the Associated Press.
“Extraordinary times demand extraordinary measures,” German Chancellor Angela Merkel said.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees António Guterres called on the European Union to devise a new system to register and screen migrants when they first arrive.
Croatian prime minister Zoran Milanović said Greece needed to assert more control of the water between its islands and Turkey, which has been one of the main entry points for migrants. (Nearly 11,500 migrants crossed into the country Saturday, the highest in a single day since Hungary put up a fence and refugees started coming into Croatia in mid-September.)
Slovenian Prime Minister Miro Cerar said Slovenia was also overwhelmed by refugees, with 60,000 arriving in the last 10 days alone. He said the country wasn’t receiving enough help from its EU partners.
Cerar said a continued failure to act would signal “the beginning of the end of the European Union and Europe as such.”"

“People are feeling like they’re running out of options to be able to make a life in the bordering countries,” where resources are overstretched and aid organizations are experiencing funding shortfalls, said Holly Frew, emergency communications officer with CARE USA. Frew visited several refugee encampments in Turkey and Jordan in August.
“Most everyone we talked to said they would like to go back to Syria,” she said. But absent that option, those who can scrape together enough money to pay for transportation risk crossing the Mediterranean Sea to enter Greece and then try to go on to Germany where they hope they will be welcome.
Nearly 400,000 migrants have made the treacherous boat ride to Greece since Jan. 1, according to the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees. Most came from Syria (70 percent), Afghanistan (18 percent) and Iraq (4 percent).
About 1 million of the Syrian refugees who have sought safety in neighboring countries are children, and their lives are upended. “The children who had never missed a day of school are having to work instead so that [their families] can survive and have food on the table,” said Frew.
Sometimes families are separated along the way. Frew met an English teacher and her husband, an electrician, who were finally reunited after spending three months apart at different refugee camps. He had stayed behind in Syria to defend their home and was injured when it was barrel-bombed. She faced her own harrowing trek with their son, calling it the “journey of death.”

I’m haunted by today’s images of child refugees,"I was born in Baghdad. My family was well off and we lived in a nice large home with a beautiful yard. We lived there with my three aunts, grandparents and cousins. The house was so large it fit us all. We even had a small house built in the garden for my aunt and her husband. Then one day I remember being told that I can’t go to school anymore, because we were at war.
I heard about an entire foster home being bombed. They showed it on the news. There were so many children whose lives were lost, souls who had no one to remember them. Were they even real to anyone? Did they exist at all? I remember sobbing as I heard this news. I was 6 years old.
Endless BBC radio news anchor voices still haunt me to this day. We lost our electricity. My family was glued to the radio to hear what was happening: where will they aim at next? How many will be dead? Electricity often goes out at night, to put fear in the heart of the people.
I remember sleeping and hearing bombs and rockets being shot far away, waking up at night and telling my mom I am afraid. She said, don’t worry, they’re not close by, they won’t come near us. She was wrong.
My friend Yassir’s house was bombed. It fell right into their backyard. Baghdad was now officially a target. How can we stay here? Where do we go? My grandpa needed to sort this out, and so we moved into my aunt’s house in our yard. It was new and had a strong foundation. We decided to stay there for the next few days until we figured out where to shelter. People were fleeing, neighbors left. Everything was quiet. Only the sound of air raid sirens and distant rockets, brought us back to our nightmarish reality.

We fled. My mom woke us up that morning at 5 a.m. to travel to the city of Najaf. This was apparently the safest city for now. We had distant relatives there and we stayed at their house. It was winter by then. You see, when you’re young, your concept of time gets distorted. I am not sure how long we stayed in Najaf. But I do remember the horrible conditions we lived in. There was no water or gas, so the heat was scarce in the winter. My grandpa would lug gallons of water with the help of my uncle and bring it to us so we can bathe and use it for food and drinking.
The war tore apart homes, minds and hearts. It took away dreams and realities, and happiness became an afterthought. Iraqis were physically broken, and mentally shaken. The Gulf war shook us to the core, it shook my entire family to the core. We fled, one by one. Until the only people left in our very large house, with a beautiful yard was myself, mom, sister and grandpa.
The Gulf war ended, and after a year we decided to flee Iraq. Iraq was undergoing sanctions, no food or goods could be transported in and out, nor people for that matter. We snuck away one evening, and headed to Jordan. War was over, but the desert between Iraq and Jordan was full of danger. I still remember the navy blue sky with sparkling stars. I looked at them and wondered, how can I feel so scared with those stars above me? And yet I did.
After the Gulf war, there were so many refugees fleeing to Jordan, so there was a lot of discrimination and mistreatment of Iraqi citizens there. Though now it’s totally different as those refugees 20 years ago have built their homes and are raising their families there. My sister and I were not allowed to go to school because we were Iraqi. So we missed out on an entire year of school. We stayed in Jordan for a year, waiting for our sponsorship and paperwork to finish in Canada. My aunt sponsored us to come to Toronto and start a new life.
They say once you’ve settled, and you’re living a good life, you should move on. But can one really move on from such tragic heartbreak? Can one ever move on from displacement, senseless violence, air raid sirens?
When I see images of children refugees now, I feel haunted by them. What haunts me is that these children will grow up and they will be adults who carry on the memories of their reality turned into nightmares. I sob every time I look at them, because even though my nightmare is over, theirs is just beginning. I am heartbroken that they’re suffering and don’t have a home. I am heartbroken that once they reach their new home, if they make it, they might not be welcomed there. And that terrifies me, because feeling like you don’t belong is one of the worst feelings that a human can endure."

The comments come as Carson has taken an increasingly aggressive stance toward Muslims, and a day after national GOP poll leader Donald Trump pledged he would support deporting Syrian Muslims.
“To bring into this country groups infiltrated with Jihadists makes no sense,” Carson told about 150 people at the Des Moines Rotary Club’s monthly morning breakfast meeting. “Why would you do something like that?”
Instead, Carson recommended that the U.S. help settle Syrian refugees in the Middle East, in places such as Turkey. In Carson’s view, the U.S. could assist financially, but not open its doors.
Germany’s top security official said Friday that authorities so far had found no cases of terrorists with instructions to carry out attacks in the country mixing into the flow of incoming migrants.
Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere said authorities had received tips from intelligence services that this could happen, but so far such concerns haven’t been confirmed.
Carson later told reporters that, despite the German official’s comments, terrorists “would be fools not to” try to enter the United States with Syrian refugees.
“At some point you have to use common sense and judgment,” Carlson said before headlining a town hall meeting at a community college north of Des Moines. “If you are part of the global Jihadist movement, and you see large numbers of people from your area moving into the United States, wouldn’t you want to infiltrate them?”
Carson’s comments echo Trump, who Thursday said, “If I win, they’re going back,” referring to Muslim Syrian refugees.
However, Carson has taken an increasingly skeptical view of Muslims in his public comments in recent days, as his political fortunes have improved. Carson now finds himself atop national Republican preference polls with Trump, and reported raising an impressive $20 million for his campaign in the third quarter of the year.
Carson has also launched a petition challenging the tax exempt status of the largest Muslim advocacy group, part of an escalating rift with the U.S. Muslim community.
The Council on American-Islamic Relations last month called for Carson to quit the presidential race after he said a Muslim should not serve as president. He has since clarified his position, stating he wouldn’t support a radical Muslim who did not support the Constitution. And in a Thursday radio interview, Carson said the same standard should apply to a Supreme Court justice.
Carson has repeatedly warned that officials needed to carefully screen for potential terrorist ties Syrian refugees seeking to enter the United States, but went further Friday.
Despite anxiousness among some Republicans about the appearance of intolerance in a party trying to reach more minority voters, Carson’s team has said publicly it works to his advantage in segments of the GOP electorate, especially in Iowa."

Fast food giant, McDonalds, has spearheaded a “multimillion-dollar” media initiative for the U.N.’s World Food Program.
These funds, they say, will help pay for television airtime supporting WFP’s response to the crisis, which recently featured the animated ad, “Stop Hunger. Start Peace.” Burger King, DreamWorks, Facebook and Twitter, among others, have also backed the initiative in solidarity.
“We felt it was an opportunity for us to contribute something meaningful, something authentic,” McDonalds CEO Steve Easterbrook said to the New York Times. “This is not about single brands. This is about doing good.”
Apple will be making its own “substantial” contribution to the Save the Children charity and match donations from its’ employees two-for-one.
They also released a new version of Crowded House’s 1999 song, “Help is Coming,” on iTunes with proceeds going to Save the Children.
“Apple is dedicated to advancing human rights around the world,” Apple CEO Tim Cook wrote in a statement. “We hope the actions we’re taking will help make the situation less desperate for some, and ease the hardship so many are enduring.”
Google has also pledged $1 million to relief efforts and challenged individuals to raise $5.5 million by matching their donations.
The donations will be sent to four different non-profits: Save the Children, Doctors Without Borders, the UNHCR and the International Rescue Committee.
“These nonprofits are helping deliver essential assistance, including shelter, food and water and medical care, and looking after the security and rights of people in need,” Google wrote on its One Today page.
This support has been welcomed by aid agencies, but the crisis has proven exorbitantly expensive, even for the united front of America’s most powerful corporations.
The WFP reaches more than 4 million Syrians and 1.3 million refugees in camps in neighboring countries. But for 2015, the aid agencies requested a whopping $7.4 billion to adequately care for all the refugees. As of September, they received less than 40 percent of that total.
While the U.S. has been the largest funder of the WFP with more than $1.1 billion committed, the private sector only represents 5 to 10 percent of this pool.
The funding shortages led the U.N.’s food program to cut the aid of 360,000 refugees from Syria’s neighboring countries, Lebanon and Jordan, in September leaving most refugees in those countries living on about 50 cents a day.
But the surge in corporate donations has brought new hope to the WFP as a means to bring more support and attention to their appeal.
“This gives us a megaphone,” WFP’s director of private sector partnerships Jay Aldous said to Reuters. “We think the sum total of using the voices of all of these companies is greater than the sum total of a singular financial gift.”"

The U.S. will accept 85,000 refugees from around the world next year, up from 70,000, and that total would rise to 100,000 in 2017, according to U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, who was in Berlin to meet with German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier to discuss the mass migration of Syrians fleeing their civil war.
Many, though not all, of the additional refugees would be Syrian, American officials have said. Others would come from strife-torn areas of Africa. The White House had previously announced it intended to take in 10,000 additional Syrian refugees over the next year.
The migrants would be referred by the U.N. refugee agency, screened by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and resettled around the U.S.
“This step is in keeping with America’s best tradition as a land of second chances and a beacon of hope,” Kerry told reporters after the meeting with his German counterpart. Kerry also met with some refugee families on the wooded, lakeside resort-style campus of the foreign ministry’s education center outside Berlin.
Congressional approval is not required for the expansion of resettlement slots, though Congress would have to appropriate money to pay for the additional effort. Some Republican lawmakers have expressed concerns that Islamic State militants could seek to slip into Europe or the U.S. posing as migrants.
In 2011, two Kentucky residents who had been resettled as Iraqi refugees were accused of being al-Qaida members. They were convicted of terrorism charges after their fingerprints were linked to roadside bombs in Iraq. That led to a cumbersome reinvestigation process and new steps to screen refugees, a process that has been criticized as slow and bureaucratic.
Even if the U.S. took in 30,000 Syrians over the next two years – an unlikely outcome, given that only 1,500 have been admitted since the start of the war – that number would pale in comparison to the hundreds of thousands that Germany is expected to accept, or the 800,000 Vietnamese that the U.S. resettled in the years after the Vietnam war.
A letter made public last week and signed by several former Obama administration officials urged the U.S. government to accept 100,000 Syrian migrants, and to put in place special rules to speed the resettlement process.
In Washington, Democratic presidential candidate and former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton said in a television interview that the U.S. “has to do more and I would like to see us move from what is a good start with 10,000 to 65,000 and begin immediately to put into place the mechanisms for vetting the people we would take in, looking to really emphasis some of those who are most vulnerable.”
Conditions in Syria have been growing increasingly dire as the civil war grinds on, and as many as 9 million people have been displaced, including more than 4 million who have fled the country, according to the United Nations.
“Current efforts are not adequate,” according to the letter, signed by Michelle Flournoy, a former senior U.S. defense official who once was Obama’s choice for Pentagon chief, and Harold Koh, the former State Department legal adviser. “Humanitarian aid has fallen short in the face of unspeakable suffering.”
A U.S. acceptance of 100,000 Syrians, the letter said, “would send a powerful signal to governments in Europe and the Middle East about their obligation to do more.”
Kerry did not address why the U.S. proposal is well short of what the former officials advocated, but in London on Saturday, he said the migrant crisis must be solved by ending Syria’s civil war and replacing President Bashar Assad.
Kerry on made clear Saturday the U.S. was willing to negotiate the terms of Assad’s exit with Russia, which is backing his government with a recent military buildup. The Russians brought in fighter jets and surface to air missiles that could threaten American plans, much to the dismay of American officials.
Critics have accused the Obama administration of passivity in the face of Russian aggression.
After holding out hope Saturday that Russia could help the U.S. fight the Islamic State, Kerry took a somewhat tougher line on Sunday, saying that he and the German foreign minister agreed that “support for the (Syrian) regime by Russia, or by any other country, risks exacerbating the conflict and only hinders future cooperation toward a successful transition.”"

The surge of migrants and refugees risking their lives to enter Europe has brought renewed focus on the issue and raises many questions:
What is the best way to deal with the millions of people who have been displaced globally by conflict? Who deserves protection – refugees, economic migrants or both? Who is responsible for Syrian refugees – neighboring nations, Europe, the United States? What is the right balance between humanitarian action and security?
On Thursday, we held a chat to discuss these issues and more with Former U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright (@madeleine), former British Foreign Secretary and current International Rescue Committee CEO David Miliband (@DMiliband), PBS NewsHour Correspondent William Brangham (@wmbrangham) who is back from assignment in Hungary and Austria, and “The Globalist” Editor-in-Chief Stephan Richter (@theglobalist).

“It’s like the West now is crying for the refugees with one eye and aiming at them with a machinegun with the second one, because actually those refugees left Syria because of the terrorism, mainly because of the terrorists and because of the killing, and second because of the results of terrorism,” he said.
“When you have terrorism, and you have the destruction of infrastructure, you won’t have the basic needs of living, so many people leave because of the terrorism and because they want to earn their living somewhere in this world.”
Assad said that dialogue toward a political solution — called for by the international community — needs to continue while his government continues to fight terrorism.
“Let’s say we sit together as Syrian political parties or powers and achieve a consensus regarding something in politics, in economy, in education, in health in everything. How can we implement it if the priority of every single Syrian citizen is to be secure? So, we can achieve consensus, but we cannot implement unless we defeat the terrorism in Syria,” he said.
“As you know, we are at war with terrorism, and this terrorism is supported by foreign powers,” he continued. He called on political forces “whether inside or outside the government” to unite around what Syrians want: “If we ask any Syrian today about what they want, the first thing they would say is: we want security and safety for every person and every family.”
When asked which countries are helping him in the fight against terrorism, Assad said “friendly countries, particularly Russia and Iran.” He also is cooperating with Iraq, which faces the same type of threat, he said.
The U.S.-led coalition is ineffective and has caused the Islamic State group to expand, he added. “The coalition has failed and has no real impact on the ground.”

The Geneva-based International Organization for Migration said Friday that more than 430,000 refugees and migrants have crossed the Mediterranean to Europe so far in 2015, more than double last year’s total.
Many risk traveling in rickety boats and 2,748 have drowned in the attempt, according to the IOM.
In one particular disaster, 34 refugees drown off the coast of the Greek island Lesbos — nearly half of them children — when their wooden boat capsized, Reuters reported.
The U.N. Committee on the Rights of the Child said the “shocking images” of desperate migrants trying to reach safe havens underscores the need for a coordinated approach that protects the children involved. European Union ministers met Monday to try to come up with a standard plan.
Germany, which expects to take in 1 million migrants this year, is tightening border security by conducting random vehicle checks along major roads bordering Austria.
Austria and Slovakia also have reintroduced border checks, while Hungary has erected a razor-wire border fence to try to keep out migrants making their way to other European countries.

The White House has been under heavy pressure to do more than just provide money to help meet the humanitarian crisis in Europe. Tens of thousands of people from war-torn countries in the Middle East and Africa are risking their lives and dying en masse during desperate attempts to seek safe haven on the continent.
The refugees from Syria, however, would be people who are already in the pipeline and waiting to be let into the United States, not the thousands working their way through eastern Europe and landing in Greece. It was not immediately clear how admitting a larger number of Syrian refugees who are in the processing pipeline would help alleviate the crisis that European countries are grappling with.
White House spokesman Josh Earnest said about $4 billion that the administration has provided to relief agencies and others is the most effective way for the U.S. to help shoulder the crisis, but that President Barack Obama has decided that admitting more Syrian refugees in the budget year that begins Oct. 1 would also help boost the U.S. response.
About 17,000 Syrians have been referred over the last few years to the U.S. for resettlement by the U.N. refugee agency. About 1,500 are in the U.S., with another 300 scheduled to be allowed in this month. That leaves about 15,000 Syrians waiting for the clearance process to conclude, according to the State Department.
Obama would like to admit 10,000 of those, according to Earnest’s announcement.
Earnest said earlier this week that the administration has been looking at a “range of approaches” for assisting U.S. allies with 340,000 people freshly arrived from the Middle East, Africa and Asia. Many are fleeing parts of Iraq that are under the Islamic State group’s control. The 1,500 Syrians who are resettling in the U.S. represent a small percentage of the 11.6 million people who have been chased out of the country or uprooted from their homes due to the civil war in Syria.
Secretary of State John Kerry told lawmakers Wednesday that the U.S. will increase its worldwide quota for resettling refugees by 5,000, from 70,000 to 75,000 next year — and the number could still rise, according to two officials and a congressional aide who requested anonymity to discuss a private meeting.
Kerry said after meeting with Senate Judiciary Committee members that the U.S. would increase the number of refugees it is willing to accept. He did not provide a specific number.
“We are looking hard at the number that we can specifically manage with respect to the crisis in Syria and Europe,” he said Wednesday.
Germany is bracing for some 800,000 asylum seekers this year.
Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton, Kerry’s predecessor at the State Department, called for an “emergency global gathering” at the U.N. General Assembly meeting this month, where countries could pledge aid money and to accept some of the migrants.
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said Thursday that the U.S. should increase the number of refugees it resettles next year by more than the 5,000 figure to help European countries, saying the figure suggest by Kerry “is far too low.” Pelosi, D-Calif., said the U.S. accepted far more refugees after the Vietnam War and could do so again.

A fence erected by the Hungarian government is being built to keep refugees and migrants out — a stark contrast to the response of other European nations, which are debating how and whether to let more people in.
Correspondent William Brangham, and producers Saskia de Melker and Jon Gerberg posted these photos on Instagram, from a makeshift camp where hundreds wait in limbo.

Even as these people left, more migrants continued to pour over the border from Serbia, just a few hundred yards away.

Two officials and a congressional aide said that Secretary of State John Kerry told members of Congress in a closed-door meeting on Capitol Hill Wednesday that the United States will boost its worldwide quota for resettling refugees from 70,000 to 75,000 next year, a number that could increase further. A fraction of those would be from Syria.
Kerry said after the meeting that the United States would increase the number of refugees it is willing to take in but did not give a specific number.
“We are looking hard at the number that we can specifically manage with respect to the crisis in Syria and Europe,” he said. “That’s being vetted fully right now.”
The officials and the congressional aide spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the private meeting on the record.
Shortly after Kerry’s meeting, Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona went to the Senate floor to urge stronger leadership from Obama on stemming violence in the Middle East and North Africa. He stood next to an enlarged, close-up photo of the dead body of three-year old Aylan Kurdi, a Syrian boy who drowned along with his 5-year-old brother and mother when their small rubber boat capsized as it headed for Greece.
“This image has haunted the world,” McCain said. “But what should haunt us even more than the horror unfolding before our eyes is the thought that the United States will continue to do nothing meaningful about it.”
White House press secretary Josh Earnest said Tuesday that the Obama administration has been looking at a “range of approaches” for assisting U.S. allies with 340,000 people freshly arrived from the Middle East, Africa and Asia. Many are fleeing parts of Iraq that are under the Islamic State group’s control.
Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton, Kerry’s predecessor, called for an “emergency global gathering” at the United Nations General Assembly meeting later this month, where countries could pledge aid money and to accept some of the migrants. The event would be similar to a gathering convened after the 2010 earthquake in Haiti.
The top three groups of people resettled by the U.S. are Burmese, Iraqis and Somalis. Beyond Syrians, the administration wants to increase the number of Africans coming to the United States next year, according to a senior U.S. official involved in the process.
While Germany braces for some 800,000 asylum seekers this year, the U.S. hadn’t previously said if it would increase its worldwide quota. Throughout Syria’s 4½-year civil war, the U.S. has accepted only about 1,500 Syrians — a tiny percentage of the 11.6 million people who have been chased out of the country or uprooted from their homes.
After the fall of Saigon in 1975, the U.S. accepted more than a million refugees from Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos. In more recent years the U.S. has taken in large numbers of Muslim Kosovar Albanians and refugees from Iraq.
But what those crises involved and Syria’s may lack is a sense of U.S. responsibility. Refugee operations in Southeast Asia followed years of U.S. warfare there, as did the decision to take in tens of thousands of Iraqis over the last decade. Many Americans will feel differently about taking large numbers of Syrians displaced by a war that the United States has tried hard to avoid.
In addition, U.S. intelligence officials say they are concerned that the flow of migrants into Europe has been infiltrated by Islamic State group extremists who are bent on carrying out terror attacks.
“Exactly what’s their background?” Director of National Intelligence James Clapper said Wednesday during an industry conference. “We don’t obviously put it past the likes of ISIL to infiltrate operatives among these refugees.”
Asked directly if the Obama administration felt responsible to share Europe’s refugee burden, Earnest stressed U.S. support thus far: $4 billion in humanitarian aid, more than any other country has provided, and ongoing diplomatic work to resolve Syria’s conflict peacefully. The diplomacy appears nowhere near ending violence that started in 2011 with a government crackdown on political opponents, spawning an armed insurgency and eventually leading to Islamic State extremists seizing much of the country.

“The United States has to be at the table, has to be leading it,” she said Wednesday in Washington. “This is a global responsibility.”
While Germany braces for some 800,000 asylum seekers this year, the U.S. hadn’t previously said if it would increase its worldwide quota for resettling refugees from 70,000. Only a fraction of those would be Syrians, who must first navigate a multiyear application process before learning if they can start a new life in the United States.
The U.S. resettlement process for refugees, as it stands, is slow. They can wait around three years to find out if they can move to the United States, meaning Washington wouldn’t be able to offer Europe much in quick assistance. Throughout Syria’s 4½-year civil war, the U.S. has accepted only about 1,500 Syrians — a tiny percentage of the 11.6 million people who have been chased out of the country or uprooted from their homes.
After the fall of Saigon in 1975, the U.S. accepted more than a million refugees from Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos. In 1999, tens of thousands of mostly Muslim Kosovar Albanians were flown to the U.S., processed at Fort Dix in New Jersey and ultimately resettled. During the Iraq war, more than 50,000 refugees were allowed to come under a special, expedited program for people whose religious beliefs or past work for the U.S. military put their lives at risk.
But what those crises involved and Syria’s may lack is a sense of U.S. responsibility. Refugee operations in Southeast Asia followed years of U.S. warfare there, as did the decision to take in tens of thousands of Iraqis over the last decade.

Security concerns also run high, especially after two Iraqi refugees were arrested in Kentucky four years ago on charges they plotted to help kill American troops in Iraq. U.S. officials appeared to miss several security warnings. Lawmakers and presidential candidates have cited the case in opposing more Syrian refugees in the U.S.

Greece or Italy sell me an island,ill call its independence and host the migrants and provide jobs for them building their new country
— Naguib Sawiris (@NaguibSawiris) September 1, 2015
Naguib Onsi Sawiris, a prominent Telecoms billionaire, said buying an island for refugees was a feasible option in an interview with Agence France Press.
“You have dozens of islands which are deserted and could accommodate hundreds of thousands of refugees,” Sawiris said, according to Forbes.
Forbes estimates that buying an island off Greece or Italy could cost anywhere between $10-$100 million.
The billionaire acknowledged the absurdity of his tweet but insisted he was serious, tweeting “there is nothing to joke about. I don’t joke on the misery of people.”
Just this week, images of a drowned Syrian boy showed the tragic plight of refugees. According to the UN refugee agency, UNHCR, the boy’s death added to the estimated death toll; some 2,500 people have died this summer attempting to cross the Mediterranean to Europe The influx of refugees and migrants to Europe has opened up a larger political debate on how European countries should act.

The movement started on Facebook when author and professor Bryndís Björgvinsdóttir created a page called “Dear Eygló Harðar — Syria is Calling” urging Icelanders to speak out and support Syrian refugees in any way they can.
Björgvinsdóttir writes on the page the purpose is “to show the government that there exists a will to receive even more refugees from Syria than the 50 that have already been discussed. We want to push the government — show them that we can do better, and do so immediately!”
Many are offering to open up their home or give aid, while others are simply showing their support to put pressure on the Icelandic government.
Even people from other countries are chiming in and hoping to help.
One man writes “We live in Prague with our three-year-old daughter. Our flat is too small to accommodate anyone, but we are exploring ways to sponsor a child or a family less fortunate than we are.”
While another posts “I live in France. How can I help?”
Prime Minister of Iceland Sigmundur Davíð Gunnlaugsson told Icelandic station RUV he intends to appoint ministers to address the growing pressure to receive more refugees.
“I think there is a consensus that we should do more to respond to the problem,” Gunnlaugsson told RUV, “we just need to find out how we [can] do it best.”
Welfare Minister Eyglo Hardardottir hasn’t named a maximum figure yet, but told RUV they would explore every avenue available in welcoming more refugees.
Iceland, a country of around 330,000 (the U.S. has around 320 million), is responding to more than 4 million Syrian refugees who have fled their warring country. The United Nations calls the conflict the worst humanitarian crisis for almost a quarter of a century."

In trying to help him, the brothers talked to different refugee agencies and learned that to reunite families there wasn’t any digital system that crossed all agencies. The existing manual system “was very cumbersome and all done by pen and paper,” said David Mikkelsen.
“We wanted to decentralize the process and bring the masses into the fold, so you could have not one person trying to help 600,000 people, but 600,000 people helping 600,000 people,” said his brother Christopher.
In 2008, they created a family-tracing service called Refunite on a mobile platform, because many potential users had regular mobile phones not smartphones.
When refugees register with Refunite, they are asked a set of questions about their missing person, such as their home town, clan, year of birth, and a teacher they had growing up, which Refunite then runs through its database.
The users can get text messages — or call into a toll-free hotline if they don’t know how to read — to get information about possible matches.
The brothers work with Swedish telecom company Ericsson and other mobile network operators in 14 countries across Africa and the Middle East to provide the free matching service.

The nonprofit also teamed up with the Red Cross, U.N. refugee agency and other international aid organizations operating in camps to train local refugees on the technology so they can help with the family searches.
“Educating people in that sense gives them not just the opportunity to reconnect their community members with missing families but it gives them a strong sense of purpose and work to do,” while they’re waiting in the camps to return home, said Christopher Mikkelsen.
The local volunteers “are instrumental in creating trust because they are the ones advocating for our system,” David added.
Kakuma in northwestern Kenya is one such refugee camp where their system is in play. The camp, in existence since 1992, hosts people fleeing violence from countries including Sudan, Somalia and an ever-growing population from South Sudan.

Warring factions in South Sudan have driven an additional 46,000 refugees to Kakuma, bringing the total population of the camp to 185,000, according to the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees.
Kujien Nyak, 29, is one of Refunite’s outreach volunteers from South Sudan. Fifteen years ago, he fled Upper Nile state, where fighting has intensified between forces protecting the local government and the South Sudan Army.
He is still seeking his own family members, and in the meantime is trying to help other Kakuma camp residents find their relatives.
The hardest part is tempering people’s expectations that they will find their missing loved ones right away, Nyak said via email. Sometimes there are instant reconnections, but it also can take months before other family members sign up for the alerts. “It’s very important to keep checking the platform on a regular basis,” he said.

It’s hard to tell how many relatives and friends have found each other under the Mikkelsens’ system, because it’s an anonymous platform and the refugees who do find each other tend not to report back, said Christopher Mikkelsen. But based on matching key words and phone numbers, which they use to validate matches, they have extrapolated that they have helped reconnect about 1,500 families and an additional 100-150 families per month, he said.
Their call center in Nairobi has about 15 agents working 12 hours a day, answering an estimated 40,000 to 60,000 calls per month, he said.
The brothers are continually trying to make the system more understandable, such as tailoring and localizing instructions in places where most people are illiterate. “Whether we’re operating in the Congo, Sudan, Somalia, Kenya, there are challenges everywhere, it’s never easy … and you have to figure out what really works in this region.”
They view themselves as a purely technical organization, putting their tools in the hands of people on the ground. “We don’t want to reinvent the wheel,” just make the wheel better, David Mikkelsen said.

With more than 350,000 people — the population of New Orleans proper — it’s more like a little city.
But it quickly differs from one. The camp was established more than 20 years ago when Somalis fled war in their country. Its population swelled in 2011 due to the drought in East Africa.
The refugees are completely dependent on the Kenyan government and international relief organizations for food, shelter, water and sanitation. It takes 9,300 metric tons of food per month at a cost of $9.6 million to feed them, according to the U.N. World Food Program, which had to reduce rations recently after shortfalls in funding.

Located in eastern Kenya, about 60 miles from the Somali border, the camp is also under threat of being closed. It’s near the town of Garissa, where al-Shabab militants shot and killed dozens of students at a university in April.
This attack and others committed by the Somali-based al-Shabab terrorist group have led to repeated calls for closing the camp, which, according to aid organizations, would be a disaster.

“Abruptly closing the Dadaab camps and forcing refugees back to Somalia would have extreme humanitarian and practical consequences, and would be a breach of Kenya’s international obligations,” U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees spokeswoman Karin de Gruijl told reporters in April.
The government of Kenya should instead strengthen law enforcement at Dadaab and along the border to prevent armed militants from entering, she said.
The issue of security in the region is expected to come up during President Barack Obama’s trip to Kenya for the Global Entrepreneurship Summit on July 25 and 26.
The deteriorating security situation caused Doctors Without Borders to close two clinics in one of the camps and remove 42 of its staff in May. “These were nurses, clinical officers and doctors,” said Charles Gaudry, head of mission in Kenya for Doctors Without Borders. “It has been a big challenge to reorganize the work and to maintain as much as we can the services that we’re able to provide there.”
The remaining medical sites, including a hospital and two clinics, are operated by about 700 members of its local staff and trained refugees, he said. There are no current plans to reopen the two other clinics.

Somalia, Kenya and the U.N. refugee agency signed an agreement in 2013 to help Somali refugees voluntarily move back home. Some refugees say they want to return, but only when Somalia is peaceful and stable, said the International Rescue Committee’s Sharon Waxman in a GlobalPost article.
Others, who were born in the camp, have never been to Somalia and might not want to resettle there, said Gaudry. About 3,000 refugees have volunteered to return home with their travel expenses covered, and the number is slowly increasing even though it’s still a nominal amount, he said.
With the global war on terrorism and the unstable situation in Somalia, he continued, “there’s constant and increasing pressure on the people living in Dadaab — on one side by the Kenyan government that portrays them as a security threat to the country, and by the armed groups from Somalia who are pushing on the refugees on the other side.”
In an effort to speed departures and eventually close the camp, the Kenyan government no longer allows the building of permanent mud-brick structures. Instead, it restricts new structures to wooden frames with iron sheet roofing and plastic sheeting walls to create less of an enticement for people to stay in the camp long-term, Gaudry explained.

“It’s life on standby for many people, including youth,” he said. Children have access to primary education, but only a few can go to secondary school. And job opportunities are available to even fewer. With refugees required to get permits to travel outside of the camp, “it is kind of an open-air prison.”
Secretary of State John Kerry described the limited prospects of the younger generation of refugees last month after speaking with them via video link while he was traveling in Nairobi, Kenya.
“They told me how they dream of attending university and pursuing careers in medicine, politics and human rights. But they also shared their fears that they would end up trapped and jobless, and that all their striving would be in vain. We cannot let that happen,” he said on World Refugee Day on June 18.

The school will serve around 200 Syrian girls living in refugee camps in the Bekaa Valley region along the Lebanese border.

“I am here on behalf of the 28 million children who are kept from the classroom because of armed conflict. Their courage and dedication to continue their schooling in difficult conditions inspires people around the world and it is our duty to stand by them,” Yousafzai said in a statement.

One day after a World Population Day statement from U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon lamenting the plight of refugees, specifically women and girls, Yousafzai sent a similar message:
“On this day, I have a message for the leaders of this country, this region and the world – you are failing the Syrian people, especially Syria’s children.”
As of July 9 there are more than four million Syrians living as refugees, according to the U.N. Refugee Agency.
Yousafzai had previously asked world leaders to give an additional $39 billion each year to secure 12 years of free schooling for children around the world, ahead of an education summit in Norway on July 6."

In 1992, the number of refugees from Afghanistan totaled 4.6 million.
“This (Syria) is the biggest refugee population from a single conflict in a generation,” said U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees Antonio Guterres in a statement. “It is a population that deserves the support of the world but is instead living in dire conditions and sinking deeper into abject poverty.”
Most of the refugees are in Turkey (1.8 million), followed by Lebanon (1.2 million), Jordan (629,000), Iraq (250,000) and Egypt (132,000). (See an overview.)
The number of Syrian refugees from the conflict now in its fifth year reached the 3 million mark less than a year ago.

Who are these refugees? According to the agency, they are split about evenly between males and females. About 25 percent are children. The next largest age bracket is 18-59 year olds. Less than 2 percent are 60 years and older.
In terms of illness and disease, most suffer from respiratory infections. Other communicable diseases include skin infections, diarrhea, urinary tract infections, and ear and eye infections. Preexisting conditions include hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and cancer.
With damaged infrastructure, and shortages of food, fuel and electricity, more than 12 million people in Syria need some form of humanitarian assistance, according to the United Nations. The World Food Program, Syrian Arab Red Crescent and 23 other local organizations are distributing food to 3 million Syrians on a monthly basis. Food rations include rice, pasta, oil, tomato paste, salt and sugar.
In one sign of progress, the WFP recently began distributing food again to Tal Abyad in northern Raqqa governorate in Syria, the self-described capital of the Islamic State group, after forces were able to liberate it from militants.

The UN Refugee Agency released a report on Thursday which said the number of displaced persons across the globe has reached an all-time high of nearly 60 million.

Turkey, Pakistan, and Lebanon are temporary homes to the greatest number of refugees.

“With 86 percent of all refugees living in the developing world, and with the humanitarian response system increasingly overstretched, international solidarity and burden-sharing are crucial in meeting the needs of displaced communities as well as their hosts,” U.N.

About 59.5 million people were displaced worldwide in 2014, compared to 51.2 million in 2013, which at the time was the highest increase in a single year, said the U.N. refugee agency’s “Global Trends” report. More than half of the refugees are children.
The main driver is the fighting between government and opposition forces in Syria. In its fourth year, the war has caused more than 3 million people to flee to neighboring countries and displaced 7.6 million more. The next largest groups of refugees came from Afghanistan (2.6 million people) and Somalia (1.1 million people).
More than a dozen other conflicts have erupted in the past five years in other places, including Iraq, Yemen, Ukraine, Kyrgyzstan, Central African Republic, Libya, northeastern Nigeria, Democratic Republic of Congo, South Sudan and Burundi.
“We are witnessing a paradigm change, an unchecked slide into an era in which the scale of global forced displacement as well as the response required is now clearly dwarfing anything seen before,” said U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees Antonio Guterres. “It is terrifying that on the one hand there is more and more impunity for those starting conflicts, and on the other there is seeming utter inability of the international community to work together to stop wars and build and preserve peace.”
The report showed an increase of refugees in all regions: Europe (up 51 percent), Middle East and North Africa (up 19 percent), sub-Saharan Africa (up 17 percent), Asia (up 31 percent) and the Americas (up 12 percent).

President Barack Obama said Shanna Peeples of Palo Duro High School teaches students from Iraq, Somalia and other places of trauma and violence that have faced challenges that would overwhelm even adults.
“Shanna’s classroom has provided a safe haven,” Obama said. He credited her with driving up the number of Palo Duro students taking advanced placement English and quoted her as saying, “In a sense, I sell hope.”

The president said America is hungry for more teachers like Peeples. “They deserve our support and our appreciation and they also probably deserve higher salaries,” he said to applause from teacher finalists from every state gathered around him in the Rose Garden.
Peeples accepted the crystal apple given to a winner each year and said public school teachers offer students dreams “no matter their abilities, behaviors or financial situation.”
The White House also said Obama plans on Thursday to visit a library in Washington’s impoverished Anacostia neighborhood to announce a new effort to provide books to underprivileged children."

Brazil took in 2,320 refugees in 2014, the bulk of whom came from Syria, the country’s Justice Ministry said Tuesday. In total, Brazil now houses 1,739 Syrians out of about 7,000 refugees from 80 different countries. Angolans are the second largest group in Brazil with 1,071 people granted refugee status.
The Justice Ministry’s refugee agency also said Brazil received more than 8,300 applications last year from Syrians seeking asylum in the South American country, a 29 percent increase from the nearly 6,000 applications it received in 2013.
Although the country is in a different hemisphere, Brazil has a strong connection to the Middle East and Syria, in particular, because of an early 20th century immigration wave that led to three million Brazilians with Syrian ancestry, UNHCR, the UN’s refugee agency, said.
Now in its fifth year, Syria’s civil war has displaced millions, including more than 3.7 million Syrians registered as refugees with the United Nations.
As of December, the U.S. has only accepted 300 Syrians refugees, the Los Angeles Times reported, although Washington officials have promised that the State Department was considering 9,000 applications, expecting “admissions from Syria to surge in 2015 and beyond.”
UNHCR released a report Wednesday calling for more international humanitarian support as large swaths of Syrian refugees slide into abject poverty. Two-thirds of Syrian refugees in Jordan now live below the poverty line, the report said.
U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees Antonio Guterres said, in a statement, the “insufficient” global response would fail to give Syrians living in Jordan and other neighboring countries a “dignified life.”
Guterres also told the NewsHour in November that this “mega-crisis” in Syria “reflects the lack of capacity of the international community to prevent conflicts and to timely solve them.”"
https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/u-s-grant-refugee-status-child-migrants,refugee,435,2014-11-14T11:52:55-05:00,"Pete Yost, Associated Press",U.S. to grant refugee status to some child migrants,"WASHINGTON — The U.S. government will launch a program in December to grant refugee status to some minors under the age of 21 who live in Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador and whose parents legally reside in the United States.
U.S. officials say parents can ask authorities free of charge for refugee status for their children in the Central American countries, which are plagued by poverty and vicious gang violence. The program does not apply to minors who have arrived in the U.S. illegally.
Vice President Joe Biden is set to announce program later Friday at the Inter-American Development Bank, where the presidents of the three Central American countries will present a plan to stem child migration from their countries.
U.S. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity ahead of the program’s formal announcement, said that children deemed refugees will be able to work immediately upon arrival in the U.S., opt for permanent residency the following year and for naturalization five years later. They did not say how long the process of receiving refugee status will take.
An official said the Central American children that meet the requirements will be part of a quota of 4,000 people from Latin America receiving refugee status each fiscal year. The U.S. quota of Latin America refugees currently consists of Cubans and Colombians.
Applicants who don’t meet the requirements will be evaluated to see if they can be admitted conditionally under a non-permanent migratory status that allows them to work temporarily in the U.S.
The program aims to be a legal and safe alternative to the long and dangerous journey some Central American children take north to reach the U.S. and to reunite with their parents here. Tens of thousands of unaccompanied child and teenage migrants showed up at the U.S. border earlier this year.
Biden’s announcement comes as President Barack Obama is poised to act soon to unveil a series of executive actions on immigration that will shield possibly around 5 million immigrants living in the country illegally from deportation, according to advocates in touch with the White House.
Biden was not expected to announce any additional funds to support the Central American initiative, which will focus on the communities of origin of many of the children heading to the United States, officials said. Central American officials have not provided the expected cost of the plan. Officials said U.S. cooperation with Central America currently amounts to $600 million a year.
On Wednesday, Salvadoran Foreign Minister Hugo Martinez said the plan includes measures to stimulate economic growth, improve public safety, improve government agencies and provide better education and training opportunities."

Syrians fleeing the civil war, which began in March 2011, are arriving in other countries exhausted, scared and without any money. Many have had to pay bribes at checkpoints along the borders.
“Refugees crossing the desert into eastern Jordan are being forced to pay smugglers hefty sums (US $100 a head or more) to take them to safety,” the agency said in a statement.
Most refugees are in Lebanon (1.14 million), followed by Turkey (833,000) and Jordan (608,000). About 139,000 are in Egypt and 214,000 are in Iraq. Another 6.5 million Syrians — more than half of which are children — have been uprooted from their homes and now are hunkered down elsewhere in the war-torn country.
According to Oxfam International, only about 5,000 Syrian refugees have been resettled in other nations besides those neighboring Syria, whose resources are being stretched thin.
In April, Guterres told PBS NewsHour that the sheer number of refugees is having broader impacts in the region.
“It’s not only a terrible tragedy for the Syrians. It’s becoming an enormous threat to the stability of the region and a global threat to peace and security,” he said. Watch his full interview below:

https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/official-green-berets-fly-sinjar-iraq,refugee,694,2014-08-13T18:11:03-04:00,"Robert Burns, Associated Press",Obama considering military options for rescuing Iraqi refugees,"EDGARTOWN, Mass. — President Barack Obama is considering a range of military options, including airlifts and creating safe passages, for rescuing thousands of Iraqi refugees trapped on a mountain, the White House said. A small team of U.S. troops secretly scouted the site Wednesday.
A U.S. military-led rescue mission on Sinjar Mountain could involve putting American troops on the ground. But the White House insisted that their mission would be strictly a humanitarian rescue and would not constitute a return to combat 2½ years after the last U.S. troops withdrew from Iraq. Obama is expected to make a decision in days.
“We don’t believe that involves U.S. troops re-entering a combat role in Iraq,” said Ben Rhodes, Obama’s deputy national security adviser. “It involves frankly a very difficult logistical challenge of moving folks who are in danger on that mountain into a safer position.”
The U.S. has been delivering food and water to the refugees for several days. But Rhodes said it was unsustainable to let thousands of people remain on the mountain.
“There needs to be a lasting solution that gets that population to a safe space where they can receive more permanent assistance,” he told reporters traveling with the president during his vacation on the Massachusetts island of Martha’s Vineyard.
The Pentagon sent 129 U.S. troops to Iraq on Tuesday to assess the scope of the humanitarian crisis and the options for getting them safely off the mountain. Rhodes said that given the urgency of the situation, Obama was expected to receive their final recommendations quickly and make a decision within days.
That process was advanced Wednesday when a team of fewer than 20 U.S. troops was flown onto the mountain by Black Hawk helicopter for a firsthand look at rescue mission possibilities, according to a defense official who revealed some details prior to a public announcement of the mission. They were safely extracted hours later.
Also Wednesday, a U.S. drone aircraft attacked and destroyed an armed truck operated by Islamic militants near Sinjar, the U.S. Central Command said.
Thousands of Iraqi religious minorities sought refuge on Sinjar Mountain after militants from the Islamic State group swept through their village in northern Iraq. In addition to the humanitarian aid drops, the U.S. has conducted airstrikes against Islamic State targets, both to protect American personnel in the region and stop the militants from moving on the civilians again.
Obama has ruled out sending combat troops back into Iraq, where nearly 4,500 Americans were killed during the eight year war that ended in 2011.
Rhodes suggested the U.S. would undertake a rescue mission with help from allies, including Kurdish forces that are receiving arms from the U.S. and the British.
British Prime Minister David Cameron confirmed Wednesday that his country stood ready to assist with that effort.
“We need a plan to get these people off that mountain and get them to a place of safety,” he said. “Detailed plans are now being put in place and are underway and that Britain will play a role in delivering them.”
The British military has already joined the U.S. in delivering supplies to the mountain in recent days. Rhodes noted that there have also been offers of humanitarian assistance from France, Canada and Australia.
The White House has not said specifically how many people they believe to be on the mountain, though estimates range in the tens of thousands. Rhodes said several thousand have escaped, but the U.S. is seeking a more firm estimate from the assessment team now on the ground.
The Pentagon said the assessment team was transported to Irbil, capital of the largely autonomous Iraqi Kurdish region, by a small number of V-22 Osprey aircraft from an undisclosed location in the Middle East.
The assessment team joins 90 U.S. military advisers already in Baghdad and 160 in a pair of operations centers — one in Irbil and one in Baghdad, the central government’s capital — working with Iraqi security forces.
They were in addition to about 455 U.S. security forces and 100 military personnel working in the Office of Security Cooperation in the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad.

The plan would involve screening youths in Honduras, one of the world’s most violent nations, to determine whether they qualify for refugee status. Similar in-country screening programs were set up in East Asia after the Vietnam War and in Haiti in the 1990s.
The officials cautioned that no final decision on the matter had been made and said the proposal was among a range of ideas the White House was considering. The officials briefed reporters ahead of President Barack Obama’s meeting Friday with Central American leaders on the condition they not be identified by name.
Since last fall, the U.S. has seen a dramatic increase in the number of migrants from these three countries arriving at the southern border, particularly children traveling without any adult guardian.
Since Oct. 1, more than 16,000 unaccompanied children from Honduras have been caught crossing the Mexican border illegally. At the same time, more than 30,300 Hondurans traveling as families have also been arrested.
The U.S. has resisted calling the situation a refugee crisis, though Obama and top officials have called it a “humanitarian crisis.”
It is unclear what would happen to children and families who have already made the dangerous trek to the United States if the refugee plan is implemented. Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson has repeatedly said that there is no free pass for immigrants who come to the United States illegally and that those who are caught crossing the border would be sent home.
The administration would also have to outline what the refugee proposal would mean for Honduran immigrants already in the United States. In 1999, the U.S. government granted Temporary Protective Status to Hondurans living in the country illegally in the wake of Hurricane Mitch. The status has been renewed several times since then, and according to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services about 60,000 Honduran living in the United States have received the protective status.
Immigrants from El Salvador received the protection in 2001 and USCIS says about 202,000 Salvadorans remain the U.S. under TPS.
Newly arriving immigrants from countries granted TPS are not eligible for the protection from deportation. TPS is used from time to time by the government to stop deportations to specific countries when authorities deem it is unsafe to return immigrants.
The New York Times first reported that the White House was considering the refugee program for young people in Honduras.

Ban has provided housing assistance in countries all over the world, including Haiti, China, India and Turkey. In 1995, he designed cardboard houses and a “Paper Church” community center for victims of the earthquake in Kobe, Japan.
According to the Pritzker Prize, he attributes his desire to use recyclable materials to Japanese culture and his upbringing.
The 56-year-old architect also designed the Pompidou Centre-Metz modern and contemporary art museum in France, the Japan Pavilion at the 2000 Hannover Expo in Germany, as well as other innovative structures for private clients.

In total, 2.2 million Syrians have been internationally displaced by the turmoil gripping their home nation. Half are children. Most left home by crossing Syria’s border by land and now shelter in neighboring Jordan, Lebanon, Iraq and Turkey — nations overwhelmed by their growing refugee populations. Some have traveled further abroad, to North Africa or Eastern Europe. The AFP presents data on refugees across the Middle East in an infographic published today:

NAIROBI, Kenya — One of the four gunmen linked to the Westgate shopping mall siege once lived in a refugee camp in northwestern Kenya, The Associated Press reports.
Two Kenyan security officials told The AP that Mohammed Abdinur Said lived in the Kakuma refugee camp. The camp is run by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, UNHCR, and hosts more than 100,000 refugees, 54,000 of which are Somalis.
The Somali Islamic extremist group Al-Shabab claimed responsibility for the Sept. 21 attack on the mall that lasted over four days. Al-Shabab said the attack was revenge for Kenya’s military campaign in Somalia for the past two years.
Previously, 23-year-old Somalia native Hassan Abdi Dhuhulow was identified as a mall attack suspect. His family moved to Norway in 1999.
Concerned about the security inside the refugee camps within Kenya’s borders, the country’s government, Somalia and UNHCR signed an agreement Sunday that offered support to the 475,000 registered Somali refugees, should they decide to return to their homeland, the AP reports.
Mutea Iringo, the permanent secretary for Kenya’s Interior Ministry, said Sunday that the new agreement to repatriate Somalis was so they could “participate in the development of their country.”

Housing refugees for more than two decades, security has been a concern for the Kenyan government.
“Of course one of the challenges we faced over time was security … the country was experiencing a lot of attacks by the terrorists in the northeast coast and Nairobi,” Iringo said to Kenya’ Citizen TV. “The government decided to intervene in Somalia … and currently we are assured once they are repatriated we will be able to minimize the incidents of insecurity to a large extent.”
As details gradually emerge from the Westgate mall attack, four Somali men appeared in Kenyan Court Monday, facing charges for assisting the attackers, including one charged with harboring a terrorist. All four men pleaded not guilty to all charges lobbied against them, the Los Angeles Times reports."

The 43-year-old teacher is involved in one of the least-known, longest-running conflicts involving refugees, part of a decades-long dispute over a Colorado-sized strip of land in northern Africa called Western Sahara. On one side are the Sahrawi refugees led by a group known as the Polisario Front. On the other, the Moroccan government, which annexed Western Sahara after Spain’s colonial forces withdrew in 1976.
In the decades since, five Sahrawi refugee camps have sprouted up in western Algeria’s barren Tindouf province. With their mud-brick and concrete buildings, and nomadic tents known as khaimas, they look more like towns. Pens hold goats and camels for meat and skins. Water is pumped from the ground.
Deid vividly remembers arriving in the region at age 9, after a harrowing journey across the desert, having fled the violence between Moroccans and Sahrawis in the mid-1970s. She was separated from her mother and sisters when they encountered Moroccan forces. The others were turned back, but she managed to slip away to Algeria with her grandmother.
“I felt like I lost everything,” she said recently through a translator. “My mother was gone. My father was killed in the fighting. Later, my grandmother passed away, and I was all alone.”
But Deid carried on. She studied and became a teacher of primary school and then of secondary school. She married, had four children, and later divorced. She now lives with her three daughters and son in the newest camp, Boujdour. And even after 37 years, she still clings to the hope that she’ll one day return to her homeland.
“That was my strength — to see that future generations do not have to live like me,” she said.
Rabab Deid is one of many Sahrawi women in the camps who took on leadership roles while men were fighting in Western Sahara in the 1970s and 1980s. Since then, the women have retained their independent way of life. Photo by Larisa Epatko
Deid tells her students about the life she remembers as a child. “We had the sea and beaches and many different places,” she tells them, adding, “‘This is not our homeland. You must do whatever it takes to go there.”
During the fighting, both Moroccan and Polisario forces committed abuses, such as torturing opponents and jailing dissenters without trials, according to Human Rights Watch. (Read HRW’s 2008 report on the Polisario camps.)
The armed conflict ended in 1991 with a U.N.-brokered ceasefire. The agreement also directed a referendum in a few months’ time, under which Sahrawis would vote either for independence or to integrate with Morocco, but 22 years later that vote has yet to take place.
As more Moroccans move into Western Sahara, the referendum has stalled over issues such as who would be allowed to vote.
Deid’s resolve to remain in the camps until Western Sahara’s “liberation” is shared by many other refugees. Even though Morocco considers Western Sahara historically part of its own country, it allows locally elected governments, for which Sahrawis can run for seats, and pours money into developing the area’s infrastructure and resources.
Until the Sahrawis in the Algerian refugee camps return to their homeland of Western Sahara, a U.N.-sponsored program flies family members back and forth for temporary visits. Deid has seen her mother twice this way since their separation, in 2001 and 2010. Being with her was overwhelming, she said.
“We felt the same way — as if they had killed a part of us,” she said.
Life in the refugee camps
The Sahrawi refugee camps in Tindouf province, Algeria, were established in the mid-1970s.
The refugee camps, each named after a city in Western Sahara, have schools, hospitals and administrative offices. The Polisario Front runs the camps, serving as their government and security.
The temperature swings as high as 120 degrees Fahrenheit in the summer and drops to freezing during winter nights. It doesn’t rain often, but when it does — mostly in August, the rain falls in torrents for a week straight, causing homes to erode if not reinforced by concrete blocks.
The refugees are dependent on international assistance for food, which is supplied mainly by the World Food Program and distributed by the Sahrawi Red Crescent. Tons of wheat flour, rice, vegetable oil, lentils and sometimes fresh produce, such as onions, tomatoes and bananas from Ecuador, are trucked into the camps and distributed monthly to families.
About 158,000 refugees in the camps receive food assistance, said Buhobeini Yahia, president of the Sahrawi Red Crescent. Some don’t qualify, including the military, police and other workers earning a salary. Most working Sahrawi refugees don’t get salaries, but rather a small monthly stipend from the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees to work in the hospitals and schools.
The main health problems in the camps are malnutrition and the blood disorder anemia, a lack of red blood cells likely caused by a lack of iron-rich foods.

The determination of the refugees to stay in Algeria until Western Sahara becomes independent is one of the ways this cluster of camps is different than other refugee camps — and more challenging, Yahia said. Instead of looking to integrate into the host country, the refugees want to stand their ground. What’s resulted is an isolated desert community at the mercy of international aid.
The camps could use about $130 million per year in aid, but this year received less than $70 million, Yahia said.
“That makes the situation very difficult because we can’t satisfy the needs of the population here,” he said. Absent a humanitarian solution, he added, the refugees need a political one.
But a political solution has been tough to come by so far. Most Sahrawis want full implementation of the U.N. ceasefire agreement, which included the referendum for self-determination that never happened.
Polisario President Mohamed Abdelaziz — who has constitutional power to declare a return to the conflict with Morocco — said the pressure is becoming fierce and “almost unbearable.” But for 40 years, he said, the Polisario has invested in the Sahrawi people, their education and wellness, and until now they have been able to wait and understand that they need to stick together.Younger Sahrawis in particular are getting more and more impatient and are pressuring their elders to return to war with Morocco.
“But until when?” he asks. “I don’t believe it can be an eternity. Patience has its limits.”
New security threats

Meanwhile, the Polisario is now confronted by another growing threat — extremist groups.
In North Africa, militant Islamist groups have carried out a number of attacks, including the siege of the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya on Sept. 11, 2012, and the January 2013 hostage-taking at the gas plant in Tiguentourine, Algeria.
The threat hit even closer to home in October 2011, when suspected Islamist militants abducted two Spaniards and an Italian aid worker in Rabouni, the government center of the Algerian refugee camps. The aid workers were released nine months later in Mali and the suspected kidnappers are in custody.
The kidnapping took the Polisario by surprise and forced it to face a new threat: terrorism, said Brahim Mohamed Mahmud, secretary of state for security. His position was created after the incident to assist the minister of defense.
The Polisario itself is a target of extremist groups, because of its vastly different views of religion and democracy, Polisario President Mohamed Abdelaziz said from his compound in Rabouni. Most of the Sahrawi refugees are Muslim, but they can practice any faith.
The extremists “don’t consider us a Muslim movement,” Abdelaziz told a group of visiting reporters earlier this month. “They will not forgive us for being a democratic movement. They will not forgive us for having equality for men and women.”
Since the kidnapping, Polisario security forces are more visible when foreigners are visiting, and vehicles of armed guards accompany convoys driving between the camps.
The Polisario shares intelligence with Algeria, Mahmud said, adding: “Our dream is to become a state and have security cooperation” with other countries as well.
What’s next?
The region is drawing more attention these days because of the activity of extremist groups, but the Sahrawis themselves get little notice because there’s not much spillover outside of Western Sahara and it’s not an area with abundant natural resources, said Eric Goldstein, deputy director of Human Rights Watch’s Middle Eastern and North African Division.
“The implications for the United States are less important than the implications of Iran, Egypt, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict or the Persian Gulf countries,” he said.
The Sahrawi refugees are doing OK now because of international handouts, said Goldstein. “But if the international community reduced the rations, there would be panic there.”

Significant developments in the Sahrawi situation don’t come about that often. U.N. envoy to Western Sahara Christopher Ross, who is a former U.S. ambassador to Algeria and Syria, continues to meet with the parties separately. A decolonization committee is discussing the case in the United Nations. The U.N. Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara, or MINURSO, has offices in Western Sahara and Tindouf, Algeria, and is helping keep the peace.
Most Polisario officials say they will continue to wait for a diplomatic solution, though they are quick to add that it would be within their right to return to an armed conflict with Morocco to try to bring independence to Western Sahara.
“We’re doing everything we can to make sure a solution is found through peaceful means,” said Abdelaziz, the Polisario president. “But if the United Nations and all the other efforts fail to find a peaceful solution to the conflict, the only other option for us is to go back to the armed struggle, which is our legitimate right. We hope it doesn’t come to that.”
In the meantime, the Sahrawis in the camps keep waiting.

“It seems to be very difficult (to outsiders), but we get used to it,” said Bayn Abdeti, a 38-year-old mother of three. She spends her time taking care of her children and husband, who works as one of the camp’s administrators. “With time, if you do something on a daily basis for years, you get used to it.”

It’s not a battle of guns but of wills, Polisario officials say.
Every four years, a group of 2,000 elected people, including civilians, military members, Sahrawis from the refugee camps and from Western Sahara, and members of the diaspora, meets to vote on the president of the Polisario — and on whether they should return to war with Morocco.
The vote to return to war generally falls along generational lines: Older Sahrawis, who experienced the fighting in the 1970s and 1980s, tend to want to wait for the diplomatic efforts to run their course, while the younger Sahrawis, some of whom were born after the 1991 U.N. ceasefire agreement, are itching to return to war.
Several young Sahrawis living in five Polisario-run refugee towns in western Algeria shared their opinions through translators:
Omar Hassena Ahreyem, 31, director of the youth council at the Boujdour refugee camp:
“We know that no one wishes to go back to war, and we know that life is very precious. But it is like we are already buried alive. I think we have to break this whole cycle. What do we have left to lose? I have a university degree. What about my ambitions?”
Goambara Abdou, 25, a high school teacher in the Smara refugee camp:
“History has shown there are countries that have obtained their independence, like South Sudan. We have hope, and we’re ready to relaunch the armed conflict and draw the attention of the world to our cause.”
Abba Mohamad Lamin, 29, a hospital worker in the Laayoune refugee camp:
“We might be accused of having violent leanings, but that’s not correct. We think that the international community was given more than enough time and we gave them our trust. We blame the Polisario for the failures of the negotiations (with the United Nations in 1991).”
Khadad Emhamed, Polisario diplomat and negotiator to the U.N. mission in Western Sahara, acknowledged the frustration. “As a human being, as a refugee and as a Sahrawi, I accept their comment. I cannot say it is rational or 100 percent right, but I accept their comment.”
Emhamed said it would be difficult to return to war, but that Morocco wasn’t doing much to win over the Sahrawis in the disputed territory of Western Sahara by clamping down on protests and jailing demonstrators for long terms.
“Morocco has been unable to make it accepting to the population in Western Sahara that they are in good hands.”
Tatah Lehbib, 25, a student at the Dakhla refugee camp:
“If the international community and United Nations are serious and genuine about resolving the issue, let’s give it a chance. I wouldn’t mind.”

Both 13, they are into clothes and shoes like many others in their age group. The difference is they live in a refugee camp called Dakhla in western Algeria, and those niceties are hard to come by — along with some basics as well.
“We don’t have enough games,” said Abdlhai. “There’s not enough clothes and shoes. There’s not enough water.”
The two girls were linked arm-in-arm, taking a break at a film festival to talk to a reporter.
Dakhla is the most remote of the half-dozen camps run by the Sahrawi liberation organization known as the Polisario Front. Located in the desert near the Moroccan and Mauritanian borders, the camps are completely dependent on international food aid for survival. The camps came into existence in 1976 after Spain gave up its colonial claim to Western Sahara, and the Sahrawis and Moroccans battled for control of the territory. Morocco maintains control of the area, following a U.N.-brokered ceasefire in 1991, and Algeria lets the refugees stay at the camps.
It’s an unlikely place for an international film festival, but FiSahara is in its 10th year there, amid the sand dunes and camels. Visitors stay with families in their nomad tents and boxy mud-brick homes.

For a week, the atmosphere is carnival-like with clown stilt-walkers blowing bubbles at screaming children and lots of singing and dancing.
Movies, mostly from Spain, are projected onto a four-story-tall wooden screen propped up on a truck. One of the movies shown Friday was timed to the second annual International Day of the Girl Child. “Girl Rising” features nine stories about girls overcoming adversities, such as child labor and Haiti’s earthquake devastation, in order to go to school.
Martha Adams, senior producer of “Girl Rising”, said the movie was being screened on the same day in 2,500 locations, including Washington, D.C.
Across the globe in the Dakhla camp, the prospects for a girl’s education are good. Girls outnumber boys in school, including universities, said the Dakhla Minister of Education Mariam Hmada. Each camp has several primary and secondary schools, and the refugees can travel to other parts of Algeria for a free higher education.
“This is like an oasis of progress in terms of literacy,” said Adams. In the refugee camps, women take many leadership roles as well. “This is a special place to visit simply because of their success.”

Instead of trying to change minds about the value of a girl’s education, the film’s producers were looking to learn more about the refugees’ views of education and their successful implementation despite their hardships.
Eliza Woloson, founder of the Global Education Fund and program director of Women Have Wings, said even more than an education, girls in the camps need role models to help them overcome those hardships.
When we asked the two girls, Abdlhai and Mohamedsalej, who their role models were, they considered the question for awhile.
They had heard of Aminatou Haidar, the longtime advocate of peaceful protests in Western Sahara’s quest for self-determination, who lives many miles away in the territory’s capital Laayoune. But it turned out their role models were closer to home.
Abdlhai said her brother is a teacher, and she would like to become one, too.

In a letter to resettlement agencies, Lawrence Bartlett, the director of refugee admissions for the bureau said that the moratorium on refugee travel was extended to Oct. 21 “because it is unclear whether certain federally-funded services and benefits will be available to arriving refugees.” Normally, the number of refugees admitted during the fiscal year is decided by the first week in October.
Displaced refugees expected to arrive in the U.S. are now stranded in their country of origin. For 47-year-old Santos Landazury, a Cuban refugee, the shutdown stalled the reunion with his wife and son in St. Louis.
“The situation makes us feel like the government has let us down,” Landazury told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. “This is a government in which I put my trust.”"

The camps in Algeria’s Tindouf province have been around since 1976 when Spain gave up its colonial claim on Western Sahara and the Moroccans and Sahrawis battled for control. Those wanting to escape the violence fled to the camps. The Polisario Front, which is in charge of the independence movement, governs them.
The group will be visiting Oct. 7-13 when the most isolated of the four camps, Dakhla, hosts an international film festival, called FiSahara. In its 10th year, the festival is meant to draw attention to the Sahrawis’ cause and bring a cultural experience to those living in such a remote place.

The camp is home to more than 120,000 Syrian refugees. Frame grab from video shot by freelance journalist Ted Nieters on assignment for PBS NewsHour
ZAATARI REFUGEE CAMP, Jordan — As the United States and Russia continue to push their plan of a conference aimed at bringing representatives from the Syrian government and the opposition together to discuss a political solution to Syria’s bloody civil war, many Syrian refugees claim they have no hope that this conference or other conferences will yield results.
“There have been too many conferences but there is no actual settlement or solution,” said 25-year-old Nadia Raja who arrived at Zaatari refugee camp a few weeks ago from Daraa, Syria, with her husband and five children.
Others, who have been at the camp for several months, were much more angry in their response, claiming that Russia had no interest in easing Syrian President Bashar al-Assad from power and that other countries weren’t doing enough.
Zaatari resident Um Hassan cursed Russia when she was asked about the Geneva conference. “(Damn) all the countries that stand with Bashar. If they didn’t side with Bashar, he will fall tomorrow.”
“Are all these countries of the world not capable of standing up and saying a word of truth against Bashar?” asked Hassan’s neighbor at the camp Um Shadi as they stood outside their tents with their children. “All these people that are dying, all this blood that is flowing, isn’t it valuable enough to interfere?”

One-hundred-twenty-thousand victims of the Syrian conflict are packed into U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees tents or “caravan” trailer units at the Zaatari refugee camp in Northern Jordan.
Located just a few miles from the Syrian border, residents and camp workers said they can often hear the fighting between Assad’s forces and the Free Syrian Army in the evening.
There are more Syrian refugees in Zaatari than any other camp in the world. The dustbowl community’s meteoric surge in population within the past year prompted King Abdullah to call the site “Jordan’s fifth largest city.”
Aid Agencies Overwhelmed
Andrew Harper, UNHCR’s representative to Jordan, said that his group and other nongovernmental organizations dealing with the refugee crisis are strained.
“I don’t think you can think it can get any worse but it does every night,” said Harper. “There’s over a half million Syrians that have come through (into Jordan) since March of last year — anywhere up to 3,000 to 4,000 per night which basically means a thousand families. This means a thousand families with women and children who come across with nothing and we have to provide everything for them — the tents, the food, the water, the health facilities and the protection.”
Nadia Raja fled Syria with her husband and five children. They remain at the Zaatari refugee camp in Jordan where 120,000 are currently residing while the conflict in Syria continues.
Harper said that nearly $1 million is being spent per day to run the camp and construct another site to care for the refugees. He’s worried about the future of funding for Zaatari and other camps as the war in Syria continues to rage on month after month.
“No one can give me one positive indicator from Syria that this is going to be resolved any time soon — whether it be one year, two years or beyond that,” said Harper.
“We’ve got enough resources until the end of June. The United States has been very generous, a number of Western states have been very generous but that basically the needs as they exist now, not the needs that we are probably likely to expect coming across the mountains.”
Zaatari’s Desperate Residents
Despite a constant stream of aid trucks dropping off supplies including water (nearly 500 per day, according to UNHCR), highly organized distribution centers, medical facilities and schools in the camp, residents told us that they don’t have enough to eat, clean water to drink or adequate medical care.
The only thing here in ample supply seems to be despair.
One man waiting outside the UNHCR administrative gate attempted to tell anyone and everyone who passed through about his grievances at the camp. In a sign of desperation, he offered to light himself on fire in front of our camera to protest his living conditions. We declined his offer. He was immediately escorted back to the entrance gate by a security officer where the man continued to look for anyone who would listen.
In the camp’s version of a “Main Street” many impromptu businesses have opened. Refugees who manage to have or get money can purchase meat (chickens are slaughtered in plain sight), baked goods, drinks, clothing and many other items.

Twenty-year-old Abdul Mounim Droubi is able earn some wages working at a makeshift bakery on the merchant strip. His life, in some ways, is much better than those of others in the camp who are not working and have no access to additional income. He told us that his existence at Zaatari is no way to live and that he will likely be going back home despite the war.
“I have no hope,” he said in front of a lit oven at the market stall. “I’d rather die in Syria.”
Life Inside a Tent
At a section of the camp for some of its newest residents, we were quickly surrounded by a group of small children who were excited by the distraction of a foreign news crew with cameras. They asked to have their pictures taken and laughed as I showed them images of themselves in my view finder.
This is where we met Nadia Raja, the mother from Daraa, and her five children. She invited us inside her new home.
The Raja family tent is sparse with just a few sleeping mats atop a floor mat with UNHCR logos that serves as the floor of their new home. With each step inside, I could feel the large stones and pebbles underneath my feet.
Children hang laundry outside their tent in the refugee camp.
There’s no electricity and the temperature in the tent is easily 10 degrees hotter than the 95 degrees Fahrenheit outside. The tent is amazingly pristine which seems like a minor miracle with all the dust kicking around outside.
Even though there is no food left out, the Raja’s shelter has not been spared the flies that have infested the camp.
I noticed one of the family’s five children — sick with a fever — huddled in the corner clutching a water bottle as flies hover and land on his face and body. The boy, weakened from sickness and the heat, made no attempt to swat away the persistent insects.
Nadia Raja told us she doesn’t feel in danger since coming to Jordan a few weeks ago. It was the only positive statement about her life that she uttered during our 15-minute interview.
She told us her children have been sick for 20 days.
“They have fever. They are suffering from the hot weather. They are suffering from the polluted water — because there is not clean water — and from the situation in general from the camps. It’s too hot in the camp.”
Raja said she has no idea how long she will be living in Zaatari.
“We have no electricity, there’s no television and we don’t know what’s going on,” said Raja as her youngest child cried in her lap. “We are just hoping that God has the best for us.”
After the interview, as we packed up our vehicle to go on to the next site at the camp, Raja ran over, waving her Syrian cell phone number. She made sure all of us copied it down, hoping that the world wouldn’t forget about her family among the millions of Syrians displaced.

The number of Syrian refugees escaping to neighboring Jordan has surpassed 400,000 with thousands more arriving each day. Many of the refugees are children, who normally would be in school but instead are hunkering down in refugee camps.
International aid agencies and community groups are racing to create enough tent classrooms to accommodate them all.
“Some of the children have been out of school for months and months,” said Michele Servadei, deputy representative for UNICEF Jordan. So his organization and others, including Save the Children, are facilitating the creation of temporary classrooms to help the children catch up.
So far, there are two main schools in Jordan’s Zaatari refugee camp and a third one in the planning stages. Each school can hold about 5,000 students, though the demand keeps growing.
According to UNICEF’s figures, in October 2012 there were 2,400 school-aged children enrolled in the makeshift schools. Today, there are 34,000 school-aged children enrolled.
“We need to open the third school quickly,” Servadei said from Jordan.

Because Syria is a middle class country with a generally well-educated population, the aid groups can recruit teachers from within the refugee population. Some recruits already were teachers in Syria, but those who weren’t can be trained along with the other Jordanian teachers, said Servadei.
Both sets can contribute: the Syrians have expertise in dealing with Syrian children, and the Jordanians have the more formalized education training, “so it’s a good combination,” he said.
One of the issues that sometimes comes up is the potential for bullying between the refugee and host communities, Servadei said, so parent-teacher associations are organized to be on the lookout.
The refugee students are taught science, math and life skills and vocational training. One of the few deviations from the Syrian curriculum is that in Jordan, the students learn English as opposed to French in Syrian schools, he said.

One program, geared particularly for young children, lets the refugees express their feelings about the violence they witnessed through art. “The drawings can be pretty tough to look at, but it does help kids get through that trauma that they have experienced,” said Carolyn Miles, president and CEO of Save the Children.
As the fighting in Syria between pro- and anti-government forces continues, the refugee population in Jordan alone is estimated to reach 700,000 by July, she said. (The U.N. refugee agency keeps track of the numbers on its website.)
And among that refugee population, many feel a strong desire to learn, Servadei said from UNICEF’s office in Jordan. At the beginning of the year, he cited as an example, a snowstorm hit and more than 1,000 parents and children chose to live in the schools during the winter break. “They’re really eager to learn. We need to make sure we can increase the capacity” to accommodate them, he said.

At the end of his Middle East tour, President Barack Obama traveled to Amman, Jordan Friday to meet with King Abdullah II. Both countries’ leaders emphasized their strong alliance and commitment to security and peace in the region.
One of the highlights of their discussions was Syria and the growing refugee problem in neighboring Jordan. The Associated Press reported that the nation hosts 500,000 refugees from Syria or about 9 percent of Jordan’s total current population.
In the conference Friday, King Abdullah reported that his government anticipated the number of Syrians in Jordan could potentially double by the end of the year. “That would be like 30 million crossing over the border into the United States,” he said. He added that the Zaatari desert refugee camp is now the fifth largest city in Jordan.
Abdullah reasoned that action needed to be taken in order to avoid “prolonged sectarian conflict” in Syria. Inaction could “lead to the fragmentation of Syria and have disastrous effects on the region,” he said.
This sentiment was consistent with the king’s past statements. In 2012, when Abdullah visited the United States and told PBS senior correspondent Margaret Warner that he expected the “loss of life” to continue in Syria and that the key players “don’t really know what to do” about the conflict in the Middle Eastern country.
With a total of 70,000 Syrians dead, Abdullah voiced concern that the international community needed to step up, increasing humanitarian aid in Syria and for countries like Jordan playing host to Syrian refugees and preventing the radicalization of Syrian politics.
The influx of refugees — Abdullah said the Jordanian government would not close its borders to future refugees — has created social, economic and security concerns in his kingdom. “[We] have opened our arms to many throughout our history,” said Abdullah. But if the $550 million in costs related to Syrians fleeing to Jordan also doubles along with the number of total refugees in Jordan, Abdullah conceded that it will have a tremendous effect on the economy.
In February, the Obama administration disbursed another $60 million in humanitarian aid to the Syrian rebels to provide basic needs for war-torn communities, including sanitation, medical care and food delivery, as well as to build up the organizational capacity of the Syrian Opposition Coalition.
At the press conference Friday, President Obama reiterated the importance to find a political solution and announced his intentions to work with Congress in order to provide an additional $200 million to Jordan to assist in rising costs regarding ever-increasing numbers of refugees.
President Obama and King Abdullah also addressed the need for a two-state solution and reiterated the contributions and efforts of the U.S. and Jordanian governments to broker peace between Israelis and Palestinians.
While Jordan has remained a relatively stable country and ally of the U.S., Council on Foreign Relations’ Steven Cook wrote Thursday that there are many more reasons why King Abdullah is now is facing mounting pressures and tensions in the region and from within his Kingdom:
“In January the Jordanians held elections, there have been a spate of protests over food prices, strong criticism of the King from some of the monarchy’s heretofore strong tribal supporters. … The fact that Syria is in chaos, sectarian gangs rule Iraq, Egypt is in turmoil, and predictions of a 3rd Palestinian intifada abound places King Abdullah and his Kingdom in a more uncomfortable position than usual.”

As of Feb. 12, nearly 205,000 Syrians in Jordan had sought help from the U.N. refugee agency and other aid groups, and the number keeps rising.
Alexandra Brosnan, advocacy officer for the International Rescue Committee, visited Syrian refugees in Jordan at the main Zaatari camp in Mafraq, and those housed in other cities in Jordan along the Syrian border, in November. (Read about IRC’s findings.)
“When we were there, we saw a desperate situation where the host government and communities were doing their best to respond to the crisis, but we saw that the need was overwhelming,” she said.
About one-third of the refugees were in camps, but another 70 percent were spread around in cities along the border, making it harder for aid groups to find them and quantify their needs, she said. Because of the high rents, Brosnan said sometimes two or three families were squeezed into one-bedroom apartments.
And for the Jordanians who have taken in families, the length of the conflict is taking its toll. “We saw the host communities opening their doors, but at that time (November) we were beginning to see that the welcome might wear thin,” she added.
Clinics also are straining — not only addressing the immediate needs of Syrians injured by the war, but helping those with pre-existing maladies. Schools in Jordan are bulging with the influx of Syrian refugee children as well, she said.
Jordan’s King Abdullah pleaded for help from the international community at last month’s World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.
“I cannot emphasize enough the challenges that we are all facing, both in Jordan and Lebanon, and it’s only going to get worse,” he said, quoted the New York Times. “What we’re asking from the international community is not just to help us with the refugee problems and their challenges as they face this harsh winter, but also stockpiling in Jordan so that we can move supplies across the borders to keep people in place.”
The United Nations has sought $1.5 billion in aid for Syria — $1 billion for host countries supporting refugees and another $500 million to help Syrians within the war-torn country. Foreign governments met that goal in pledges at a donor conference last month in Kuwait. The United States has committed $365 million.
Meanwhile, the refugees are itching to go home. “We heard that over and over again: They want to start rebuilding Syria. It really pains them what’s happening there,” said Brosnan.
But even if there were a political solution tomorrow to Syria’s crisis, Brosnan said, “we’re worried refugees might not stream back immediately” because so many parts of the country are no longer livable, making the refugees’ temporary homes and means to earn a living all the more important today.

Syrian refugee Maryam Al Okla describes her living situation.
Maryam Al Okla is one of hundreds of thousands of Syrian refugees battling through winter in an unfamiliar place — living in cramped quarters with very little money and an uncertain future.
“At night it becomes really cold … because I don’t have diesel oil to heat the room. Our life is so miserable,” she recently told freelance journalist Paige Kollock in Bekaa Valley in Lebanon. You can watch Ray Suarez’s report on the refugee crisis in Lebanon on Wednesday’s PBS NewsHour.
Al Okla is renting a one-room home, basically a storage container, from a man in Lebanon. “Thanks to him for letting us stay here. No one else looked at us except him,” she said through a translator.
The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees estimates that as of January, about 755,400 refugees have fled the fighting in their home country and are living mostly in neighboring Lebanon, Jordan and Turkey.
According to the U.N. refugee agency:
Surveys of refugees reveal that they are beset by rising prices, a scarcity of livelihood opportunities and ballooning rents in the safer areas. Most refugees are entirely dependent on material assistance provided by UNHCR and other organizations.
“Two days ago, I told my husband I will return home (to Syria) even under the shelling because no one is taking care of us here,” Al Okla said. “But we are waiting. Maybe God will help us and relieve the situation.”

As the fighting in Syria continues, hundreds of thousands of civilians have fled their torched homes and battered neighborhoods to find refuge in bordering countries.
The United Nations has registered nearly 400,000 refugees in Turkey, Jordan, Lebanon and Iraq, with tens of thousands of additional Syrians who haven’t yet registered.
Foreign aid continues to stream in, but funding has fallen far short of what relief groups have requested. Making matters worse, winter is fast approaching.
To shed some light on the situation, we spoke with Daryl Grisgraber, a senior advocate for Refugees International, who recently traveled to Turkey, Jordan and Iraq to examine conditions for the displaced and those trying to help them. It was a follow-up to a visit to Lebanon and Jordan in May.
What was different this time around?
DARYL GRISGRABER: There is a large percentage of refugees not living in the camps in Turkey, but we can’t really tell the numbers at this point — we’ve heard estimates ranging from 30,000 to 300,000 of those in urban setting. There are about 10,000 to 12,000 people stuck at the border right now because the camps are at capacity and they’re just waiting for these new camps to be built.
The last time we left Jordan there were no camps set up yet, just these places called transit centers, which very quickly became overcrowded. Practically everyone from those centers was sent to a camp once they were set up. There are easily tens of thousands of refugees in the cities in Jordan. And that number is increasing because conditions in the camps are so bad and many refugees are picking up and leaving.
The camps in Iraq are relatively new — built around eight or nine months ago. The one we visited this time still feels very much in a developmental state. There is a school but it’s overcrowded and so they have to use it in shifts. There are activity centers but they’re used for shelter because it’s hard hit for space.
There was one major common thread that we saw in Jordan and Iraq and Turkey, and that was that the urban refugees are going to eventually run out of resources and have to move to camps. In Iraq alone, they’ve had to expand the camp four times since it was built just to accommodate the numbers.
How are camps dealing with the approaching winter?
DARYL GRISGRABER: Unfortunately, people aren’t preparing much. Everyone is aware that winter is coming. People are asking where they will get blankets and warmer shoes. It’s on everyone’s minds. But in a place like northern Iraq the people coming through are overwhelming the registration resources to such a degree that there really isn’t enough time to address other needs like preparing for changing seasons.
What will likely happen to the refugees if winter preparations are not fully addressed?
DARYL GRISGRABER: Keep in mind that the State Department just gave some money for winterization ($32 million in humanitarian aid last week), but with numbers increasing there’s no telling if that will be enough. The challenge is that it’s hard to project how many refugees will actually be in these camps a month or even a week from now.
But if preparations aren’t made there will be health problems. Colds and respiratory issues will rise and spread. And if people can’t find the living environment they need in the camps they may move into urban areas or if they’re living in urban areas you may see them trying to enter the camps. And if conditions are bad everywhere there is always the chance that they’ll return to Syria, because many feel if they’re going to die of the cold then they would rather do it in Syria.
What’s happening to Syrians who can’t cross the border?
DARYL GRISGRABER: There are a handful of humanitarian agencies operating inside Syria, some recognized by the government and others that are not, and they have provided some relief. But their efforts are very piecemeal because there they are so few in number and also because the conflict, as it moves, periodically stops operations for everyone. Overall, the relief operation inside Syria is neither adequate nor systemic.
How are refugees being treated in their host countries?
DARYL GRISGRABER: There is definitely a certain tension … where the international community comes in and says we’re here to help and the host communities feel they have needs, too. In Turkey, particularly in the border provinces, it felt like things weren’t very intense between refugees and citizens. But if you speak to refugees themselves they say they do feel some tension, inevitably.
How do refugees feel about their current situation?
DARYL GRISGRABER: I think everyone’s hope — literally everyone’s — is that they’ll be able to go back to Syria. Even people who would have security threats no matter who is in power — everyone wants to go back. It was amazing how many times in each country people said, if this battle ends in the next 24 hours we will go back to our country.
As far as the mood, though, that has shifted. People had the idea in May that the conflict would last just a few weeks, that they’d only have to be in the camps for a short while. But in October the mood was noticeably different. Everyone knows it now as a prolonged conflict, and that is taxing. I heard some people were considering going to Egypt. And others were considering returning to Syria, saying, “I’d rather die there than here where I’m a refugee.”

YAYLADAGI, Turkey — It’s a brilliant fall morning in Yayladagi #1, a refugee camp on the grounds of a former tobacco processing factory in southern Turkey. We’re just three miles from the Syrian border, and camp translator Jamal Akgol is showing us down the rows of waxed canvas tents constructed to house thousands of refugees fleeing the carnage at home. “Whatever they need, they have,” Akgol said with some pride. “And they do not have to pay for anything.”
Every tent boasts a TV satellite dish and an electricity hookup to power its lights, heater, refrigerator and cooktop. The old stucco tobacco warehouses now provide classrooms for the 1,000-plus children, a medical clinic, showers and laundry facility with washing machines. Street sweepers even patrol the walkways armed with dustbin and brush.

The Turks set up this camp in May 2011 for people fleeing the Syrian army’s initial assaults on protestors against President Bashar al-Assad. It rapidly filled to its 2,400 capacity, the first wave in a flood of some 115,000 who’ve taken shelter in Turkey’s government-run camps. “Neither they nor we know when they’ll go back,” Akgol said. “But there’s nothing on the other side for them. Over there, they would die from attacks, or hunger.”
We saw the truth of that on Wednesday, at a makeshift camp for displaced people about three miles on the other side of the Syrian border, near the town of Atmeh in Idlib Province. Hastily constructed just two months ago by a young Aleppo man who calls himself Farouk, it rapidly filled with 3,000 people who’d been driven from home by the regime’s latest campaign of aerial bombardment in areas held by the rebel Free Syrian Army.
“We escaped at first light one morning, before the bombing started again,” said Khadejah Al Darwish, who arrived with her husband and 11 children. “We wanted to go to Turkey, but they won’t let us in now.”
With the help of foreign donors, Farouk bought 300 tents with sturdy foundations and tarps, and foam mattresses for beds. But that initial bequest was spent, and Farouk said his Qah Camp depends almost entirely on a steady but insufficient stream of money from IHH, a Turkish nongovernmental organization. Camp residents must subsist on half-rations of prepared meals. There are no blankets unless the residents carried them in, no lights or heaters inside the tents, and there are just 12 bathrooms for all 3,000 people.
As we walked through the camp, Farouk was besieged with entreaties from distressed residents. “That father just told me it gets to zero degrees at night, and he has nothing to keep his children warm,” Farouk said. “We want to help these people more, but there is not enough money.”
The contrast between these two camps is a vivid example of why Syria’s neighbors — Turkey, Jordan and Lebanon — have been swamped with refugees from the 20-month-old Syrian conflict — some 400,000, the U.N. estimated this week. And that’s just in the registered camps. There are countless tens of thousands of others who’ve entered neighboring countries to take up residence in Turkish, Jordanian and Lebanese cities.
Turkey’s total soared past what officials had called its “psychological limit” of 100,000 several weeks ago. While it’s building more camps, Turkey’s border guards are now blocking entry to Syrians without passports. And that’s most poor Syrians.
No matter where they’ve found shelter, the displaced Syrians we talked to share one feeling — a desperate desire to return home.
Khadejah Al Darwish with nine of her 11 children talks to Margaret Warner (on right).
“My husband was a teacher, we had a normal life,” Darwish said, sitting in her tent in Camp Haq surrounded by nine of her children. “I want my family to have that again.”
Forty miles to the south, in Camp Yayladagi, 24-year-old Amani Kanibo whiles away the time by making pro-revolutionary artwork out of painted seeds, grains and wood. She held her 6-year-old son Hassan close, saying, “I want my children to go back to their land. They are losing their future here.”
Those displaced by the Syrian conflict also seem to share another sentiment — that they’ll need international intervention to achieve their dream. Said Darwish: “We need the rest of the world to help us get rid of Bashar al-Assad, so we can get home.”
But given the continuing disagreement among the U.S., its European allies, Russia, China and Syria’s neighbors about what to do, Darwish and Kanibo may have a long time to wait.

While fighting rages between government and rebel forces in Syria, and the international community debates what to do about the conflict, Syrian refugees are just trying to survive and make their lives as normal as possible away from home.
Many refugees are less consumed by thoughts of regime change than of more immediate concerns of finding housing, paying rent and feeding their families, said Michael Shaikh, Syria country director at the Campaign for Innocent Victims in Conflict.
The privately funded nonprofit based in Washington, D.C., seeks to make warring parties more responsible to civilians, before, during and after conflict, and to limit the harm to them on the battlefield.
In Syria, because the warring parties — the government under President Bashar al-Assad and a loosely knit opposition known as the Free Syrian Army — are unresponsive, CIVIC must look to other means to protect civilians.
“We don’t have any leverage with either of these warring parties right now, but there are still a variety of civilian protection issues that the Lebanese, Jordanian or Turkish governments can impact, Washington can impact though pressuring its allies, the Group of Friends of Syria with money, and political advocacy can do in terms of pressuring Damascus for access to the International Committee of the Red Cross,” said Shaikh. “We’re trying to expand the space for others that can impact civilian lives in a positive way.”
Toward that goal of influencing those who can make a difference, Shaikh spent seven weeks in June and July interviewing Syrians, armed opposition, demonstrators, aid agencies, and government officials in Jordon, Turkey and Lebanon about the needs of Syrians and how they could be addressed.

The needs, he found, were great. Not only were refugees trying to adjust to life in another country and meet the daily needs of their families, they often were suffering from the trauma of escaping shelling in their hometowns. “If you’ve ever lived through that, it’s an incredibly profound and frightening thing,” said Shaikh (pictured above). “Particularly the people in Homs who experienced this for nearly a month, it really can break someone mentally, and these people needed psychological attention.”
Are they getting it? In some cases yes, but in most cases no, he said. “Some international aid agencies in Lebanon and now Jordan are stepping up to answer those needs, but there’s still a huge gap in what is needed and what it provided.”
The United Nations has asked for about $200 million to meet Syrians’ basic needs, but only about one-quarter has been funded by the international community, said Shaikh.
The State Department on Thursday released a breakdown of the $76 million the United States is spending to help Syrians inside and outside the country.
Reporters and aid agencies are having difficulty gaining permission to enter Syria, but information coming from refugees paints a stark picture of what is happening inside the country.
It appears hospitals and medical staff are targets of the regime, said Shaikh. Hospitals are being destroyed or occupied for military purposes, and those with injuries are denied treatment, he said. “We got the general impression that anyone who had a war wound in Syria was perceived by the government as being loyal to the opposition and thus were being denied medical attention.”
He said some doctors and medical staff he interviewed described threats to their lives or colleagues they knew who were killed or arrested because the government perceived them as supporting the opposition.
Shaikh said he has briefed State Department, U.N. agencies and other officials with his findings.

Refugees also are suffering from idleness, whether they are confined to camps or simply can’t find jobs. “People just want to work, and the vast majority of these people just have nothing to do,” he added. “It doesn’t do much for the body and soul. They want to work, even if it’s menial labor. It’s giving people a purpose even just for a few days or weeks.”
The conflict is taking a toll on the members of the Syrian army, too, said Shaikh. Military defectors told him some Syrian soldiers would break the chain of command and refuse to fire a weapon when told to, purposefully sabotage weapons, or slow down operations to give civilians time to move. “They didn’t want to fire on their own people.”
When their superiors found out, they were either executed on the spot or arrested and tortured, the defectors told him. He said he also heard that high-ranking Syrian military members would tell soldiers if you’re going to defect, make sure you take your family with you or they’ll be in trouble, which would work as a deterrent.
“That’s not to excuse the brutal actions of the Syrian military, but it highlights some of the real human and complex decisions that people are making to try to protect civilians, in a way.”
In some cases, he said, members of the military would defect — sometimes because they were ordered to go to battle in their hometowns — and they would return to fight as opposition in their neighborhood. “It’s really local in that sense,” he added.
Shaikh, who was born in Ohio of Pakistani parents, said even though he’s researched troubled nations for a decade, the situation in Syria was different. “I was kind of worried I was getting numb to this stuff because I was doing it so long, but for some reason Syria knocked something loose,” he said.
“It’s not the numbers of people who are dying in this war. Don’t get me wrong, it’s shocking. If the numbers are right, 20,000 is pretty shocking on so many different levels. But in Syria it’s the way people are dying — the disproportionate shelling, the targeting of medical staff, the denial of medical care, it’s the sniper fire that we’ve heard so much of — random in its targets but exact in its execution. War is always dreadful, but for some reason this seems particularly dreadful to me.”

Sudanese taking refuge in a tent camp in Jamam, South Sudan, may have escaped the fighting around their homes but are finding their plight is not over yet.
The refugees have traveled from the Blue Nile region along the border of Sudan and South Sudan to escape fighting between Sudanese government forces and the local army, which wants no influence from the North.
But the Jamam camp, where they have fled, is “not a safe place for them to be” either, said Peter Struijf of Oxfam, according to an Independent Television News report. “We are very worried about disease outbreaks. We need someone at a higher level to make a strategic decision to solve this problem once and for all and that probably means moving most people out of Jamam. If not all.”
New refugees are arriving daily, and the camp has swelled to about 40,000 people. The U.N. refugee agency is working to move people to more stable areas, but the rainy season has washed out roads and makes it challenging to move large numbers by bus or truck.

“It wasn’t a planned camp,” explained Fredeeric Cussigh, head of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees’ field office. “It was a self-created camp where refugees settled. It’s a de facto camp rather than an organized camp.”
One of the residents of the camp, Efendi Badi el-Tom, the head of the Ingessana people who live in the hill country of eastern Sudan, said he doesn’t blame UNHCR. “I blame [Sudanese President] Omar al-Bashir because if he hadn’t shot and bombed us, we would have avoided all this. We are mountain people. The Ingessana people want to go home and find peace and finish this terrible war. Our hearts are broken.”

https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/globalhealth-july-dec11-lgbt_12-04,refugee,2271,2011-12-04T17:51:00-05:00,None,The Gray Area of Gay Refugees,"NAIROBI, Kenya — The two tender, soft-spoken Ugandans shared a circle of good friends back in their hometown of Kampala. They were close with their families and they started a restaurant together. Life was good.
That was before everything went wrong. They were disowned by their families. Their restaurant was burned down. Their car was stoned and set ablaze.
And so they fled Uganda and came here, thousands of kilometers east with little more than the clothes on their backs. They came as brothers to live in a scorching refugee camp in northern Kenya. Surrounded by thousands of others who have fled wars and drought in neighboring countries, they came here to save their own lives.
These two men are not rebel soldiers. They are not fleeing war or drought, and they aren’t really brothers. They are lovers, and they came here to escape what they feared would be certain death after being outed last year in a country where homosexuality is widely considered a mortal sin, as “unnatural” as it is “un-African.”
Alex and his partner Michael — whose real names cannot be used because of a continued threat of violence against them — were the target of a series of violent attacks inspired, they say, by an American evangelical campaign that began in 2009, and inspired legislation that, if passed, would have made gay acts punishable by the death penalty.
“I’m not a fighter,” said Alex, a former youth and community leader back in Uganda.
He is timid, unwilling to throw his elbows against hardened Somalis and Sudanese in the food line at the camp. As a result, he now shows signs of malnourishment.
Today the men have been pushed to their limits, living as refugees far from their friends, family and allies. Although they had hoped for a better life in a new land, the camp has proven to be yet another dangerous place for the two polite young Ugandans.
“LGBT people are perhaps the most persecuted group in the world,” said Neil Grungras, founder of the Organization for Refuge, Asylum & Migration (ORAM). “They are persecuted in countries of origin, but neighboring countries share similar cultural values. If you go across the border, you’re not any less likely to be persecuted.”
After all, homosexuality is illegal in Kenya too.
Flight over Fight
David Kato, a leading young gay rights activist in Uganda, was bludgeoned to death with a hammer in his own apartment in January. Months earlier a local tabloid newspaper had published the names, photographs and addresses of Ugandans believed to be gay, including Kato. A banner on the front page read: “Hang Them.”
Alex and Michael were good friends of Kato’s, but they continued to live their lives as homosexuals in private — not as activists, just as normal albeit closeted gay citizens. But even that proved untenable.
They were followed, called out on the streets, and after their restaurant went up in flames in April, one of Alex’s relatives finally gave him a grave warning.
“If you have any money, leave the country,” she advised. “You know, they are planning on killing you. You are putting shame on the family, and even the whole clan. They are planning for your death.”
A month later, the couple entered a supermarket, and came out to find their car engulfed in flames. In one of the hardest decisions of their lives, they packed their life belongings into two suitcases, and boarded a bus to Nairobi. Only one bag actually made it, and they arrived in Nairobi desperate for help.
Life as Refugees
After six months in the refugee camp, Alex and Michael have become accustomed to the whispered taunting of the other refugees. “Here comes Miss Uganda … ” is a familiar refrain.
Life in the camp hasn’t been much of an improvement for either of them, and this month they marked their six-year anniversary as a couple without any kind of celebration.
The Kenyan government does not grant asylum to LGBT refugees because of its law barring homosexual acts, leaving people like Alex and Michael in legal limbo.
Although the couple has been in touch with a United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) counselor, they feel they are not receiving enough protection. They have been told there is little that can be done, and that their only real option is resettlement in a Western country.
“Honestly, the fear is now increasing,” said Alex.
Refugees from vehemently anti-homosexual societies like Sudan, Somalia and Ethiopia surround them, and beliefs and attitudes don’t change by simply crossing a border.
According to Alex, when they revealed to their UNHCR counselor that instances of being called “gay” in the camp were increasing, the counselor’s response was, “Well, aren’t you?”
Improper handling of situations like this is widespread, says ORAM founder Grungas.
“It’s not enough to treat them like every other refugee,” said Grungas, referring to the unique danger of violence for LGBTs if other refugees discover their true identities. “There are no mechanisms to protect them in the camps.”
ORAM is one of several organizations that have begun to take a systematic focus towards assisting LGBT refugees and asylum seekers, such as HIAS (Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society), and Refugee Law Project in Uganda. Still, Grungas says, “it’s a real hodgepodge of who’s ready and able to assist in these matters.”
The refugee camp has had draining physical and mental effects on both men. Alex says that Michael often cries throughout the night, and has become both extremely depressed and afraid of people. He is still slowly trying to recover, but finds it difficult with little to occupy his time in the camp aside from his own thoughts.
Looking through photographs of the couple from less than a year ago, one of the few valuables they were able to bring with them, it is clear that Alex’s body has shrunken drastically.
“You know this refugee life — we’ve got many problems here. The food they give you is the same for a 1-year-old. Three kilos of wheat flower, 1/2 kilo of beans, and a 1/2 liter of oil for two weeks. It’s not enough.”
At one point, things got so bad that they almost considered going back to Uganda.
“We ran because we feared death. But what sort of life do we have here? If we die in our country, at least it can bring to attention what’s happening. If we die here, no one will know anything,” Alex said.
“We have been surviving. But it feels like we’re going to be in the camp all our life, because even here in Kenya they won’t allow us, they can’t accept us.”
Roots of Hate
This month, UK Prime Minister David Cameron threatened to place aid restrictions on nations that do not respect gay rights, part of a larger campaign in Commonwealth countries.
Both Uganda and Nigeria, which is also considering new anti-gay legislation, are large recipients of UK aid, and were no doubt targets of Cameron’s rhetoric. Those receiving aid should “adhere to proper human rights” regarding religion and sexuality, Cameron said.
In response, the BBC reported, Ugandan presidential advisor John Nagenda said Cameron was demonstrating a “bullying mentality.” He added, “If they must take their money, so be it.” Nigeria and Zambia have had similar responses.
Restricting aid would probably have little affect on the situation, however. In both Kenya and Uganda, it’s not simply the government, “it’s the people, the community, that is causing the problems,” said Alex.
Anti-homosexual sentiments run deep across the African continent, and in most African societies, homosexuality is considered immoral, “un-African,” “un-Christian” and a threat to the traditional fabric of society. Others claim it to be an import of the West.
Out of 54 African nations, 38 have laws criminalizing homosexual acts to various extents — yet Uganda has been particularly aggressive in recent years. With over 500,000 gays reported to be living in Uganda, the risks of living openly are rising.
The recent tidal wave of anti-gay attitudes in the country began in 2009, when a new anti-homosexuality bill — dubbed the “Kill the Gays Bill” because it would introduce the death sentence for some gay acts and a minimum of life imprisonment for all gays and lesbians — was introduced to the Ugandan Parliament.
Several newspapers reported that the bill stemmed from a workshop held by three evangelical preachers from the United States earlier that year, including Caleb Lee Brundidge, a former gay man who conducts “homosexual healing” sessions, and Scott Lively, a well known anti-gay activist and president of Defend the Family International. The workshop reportedly preached about the “gay agenda,” and the societal evils caused by homosexuality, comparing it to things like bestiality and rape.
MP David Bahati, who introduced the bill, claimed it was to protect “the legal, religious, and traditional family values of the people of Uganda against the attempts of sexual rights activists seeking to impose their values of sexual promiscuity on the people of Uganda.”
Instead, it rapidly stoked the flames of a new anti-gay movement.
The Anti-Homosexuality Bill was eventually tabled for later discussion, and observers say it will likely never pass because of both internal and external pressures. However it was supported openly by President Yoweri Museveni, and recently leaked WikiLeaks cables from U.S. Ambassador to Uganda Jerry Lanier claimed that First Lady Janet Museveni herself was behind the legislation.
Dangerous Neighbors
GlobalPost was specifically asked by an agency of the Kenyan government not to cover this story. The reason, speculated an official at the UNHCR, was that not only would it potentially “put at risk” Alex and Michael in the camp, but that causing a stir around their situation could give the couple unfair advantage to gain resettlement.
While this has some truth to it, another reason may be more complex. Kenya has its own anti-gay sentiments — similar to those in Uganda, though they less often result in severe violence. Providing refuge to gay foreigners while ignoring the issue on the homefront could present a contradictory policy to the public.
In 2007 the Pew Global Attitudes Project discovered that 96 percent of Kenyans said that homosexuality should be “rejected by society.” David Kuria, a prominent gay rights activist in Kenya and executive director of Gay Kenya Trust, an advocacy and support organization, agrees that Kenya is an extremely homophobic society, but says it differs from Uganda in that it lacks political endorsement for violence.
In Uganda, high-ranking politicians often make extremely homophobic statements. James Nsaba Buturo, the former minister of state for ethics and integrity, said, when it comes to homosexuals, “We are talking about anal sex. Not even animals do that,” and “we believe there are limits to human rights.”
This type of speech, and in many cases worse, validates and justifies the violence, Kuria claims. “The government creates a sense of impunity for the people to act.”
Ironically, anti-sodomy laws introduced under British colonial rule are the reason why homosexual acts are still illegal in Kenya and Uganda.
Road to Resettlement
After months of torment in Uganda and now Kenya, Alex and Michael’s journey toward a place where they can live freely under their real identities has just begun.
The couple now faces a long and murky legal battle towards resettlement, entering a gray area of migration that has been hard to define — or prove. While tribal, ethnic and even religious distinctions are often traced through ancestries, regions and sometimes even physical features, sexual preference is a much more ambiguous form of oppression. Simply put, it’s hard to confirm “gay.”
Alex and Michael are currently waiting out the bureaucratic process for resettlement through the UNHCR, yet for others who have landed in a country where they can attempt to claim asylum, the process can be even more painstaking.
In most countries, to seek asylum gay applicants must provide proof of imminent risk and/or previous incidents, such as medical reports of abuse, affidavits from partners or police, and more. In countries where homosexuality is illegal these things are not easy to obtain.
And even if refugees can prove they are gay, governments often ask questions about whether LGBTs can live their lives in secret in their countries of origin — or have been outed to such a level where they would face immediate persecution or death upon return.
International outrage fell upon the Czech Republic last year when it attempted to verify gay asylum seekers by attaching genital cuffs and monitoring their arousal when watching gay porn. Although the Fundamental Rights Agency criticized the measure, it illustrated the government’s intense concern about fraud.
In 2009, Stephen and Helen Mahoney, naturalized U.S. citizens from Russia living in Kent, Washington, pleaded guilty to charges of “conspiracy to commit immigration fraud” after coaching straight asylum seekers on how to pass themselves as gay — for fees upwards of $4,000.
The odds are stacked against all refugees, gay or straight. Of the more than 10 million refugees worldwide, only an estimated 100,000 are resettled each year.
Given community-led violence against gays and high-level political reinforcement of homophobia in his homeland, Alex fears he and Michael will never again be able to return to Uganda.
With few options before him, and currently no help from outside agencies, Alex has relied on his faith to keep him positive and driven.
Alex describes himself as a devout Christian. He says he finds great incongruity between the intense religiosity of his country and the idea of bashing gay “sinners.” He says he didn’t choose to be gay.
“God did,” he said.

A group of refugees in South Sudan must pick up and leave what they thought was a safe haven after bombs dropped by northern government forces came perilously close last week — but many do not want to move.
Despite a 2005 comprehensive peace agreement between Sudan and newly independent South Sudan, clashes between northern government forces and militias from the northern branch of the Sudan People’s Liberation Movement, the ruling party in South Sudan, have continued along the North-South border in the areas of Southern Kordofan and Blue Nile state.
About 22,000 people have fled the dangers of Southern Kordofan and congregated in the Yida refugee camp in Unity state in South Sudan. Last week, northern Sudanese air forces dropped five bombs near the refugee camp.
It’s unknown whether the Sudanese military, which has been fighting rebels in the area, was targeting the camp or whether the bombs went astray, said George Okoth Obbo, director of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees’ Africa bureau, based in Geneva, Switzerland. UNHCR staff working at the site reported no casualties, he said.
Sudan Armed Forces spokesman Sawarmi Khaled Saad denied the military was behind the aerial bombardment, telling Agence France-Presse, “This information is completely false. We didn’t bomb any camps or any areas inside the borders of South Sudan.”
Even before last week’s bombing, the U.N. refugee agency was concerned about the location of the camp because of security reasons — it’s too close to the border — and because it’s difficult to access due to heavy rains washing out roads, said Okoth Obbo. Aid groups have had to use helicopters to bring staff, food and other supplies into the area, he said.
Watch an Al Jazeera English report on the situation in the Yida camp:
Many aid workers left the camp after the bombing, and now relief agencies are trying to move the camp’s inhabitants to another settlement further inside South Sudan. Once the washed-out roads become passable again, aid groups will start the move to the new camp, said Okoth Obbo.
But some refugees are reluctant to leave. They want to stick close to home so they can monitor developments with the hopes that they can return in a few days. “This is not unusual, especially in the early stages of an emergency,” he said.
A similar situation is unfolding in another part of the country. About 30,000 Sudanese have congregated at the border with Ethiopia to escape the violence in Blue Nile state. There, Okoth Obbo said, aid workers are trying to gather the Sudanese evacuees in the Tongo refugee camp in western Ethiopia in order to more easily supply medical and other care to those who need it. But instead of entering the camp in Ethiopia, many Sudanese are staying in communities along the border.
“As the numbers are growing now … the capacity of the border areas and local communities to be able to assist such a large number became stretched, and that’s why we are trying to encourage the refugees to take advantage of the facilities which are available in the settlement that has been established,” he said.
The refugee situation isn’t just tied to fighting within the country. Hundreds of thousands of South Sudanese who moved to the North during a two decade-long civil war are returning home now that South Sudan is an independent country. In some cases, it’s a home they barely remember, or have never seen if they were born while in the North.
The birth of the new nation raises the issue of citizenship and the need for new laws to specify people’s rights, said Okoth Obbo. And there’s an urgency to the matter: Southern Sudanese who live in the north have nine months from the country’s independence day on July 9, 2011, to either leave or legalize their stay, according to the International Organization for Migration.
The exodus to the South began a year ago, before the vote for independence. Since October 2010, some 330,000 people have moved from the North — mainly Khartoum — to the South, said Okoth Obbo. “This has been fairly difficult for logistical and security reasons, and for the fact that people would arrive back in the South to a place some of them have never seen,” he said.
So the International Organization for Migration, the U.N. refugee agency and other aid organizations are helping transport the southern Sudanese back to the South by any means possible — planes, trains and river barges.

Photo by Tony Karumba/AFP/Getty Images.
The heavy rains soaking the Dadaab refugee camp in Kenya — the largest in the world — would normally mean sweet relief for the many refugees who fled drought and famine conditions in Somalia.
During the rainy season the brutal heat subsides, green sprouts appear in the desert, and the few livestock in the camp can finally graze, said Kassie Mcilvaine the director of refugee operations for CARE, who is working in Dadaab.
But this year the rains have also caused an uptick in cholera, a potentially deadly disease caused by a bacteria that spreads through contaminated water.
“[The rain] is a joy and blessing because it brings growth and greenery, but it does not help with hygiene conditions,” Mcilvaine said.
One person has died from cholera, and 60 are sick in the camp, the U.N. High Commission on refugees reported this week. In a camp of 460,000 people, with new arrivals every day, an infectious disease like cholera can spread quickly. The outbreak is believed to have started among new arrivals to the camp and was exacerbated by the rains.
“Rains and flooding had affected the trucking of water to parts of the camps, and we fear some refugees resorted to using unsafe water from flooded areas,” Andrej Mahecic, a spokesperson for the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees told reporters.
About 10 percent of the latrines in the camp have collapsed as well, Mcilvaine said. Relief workers are scrambling to make repairs and add extra chlorine to the water sources in the camp to kill the bacteria that causes cholera. Camp organizers are getting the world out about proper sanitation and distributing soap with food rations.
The U.N. is watching the situation closely and has rehydration treatment ready should the number of cases increase. The fact that the camp has been around so long, and has a strong infrastructure for both water provision and health services should help prevention and treatment efforts, Mcilvaine said.
But with so many people living in close quarters the situation could evolve quickly.
“They are living side by side, acre after acre, in rows,” she said. “It’s very much a large urban sprawl in the middle of the desert.”

DOLO ADO, Ethiopia | The Hilaweyn refugee camp was set up just a few weeks ago and it already looks like any other dusty small town anywhere in rural Africa.
Life goes on for this new community along a busy main street that has evolved across from a water point set up by the United Nations, where small shops display pots and pans and household goods, tailors on foot-cranked machines sew colorful fabric and a small gasoline generator recharges cell phones which, unlike grid electricity, are abundant here.
However, little is normal about this new normal for the 135,000 Somali refugees who’ve reached this and three other camps in a few miles inside Ethiopia from the Somali border (another 500,000 made the trek to camps in northern Kenya before fighting closed that escape route).

Even though it is their first taste of peace, adequate food and medical care, the future is clouded by uncertainty and will long bear the scars of their ordeal of terror and scarcity.
For example, in the camp hospital set up by the aid group Doctors Without Borders, repairing the complications of malnutrition takes much more intervention than a tube of plumpy nut, the popular peanut-rich food supplement. Dozens of young children cling to life, many fitted with nasal feeding tubes into which carefully measured formula feedings are delivered to their withered bodies.
“We can’t throw too much at them at one time,” says Dr. Benjamin Levy, a Michigan native who has worked here for eight weeks. Severely malnourished children are especially vulnerable to infections, including diarrhea 10 to 20 times a day and deadly pneumonias.
“Often times in America our bodies are able to isolate infection, place it into one lung in a specific region,” Levy said. “These children are getting fluid building up in both lungs and it causes severe respiratory distress.”
The toll all this takes on the children’s learning capacity is yet unknown. Education is further down the hierarchy of needs here, though the U.N is planning to open schools in the camps. It would be the first taste of any formal education in two generations in many refugee families.

“We don’t read or write, we need to be educated,” said Hassan Kulow, who survived a 12-day donkey cart ride to get to Ethiopia with his wife and five small children. “We need (education) facilities so we can catch up with the rest of the world.”
Like his neighbors, he hopes to be resettled in a third country. Somalia — stricken by drought and conflict — is not an option, most refugees insist.
Resettlement — if and when it happens — is not likely to be swift in a time of severe budget cutting and recession in most countries that have historically taken in Somali refugees: Canada has received about 200,000 since the mid-’80s, about twice the number as Britain, the second-largest recipient country. Some 85,000 Somalis live in the United States.
The line here to join them is much larger than in previous exoduses. In addition to the arrivals into Ethiopia, about 500,000 refugees fled into camps in northern Kenya in recent months before Kenyan troops moved in to engage the al-Qaida-affiliated al-Shabab militants in the border region, effectively stopping any civilian migration. Aid workers are bracing themselves for another spike if the conflict abates and security improves. An estimated 1.5 million Somalis are considered internally displaced, refugees in their own country and far more difficult to service.

For now, like so many refugees, aid providers must deal with more immediate, urgent priorities. The U.N. World Food Program and the private aid groups it partners with say the shelves are adequately stocked through early next year. But they already are actively seeking funds to sustain the camps beyond then, a task complicated by economics, politics and donor fatigue.
Famine is just never going to attract the news cameras like an earthquake or flood, says the WFP’s Jaako Valli. It doesn’t help that the Somali refugee crisis — though acute now — has been around for more than two decades. And the only news from Somalia getting much attention recently has been about piracy and terrorism.

The humanitarian crisis in Somalia continues to deepen by the day. A recent spate of kidnappings of relief workers is preventing aid from reaching those most in need, and now troops from neighboring Kenya have entered Somalia to try to push the militant Islamic group al-Shabab away from its border.
Because of security concerns, many aid organizations have withdrawn their staff from the country and are relying on local partners to distribute supplies. The Islamic militant group al-Shabab, which is locked in battle with Somalia’s weakened transitional government, is restricting the entry of international organizations from areas under its control anyway, saying it will care for the residents.
U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees Antonio Guterres recently visited the Somali capital Mogadishu and refugee camps along the Ethiopian border and spoke of his frustration.
“I cannot describe how terrible it is to feel that you have people dying, children dying and that you cannot reach them. To know that there is a relatively easy solution to their plight if resources would be made available and access would be granted,” he told us last week.
Even those who reach the refugee camps encounter an unusually high mortality rate: an average of seven deaths per 10,000 people per day in the Dolo Ado refugee camps in Ethiopia, said Guterres. “It’s the worst I’ve seen in any situation in the world.”
We asked him more about the current aid crisis in Somalia (some answers were edited for length):
What did you see while you were in Somalia?
ANTONIO GUTERRES: To me what was very clear was the devastating impact of the drought compounded by conflict. I had already witnessed in Dolo Ado in Ethiopia and Dadaab in Kenya how people coming from Somalia had suffered tremendously. I met one woman who had been walking for two weeks and who had lost three of her children on the way.
This is the kind of drama you see multiplied on an enormous scale because you still have inside Somalia more than 1 million people without effective humanitarian aid because of the difficulties of access. I could not leave Mogadishu and outside the city humanitarian access is still extremely limited. And even inside the city, humanitarian workers are in danger. We have seen recently a number of humanitarian workers being kidnapped — two colleagues from Medecins Sans Frontieres (Doctors Without Border) in Dadaab camp in Kenya, and three colleagues from a Danish NGO in the Galkayo area of Somalia.

Has the United Nations adjusted its tactics in light of the access problems?
ANTONIO GUTERRES: There are different possibilities of access depending on the nature of the organizations. When food aid is essential, the World Food Program is crucial inside Somalia. But unfortunately, Shabab doesn’t allow the World Food Program to operate in the areas controlled by it. And so the International Committee of the Red Cross has the capacity to deliver food assistance in some areas of south-central Somalia under Shabab control.
Other organizations, including ours, UNHCR, but not in the food distribution but in shelter and non-food items, through our partners have been able to access some areas under Shabab control. But it has been impossible until now to create a formula in which all areas of south-central Somalia under Shabab control can be supported, and that means that we still leave a larger percentage of the population totally without the basic assistance they need to overcome the challenge of hunger and disease.
How many Somalis have been able to reach the refugee camps?
ANTONIO GUTERRES: We now have 940,000 Somali refugees in Kenya, Ethiopia and Djibouti, and those are assisted by UNHRC, other refugee agencies and NGOs trying to respond to their basic needs in food, shelter, and health, and — whenever we can — in education for the children.
Is the entry of Kenyan troops into Somalia helping or hurting?
ANTONIO GUTERRES: It’s difficult to have an assessment because the military operation is just unfolding now. I think the objective of the Kenyan authorities is to guarantee security in the areas that are close to the Kenyan border. For the moment, the impact of the fighting in those border areas has been to stop the movement of the population. So the number of people coming into that refugee camp on the Kenyan side of the border is very small.

What can the international community do?
ANTONIO GUTERRES: I think it’s important for the international community to fully support AMISOM (African Union troops from Uganda and Burundi) in Mogadishu. That force is dramatically ill-equipped. They lack all kinds of resources. It is absolutely essential that there is effective support — especially from countries that are not ready to send their soldiers to Somalia — for AMISOM to have the number of people and equipment needed to do their mandate. If they are strong enough and well-equipped it will be much easier for them to fully respect human rights, which is also another very important dimension in the peace-keeping mission, especially when there’s no peace to keep.
On the other hand, I think it’s very important that the international community acts in a coordinated way to allow for the roadmap — that was established in a recent meeting in Mogadishu of many of the key actors of the Somali political process — to move forward to a political solution.

The World Food Program is providing rations to more than 7.4 million people affected by the drought, and more than 456,000 refugees have converged on the Dadaab camps in Kenya in search of security and daily meals.
The WFP “food basket” of rations provided to refugees from the crisis is made up of staple ingredients and a corn soya blend fortified with nutrients. An entire day’s ration comes to 2,178 calories per person. See how that breaks down for an average rationed meal below.
Meal nutritional values were calculated by dividing daily rations by three. Sources: WFP, USDA
In reality, individual consumption may be much lower than the full ration provided, said the International Medical Corps, which has been providing nutrition and health services in the camps in Kenya.
Refugees may trade or sell part of their food allotment to get other items they need, the IMC said, and the rations are low on animal protein when consumed on their own.
“Malnutrition is not merely a result of too little food, but of a more complex set of issues including insufficient protein, energy and micronutrients in the foods available to refugee families,” said Miel Hendrickson, East Africa coordinator for the International Medical Corps.
The WFP emphasizes there are other sources of nutrition provided for populations particularly at risk: children under the age of 2 receive a protein-rich supplement paste, like a fortified peanut paste, as part of the rations, and women who are breastfeeding receive “super cereal” fortified with nutrients. Children enrolled in school programs also can receive a school ration during the day.
The supplement paste is an essential tool against malnutrition, said Stephane Doyon, nutrition adviser for Doctors Without Borders.
“This is a ready to use paste that is 25 percent dairy … which is highly fortified with key nutrients,” he said. “Children have small stomachs so when you fill the stomach you have to fill it with something that is nutrient dense.”
He applauded the famine aid response for its focus on providing the correct balance of nutrients, especially for young children. Often food aid does not contain the fortified foods needed to prevent malnutrition, he said.
Just last week, the World Health Organization said it will recommend tighter nutritional standards for food aid, something Doctors Without Borders has been pushing. The new guidelines will include increases in vitamins and minerals included in food aid products.
Doyon also noted that there are some weaknesses in the food distribution system that need to be addressed.
“Not everybody is registered [in the camps], so not everybody will receive a ration,” he said. “Delays in distribution can also mean reduced rations.”
Rene McGuffin, spokeswoman for the World Food Program in Washington, said the East Africa famine response has experienced no major delays. The system is one of the most efficient in the world, she said, and when the program does experience breaks in supplies it is usually due to funding issues, not systematic issues. WFP is continuing to call for more donor funding to sustain the daily food effort in Dadaab and the rest of the region."

Turkey’s ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) won nearly 50 percent of the vote in Sunday’s parliamentary elections — its best showing since coming to power in 2002 — but now must handle redrafting the constitution and dealing with refugees flowing in from neighboring Syria.
The ruling party landed 326 out of 550 seats, just short of the 330 needed to call a referendum to rewrite the constitution. Erdogan must now bring opposition parties on board to get the charter through parliament. Many Turks agree that their constitution — written in 1982 under a military government — needs updating.
Erdogan’s party has received criticism for seeking to consolidate power more than trying to build a consensus with other parties. But the prime minister struck a conciliatory tone during his victory speech Sunday night, saying he would work with opposition parties on holding a public referendum on a new constitution, Al Jazeera reported.
“The problem with Turkish politics is that you do have a tendency for political parties to be dominated by one person,” said Henri Barkey, a visiting scholar in the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace’s Middle East Program and a professor of international relations at Lehigh University.
“Erdogan is a successful politician. He won because the economy is doing well, people didn’t want to change horses in mid-race, and he knows how to appeal. And he built a formidable political machine.”
The new constitution poses Erdogan’s greatest challenge, Barkey continued, because of the importance placed on it and because expectations are high. The process of rewriting the constitution will take a long time, he added, but people want it.
Also in his victory speech, Erdogan said the win was not only for his party but for other Muslims and people in the Middle East as well. “Believe me, Sarajevo won today as much as Istanbul, Beirut won as much as Izmir, Damascus won as much as Ankara, Ramallah, Nablus, Jenin, the West Bank, Jerusalem won as much as Diyarbakir,” he said.
People had been saying since the launch of the Arab Spring and the economic and political upheaval in the region that Turkey would have to re-evaluate its foreign policy, but Erdogan’s speech was meant to send the message that Turkey is still a regional player and would continue to actively engage in the region, according to Barkey.
But the region’s instability is now impacting Turkey directly, with thousands of Syrians having fled to Turkey to escape the fighting in their country between anti-government protesters and forces loyal to Syrian President Bashar Assad.
For Turkey, that was a game-changer, said Barkey. Turkey gets along with all neighboring governments, but Syria in particular was a showcase of Turkish foreign policy, he explained. And for a long time, Turks had hoped that Assad would reform — Erdogan has spoken to Assad directly about it and sent his intelligence chief and foreign minister to try to convince him to introduce reforms — but Assad has spurned him, Barkey noted.
According to Barkey, Syria made a tactical error by going after the town on the Turkish border and causing the exodus of its residents to Turkey, which essentially forced Turkey to take a position.
Erdogan last week accused the Assad government of “savagery” and said he would approach the Syrian government “very differently” after the Turkish elections.
And Turkey, which at one time gave Assad critical support and legitimacy when he felt Syria was encircled by the U.S. and other Western allies, now might move closer to the West on Syria because there appears to be no solution and all indications point to the situation getting worse, Barkey said.

Superbug Found in New Delhi Water
A drug-resistant superbug was found in about a quarter of samples taken from tap water and puddles in New Delhi, indicating the bacteria is circulating widely in the area.
Researchers from Cardiff University found the NDM-1 bacteria in two drinking water samples and 51 street samples, out of 200 total samples. The bacteria can be deadly and can only be treated with a few last-line, expensive antibiotics.
The World Health Organization called Thursday for new focus on preventing the spread of emerging drug-resistant bacteria threats.
Fleeing Ivory Coast Violence
As fighting continues in Ivory Coast between forces loyal to the internationally recognized winner of November’s presidential election, Alassane Ouattara, and the country’s incumbent leader Laurent Gbagbo, thousands are fleeing their home or heading for eastern Liberia.
The U.N.’s refugee agency reports an estimated 100,000 people are displaced within the country, while 135,000 may have already fled to Liberia.
Search for Bodies in Japan Evacuation Zone
The search for those missing after the March tsunami is extending into the evacuation zone around the Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear plant. Nearly 15,000 people are still listed as missing, but teams were told not to enter the 12-mile radius evacuation zone during previous searches.
Radiation levels have dropped low enough to safely send in police officers wearing protective suits, said the Fukushima Prefecture police.
Australia Pushes Toughest Anti-Smoking Laws Yet
Legislation proposed in Australia Thursday would require cigarette manufacturers to use only plain olive green packaging, without logos, featuring grotesque pictures warning of the health effects of tobacco. Olive green was found to be the most off-putting for smokers.
The country’s Minister for Health and Ageing Nicola Roxon said the laws would be a first and some of the toughest anti-smoking restrictions in the world, though tobacco companies claim it would infringe on trademark and intellectual property laws.
Food Prices Dip
World food prices declined in March for the first time in eight months, the U.N.’s Food and Agriculture Organization said Thursday, but still remain well above last year.
The FAO’s food price index showed a 2.9 percent drop from the record high food prices recorded in February that prompted new fears about food shortages and riots. Despite the drop, prices are 37 percent above March of last year and the FAO warns with harvest production uncertain, all the factors that led to the historic rise in prices are still in play."

This is one story among hundreds of thousands.
_pap_embed_custom('news01s431dqf59',482,304,"""");
In August, I visited my family in Syria and Jordan, where they have been residing since they fled Iraq in 2007 after a series of threats and losses of loved ones. A few months earlier, I was awarded a Fulbright scholarship and had moved to New York City where I was later granted asylum.
In my last weekend in Syria, a group of young Iraqi men suggested we go to a party at a night club on the outskirts of Damascus. One of my companions said to me: “Here you’ll find the most beautiful Iraqi refugee women … and they are very affordable.”
As we walked in, the stage was packed with women wearing heavy make up and revealing clothes. An Iraqi singer was performing live and the surrounding tables were occupied mostly by Arab men from the wealthy Gulf States and surrounding countries. Alcohol was being served and smoking was permitted.
A couple of hours into the night, the singer stepped aside and men from the crowd started joining the women on stage. Two women approached our table, asking if they could join us. From their accents, we knew they were Iraqi. Once they realized we were Iraqi too, they started talking about Iraq, the war, President Bush, Iran, al-Qaida and their lives in Syria.
The two women were cousins: Ananas, a 34-year-old pharmacist, and Dunya, a 28-year-old poetess. Ananas first came to Syria in 2006 after her brother and father were shot dead by a U.S. military convoy while he was driving during curfew hours. “They were all I had. Once they were gone, my uncles were forcing me to marry my cousin. He was 21 years older than me and already married. I escaped two days before the wedding date, got on a bus and came to Syria,” she said.
As for Dunya, she got married at the age of 16. “My husband was killed by armed militiamen in our front yard. I saw it … I was looking from the kitchen window. They stormed into our house after and raped me. I didn’t try to resist because I didn’t want them to go upstairs and find my daughter and hurt her. She was only 9 at the time.” Dunya then fled to Syria with her daughter in 2007 and united with her cousin Ananas, who had already found her way into the sex industry.
When I asked about Dunya’s daughter, she said, “Her name is Tamara. She is doing alright now. Oh, she is right there in fact,” as she started waving at a young girl, now 11-years-old, with wavy hair and wearing make up.
Tamara was on the stage dancing and was occasionally joined by men to talk or dance with her. When I asked Dunya whether she worried about Tamara losing her innocence, her reply was: “Innocence? That is not something for our children. It may be for the children in America or Europe but not us. Tamara is going to grow up in a society that judges her, restricts her and takes advantage of her. Being innocent is only going to make it worse and turn her life harder.”
Dunya said she is willing to marry Tamara to a man who would look after her.
Displaced Iraqi women — once removed from the support system in their homeland — become easy prey for the sex industry. Home, tribe, community and extended family are what provided that support system, and without it they sometimes turn to prostitution for survival.
A Syrian security official, who asked not to be identified, said thousands of Iraqi women have faced arrest, jail and forced deportation after being charged with prostitution.
A few days after meeting Ananas and Dunya, I drove to Amman, Jordan, the host country of the second largest Iraqi refugee population, after Syria. During my two weeks in Amman, it became clear there was a class division within the Iraqi community.
Jordan, like neighboring Syria, admitted Iraqis as “guests” or “tourists” and did not grant them refugee status, as neither one of these countries ratified the 1951 U.N. convention on refugees. Jordan, however, has set up a system in which Iraqis are granted residency once they deposit $100,000 in special government accounts.
So while Jordan can be a safe haven for investors and businessmen, the high cost of living and lack of access to legal work have imposed serious financial challenges on the hundreds of thousands of Iraqi refugees living there today.
There also appeared to be two groups of Iraqi refugees: those who lost everything and have nothing left to return to in Iraq, and others who fear losing everything if they return. And for the hundreds of thousands of Iraqi families in Jordan and Syria, the uncertainty over their future is far from over.

“We believe there should be no impunity for the sexual and gender-based violence committed by so many — that there must be arrests and prosecutions and punishment,” she said during a press conference with Congolese Foreign Minister Alexis Thambwe Mwamba in the eastern city of Goma, according to the Associated Press.
Clinton visited Magunga Camp, where about 18,000 men, women and children fled to avoid fighting that has raged off and on for the past decade, killing more than 5 million people.
Congo has hailed a military operation against rebels groups a success, but the rebels targeted by the Congolese army and U.N. forces have killed hundreds of civilians in reprisal attacks and displaced thousands more, according to Reuters.
On Tuesday, residents of the camp told Clinton they were suffering from malnutrition, malaria, tuberculosis and diarrhea.
In addition, women and young boys and girls are susceptible to rape when they leave the camp to collect wood for cooking, the residents said.
The United Nations has recorded at least 200,000 cases of sexual violence against women and girls in the region since conflict erupted in 1996.
“We really want to return home, that’s why we are asking America to help stop the fighting,” said Chantale Mapendo, who lives in the camp, quoted the AP.
“That’s why I’m here,” Clinton replied. “I want you to be able to go home.”
She said Tuesday that the people of eastern Congo were still suffering from a “reign of violence” at the hands of rebel groups and the national army, which in January launched a U.N.-backed campaign to pacify the region, the AP reported.
Earlier in August, Human Rights Watch demanded that Congo crack down on sexual violence, which is often reportedly perpetrated by military generals and other top officers. It cited U.N. data showing that 7,703 cases of sexual violence by soldiers were reported last year.
Rights groups have called for a suspension of the operation, which has displaced some 800,000 people and left hundreds of civilians dead.
Clinton said the United States is “very concerned about the civilian casualties, both deaths and rapes and other injuries, from the military action.” But she also said the U.S. supported efforts to eliminate the threat from insurgents and said the U.S. wants the Congolese military professionalized to prevent abuses from the government, according to the AP.
Earlier in the day, Clinton sought to deliver a strong message to Congolese President Joseph Kabila when they met in a tent at a compound in Goma, on the shore of Lake Kivu. She said the United States will send a team of legal and financial and other technical experts to come up with specific recommendations for overcoming Congo’s problems with corruption. She said Kabila had accepted that offer, Reuters reported.
Clinton is in the DR Congo as part of an 11-day tour of Africa."

After a February peace deal collapsed, Taliban forces began expanding their control of the northwestern region. Pakistan sent the army into the valley in April to uproot the militants, forcing a civilian exodus that became one of the largest human migrations in recent years.
But while many refugees are eager to return home after spending months in government-run camps, security back home remains a concern.
Government officials say more than 1,700 militants and nearly 160 soldiers have been killed in the operation. But the leaders of the Taliban reportedly remain untouched and are believed to be hiding in Swat. There are fears that escaped militants could easily reemerge among the civilian population and reignite fighting.
“It was the security reason that forced us to leave our homes, and if it is still there when we go back then we will be forced to leave our homes again,” Mohammad Rehman, 36, in a camp in Charsadda, told the Wall Street Journal.
The government expects the three-phased repatriation to take up to two weeks. But the logistics of such a large-scale operation may be more than the Pakistani government can handle, say refugee advocates.
“The Pakistani government is sending people home far too early,” Kristele Younes, of Refugees International, told the Guardian. “Displaced people should be the ones to determine whether it is safe for them to return, and we fear the government is not providing them with clear and accurate information.”
Confusion over the terms of the government’s plan were evident Monday when thousands of refugees were turned back by the military because they did not yet have permission to return, according to media reports. Other refugees refused to go back unless they were given a promised 25,000 rupees ($306) in government aid.
In central Pakistan, meanwhile, an explosion destroyed a house used as a religious seminary, killing at least nine people, seven of them children. Police said they had evidence the home had been used as a meeting place for militants, though the cause of the blast is unknown."

High Commissioner for Refugees “has received disturbing reports that several camps for internally displaced people near the Nord-Kivu town of Rutshuru, 90 kilometres north of Goma, have been forcibly emptied, looted and burned,” spokesman Ron Redmond told journalists, the Agence France-Presse reported.
The region is now in rebel control and aid agencies have no access, the refugee agency said. Tens of thousands of people have been driven from their homes by recent fighting between Tutsi rebel forces and Conogolese soldiers. Aid groups are trying to reach an estimated 250,000 people affected by the fighting, reported the BBC.
The rebels, led by renegade Gen. Laurent Nkunda, fought their way to the provincial capital of Goma earlier this week before declaring a cease-fire Wednesday.
Despite the refugee camp reports, a spokesman for the International Red Cross said Thursday most of the rebels are respecting the cease-fire, CNN reported.
Nkunda, whose National Congress for the Defense of the People movement claims to be defending the Tutsi minority in eastern Congo, has criticized the Congolese government for not protecting Tutsis from Rwandan Hutu militia that escaped to Congo after helping perpetrate the 1994 Rwandan genocide.
The Congolese government has promised to stop Hutu forces from using territory in the country, but has not enforced that promise.
Neighboring Rwanda, meanwhile, has been accused of allowing Nkunda’s men to recruit in Rwanda and use its territory.
The top U.S. diplomat for Africa, Assistant Secretary of State Jendayi Frazer, is planning to meet with Congo’s president and other officials Thursday in an attempt to foster an end to the conflict.
The State Department has said she also has tentative plans to travel to Rwanda to meet with President Paul Kagame.
France’s Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner and his British counterpart David Miliband are also visiting both countries Thursday.
“The mission will have several goals,” Kouchner’s spokesman, Eric Chevallier, told reporters. “The first is to carry a clear political message from Europe to demand that the situation stabilizes and the different actors agree to talk to each other more.
“The second is to get an update on the situation of the civilian population. Europe has decided to make an important contribution to the humanitarian effort in Goma.”"

“It is better that they move to their homes where they are more stable,” a government official at one of the camps said, reported Reuters. “Here, they are relying on donations and it is not stable.”
The U.N. Children’s Fund said eight government camps set up for homeless in the Irrawaddy delta town of Bogalay have been cleared, but could not confirm widespread evacuations throughout the delta.
“The government is moving people unannounced,” Teh Tai Ring, a UNICEF official, told the Associated Press.
Authorities are “dumping people in the approximate location of the villages, basically with nothing,” Ring said. Some rations were given out, but people who lost their government identity cards were being denied aid, UNICEF said.
About 2.4 million people were left homeless by the May 2 cyclone that ravaged Myanmar’s delta region.
The refugee evictions come a day after government run media criticized foreign aid donors for demanding access to the disaster region, saying the “Myanmar people are capable enough of rising from such natural disasters.”
“The people from Irrawaddy can survive on self-reliance without chocolate bars donated by foreign countries,” the Kyemon newspaper said in an editorial.
The editorial also condemned donor pledges of aid for being too small. The government has said it needs $11 billion, while $150 million has been pledged.
Aid organizations like the International Red Cross have had difficulty getting permission to enter the country and provide aid directly. Myanmar is also keeping ships loaded with humanitarian supplies from the United States, France and Great Britain from entering the country’s waters, leaving them to wait offshore.
The United Nations says fewer than half of the affected cyclone victims have received any form of help from either the government or other aid groups.
“We certainly don’t endorse premature return to where there are no services, and any forced or coerced movement is completely unacceptable,” U.N. spokeswoman Amanda Pitt said in Bangkok, according to the AP."

According to the BBC, the police forces were searching for suspects in a bank robbery when militants from the Fatah al-Islam group retaliated and posted armed guards at the camp’s entrances. The police responded by calling the army for reinforcements.
Close to 50 combatants, soldiers and militants reportedly were killed during Sunday’s fighting, including one Fatah al-Islam member who was suspected for an unsuccessful plot to bomb passenger trains in Germany.
Palestinian officials claimed that the Lebanese military, which by Monday had amassed hundreds of troops, battle tanks and armored carriers, had killed nine civilians and injured more than 70 others. The fighting erupted despite an agreement between Lebanon and the Palestine Liberation Organization that Lebanon’s military has no authority or jurisdiction in the camps.
Abu Salim, a spokesman for Fatah-al Islam, threatened to increase attacks outside of the camp if the Lebanese army did not stop its assault.
“It’s a life-or-death battle,” Salim told the Associated Press. “Their aim is to wipe out Fatah al-Islam. We will respond and we know how to respond.”
Fatah al-Islam is believed to have around 200 armed soldiers inside the camp. The faction’s leader, Shaker al-Abssi, has said that he is inspired by al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden and trains his followers to plan attacks outside of Lebanon, including Iraq.
The group is suspected to have ties to both al-Qaida and Syria, but Lebanese national police commander, Maj. Gen. Ashraf Rifi, told the AP that the group was too minor to have ties with al-Qaida.
“Perhaps there are some deluded people among them, but they are not al-Qaida. This is imitation al-Qaida, a ‘Made in Syria’ one,” said Rifi, accusing the Syrian government of fomenting the violence in the camp, a charge Syria has denied.
In a lecture at Damascus University, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Moualem said, “We reject this organization. It does not serve the Palestinian cause and it is not after liberating Palestine.”
Meanwhile, an explosion in Beirut, in a parking lot in the mainly Sunni Muslim district of Verdun, wounded at least seven people on Monday, security sources and witnesses said, according to Reuters.
The bomb, which authorities said may have been placed under the car, set other cars ablaze and broke windows in surrounding buildings."

The Israeli army, which had deployed 30,000 troops into southern Lebanon to fight Hezbollah, plans to start handing over parts of the territory to U.N. troops within the next few days, Israeli officials and Western diplomats told Reuters.
The Lebanese army will begin moving in 15, 000 troops south of the Litani River on Thursday. Lebanese Defense Minister Elias al-Murr has said the army will not disarm Hezbollah soldiers in the south.
But the truce did not bring an end to all violence. Israeli soldiers shot five Hezbollah fighters in Lebanon on Tuesday and four Hezbollah mortar bombs landed near Israeli troops overnight.
As displaced villagers returned to their towns, they found leaflets dropped by the Israelis, warning of the danger of returning.
Israeli troops have left the Christian town of Marjayoun, the nearby town of Qlaiah and the village of Ghandouriyeh.
Officials believe that Israel’s quick withdrawal plans reflect concern that its ground troops are easy targets for Hezbollah rockets.
Hezbollah announced an aid and reconstruction plan Tuesday as part of a clean-up operation in the bombed-out suburbs of Beirut. Nasrallah issued a public statement saying, “Our brothers in the villages and towns and the cities as well, will take the initiative to contact the owners of these houses in order to provide aid directly and very quickly in order to begin the rebuilding of these houses as soon as possible.”
Meanwhile, Israeli officials continued to hail the weeks-long operation against Hezbollah as a success.
“They (Hezbollah) thought they will bring Israel on our knees. I don’t say it’s easy but we withstood it and we feel that we went out of it militarily in a good shape and politically in an even better one,” Israeli Deputy Prime Minister Shimon Peres told a news conference Tuesday.
At least 1,000 people in Lebanon and more than 150 Israelis were killed in weeks of fighting that ensued after Hezbollah guerillas kidnapped two Israeli soldiers on July 12."

World Food Program said that Sudanese security forces surrounded and removed some refugees from two camps near Nyala before dawn, while in a third camp Sudanese forces fired shots in the air and tear gas to disperse crowds.
The WFP fears the government may start forcing people from the camps back to their home villages, where there is less protection from militias known as Janjaweed that have been attacking towns, said WFP spokeswoman Christiane Berthiaume. Sudan’s government is accused of backing the Janjaweed in a campaign of violence — including rapes, killings and the burning of villages — to help put down a 19-month rebellion by non-Arab-African groups. The government denies backing the militias.
The WFP said it was forced to evacuate 88 aid workers from those areas due to deteriorating security conditions.
The camps in Golu, Zaleinge and Nertetie were closed off at 3 a.m. without any warning, and agencies have been denied access to the camps ever since, Berthiaume told the Associated Press.
At least 160,000 refugees in western Darfur cannot be reached by road “because of insecurity,” she added.
Violence has driven more than 1.5 million of Darfur’s people from their homes, and at least 70,000 have died, mostly through disease and hunger, in what the United Nations calls the world’s worst humanitarian crisis.
Barry Came, the WFP’s spokesman in Khartoum, told Reuters that tensions in the area had risen since African Union monitors reported that the rebel Sudan Liberation Army had taken 11 Arab civilians hostage near Zaleinge. The rebels have claimed Janjaweed ordered 30 ethnic Africans from a bus on Sunday and shot them to death, the AP reported.
The Sudanese government on Tuesday denied that any army or police forces were surrounding the camps, and blamed the rebels for any deteriorating security.
“There is no siege,” Sudanese Humanitarian Affairs Minister Ibrahim Hamid told the AP. “It is not true that the government was telling organizations to pull out of the area, and the areas are not besieged.”
Hamid said angry Arab tribesmen gathered in the area after the kidnapping of 18 of their men by Darfur rebels. “The African Union has been alerted and they said they would bring those abducted out of the mountainous areas of Zaleinge,” he said.
Foreign Minister Mustafa Osman Ismail told Reuters, “If there is any increase in insecurity it is because of rebel activities.”
Despite the ongoing tension, peace talks between the government and two rebel groups continued in the Nigerian capital, Abuja. African Union officials on Monday presented the final draft of a compromise security agreement, which the rebels have cautiously praised."

The raid on the Jabalya refugee camp began hours after a suicide bomber blew himself up on a bus crowded with high school students on Wednesday, killing at least 15 people and injuring dozens more in the first suicide bombing in Israel in two months. A 14-year-old American girl was among those killed.
Palestinian witnesses and medics told reporters that eight unarmed civilians were killed when an Israeli tank fired toward refugee camp residents crowding around a building set ablaze during the nine-hour incursion.
The Israeli military disputed the claim that it fired on a crowd of bystanders, however, saying that an explosive detonated inside a nearby building was responsible for the deaths. The military does acknowledge that it fired two tank shells during the raid — one early in the incursion and another at a man aiming a rocket powered grenade launcher at troops as they attempted to withdraw from the area.
An Israeli army officer who identified himself as Lt. Col. Moshe told the Associated Press that troops were at a major intersection in the camp when “from inside a store, a very large bomb was detonated at us. It was a very big bomb,” adding that he believed the explosion could have killed some people.
Witness Fadl Nadi told the AP that he noticed two gunmen firing on an Israeli tank near the burning building as firemen attempted to battle the blaze.
“From the direction of the tank, I saw a projectile flying past and … I saw a fireman flying in the air,” Nadi said.
Gaza hospitals were reportedly overwhelmed with the wounded, and Palestinian medical officials said five of the fatalities ranged in age from 13 to 16, according to Reuters.
“God help us, we are running out of medicine, we are running out of blood,” a doctor shouted, according to the news service.
The military said the target of Thursday’s Gaza raid was Abdel Karim Ziada, a member of the Islamic militant group Hamas. Soldiers reportedly found rifles, grenades, explosive devices and anti-tank missile launchers in Ziada’s home, which the troops destroyed after the search.
A senior member of the Hamas group, which has claimed responsibility for a wave of suicide attacks on Israelis, vowed revenge.
“The Jews will pay a dear price,” Abdel-Aziz al-Rantissi told Reuters in Gaza.
Palestinian Cabinet minister Saeb Erekat condemned the army’s raid, calling it the “Israeli government’s revenge” for the bus bombing in Haifa.
“We hold the Israeli government fully responsible for such acts of revenge,” Erekat said. “We urge President Bush to reshift his focus from war on Iraq to helping the Palestinians and Israelis break this vicious cycle.”
Israeli forces sealed both the West Bank and the Gaza Strip in response to the bus bombing and banned most Palestinians from entering Israel.
Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon likened the ongoing violence to the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks in the United States.
“For years the world, including our closest allies, didn’t understand the danger of terror,” Sharon said in Jerusalem. “The terror that attacked the twin towers [Sept. 11] is the same terror that murders school children.”
White House spokesman Ari Fleischer said Thursday that President Bush was concerned over the deaths of innocent Palestinians in the Israeli raid.
“Israel suffered a terrible attack at the hands of terrorists at Haifa. Israel has a right to defend itself,” Fleischer said. “But the president reminds Israel about [his view that] any actions they take must be done with an eye toward protecting innocent Palestinians.”"

Troops also entered the West Bank city of Nablus but no arrests were made and troops withdrew after several hours according to Palestinian witnesses.
Causalities reported in the West Bank and Gaza Strip included a 7-year-old boy who was shot inside his home, an armed Palestinian who tried to enter an Israeli settlement and an Israeli Arab woman who was shot when assailants fired on her taxi.
The leader of the Islamic militant group Hamas, which has claimed responsibility for several of the recent suicide bombing attacks in Israel, vowed that his faction would not stop the attacks as long as Israeli forces continue raids on Palestinian cities and towns.
“All attacks will go on. You cannot talk about ceasing attacks while your enemy is pursuing its incursions and its killings of civilians everywhere,” Sheikh Ahmed Yassin told Reuters.
Meanwhile, Palestinian President Yasser Arafat cast doubt on his call earlier in the week for new elections, telling reporters that there would be no new vote until Israel ended its occupation of Palestinian territory.
Palestinian officials later clarified Arafat’s comments, saying Israel would have to withdraw to positions held before the latest outbreak of fighting began in September 2000. Such a withdrawal would require Israeli forces to remove several checkpoints and pull back troops positioned outside of Palestinian cities.
Arafat’s aides also said preparations have begun for presidential and parliamentary elections within six months.
Israeli officials dismissed Arafat’s demands, saying he is looking for an excuse not to face voters in a new round of elections."

Ambulances waited outside the camps to try to take the wounded to hospitals. Meanwhile in the tight camp alleyways, Israeli soldiers and Palestinian gunmen traded fire in what is being described as the most violent fighting since the current uprising began 17 months ago.
Israel has fired into Palestinian refugee camps in the past, but this is the first incursion of large numbers of troops.
The new Israeli tactic began on Thursday when helicopters and tanks battled their way into the Balata and Jenin camps, killing at least 11 Palestinians and one Israeli soldier.
According to Israeli officials, Palestinian militants have taken refuge in the camps, where overcrowded blocks and narrow streets provide protection from Israeli tanks.
In Balata, the largest refugee camp in the West Bank, 22,000 residents live in less than a third of a mile square. Israel officials say it is a command center for the Aksa Martyrs Brigades, a group linked to Palestinian leader Arafat’s Fatah Party that has claimed responsibilty for several attacks against Israelis.
Before the attack, the Israeli Army urged non-combatant residents of the Balata camp to flee. But the New York Times reported that few Balata residents appeared to leave, either because they had nowhere else to go, or because they did not want to leave their homes again.
“We were refugees already twice,” said Mahmoud Diyab, 80, who said he was pushed out of homes in the 1967 war as well as in 1948.
Responding to the Israeli attacks, Palestinian Authority President Yasir Arafat called on the international community to intervene in what he described as a massacre.
“I call upon the whole world to act quickly before a state of chaos engulfs the whole Middle East region,” Mr. Arafat told reporters.
Palestinian officials said the raids were timed to undermine a Saudi peace proposal that has gained praise from Arabs and some Israeli officials. U.S. officials, including George Tenet, the director of central intelligence, were in Saudi Arabia Thursday discussing the plan with its author, Crown Prince Abdullah.
Under the Saudi proposal, Arab countries would recognize the state of Israel in exchange for a withdrawal from territories Israel occupied during the 1967 Mideast war.
Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon has not commented directly on the Saudi plan, which does not address some of the most contentious issues such as the right of return for Palestinian refugees and the fate of Jerusalem.
However the proposal has been rejected by far-right members of Sharon’s cabinet.
From the Israeli left, Israeli opposition leader Yossi Sarid called the refugee camp attacks “total craziness,” and urged Mr. Sharon to withdraw Israeli forces from the camps.
“This is a new phase in the war for the safety of the settlements,” he said.
The U.S. has said it was “especially concerned” about the move on refugee camps, but maintained that Israel has a right to defend itself.
However “every effort should be made to avoid harm to civilians,” said State Department spokesman Richard Boucher.
Since renewed fighting began in September 2000, 1,015 Palestinians have died as have 288 Israelis."
https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/middle_east-jan-june02-mideast_02-28,refugee,398,2002-02-28T18:15:00-05:00,None,Israeli Forces Attack West Bank Refugee Camps,"Eleven Palestinians and an Israeli soldier were killed in gunbattles near the West Bank towns of Nablus and Jenin.
As evening fell, Israel was in control of several buildings in the Balata refugee camp.
“The camp is effectively under [Israeli military] control,” said Israeli Col. Avi Cohavi, head of the paratrooper brigade carrying out the operation. “It’s completely surrounded and we are in commanding positions.”
Israel said the operation, which included helicopter gunships and tanks was intended to show “there is no refuge for terror.”
According to Israeli officials, Palestinian militants have taken refuge in the camps, where overcrowded blocks and narrow streets provide protection from Israeli tanks.
Nasser Awais, a leader of the Al Aqsa Brigades, which is linked to Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat’s Fatah movement and four recent attacks on Israelis, was hiding in the Balata camp, according to Israeli authorities.
Israeli soldiers went house-to-house looking for Palestinian militiamen, but there were no reports of surrenders. Palestinian officials reported that almost 100 Palestinians have been injured, most of them gunmen.
The U.S. said it was “especially concerned” about the move on refugee camps, but maintained that Israel has a right to defend itself.
“Every effort should be made to avoid harm to civilians,” said State Department spokesman Richard Boucher.
Israel has gone into Palestinian towns during the last 17 months, but Thursday’s incursion marks the first time large numbers of troops have taken up positions in the camps.
The development comes the day after Saudi Arabia presented its peace initiative to the United Nations.
Under the Saudi proposal, Arab countries would recognize the state of Israel in exchange for a withdrawal from territories Israel occupied during the 1967 Mideast war.
However Thursday’s fighting struck a blow to international efforts to arrange a ceasefire.
Ahmed Abdel Rahman, an adviser to Palestinian Authority President Arafat, accused Israel of trying to destroy any movement towards peace.
Rahman did not say whether the militants were in the camps, but said, “We cannot prevent the Palestinians from defending themselves and their land as long as there is occupation.”
Israeli Defense Minister Binyamin Ben-Eliezer said Israel will leave when that goal of stopping the current wave of suicide attacks is accomplished.
“We don’t intend to stay there. We intend to go in and get out,” Ben-Eliezer said.
Since renewed fighting began in September 2000, 1,009 Palestinians have died as have 288 Israelis."

He’s tweeted anti-immigrant ads and threatened to revoke birthright citizenship, something lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have said would be unconstitutional, as he campaigns to drive up Republican turnout.
In a Thursday speech, Trump, a vocal critic of illegal immigration long before he reached the White House, claimed it costs the U.S. billions of dollars each year.
“Illegal immigration hurts Americans workers, burdens American taxpayers and undermines public safety, and places enormous strains on local schools, hospitals and communities in general, taking precious resources away from the poorest Americans who need them most,” Trump said.
While Trump’s rhetoric has lately focused on unauthorized immigrants, his policies have targeted legal immigration as well. Under his administration, refugee admissions in 2017 dropped to their lowest since at least 2002. Trump signed an executive order tightening restrictions on HB1 visas for skilled immigrants. He has pushed for a merit-based immigration system, and his administration has proposed cutting public benefits to legal immigrants.
Trump’s characterization of immigrants, as people who drain public resources, however, is not backed by the data. Unauthorized immigrants aren’t usually eligible for federal benefits, for instance, and multiple studies have found that immigrants help the economy grow.
Here are some of the most widespread myths about how immigrants affect the U.S. economy, and the research that refutes them.
Myth #1: Immigrants take more from the U.S. government than they contribute
Fact: Immigrants contribute more in tax revenue than they take in government benefits
A 2017 report from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine found immigration “has an overall positive impact on the long-run economic growth in the U.S.”
How that breaks down is important.
First-generation immigrants cost the government more than native-born Americans, according to the report — about $1,600 per person annually. But second generation immigrants are “among the strongest fiscal and economic contributors in the U.S.,” the report found. They contribute about $1,700 per person per year. All other native-born Americans, including third generation immigrants, contribute $1,300 per year on average.

It is difficult to determine the exact cost or contribution of unauthorized immigrants because they are harder to survey, but the study suggests they likely have a more positive effect than their legal counterparts because they are, on average, younger and do not qualify for public benefits.
It’s also important to note that less-educated immigrants tend to work more than people with the same level of education born in the U.S. About half of all U.S.-born Americans with no high school diploma work, compared to about 70 percent of immigrants with the same education level, Giovanni Peri, an economics professor at the University of California, Davis, said in a recent interview with PBS NewsHour.
WATCH:Proposed immigration policy penalizes legal residents for use of public benefits
In general, more people working means more taxes — and that’s true overall with undocumented immigrants as well. Undocumented immigrants pay an estimated $11.6 billion a year in taxes, according to the Institute on Taxation & Economic Policy.
Immigrants are also less likely to take public benefits than the native-born population for two reasons.
First, to receive most public benefits under the social safety net, immigrants must be lawful permanent residents for at least five years.
There are approximately 9 million immigrants that fit that definition in the U.S. Of those, many would not qualify for welfare or other programs because their incomes are too high.
“While it is really important to ensure that immigrants and their children have access to the safety net, there are already a lot of eligibility barriers in place,” said Hamutal Bernstein, a senior research associate at the Urban Institute.
Many immigrants are hesitant to take public benefits even if they are eligible, Peri said.
“There is a little bit of a stigma in applying for welfare because they have come here to work, to support their families,” Peri said.
Immigrants can be a financial burden to state and local governments through the cost of sending their children to public school — something Trump mentioned Thursday.
But Trump’s claim ignored a critical point. Educating those children has economic benefits later down the road when they get better-paying jobs and, in turn, pay higher taxes.
Myth #2: Immigrants take American jobs
Fact: Immigrants workers often take jobs that boost other parts of the economy
Immigrants make up 17 percent of the U.S. labor force, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, but few experts believe they’re taking jobs from Americans, as Trump claims.
“Most economists agree that in spite of being a very big part of the labor force, immigrants have not come at the cost either of American jobs, nor of American wages,” Peri, the UC Davis professor, said.
The reason is that immigrants often have jobs that Americans tend not to take. So instead of competing with Americans’ for work, immigrants tend to complement American workers.

On a farm, for example, owners, managers and salespeople are often born in America. Immigrants tend to work as field hands. Neither group could do their job without the other.
Immigrants who work as child care providers give Americans, specifically women, more opportunity to join the labor force. And immigrants are playing an increasingly critical role in taking care of the elderly as baby boomers retire. Census data shows that immigrants accounted for 24 percent of nursing, psychiatric and home care aides in 2015.
A study from the bipartisan research organization New American Economy found immigrants were 15 percent more likely to work unusual hours than similar U.S.-born workers. They are also more likely to be employed in dangerous jobs, according to data from the American Community Survey and Bureau of Statistics.
In addition, the latest jobs report shows the U.S. economy performing strongly enough that it can absorb large numbers of workers, including immigrants.
Immigrants fill those roles in part because they are on average less educated than native-born Americans. About 26 percent have less than a high school degree, compared to 5 percent of native-born workers, according to the Urban Institute. But one in three immigrant workers have a college or advanced degree, a rate on par with Americans born here. Unauthorized immigrants tend to have slightly lower education levels; about 13 percent have college degrees.
Myth #3: The U.S. economy does not need immigrants
Fact: Immigrants are key to offsetting a falling birth rate
The U.S. birth rate is 1.8 births per woman, down from 3.65 in 1960, according to the World Bank. Demographers consider 2.1 births per woman as the rate needed to replace the existing population.
According to the Pew Research Center, if not for immigrants, the U.S. workforce would be shrinking. That would create a host of problems for the federal government.
Social Security, which is paid for by current workers, would be in even more serious budgetary trouble than it already is. Economic growth would also likely stagnate or even contract, as it has in Japan, a country where the population is shrinking and does not attract many immigrants.
Automation can buttress economic growth for a while, but investment in new technology only goes so far, said Betsey Stevenson, an associate professor of economics at the University of Michigan.
Plus, immigrants increase demand for goods and services, which further boosts economic growth, she added.
Myth #4: It would be better for the economy if immigrants’ children were not citizens
Fact: Children with citizenship are more productive workers
At his rally Thursday night in Columbia, Missouri, Trump criticized the 14th Amendment, which was ratified after the Civil War and guaranteed citizenship to “all persons born or naturalized in the United States,” including people who were formerly enslaved.
Trump said the idea was “a crazy, lunatic policy” supported by Democrats that today allows “hundreds of thousands of children born to illegal immigrants” to become citizens each year.

Research shows that repealing birthright citizenship could have significant negative consequences for the U.S. economy because children who are citizens have more economic opportunity and rely less on government assistance.
A Migration Policy Institute analysis estimates the number of unauthorized immigrants would increase from 11 million to 16 million by 2050 if birthright citizenship were repealed.
“Over the course of decades, you’d end up with a growing population that is cut off from the rest of society because they live in fear of deportation and they can’t get jobs,” said Randy Capps, the director of research for U.S. programs at the Migration Policy Institute.
Take, for example, the population of so-called “Dreamers” who were brought to the U.S. illegally as children. One study estimated the U.S. is losing out on $15 billion in economic potential from that group because they often face problems getting into college and getting a job.
An experiment in Germany, which does not have birthright citizenship, also showed that when children of immigrants were given citizenship at birth, those children experienced better health outcomes and had fewer children of their own."
https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/pittsburgh-synagogue-shooting-suspect-due-in-court-thursday,refugee,497,2018-11-01T10:43:25-04:00,"Maryclaire Dale, Associated Press",Pittsburgh synagogue shooting suspect pleads not guilty,"PITTSBURGH — The anti-Semitic truck driver accused of gunning down 11 people at a Pittsburgh synagogue pleaded not guilty on Thursday to federal charges that could put him on death row.
Robert Bowers, 46, was arraigned one day after a grand jury issued a 44-count indictment that charges him with murder, hate crimes, obstructing the practice of religion and other crimes. It was his second brief appearance in a federal courtroom since the weekend massacre at Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh’s Squirrel Hill neighborhood.
“Yes!” Bowers said in a loud voice when asked if he understood the charges.
Authorities say Bowers raged against Jews during and after the deadliest anti-Semitic attack in American history.
Bowers, who was shot and wounded during a gun battle that injured four police officers, walked into court under his own power, his left arm heavily bandaged. He was in a wheelchair at his first court appearance on Monday.
Bowers, who is stocky and square-faced with salt-and-pepper, closely cropped hair, frowned as the charges were read but did not appear to have a reaction as a federal prosecutor announced he could face a death sentence. He told a prosecutor he had read the indictment.
One of his federal public defenders, Michael Novara, said Bowers pleaded not guilty, “as is typical at this stage of the proceeding.”
Bowers had been set for a preliminary hearing on the evidence, but federal prosecutors instead took the case to a grand jury.
The panel issued the indictment as funerals continued for the victims.
Jared Younger of Los Angeles told mourners that he waited for hours Saturday for his father to pick up his phone or let them know he was all right. The dread built all day until his sister learned their father, Irving Younger, had indeed been shot and killed.
“That waiting stage was just unbearable,” Jared Younger said at his father’s funeral Wednesday. “Saturday was the most lonely day of my life.”
Funerals were planned Thursday for Bernice and Sylvan Simon, husband and wife, and Dr. Richard Gottfried, a dentist who worked part-time at a clinic treating refugees and immigrants. The oldest victim, 97-year-old Rose Mallinger, will be honored at a service Friday. Her daughter was injured in the attack.
Friends recalled Irving Younger, 69, as a “kibbitzing, people-loving” man. He was one of the first people Rabbi Jeffrey Myers met when he came to town last year from New Jersey to lead Tree of Life.
Myers, who survived the massacre, is presiding over five funerals for seven congregants this week. He ran a few minutes late to Younger’s service because he was still at the burial for another victim, Joyce Fienberg.
“I can’t imagine the stress he’s under,” said his predecessor, Rabbi Charles “Chuck” Diamond.
As Younger’s service was wrapping up, Myers momentarily forgot to read a letter to the family that another rabbi had sent.
“After preparing for five funerals, you get a little verklempt,” Myers said.
Bowers remained jailed without bail."

There, they found evidence of the Robert D. Bowers’ extreme anti-Semitic and xenophobic views. To people who study extremism, it was a sign of a disturbing trend.
“We are living in a moment where anti-Semitism is almost becoming normalized, and that should shock and move all of us to act,” said Jonathan Greenblatt, CEO of the Anti-Defamation League, which has been tracking incidents targeting the Jewish community for decades.
In its annual report, the Anti-Defamation League documented a 57 percent rise in anti-Semitic incidents in the United States in 2017. The group says this represented the largest increase — 1,986 incidents — in a single year since it began collecting data in 1979. The only other year on record that compares was 1994, when the ADL documented a record 2,066 anti-Semitic incidents of harassment, vandalism and assault.
Anti-semitism has “moved from the margins into the mainstream,” Greenblatt told Meet the Press.
The shooting also comes amid a growing worry over far-right extremism.
A 2017 report from the Government Accountability Office found that since the 9/11 attacks, far-right extremists were responsible for three times as many attacks as Islamic extremists, 62 incidents compared with 23. Islamic extremist attacks have killed more people — 119, compared with the 106 tied to far-right extremists.
Here’s a look at how anti-Semitism and other hateful rhetoric can translate to the violence seen the past week and what can be done to stop it.

The role social media has played in spreading racist, anti-Semitic conspiratorial content has “exploded” in recent years, said Keegan Hankes, a senior research analyst for the Southern Poverty Law Center’s Intelligence Project.
Facebook and Twitter have made efforts to quell anti-Semitism and other hateful language on their platforms, but have done so inconsistently. There’s also a distinction between how anti-Semitism flourishes in places like Facebook and Twitter and on less restricted platforms like 4Chan and Gab, among others, Hankes said.
Hate group leaders can use these digital spaces as “megaphones for their poisonous ideologies,” Hankes said, but it’s done differently depending on the platform. On Facebook and Twitter, hate groups can reach an audience that’s not just extremists and may or may not be susceptible to their messages, whereas on Gab or 4Chan, there can be a much more concentrated hub of extremists that’s used to “drive people even further down this radicalization path,” he added.
But how could hateful rhetoric then translate into violence like the Tree of Life shooting?
“You see people who maybe hold extreme positions or some racist positions spend a long of time steeping and kind of cultivating grievances,” Hankes said, adding there’s a phrase for this: wound collection.
“Once they get this idea in their head about this plight they’re suffering from, they start collecting more and more “wounds,” or anger, toward the perceived cause of those problems. And ultimately you see some people go out and act on them,” Hankes said.
In a final posting on Gab, the Pittsburgh shooting suspect said he couldn’t “sit by and watch my people get slaughtered.”
The Pittsburgh shooting occurred in a week in which two other major crimes captured national attention. Florida resident Cesar Sayoc faces federal charges for mailing 14 suspicious packages to Democratic leaders and critics of President Donald Trump, and a shooting at a Kroger store in Kentucky left two black people dead is being investigated as a hate crime.
The Twitter account belonging to the Sayoc was filled with anti-Semitic conspiracy theories, while in the Kentucky case, the suspect, who is white, told a white bystander that, “Whites don’t kill whites,” according to the son of a witness.
And in Bowers’ final posting on Gab, he railed against the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society (HIAS), a Jewish organization that helps the federal government resettle refugees in U.S. homes. The Pittsburgh shooting is believed to be the deadliest U.S. attack on a Jewish community.
Bowers also reportedly made several posts directed at the Central American caravan on his now-deleted social media account. In racist overtones, he described the thousands of migrants as “invaders.” He also blamed Jews for helping the caravan.
One recent conspiracy theory blames liberal philanthropist George Soros, who is also a Holocaust survivor, for funding the caravan. In another recent conspiracy theory, Soros was accused of paying people to protest Brett Kavanaugh’s Supreme Court nomination, something Trump himself advanced on his Twitter account.
Conspiracy theories like those around Soros also play a huge role in radicalization, Hankes said.
“It’s kind of one of those genres of content that really sows distrust and suspicion and makes people more amenable to these racist positions that we see people in organized hate groups espousing,” he said.
These theories cast Soros as “some Jewish puppet master pulling the strings of society in a way that’s unfavorable to white men,” Hankes added. “It’s ridiculous, but it’s something that you see people kind of embrace and point to.”
These theories play into this victimization culture, Hankes said, and makes it easier for someone to say, “Look, the system is rigged against me. I am the victim here.” This is how “out-there beliefs” can get channeled into someone’s ideology, he said.

Citing the ADL’s numbers on the recent uptick of anti-Semitic incidents, Greenblatt warned that anti-Semitism was in danger of “almost becoming normalized.”
Chiraag Bains, who served for about seven years in the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division, told the NewsHour that there are many ways these radical ideologies can be normalized.
One of the ways is when violence occurs and the government and high-ranking officials don’t do enough to condemn those acts, said Bains, who served under former President Barack Obama.
Trump did condemn the Pittsburgh shooting as a “wicked act of mass murder.” Attorney General Jeff Sessions, too, said the killings were “reprehensible and utterly repugnant,” adding that the DOJ intended to file hate crime charges against the suspect.
Following the Pittsburgh shooting, Sessions and Trump “said the right thing,” Bains said, “but those remarks are ineffectual in the broader context of what the president has been saying and doing.”
Bains said Trump and his administration has “failed to consistently condemn bigotry.” Hate crimes, he said, are not just attacks on individuals, they’re attacks on communities.
During an appearance in Boston, Sessions said the Pittsburgh shooting “was not just an attack on the Jewish faith,” adding that it was “an attack on all people of faith, an attack on America’s values. It cannot and will not be tolerated.”
That statement, as one critic pointed out, appeared to minimize the anti-Semitic nature of the crime.
The president’s comments and policy choices have emboldened people with racist ideas, Bains said. They “may in fact encourage people to hold those views and act on them,” he said.
Vanita Gupta, former head of the Civil Rights Division at the Department of Justice, said white nationalists are being emboldened by the country’s highest office. She pointed to Trump calling Mexican immigrants “rapists” and “criminals” at the start of his presidential campaign in 2016, as well as his failure to denounce white supremacists and their violent rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, last year.
“Hate has always been a feature of this country’s history,” said Gupta, who’s now the president and CEO of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights. “It’s just that, for a time, there was a sense that it was in the fringes. But what we’re seeing now is just an emboldening of these forces in communities around the country and in disturbing ways,” she added.
White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders bristled at the notion earlier this week that the president’s words were in any way connected to incidents like the Pittsburgh attack.
“You can’t start putting the responsibility of individuals on anybody but the individual who carries out the crime. … The president is not responsible for these acts,” Sanders said in the first White House briefing since the Pittsburgh shooting.
Trump, too, has placed the blame over division in the U.S. squarely with the media. On Monday, he tweeted that the “Fake News Media” is “the true Enemy of the People.” It’s a refrain he’s often used against journalists and one that’s been heightened ahead of the Nov. 6 midterm elections.
Sanders defended Trump telling reporters that the president wasn’t referring to every media outlet as the “enemy of the people,” but instead was concerned about the “growing amount of fake news that exists in the country.”
Earlier this week, after the Pittsburgh shooting, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein said the DOJ was launching a new website that would help consolidate information on reporting hate crimes.
“Crimes motivated by racial, ethnic, sexual or religious animus carry a particularly vile moral quality, but because they are defined, recorded and investigated differently across states, we do not fully comprehend their impact on public safety,” U.S. Attorney Matt M. Dummermuth said in a statement.
The DOJ also announced a $840,000 grant for the University of New Hampshire to launch a national survey of hate crime incidents, including an analysis on how incidents are reported, investigated and prosecuted locally. The study, expected to run through 2021, will survey 3,000 law enforcement agencies and 250 prosecutors across the country.
Overall, hate crime data is underreported. The FBI relies on local law enforcement for that data, but many agencies do not provide reports. ProPublica reported last year that among the thousands of agencies that do, about 88 percent said there were no hate crimes in 2016.
“The evidence suggests that many police agencies across the country are not working very hard to count hate crimes,” ProPublica reported.
ADL also listed dozens of U.S. cities that reported zero hate crimes or chose not to submit their reports in 2016.
More information about hate crimes would allow officials and communities to better counter the problem, multiple experts told the NewsHour.
Gupta said there have also been other attempts to get better data on hate crimes. The Communities Against Hate initiative was launched shortly after the 2016 election when civil rights organizations warned of a rise in hate-related incidents.
She added that combating this hate is an “all-hands-on-deck” effort that involves local community organizations coming together to promote values of inclusion and diversity, and more collaboration on the law enforcement level to gain the community’s trust when hate crimes occur.
“It’s not about one person occupying the White House,” Gupta said. “It’s a bigger effort.”
When asked about its work on combating hate crimes, a DOJ spokesperson pointed to several of the agency’s prosecutions in recent months, including the man found guilty in July of a hate crime in the 2017 burning of a Texas mosque and the September indictment of a Wisconsin man of a hate crime for mailing threats to Jewish community center.
Bains said that hate crime prosecutions have continued under the Trump administration, but it hasn’t had the same level of priority as in the prior administration.
Bains pointed to how the DOJ will prosecute the murder of transgender teen yet also try to limit certain civil rights for trans Americans across the country.
“The question of civil rights is a lesser priority for this administration,” Bains said."
https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/what-the-u-s-troops-deployed-to-the-u-s-mexico-border-can-and-cant-do,refugee,1079,2018-10-30T19:03:32-04:00,"Astrid Galvan, Associated Press",What the U.S. troops deployed to the U.S.-Mexico border can and can’t do,"PHOENIX — The more than 5,200 active-duty troops being sent by President Donald Trump to the U.S.-Mexico border will be limited in what they can do under a federal law that restricts the military from engaging in law enforcement on American soil.
That means the troops will not be allowed to detain immigrants, seize drugs from smugglers or have any direct involvement in stopping a migrant caravan that is still about 1,000 miles from the nearest border crossing.
Instead, their role will largely mirror that of the existing National Guard troops — about 2,000 in all — deployed to the border over the past six months, including providing helicopter support for border missions, installing concrete barriers and repairing and maintaining vehicles. The new troops will include military police, combat engineers and helicopter companies equipped with advanced technology to help detect people at night.
The extraordinary military operation comes a week before the Nov. 6 midterm elections as Trump has sought to transform fears about the caravan and immigration into electoral gains. On Tuesday, he stepped up his dire warnings, calling the band of migrants fleeing poverty and violence in Central America an “invasion.”
“Our Military is waiting for you!” he tweeted.
R. Gil Kerlikowske, Customs and Border Protection commissioner from 2014 to 2017, said the military cannot stop asylum seekers who show up at border crossings to seek protection, and that Border Patrol agents have had no trouble apprehending people who cross illegally.
“I see it as a political stunt and a waste of military resources and waste of tax dollars,” said Kerlikowske, who was at the helm during a major surge of Central Americans migrants in 2014. “To use active-duty military and put them in that role, I think is a huge mistake. I see it as nothing more than pandering to the midterm elections by the president.”
Traveling mostly on foot, the caravan of some 4,000 migrants and a much smaller group of hundreds more are still weeks, if not months, before reaching the U.S. border. Thousands have already dropped out, applying for refugee status in Mexico or taking the Mexican government up on free bus rides back home, and the group is likely to dwindle even more during the arduous journey ahead.
Another smaller caravan earlier this year numbered only a couple hundred by the time it arrived at the Tijuana-San Diego crossing.

And despite the heightened rhetoric, the number of immigrants apprehended at the border is dramatically lower than past years. Border Patrol agents this year made only a quarter of the arrests they made in 2000 at the height of illegal immigration, when the agency had half of the staffing it does today. The demographics have also drastically changed, from mostly Mexican men traveling alone, to Central American families with children.
Migrants arriving at the border will now see a sizable U.S. military presence — more than double the 2,000 who are in Syria fighting the Islamic State group — even though their mission will be largely a support role.
That’s because the military is bound by the Posse Comitatus Act, a 19th- century federal law that restricts participation in law enforcement activities. Unless Congress specifically authorizes it, military personnel can’t have direct contact with civilians, including immigrants, said Scott R. Anderson of The Brookings Institution.
Air Force Gen. Terrence O’Shaughnessy, head of U.S. Northern Command, said Tuesday that at least 5,239 troops were being sent to the Southwest border as the Pentagon works to meet requests from the Department of Homeland Security.
“The 5,239 are going forward and there will be additional forces over and above the 5,239,” he said, adding that number “is not the top line.”
Asked about the use of weapons, O’Shaughnessy said the active-duty troops have been given clear guidance on the use of force and there will be unit and individual training to make sure they know what they can and can’t do. Generally, U.S. troops are authorized to use force in self-defense.
Still, the large troop deployment will be limited to performing similar support functions as the National Guard troops Trump has already sent to the border.
These include 1,500 flight hours logged by about 600 National Guard troops in Arizona since they were deployed this spring. Members of the guard have also repaired more than 1,000 Border Patrol vehicles and completed 1,000 hours of supply and inventory, according to Customs and Border Protection.
In one case, a group of Border Patrol agents tracking drug smugglers in the remote Arizona desert in August called on a National Guard helicopter to keep an eye on the suspects and guide agents on the ground until they had them in custody. That operation resulted in several arrests and the seizure of 465 pounds of marijuana.
O’Shaughnessy said there were about 1,000 troops already in Texas and that will grow to at least 1,800, likely by Wednesday. The deployments to Arizona and California will follow. All are going to staging bases in the states, and there are none at the border yet, he said.
It remains unclear why the administration was choosing to send active-duty troops given that they will be limited to performing the support functions the Guard already is doing.
The California National Guard has pledged up to 400 troops to the president’s border mission through March 31. Jerry Brown, the only Democratic governor in the four states bordering Mexico and a frequent Trump critic, conditioned his support on the troops having nothing to do with immigration enforcement or building border barriers.
Brown said the California troops would help fight transnational criminal gangs and drug and firearms smugglers.
In New Mexico, 118 Guard troops have been helping with vehicle maintenance and repair, cargo inspection operations, surveillance and communications.
Texas Gov. Greg Abbott pledged 400 troops to the border in April. Maj. Gen. John Nichols, the head of the Texas National Guard, told Congress in July that his troops served in a “variety of support roles,” including driving vehicles, security monitoring, and administration.

President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump paid solemn tribute Tuesday to each of the 11 people slain in the worst instance of anti-Semitic violence in American history. As the Trumps placed their remembrances outside the Tree of Life synagogue, protesters nearby shouted that the president was not welcome.
The Trumps first went inside the vestibule of the synagogue, where they lit candles for each victim before stepping outside. It was a marker of the political divisions roiling the nation in the aftermath of the Sabbath shooting that shouts of “Words matter!” and “Trump, go home!” could be heard from demonstrators gathered not far from where a gunman had opened fire on Saturday.
Rabbi Jeffrey Myers, who had been conducting services when the shots rang out, led the first couple outside and gestured at white Jewish stars posted for each victim. At each, the president placed a stone, a Jewish burial tradition, while the first lady added a flower. They were trailed by first daughter Ivanka Trump and son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who are Jewish.
Trump stepped into the role of national consoler, a title he wears uncomfortably, as he arrived in Squirrel Hill, the neighborhood where he faced an uneasy welcome. Flowers, candles and chalk drawings filled the nearby corner, including a small rock painted with the number “6,000,011,” adding the victims this week to the estimated number of Jews killed in the Holocaust.
Squirrel Hill resident Paul Carberry, 55, said Trump should not have visited until the dead were buried, and he decried the president’s divisive rhetoric.
“He didn’t pull the trigger, but his verbiage and actions don’t help,” Carberry said. Hundreds of protesters assembled to show their displeasure with Trump’s presence.
When Air Force One touched down at the airport outside Pittsburgh, the Trumps were not greeted by the usual phalanx of local officials that typically welcomes a visiting president, a reflection of controversy surrounding the visit.
Local and religious leaders were divided on whether Trump should have come.

Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto, a Democrat, told reporters before the visit was announced that the White House ought to consult with the families of the victims about their preferences and asked that the president not come during a funeral. Neither he nor Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf planned to appear with Trump.
As his motorcade wound through downtown Pittsburgh, some onlookers saluted the president with upraised middle fingers and others with downturned thumbs. Scattered protest signs included messages
The White House invited the top four congressional leaders to join Trump in Pennsylvania, but none accompanied him.
A spokesman for Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said he already had events in his home state of Kentucky, pushing back on the suggestion that he declined. Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan’s office said he could not attend on short notice. Democratic Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and Democratic House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi also opted not to participate.
Questions have long swirled about the president’s credibility as a unifier. Since his 2016 Republican campaign for the White House, Trump has at times been slow to denounce white nationalists, neo-Nazis and other hate-filled individuals and groups that found common cause with his nationalistic political rhetoric.
Trump traveled to the historic hub of the city’s Jewish community as the first funerals were held for the victims, who range in age from 54 to 97. The dead include a set of brothers, a husband and wife, professors, dentists and a physician. It was not immediately clear whether Trump would meet with any family members.
Those who live in the tight-knit community were uncertain about whether they wanted the presidential visit. To Marianne Novy, Trump wasn’t wanted “unless he really changes his ways.” For David Dvir, politics should take a pause for grief: “It’s our president, and we need to welcome him.”
Barry Werber, 76, who said he survived the massacre by hiding in a dark storage closet as the gunman rampaged through the building, said he hoped Trump wouldn’t visit, noting that the president has embraced the politically fraught label of “nationalist.” Werber said the Nazis were nationalists.
“It’s part of his program to instigate his base,” Werber said, and “bigots are coming out of the woodwork.”
Novy, 73, a retired college English professor, said she signed an open letter asking Trump not to come to Pittsburgh. “His language has encouraged hatred and fear of immigrants, which is part of the reason why these people were killed,” she said.
Just minutes before the synagogue attack, the shooter apparently used social media to rage against HIAS, a Jewish organization that resettles refugees under contract with the U.S. government.
Dvir, 52, the owner of Murray Avenue Locksmith in Squirrel Hill, said of Trump: “I think he made some mistakes, but he is a great president.” He added that it would be “a shame” if the community protested the president’s visit.
Asked Monday if Trump had done enough to condemn white nationalism, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said the president “has denounced racism, hatred and bigotry in all forms on a number of occasions.”
Beth Melena, campaign spokeswoman for Wolf, said the governor did not plan to return to Pittsburgh as part of Trump’s visit on Tuesday. She said he based his decision on input from the victims’ families, who told him they did not want the president to be there on the day their loved ones were being buried.
“Community leaders expressed to the governor that they did not feel it was appropriate for Trump to come, so the governor made a decision not to join him on his visit out of respect for the families and the community,” Melena said.

Robert Gregory Bowers, who was wounded in a gun battle with police during the shooting rampage, was released from a hospital and wheeled into the courtroom, where he was ordered held without bail for a preliminary hearing on Thursday, when prosecutors will outline their case against him.
During the proceeding, Bowers talked with two court-appointed lawyers, went over documents and confirmed his identity to a judge, saying little more than “Yes” in a soft voice a few times. Courtroom deputies freed one of his hands from cuffs so he could sign paperwork. He did not enter a plea.
He was expressionless.
“It was not the face of villainy that I thought we’d see,” said Jon Pushinsky, a congregant who was in court for the hearing.
Federal prosecutors set in motion plans to seek the death penalty against the 46-year-old truck driver, who authorities say expressed hatred of Jews during the rampage at the Tree of Life synagogue and later told police, “I just want to kill Jews” and “All these Jews need to die.”
After the hearing, U.S. Attorney Scott Brady called the shootings “horrific acts of violence” and added: “Rest assured we have a team of prosecutors working hard to ensure that justice is done.”
Meanwhile, the first funeral — for Cecil Rosenthal and his younger brother, David — was set for Tuesday, and the White House announced President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump will visit the same day to “express the support of the American people and to grieve with the Pittsburgh community.”
The response to Trump’s plans was mixed.
Leaders of a liberal Jewish group in Pittsburgh, Bend the Arc, wrote an open letter to the president, accusing him of contributing to the violence with his words and deeds and saying he was not welcome until he denounced white nationalism.
But Rabbi Jeffrey Myers with the Tree of Life synagogue made clear Trump would be welcome, telling NBC, “It would be my honor to always meet a president of the United States.”

The weekend massacre — which took place 10 days before the midterm elections — heightened tensions around the country, coming just a day after the arrest of the Florida man accused of sending a wave of pipe bombs to Trump critics.
The mail bomb attacks and the bloodshed in Pittsburgh set off debate over whether the corrosive political climate in Washington and beyond contributed to the violence and whether Trump himself bears any blame because of his combative language.
Barry Werber, 76, said he found himself hiding in a dark storage closet as the gunman rampaged through the building, in the tree-lined neighborhood of Squirrel Hill, the historic hub of the city’s Jewish community.
Werber said he hopes Trump doesn’t visit Pittsburgh, noting that the president has embraced the politically fraught label of “nationalist.” He said the Nazis were nationalists.
“It’s part of his program to instigate his base,” Werber said, and “bigots are coming out of the woodwork.”
Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto, a Democrat, said the White House should contact the victims‘ families and ask them if they want the president to come to Pittsburgh. He also warned Trump to stay away when the first funerals are held.
“If the president is looking to come to Pittsburgh, I would ask that he not do so while we are burying the dead,” Peduto said. “Our attention and our focus is going to be on them, and we don’t have public safety that we can take away from what is needed in order to do both.”
Bowers killed eight men and three women before a police tactical team shot him, authorities said. Six other people were wounded, including four officers. Four of the wounded remained hospitalized Sunday night, two in critical condition.
The president of the hospital where a wounded Bowers was taken said that he was ranting against Jews even as Jewish staff members were treating him.
“He’s taken into my hospital and he’s shouting, ‘I want to kill all the Jews!’ and the first three people who are taking care of him are Jewish,” Jeffery Cohen of Allegheny General Hospital told WTAE-TV. “Ain’t that a kick in the pants?”
Cohen, who is also Jewish and a member of Tree of Life synagogue, said he stopped by Bowers’ room.
“I just asked how he was doing, was he in pain, and he said no, he was fine,” he told WTAE. “He asked who I was, and I said, ‘I’m Dr. Cohen, the president of the hospital,’ and I turned around and left.”
He said the FBI agent outside Bowers’ room told him he didn’t think he could have done that. “And I said, ‘If you were in my shoes I’m sure you could have,'” Cohen said.
Bowers was charged in a 29-count federal criminal complaint that included counts of obstructing the exercise of religious beliefs resulting in death — a hate crime — and using a gun to commit murder.
Bowers was also charged under state law with criminal homicide, aggravated assault and ethnic intimidation.
Just minutes before the synagogue attack, Bowers apparently took to social media to rage against HIAS, a Jewish organization that resettles refugees under contract with the U.S. government.
“HIAS likes to bring invaders in that kill our people,” he is believed to have written on Gab.com, a social media site favored by right-wing extremists. “I can’t sit by and watch my people get slaughtered. Screw your optics, I’m going in.”
HIAS had recently weighed in on the migrant caravan heading toward the U.S. from Central America, urging the Trump administration to “provide all asylum seekers the opportunity to present their claims as required by law.” The president has vilified the caravan and pledged to stop the migrants.
One of the targets of the mail bomb attacks last week was liberal Jewish philanthropist George Soros, who has been accused by far-right conspiracy theorists of paying migrants to join the caravan.
The youngest of the 11 dead was 54, the oldest 97. The toll included a husband and wife, professors, dentists and physicians.
Bowers shot his victims with an AR-15, used in many of the nation’s mass shootings, and three handguns, all of which he owned legally and had a license to carry, according to a law enforcement official who wasn’t authorized to discuss the investigation and spoke on condition of anonymity.
Bowers was a long-haul trucker who worked for himself, authorities said. Little else was known about Bowers, who had no apparent criminal record.

The 20-minute attack at Tree of Life Congregation in the Squirrel Hill neighborhood left at least six others wounded, including four police officers who dashed to the scene, authorities said.
The suspect, Robert Bowers, traded gunfire with police and was shot several times. Bowers, who was in fair condition at a hospital, was expected to face federal hate-crime charges.
“Please know that justice in this case will be swift and it will be severe,” Scott Brady, the chief federal prosecutor in western Pennsylvania, said at a late-afternoon news conference, characterizing the slaughter as a “terrible and unspeakable act of hate.”

The shooting came amid a rash of high-profile attacks in an increasingly divided country, including the series of pipe bombs mailed over the past week to prominent Democrats and former officials.
The shooting also immediately reignited the longstanding national debate about guns: President Donald Trump said the outcome might have been different if the synagogue “had some kind of protection” from an armed guard, while Pennsylvania’s Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf noted that once again “dangerous weapons are putting our citizens in harm’s way.”
Bob Jones, head of the FBI’s Pittsburgh office, said that worshippers “were brutally murdered by a gunman targeting them simply because of their faith,” though he cautioned the shooter’s full motive was not yet known.
The social media site Gab.com said the alleged shooter had a profile on its website, which is popular with far-right extremists. The company said the account was verified after the shooting and matched the name of the gunman.
A man with the same name posted on Gab before the shooting that “HIAS likes to bring invaders in that kill our people. I can’t sit by and watch my people get slaughtered. Screw your optics, I’m going in.”
HIAS is a nonprofit group that helps refugees around the world find safety and freedom. The organization says it is guided by Jewish values and history.
Bowers also recently posted a photo of a collection of three semi-automatic handguns he titled “my glock family,” a reference to the firearms manufacturer. He also posted photos of bullet holes in person-sized targets at a firing range, touting the “amazing trigger” on a handgun he was offering for sale.
The attack took place during a baby-naming ceremony, according to Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro. During a Jewish baby naming ceremony, the baby is given his or her Hebrew name. The name could be a name that sounds like the baby’s secular name or has significance in his or her family’s history.
Officials later said that no children were hurt.
“It is a very horrific crime scene. It’s one of the worst that I’ve seen and I’ve been on some plane crashes,” said a visibly moved Wendell Hissrich, the Pittsburgh public safety director.

The synagogue is located in the tree-lined residential neighborhood of Squirrel Hill, about 10 minutes from downtown Pittsburgh and the hub of Pittsburgh’s Jewish community.
Jonathan Greenblatt, chief executive officer of the Anti-Defamation League, said the group believes it is the deadliest attack on the Jewish community in U.S. history.
“Our hearts break for the families of those killed and injured at the Tree of Life Synagogue, and for the entire Jewish community of Pittsburgh,” Greenblatt said.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he was “heartbroken and appalled” by the attack.
“The entire people of Israel grieve with the families of the dead,” Netanyahu said. “We stand together with the Jewish community of Pittsburgh. We stand together with the American people in the face of this horrendous anti-Semitic brutality. And we all pray for the speedy recovery of the wounded.”
World Jewish Congress President Ronald S. Lauder called the shooting “an attack not just on the Jewish community, but on America as a whole.”
Trump called the shooting a “wicked act of mass murder” that “is pure evil, hard to believe and frankly something that is unimaginable.”
Trump has at times been accused by critics of failing to adequately condemn hate, such as when he blamed “both sides” for the violence at a Charlottesville white supremacist rally.
On Saturday, he said that anti-Semitism “must be confronted anywhere and everywhere it appears.”
The synagogue is a fortress-like concrete building, its facade punctuated by rows of swirling, modernistic stained-glass windows illustrating the story of creation, the acceptance of God’s law, the “life cycle” and “how human-beings should care for the earth and one another,” according to its website. Among its treasures is a “Holocaust Torah,” rescued from Czechoslovakia.
Its sanctuary can hold up to 1,250 people.
Michael Eisenberg, the immediate past president of the Tree of Life Synagogue, lives about a block from the building.
He was getting ready for services when he received a phone call from a member who works with Pittsburgh’s Emergency Services, saying he had been notified through scanner and other communications that there was an active shooter at their synagogue.
“I ran out of the house without changing and I saw the street blocked with police cars. It was a surreal scene. And someone yelled, ‘Get out of here.’ I realized it was a police officer along the side of the house. … I am sure I know all of the people, all of the fatalities. I am just waiting to see,” Eisenberg said.
He said officials at the synagogue had not gotten any threats that he knew of prior to the shooting. The synagogue maintenance employees had recently checked all of the emergency exits and doors to make sure they were cleared and working.
“I spoke to a maintenance person who was in the building and heard the shots. He was able to escape through one of the side exit doors we had made sure was functioning,” Eisenberg said.
Eisenberg said the larger main synagogue, Tree of Life, had let two other smaller congregations use space at the synagogue on Saturdays, and that all three were meeting at the time.
Jeff Finkelstein of the Jewish Federation of Greater Pittsburgh said local synagogues have done “lots of training on things like active shooters, and we’ve looked at hardening facilities as much as possible.”
“This should not be happening, period,” he told reporters at the scene. “This should not be happening in a synagogue.”
Just three days before the shooting, Rabbi Jeffrey Myers posted a column on the congregation’s website, noting that people make time to attend funerals, but not for life’s happy occasions.
“There is a story told in the Talmud of a wedding procession and a funeral procession heading along parallel roads, with the roads intersecting,” Myers wrote on Wednesday. “The question asked is: when they meet at the fork, which procession goes first, funeral or wedding? The correct answer is wedding, as the joy of the couple takes precedence. In fact, the funeral procession is to move out of sight so that their joy is not lessened.”
Myers ended his column with words that now seem all too prescient.
“We value joy so much in Judaism that upon taking our leave from a funeral or a shiva house, the customary statement one makes (in Yiddish) is ‘nor oyf simches’ – only for s’machot,” Myers wrote. “While death is inevitable and a part of life, we still take our leave with the best possible blessing, to meet at joyous events. And so I say to you: nor oyf simches!”

Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto has announced what he called the “You are at home” plan, offering shelter, medical attention, schooling and jobs to Central Americans in Chiapas and Oaxaca states if migrants apply, calling it a first step toward permanent refugee status. Authorities said more than 1,700 had already applied for refugee status.
But a standoff unfolded as federal police officers blocked the highway, saying there was an operation underway to stop the caravan. Thousands of migrants waited to advance, vowing to continue their long trek toward the U.S. border.
At a meeting brokered by Mexico’s National Human Rights Commission, police said they would reopen the highway and only wanted an opportunity for federal authorities to explain the proposal to migrants who had rejected it the previous evening. Migrants countered that the middle of a highway was no place to negotiate and said they wanted to at least arrive safely to Mexico City to discuss the topic with authorities and Mexican lawmakers.
They agreed to relay information back to their respective sides and said they would reconvene.
Orbelina Orellana, a migrant from San Pedro Sula, Honduras, said she and her husband left three children behind and had decided to continue north one way or another.
“Our destiny is to get to the border,” Orellana said.
She was suspicious of the government’s proposal and said that some Hondurans who had applied for legal status had already been sent back. Her claims could not be verified, but migrants’ representatives in the talks asked the Mexican government to provide a list of anyone who had been forced to return.

The standoff comes after one of the caravan’s longest days of walking and hanging from passing trucks on a 60-mile journey to the city of Arriaga.
The bulk of the migrants were boisterous Friday evening in their refusal to accept anything less than safe passage to the U.S. border.
“Thank you!” they yelled as they voted to reject the offer in a show of hands. They then added: “No, we’re heading north!”
Sitting at the edge of the edge of the town square, 58-year-old Oscar Sosa of San Pedro Sula, Honduras concurred.
“Our goal is not to remain in Mexico,” Sosa said. “Our goal is to make it to the (U.S). We want passage, that’s all.”
Still 1,000 miles from the nearest U.S. border crossing at McAllen, Texas, the journey could be twice as long if the group of some 4,000 migrants heads for the Tijuana-San Diego frontier, as another caravan did earlier this year. Only about 200 in that group made it to the border.
While such migrant caravans have taken place regularly over the years, passing largely unnoticed, they have received widespread attention this year after fierce opposition from U.S. President Donald Trump.
On Friday, the Pentagon approved a request for additional troops at the southern border, likely to total several hundred, to help the U.S. Border Patrol as Trump seeks to transform concerns about immigration and the caravan into electoral gains in the Nov. 6 midterms.
Defense Secretary Jim Mattis signed off on the request for help from the Department of Homeland Security and authorized the military staff to work out details such as the size, composition and estimated cost of the deployments, according to a U.S. official who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss planning that has not yet been publicly announced.
Stoking fears about the caravan and illegal immigration to rally his Republican base, the president insinuated that gang members and “Middle Easterners” are mixed in with the group, though he later acknowledged there was no proof of that.
At a church in Arriaga that opened its grounds to women and children Friday, Ana Griselda Hernandez, 44, of Mapala, Honduras, said she and two friends traveling with children had decided to pay for a bus ride from Pijijiapan, because the 4-year-old and 5-year-old would have never covered the 60-mile distance.
“It’s difficult because they walk very slowly,” she said. She pointed out scabbed-over blisters on her feet, a testament to the fact they had walked or hitched rides since leaving their country.
The caravan is now trying to strike out for Tapanatepec, about 29 miles away.
Up until now, Mexico’s government has allowed the migrants to make their way on foot, but has not provided them with food, shelter or bathrooms, reserving any aid for those who turn themselves in.
Police have also been ejecting paid migrant passengers off buses, enforcing an obscure road insurance regulation to make it tougher for them to travel that way.

On Friday, authorities were cracking down on smaller groups trying to catch up with the main caravan, detaining about 300 Hondurans and Guatemalans who crossed the Mexico border illegally, said an official with the national immigration authority.
Migrants, who enter Mexico illegally every day, usually ride in smugglers’ trucks or buses, or walk at night to avoid detection. The fact that the group of about 300 stragglers was walking in broad daylight suggests they were adopting the tactics of the main caravan, which is large enough to be out in the open without fear of mass detention.
However, it now appears such smaller groups will be picked off by immigration authorities, keeping them from swelling the caravan’s ranks.
On Friday evening, Irineo Mujica, whose organization People without Borders is supporting the caravan, accused Mexican immigration agents of harassment and urged migrants to travel closely together.
“They are terrorizing us,” he said.

The United Nations estimates the caravan has grown to about 7,200 migrants. The trek has entered the political debate ahead of the U.S. midterm elections.
Here is what we know and what’s next.
The caravan formed last week in northern Honduras and has grown in size ever since. The migrants reportedly are fleeing violence and poverty; many are hoping to find work in the U.S. to send money home to their families.
Over the weekend, more than 2,000 migrants crossed a bridge from Guatemala into Mexico in the Mexican town of Tapachula, while others tried crossing the Suchiate River.

As they entered Mexico, authorities put some people — mainly women, children and the elderly — on buses to take them to refugee camps. More than 1,000 people have requested asylum from Mexico, authorities said.
The Mexican government has requested help from the United Nations’ refugee agency to process the asylum requests.
The Associated Press reported on Wednesday that about 500 migrants, worn out from the trip, have accepted an offer from Mexican authorities to be bused back to their countries.
Police haven’t stopped the caravan outright, the Associated Press reported. As of Wednesday, the caravan was still more than 1,000 miles away from the nearest U.S. entry point in Texas.

Caravans have been staged for years by immigrant rights groups to raise awareness of the migrants’ troubles. This most recent one has been notable for its size and the attention it garnered.
“There have been periodic caravans, though none of this size and media coverage,” said Shannon O’Neil, a senior fellow for Latin America Studies at the Council on Foreign Relations. “It comes from a push of violence, poverty, and the lack of opportunities and a pull of U.S. possibilities — and often family — as well as smugglers urging clients and potential clients on,” she said.
While massive organized caravans are not commonplace, “more and more migrants have considered as matter of safety to travel in groups because of the dangers with traffickers and other delinquency taking place in the trek, particularly Mexico,” said Manuel Orozco, director of Migration, Remittances and Development at the Inter-American Dialogue.
In April, when a caravan organized by Pueblo Sin Fronteras — a group that has organized these events for years to draw attention to the violence migrants face in their home countries — moved through Mexico toward the U.S., it ended up dissipating. Some migrants sought asylum in Mexico instead, while others split off and attempted to cross into the U.S. on their own.
By the time the April caravan reached the U.S., its numbers shrank from more than 1,000 to about 200.
No group has taken responsibility for organizing the current caravan.

Mexico has responded to the latest caravan by ramping up the number of immigration and police officials to monitor the southern border, in a bid to intercept the group earlier as it made its way from Guatemala.
Mexico also outlined a plan to address the thousands of Central American migrants moving through the country.
Some highlights:
As the caravan continues its journey north, President Donald Trump has called on the migrants’ home countries and Mexico to intervene.
The president threatened Monday on Twitter to begin “cutting off, or substantially reducing” aid to Central American countries because the Guatemalan, Honduran and El Salvadoran governments have failed to stop the caravan from leaving their countries, he said on Twitter.
Trump also tweeted that he has “alerted Border Patrol and Military” to the caravan heading to the U.S. southern border.
Previously, Trump has threatened to close off the U.S.-Mexico border if Mexican officials aren’t able to stop the caravans.
“I must, in the strongest of terms, ask Mexico to stop this onslaught — and if unable to do so I will call up the U.S. Military and CLOSE OUR SOUTHERN BORDER!” Trump tweeted last week.
In April, Trump asked the Department of Homeland Security to turn away that caravan if it reached the U.S.-Mexico border.
The U.S., however, cannot refuse migrants who are seeking asylum at the border, according to both the country’s own laws and international law.
“I think it’s just a way for him to rile up Americans who fear brown immigrants invading their borders, to create this image that a caravan of Central Americans are coming to descend upon America,” attorney Nicole Ramos told the PBS NewsHour during the earlier caravan’s efforts.

Mexican Foreign Secretary Luis Videgaray Caso recently met with U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo about caravans, saying that “of course, in Mexico we have the rule of law, and we shall apply — enforce the law, but there will also be a humanitarian way that we will think about the migrant in the first place.”
With midterm elections approaching on Nov. 6, Trump’s message on Twitter and at campaign rallies is that Democrats are hindering immigration laws that would address the issue.
“Every time you see a Caravan, or people illegally coming, or attempting to come, into our Country illegally, think of and blame the Democrats for not giving us the votes to change our pathetic Immigration Laws! Remember the Midterms! So unfair to those who come in legally,” Trump tweeted.
Mexico itself is transitioning to a new government: Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto has about six weeks left in office before his successor, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, takes over Dec. 1. During his presidential campaign, Lopez Obrador has pledged a softer approach to immigration in Mexico, promising to protect the human rights of migrants."
https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/ap-fact-check-trump-on-migrants-saudis-and-the-hispanic-vote,refugee,2916,2018-10-22T10:23:16-04:00,"Hope Yen, Associated Press","AP fact check: Trump on migrants, Saudis, and the Hispanic vote","WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump inflated the projected benefits of an arms deal with the Saudis as he defended his wait-and-see attitude about Saudi complicity in the disappearance of a journalist whose apparent murder has sparked world outrage.
On immigration enforcement, the president made the unsubstantiated claim that migrants are being paid to mass at the border and somehow disrupt the Nov. 6 elections in the United States. Trump also stretched credulity when boasting about his performance with Hispanic voters at a rally and distorted facts concerning climate change and the Russia investigation in a recent interview with The Associated Press.
A look at some of his words over the past week:
TRUMP: “We’re doing very well with Hispanic Americans. We’re doing very well. Because you know what? They want safety at the border. They want great jobs. Remember, the last election, well, ‘he won’t do too well with the Hispanic vote.’ Did we do well or what?” — Arizona rally Friday.
THE FACTS: More “what” than “well.”
Among Hispanics, Democrat Hillary Clinton beat Trump handily in 2016, 66 percent to 28 percent, according to exit polls. That level of Hispanic support for a Democratic candidate was similar to 2008, when Barack Obama gained 67 percent of the Hispanic vote to Republican John McCain’s 31 percent.
At the same time, Clinton’s performance among Hispanics lagged their support for Obama in 2012, when he won 71 percent to Republican Mitt Romney’s 27 percent.
Trump in 2016 had campaigned heavily on a platform of building a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, calling for mass deportations and referring to some Mexicans as rapists. Given that record, it’s fair to claim he outperformed expectations with Hispanic voters, but he did worse or at least no better than McCain in 2008.
TRUMP, on a caravan of Central American migrants trying to reach the U.S.: “A lot of money’s been passing through people to come up and try to get to the border by Election Day because they think that’s a negative for us.” — Montana rally Thursday.
TRUMP on the caravan: “Can you believe this, and what Democrats are allowing to be done to our Country?” — tweet Thursday.
THE FACTS: Trump was riffing off of an unsupported allegation by Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., that people were being paid in Honduras to join the caravan and “storm the border @ election time,” as Gaetz tweeted.
Gaetz tweeted a video on Wednesday of men handing out money to people standing in a line, without evidence that it illustrated his claim. Questioned about the video’s origin, Gaetz posted a correction on Twitter, saying, “This video was provided to me by a Honduran government official. Thus, I believed it to be from Honduras.”
UPDATE: Because a Honduran government official sent me this video, I believed it came from Honduras. https://t.co/Jhh2231TNL
— Rep. Matt Gaetz (@RepMattGaetz) October 18, 2018
Neither man has produced evidence that the migrants are being paid to come to the border.
Mexico’s government says migrants with proper documents can enter Mexico and those who don’t either have to apply for refugee status or face deportation.
TRUMP: “Frankly they have a tremendous order — $110 billion. Every country in the world wanted a piece of that order. We got all of it. And what are we going to do? Again, I’ve had some senators come up and some congressmen that said, ‘Well, you know, sir, I think what we should do is we should not take that order.’ I said, ‘Who are we hurting? It’s 500,000 jobs.'” — interview Wednesday with Fox Business News.
TRUMP, on possible action against Saudi Arabia: “I’ll be working on this with Congress. … But I would prefer that we don’t use as retribution canceling $110 billion worth of work, which means 600,000 jobs. … I went there to get that order.” — remarks Friday at a defense event in Arizona.
THE FACTS: Trump’s wrong to suggest that he has $110 billion in military orders from Saudi Arabia. A far smaller amount in sales has actually been signed. His State Department has also estimated much fewer U.S. jobs than Trump’s figure of 500,000 to 600,000, projecting “potentially tens of thousands.”
Details of the $110 billion arms package, partly negotiated under the Obama administration and agreed upon in May 2017, have been sketchy. At the time the Trump administration provided only a broad description of the defense equipment that would be sold. There was no public breakdown of exactly what was being offered for sale and for how much.
The Congressional Research Service described the package as a combination of sales proposed by Obama and discussed with Congress and new sales still being developed.
The Pentagon said this month that Saudi Arabia has signed “letters of offer and acceptance” for only $14.5 billion in sales, including helicopters, tanks, ships, weapons and training. Those letters, issued after the U.S. government has approved a proposed sale, specify its terms.
Regarding economic impact, Trump’s claim of about 500,000 jobs involved — he later upped that figure to 600,000 — is questionable given the tenuous nature of the orders. A May 20, 2017, State Department fact sheet on the proposed $110 billion deal estimated it could end up “potentially supporting tens of thousands of new jobs in the United States.”
Trump’s repeated claims that he’s signed $110 billion worth of new arms sales to Riyadh are “just not true,” said Bruce Riedel, a senior fellow at Brookings Institution and former CIA and Defense Department official. “Very little has changed hands.”
Trump has pledged unspecified “severe punishment” should the U.S. determine Saudi involvement in the disappearance of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, who had written columns critical of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. But Trump has said he does not want to halt the arms sale to Saudi Arabia because it would harm U.S. manufacturers. Saudi Arabia is indeed a major U.S. ally and arms customer.
Trump on Friday called Saudi Arabia’s announcement that suspects in Khashoggi’s death are in custody a “good first step.” Saudi Arabia has claimed that Khashoggi was killed in a “fistfight” at the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul.
Trump said that before he decided what to do next, he wanted to talk to Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.
TRUMP, speaking about the failed nomination of White House doctor Ronny Jackson to be Veterans Affairs secretary: “Ever since his vicious and totally false statements about Admiral Ron Jackson, the highly respected White House Doctor for Obama, Bush & me, Senator John Tester looks to be in big trouble in the Great State of Montana! He behaved worse than the Democrat Mob did with Justice K!” — tweet Wednesday.
THE FACTS: Trump misleads by seeking to place the blame for Jackson’s failed nomination entirely on Tester, the top Democrat on the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee. It also remains unclear whether the late-surfacing allegations against Jackson are “totally false” because the Pentagon inspector general is continuing to review some of them.
Jackson, a Navy rear admiral, withdrew his nomination in April after Tester released results of committee interviews he conducted with military personnel who raised questions about Jackson’s prescribing practices and leadership ability. The interviews were done with the knowledge and support of Sen. Johnny Isakson, R-Ga., chairman of the committee considering Jackson’s nomination.
The time period covered Jackson’s tenure as a White House physician dating to 2006 and involved his current and former colleagues who served in both Republican and Democratic administrations.
Jackson, who broadly denied allegations of bad behavior, had already faced tough questions from several committee Republicans about whether he had the experience to manage the massive VA.
The allegations were referred to the Pentagon’s inspector general for evaluation. After an initial assessment and review, the inspector general’s office in June decided a formal investigation was warranted. That probe is continuing, according to the office.
TRUMP: “I want the cleanest air on the planet and our air now is cleaner than it’s ever been.” — AP interview Tuesday.
THE FACTS: He’s wrong about the air being the cleanest ever, according to his own administration. While the air generally has been getting cleaner since the 1970s, the downward trend in pollution has made a bit of a U-turn since Trump took office.
His Environmental Protection Agency released data that showed traditional air pollution — soot and smog — increased in 2017 and that the air is not the cleanest it has ever been.
The days with an unhealthy number of small pollution particles, often called soot and linked to heart and lung problems and deaths, jumped from 2016 to 2017 in 35 major metropolitan areas. In 2017, there were 179 unhealthy soot days, up 85 percent from 97 in 2016. Last year had the most unhealthy soot days since 2011.
The number of days with unhealthy smog levels was down from 2016, but higher than 2015, 2014 and 2013.
The number of days when the air quality index was unhealthy was 729 in 2017. The number of days is higher than a year because it counts each city’s unhealthy reading on a certain day as one and there are numerous cities involved. Last year’s level was the highest since 2012 and a 21 percent increase over the cleanest air in 2014.
TRUMP, when asked about a dire U.N. report this month on climate change that said dangerous warming has already happened and that with each degree, the many harms to Earth will get even more treacherous: “No, no. Some say that and some say differently, I mean you have scientists on both sides of it.” — AP interview Tuesday.
THE FACTS: He’s wrong to suggest the scientific community is substantially split. Scientists from around the world wrote the recent report, and it was unanimously accepted by government representatives around the world, including in the United States, said Cornell University climate scientist Natalie Mahowald, a lead author of the report.
The Trump administration last year also released the National Climate Assessment, which painted a similar picture.
University of Illinois climate scientist Donald Wuebbles, a lead author of that national report, emailed that “there is no debate AT ALL going on about this within the scientific community.”
“Trump might as well be saying that there are scientists on ‘both sides of the gravity debate,'” Pennsylvania State University climate scientist Michael Mann said in an email. “Dangerous climate change impacts are already apparent. Of course there are uncertainties. There always are. There are uncertainties in the science of gravity (we have never measured a graviton, the fundamental unit of gravity). That doesn’t make it safe to jump off a cliff.”
TRUMP: “We have the worst laws in the history of the world on immigration and we’re getting them changed one by one. We’ve made a lot of progress in the last couple of weeks even, but we’re getting them changed one by one.” — AP interview Tuesday.
THE FACTS: He’s actually failed to achieve changes in immigration laws. All the immigration-related changes pushed by his administration were done by executive order, not legislation, or through policy shifts such as the zero tolerance policy that criminally prosecuted anyone caught crossing illegally and gave rise to family separations. The administration also has used regulations to tighten the rules on how immigrants can receive public benefits. Immigration legislation has failed despite Republican control of the White House and both houses of Congress.
TRUMP, on the separation of children from their parents at the border: “Now President Obama had the same law. He did the same thing.” — AP interview Tuesday.
THE FACTS: Obama did not do the same thing as a matter of policy. It’s true the underlying laws were the same. But the Trump administration mandated anyone caught crossing the border illegally was to be criminally prosecuted. The policy meant adults were taken to court for criminal proceedings, and their children were separated and sent into the care of the Health and Human Services Department, which is tasked with caring for unaccompanied migrant children. The zero tolerance policy remains in effect, but Trump signed an executive order June 20 that stopped separations.
Jeh Johnson, Obama’s homeland security secretary, told NPR there may have been unusual or emergency circumstances when children were taken from parents but there was no such policy.
TRUMP: “And in fact the picture of children living in cages that was taken in 2014 was a picture of President Obama’s administration and the way they handled children. They had the kids living in cages. They thought it was our administration and they used it, and then unbeknownst to them and the fake news they found out, ‘Oh my God, this is a terrible situation.’ This was during the Obama administration.” — AP interview Tuesday.
THE FACTS: He’s right. Images that circulated online during the height of Trump’s family separations controversy were actually from 2014 under the Obama administration. But circumstances for some children have not changed. In June, an Associated Press reporter was part of a group that visited a U.S. Border Patrol holding facility, where hundreds of children were waiting in a series of cages created by metal fencing. One cage had 20 children inside, scattered around were bottles of water, bags of chips and large foil sheets intended to serve as blankets. The cages in each wing opened out into common areas to use portable restrooms.
The children both in 2014 and 2018 were separated temporarily from their parents in the facilities, placed in areas by age and sex for safety reasons.
TRUMP, about special counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation: “It’s a tremendous waste of time for the president of the United States. To think that I would be even thinking about using Russia to help me win Idaho, we’re using Russia to help me win the great state of Iowa or anywhere else is the most preposterous, embarrassing thing.” — AP interview Tuesday.
THE FACTS: Trump may be right that he did not need a boost in Idaho and Iowa, states he won in 2016 with comfortable margins of 31 percentage points and 9 percentage points, respectively. But the notion of Russia-backed activities on his behalf “anywhere else” in the U.S. is not far-fetched, according to an indictment in February by Mueller.
The indictment accuses 13 Russians and three Russian entities of seeking to help Trump defeat Democrat Hillary Clinton by running a hidden social media trolling campaign and seeking to mobilize Trump supporters at rallies while posing as American political activists in “purple states like Colorado, Virginia and Florida.” According to the indictment, the surreptitious campaign was organized by the Internet Research Agency, a Russian troll farm financed by companies controlled by Yevgeny Prigozhin, a wealthy businessman with ties to President Vladimir Putin.
The indictment says the defendants commonly referred to targeting more closely divided “purple states” after being advised by a Texas-based grass-roots organization in June 2016 to focus efforts there.
The indictment details contacts targeting three unidentified officials in the Trump campaign’s Florida operation. In each instance, the Russians used false U.S. personas to contact the officials. The indictment doesn’t say if any of them responded.
Trump lost by nearly 2.9 million votes in the popular vote to Clinton, but captured the needed Electoral College votes to win the presidency after prevailing in politically divided states including Florida, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.
TRUMP, on his former personal lawyer, Michael Cohen: “By the way, he was in trouble not for what he did for me; he was in trouble for what he did for himself. You do know that? Having to do with loans, mortgages, taxicabs and various other things, if you read the paper.” — AP interview Tuesday.
THE FACTS: Cohen was definitely in trouble for what he did for Trump. He stated in open court that Trump directed him to arrange payments of hush money to porn star Stormy Daniels and former Playboy model, Karen McDougal, to fend off damage to Trump’s White House bid.
Cohen said one payment was made “in coordination and at the direction of a candidate for federal office,” and the other was made “under direction of the same candidate.”
It is true that Cohen did not identify Trump, but there was no ambiguity in court documents or in his statement.
Cohen’s extraordinary statement at his August plea hearing marked the first time any Trump associate, in open court, has implicated the president himself in a crime.
Trump is, however, correct that other charges which Cohen admitted to didn’t involve the candidate or the campaign and were for tax deception.
TRUMP: “Do you know these Russian hackers you’re talking about from Moscow? They have nothing to do with me. … They were hackers from Moscow. Some of them supported Hillary Clinton.” — AP interview Tuesday.
THE FACTS: The Mueller indictment offers no evidence or reason to believe that the Russian effort was intended to help elect Clinton — quite the opposite. Some anti-Trump messaging tied to Russians was indeed disseminated online, but investigators believe the motive was to spread confusion and discord in the campaign, not to elect her.
The pro-Trump efforts identified in the indictment were strategic, on the ground in key states as well as online, and included attempts to make contact with Trump campaign officials. Russian President Vladimir Putin, while denying any involvement in Russian interference, has said he wanted Trump to win.

Their numbers swelled to about 5,000 overnight and at first light they set out walking toward the Mexican town of Tapachula, 10 abreast in a line stretching approximately a mile (1.5 kilometers).
It was not immediately clear where the additional travelers had materialized from since about 2,000 gathered on the Mexican side Saturday night. They seemed likely to be people who had been waiting on the bridge over the Suchiate River or in the Guatemalan town of Tecun Uman and who decided to cross during the night.
At dawn there were still an estimated 1,500 migrants on the Guatemalan side hoping to enter legally.
They marched on through Mexico like a rag tag army of the poor, shouting triumphantly slogans like “Si se pudo!” or “Yes, we could!”

As they passed through Mexican villages on the outskirts of Ciudad Hidalgo, they drew applause, cheers and donations of food and clothing from Mexicans.
Maria Teresa Orellana, a resident of the neighborhood of Lorenzo handed out free sandals to the migrants as they passed. “It’s solidarity,” she said. “They’re our brothers.”
Olivin Castellanos, 58, a truck driver and mason from Villanueva, Honduras, said he took a raft across the river after Mexico blocked the bridge. “No one will stop us, only God,” he said. “We knocked down the door and we continue walking.” He wants to reach the U.S. to work. “I can do this,” he said, pointing to the asphalt under his feet. “I’ve made highways.”
The migrants, who said they gave up trying to enter Mexico legally because the asylum application process was too slow, gathered Saturday at a park in the border city of Ciudad Hidalgo. They voted by a show of hands to continue north en masse, then marched to the bridge crossing the Suchiate River and urged those still on it to come join them.

The decision to re-form the migrant caravan capped a day in which Mexican authorities again refused mass entry to migrants on the bridge, instead accepting small groups for asylum processing and giving out 45-day visitor permits to some. Authorities handed out numbers for people to be processed in a strategy seen before at U.S. border posts when dealing with large numbers of migrants.
But many became impatient and circumventing the border gate, crossing the river on rafts, by swimming or by wading in full view of the hundreds of Mexican police manning the blockade on the bridge. Some paid locals the equivalent of $1.25 to ferry them across the muddy waters. They were not detained on reaching the Mexican bank.
Sairy Bueso, a 24-year old Honduran mother of two, was another migrant who abandoned the bridge and crossed into Mexico via the river. She clutched her 2-year-old daughter Dayani, who had recently had a heart operation, as she got off a raft.
“The girl suffered greatly because of all the people crowded” on the bridge, Bueso said. “There are risks that we must take for the good of our children.”
In addition to those who crossed the river, immigration agents processed migrants in small groups and then bused them to an open-air, metal-roof fairground in Tapachula, where the Red Cross set up small blue tents on the concrete floor.
Mexico’s Interior Department said it had received 640 refugee requests by Hondurans at the border crossing. It released photos of migrants getting off buses at a shelter and receiving food and medical attention.
At least half a dozen migrants fainted in the crush.
Some tore open a fence on the Guatemala side of the bridge and threw two young children, perhaps age 6 or 7, and their mother into the muddy waters about 40 feet below. They were rafted to safety in on the Mexican bank.
Mexican workers handed food and bottled water to the migrants on the bridge. Through the bars, a doctor gave medical attention to a woman who feared her young son was running a fever.
Sustenance also came from Guatemalan locals — for Carlos Martinez, a 24-year-old from Santa Barbara, Honduras, the plate of chicken with rice was the first bite to eat he’d had all day.
“It is a blessing that they have given us food,” Martinez said. “It gives me courage to keep waiting, as long as I can.”
Migrants cited widespread poverty and gang violence in Honduras, one of the world’s deadliest nations by homicide rate, as their reasons for joining the caravan.
Juan Carlos Mercado, 20, from Santa Barbara, Honduras, says corruption and a lack of jobs in Honduras has stymied him. “We just want to move ahead with our lives,” he said Sunday. He said he’d do any kind of work.
The caravan elicited a series of angry tweets and warnings from Trump early in the week, but Mexico’s initial handling of the migrants at its southern border seemed to have satisfied him more recently.
“So as of this moment, I thank Mexico,” Trump said Friday at an event in Scottsdale, Arizona. “I hope they continue. But as of this moment, I thank Mexico. If that doesn’t work out, we’re calling up the military — not the Guard.”
“They’re not coming into this country,” Trump added.
“The Mexican Government is fully engaged in finding a solution that encourages safe, secure, and orderly migration,” State Department Spokeswoman Heather Nauert said Saturday, “and both the United States and Mexico continue to work with Central American governments to address the economic, security, and governance drivers of illegal immigration.”
After an emergency meeting in Guatemala, presidents Hernandez of Honduras and Jimmy Morales of Guatemala said an estimated 5,400 migrants had entered Guatemala since the caravan was announced a week ago, and about 2,000 Hondurans have returned voluntarily.
Morales said a Honduran migrant died in the town of Villa Nueva, 20 miles (30 kilometers) from Guatemala City, when he fell from a truck.

Hundreds of migrants have already crossed, some legally, some not. Others left their spots on the bridge to go to a nearby Guatemalan town for food. It’s unclear whether any have simply turned back.
The group had burst through a Guatemalan border fence Friday and rushed onto the crossing over the Suchiate River, defying officials’ entreaties for an orderly crossing and U.S. President Donald Trump’s threats of retaliation. They were met by a wall of police with riot shields and pepper spray, and only about 50 migrants managed to push their way through before officers unleashed pepper spray. The rest retreated, joining the sea of people in limbo between both countries.
At an event in Scottsdale, Arizona on Friday, the U.S. president made it clear to Mexico that he is monitoring its response.
“So as of this moment, I thank Mexico. I hope they continue. But as of this moment, I thank Mexico,” he said. “If that doesn’t work out, we’re calling up the military — not the Guard.”

He also warned the migrants that they should turn back.
“They’re not coming into this country,” he said.
On Friday, Mexican police and immigration agents began letting small groups of 10, 20 or 30 people through the gates at a time if they wanted to apply for refugee status. Once they filed a claim, they were given the option to go to a shelter to spend the night.
Other migrants, tired of waiting, jumped off the bridge into the river. Some organized a rope brigade to ford its muddy waters or floated across on rafts operated by local residents who usually charge a dollar or two to make the crossing.
Carlos Rodriguez, 20, crossed the Suchiate River in a raft and reached the Mexican side. “I’m proud,” he said, after landing on Mexican soil.

Hundreds of others awoke amid garbage that had already piled up on the bridge. Without bathrooms, a foul odor wafted through the air.
Jose Yanez slept with no blanket, but vowed to continue.
“From here, we’re going on. From here, there’s no turning back,” said the 25-year-old farmer, adding that he makes 150 lempiras a day in Honduras, or about $6, and has no work benefits.
Organizers of the caravan appeared intent on avoiding a repeat of the rush on the border with Guatemala
Some women and children made their way toward the front of the caravan Saturday, while men were at the back.
They have also moved about 30 feet (9 meters) back from the gate that separates them from Mexican police to establish a buffer zone.
Late Friday night, Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto said that “Mexico does not permit and will not permit entry into its territory in an irregular fashion, much less in a violent fashion.”
Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez tweeted late Friday that he spoke with his Guatemalan counterpart, Jimmy Morales, and asked permission to send Honduran civil protection personnel to the bridge to help the migrants.
“I also asked authorization to hire ground transportation for anyone who wants to return and an air bridge for special cases of women, children, the elderly and the sick,” Hernandez tweeted.
Hernandez and Morales are expected to meet in Guatemala on Saturday to discuss the situation.
Acner Adolfo Rodriguez, 30, one of the last migrants through the breached Guatemala border fence, said he hoped to find work and a better life far from the widespread poverty and gang violence in Honduras, one of the world’s deadliest countries.
“May Trump’s heart be touched so he lets us through,” Rodriguez said.

Mexican officials said those with passports and valid visas — only a tiny minority of those trying to cross — would be let in immediately.
Migrants who want to apply for refuge in Mexico were welcome to do so, they said, but any who decide to cross illegally and are caught will be detained and deported.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo met Friday with Pena Nieto and Foreign Relations Secretary Luis Videgaray in Mexico City, with the caravan high on the agenda.
At a news conference with Videgaray, Pompeo called illegal migration a “crisis” and emphasized “the importance of stopping this flow before it reaches the U.S. border,” while also acknowledging Mexico’s right to handle the crisis in a sovereign fashion.
“Mexico will make its decision,” Pompeo said. “Its leaders and its people will decide the best way to achieve what I believe are our shared objectives.”
At Mexico City’s airport before leaving, Pompeo said four Mexican federal police officers had been injured in the border standoff and expressed his sympathy.

Migrants have banded together to travel en masse regularly in recent years, but this caravan was unusual for its huge size, said Victor Clark Alfaro, a Latin American studies professor at San Diego State University. By comparison, a caravan in April that also attracted Trump’s ire numbered about 1,000.
“It grabs one’s attention that the number of people in these kinds of caravans is on the rise,” Clark Alfaro said. “It is migration of a different dimension.”
Elizabeth Oglesby, a professor at the University of Arizona’s Center for Latin American Studies, said people join caravans like this because it’s a way to make the journey in a relatively safe manner and avoid having to pay thousands of dollars to smugglers. She disputed Pompeo’s assertion that that there is a “crisis” of migration.
“The border is not in crisis. This is not a migration crisis. … Yes, we are seeing some spikes in Central Americans crossing the border, but overall migration is at a 40-year low,” Oglesby said.
Speaking on the Televisa network, Videgaray did not seem concerned about Trump’s threat to close the U.S.-Mexico border, saying it had to be viewed in light of the hotly contested U.S. midterm elections, in which Trump has made border security a major campaign issue.
Videgaray noted that 1 million people transit the border legally every day, and about $1 million in commerce crosses every minute.
“Before taking decisions of that kind,” Videgaray said, “there would be many people in the United States … who would consider the consequences.”"

On the Mexican side of a border bridge, they were met by a phalanx of police with riot shields. About 50 managed to push their way through before officers unleashed pepper spray and the rest retreated.
The gates were closed again, and police used a loudspeaker to address the masses, saying, “We need you to stop the aggression.”
Mexican federal police chief Manelich Castilla, speaking from the border town of Ciudad Hidalgo, told Foro TV that his forces achieved their main objective of preventing a violent breach by the 3,000-plus migrants. In a separate interview with Milenio television, he accused people not part of the caravan of attacking police with firecrackers and rocks.
“It will be under the conditions that have been said since the start,” Castilla said. “Orderly, with established procedures, never through violence or force as a group of people attempted.”
The chaos calmed somewhat as migrants formed lines in a mass of humanity stretching across the bridge. Some returned to the Guatemalan side to buy water and food.
But others, tired of waiting, jumped off the bridge into the Suchiate River. Migrants organized a rope brigade to ford its muddy waters, and some floated across on rafts operated by local residents who charged a dollar or two to make the crossing.
Cristian, a 34-year-old cell phone repairman from San Pedro Sula, said he left Honduras because gang members had demanded protection payments of $83 a month, a fifth of his income. It was already hard enough to support his four daughters on the $450 he makes, so he closed his small business instead.
Cristian, who declined to give his last name because the gangsters had threatened him, estimated that about 30 percent of the migrants want to apply for refugee status in Mexico, while the rest want to reach the United States.
“I want to get to the States to contribute to that country,” Cristian said, “to do any kind of work, picking up garbage.”
Two buses arrived to transport women, children and the elderly to be processed by Mexican immigration authorities. But the migrants refused to board, fearing they would simply be deported.

“Walk! Walk!” they chanted, insisting they be allowed to continue on foot.
Earlier in the day, thousands of migrants, some waving Honduran flags and carrying umbrellas to protect against the sun, arrived at the Guatemalan side of the river, noisily demanding they be allowed to cross.
“One way or another, we will pass,” they chanted, climbing atop U.S.-donated military jeeps parked at the scene. Young men tugged on the fence, finally tearing it down, prompting the huge crowd of men, women and children to rush past and over the bridge.
Edwin Santos of San Pedro Sula was one of the first to race by, clutching the hands of his father and wife.
“We are going to the United States!” he shouted. “Nobody is going to stop us!”
Acner Adolfo Rodriguez, 30, one of the last through, said he hoped to find work and a better life far from the widespread poverty and gang violence in Honduras, one of the world’s deadliest countries.
“May Trump’s heart be touched so he lets us through,” Rodriguez said.
The U.S. president has made it clear to Mexico that he is monitoring its response. On Thursday he threatened to close the U.S. border if Mexico didn’t stop the caravan. Later that day he tweeted a video of Mexican federal police deploying at the Guatemalan border and wrote: “Thank you Mexico, we look forward to working with you!”

At Mexico City’s airport before leaving, Pompeo said four Mexican federal police officers had been injured in the border standoff and expressed his sympathy.
On Thursday, Videgaray asked the U.N. for help processing what Mexico expects to be a large number of asylum requests.
But Jose Porfirio Orellana, a 47-year-old farmer from Yoro province in Honduras, said he has his sights set on the United States due to woeful economic conditions in his country.
“There is nothing there,” Orellana said.

The first members of the group began arriving in Tecun Uman on buses and trucks early Thursday, but the bulk of the caravan sloshed into town on foot in a downpour late in the afternoon and into the evening. Before dawn Friday, the migrants decided to wait a few more hours for stragglers to arrive before heading to the border crossing.
Some planned to walk toward Mexican territory in a formation that put the men along the edges and women and children in the center. Others prepared to cross the river in rafts, the traditional way migrants enter. As the sun rose, a military helicopter flew along the Mexican side of river foreshadowing the difficulties they could face.
The migrants are mostly Hondurans, but others like Salvadoran Jonathan Guzman have joined the caravan en route. “It’s the third time that I’m trying to cross,” said the 22-year-old who dreams of finding a construction job in Los Angeles.
On Thursday, hundreds had walked to the river’s edge where they sang the national anthems of Honduras and Guatemala.
A smaller group walked to the border crossing but was blocked by Guatemalan police. They eventually retreated to await the rest of the caravan.
The exhausted travelers, the majority from Honduras, dispersed to the local migrant shelter and parks where volunteers offered them food.
Jonathan Perales, 22, arrived with his wife Heidy and their daughters ages 2 and 4. They’d been traveling since 4 a.m. and arrived at the border after dark. They paid for bus tickets they could ill afford.
“It was a great sacrifice, but it’s all for a better life,” he said. “It’s not all good. We’re wet and we still don’t have a place to sleep.”
On the Mexican side, the foreign ministry said its government was in constant communication with members of the caravan explaining the migrants’ options. It said officials were already assisting some migrants who had crossed and requested refugee status.
Trump has made it clear to Mexico that he is monitoring its response. Early Thursday, he threatened to close the U.S. border if Mexico let the migrants advance. Later, he retweeted a video of Mexican federal police arriving at the Guatemalan border and wrote: “Thank you Mexico, we look forward to working with you!”
Two busloads of those police were visible on the Mexican side of the bridge from Tecun Uman Thursday. Metal barricades were stored to one side, but not yet deployed.
Edgar Corzo of Mexico’s National Human Rights Commission expressed concern about the police deployment in Ciudad Hidalgo.
“We hope that the immigration officials and federal police have a humanitarian understanding,” Corzo said. He said they were “worried that things could escape rational margins.”
Mexico’s southern border is notoriously porous and it was unclear how many of the migrants would attempt to cross legally at the bridge.
Some migrants crossed the river at a point where they could walk through shallow water Thursday, Corzo said. Others could opt for the rafts that ferry people — and historically migrants — daily across the river.
“How they’re going to cross is what we’re anxious about,” he said.
Tensions rose Thursday when an immigration activist who led a migrant caravan through Mexico last spring was arrested by federal police and immigration agents in Ciudad Hidalgo on the Mexican side of the border.
Irineo Mujica’s organization, Pueblo sin Fronteras or People without Borders, said he was detained during a peaceful march. Video circulating on social media saw several police and immigration agents pushing Mujica into an immigration agency van in a crowd of people. Mujica appeared to be resisting.
Corzo said police accused Mujica of slashing the tires of an immigration vehicle. Immigration officials said later in a statement that Mujica, who has dual U.S.-Mexican citizenship, is accused of property damage. It said Mujica attacked immigration agents, as well as local and federal police, after he was asked for his identification.
Mexico has said the Hondurans would not be allowed to enter as a group and would either have to show a passport and visa — something few have — or apply individually for refugee status, a process that can mean waiting for up to 90 days for approval. They also said migrants caught without papers would be deported.
In April, Mexican immigration officials had some success in dispersing the smaller caravan by processing many who decided to seek refugee status in Mexico, but some did continue on to the U.S. border where they were processed over several days.
Three weeks before U.S. midterm elections, Trump has seized on the caravan as a political winner for Republicans.
Early Thursday he tweeted: “I must, in the strongest of terms, ask Mexico to stop this onslaught — and if unable to do so I will call up the U.S. Military and CLOSE OUR SOUTHERN BORDER!” Trump tweeted, adding that he blamed Democrats for what he called “weak laws!”
Marcelo Ebrard, who is set to become foreign relations secretary when President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador takes office Dec. 1, said Trump’s tweets need to be understood in the context of the upcoming U.S. midterm elections.
“The electoral process is very near, so he is making a political calculation,” Ebrard said in an interview with Radio Centro.
Trump’s stance, he said, was “what he has always presented,” adding he saw “nothing surprising in it.”
Current Foreign Relations Secretary Luis Videgaray was also sanguine and viewed things through the lens of U.S. politics.
“Nobody likes them (Trump’s comments). There’s no reason to give them greater transcendence or importance,” Videgaray said from the United Nations where he sought the world body’s help processing asylum requests from the migrants. “What is important to us is the migrants, respect for human rights, their due protection, particularly the most vulnerable.”
Like Guatemala and Honduras, Mexico is a country of many migrants, raising the question of whether the political will exists for a confrontation.
Lopez Obrador wants to avoid repression against migrants and also to avoid angering the United States. He said this week that Mexico would offer jobs to Central Americans.
“Anyone who wants to work in our country … will have a work visa,” he said.
Juan Escobar, 24, said he had heard about Trump’s comments but said they would not dissuade the migrants from continuing their journey.
“Only God on high can stop us,” Escobar said."
https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/u-s-pastor-andrew-brunson-released-from-house-arrest-in-turkey,refugee,806,2018-10-12T17:57:07-04:00,"Zeynep Bilginsoy, Associated Press",U.S. pastor Andrew Brunson released from house arrest in Turkey,"IZMIR, Turkey — A Turkish court on Friday convicted an American pastor of terror links but released him from house arrest and allowed him to leave the country, removing a major irritant in fraught ties between two NATO allies that still disagree on a host of other issues.
The court near the western city of Izmir sentenced North Carolina native Andrew Brunson to just over three years in prison for allegedly helping terror groups, but let him go because the 50-year-old evangelical pastor had already spent nearly two years in detention. An earlier charge of espionage was dropped.
Hours later, Brunson was transported to Izmir’s airport and was flown out of Turkey, where he had lived for two decades. He was expected to be flown to the U.S. military hospital in Landstuhl, Germany.
“I love Jesus. I love Turkey,” an emotional Brunson, who had maintained he was innocent of all charges, told the court during Friday’s hearing. He tearfully hugged his wife Norine Lyn as he awaited the court decision.
“PASTOR BRUNSON JUST RELEASED. WILL BE HOME SOON!” U.S. President Donald Trump tweeted after the American was driven out of a Turkish prison in a convoy. Later, after Brunson was airborne, Trump told reporters the pastor had “suffered greatly” but was in “very good shape,” and that he would meet with him at the Oval Office on Saturday.
Brunson’s release was a diplomatic triumph for Trump, who is counting on the support of evangelical Christians for Republican candidates ahead of congressional elections in November.
It could also benefit Turkey, allowing the government to focus on an escalating diplomatic crisis over Jamal Khashoggi, a Saudi contributor to The Washington Post who went missing more than a week ago and is feared dead after entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. Turkish officials suspect Khashoggi was killed in the consulate; Saudi officials deny it.
Additionally, Turkey could now hope that the U.S. will lift tariffs on Turkish steel and aluminum imports, injecting some confidence into an economy rattled by high inflation and a mountain of foreign currency debt.
Friday’s ruling followed witness testimony that seemed to partly undermine the prosecutor’s allegations and highlighted concerns that Turkey had been using the U.S. citizen as diplomatic leverage. Turkey bristled at suggestions that its judicial system is a foreign policy instrument, and has accused the U.S. of trying to bend Turkish courts to its will with tariffs in August that helped to send the Turkish currency into freefall.
Brunson’s release doesn’t resolve disagreements over U.S. support for Kurdish fighters in Syria, as well as a plan by Turkey to buy Russian missiles. Turkey is also frustrated by the refusal of the U.S. to extradite Fethullah Gulen, a Pennsylvania-based Muslim cleric accused by Turkey of engineering a 2016 coup attempt.
The court dropped an espionage charge against Brunson, who had faced up to 35 years in jail if convicted of all the charges against him. He was among tens of thousands of people, mostly Turks, who were caught up in a government crackdown after the failed coup.
He was accused of committing crimes on behalf of Gulen as well as Kurdish militants who have been fighting the Turkish state for decades.
Earlier, the court called two witnesses following tips from witness Levent Kalkan, who at the previous hearing had accused Brunson of aiding terror groups. The new witnesses did not confirm Kalkan’s accusations. Another witness for the prosecution said she did not know Brunson.
Brunson again denied accusations that his church aided Kurdish militants, saying he had handed over a list of Syrian refugees whom the congregation had helped and adding that Turkish authorities would have identified any terrorists.
“We helped everyone, Kurds, Arabs, without showing any discrimination,” he said.
The pastor, who is originally from Black Mountain, North Carolina, was imprisoned for nearly two years after being detained in October 2016. He was formally arrested in December of that year and placed under house arrest on July 25 for health reasons.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan had resisted U.S. demands for Brunson’s release, insisting that the courts are independent. But he had previously suggested a possible swap involving Brunson and Gulen, who denied he organized the coup attempt.
Other witnesses had not yet testified in Brunson’s case and evidence was still not complete, suggesting a rushed effort to resolve the case.
Brunson led a small congregation in the Izmir Resurrection Church. The U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom, with top representative Tony Perkins monitoring the trial, had listed him as a “prisoner of conscience.”
While supporters in the United States celebrated Brunson’s release, his case overshadowed the predicament of a Turkish-American scientist from NASA and several Turkish workers for the U.S. diplomatic mission who were arrested in Turkey.

Ambassador Nikki Haley abruptly announced she is resigning at the end of the year, raising questions about who will fill the key national security post and about the outspoken diplomat’s own political ambitions.
Trump later told reporters he was considering five candidates for Haley’s job, and that a successor would be named in two to three weeks — or maybe sooner.
Among those under consideration, Trump said, is former deputy national security adviser Dina Powell. The Goldman Sachs executive and former Bush administration official is a close ally of Trump’s daughter Ivanka Trump and son-in-law, Jared Kushner — both senior White House aides.
The news of Haley’s departure blindsided some key U.S. allies and many congressional Republicans involved in foreign policy matters. And it came less than a month before congressional elections, thwarting White House efforts to project an image of stability, with the loss of one of the highest-profile women in the administration at a time when women’s votes are being vigorously pursued.
But Haley, the first female governor of South Carolina, has often been an unpredictable and independent force in the Trump administration. At times she has offered strikingly different perspectives on world events from her more isolationist-minded boss.

A smiling Haley announced her decision at an Oval Office meeting alongside the president, bringing up her own political prospects even as she underscored her continued support for Trump. Without prompting from reporters, she said she had no plans to run for president “in 2020” and would campaign for Trump.
Trump told reporters that he has heard Ivanka Trump’s name discussed for the post, adding she’d be “incredible,” but said if he selected her he’d be accused of nepotism.
In a tweet, the presidential senior adviser praised Haley, saying Trump will “nominate a formidable replacement for Ambassador.” She added: “That replacement will not be me.”
U.S. Ambassador to Germany Richard Grenell’s name has also been floated for the post, but Trump suggested he’d rather keep him in his current post “because he’s doing such a good job.”
Haley, who is 46 and not personally wealthy, hinted in her resignation letter to Trump that she is headed to the private sector. She has one child in college and another approaching college age, and she has the potential to make much more money in the business world.
“I have given everything I’ve got these last eight years,” she said, referring to her six years as governor as well as her time at the U.N. “And I do think it’s good to rotate in other people who can put that same energy and power into it.”
White House officials had sought to put a hold on Trump’s record-setting turnover in the run-up to the Nov. 6 elections, with aides being asked months ago to step down or commit to stay through Election Day to avoid adding to a sense of turmoil.
The prospect of post-midterm changes continues to hang over the West Wing, and Haley’s exit was one that has been discussed, according to a senior administration official not authorized to publicly discuss private conversations.
A number of officials speculated that the timing was meant to preserve the ambassador’s own political future. A post in the Trump administration has proven to be a rickety stepping-stone to either lucrative private sector work or hopes for higher office, and the risk to those ambitions might only increase after the elections if Democrats make significant gains in Congress.
Trump said Haley first discussed leaving with him six months ago. The senior official noted that their conversation coincided with the appointments of Mike Pompeo as secretary of state and John Bolton as national security adviser in an earlier upending of top foreign policy officials. Haley had expressed some frustration that her voice had been diminished as the two men became the aggressive new faces of Trump’s international policy, the official said.
More recently, there was the awkward moment at the U.N., when Trump’s boasting of American economic strength under his leadership brought laughter at a General Assembly session. He insisted later that the delegates were laughing with him, not at him.
The six-month timeline also coincides with a high-profile spat between Haley and the White House in April, when she drew the president’s ire for previewing in a television appearance the administration’s planned imposition of a new round of sanctions on Russia. When the sanctions never materialized, White House officials said the plans had changed without Haley being briefed, and economic adviser Larry Kudlow suggested she was confused.
“I don’t get confused,” Haley said in a sharply worded response to the West Wing.
Haley was appointed to the U.N. post in November 2016 and last month coordinated Trump’s second trip to the United Nations, including his first time chairing the Security Council.
At the U.N., she helped spearhead the administration’s efforts to combat what it alleged to be anti-American and anti-Israel actions by the international body, including the U.S. decision to leave the Human Rights Council and to stop funding the U.N. agency for Palestinian Refugees.
Haley also secured three successively tougher Security Council sanction resolutions against North Korea — which the administration has credited with bringing Kim Jong Un to the negotiating table — and an arms embargo against South Sudan. But under Haley’s tenure at the U.N., the U.S. has faced strong opposition from Russia when it comes to addressing the 7-year-old war in Syria, and frustration from European allies over reimposing nuclear sanctions against Iran.

https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/interpol-president-reported-missing-during-visit-to-china,refugee,770,2018-10-05T18:27:31-04:00,"Elaine Ganley, Associated Press",Interpol president reported missing during visit to China,"PARIS — He left his home in Lyon, France, for a visit to his homeland, and then vanished — putting the International Criminal Police Organization, best known as Interpol, at the center of its own missing persons case.
Meng Hongwei, Interpol’s president, boarded a plane and arrived in China, according to a French judicial official. But then, nothing. His wife, who put out a call on Friday, said she hasn’t heard from her 64-year-old husband since the end of September, the official said.
To make matters murkier, Meng is not just the head of Interpol: He’s also a vice minister for public safety in China.
Interpol, based in Lyon, would say only that reports that its president is missing is “a matter for the relevant authorities in both France and China.”
France launched its own investigation on Friday morning, according to the judicial official who wasn’t authorized to speak publicly and asked for anonymity.
Whether China was taking action was unknown. But the South China Morning Post, a Hong Kong newspaper, hinted that Meng may have been the latest target of an ongoing campaign against corruption in China.
The newspaper said that upon landing last week Meng was “taken away” for questioning by what it said were “discipline authorities.” The term usually describes investigators in the ruling Communist Party who probe graft and political disloyalty. The Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, the party’s secretive internal investigation agency, had no announcements on its website about Meng and could not be reached for comment.
Meng is the first from his country to serve as Interpol’s president, a post that is largely symbolic but powerful in status and not without political weight. But because Interpol’s secretary general is responsible for the day-to-day running of the police agency’s operations, Meng’s absence may have little operational effect.
Far from being a Hollywood-style agency with agents toting weapons across the globe, Interpol is low-profile and discrete about its cases, unless it wants to talk.
The organization links up police officials of its 192 member states, who can use Interpol to disseminate their search for a fugitive, or a missing person. Only at the behest of a country does the information go public via a “red notice,” the closest thing to an international arrest warrant. “Yellow notices” are issued for missing persons.
But Interpol walks a fine line between its noble mission — facilitating international police cooperation — and the politics and policies of some of its member countries.
Meng’s appointment as president in 2016 — amid Chinese leader Xi Jinping’s sweeping anti-corruption drive — alarmed some human rights organizations, fearful it would embolden China to strike out at dissidents and refugees abroad.
Such actions would be contrary to Interpol’s mission statement: “Action is taken within the limits of existing laws in different countries and in the spirit of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.” It adds that “intervention or activities of a political, military, religious or racial character” are prohibited.
Meng has a shiny curriculum vita, having held down various positions within China’s security establishment, including as a vice minister of public security — the national police force — since 2004. In the meantime, he served as head and deputy head of branches of the coast guard, all while holding positions at Interpol. His term in Lyon runs until 2020.
His duties in China would have put him in close proximity to former leaders, some who had fallen afoul of Xi’s campaign. He likely dealt extensively with former security chief Zhou Yongkang, now serving a life sentence for corruption.
Xi has placed a premium on getting officials and businesspeople accused of fraud and corruption to return from abroad, making Meng’s position even more sensitive.
The anti-corruption drive recently drew headlines after the disappearance three months ago of “X-Men” star Fan Bingbing, one of the country’s best-known actresses.
Her whereabouts remain unknown. But on Thursday, Chinese tax authorities spoke publicly about her disappearance public, ordering her and companies she represents to pay taxes and penalties totaling $130 million. Fan is being fined around $70 million personally for tax evasion. Still out of the public eye, she issued a statement apologizing for her actions.
China, in the midst of a weeklong holiday, offered no comment on Meng’s disappearance.
In France, there were only questions.
The French are “obviously aware of the disappearance but know nothing more at this stage,” said one diplomatic official, unauthorized to comment publicly on the matter and speaking only on condition of anonymity.

https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/officials-were-not-fully-prepared-to-handle-family-separations-at-border-new-report-says,refugee,1322,2018-10-03T17:03:59-04:00,Joshua Barajas,"Officials were ‘not fully prepared’ to handle family separations at border, new report says","A government watchdog report made public confirms what many media outlets, immigration lawyers and advocates have said for months after the Trump administration rolled out its “zero tolerance” policy earlier this spring: Officials were not prepared.
At the top of its 25-page report, the Department of Homeland Security’s Inspector General Office said the agency was “not fully prepared to implement” the policy, which resulted in the separation of thousands of migrant children from their parents, nor was it prepared to “deal with some of its after-effects.”
After DHS officials started separating migrant families and transferring children to Department of Health and Human Services care, a result of the policy introduced in May, advocates and lawyers denounced the practice, saying it may have permanent, traumatic effects on the families. Some migrant parents, in personal declarations filed in court, also said they were coerced into signing away their reunification rights.
After President Donald Trump halted the practice of separating families with an executive order in June, reuniting eligible families became a court-imposed imperative for the federal government. Today, the majority of the more than 2,600 children separated from their families at the border have been reunited with their parents. But 136 migrant children remain separated, and advocates say reunited families will continue to grapple with long term emotional and psychological effects, the extent of which are not yet fully understood.
Here are some takeaways from the IG report and what’s next.
This resulted in “some parents not understanding that they would be separated from their children, and being unable to communicate with their children after separation,” the report said. This is in line with personal declarations filed by parents in court, saying they were given a handful of minutes to decide their family’s future or didn’t fully understand the implications of what they were being told to sign. Some representatives for these parents said the forms were in English and not Spanish, or, that parents weren’t given the opportunity to ask questions about the forms. Other parents said they didn’t trust the immigration officials so refrained from signing any documentation.
Other findings about communication:
When the administration rolled out its zero tolerance policy, it repeatedly stressed that asylum-seekers ought to enter the U.S. through official ports of entry; if they entered this way, asylum-seekers wouldn’t break the country’s immigration laws, official said. However, the report said U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agents used a technique called “metering” — a practice that has been used since 2016 — to limit the flow of people looking to enter the U.S. through those ports.
Here’s how it worked, according to the report: CBP processing facilities are a short distance from U.S. side of the border with Mexico. Normally, an asylum-seeker would cross the pedestrian footbridge linking the two countries. They would walk on U.S. soil to reach the CBP facility. While metering, CBP officers stood at the dividing line on the bridge and radioed in to see if there would be available space for the asylum-seeker when they arrived at the CBP office. The report said officers only allowed the asylum-seeker to cross the line unless there was space. Otherwise, they’d tell the individual that the port was at capacity. This “may have led to additional illegal border crossings,” the report said.
The IG team observed one port of entry attempting to make more space available at the facility, the report noted. But the team also saw evidence that metering led “some aliens who would otherwise seek legal entry into the United States to cross the border illegally.” One example the report cited: A woman said she tried illegally crossing into the U.S. after she was turned away by an officer on the bridge three times.
The PBS NewsHour’s Amna Nawaz saw first-hand how CBP officials stopped migrants at the international border, before they could cross in the U.S. to make an asylum claim. This was the NewsHour’s report from late June.
The IG report said this was because of limitations of the agency’s IT systems. This is partly because there’s not a “fully integrated” information system among all the U.S. agencies involved with immigration. This “made it difficult for DHS to reliably track separated parents and children,” the report said.
In media calls throughout the summer, when reporters had asked immigration officials about how they were tracking the separated families, there didn’t appear to be a formal process — or at least not one communicated to journalists. As a program coordinator for the immigrant rights group Kids in Need of Defense once described to The New Yorker, it would take days to just discern the location of a separated child.
Also, detailed information on separated families, including more specifics on all who were separated and the statuses of their cases, didn’t materialize for the public until a lawsuit was filed by the American Civil Liberties Union, leading a judge to order the data’s release.
A more notable finding by investigators: On June 23, DHS said it had a “central database” that had location information on the separated families. Investigators “found no evidence” of a database.
Under the policy, the agency held separated children for long periods in government-approved facilities that were “intended solely for short-term detention,” the report said.
U.S. immigration law stipulates that CBP is allowed to hold migrant children for up to 72 hours before they’re transferred to the care of the HHS Office of Refugee Resettlement. But CBP “exceeded the 72-hour period in many instances,” the report said.
In fact, 237 of 855 unaccompanied migrant children at facilities visited by investigators in June were detained for more than 72 hours after entering the U.S. between ports of entry, according to the report. One child, whose age isn’t given, was in custody for more than 280 hours, or about 12 days.
The report said that Border Patrol officials said there may have been delays on behalf of HHS to accept some of the children, or, delays in transportation. The report also said that CBP officials “may have inadvertently omitted critical information” in their child placement requests to HHS. For instance, at least two CBP officials recalled to investigators that HHS contacted them several times in a given day for missing information. The officials said it would have been helpful to have an HHS employe on site.
In response to the NewsHour, DHS said in a statement that the IG report’s findings “illustrate the difficulties in enforcing immigration laws that are broken and poorly written.”
The statement continued: “The report fails to understand where the Zero Tolerance Policy took effect: in between the ports of entry. CBP has and will continue to accept and process claims of credible fear at the ports of entry in addition to protecting the safety and security [of] American communities from nefarious actors and drugs. This administration will no longer turn a blind eye to illegal immigration and will continue to refer illegal border crossers for prosecution. We are committed to enforcing the rule of law and ensuring that there are consequences for illegal actions.”
After the report was released, Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois tweeted that its findings showed that the “humanitarian crisis that resulted was not only predictable, but apparently orchestrated.” He then called on Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen to resign, a move he has made before.
“It is completely unacceptable that no one in the Trump Administration has been held accountable for the humanitarian crisis created by its family separation policy,” he later tweeted.
The report stops short of recommending corrective action.
The IG said the report was meant to “highlight issues” behind the administration’s handling of separated families and that it anticipated a “more in-depth review” into some of the listed issues in the future. It’s unclear what timeline the IG intends to follow up on this report.

https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/we-began-to-film-secretly-in-libya-then-we-had-to-escape,refugee,1134,2018-10-02T12:26:29-04:00,Christopher Livesay,We began to film secretly in Libya. Then we had to escape,"We knew Libya would be tough. We set out to report on the re-emergence of the Islamic State group and the immigration crisis. The latter was particularly sensitive, since last November when CNN broadcast shocking video of slave auctions selling African migrants outside Tripoli. The Libyan government opened an investigation into the auctions but also blocked all American TV outlets from entering the country.
We spent five months pushing Libyan authorities for visas and permits, and made repeated trips to Libyan embassies in Rome and London.
Finally we arrived in Tripoli in early August — typically high season for migrants trying to cross the Mediterranean into Europe. An estimated 700,000 are currently bottlenecked along the coast, trapped between abusive conditions in Libya and an increasingly populist, anti-migrant Europe that no longer wants them.
When we arrived at Mitiga airport in Tripoli, we were immediately met by a government minder named Anwar Al Mabruk Gamberi. The obstruction to our reporting was almost instant.
One morning, he refused to allow us to attend scheduled interviews in Sirte, the hometown of former Libyan strongman Muammar al-Qaddafi, and the former capital of the ISIS caliphate in Libya.
“Why,” we asked, “if we have the proper permits?” “Because I say so,” was his response. He and other minders — sometimes as many as three cars’ full — would never leave our side for the two weeks we spent in Libya.
That is until we had to flee.

A few days into our journey, it became clear our hard-earned filming permits were often meaningless. Detention centers slammed the door on us. Government employees at an airplane hangar, where migrants were being flown back to their home countries, threatened to take our cameras.
So we began filming in secret. Our best shot was on Fridays — holy days — the only time our minders would leave us alone so they could go to the mosque. It was a really risky move. We wanted to film the vast majority of migrants and refugees who do not live in detention centers, but in urban dwellings among the Libyan population. But in Tripoli, this meant going to the most dangerous parts of town. Right before we arrived in the Abu Salim neighborhood, a shootout took place between rival militias — some 22 operate in the city. If the government found out we were there, they’d certainly arrest us.
But that was where the story was. It was where battered migrants and refugees, who had crossed thousands of miles of Sahara Desert, endured torture, and even slavery, were now living in fear.
One young man in particular had lost his feet and fingers due to horrendous abuse from traffickers and Libyan authorities. Shortly after we parted ways, he called to tell us Libyan police had pistol-whipped him and taken $200 — money his fellow refugees had pooled to help him out, since he couldn’t work due to his condition. When we asked him why the police targeted him, he said it’s because they knew he was helpless. “I’m a black migrant. This is Libya,” he added.
Then, violence broke out in the streets of Tripoli. Some 60 people would be killed in about one week. Our minders were becoming paranoid about our reporting. They threatened to detain us and confiscate our footage.

That’s when we decided to flee Tripoli. We hired a car to pick us up in the middle of the night and take us to Misrata, a semi-autonomous city about three hours east of Tripoli, with an international airport known to be slightly outside the grip of the government. Neither of us will ever forget that black Kia sedan pulling up in front of our hotel. The driver flashed the headlights, the signal to load up and leave.
But we were spotted. Our minder, Anwar, called in a froth, swearing he would stop us at the first checkpoint and have us arrested. All we could do was keep driving up the coast, and wear our baseball caps low in a slapstick effort at hiding our Westernness.
Somehow we made it past the checkpoints and to Misrata. It was the last we saw of our minders. But not the last of our government harassment. We still had to wait three days for the next flight to Tunis, where we’d make connecting flights back home. On our first day in Misrata, Libyan intelligence officers caught up with us — polite men who apologized for our treatment. But their demeanor soon turned threatening.
In Misrata, we paid a local fixer to help us navigate our way out of the country. One morning, as we left the hotel, he spotted an ominous figure waiting for us. “Go back inside the hotel, lock the door,” our fixer said calmly.
As our fixer spoke to this unfriendly figure, we spent the next three hours hiding our videotape, and calling people who could help. Among them was a dear friend, Darren White, formerly with British special forces and now a security adviser with Ibex Risk Management (working this time only for gratitude). “It’s very likely they’re going to detain you,” he said. “Or worse, they could have you abducted by a hostile militia. It’s happened before.”
We also called the U.S. State Department and the United Nations, who volunteered to intervene on our behalf. When our fixer came back inside the hotel, he confirmed that the government did indeed plan to detain us. But after much work behind the scenes, they decided to let us go to the airport the next day. Darren still advised strict caution: “Leave the hotel under no circumstances until it’s time to fly.”
The next morning, we loaded into our fixer’s car and went to the airport. Taking no chances, Darren arranged for one of his local Libyan contacts to tail our car. “In case you get lifted, at least I’ll know which car took you.” Fortunately, we made it to the airport and out of the country without incident.
It was some of the hardest reporting each of us has ever encountered. If we could do it all over again, we would avoid Tripoli completely. The security risks are simply too great for freelance reporters, and the government obstruction is overwhelming. Locals in Tripoli are also incredibly shy of cameras, often hostile.
Given these challenges, we’re very proud of the important stories we were able to cover.
Their report from Libya, done with support from the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting, airs Tuesday on the PBS NewsHour. You can watch it here."
https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/palestinians-bury-7-killed-by-israeli-troops-in-gaza-strip,refugee,1048,2018-09-29T12:36:09-04:00,"Fares Akram, Associated Press",Palestinians bury 7 killed by Israeli troops in Gaza Strip,"KHAN YOUNIS, Gaza Strip — Thousands of Gazans on Saturday thronged the funerals of seven people killed by Israeli troops during mass protests the previous day, chanting anti-Israel and anti-U.S. slogans and calling for revenge.
The coastal strip’s ruling Hamas militant group, meanwhile, dispatched a delegation to Egypt in a desperate new attempt to ease a crippling blockade on the Palestinian territory.
Friday’s violence was the deadliest day of protests in nearly four months. Among the dead was an 11-year-old boy, believed to be the youngest of 144 Palestinians killed by Israeli fire during the protests. Another boy, a 14-year-old, was also among the seven killed.
The Hamas-orchestrated protests were launched last March in large part to press for an end to the blockade, imposed by Israel and Egypt after the Islamic militant group took control of Gaza in 2007. The blockade has ravaged Gaza’s economy, and with Egyptian-mediated cease-fire efforts deadlocked, Hamas has vowed to step up the protests.

Israel, which has fought three wars against Hamas, accuses the group of exploiting and endangering civilians by using the protests as cover for militant actions.
Responding to calls by Hamas, thousands of Gazans participated in Friday’s protests, burning tires and using the billowing thick smoke as a screen to hurl rocks and firebombs toward Israeli forces on the other side of the fence.
At one location in east Gaza City, where four of the seven were killed, hundreds of protesters breached the fence. Amateur videos showed them kneeling down and kissing the ground on the Israeli side as gunfire could be heard. Others posed on the fence, urging protesters to follow. The protesters were seen cutting through the fence and damaging it.
It’s unclear how long they managed to stay on the Israeli side of the fence.
The Israeli army said the protesters damaged security infrastructure and threw more than 100 explosives. No soldiers were hurt. The Palestinian Health Ministry reported 90 people were wounded by live fire, and seven killed.
About 1,000 mourners attended the funeral of the 11-year-old victim, Nasser Musabeh, whose body was wrapped in a white shroud and carried on an orange stretcher. In an ancient Islamic custom, bundles of basil were thrown on the coffin.

Nasser was the brother of Duaa Musabeh, an 18-year-old volunteer paramedic who attends the weekly protests in the southern town of Khan Younis to treat the wounded. She said she would take her brother with her each week, ordering him to stay back in a safer space, about 300 meters (yards) from the fence where crowds typically gather.
Believing he was in a safe area, she approached the fence to help evacuate wounded protesters. But when she returned after dark, her brother was missing. As she frantically searched for him, a man showed her a picture of a dead boy released by a nearby hospital that was trying to identify him. Nasser had been shot in the head.
“I did not believe it. I felt unable to move an inch, I fell on the ground,” she murmured slowly.
According to al-Mezan, a Gaza-based human rights group, Nasser is the youngest person killed by Israeli army gunfire in the protests. Another 11-year-old boy was killed earlier this month under unclear circumstances, by a blunt object.

Israel says it is defending its border and in a statement, accused Hamas of exploiting and endangering children by sending them to the fence “as a cover for terror activity.” The military released videos showing protesters hurling flaming tires and cutting the border fence with wire cutters.
“Hamas is responsible for the violence riots and their consequences,” the army said.
But Israel has come under heavy international criticism for what many say is excessive use of force and the high death toll among unarmed protesters.
The top U.N. humanitarian official in the region, Jamie McGoldrick, said Saturday that he was “deeply saddened” by the loss of life, urging both sides to ensure children are not the target of violence or put at risk.
The 11-year blockade has made conditions increasingly dire in Gaza. Unemployment has risen to over 50 percent, residents receive just several hours of electricity each day and with few exceptions, Gazans cannot travel abroad.
Egypt, a frequent mediator between Israel and Hamas, has hosted several months of talks aimed at forging a cease-fire that would ease the blockade. But those talks appear to have made little progress, putting heavy pressure on Hamas as it deals with an increasingly frustrated public.
Hamas has blamed Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, who governs part of the West Bank and who has demanded Hamas return control of Gaza to him, of thwarting the efforts. The deadlock also has complicated President Donald Trump’s promised Middle East peace plan. The White House has not said when it will release the plan, which has little chance of success as long as Gaza remains in turmoil.
Earlier this month, Hamas began accelerating the protests, holding them nearly on a daily basis in an attempt to draw attention to the plight of Gazans. Hazem Qassem, a Hamas spokesman, said Saturday that the marches “will continue to diversify and expand until breaking the siege.”
At a speech in the United Nations on Thursday, Abbas threatened more measures to force Hamas into surrendering control of Gaza. Hamas fears this may include more pay cuts to former Palestinian Authority employees in the territory and reductions in services to Gaza, making it further difficult for Hamas to rule the strip.
But on Saturday, Hamas sent four senior officials to Egypt for a renewed round of discussions.
Hussam Badran, a politburo member of the militant group, said the officials, whom he did not identify, will work on “lifting the suffering on our people in Gaza as an urgent mission.”"
https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/palestinian-leader-our-rights-are-not-up-for-bargaining,refugee,1172,2018-09-27T13:34:02-04:00,"Jennifer Peltz, Associated Press",Palestinian leader: Our ‘rights are not up for bargaining’,"UNITED NATIONS — Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas declared Thursday that his people’s rights “are not up for bargaining” and he accused the U.S. of undermining the two-state solution, a day after President Donald Trump suggested for the first time in office that he “liked” the long-discussed idea as the most effective way to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
Abbas halted ties with Trump’s administration in December after the U.S. recognized contested Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, and Palestinians have said a pending U.S. peace plan will be dead on arrival because of that and other recent U.S. moves that Palestinians see as favoring Israel.
“Jerusalem is not for sale,” Abbas said to applause as he began his speech at the annual U.N. General Assembly. “The Palestinian people’s rights are not up for bargaining.”
He said Palestinians would never reject negotiation, but that “it’s really ironic that the American administration still talks about what they call the ‘deal of the century.'”
“What is left for this administration to give to the Palestinian people?” he asked. “What is left as a political solution?”
Added Abbas: “We are not redundant. Why are we treated as redundant people who should be gotten rid of?”

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was to address the world leaders later Thursday. The speeches fell on the same day that members of a vast U.N. developing-countries group formalized their decision to give the Palestinians the chairmanship in 2019. Although known as the Group of 77, it promotes the interests of 135 developing nations.
The Palestinians’ upcoming chairmanship stands to boost their aspirations for official statehood but angers Israel.
Trump made his comment about the two-state solution while meeting with Netanyahu on Wednesday. The U.S. president told reporters he believes that two states — Israel and one for the Palestinians — “works best.” He has been vague on the topic, suggesting he would support whatever the parties might agree to, a message he also recapped Wednesday.
“If the Israelis and Palestinians want one state, that’s OK with me. If they want two states, that’s OK with me. I’m happy if they’re happy,” he said.
Hours before Netanyahu’s scheduled speech, Israeli Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman expressed indifference to Trump’s remarks, saying that the Israeli interest is “a safe Jewish state.”
A Palestinian state “simply doesn’t interest me,” Lieberman said.

Netanyahu had reluctantly accepted the concept of Palestinian statehood but has since backtracked. A top coalition partner is threatening to topple his government if it returns to the agenda.
The two sides in one of the world’s most high-profile and volatile conflicts are always forceful voices at the U.N. and its annual General Assembly, but their leaders are speaking after a particularly eventful year in their relations.
The Islamic militant group Hamas that rules Gaza has led protests for months along the border with Israel, aiming partly to draw attention to the Israeli-Egyptian blockade imposed after Hamas took control of Gaza in 2007.
At least 137 Palestinians, mostly unarmed, have been killed by Israeli fire since the border protests began on March 30. During that time, a Gaza sniper killed an Israeli soldier.
Hamas and Israel came close to serious conflict earlier this summer as violence soared along the border. Gaza militants bombarded southern Israel with mortars and rockets, and Israel struck Hamas targets in Gaza.
Israel says it is defending its border against attempts by Hamas, a militant group sworn to its destruction, to infiltrate and carry out attacks. But Israel has faced heavy international criticism over the large number of unarmed protesters who have been killed or wounded.
Israel has also been struggling to deal with near-daily fires caused by kites and balloons rigged with incendiary devices launched by Palestinians in Gaza. The blazes have destroyed forests, burned crops and killed wildlife.
Egyptian mediated cease-fire talks have hit a deadlock, and Hamas is now intensifying its campaign with more protests.
Palestinians were infuriated, and many Israelis were thrilled, by a series of decisions Trump has made within the last year, starting with his recognition of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital. The Palestinians also claim the holy city as the capital of an eventual state. Earlier this year, Trump followed up on the recognition by moving the U.S. Embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, a step that was widely protested by Palestinians and others in the Arab world.
His administration has also slashed aid to the Palestinians by hundreds of millions of dollars and ended U.S. support for the U.N. agency that helps Palestinian refugees.
Trump and his national security team have defended their position, saying that decades of attempts to forge Israeli-Palestinian peace have failed.
The World Bank warned Tuesday that Gaza’s economy is in “free fall,” with a 6 percent contraction in the first quarter of this year and unemployment standing at over 50 percent. A report from the bank urged Israel and the international community to take action to avoid “immediate collapse.”
It attributed the downturn to a combination of factors, including Israel’s decade-long blockade of the Hamas-controlled territory, budget cuts by the rival Palestinian Authority and a reduction in international aid, particularly from the U.S.
Other leaders who spoke at the General Assembly Thursday included Haiti’s President Jovenel Moise, who told the gathered leaders he had “spared no effort to ensure that institutions are stable and to make sure we are creating a safe and stable enviro conducive to investment and to relaunching growth” in his country since the U.N. peacekeeping mission there wrapped up in October 2017.
The mission had helped the most impoverished country in the Western Hemisphere through 13 years of political turmoil and natural catastrophe. It has been followed by a new “stabilization” mission made up of about 1,300 international civilian police officers, along with 350 civilians tasked with helping Haiti reform its justice system.
The Caribbean island country continues to face economic and environmental challenges, including its vulnerability to natural disasters. It suffered heavy blows from a devastating 2010 earthquake and Hurricane Matthew in 2016.
Earlier, Lithuania’s president assailed world leaders for being “too quiet, too passive, too ignorant” in the face of abuses, corruption and inequality, and took a dig at Trump’s America-first vision.
“We cannot let the voice of nationalism and division win over dialogue and cooperation,” said Lithuanian President Dalia Grybauskaite.
Much of the attention at the international community’s most prominent gathering has been focused on Trump, whose brash behavior and boastful address on Tuesday provoked laughter and headshakes from other leaders. On Wednesday, he chaired a Security Council meeting on nonproliferation of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons and fired off more tough words at Iran.
Trump also made waves by accusing China of meddling in November’s U.S. elections. China denies any interference.

He has been stymied at every turn.
The Florida landscaping worker took the bold step of going to a government office to submit fingerprints and other documents required for immigrants to get their children out of government custody — and are now being shared with deportation agents. He was then told that the woman he rents a room from would also need to submit fingerprints, something she refused to do. He then sought out friends who are here legally to help him out, to no avail.
“I don’t know what to do,” said Tabora, an immigrant from Honduras who has lived more than a decade in the shadows without being detected. “My daughter is desperate, crying. She wants to get out of there.”
The drama of parents being separated from their children at the border dominated the headlines this year, but thousands of immigrant families are experiencing a similar frustration: the increasing hurdles they must surmount to take custody of sons, daughters and relatives who crossed the border on their own.
The Trump administration has imposed more stringent rules and vetting for family members to get these children back as part of an across-the-board hardening of immigration policy.
As a result, family members are struggling to comply with the new requirement, keeping children in detention longer and helping the number of migrant kids in government custody soar to the highest levels ever. Federal officials insist the policies are about ensuring the safety of children.
More than 12,000 children are now in government shelters, compared with 2,400 in May 2017. The average length that children spend in detention has increased from 40 days in fiscal year 2016 to 59 in fiscal year 2018, according to federal data.
The requirements include the submission of fingerprints by all adults in the household where a migrant child will live. These sponsors — the term the U.S. uses for adults who take custody of immigrant children — are also subject to more background checks, proofs of income and home visits, lawyers say.
And this information is now be shared with Immigration and Customs Enforcement — something that did not occur in the past. ICE said this week that the agency has arrested 41 sponsors since the agencies started sharing information in June.
Lawyers and advocates say that change has had a chilling effect because many family members live in the country illegally and have been deterred from claiming relatives for fear they will be deported.
“They are saying: ‘We are going after the people trying to take care of them (children),'” said Jen Podkul, director of policy at Kids in Need of Defense.

The government has long required families to go through some vetting to serve as sponsors. The issue has become more prevalent in the last five years when tens of thousands of unaccompanied children from El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras started coming across the border.
Since October 2014, the federal government has placed more than 150,000 unaccompanied minors with parents or other adult sponsors who are expected to care for the children and help them attend school while they seek legal status in immigration court.
Under Trump, the rules have been toughened in what the administration says are necessary steps to keep children from ending up in the homes of people with criminal records and other issues that could endanger kids.
“If somebody is unwilling to claim their child from custody because they’re concerned about their own immigration status, I think that de facto calls into question whether they’re an adequate sponsor and whether we should be releasing the child to that person,” Steven Wagner, acting assistant secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services’ Administration for Children and Families, said when the policy was announced in May.
The issue of sharing information with ICE arises because children and adults immigrants are handled by separate federal government agencies. Children are in the custody of the Health and Human Service Department’s Office of Refugee Resettlement, while adults are handled by ICE.
Until the new fingerprinting policy took effect, the government rarely shared such information with immigration officials unless a fingerprint match showed that a potential sponsor had a particularly alarming record, said Holly Cooper, co-director of the Immigration Law Clinic at the University of California Davis.
The tougher rules have put many immigrants in the position of doing something that once seemed unthinkable: turning over their fingerprints and other information knowing that it’ll be shared with ICE.
Marvin Puerto did just that to get custody of his 9-year-old son, Nahun. Puerto crossed the border in 2014 and has been trying to live in Missouri in the shadows since then. He and his wife, Eilyn Carbajal, waited two months to get custody of the boy.
“I did not want to do the fingerprints, but I had no choice”, said the 29-year-old construction worker. “Now they have all my information. I feel they are going to accuse me of smuggling family members.”
Workers at The Hispanic Interest Coalition of Alabama say that after the Office of Refugee Resettlement started sharing information with ICE in June, two to four sponsors a week did not show up for appointments and a few who did visit refused to get fingerprinted.
After the New York Civil Liberties Union sued in February on behalf of a detained Salvadoran teen and his mother, the government was required to release case files on 45 children held under similar circumstances. In about half a dozen of those cases, reluctance to provide fingerprints was a factor in holding up children’s release, forcing some sponsors to scramble for another place to live and others to drop out of the application process, the NYCLU said.
If unaccompanied minors are not placed with sponsors they can end up in a federal foster care program. Some could be deported to the same dangers from which they fled.
Many of the parents and other relatives trying to secure their children’s release are poor and, to cover expenses, often share homes with others who are unrelated or in the country illegally. Many of those roommates have been reluctant to submit their fingerprints.
For Adan, a 27-year-old Guatemalan living in south Florida, leaving his 17-year-old sister in detention was out of the question. He followed the process and was given custody of her. Now, he wants to leave his apartment.
“I feel I need to move to have a sense of security”, said the landscaper about ICE knowing where he lives. He did not provide a last name because of his immigration status.

The majority of migrant families separated as a result of the Trump administration’s “zero-tolerance” policy rolled out earlier this year are no longer in government custody, either because they were reunited by court orders or because children were placed with other sponsors in the U.S.
“It all seems to be very positive news,” U.S. District Court Judge Dana Sabraw, who has been overseeing the reunification effort, said at Friday’s hearing.
However, the Trump administration has deported more than 400 parents to their home countries without their children. To date, according to the latest status update Thursday, only 26 children from this group have been reunited.
Sabraw, who has previously said family separations were an issue of the government’s own making, said he expected the number of resolved cases from this group will continue to rise, as both parties work to determine whether the parents want to reunite with their children. (The government has identified more than 100 parents who do not wish to reunify).
The American Civil Liberties Union, which filed the lawsuit challenging the policy, has also pushed for greater attention to a handful of parents who have been barred from reunification with their children due to supposed “red flags” identified by the government.
At the end of Friday’s hearing, Sabraw said this case is on track to come “to some meaningful closure in the not-to-distant future.”
Here’s a look at what can happen next in the family reunification process.
The latest government data released Sept. 20 said that of the 2,654 separated migrant children, 2,151 have been “discharged,” meaning they were either reunified with their parents or released to another sponsor within the U.S. The government said 34 children have been discharged since last week’s update.
In the status update on Thursday, the government also said 182 children remain in government custody, under the care of Office of Refugee Resettlement, because their parents are deemed ineligible for reunification, or their cases are still under review, among other reasons. Here’s how the U.S. further breaks down this group:
There’s also another 220 children who are deemed no longer a part of the class-action lawsuit and remain in U.S. custody. This group includes:
Previously, the government said the new class of “unfit” parents who have been determined to pose a danger to their children was created following a final determination of each adult’s criminal history or fitness or the child’s safety. Both parties said they continue to meet and confer on the handful of affected cases.
In the last week’s status update, there were dozens of parents who were removed from the U.S. who haven’t been successfully reached by telephone using contact information provided by the government. The ACLU and its network have been continuing to make contact with these parents to determine their intent to reunify with their children.
The government suggested setting up three-way phone calls with remaining parents, ORR case managers and the ACLU. “Put simply, where parents may not always be responsive to other individuals, they are responsive to the ORR shelter programs,” the government said in last week’s status update.
This week, the government said that this shift to three-way calls has resulted in at least 15 successful attempts at reaching parents in their home countries. The U.S. anticipates continuing using this method to reach these remaining parents to determine their intent to reunify with their children or not.
The ACLU warned that there were several instances of “apparent communication breakdowns in the in-country reunification process.”
The organization said some parents, for example, weren’t informed of any changes to the travel plans and whereabouts for their child. As a result, the parents would travel a long way “only to have their child not arrive or where parents have not been given sufficient advance notice of an arriving child.” The child, the ACLU said, would then have to wait overnight or days before they’re finally reunified with their parent.
The ACLU requested that the government provide advance notice of the exact flight information and times related to each reunification planned in parents’ home countries.
For weeks, there have been negotiations between U.S. officials and attorneys representing a group of separated parents who claimed in past personal declarations that they were not properly given an opportunity to make their asylum claim.
In past personal declarations filed in court, some parents said the trauma of the separation impeded their ability to pass the “credible fear” step of the asylum process. Others said they were coerced or misled into signing a form that waived their reunification rights.
Both parties said Friday that they’re working on compiling lists of individuals who wish to go forward with the procedures under the agreement, which is expected to be formally approved by the judge in the coming weeks.
Sabraw wanted to set a deadline for the draft papers for the agreement by next Thursday. The government said that deadline could be possible, “but may be a little tight” and warned that more time may be needed.
In the meantime, no “credible fear” hearings have taken place for this new round of asylum attempts.
The agreement, which Sabraw hopes to approve soon, will allow more than 1,000 migrant parents another attempt at asylum.

The reporters, Wa Lone, 32, and Kyaw Soe Oo, 28, were each sentenced to 7 years in prison for violating the country’s Official Secrets Act, verdicts that received immediate condemnation from the international community.

The duo had been investigating the the deaths of Rohingya Muslims at the hands of Myanmar’s military when they were arrested in December. They were sentenced on Sept. 3 after they pleaded not guilty.
Wa Lone told the Myanmar court during a trial in July that a police officer had handed the unsolicited government documents to Kyaw Soe Oo and him just minutes before their arrests. He also said the officer had lied about the exchange during pre-court hearings.

On Sunday, some of the demonstrators, who Reuters reported were made up of youth activists and press freedom advocates, held banners in Burmese and English that called for the public’s right to information and a free press. Others chained themselves together and held signs or chanted demands for the journalists’ release.
“Losing press freedom means our democratic transition is going backwards,” one local journalist, Lun Zaung Htet, who helped organize the protest, told Reuters.

They issued calls to arms, urging young men to join in the defense of Idlib, the Syrian province where opposition fighters expect to make their last stand against Russian- and Iranian-backed government troops they have fought for years.
This time, it’s “surrender or die.”
As the decisive stand for their last stronghold looms, this motley crew of tens of thousands of opposition fighters, including some of the world’s most radical groups, is looking for ways to salvage whatever is possible of an armed rebellion that at one point in the seven-year conflict controlled more than half of the country.
In its last chapter, just as it has throughout the long, bloody war, the Syrian rebellion’s fate lies in foreign hands. This time, the splintered and diverse rebels have only Turkey.
“The whole world gave up on us, but Turkey will not,” said Capt. Nabij al-Mustafa, spokesman for the Turkish-backed umbrella group known as the National Front for Liberation.
Idlib, with its 3 million residents and more than 60,000 fighters, is Turkey’s cross to bear.

Ankara has appealed to Russia and Iran, its uneasy negotiating partners, for a diplomatic resolution to the ticking bomb. At the same time, it has sent reinforcements of its troops ringing Idlib, a move designed to ward off a ground assault, at least for now.
A wide offensive is only likely after a green light from Russia. But delicate diplomatic moves are at work. Moscow is keen on strengthening ties with Turkey, at a time when Ankara’s relations are at their lowest with the United States. Turkey, by calling on the United States and Europe for support, seems to be playing on that interest to pressure Russia to accept its proposals for a solution on Idlib that avoids an attack.
On Monday, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan meets for the second time in 10 days with Russia’s Vladimir Putin, this time in Sochi, Russia.
“After proving its influence in Syria and the Middle East, Russia wants to pull Turkey away from the West much more than achieve a military victory over the armed Syrian opposition,” Mustafa Ellabbad, an expert on Turkish-Arab relations, wrote in Kuwait’s al-Qabas newspaper.
The province, the size of Lebanon, has been the beating heart of the rebellion for years. In rebel hands since 2015, it is the largest contiguous territory they controlled. It has access to Turkish borders, securing supply lines for weapons, fighters and aid.
For the past two years, Idlib became the shoe-box into which were pushed an estimated 20,000 rebel fighters from around the country, after their losses to government troops and surrender deals negotiated with Russia and Damascus following devastating sieges. Civilians who refused to go back under government rule were also bussed there, nearly doubling the province’s population.

Among the estimated 60,000 opposition fighters in Idlib are at least 10,000 radicals affiliated with the al-Qaida-linked group, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (Arabic for Levant Liberation Committee). Thousands of foreign fighters, from China, Europe and the Middle East, are the backbone of the radical groups.
The Turkish reinforcements are going to 12 observation points that Ankara set up around Idlib last year under a deal with Russia and Iran creating a “de-escalation zone.” The deal also effectively stopped an earlier government advance and set Turkey up as Idlib’s protector.
Separately, Turkey has troops stationed in the enclave under its control north and east of Idlib, where it backs Syrian opposition fighters and a civilian administration. It is part of its plan to create a safe area along the border where some of the more than 3 million Syrian refugees it hosts may return.
Ankara initially sent in its troops more than two years ago to push out the Islamic State group and Syrian Kurdish fighters. For Ankara, the increasingly assertive, U.S.-backed Syrian Kurds were an existential threat that encourages the aspirations of its own Kurdish insurgents.
“In the mind of the rebellion, the hope is that from Turkish support they can have … a republic of northern Syria, protected by Turkey like Northern Cyprus,” said Fabrice Balanche, a Syria watcher at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy.
These Turkey-administered areas are likely to be the destination of the displaced and rebels of Idlib in case of an offensive.
An Idlib offensive holds multiple threats for Turkey right on its border — a humanitarian crisis, a security nightmare with thousands of gunmen loose and a defeat to its plans for the safe zone. If Syrian forces retake Idlib with no agreement on the fate of the opposition fighters, they could threaten the Turkey-controlled enclave, and Ankara would lose credibility with the fighters and leverage with Damascus on any future deal.
“There is really no way for the Syrian military and Damascus’ allies to launch a military offensive on Idlib that doesn’t have deeply negative, injurious effects on Turkey. There is no real way they can cushion this for Turkey,” said Sam Heller, a Syria expert in the Brussels-based International Crisis Group.
Turkey’s strategy in the opposition areas has been complicated by the presence of radical fighters. By backing the National Front, it argued it can draw fighters away from the al-Qaida-linked HTS, the dominant power in the province, forcing it to dissolve and creating a new opposition force ready to negotiate with the Syrian government.
The strategy has had limited success.
The National Front in recent months gained control of territory in Idlib from HTS, which still controls nearly 70 percent of the province. HTS began to show signs of splits and two weeks ago, Turkey declared it a terrorist group.
But with the onset of a military offensive, HTS has set up joint operation rooms with different National Front factions.
Making a rare video appearance in late August, HTS leader Abu Mohammed al-Golani — wearing an olive-green military uniform — vowed to fight Assad’s forces and said Turkish observation points were no protection.
The HTS spokesman in Idlib said now was not the time to talk about dissolving into Turkish-backed rebel groups. He underlined that an arrangement must eventually be made for the foreign fighters in the group.
“Right now, no sound is louder than that of the battle,” Imad Eddin Mujahed said. “We have many military surprises; enough to upset the balance and ward off aggressors.”
READ NEXT: Syria sets its sights on the last rebel holdout
In rallies around Idlib the last two weeks, protesters took to the streets to deny that the province is a hotbed of extremists. Thousands raised only the flag of the Syrian revolution, a reminder that there was once a popular uprising against Assad, and Idlib is now its last bastion.
Some raised banners reading: “The rebels are our hope and the Turks are our brothers.”
Syrian forces and Iranian-backed militias are likely to avoid a clash with the Turkish troops. But the stance of the Syrian government and Iran is clear-cut: They vow to recapture all Syrian territory and are loath to see an expansion of Turkish and American influence. They argue the West fueled jihadis with past support of the opposition and now must let Syria get rid of them.
“Assad and Russia gave the choice to the international community: First we kill everybody. Second thing, (they said) if you want to protect (Idlib) then take those people you think are nice … It is cynical but puts the international community before its contradictions,” said Balanche.
Al-Mustafa, the National Front spokesman, said the rebels are prepared for a battle he called “existential.”
But, he added, “our cause will not end if we lose this battle.”"

The second, an emergency one in May, helped ensure a historic meeting between North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and President Donald Trump came off.
Now, at his third summit with Kim next week in Pyongyang, South Korean President Moon Jae-in faces his toughest challenge yet: delivering something substantive that goes beyond previous vague statements on denuclearization and helps get U.S.-North Korea talks back on track.
Negotiations between Washington and Pyongyang have sputtered in recent weeks, raising doubts about whether Kim is truly willing to relinquish his nuclear arsenal and putting pressure on Moon to broker progress once again.
The result will likely be a crucial indicator of how the larger nuclear negotiations with the United States will proceed. Moon will try to get Kim to express more clearly that he’s prepared to abandon his nuclear weapons, which could create momentum for a second Kim-Trump summit.
Whether Moon succeeds, fails or falls somewhere in between, the third inter-Korean summit could help answer a persistent question: When Kim says he supports the “complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula,” what does he actually mean?
READ NEXT: Korean family reunions are a tenuous step toward progress
DENUCLEARIZATION DEBATE
Moon heads to Pyongyang on Tuesday facing lingering questions over his claim that Kim, during his conversations with South Korean officials, has privately expressed a genuine interest in dealing away his nuclear weapons and missiles.
The wave of optimism that surrounded the first two inter-Korean summits in April and May and the Singapore meeting between Trump and Kim in June conveniently overlooked disagreements about what exactly Kim had committed to.
“The third summit will bring more clarity to what North Korea means with the complete denuclearization of the peninsula,” said Kim Taewoo, former president of Seoul’s government-funded Korea Institute for National Unification. “If the North has been negotiating with goodwill all this time, Moon will be able to return with good results. But, regrettably, I see that possibility as low.”
He said it will be crucial for Moon to get Kim Jong Un to give a clearer signal that he is willing to accept credible actions toward denuclearization, such as providing a detailed description of North Korea’s nuclear program, a key first step toward inspecting and dismantling of it.
At his meetings with Moon and Trump, Kim signed statements pledging the complete denuclearization of the peninsula. But the North for decades has been pushing a concept of denuclearization that bears no resemblance to the American definition, vowing to pursue nuclear development until the United States removes its troops from South Korea and the nuclear umbrella defending South Korea and Japan.
The differences prompted Trump to cancel Secretary of State Mike Pompeo’s planned visit to North Korea last month. After an earlier Pompeo visit, Pyongyang accused Washington of making “unilateral and gangster-like” demands on denuclearization and bristled at the idea that it must take significant steps toward dismantling its nuclear program before a peace treaty is signed or international sanctions are lifted.
Moon, the son of North Korean war refugees, is eager to keep the nuclear diplomacy alive, not just to keep a lid on tensions, but also to advance his ambitious plans for engagement with the North, including joint economic projects and reconnecting inter-Korean roads and railways. These projects are held back by the sanctions against North Korea.
“What the South and North now needs is not just another joint declaration, but finding ways to substantially develop relations,” Moon said in a Cabinet meeting Tuesday. “We cannot cease our efforts to mediate and facilitate talks from the middle until dialogue and communication between North Korea and the United States flow smoothly.”
GETTING IT IN WRITING
The issue of declaring a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War will be high on the agenda in Pyongyang. The fighting stopped with an armistice that has left the peninsula technically at war.
Both Koreas are calling for a declaration by the end of the year, but the U.S. wants to see more concrete steps toward denuclearization first, and some analysts say a declaration could put pressure on the U.S. to withdraw its troops from South Korea.
“With the declaration, North Korea’s trying to put itself on equal footing with the United States so it could turn the process into a bilateral arms reduction negotiation between two nuclear states,” Kim, the security expert, said. “The process can’t have anything to do with a plan to denuclearize unilaterally.”
Chung Eui-yong, Moon’s national security adviser, met Kim in Pyongyang earlier this month, and said the North Korean leader told him that an end-of-war declaration would not weaken the U.S.-South Korea alliance or lead to a withdrawal of U.S. troops. Chung also said Kim wishes to realize denuclearization before the end of Trump’s first term.
Chung conveyed similarly promising comments from Kim after a previous visit in March, when South Korean officials shuttled between Pyongyang and Washington to set up the Trump-Kim meeting.
He said then that Kim had said the North would not need to keep its nuclear weapons if it received a credible security guarantee and that the North Korean leader understood that U.S.-South Korea joint military exercises must continue. The comments were seen as an important departure from North Korea’s previous stance.
But Kim has never made similar comments publicly or in writing.
If Moon can’t convince Kim to express a commitment to concrete denuclearization steps, he will at least have to get Kim to put the things Chung has said he was told in a written agreement, said Du Hyeogn Cha, a visiting scholar at Seoul’s Asan Institute for Policy Studies.
That would provide a starting point for establishing a timeline for denuclearization, reduce concerns over North Korea’s intent and make it clearer that the North bears the greater responsibility in the efforts to resolve the nuclear crisis, Cha said.
“The Panmunjom Declaration after the first summit only provided a time limit for the end-of-war declaration, which was the end of 2018; on denuclearization, the statement just said the Koreas would jointly work toward it,” Cha said. “A failure to get something more specific out of Kim could cause the diplomatic efforts to lose much of their force.”"

The United Nations said a major offensive by the Syrian regime and its allies in the northwestern province could be the “worst humanitarian disaster” of the 21st century, putting at risk more than 3 million people in Idlib and the surrounding areas.
On Saturday, Syrian helicopters reportedly bombed towns in southern Idlib, and the opposition accused Russia of carrying out airstrikes on hospitals and other civilian sites.
Panos Moumtzis, of the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, said four hospitals in the area were hit over the past few days. Fighting in the region has forced more than 30,000 people to flee to other parts of Syria so far, he said, adding that “the worst may be ahead of us.”

Last week, a meeting of key players in the Syrian war — Russia, Turkey and Iran — failed to produce a cease-fire to avoid a full-scale assault on Idlib. Turkey, which borders Syria, pushed for a truce because it already has 3.6 million Syrian refugees and no longer had the capacity to house any more. But Russian President Vladimir Putin said a cease-fire would be pointless since it wouldn’t involve Islamist militant groups that have entered the region. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said countering terrorism is an unavoidable part of the mission in Idlib and restoring peace to Syria.
The countries did issue a statement at the end of the summit saying there was no military solution and that the seven-year conflict could only end through a negotiated political process.
Will the current talks yield a political solution or will they be stymied by an offensive on Idlib? We spoke to several analysts.
The U.S., Britain, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Germany, France and Egypt are slated to participate in the United Nations-led talks, which will take place in Geneva on Sept. 14. The talks follow the summit between Russia, Turkey and Iran earlier this month.
The U.N. envoy for Syria, Staffan de Mistura, is trying to bridge the two parallel diplomatic tracks, known as Geneva and Astana, in order to bring together a consensus on moving forward on a constitutional committee, said Mona Yacoubian, a senior adviser for Syria, Middle East and North Africa at the U.S. Institute of Peace.
The Syria constitutional committee, once formed, would draft a new constitution and pave the way for new elections, which would be part of an eventual political settlement to the conflict, she said.
However, one questions that has dogged the discussions for years is who gets to participate from the Syrian opposition and whether they are genuine opposition members with constituencies within Syria, Yacoubian said. Typically, the negotiations have involved representatives from President Bashar al-Assad’s government and Syrian opposition. Western-backed Kurdish forces — who control vast swaths of Syria’s northeast — and extremist Islamist fighters have not been involved in mediation efforts.

Yacoubian said she didn’t hold much hope that the talks would yield anything immediately helpful to the situation on the ground. “I think the problem with the Geneva process is that it’s become increasingly moribund, increasingly detached from developments on the ground inside Syria,” she said.
Anne Barnard, a visiting fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations who covered much of the Syrian war as the New York Times’ Beirut bureau chief, noted that past Geneva talks have yielded few results, partly because Russia, Turkey and Iran appear to be the players with the most leverage on the ground in Syria.
“There hasn’t been any traction in recent years on negotiations,” Barnard said. “It’s all been about, can we even get these parties — the government and the opposition — in the room together.”
The question is whether Friday’s meeting in Geneva will tackle even minor reforms in Syria, “or is this basically going to put a stamp on a Syrian government victory,” she added.
Last month, the Trump administration announced a new team to lead its diplomatic efforts on Syria, headed by former Ambassador James Jeffrey, who served as envoy to both Iraq and Turkey. The delegation is also part of the broader effort to force the Islamic State group out of Syria.
“The conflict in Syria has continued for far too long,” Secretary of State Mike Pompeo tweeted on the day he swore in Jeffrey as the new representative for Syria engagement. The State Department will seek to forge a political solution, including constitutional reform and new elections under the U.N. resolution, Pompeo said.
The move indicates a renewed American effort on Syria, but only time will tell if the U.S. will be more specific “about what they’re willing to do and what kind of pressure will be put to bear on the Syrian government,” Barnard said.

The Syrian war has claimed an estimated 400,000 lives in its more than seven years, displaced about 6 million Syrians inside the country and forced another 5 million refugees into neighboring countries, according to the U.N. Over the years, key players have engaged in negotiations meant to help bring about an end to the war.
March 2011: Syrian civil war begins between Assad’s government and opposition forces as an offshoot of the Arab Spring uprisings across the Middle East and North Africa.
March 2012: U.N. special envoy Kofi Annan and the Arab League envoy to Syria submit a six-point plan to the U.N. Security Council that calls on all sides to stop fighting and work with the U.N. on an “inclusive Syrian-led political process.”
June 2012 — Geneva I: U.S., Russia and other leaders meet in Geneva and agree on a roadmap to peace that would create a transitional governing body to oversee new elections. Assad counters with his own peace plan in 2013, which the Syrian opposition rejects.
2014 — Geneva II: Another round of talks fail when the Syrian government and opposition groups cannot agree on terms. Assad wins presidential elections later that year. The last of Syria’s chemical weapons are shipped out of the country under a Russia-brokered deal.
2015 — Vienna process: The International Syria Support Group, made up of 20 members, meet in Vienna and establish a framework under which the Syrian government and opposition would enter U.N.-led negotiations. A U.N. Security Council resolution (2254) calls for the end of attacks on civilians, a new constitution and new elections within 18 months.
2016 — Geneva III: Talks are suspended when the government and opposition parties cannot agree on a release of prisoners and other humanitarian measures. Russia and Turkey broker a nationwide cease-fire between the Syrian government and opposition, but fighting eventually continues.
2017 — Geneva IV: The Syrian opposition and government hold indirect talks with Russia as a go-between. They end without a breakthrough, but with the promise of more negotiations.
2017 — Astana: Russia, Turkey and Iran begin a series of Astana talks — so named for their location in Kazakhstan. Twelve rebel factions and a Syrian government delegation also are involved. Russia, Turkey and Iran sign a memorandum establishing four “de-escalation zones” in Syria, but neither the Syrian government nor rebel groups sign it.
2017 — Geneva V-VIII: De Mistura, who is now the U.N. envoy for Syria, says all sides agree to the U.N. resolution for a political transition, but Geneva VI talks later collapse. Later in the year, Geneva VII and VIII talks end without a breakthrough."

Hungary called the vote fraudulent and vowed to challenge it.
The lawmakers voted 448-197 in favor of a report recommending the launch of a so-called Article 7 procedure, which could lead to the suspension of Hungary’s European Union voting rights.
It is the first time in EU history that the European Parliament had initiated and approved such a motion, which needed a two-thirds majority to pass and was approved by 69.4 percent of the lawmakers.
For years, Orban had been able to deflect much of the international condemnation thrown his way. Critics say that Hungary’s electoral system is disproportionate; media freedoms and judicial independence are dwindling; asylum-seekers and refugees are mistreated and there are limits placed on non-governmental organizations.
Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto, echoing Orban’s longtime position, called the Wednesday’s vote “petty revenge” against Hungary for its tough anti-migration policies.
“This decision condemning Hungary and the Hungarian people was made because we Hungarians have demonstrated that migration in not a necessary process and that migration can be stopped,” Szijjarto told reporters in Budapest.
WATCH: EU’s migrant compromise leaves many unanswered questions
He also claimed that the vote involved “massive fraud” since abstentions weren’t counted into the final tally, which made it easier to reach the needed majority.
There were 48 abstentions, so the 448 in favor exceeded the two-thirds needed only because it was based on 645 votes. If the abstentions were counted into the final tally, there would have been a total 693 votes, so the 448 in favor wouldn’t have reached two-thirds.
Szijjarto said Hungary was considering legal options to appeal the result because of the way the vote was tallied.
But Judith Sargentini, who presented the report prepared by the European Parliament’s Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, welcomed the outcome.
“Viktor Orban’s government has been leading the charge against European values by silencing independent media, replacing critical judges, and putting academia on a leash,” Sargentini said. “The Hungarian people deserve better. They deserve freedom of speech, non-discrimination, tolerance, justice and equality, all of which are enshrined in the European treaties.”
“This is a historic result for Hungarian citizens and for European citizens everywhere, that the European Parliament has voted by a large majority to stand up for the values we all hold dear,” Sargentini said.
Several non-governmental organizations targeted by the Orban government with restrictive rules — including a special tax on activities considered as promoting immigration and the criminalization of the aiding of asylum-seekers and refugees — also hailed the vote’s outcome.
“We welcome the European Parliament’s decision to defend the rule of law and confront the Hungarian government’s attempts to shut down civil society and independent voices in the media and academia,” said Heather Grabbe, director of the Open Society European Policy Institute. “MEPs across the political spectrum have taken a historic stand in defending the EU’s democratic values and the rights of its citizens.”
Grabbe’s organization is part of the Open Society Foundations set up by Hungarian-American billionaire and philanthropist George Soros, an ideological opponent of Orban and blamed by the Hungarian leader, along with the NGOs Soros supports, for promoting mass immigration into Europe. Soros has repeatedly denied the allegations.
The Hungarian Helsinki Committee, which offers legal aid to asylum seekers and refugees and has been a frequent target of Orban’s criticism, said that the EU vote “has made it clear that illiberal democracy is against the core values of the European Union.”
The move saw some members of the European People’s Party bloc — of which Orban’s Fidesz movement is a member — vote against their ally in Budapest.
Even EPP leader Mandred Weber, who earlier was supportive of Orban and is seeking to become the European Commission president next year, said he had voted for triggering Article 7.
“I have always been in favor of building bridges and I want to continue to do so, but yesterday (Tuesday) I didn’t see any readiness from the Hungarian PM to make a move towards his EU partners and address our concerns,” Manfred tweeted.
While Weber had called on Orban to show a willingness to compromise on some of the most high-profile issues — like an agreement being delayed by the Hungarian government for the Central European University, founded by Soros, to remain in Budapest and recent laws criminalizing the work of civic groups working with asylum-seekers and refugees — Orban remained steadfast that his policies wouldn’t change.
“I have nothing to compromise about since the questions they objected to were decided by the Hungarian people,” Orban said Tuesday in Strasbourg, France, after the debate in the European Parliament on the report on Hungary. “There is nothing to talk about.”
Orban, who was re-elected in April to his third consecutive term in office, fourth overall also said Tuesday that he expected lawmakers to approve the motion with the support of some EPP lawmakers.
“The order has arrived from Berlin and they will vote accordingly,” Orban said, in reference to German Chancellor Angela Merkel, whose governing Christian Democratic Union is the largest party in the EPP.
Orban has insisted that all of the criticism against his government is based on Hungary’s tough anti-immigration policies, which include fences built in 2015 on Hungary’s southern borders with Serbian and Croatia to divert the flow of migrants and very restrictive asylum rules."
https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/trump-administration-orders-closing-of-palestinian-office-in-washington,refugee,604,2018-09-10T13:25:15-04:00,"Ken Thomas, Associated Press",Trump administration orders closing of Palestinian office in Washington,"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration ordered the closure of the Palestinian diplomatic mission in Washington on Monday, citing the refusal of Palestinian leaders to enter into peace talks with Israel. The Palestinians accused the administration of dismantling decades of U.S. engagement with them.
The State Department said the U.S. step — the latest in a series targeting the Palestinians — came after a review of the office of the Palestine Liberation Organization centered on the fact that no “direct and meaningful negotiations with Israel” are underway despite previous warnings.
“To the contrary, PLO leadership has condemned a U.S. peace plan they have not yet seen and refused to engage with the U.S. government with respect to peace efforts and otherwise,” spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement. “As such, and reflecting congressional concerns, the administration has decided that the PLO office in Washington will close at this point.”
The Trump administration had told the Palestinians last November that closure could be expected unless they agreed to sit to down with the Israelis. The administration, however, has yet to release its own much-vaunted but largely unknown peace plan although it said it still intends to do so.
“The United States continues to believe that direct negotiations between the two parties are the only way forward,” Nauert said in her statement. “This action should not be exploited by those who seek to act as spoilers to distract from the imperative of reaching a peace agreement. We are not retreating from our efforts to achieve a lasting and comprehensive peace.”
She also said the closure decision was consistent with U.S. concerns about Palestinian attempts to prompt an investigation of Israel by the International Criminal Court.
National Security Adviser John Bolton was expected to address Monday’s decision in a speech later in the day focused on U.S. policy toward the ICC.
Palestinian official Saeb Erekat said the closure was “yet another affirmation of the Trump administration’s policy to collectively punish the Palestinian people, including by cutting financial support for humanitarian services including health and education.”
The Palestine Liberation Organization, commonly known as the PLO, formally represents all Palestinians. Although the U.S. does not recognize Palestinian statehood, the PLO has maintained in Washington a general delegation office that facilitates Palestinian officials’ interactions with the U.S. government.
The head of the PLO delegation to the U.S. accused the Trump administration of “dismantling decades of U.S. vision and engagement in Palestine.”
“Weaponizing humanitarian and developmental aid as political blackmail does not work,” Ambassador Husam Zomlot said.
Trump has delivered a number of blows to the Palestinians during his time in office.
Most recently his administration ended U.S. funding for the United Nations agency that helps Palestinian refugees, slashing hundreds of millions of dollars in aid for projects in the West Bank and Gaza and cutting funding to hospitals in Jerusalem that serve Palestinians.
Trump also recognized Jerusalem as Israel’s capital and moved the U.S. Embassy there, from Tel Aviv. Dozens of Palestinians were killed in protests that followed the move, and Palestinians have since rejected the U.S. as a peace broker.
Although the Israelis and Palestinians are not engaged in active, direct negotiations, Trump’s administration has been working to mediate a peace deal that would end the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Led by Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law and a senior aide, White House officials have been preparing a peace proposal they intend to put forward at an unspecified time.
Trump has promised to pursue the “ultimate deal” between the Palestinians and Israel. However, such a deal is unlikely given Palestinian mistrust of his administration.

The fatal stabbing of 35-year-old carpenter Daniel Hillig in the eastern city on Aug. 26 sparked a series of rallies, some of which erupted into violence. Protesters looked on as neo-Nazis performed the stiff-armed ‘Hitler salute,’ chanted “foreigners out” and harassed journalists covering the demonstrations.
“If one doesn’t think this way it would be good to draw a clear line and distance oneself from those who are doing that,” said government spokesman Steffen Seibert.
He echoed comments by Chemnitz mayor Barbara Ludwig, who told a rally in the city Saturday that people who repeatedly join protests by far-right extremists “strengthen the right-wing, violent scene.”
The tension that has built up over the past week in Chemnitz reflects the growing polarization over Germany’s ongoing efforts to come to terms with an influx of more than 1 million refugees and migrants to the country since 2015.
Authorities said a 22-year-old Iraqi and a 23-year-old Syrian have been arrested on suspicion of manslaughter in the Chemnitz killing
“If their guilt is proven then they will experience the full force of our laws,” said Seibert.
Thousands of people were expected to attend a free, open-air concert in the city Monday intended to send a signal against hatred and anti-migrant sentiment.
The concert, which is being promoted under the #WeAreMore hashtag, is part of an effort by German civil society to position itself against the growing far-right movement in parts of Germany.
Former Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel tweeted on Monday that “the far-right terror in Chemnitz is not a Saxon problem, it’s a German one.”
He harshly criticized the political establishment for being too passive when it comes to fighting far-right groups in Germany and asked them to make a stronger showing in places with simmering discontent and anti-migrant sentiment.
“I think it would be good if as many representatives as possible — not only in Chemnitz but everywhere — go to places where we think the citizens are not agreeing with our state,” he said.
But, Gabriel added, there was a clear line between angry citizens and those inciting people with hatred.
“We have to go with toughness after these terrorists,” he said in an interview with Bild Television, adding that “there won’t be any discussions with people who make the Hitler salute. There will only be the rigidity of the state.”
Gabriel called on the domestic intelligence service to start watching the Alternative for Germany, or AfD, party, which was voted into national parliament last year.
In the past, the nationalist AfD has officially distanced itself from radical far-right groups, but over the weekend it joined ranks for the first time with the more radical Patriotic Europeans Against the Islamization of the West, or PEGIDA, and Pro Chemnitz group and marched through the city together with them.
While Germany’s top security official, Horst Seehofer, has said there are no grounds to monitor Alternative for Germany, the state-level intelligence service in the northern city of Bremen said it is putting the party’s youth wing under observation.
Also on Monday, Hillig’s widow spoke out for the first time, saying that, “Daniel would have never wanted” the protests triggered by his killing.
“Daniel was neither left nor right,” the widow, identified only as Bianca T., told daily Bild adding that she was shocked by how the far right was exploiting his death. “I looked at the events on Saturday night — this was not about Daniel at all.”
“All we want to do right now is mourn him in peace,” she said.

That’s one of the key findings from a new UNHCR report about efforts to reach Europe. The report, titled “Desperate Journeys,” said that even though the number of crossings and deaths has plunged compared to recent years, the voyage is more deadly in percentage terms for those who venture across.
It said that 2,276 people died last year while trying to cross, or one death for every 42 arrivals.
This year, it’s 1,095 deaths, or one out of every 18 arrivals. In June alone, the proportion hit one death for every seven arrivals.
On the Central Mediterranean route so far this year, there have been 10 separate incidents in which 50 or more people died — most after departing from Libya. Seven of those incidents have been since June alone, UNHCR said.
“The reason the traffic has become more deadly is that the traffickers are taking more risk, because there is more surveillance exercised by the Libyan coast guards,” said Vincent Cochetel, UNHCR’s special envoy for the central Mediterranean. “They are trying to cut the costs: It costs them more to keep those people here longer in their warehouses, under captivity.”
Libyan authorities intercepted or rescued 18,400 people between August last year and July this year — a 38-percent increase from the same period of 2016 and 2017. Arrivals by sea from Libya to Europe plummeted 82 percent in those comparable periods, to 30,800 in the more recent one.
UNHCR says a growing worry these days is deaths on land by people trying to get to Libya in the first place, or getting stuck in squalid, overcrowded detention centers: Many get returned there after failing to cross by sea to Europe.
“The problems after disembarkation (is that) those people are sent back to detention centers, and many disappear,” Cochetel said. “Many are sold to militias, and to traffickers, and people employing them without paying them.”
He said the drop in departures means that traffickers attempt to “monetize their investment, which means they have to exploit more people. That results in more cases of slavery, forced labor, prostitution of those people — because they (smugglers) want to make money on those people.”
Would-be workers and migrants are still pouring into Libya: Some are fleeing injustice, abuse or autocrats in their home countries further south in Africa. Others are looking for work in the oil industry or agriculture.
“I think you have more deaths on land,” Cochetel said, referring to treks across the desert in Sudan, Algeria, Chad and Niger. “Many people in Libya are reporting having seeing people dead in the desert on the way to Libya.”
In Libya, instability continues even seven years after the fall of Moammar Gadhafi. French medical aid group Doctors Without Borders said Friday that fighting between rival militias in Tripoli, the capital, has endangered the lives of people trapped there and worsened humanitarian needs — especially at migrant detention centers.
Cochetel said Europe — where some countries have shown “appalling” squabbles about who would take in rescue ships carrying migrants — should look at the root causes of such journeys. European populations need to shun anti-migrant rhetoric and realize that figures are down sharply, and migrant flows are clearly manageable at current levels, he said.
“Europe has to show the lead, has to be exemplary in its response, but it’s quite clear that it’s already too late when the people are in Libya,” he said. “We need to work downstream in country of first asylum, in country of origin, and that takes time.”"
https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/un-team-says-myanmar-military-chiefs-should-face-genocide-case,refugee,988,2018-08-27T10:21:10-04:00,"Jamey Keaten, Associated Press",UN team says Myanmar military chiefs should face genocide case,"GENEVA — Investigators working for the U.N.’s top human rights body said Monday that Myanmar military leaders should be prosecuted for genocide against Rohingya Muslims, taking the unusual step of identifying six by name among those behind deadly, systematic crimes against the ethnic minority.
The call, accompanying a first report by the team of investigators, amounts to some of the strongest language yet from U.N. officials who have denounced alleged human rights violations in Myanmar since a bloody crackdown began last August.
The three-member “fact-finding mission” and their team, working under a mandate from the U.N.-backed Human Rights Council, meticulously assembled hundreds of accounts from expatriate Rohingya, as well as satellite footage and other information to assemble the report.
“The military’s contempt for human life, dignity and freedom — for international law in general — should be a cause of concern for the entire population of Myanmar, and to the international community as a whole,” said fact-finding mission chair Marzuki Darusman, a former Indonesian attorney-general, at a news conference.
The council created the mission in March last year — nearly six months before a string of deadly rebel attacks on security and police posts set off a crackdown that drove Rohingya to flee into neighboring Bangladesh. The U.N. estimates that more than 700,000 have fled.
The team compiled accounts of crimes including gang rape, the torching of hundreds of villages, enslavement, and killings of children — some before their eyes of their own parents. The team was not granted access to Myanmar and has decried a lack of cooperation or even response from the government, which received an early copy of the report.
The team cited a “conservative” estimate from aid group Reporters Without Borders that some 10,000 people were killed in the violence, but outside investigators have had no access to the affected regions — making a precise accounting elusive, if not impossible.
Above all, the investigators said the situation in Myanmar should be referred to the International Criminal Court, and if not, to a special tribunal. Last week, Myanmar’s government rejected any cooperation with the ICC, to which it is not a party. China, a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council with veto power over whether the issue will be brought before the ICC, has been reticent about condemning Myanmar’s government during the crisis.
U.N. leaders, foreign government officials, and human rights watchers have for months cited evidence of genocide in Myanmar, and the United States late last year said that “ethnic cleansing” was occurring in Myanmar. But few experts have studied the issue as in-depth, and in such an official way, as the fact-finding mission with a mandate from the 46-nation council.
The United Nations does not apply the word “genocide” lightly. The team’s assessment suggests the crimes against the Rohingya could meet the strict legal definition, used to highlight and condemn state-supported abuses in places like Bosnia, Rwanda and Sudan’s Darfur region.
Human rights watchers say that determining “genocidal intent” is perhaps the most difficult criteria to meet: In essence, it’s the task of assessing the mindsets of perpetrators to determine if ethnicity, race, religion or another attribute had motivated them.
“The crimes in Rakhine state, and the manner in which they were perpetrated, are similar in nature, gravity and scope to those that have allowed genocidal intent to be established in other contexts,” the report said, alluding to a region of Myanmar that is home for many Rohingya.
Adding into their assessment: The extreme brutality of the crimes; “hate rhetoric” and specific speech by perpetrators and military commanders; policies of exclusion against Rohingya people; an “oppressive context;” and the “level of organization indicating a plan for destruction.”
The investigators cited six Myanmar military leaders as “priority subjects” for possible prosecution, including Commander-in-Chief Min Aung Hlaing. A longer list of names is to be kept in the office of the U.N. human rights chief for possible use in future judicial proceedings. The United States and European Union have already slapped sanctions on some Myanmar military leaders, though Min Aung Hlaing is not among them.
“The main perpetrator, the people that we want the spotlight on, is the Tatmadaw,” said mission member Radhika Coomaraswamy, a Sri Lankan former U.N. undersecretary-general, referring to Myanmar’s military.
Christopher Sidoti, an Australian human rights expert, acknowledged that no “smoking gun” linked the six military leaders directly to orders to carry out genocide, but pointed to inferences of their role based on a strict chain of command in Myanmar.
They called for the creation of a special body, or “mechanism,” to keep watch on the still-evolving human rights situation in Myanmar. They said the United Nations’ own role in the country since 2011 should be reviewed to see if the world body did all it could to prevent such a crisis.
They also faulted Aung San Suu Kyi for not using her role as head of Myanmar’s government, nor her “moral authority” — she is a Nobel peace prize laureate — to stop the events in embattled Rakhine state.
Forum-Asia, an advocacy group, called the report “significant” and said the United Nations needed to heed its call.
“If the U.N. fails to adequately address these findings it will be a monumental failure for the world body, which has already been criticized for not doing enough,” said R. Iniyan Ilango, UN advocacy program manager for the group.
Praise also came from the ground in Cox’s Bazar, Bangladesh, where refugee camps have taken in hundreds of thousands of Royingya from across the border.
“We are happy for this. If these army people are punished the world will take note of it. They are killers. They must be punished,” said Mohammed Hasan, 46, who lives in the Kutupalong refugee camp.
“They killed thousands, we have seen that. They torched our homes, that’s a fact, they raped our women, that’s not false,” he said.

More than 15,000 gathered in the morning on a hilltop in the Kutupalong refugee camp, part of a sprawling web of settlements that are now home to nearly 900,000 Rohingya who have fled Myanmar to escape violence.
The camps exploded in size last year after Myanmar’s army launched a wave of anti-Rohingya attacks on Aug. 25, with some 700,000 Rohingya eventually pouring across the border. Thousands were killed in the violence.
“25th August — Black Day,” one banner announced Saturday.

The protesters — men, women and children — marched through the muddy camp, chanting slogans such as “No more genocide, we want justice.” At a mass prayer rally, one speaker repeatedly shouted, “Who are we?” to which the crowd responded in chorus: “Rohingya! Rohingya!”
Most people cried as they raised their hands while an imam who led the prayer sought God’s blessings, saying, “Please consider the people who have been killed as martyrs and place them in heaven.”
Some of the protesters carried paper flags of Myanmar. Newly setup shops inside the camp were closed during the protest, which lasted several hours.

Also on Saturday, some 100 protesters from a group of nongovernment organizations formed a human chain in front of the national press club in Dhaka, Bangladesh’s capital, to demand the international community put pressure on Myanmar’s government to try those responsible for murder, rape and arson, the English-language Daily Star reported.
“We are Rohingya, we are Muslims, we have been driven away from our land, from our homes,” an unidentified speaker told the crowd on Saturday. “We want justice. We want to go back to our homes.”
But many doubt they’ll ever be able to return despite more than a year of talks among Myanmar, Bangladesh, the United Nations and international aid agencies. Myanmar insists the Rohingya can return, and has built a series of camps for them, but few believe they would be safe there, or that they could finally be accepted as citizens.
While Rohingya have lived for centuries in Myanmar, they have long been treated as outsiders, Muslims in a largely Buddhist nation who are denied citizenship and many basic rights. Many in Myanmar ridicule them as “Bengalis” who came illegally from Bangladesh.

Most live in poverty in Myanmar’s Rakhine state, just across the border from Bangladesh. Over the past couple of decades, over 100,000 have fled into Bangladesh in earlier waves of violence. In total, more than 1 million Rohingya refugees currently live in Bangladesh.
In an editorial on Saturday, Bangladesh’s Daily Star newspaper was critical of Myanmar for its failure to make any visible progress in taking the refugees back over the last year, while it urged the international community to take action.
“We reiterate our call to the international community, particularly the U.N., to investigate allegations of crimes against the Rohingya people because the Myanmar government has shown little interest in bringing those responsible for such violations of human rights to justice,” the editorial said.
“It is time to tell the Rohingya that they are not a forgotten people,” it said.
The violence began on Aug. 24, 2017, with a series of attacks on Myanmar police stations by a small Rohingya militant group that killed a dozen security personnel. In retaliation, Myanmar’s military and Buddhist mobs launched waves of attacks, killing people and emptying villages in what many in the international community see as a calculated attempt to drive the Rohingya from the country."

Sisak, Associated Press","U.S. deports former Nazi camp guard, 95, to Germany","BERLIN — The last Nazi war crimes suspect facing deportation from the U.S. was taken from his New York City home and spirited early Tuesday morning to Germany, following years of efforts to remove him from the United States.
The deportation of the 95-year-old former Nazi camp guard, Jakiw Palij, came 25 years after investigators first confronted him about his World War II past and he admitted lying to get into the U.S., claiming he spent the war as a farmer and factory worker.
Palij lived quietly in the U.S. for years, as a draftsman and then as a retiree, until nearly three decades ago when investigators found his name on an old Nazi roster and a fellow former guard spilled the secret that he was “living somewhere in America.”
Palij told Justice Department investigators who showed up at his door in 1993: “I would never have received my visa if I told the truth. Everyone lied.”
A judge stripped Palij’s citizenship in 2003 for “participation in acts against Jewish civilians” while an armed guard at the Trawniki camp in Nazi-occupied Poland and was ordered deported a year later.
But because Germany, Poland, Ukraine, and other countries refused to take him, he continued living in limbo in the two-story, red brick home in Queens he shared with his wife, Maria, now 86. His continued presence there outraged the Jewish community, attracting frequent protests over the years that featured such chants as “your neighbor is a Nazi!”
According to the Justice Department, Palij served at Trawniki in 1943, the same year 6,000 prisoners in the camps and tens of thousands of other prisoners held in occupied Poland were rounded up and slaughtered. Palij has admitted serving in Trawniki but denied any involvement in war crimes.
Last September, all 29 members of New York’s congressional delegation signed a letter urging the State Department to follow through on his deportation.
Richard Grenell, the U.S. ambassador who arrived in Germany earlier this year, said President Donald Trump — who is from New York — instructed him to make it a priority. He said the new German government, which took office in March, brought “new energy” to the matter.
The deportation came after weeks of diplomatic negotiations.
Grenell told reporters that there were “difficult conversations” because Palij is not a German citizen and was stateless after losing his U.S. citizenship, but “the moral obligation” of taking in “someone who served in the name of the German government was accepted.”
Video footage from ABC News showed federal immigration agents carrying Palij out of his Queens apartment on a stretcher sometime during the day Monday.
Palij, with a fluffy white beard and a brown, newsboy-style cap atop his head, was wrapped in a sheet as the agents carried him down a brick stairway in front of his home and into a waiting ambulance. He ignored a reporter who shouted, “Are you a Nazi?” and “Do you have any regrets?”
His attorney, Ivars Berzins, did not immediately return telephone or email messages.
Palij landed in the western German city of Duesseldorf on Tuesday. The local government in Warendorf county, near Muenster, said Palij would be taken to a care facility in the town of Ahlen.
Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said that “there is no line under historical responsibility,” adding in comment to German daily Bild that doing justice to the memory of Nazi atrocities “means standing by our moral obligation to the victims and the subsequent generations.”
German prosecutors have previously said it does not appear that there’s enough evidence to charge Palij with wartime crimes.
Now that he is in Germany, Efraim Zuroff, the head Nazi-hunter at the Simon Wiesenthal Center, said he hoped prosecutors would revisit the case.
“Trawniki was a camp where people were trained to round up and murder the Jews in Poland, so there’s certainly a basis for some sort of prosecution,” he said in a telephone interview from Jerusalem, adding that the U.S. Department of Justice “deserves a lot of credit” for sticking with the case.
“The efforts invested by the United States in getting Palij deported are really noteworthy and I’m very happy to see that they finally met with success.”
Palij’s deportation is the first for a Nazi war crimes suspect since Germany agreed in 2009 to take John Demjanjuk, a retired Ohio autoworker who was accused of serving as a Nazi guard. He was convicted in 2011 of being an accessory to more than 28,000 killings and died 10 months later, at age 91, with his appeal pending.
Palij, whose full name is pronounced Yah-keev PAH’-lee, entered the U.S. in 1949 under the Displaced Persons Act, a law meant to help refugees from post-war Europe.
He told immigration officials that he worked during the war in a woodshop and farm in Nazi-occupied Poland; at another farm in Germany; and finally in a German upholstery factory. Palij said he never served in the military.
In reality, officials say, he played an essential role in the Nazi program to exterminate Jews in German-occupied Poland, as an armed guard at Trawniki. According to a Justice Department complaint, Palij served in a unit that “committed atrocities against Polish civilians and others” and then in the notorious SS Streibel Battalion, “a unit whose function was to round up and guard thousands of Polish civilian forced laborers.”
After the war, Palij maintained friendships with other Nazi guards who the government says came to the U.S. under similar false pretenses. And in an interesting coincidence, Palij and his wife purchased their home near LaGuardia Airport in 1966 from a Polish Jewish couple who had survived the Holocaust and were not aware of his past.
The Justice Department’s special Nazi-hunting unit started piecing together Palij’s past after a fellow Trawniki guard identified him to Canadian authorities in 1989. Investigators asked Russia and other countries for records on Palij beginning in 1990 and first confronted him in 1993.
It wasn’t until after a second interview in 2001 that he signed a document acknowledging he had been a guard at Trawniki and a member of the Streibel Battalion. Palij suggested at one point during that interview that he was threatened with death if he refused to work as a guard, saying “if you don’t show up, boom-boom.”
Though the last Nazi suspect ordered deported, Palij is not the last in the U.S.
Since 2017, Poland has been seeking the extradition of Ukrainian-born Michael Karkoc, an ex-commander in an SS-led Nazi unit that burned Polish villages and killed civilians during the war. The 99-year-old who currently lives in Minneapolis was the subject of a series of 2013 reports by the AP that led Polish prosecutors to issue an arrest warrant for him.
In addition to Karkoc, there are almost certainly others in the U.S. who have either not yet been identified or investigated by authorities.
The American public did not become fully aware until the 1970s that thousands of Nazi persecutors had gone to the U.S. after World War II. Some estimates say 10,000 may have made the U.S. their home after the war.
Since then, the Justice Department has initiated legal proceedings against 137 suspected Nazis, with about half, 67, being removed by deportation, extradition or voluntary departure. Of the rest, 28 died while their cases were pending and 9 were ordered deported but died in the U.S. because no other country was willing to take them.

The PBS NewsHour takes a moment every week to bring you important stories happening beyond the Beltway. Here’s what we’re reading now.

The Los Angeles Times has been publishing a series of stories about how California’s privacy laws for law enforcement keep police misconduct records hidden from the public, especially for officers who testify in court.
In one case the Times highlights, a deputy took the stand more than 30 times in criminal court before prosecutors became aware of his own history of misconduct. As a result, charges in some of the criminal cases in which he testified were dropped.
The newspaper said “California has the strictest laws in the country protecting the confidentiality of police misconduct records. The rules not only prohibit the public from seeing them, but also deny prosecutors direct access.”
The state’s current police privacy laws date back to the 1970s, when Los Angeles police officers shredded more than four tons of personnel records, angered by the number of complaints against them. In response, the Times reported, lawmakers passed a law that sought to ardently protect police confidentiality. [The Los Angeles Times]
Why it matters: There have been repeated attempts to increase the transparency of police misconduct records nationwide, but all have failed, including one that was spiked following the heightened public attention around police use of force following the 2014 fatal shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, the Times reported.
Historically, attempts to change the privacy laws have also met fierce — and successful — opposition from police unions.
But recently, there’s been a renewed effort to relax the privacy laws a bit. California’s Senate Bill 1421 would allow greater access to law enforcement records, although the Times noted that even if it passed, the bill “would still fall short of 21 other states that provide public access to records of all types of misconduct resulting in suspensions and other significant discipline.”
The bill must pass both houses of the state legislature by the end of the month and be signed by Gov. Jerry Brown. The newspaper points out that Brown approved the original police privacy law back in 1978 during his first time in office.

The U.S. government provided its most detailed numbers yet on family separations at the border.
After repeated calls for more information on the effort to reunify thousands of families affected by the Trump administration’s “zero tolerance” policy, U.S. immigration officials attached a long table with categorical breakdowns of who remains separated and under U.S. agencies’ care. There were some noteworthy numbers from the court filing:
For a closer look at other numbers, the PBS NewsHour wrote about the update here.
Both the U.S. government and the American Civil Liberties Union, who initially sued over family separations, have been working together to reunify the families. Both parties are expected back in court in San Diego this week to file additional updates on the reunifications. [The PBS NewsHour]
Why it matters: Late last week, U.S. District Court Judge Dana Sabraw told both parties that this effort to reunify separated migrant families, which has been happening for weeks now, “will not be a perfect process.”
The judge also said both parties’ latest plan to reunify the remaining hundreds of children looked “excellent.”
The plan said U.S. officials will work with the countries of origin to find the migrant parents who are no longer in the U.S. and to determine how they wish to proceed with the process to reunify with their children. They will ask these countries to post contact information for U.S. officials on ads and billboards. It remains to be seen how effective this would be in reaching the removed parents.
The ACLU’s Lee Gelernt told the judge that only fewer than 50 people were reached by then. Gelernt said the phone numbers could be “inoperative or some people may be in hiding.”
If anything, this latest plan and the weekly updates point to how slow and difficult the process has been.

Last week, the Treasury Department announced it had imposed economic sanctions on Myanmar security forces “for their involvement in ethnic cleansing” against Rohingya Muslims in Rakhine State and “widespread human rights abuses” of other ethnic minorities. The sanctions target four military and border guard commanders and two military units.
Myanmar, formerly known as Burma, is ruled by the majority ethnic Bamar — made up of mostly Buddhists — and has 135 ethnic groups recognized by the government. Since the Rohingya are not recognized as an indigenous ethnic group by the Myanmar government, they are not granted citizenship and are considered one of the largest stateless groups in the world.
“Burmese security forces have engaged in violent campaigns against ethnic minority communities across Burma, including ethnic cleansing, massacres, sexual assault, extrajudicial killings, and other serious human rights abuses,” Sigal Mandelker, a senior U.S. Treasury Department official, said in a statement.
The Treasury Department announcement traced the start of the atrocities to October 2016, when Myanmar’s military “committed widespread, systematic, and brutal acts of violence against Rohingya villagers” in three townships in northern Rakhine State. After border attacks in August 2017, the violence by the military escalated to a sweeping campaign, prompting the Rohingya to flee to neighboring Bangladesh. [The New York Times]
Why it matters: Myanmar, once a country under military rule that transitioned toward democracy, has taken an anti-democratic nosedive in recent years.
The 2018 Global Slavery Index said that the Rohingya exodus from Myanmar represented the “world’s fastest growing refugee crisis.” The United Nations estimates that more than 900,000 refugees live in Cox’s Bazar, a fishing city in Bangladesh where the Rohingya have fled and built makeshift camps.
Myanmar officials have claimed that the Rohingya burned their own villages and are terrorists. The government also jailed two Reuters reporters who were reporting on the Rohingya massacres. They are accused of breaking the colonial-era Official Secrets Act, which carries a maximum sentence of 14 years in prison.
The recent enhanced sanctions, targeting not only military commanders, but whole infantry divisions, is the strongest response yet from the U.S. government for the wave of violence plaguing Myanmar. The announcement said that the action “should serve as a warning that the security forces must cease such behavior immediately and respect and protect the human rights of all ethnic and religious groups in Burma.”
Aside from the mass ethnic cleansing of the Rohingyas, the Treasury Department also cited lesser-known abuses in Myanmar’s Kachin and Shan states where the military “committed extrajudicial killings, enforced disappearances, arbitrary arrests, and torture against civilians” from other minority communities.
Measles cases in Europe have hit a record high this year, according to the World Health Organization. Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images
Measles cases in Europe have hit a record high this year, according to the World Health Organization. More than 41,000 people have been infected in the first six months of 2018, causing 37 deaths. The WHO recorded 23,927 cases last year (the previous record high), which dwarfs the 5,273 infections from the year before.
The WHO called on European countries to act and stressed the need for vaccinations — pointing out that some communities were far more immunized than others. “This partial setback demonstrates that every person who is not immune remains vulnerable no matter where they live, and every country must keep pushing to increase coverage and close immunity gaps, even after achieving interrupted or eliminated status,” said Dr. Nedret Emiroglu, Director of the Division of Health Emergencies and Communicable Diseases at the WHO Regional Office for Europe.
Some 23,000 cases were recorded in Ukraine, while Serbia has seen 14 deaths from the disease, more than in any of the other countries. [The BBC]
Why it’s important: Measles is a highly contagious disease that can be spread through the air by coughing or sneezing. It can live in the air for up to two hours, according to the Centers for Disease Control.
The disease typically begins with a cough, runny nose and high fever, followed by skin rashes. Most people recover completely, but serious cases can include complications like pneumonia and brain swelling that could prove fatal, according to the CDC.
In Europe, the rate of immunization for measles inched up from 88 percent in the region in 2016 to 90 percent in 2017. But when it comes to immunization in individual countries, rates vary widely. Some communities reported immunization rates of more than 95 percent while others were below 70 percent, according to WHO.
Discredited research has linked the measles vaccine with autism, causing some to be weary about immunizing their children. The WHO stressed the key role vaccines play in the fight against measles. “We can stop this deadly disease,” said Dr Zsuzsanna Jakab, WHO’s Regional Director for Europe. “But we will not succeed unless everyone plays their part: to immunize their children, themselves, their patients, their populations – and also to remind others that vaccination saves lives.”

Football players from a top-ranked high school team in Loganville, Georgia, walked out on practice last week to protest grueling training conditions that had students concerned for their health, according to the Gwinnett Daily Post.
Both parents and players at Grayson High School expressed concerns, dating back to last season, about training sessions that involved full-contact drills in shorts, and workouts that led to body cramps, broken bones in players’ hands and ambulance trips for heat-related issues.
After nearly all the team’s players boycotted practice on Wednesday, head coach Christian Hunnicutt arranged a meeting with them to apologize and promise less intense training ahead of their season open. [Gwinnett Daily Post]
Why it matters: The walkout in Georgia comes amid renewed scrutiny over what some players and coaches describe as a culture of fear, intimidation and abuse in football.
Last week, at the University of Maryland, the school’s Board of Regents announced it would take over investigations into the death of offensive lineman Jordan McNair, who died in June of complications from a heatstroke suffered during a workout session. The team’s head coach, DJ Durkin, and other athletic staff members have since been placed on administrative leave.
In reporting the incident, ESPN revealed a culture of abuse that existed within the football program, in which players were allegedly verbally abused, continually degraded and encouraged to practice unhealthy eating habits in order to gain weight.
Allegations of abuse, fostered by an environment of fear and intimidation, are not new in the world of football. But John Feinstein, a Washington Post sports columnist and author, said the treatment in McNair’s case was “clearly excessive,” and it represents an abusive culture meant to push athletes to a peak performance.
“Football is a very macho sport. Players are pushed. They’re challenged,” he told the PBS NewsHour. “It appears based on what we know, that there were coaches at Maryland who didn’t see that line and went over it.”"
https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/former-un-secretary-general-kofi-annan-dies-at-age-80,refugee,1951,2018-08-18T09:53:12-04:00,"John Heilprin, Associated Press",Former UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan dies at age 80,"GENEVA — Kofi Annan, one of the world’s most celebrated diplomats and a charismatic symbol of the United Nations who rose through its ranks to become the first black African secretary-general, has died. He was 80.
His foundation announced his death in Switzerland’s capital, Bern, on Saturday in a tweet, saying he died after a short unspecified illness. It did not give details and remembered the Nobel Peace Prize winner as “radiating genuine kindness, warmth and brilliance in all he did.”
The president of Ghana, where Annan was born, said in a tweet that “I am … comforted by the information, after speaking to (Annan’s wife) Nane Maria, that he died peacefully in his sleep.”
Annan spent virtually his entire career as an administrator in the United Nations. His aristocratic style, cool-tempered elegance and political savvy helped guide his ascent to become its seventh secretary-general, and the first hired from within. He served two terms from Jan. 1, 1997, to Dec. 31, 2006, capped nearly mid-way when he and the U.N. were jointly awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2001.
During his tenure, Annan presided over some of the worst failures and scandals at the world body, one of its most turbulent periods since its founding in 1945. Challenges from the outset forced him to spend much of his time struggling to restore its tarnished reputation.
His enduring moral prestige remained largely undented, however, both through charisma and by virtue of having negotiated with most of the powers in the world.
When he departed from the United Nations, he left behind a global organization far more aggressively engaged in peacekeeping and fighting poverty, setting the framework for the U.N.’s 21st-century response to mass atrocities and its emphasis on human rights and development.
“Kofi Annan was a guiding force for good,” current U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said. “It is with profound sadness that I learned of his passing. In many ways, Kofi Annan was the United Nations. He rose through the ranks to lead the organization into the new millennium with matchless dignity and determination.”
Even out of office, Annan never completely left the U.N. orbit. He returned in special roles, including as the U.N.-Arab League’s special envoy to Syria in 2012. He remained a powerful advocate for global causes through his eponymous foundation.
Annan took on the top U.N. post six years after the collapse of the Soviet Union and presided during a decade when the world united against terrorism after the Sept. 11 attacks — then divided deeply over the U.S.-led war against Iraq. The U.S. relationship tested him as a world diplomatic leader.
“I think that my darkest moment was the Iraq war, and the fact that we could not stop it,” Annan said in a February 2013 interview with TIME magazine to mark the publication of his memoir, “Interventions: A Life in War and Peace.”
“I worked very hard — I was working the phone, talking to leaders around the world. The U.S. did not have the support in the Security Council,” Annan recalled in the videotaped interview posted on The Kofi Annan Foundation’s website.
“So they decided to go without the council. But I think the council was right in not sanctioning the war,” he said. “Could you imagine if the U.N. had endorsed the war in Iraq, what our reputation would be like? Although at that point, President (George W.) Bush said the U.N. was headed toward irrelevance, because we had not supported the war. But now we know better.”
Despite his well-honed diplomatic skills, Annan was never afraid to speak candidly. That didn’t always win him fans, particularly in the case of Bush’s administration, with whom Annan’s camp spent much time bickering. Much of his second term was spent at odds with the United States, the U.N.’s biggest contributor, as he tried to lean on the nation to pay almost $2 billion in arrears.
Kofi Annan spoke to the NewsHour’s Jeffrey Brown in 2012.
Kofi Atta Annan was born April 8, 1938, into an elite family in Kumasi, Ghana, the son of a provincial governor and grandson of two tribal chiefs.
He shared his middle name Atta — “twin” in Ghana’s Akan language — with a twin sister, Efua. He became fluent in English, French and several African languages, attending an elite boarding school and the University of Science and Technology in Kumasi. He finished his undergraduate work in economics at Macalester College in St. Paul, Minnesota, in 1961. From there he went to Geneva, where he began his graduate studies in international affairs and launched his U.N. career.
Annan married Titi Alakija, a Nigerian woman, in 1965, and they had a daughter, Ama, and a son, Kojo. He returned to the U.S. in 1971 and earned a master’s degree at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Sloan School of Management. The couple separated during the 1970s and, while working in Geneva, Annan met his second wife, Swedish lawyer Nane Lagergren. They married in 1984.
Annan worked for the U.N. Economic Commission for Africa in Ethiopia, its Emergency Force in Egypt, and the office of the High Commissioner for Refugees in Geneva, before taking a series of senior posts at U.N. headquarters in New York dealing with human resources, budget, finance, and staff security.
He also had special assignments. After Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990, he facilitated the repatriation from Iraq of more than 900 international staff and other non-Iraqi nationals, and the release of western hostages in Iraq. He led the initial negotiations with Iraq for the sale of oil in exchange for humanitarian relief.
Just before becoming secretary-general, Annan served as U.N. peacekeeping chief and as special envoy to the former Yugoslavia, where he oversaw a transition in Bosnia from U.N. protective forces to NATO-led troops.
The U.N. peacekeeping operation faced two of its greatest failures during his tenure: the Rwanda genocide in 1994, and the massacre in the Bosnian town of Srebrenica in July 1995.
In both cases, the U.N. had deployed troops under Annan’s command, but they failed to save the lives of the civilians they were mandated to protect. Annan offered apologies, but ignored calls to resign by U.S. Republican lawmakers. After became secretary-general, he called for U.N. reports on those two debacles — and they were highly critical of his management.

As secretary-general, Annan forged his experiences into a doctrine called the “Responsibility to Protect,” that countries accepted — at least in principle — to head off genocide, crimes against humanity, ethnic cleansing and war crimes.
Annan sought to strengthen the U.N.’s management, coherence and accountability, efforts that required huge investments in training and technology, a new whistleblower policy and financial disclosure requirements.
In 1998, he helped ease a transition to civilian rule in Nigeria and visited Iraq to try to resolve its impasse with the Security Council over compliance with weapons inspections and other matters. The effort helped avoid an outbreak of hostilities that seemed imminent at the time.
In 1999, he was deeply involved in the process by which East Timor gained independence from Indonesia, and started the “Global Compact” initiative that has grown into the world’s largest effort to promote corporate social responsibility.
Annan was chief architect of what became known as the Millennium Development Goals, and played a central role in creating the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria and the U.N.’s first counter-terrorism strategy.
Annan’s uncontested election to a second term was unprecedented, reflecting the overwhelming support he enjoyed from both rich and poor countries. Timothy Wirth, president of the United Nations Foundation, which disburses Ted Turner’s $1 billion pledge to U.N. causes, hailed “a saint-like sense about him.”
In 2005, Annan succeeded in establishing the Peacebuilding Commission and the Human Rights Council. But that year, the U.N. was facing almost daily attacks over allegations about corruption in the U.N. oil-for-food program in Iraq, bribery by U.N. purchasing officials and widespread sex abuse by U.N. peacekeepers — an issue that would only balloon in importance after he left office.
It emerged that Annan’s son, Kojo, had not disclosed payments he received from his employer, which had a $10 million-a-year contract to monitor humanitarian aid under the oil-for-food program. The company paid at least $300,000 to Kojo so he would not work for competitors after he left.
An independent report criticized the secretary-general for being too complacent, saying he should have done more to investigate matters even if he was not involved with the awarding of the contract.
World leaders agreed to create an internal U.N. ethics office, but a major overhaul of the U.N.’s outdated management practices and operating procedures was left to Annan’s successor, Ban Ki-moon.
Before leaving office, Annan helped secure a truce between Israel and Hezbollah in 2006, and mediated a settlement of a dispute between Cameroon and Nigeria over the Bakassi peninsula.
At a farewell news conference, Annan listed as top achievements the promotion of human rights, the fighting to close the gap between extreme poverty and immense wealth, and the U.N. campaign to fight infectious diseases like AIDS.
He never took disappointments and setbacks personally. And he kept his view that diplomacy should take place in private and not in the public forum.
In his memoir, Annan recognized the costs of taking on the world’s top diplomatic job, joking that “SG,” for secretary-general, also signified “scapegoat” around U.N. headquarters.
Former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations Richard Holbrooke called Annan “an international rock star of diplomacy.”
After leaving his high-profile U.N. perch, Annan didn’t let up. In 2007, his Geneva-based foundation was created. That year he helped broker peace in Kenya, where election violence had killed over 1,000 people.
He also joined The Elders, an elite group of former leaders founded by Nelson Mandela, eventually succeeding Desmond Tutu as its chairman after a failed interlude trying to resolve Syria’s rising civil war.
Annan “represented our continent and the world with enormous graciousness, integrity and distinction,” Tutu said Saturday in a statement, adding that “we give great thanks to god” for him.
As special envoy to Syria in 2012, Annan won international backing for a six-point plan for peace. The U.N. deployed a 300-member observer force to monitor a cease-fire, but peace never took hold and Annan was unable to surmount the bitter stalemate among Security Council powers. He resigned in frustration seven months into the job, as the civil war raged on.
Annan continued to crisscross the globe. In 2017, his foundation’s biggest projects included promotion of fair, peaceful elections; work with Myanmar’s government to improve life in troubled Rakhine state; and battling violent extremism by enlisting young people to help.
He also remained a vocal commentator on troubles like the refugee crisis; promoted good governance, anti-corruption measures and sustainable agriculture in Africa; and pushed efforts in the fight against illegal drug trafficking.
Annan retained connections to many international organizations. He was chancellor of the University of Ghana, a fellow at New York’s Columbia University, and professor at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy in Singapore.
His homeland of Ghana was shaken by his death. “One of our greatest compatriots,” President Nana Akufo-Addo said, calling for a week with flags at half-mast. “Rest in perfect peace, Kofi. You have earned it.”
Annan is survived by his wife and three children. Funeral arrangements weren’t immediately announced.

https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/24-migrant-children-under-age-5-remain-separated-from-their-parents-new-court-filing-says,refugee,1099,2018-08-17T17:12:57-04:00,Joshua Barajas,"24 migrant children under age 5 remain separated from their parents, new court filing says","Under U.S. District Court instructions, the U.S. government has provided its most comprehensive numbers yet on family separations at the border.
As a result of the “zero tolerance” policy that the Trump administration rolled out earlier this year, U.S. immigration officials separated more than 2,600 migrant children from their families. And since a June executive order halted the practice and the American Civil Liberties Union sued the government over the separations, the federal government has been under court-imposed deadlines to reunify the thousands of families affected by the action.
In a hearing Friday, the ACLU pointed to some of the difficulties of reaching hundreds of parents who are no longer in the U.S. and separated from their children.
ACLU’s Lee Gelernt, who has been at these weekly court updates, said that officials so far have called about 120 people, but reached fewer than 50 of the intended migrant parents. He said that phone numbers “may be inoperative or some people may be in hiding.”
Gelernt also said the parents that were reached made it clear that they’d like to be reunified in their home country.
At the heart of Friday’s hearing was the question of whether this next wave of reunifications would occur in families’ home countries or in the U.S.
Here’s what a Thursday joint court filing said about the current status of the reunification effort and what we can expect next in the process.
For several weeks now, the lawsuit over family separations has been playing out of a federal court in San Diego. Every week, the ACLU has pressed the government to provide more transparency and more data into the family reunification process. U.S. District Judge Dana Sabraw has agreed, ordering the government to provide information.
On Thursday, the U.S. included its most detailed data yet — a table with more specific categories — in the status report.
Of the total 2,654 separated migrant children in government custody, age 0 to 17, 2,089 have been “discharged.” That means the children were either reunified with their parents or were placed with government-approved sponsors within the U.S., among other circumstances.
For those who remain in government custody, under the care of the Office of Refugee Resettlement, or ORR, which is overseen by the Department of Health and Human Services, here are the latest numbers:
The total number of children that remain in government custody: 565. Of those, 24 children are under age 5. Here’s how the U.S. further breaks down those numbers:
The report cautions that the additional numbers may not add to the 565 total in government custody because there may be overlap with some of the adults. One adult, for example, could have a “red flag” on their background check and had also waived their right to reunification with their child, the U.S. said.
The U.S. also said it needed additional time to provide more information on the parents who waived their right to reunify with their children, specifically for the young migrants who are no longer under the government’s care. This is also because the government said it wants to place priority on the children that are still under its care. It remains to be seen if Judge Sabraw grants the U.S. the extended deadline.
On Friday, Judge Sabraw said that it was important to note that the continued effort to reunify separated parents with their children “will not be a perfect process” and is an enormous undertaking that is of the government’s own making. He also stressed the importance of reunifying families as efficiently as possible.
ACLU lawyers and the organization’s network of volunteers and other resources have been helping the U.S. government reunite these families. In an earlier phase of the effort, both parties worked to reunite more than 1,600 families at select U.S. Immigration Customs and Enforcement facilities.
Now, among the children who remain in U.S. custody, the largest group is comprised of the 366 whose parents are no longer in the U.S. The government filed its latest plan in court that shows how it expects to reunify these adults with their children.
On Friday, Judge Sabraw said the joint plan “looks excellent.”
As in prior plans, there’s a review process at the beginning that determines whether there are any doubts to parentage or a child’s safety. If not, officials will then work with the U.S. embassies in each of the countries to which parents were removed, to help find contact information for these parents.
The State Department is expected to provide daily updates on parents’ contact information to HHS, among other actions:
From there, the ACLU will help determine if the removed parents wish to waive their rights to reunify with their children. It should be noted that ACLU filed several testimonies weeks ago from separated parents who said they felt they were pressured by immigration officials to sign forms that waived their reunification rights in a “coercive and misleading manner.” As detailed in personal declarations by the parents, language barriers, truncated time with lawyers or other representatives, and distrust of U.S. officials, meant that migrant parents may not have known what was actually happening when signing documents concerning their reunification rights. ACLU argued at the time that some parents “in fact do want their kids back.”
From there, if removed parents still wish to reunify with their children, the U.S. will provide transportation for the young migrants to their countries of origin where they will finally be reunited.
ACLU, however, argued in a separate filing that “some separated families can only be made whole by returning the parent to the United States.”
The organization said that, in some cases, “removed parents may not have availed themselves of their right to seek asylum because they were misled or coerced into believing that asserting their asylum claim would delay or preclude reunification.”
Judge Sabraw on Friday advised both parties to confer and reach solutions on how to continue this next phase of family reunification. The judge appeared to lean toward the government’s argument that reunifications occur in families’ home countries, but he’d like both parties to come up with proposals on how to move forward.
On a final note, California state senators passed a resolution Thursday requesting that President Donald Trump and Congress accept responsibility for the practice of separating migrant families at the southwest border, KPBS reported.
The resolution also calls for Congress to issue a formal apology to the affected migrant children. It’s doubtful, however, that the Trump administration will oblige the state senators’ resolution.

Senators on the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs investigations subcommittee hearing blasted immigration officials, including U.S. Public Health Service Commissioned Corps Commander Jonathan D. White, over what they described as a lack of progress on improving the “unaccompanied alien children” program that shelters unaccompanied migrant youth and places them with sponsors while they await their immigration court proceedings.
READ MORE: What happens when a child arrives at the U.S. border?
More than 200,000 unaccompanied migrant children have entered the U.S. since 2012, according to a Senate staff report released Wednesday, often to escape violence and poverty in their home countries. The interagency “UAC” program they are placed into upon arrival is managed by the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Health and Human Services, and for years, it has been criticized for a lack of oversight that can makes migrant children more vulnerable to human trafficking and abuse.
Investigations into the program began in 2015, when members of the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations first learned about a case in which Health and Human Services failed to properly vet sponsors, putting eight Guatemalan children into the custody of human traffickers who forced them to work 12-hour shifts at an egg farm in Ohio.
“We have a serious problem on our hands: these children are at risk of trafficking and abuse,” Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, said at Thursday’s hearing. “When these children do not appear for their immigration proceedings they lose their chance to argue for immigration relief, and many remain in this country illegally,” he added.
The hearing and the report highlighted many of the program’s shortcomings, emphasizing that despite a number of recommendations offered by the subcommittee over three years, little progress had been made to improve the program and ensure the children’s welfare.
Here’s a look at four problems with the program, according to members of the subcommittee:
It isn’t clear who is legally responsible for the well-being of children once they leave the shelters.
Lawmakers have urged HHS to take responsibility for children even after they have been placed in the custody of sponsors. But at the hearing, White said the agency’s custodial relationship to the children ends as soon as they exit the shelters.
“HHS does not presently have the authority to exercise supervision or oversight of children who are not in the physical care and custody of [the Fffice of Refugee Resettlement]. It certainly does not have the appropriations, and I would submit that at present it is not capacitated to do that,” he said.
Other HHS officials have recognized that this interpretation of the law places children in what they call “legal no man’s land,” in which no federal agency claims responsibility over ensuring the children are not trafficked or abused.
Portman asked White if he would support legislation that clarified the question of responsibility over the children.
“It’s not for me to say what I would support,” White said, but added that HHS would “always execute all of its requirements under law.”
“Every state has a child welfare agency…because you know what the states do? They take the responsibility for having children in their state seriously,” Sen. Claire McCaskill said at Thursday’s hearing. File photo by Laurie Skrivan/St. Louis Post-Dispatch/TNS via Getty Images.
State and local governments are not notified when children are being place in their jurisdictions
HHS has insisted the welfare of children once they leave government custody is in the hands of the sponsor, and has deferred any other responsibility to the state and local child welfare authorities that have jurisdiction over where the child lives. But the subcommittee report found that no state or local government entities are notified when a child is released from a shelter or is placed with a sponsor in their communities.
HHS said it planned to notify state governments but did not do so because it could not determine whom to notify in the state governments, the report said.
“Are you kidding me?” exclaimed Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., citing the report’s finding at the hearing. “Every state has a child welfare agency…because you know what the states do? They take the responsibility for having children in their state seriously,” she added.
Without being notified, the report says, states are limited in the services they can provide or in ensuring the children are attending public school.
“I’d like to see you all stepping up to this,” Sen. Maggie Hassan, D-N.H., said. “If [a] child doesn’t come into school and the school knows the child is supposed to be there, the school can investigate. The school can save a child from neglect and trauma, but not if they don’t know if the child is there.”
Calls go unanswered, sponsors are not held accountable for custody agreements
Since 2016, all children who have gone through the placement process have received a one-time call from the agency 30 days after their release to verify their safety. But at a hearing in April, Senators learned that the agency had not been able to contact nearly 1,500 children it had tried to reach over a three-month period in 2017.
Senators accused the agency of losing the children, but White told the panel some families opted not to take the agency’s calls.
“There are no lost children. There are some families that don’t take our call, there’s a big difference,” he said.
White said there is no legal requirement for families to answer the agency’s welfare check-up calls. Senators argued again that the agency was refusing to enforce oversight over the children.
Unaccompanied children are increasingly failing to show up to their immigration hearings
Senators are concerned U.S. agencies are failing these children, the PBS NewsHour’s Lisa Desjardins reports.
It’s not only the government’s job to make sure kids aren’t being put at greater risk of exploitation or abuse, but also to ensure “the integrity of our immigration system,” Portman said. “And neither one is being accomplished right now.”
Senators pointed out that more than half of unaccompanied children failed to show up at their immigration court hearings, and that these children are likely to remain in the country illegally.
Lawyers can help ensure children attend hearings and do not fall off the radar, but HHS is not responsible for ensuring legal representation as children go through immigration proceedings.
What’s next?
Senators asked the immigration officials for legislative changes that would support their efforts in improving the UAC program and protecting children.
HHS and DHS recently submitted a plan that the subcommittee had requested to demarcate each agency’s role and standardize the processing of unaccompanied migrant children. The plan, 17 months overdue, has not yet been cleared for release by the agencies.

For Republicans, the night ended with a surprise concession, while another former governor’s comeback bid ended in defeat.
Here are several takeaways from key races Tuesday night:
Vermont
Progressive Democrat Christine Hallquist won her party’s nomination for governor in Vermont and is the first transgender gubernatorial candidate by a major political party. She’s the fourth LGBTQ gubernatorial candidate Democrats have nominated this year. Hallquist, who was backed by the same group that propelled Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to victory in a New York Congressional primary in June, will face incumbent Republican Gov. Phil Scott. Ethan Sonneborn, a 14-year-old candidate, finished last in the four-candidate field.
In the state’s Senate race, incumbent Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders, who was a 2016 Democratic candidate for president, easily won the Democratic primary. He will likely decline the nomination to run as an independent again, but his victory assures he will not face a Democratic challenger in the general election.
Minnesota
Two Muslim Americans could make political history in November after their victories in the Democratic primaries in Minnesota.
Rep. Keith Ellison easily won the Democratic nomination for attorney general despite allegations of domestic abuse that emerged over the weekend. The Democratic National Committee is investigating the allegations that Ellison vehemently denies. Ellison would be the first Muslim elected for statewide office in American history. Previously, he was the first Muslim elected to Congress in 2007.
In the race to fill Ellison’s Congressional seat in the 5th District, state Rep. Ilhan Omar, who came to the United States as a refugee two decades ago, is poised to became the first Somali-American in Congress if she wins this safe Democratic district in November. She could also join Rashida Tlaib, who won a Michigan congressional primary last week, as the first two Muslim women in Congress. Omar had the support of Ocasio-Cortez in the crowded Democratic primary and campaigned to back a “Medicare for all” plan and a $15 minimum wage.
Despite outspending his opponent, former two-term Republican Gov. Tim Pawlenty lost his comeback bid in the Minnesota GOP gubernatorial primary to former state Rep. Jeff Johnson. Pawlenty, a 2012 GOP presidential candidate and Washington lobbyist, has been critical of President Donald Trump, contributing to his failure with the GOP base. His loss is one of the best examples of how the Republican Party has shifted in the last decade. In the Democratic primary, Rep. Tim Walz defeated party-backed candidate Erin Murphy for the nomination for governor.
Connecticut
In Connecticut’s 5th Congressional District, teacher Jahana Hayes beat party-backed candidate Mary Glassman to win the nomination in a safe Democratic district left vacant after Rep. Elizabeth Esty decided not to run for re-election following her handling of sexual harassment allegations within her office. Hayes, who had the support of members of the Congressional Black Caucus and labor groups, will likely be the first African-American woman to represent Connecticut in Congress.
Democrats nominated Ned Lamont, the party’s runner-up in 2010, to succeed outgoing Gov. Dan Malloy. He’ll face Republican Bob Stefanowski in November in one of the best chances the GOP has to flip a Democratic-held seat.
Wisconsin
Democrats hope Tony Evers, who emerged from a 10-candidate primary field, will be the one to defeat incumbent Republican Gov. Scott Walker in his quest for a third term. Walker, who also survived a 2012 recall effort that made him a lightning rod in the labor movement, has seen his approval ratings drop since his failed run for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination and is facing one of his toughest re-election battles. Trump was the first Republican presidential candidate to win Wisconsin in 32 years, but Democrats hope the national mood will also help them win the governor’s mansion.
A close Walker ally also emerged as the Republican nominee to take on incumbent Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin in November. State Sen. Leah Vukmir relied on her political experience to defeat Marine veteran Kevin Nicholson. The GOP is hoping to flip the Democratic-held seat and maintain control of the Senate.
In the district of retiring House Speaker Paul Ryan, Republicans nominated Bryan Steil, a lawyer and former Ryan staffer. He easily defeated white supremacist Paul Nehlen and four other candidates in the GOP primary. Democrats nominated ironworker Randy Bryce, who first entered the race before Ryan announced his retirement. Bryce used a massive fundraising advantage he accrued after his introductory campaign ad went viral to overcome revelations of previous arrests and delinquent child support payments.
A final note: Kansas governor concedes primary defeat
Only four states had primary elections Tuesday, but the Kansas gubernatorial matchup was decided, too, one week after voting concluded. Kansas Gov. Jeff Colyer conceded the Republican nomination to Secretary of State Kris Kobach late Tuesday. Colyer trailed Kobach, who had been endorsed by President Trump, by fewer than 400 votes, but Colyer said he would not ask for a recount and will instead work to elect Kobach.
With Kobach’s name on the ticket, Democrats are in a better position to win back the governor’s mansion. Democratic nominee Laura Kelly, who won the nomination last week, leads Kobach by just one point in a general election poll conducted last month. The same poll showed Colyer would have a comfortable 10-point lead over the Democrat had he been nominated."
https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/state-probe-says-treatment-of-immigrant-teens-not-abuse,refugee,536,2018-08-13T13:17:15-04:00,"Michael Biesecker, Associated Press",State probe says treatment of immigrant teens not abuse,"WASHINGTON — A state review into the treatment of immigrant teens held at a Virginia detention center confirms the facility uses restraint techniques that can include strapping children to chairs and placing mesh bags over their heads.
But investigators concluded the harsh treatment described by detainees at the Shenandoah Valley Juvenile Center did not meet the state’s legal threshold of abuse or neglect, according to a copy of the findings issued Monday by the Virginia Department of Juvenile Justice and obtained by The Associated Press.
The regulators did make several recommendations to improve conditions inside the facility, including hiring more bilingual staff and better screening to provide care for detainees who suffer from mental health issues.
Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam ordered the review in June hours after the AP published first-person accounts by children as young as 14 who said they were handcuffed, shackled and beaten at the facility, located near Staunton, Virginia. They also described being stripped of their clothes and locked in solitary confinement, sometimes strapped to chairs with bags over their heads.
The state investigators said they were unable to interview the immigrant teens who made sworn statements saying they were severely abused. Those who made the initial complaints as part of a federal class-action lawsuit filed in November 2017, were subsequently transferred to other facilities or deported back to their home countries after the resolution of their immigration cases.
Hannah M. Lieberman, a lawyer at the at the Washington Committee for Civil Rights and Urban Affairs representing the Latino teens in the lawsuit, said the state report does not disprove that the abuse allegations by her clients. She said the legal case against the facility will proceed.
The incidents described in sworn statements from six Latino teens are alleged to have occurred between 2015 and 2018, under both the Obama and Trump administrations.
Though incarcerated in a facility similar to a prison, the children detained on administrative immigration charges have not been convicted of any crime. The U.S. Office of Refugee Resettlement oversees the care of immigrant children held in federal custody.
Of the 22 residents at the facility interviewed by state investigators in June following AP’s report, three said they had experienced abusive behavior by staff. According to the state report, local child protective services investigators reviewed those complaints and determined they “did not meet the legal definition of abuse or neglect.”
While the investigators said they found no evidence of the beatings and other severe abuse described in the lawsuit, their report does confirm that staff at the Shenandoah facility are trained in the use of restraint chairs and “mesh spit guards” for “out-of-control residents who cannot be safely restrained by less intrusive methods.”
Such restraint devices are legal for use in juvenile detention facilities in Virginia, though regulations say they can never be used as punishment and are only appropriate “to ensure the safety and security of residents, staff and the facility.”
In two of the instances reviewed by investigators, the report says staff members at the facility were disciplined for using restraint techniques that did not follow state guidelines. However, those two incidents, which were not detailed in the report, did not involve the use of restraint chairs."

Ecologists in Myanmar spend hours and hours fighting through thick vines, forest and bamboo just to find a single Asian elephant. Now, they’re also racing against poachers.
Over the last three to four years, poachers have begun taking the elephant’s skin and turning it into ruby red jewelry. The skin is also ground into powder and sold as medicine, according to separate investigations conducted by the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute and Elephant Family, a conservation watchdog in the UK.
With about 50,000 left in the wild overall, Asian elephants are 10 times more endangered than African savanna elephants and half as common as African forest elephants. Unlike their well-known African cousins on the open savanna, Asian elephants prefer the seclusion of the thick jungle. Yet this insulation appears unable to protect from a new wave in poaching that is poised to wipe out the 2,000 remaining Asian elephants living in the wilds of Myanmar.
In the past, ivory poaching has had a limited impact on Asian elephants because only adult males grow tusks, and even then it only happens 25 percent of the time. Skin poaching is much more problematic than killing elephants for their ivory because it’s indiscriminate — it targets adult males, adult females and calves.

“It’s the surest way to drive the species into extinction,” said Peter Leimgruber, director of Smithsonian’s Conservation Ecology Center, whose team of ecologists stumbled on this uptick in poaching, while conducting a routine tracking study in Myanmar.
At its current pace, this skin poaching trend could wipe out Myanmar’s wild elephants in less than 60 years.
Asia’s rapid population growth and habitat loss, caused by development and mass agriculture for crops like rice and palm oil, has spawned a pattern of human-elephant conflict — both inside and outside of Myanmar. Asian elephants are known to consume crops and, when threatened, destroy human homes. In May, a 12-year-old Rohingya refugee was killed when an Asian elephant attacked a temporary housing settlement in Bangladesh.
“We wanted to learn about the basic ecology of elephants and what brings them into conflict with people,” John McEvoy, a movement ecologist with the Conservation Ecology Center and one of the researchers in the field, told PBS NewsHour. “We really just discovered this poaching by accident.”
Starting in late 2014, Leimgruber’s team placed GPS collars on 19 Asian elephants spread across three small areas in Myanmar: the Bago Yoma mountain range, the Ayeryarwady Delta and a small strip of land in Tanintharyi.
Leimgruber said their tracking system worked like the “Find my iPhone” app, except packaged into a 23-pound collar. Every four hours, the collar beamed text messages to a satellite with an elephant’s location, which was then relayed via email to the researcher’s smartphones or computers. Elephants at the Smithsonian National Zoo in Washington D.C. wore the collars for a year to ensure the devices didn’t cause discomfort.
“We found that for some of them, all of a sudden, their collars would stop working or stop sending signals,” Leimgruber said. “Five of them we knew were poached. We found them poached. Then there were two that disappeared, and the way their movement changed right before they disappeared indicated that they were probably poached too.”

This unexpected pillage led the Smithsonian researchers to partner with Human-elephant Peace, a Myanmar-based outreach program geared toward raising public awareness about human-elephant conflict. Together, they spread out and collected reports of poaching from villages.
In the end, they found about 45 poached elephants between March 2015 to August 2017. A separate survey by the Myanmar government reported 25 poached elephants in 2016. Combined with the Smithsonian numbers, this poaching tally over the last three years is more than double what the country witnessed from 2010 to 2014. Myanmar strictly controls the possession of firearms, so poachers rely on herbicides packed into poison darts to kill Asian elephants, according to communications between government officials and the Smithsonian.
“If we lose the elephant, we lose our national treasure. Also, our new generation will never again see the wild elephant,” said Aung Myo Chit, Myanmar country coordinator of the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute.

Elephant Family, a British conservation group that specializes in Asian elephants, first heard whispers about this skin poaching in late 2012.
At the time, their group was working with government officials and building a report about the illegal trade of living animals from Myanmar to Thailand.

Around 15,000 Asian elephants are kept in captivity across the continent, but under international law, it’s illegal to trade Asian elephant in any form — except for rare cases such as swapping blood samples for scientific purposes or sharing animals between zoos.
“When elephants started to be found killed for their skin, there was clearly a whole new industry and a whole new trade going on,” said Belinda Stewart-Cox, director of conservation at Elephant Family.
Starting in January 2014, Elephant Family launched an investigation into the black market surrounding the skin poaching. Their team found online advertisements for beads made from Asian elephant skin and that illegal traders in China are the main customers for Myanmar’s poached elephants, which matched similar findings made by the Smithsonian.
When the skin is taken off, it’s a good inch thick. “Some of those pieces are being cut into cubes and those cubes dried and then turned into beads,” Stewart-Cox said. The beads were being sold as prayer bracelets, necklaces and other collectibles. Elephant Family tracked down online sellers on social media platforms like Baidu and WeChat.

“If you look at them, you think they look like garnets, rubies or some kind of red stone,” Stewart-Cox said. “But those subcutaneous layers [in the skin] include a lot of blood vessels, so there’s a lot of blood in that. Those beads look ruby red because they contain blood.”
The elephant skin is also ground into powder for pharmaceutical medicine. Sellers claim the skin can treat stomach conditions like ulcers, gastritis and stomach cancer.
China has a reputation for being a hub for the illegal wildlife trade, but it is hardly the sole culprit.
While tracking the illegal wildlife trade is notoriously challenging, multiple reports suggest the bulk of elephant ivory lands in China, the U.S. The commercial sale of ivory was banned in 1989 under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) — though the treaty allows exception for South Africa, Zimbabwe, Namibia and Botswana to export other African elephant parts.
Moreover, China has made recent progress in its battle to reduce the nation’s demand for illegal elephant parts. In December, Chinese President Xi Jinping instituted a ban on domestic ivory trade as part of a joint arrangement made with President Barack Obama in 2015. In March, President Donald Trump partially reversed this ban, allowing elephant trophy imports.
“The ban was not an easy thing for China to do,” Stewart-Cox said. “But we need China’s help to crack down on this new trade.”

Under CITES, all trading of Asian elephant in any form is prohibited, except in rare cases such as biological samples for research purposes or the sharing of animals between zoos.
Chinese officials denied the findings of the Elephant Family’s report in April.
“The amount of elephant skin imported into China is very limited although importing elephant skin in China is not banned,” Meng Xianlin, executive director-general of China’s endangered species of wild fauna and flora import and export management office, said according to state media, in reference to their legal skin imports from Africa. “The report of the charity is cooked.”
It’s unclear if the sale of blood beads has spread to the U.S., Japan and Great Britain and other nations that rank among the most popular destinations for Asian elephant parts, according to CITES data.
To thwart potential sales of these skin products, the Smithsonian, U.S. Fish and Wildlife and Compass Films, a French production company working in Myanmar, have released public service announcements and created a community outreach program.
Leimgruber said education is the key to stopping demand for blood beads and skin powder — and by extension, putting an end to the poaching.
“Most people that purchase these products have no idea what they’re doing,” Leimgruber said. “That means we need to go to the places where the markets are and educate consumers about how damaging the impact is of what they’re doing.”

The powerful quake claimed hundreds of lives, wounded thousands more and displaced over 270,000 people. But it left her own home in the provincial capital, Mataram, still standing and nobody in her family was harmed.
On Thursday, though, a strong aftershock shook the walls of Handayani’s kitchen, prompting the pregnant 27-year-old to run outside in a panic. On a curb outside, she tripped and fell, glimpsing blood on her clothes before blacking out.
“When I woke up … I was in the hospital, and my (unborn) child was gone,” Handayani said, weeping as she told her story Friday in a green tent set up to house patients because it was considered unsafe to treat them inside.
Officials have recorded a staggering 450 aftershocks since Sunday.[\pullquote]
While the 7.0 magnitude quake that struck Lombok on Aug. 5 caused widespread damage and casualties that will never be forgotten here, an incessant wave of aftershocks is fueling a sense that the crisis is far from over — and that the worst may be yet to come.
Seismic activity is commonplace across the Indonesian archipelago, which is home to more active volcanoes than anywhere else on Earth. The country straddles the so-called “Ring of Fire,” an arc of volcanoes and fault lines that stretch across the Pacific Basin. A magnitude 9.1 earthquake off the Indonesian island of Sumatra in 2004 spawned a tsunami that killed 230,000 people in a dozen countries.

Thursday’s aftershock, rated at 6.2 by local authorities and 5.9 by the U.S. Geological Survey, buried four people in northern Lombok, Sutopo said. At least two dozen people were injured, including 17 who were still being treated Friday at West Nusatenggara Provincial General Hospital in Mataram.

The midday quake was so strong it rocked a six-story Indonesian naval ship that was treating wounded survivors offshore, causing civilians and crew to scurry off an adjacent concrete dock that had already cracked apart. The quake split apart roads near the coast and sparked landslides that cut off routes used by emergency medical workers and rescue crews who are still trying to clear rubble and recover the dead. At least one rescue team with excavators had to suspend its work after the quake.
Abdul Hakim, a 48-year-old welder in Tanjung, a hard-hit village, said his home was damaged by Sunday’s quake and he had been sleeping outdoors with his family in a makeshift tent since then. Tired of living like a refugee and bitten by mosquitoes, he said he was just about to return home.
But Thursday’s quake destroyed his house, which completely collapsed, he said. “It forced us back to this (tented) shelter again,” he said. “We will try to survive … we don’t have a choice.”
Jamilah, a mother of two in another village, Gubug Baru, said “one or two” houses in her village were still standing before Thursday’s tremor flattened them all.
In Mataram, several buildings collapsed in clouds of dust and some shops closed. Several hotels sent terrified staff home for the day.
Handayani, who had been nearly three months pregnant, said another strong quake had been the last thing she’d expected. As her husband, Hasanuddin Noer, patted her back to calm her, Handayani said: “We’ve been trying for four years to have a child. This was very painful.”
Noer, 30, said he had considered his family lucky until Thursday.
“If you ask when this disaster will stop, it’s like you asked the wind, there’s no answer,” he said.
Another patient at the hospital with one arm in a sling and an IV in the other, 70-year-old Jami-ah, said she had been sleeping in tents with her family in her backyard, fearing a new earthquake would cause their house to crumble. But she had gone inside briefly to go the bathroom when the aftershock struck.
She fell down, and fell again as she fled down a stairwell from her terrace, breaking bones in her arm. Doctors later discovered she was bleeding internally, somewhere around her stomach.
“Must I live in fear every day? … It never stops,” said Jami-ah, who like many Indonesians uses only one name. “I’m afraid the next earthquake will kill me.”"

Yet the bulk of the hiring has occurred in bastions of Democratic voters rather than in the Republican counties that put Trump in the White House.
On average for the year-ended this May, 58.5 percent of the job gains were in counties that backed Democrat Hillary Clinton in 2016, according to an Associated Press analysis of monthly government jobs data by county.
Despite an otherwise robust national economy, the analysis shows that a striking number of Trump counties are losing jobs. The AP found that 35.4 percent of Trump counties have shed jobs in the past year, compared with just 19.2 percent of Clinton counties.
The jobs data shows an economy that is as fractured as the political landscape ahead of the 2018 midterm elections. As more money pools in such corporate hubs as Houston, San Francisco or Seattle, prosperity spills over less and less to smaller towns and cities in America’s interior. That would seem to undercut what Trump sees as a central accomplishment of his administration — job creation for middle class and blue-collar workers in towns far removed from glitzy urban centers.
Job growth in Trump’s economy is still concentrated in the same general places as it was toward the end of Barack Obama’s presidency — when roughly 58.7 percent of the average annual job gains were in Democratic counties.
Yet the lack of transformative job growth in Trump areas hasn’t seemed to erode his support among Republicans, while hiring in Democratic areas have done little to improve his standing with those voters. For Trump’s core supporters, cultural issues such as gun rights, immigration and loyalty to the president have become dominant priorities.

Trump has pointed with pride at a strengthening national economy in hopes that voters will reward the Republican Party by preserving its majorities in the House and Senate this year. The government reported the fastest quarterly economic growth since 2014 and the unemployment rate is a healthy 3.9 percent. At a Pennsylvania rally on Thursday, the president declared, “Our economy is soaring. Our jobs are booming.”
But other issues preoccupy the minds of the party faithful in Trump strongholds such as Beaver County, Pennsylvania, northwest of Pittsburgh.
Chip Kohser, the county Republican chairman and the bristle-bearded founder of a farm share company, said his party members are rallying around their staunch opposition to gun control.
“Our No. 1 motivating factor,” he said, “is Second Amendment issues.”
Kohser, 41, drives a white pickup truck, smokes cigars and views America as being jaggedly splintered along ideological lines that make it hard to find common ground. Democratic calls for stricter gun control in the aftermath of mass shootings, he said, are fueling more zeal among his Republican volunteers than are the $1.5 trillion in tax cuts that Trump signed into law last year.
Since May 2017, Beaver County has lost 191 jobs. With the warmer summer weather, hiring is now on an upswing. But employers have fewer job applicants available as the labor force has shrunk by roughly 1,000 workers in the past 12 months, the result of decades of population loss that hit former steel towns such as Aliquippa, Beaver Falls and Midland.
The tax cuts haven’t stopped the outflow of people. Chatting over eggs, bacon and home fries, Kohser estimated that the tax cuts have added perhaps $1,200 to his annual household income and roughly the same to many others in the area — not likely enough on its own to rejuvenate the local economy.
The United States is full of places like Beaver County. They are areas where the currently robust national economy and job market obscure long-standing woes that generations of politicians have struggled to reverse. There are the long-shuttered factories, stagnant incomes and the departure of college-educated workers to cities and surrounding suburbs.
Many of those forgotten men and women might cheer the president for slapping tariffs on imported goods to defend U.S. factory jobs or his vow to build a wall on the Mexican border to block illegal immigration. But for struggling communities waiting for jobs to be restored, Trump’s tax cuts — which were skewed toward corporations and wealthy individuals — have yet to deliver.
During the past year, the healthiest job gains have been in counties containing such vibrant cities as Houston, Dallas, Los Angeles, Las Vegas and Seattle, all of them places that have favored Democrats.
Texas, which Trump won handily, reflects the geographic split in the economy. Within that state, Clinton — not Trump — won the counties that have accounted for bulk of that state’s job growth.
Though public opinion surveys suggest that the economy gives an advantage to Trump and the Republicans, the economy no longer packs as big a punch with the electorate.
When the Pew Research Center asked voters in June to identify the nation’s most pressing issue, more of them chose immigration, race, political gridlock or Trump himself than the economy. The proportion of people who said the economy was their top priority fell to its lowest level in more than eight years.
Sixty percent of Americans told Pew that they see their midterm vote as an act of either supporting the president (26 percent) or opposing him (34 percent). That is the highest combined number since Pew began asking such a question in 2006.
And 68 percent said that control of Congress would influence how they vote, the highest level in two decades.
Despite greater income inequality, separate research suggests the economy isn’t the only source of America’s growing cultural divide.
Since the 1970s, Americans have also moved further apart on matters of “political ideology,” according to research published in June by University of Chicago economists Marianne Bertrand and Emir Kamenica. Their work found that conservatives and liberals have become more sharply split on such issues as confidence in the government and social institutions, religious participation and stances on marriage, sex and abortion.
In Pennsylvania, many Democrats see the choices made by Trump as putting democracy itself at risk. Their fears stem in part from his administration’s initial policy of separating refugee children from their parents and his seemingly deferential relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin, whose nation interfered in the 2016 election, according to U.S. intelligence agencies.
“What I’m hearing daily is fear amongst people as to whether their democracy is slipping away from them,” said Nancy Mills, the Pennsylvania Democratic chairwoman. “I’m really hearing that more than anything else.”
She then added, “This situation at the border was really a wake-up call and frightening.”
Trump has described his crackdown on undocumented immigrants, refugees and his efforts to limit legal immigration as positive for the country. Yet the economic growth he promised would revitalize Beaver County may depend on its ability to attract immigrants as it did a century ago when the steel mills brought Germans, Italians and Eastern Europeans workers to the area.
Beaver County never fully recovered from the steel mill closures in the 1980s that caused the unemployment rate to spike at nearly 30 percent.
Many young workers with college degrees migrated east for Pittsburgh’s technology and medical care jobs. The result of this population flight is that Beaver County is rapidly aging, with a median age of 44.8 years old, compared with 37.7 nationwide and 32.9 in Pittsburgh.
If the area weren’t suffering from a dwindling population, employers say they would have more workers to hire and the county would have job gains rather than losses. Local business groups see the possibility of a vibrant future because the county sits atop a massive reserve of natural gas. On the banks of the Ohio River, an army of cranes are building a chemical plant that helps to convert the natural gas into plastic — a source of hundreds of jobs.
Republican Rep. Keith Rothfus recently sat in the Beaver County Chamber of Commerce’s wood-paneled conference room as local business owners recounted their difficulties in finding workers. A local cafe struggled to hire bakers who could start the ovens at 3 a.m. The shopping mall manager found that higher pay did little to attract better job applicants.
A congressman since 2013, Rothfus bears the calm, bespectacled manner of a professor. He faces a tough re-election battle in Pennsylvania’s newly created 17th District against Democrat Conor Lamb, who won a special election House victory earlier this year. Both Rothfus and Lamb’s current districts were redrawn this year by court order.
Sitting outside a cafe before the chamber meeting, Rothfus said there was a clear path for generating job growth: Immigrants.
“You look at areas of the country that are really thriving — there’s a significant immigrant population,” he said. “We need to do a better job of attracting immigrants here. This place was built on immigrants.”
But Rothfus has also been outspoken on the importance of tighter border security. A few weeks after the chamber meeting, he voted for a bill that, had it passed, would have imposed tougher border measures and likely curbed legal immigration.
When asked if voters would make their choice this November based on the health of the economy, Rothfus said, emphatically, yes. His belief is that the tax cuts and pullback on regulations by Trump would help give him an edge.
“I think you look at the choice we have: Do we want to have more government and higher taxes or more jobs and higher wages?” he said. “That’s a pretty compelling argument.”
As of now, Beaver County is still waiting on the job surge.

The official’s response came after Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., asked every federal immigration official at Tuesday’s hearing over family separations to answer a particular question: “Did anyone on this panel say, maybe [separating families] wasn’t such a good idea?”
After a pause, Blumenthal directed his question first to Commander Jonathan White of the U.S. Public Health Service Commissioned Corps, who said he and the Office of Refugee Resettlement raised a number of concerns in the previous year about “any policy which would result in family separation due to concerns we had about the best interest of the child as well about whether that would be operationally supportable with the bed capacity we had.”
The Democratic senator asked the commander to further explain his response in layman’s terms, asking if he told the administration that children would “suffer” as a result of its “zero tolerance” policy.
“Separation of children from their parents entails significant harm to children,” White said in response. “There’s no question that separation of children from parents entails significant potential for traumatic psychological injury to the child,” he added, shortly after.

White also said that the administration’s response was that family separation was not a policy. As stated before, there is no current law that mandates the separation of migrant children from their parents at the U.S. border.
The Trump administration implemented its “zero tolerance” policy this spring. President Donald Trump signed an executive order in June to halt the separations.
In recent weeks, lawsuits filed against the separation policy have produced testimonies from lawyers and the separated families they represent, alleging that the government’s actions resulted in trauma to their children.
In one personal declaration presented earlier this month in court, one mother said her son “is not the same since we were reunited.”
“I thought that, because he is so young he would not be traumatized by this experience, but he does not separate from me. He cries when he does not see me,” Olivia Caceres said of her 1-year-old son. “That behavior is not normal. In El Salvador he would stay with his dad or my sister and not cry. Now he cries for fear of being alone,” she wrote.
Here are several other key moments from Tuesday’s hearing in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee.
1. Committee Chairman Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, said the Trump administration “mishandled” family separations. The senator pressed the officials over reports of sexual abuse and other violations against migrants at the government’s detention facilities. It should be noted that Grassley and the panel’s top Democrat, Dianne Feinstein of California, sent a letter this week asking federal investigators to look into the alleged mistreatment and abusive practices against migrants in U.S. custody. “These allegations of abuse are extremely disturbing and must be addressed,” Grassley and Feinstein wrote in a bipartisan letter. “This is not a partisan issue as reporting suggests many have been occurring for years. Immigrant families and children kept in federal custody deserve to be treated with basic human dignity and respect and should never be subjected to these forms of abuse,” they wrote.
2. Sen. Richard Durbin, D-Ill., called for Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen’s resignation. In the hearing, the senator said it was under her watch that thousands of children were separated from their parents, while hundreds remain separated from their families. He called the administration’s “zero tolerance” policy “cruel.” “Someone, someone in this administration has to accept responsibility. We can have border security without bullying. We can be safe without treating toddlers like terrorists,” he added. Later in the hearing, Democratic Sen. Kamala Harris of California, too, called for Nielsen to resign.
3. Matthew Albence of ICE described family detention centers as “summer camp.” In response to cited reports of abuse in the government’s family detention centers, Albence said any allegation is automatically reported to a joint intake center and added that the office of inspector general has the power to investigate these allegations if it thinks there’s sufficient evidence to do so. He then said the best way to describe the centers would be to liken them to “summer camp.” He cited 24/7 food, water, and education, among other services. He also mentioned basketball courts, exercise classes, and soccer fields. “I’m very comfortable with the level of service and protection that is being provided” in these centers, Albence said.

4. Was the “zero tolerance” policy a success? Another Blumenthal moment: The senator asked if anyone in the room thought the administration’s “zero tolerance” policy had been a success. “You can just raise your hand, if you think it’s been a success,” the senator said. No one raised their hand.
5. Who defended the immigration officials? Among the senators who defended the officials during the hearing was Republican Sen. John Cornyn of Texas who blamed Congress for the administration’s inability to fix family separations, adding that those offering criticism also provide “no plausible or workable solution at all.”

That statement appeared in Foreign Policy magazine on June 5, two weeks after Nicolás Maduro was re-elected as Venezuela’s president on May 20 in an election widely considered to be rigged.
José R. Cárdenas, the former Bush administration official who wrote it, argued that “the United States and its allies should lay the groundwork” for overthrowing Maduro because “nearly two decades of creeping authoritarianism and large-scale economic mismanagement have taken a staggering toll on Venezuelans.”
Venezuelans have endured acute shortages of food, medicine and other basic necessities since 2015, thanks in large part to Maduro’s mishandling of an economic crisis originally triggered by a drop in global oil prices.
Other responses to Maduro’s re-election were equally strong, if less extreme.
The United States and Europe tightened economic sanctions on the South American country, though they have so far stopped short of crippling the country entirely by sanctioning oil exports.
How long can a cash-strapped rogue regime facing international condemnation and humanitarian crisis survive?
Our international relations analysis of Venezuela reveals five reasons why Maduro may hang onto power for quite a while.
Low international oil prices and political instability have dramatically reduced Venezuela’s revenues since Maduro took power in 2012. His country is effectively bankrupt.
Yet Maduro still commands more than enough state resources to avoid a coup. For years, the president has purchased the loyalty of Venezuela’s armed forces by giving the military loans and control over state-run enterprises.
The Ministry of Defense is now in charge of importing, producing, selling and distributing all food in Venezuela, for example. And in a country where people are starving, says retired Gen. Cliver Alcalá, the black market of “food is now a better business than drugs.”
Maduro has also stacked his cabinet with generals, personally investing them in his government’s survival. Currently, they lead nine of 33 national ministries.
Military officers suspected of plotting against Maduro have been jailed and tortured.
Just a few years ago, a powerful protest movement challenged the Maduro regime with daily demonstrations that involved hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans.
Brutally repressive tactics ended that. According to a recent report on human rights in Venezuela, police and other government forces killed 131 protesters between 2014 and 2017.
And since 2013, the Venezuelan security forces have arrested 12,000 citizens, executed 8,292 and tortured nearly 300 people. The report was written by a panel of independent international experts appointed by the Organization of American States and based on witnesses’ public hearings.
These actions amount to “crimes against humanity,” the report states, recommending that Maduro’s regime be investigated by the International Criminal Court at the Hague.
The United Nations made a similar recommendation in a June report on human rights violations there.
After years of violent repression, most people are now too afraid to protest.
The Maduro regime has neutralized almost all its domestic political opponents, too.
In August 2017, President Maduro stripped the National Assembly of its powers. The National Assembly was Venezuela’s legislative branch, dominated by opposition parties. Maduro replaced it with a regime-controlled “Constituent Assembly.”
Maduro has also ensured that his Socialist Party stays in power by blacklisting and jailing opposition candidates, shutting down news outlets that report on the regime’s actions and offering food in exchange for votes.
And pro-democracy groups that receive foreign funding are now subject to prosecution on charges of “financing terrorism” under a 2012 anti-money laundering law. The controversial legislation has handicapped Venezuelan society’s ability to organize against the regime.
Scarcity itself is a now a tool of repression in Venezuela.
Due to hyperinflation, food shortages and high prices, 93 percent of the population does not earn enough to buy food, according to a 2017 study conducted in Venezuela. Venezuelans have lost, on average, 20 pounds since the country’s humanitarian crisis began in 2015.
Almost 1 million Venezuelans have fled hunger and repression by migrating to neighboring Colombia over the past two years. Another roughly 50,000 sought asylum in the United States. Eight hundred Venezuelan refugees cross the border into Brazil every day.
The Venezuelans who remain must devote hours every day just to finding food. Starvation and endless food queues do not leave much time or energy for political resistance.
A government like Maduro’s might not last long in, say, France, because neighboring countries and the European Union would exert sufficient diplomatic, political and economic pressure to punish the rogue regime for its actions.
Research shows that economic sanctions alone, such as those recently levied against Venezuela, rarely work to coerce governments into better behavior.
But international pressure can have some positive effect under two conditions. First, the target country must be heavily dependent on international economic exchange, without other strong allies. Second, the sanctions must be multilateral.
Neither condition is true of Venezuela.
The Organization of American States has tried for two years to expel Venezuela because it is no longer a democracy. But member countries like Ecuador, Bolivia and Nicaragua – all of which have strongman leaders allied with Maduro – oppose the initiative.
Even if the group did manage to suspend Venezuela, the move would be symbolic. Venezuela has already announced its own withdrawal from the Organization of American States, calling it “a colonial body at the service of Washington.”
In any case, its Latin American neighbors are not Venezuela’s main international financial partners. China and Russia are largely keeping Maduro’s bankrupt regime afloat by buying oil concessions and extending the repayment period on loans. If Latin America isolated Venezuela in an attempt to force political changes, Maduro would just increase his reliance on these two non-democratic regimes.
We know this assessment isn’t what millions of suffering Venezuelans will want to hear, but Maduro may hold on to power for quite some time.
Until and unless all these domestic and international sources of support run out, we believe an imminent transition to democracy in Venezuela is unlikely.

What happens now?,"Facing Thursday’s court-imposed deadline to reunite more than 2,500 children between the ages of 5 and 17, the Trump administration said that it has discharged 1,820 children from government custody and reunited them with their parents.
In a court filing late July 26, the U.S. government said it expected to process “all class members found eligible for reunification.” However, hundreds of children remain separated from their parents as a result of the administration’s “zero tolerance” policy. After two separate deadlines in 30 days to reunite thousands of children affected by this policy, the fallout from the family separations is far from over.
Here’s a look at the latest numbers and what’s next for families who remain apart.
According to the Department of Justice, this is where the reunifications of families and children ages 5 to 17 stands as of 6 a.m. EDT on July 26, 2018:
The total number of children in this age group the U.S. has identified as separated at the border: 2,551.
As has been the case with previous court updates, the numbers are approximate and subject to change. Officials for the U.S. government and the American Civil Liberties Union, which has been representing the separated families, are due back in court today to appear before U.S. District Judge Dana Sabraw in San Diego.
READ MORE: 5 numbers to watch on family separations
In a statement to the PBS NewsHour, a Department of Homeland Security spokesperson said the number of eligible children now reunited is zero.
“As of Friday morning, the administration can confirm that we have reunified all eligible parents in ICE custody with children,” the statement read. “The administration continues to comply in good faith with the court’s requests while protecting the safety and well-being of all children in our care.”
Before the latest numbers were released, the ACLU’s Lee Gelernt said that the government “shouldn’t be proud of the work they’re doing on reunification,” while further criticizing the administration’s “cruel, inhumane policy.”
The U.S. government said 711 children were found “either not eligible for reunification or not available for discharge at this time.” Officials broke down that number as follows:
The ACLU said in Thursday’s joint filing that while it can see that many families have been reunited, the government has yet to provide them with sufficient information that would allow the group to verify and locate the reunited families.
ACLU has signaled that it will start focusing on families that remain separated outside this court order.
“Close to a thousand parents remain separated from their children,” ACLU said in Thursday’s court filing. That approximate number includes hundreds of parents who were removed from the U.S. possibly without their children, children who were deemed “ineligible” for this court order, and parents whose cases are still “under review.”
Among this group are also 40 children with no discernable parental information, name or location attached. “These are troubling cases,” ACLU said in the filing, requesting that the government explain its efforts to the court on how it plans make contact with these parents. “There is a risk that these children will be indefinitely separated from their parents,” ACLU wrote.
The group also requested that the government elaborate on why dozens of parents were deemed “ineligible” for reunification. Some parents, for example, were not reunited because of their criminal history, the government said. Information about these exclusions “was too general to be useful,” ACLU said.
Also, remember, there’s uncertainty about the “ineligible” youngest children — under age 5 — that remain separated from their parents past the July 10 deadline for reunification. ACLU wants additional information on this age group as well.
The timeline on reuniting those still separated is unclear.
In Friday’s hearing, Judge Sabraw is also expected to settle the disagreement by both parties over the deadline by which families must decide the next steps in the waiting period after they’re reunited and before they’re readied for deportation.
ACLU is hoping the judge bans deportations of families slated for removal for seven days after they’re reunified because, the group argued, parents must have “sufficient time to consult about what might be the most consequential decision of their lives.”
The government, however, has argued for a shorter waiting period, saying the proposed extension of time by the ACLU would strap the already limited bed space at the country’s detention centers and cost taxpayers an estimated $319 per day for each detained family member. U.S. officials have said they want parents to make a decision to leave the country with or without their children within 48 hours of being reunited.
Earlier this week, the Department of Homeland Security inspector general responded to lawmakers’ concerns over family separations, saying it was “broadly reviewing” the issue.
The DHS internal watchdog also said it would look into the conditions of detention facilities belonging to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection.

https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/israel-evacuates-syrian-volunteers-stranded-in-frontier-area,refugee,1119,2018-07-22T09:43:44-04:00,"Aron Heller, Associated Press",Israel evacuates Syrian volunteers stranded in frontier area,"JERUSALEM — The Israeli military evacuated hundreds of Syrian rescue workers known as White Helmets from the volatile frontier area on the Golan Heights and transported them to Jordan, following a request by the United States and its European allies, officials said Sunday.
It was the first such Israeli intervention in Syria’s lengthy civil war, now in its eighth year.
Jordan confirmed the Syrian citizens entered its territory to be resettled in Western countries in weeks. Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi said the total number of evacuees was 422, even though the initial request was to evacuate 800. It was unclear what happened to the remainder.
Safadi later tweeted that Jordan approved the evacuations after a pledge from Britain, Germany and Canada that the Syrian evacuees would be resettled in three months.
The White Helmets and their families had been stranded along the frontier with the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights following the Syrian government offensive in southwestern Syria which began in June.
The group, which operates in opposition-held areas, is often targeted in Syrian government attacks on its members and facilities. The Syrian government considers the group a “terrorist” organization because it works in areas controlled by its opponents, where state institutions and services are non-existent.

The Israeli military said the overnight operation was an “exceptional humanitarian gesture” done at the request of the United States and its European allies due to “an immediate threat to the (Syrians’) lives.”
The military said its actions did not reflect a change to Israel’s non-intervention policy in Syria’s war, where all the warring parties are considered hostile.

The British International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt and Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the Syrian volunteers and their family “have been able to leave Syria for safety” following a joint diplomatic effort by Britain and its international partners.
“The White Helmets have saved over 115,000 lives during the Syrian conflict, at great risk to their own,” the two officials said in a statement Sunday. “We judged that, in these particular circumstances, the volunteers required immediate protection. ”
The evacuees are being assisted by the U.N. refugee agency in Jordan, pending international resettlement, they said.
Jordanian Foreign Ministry’s spokesman Mohammed al-Kayed said the Syrians would remain in a closed area in Jordan for three months before moving on to Britain, Germany and Canada.

Raed Saleh, head of the Syrian Civil Defense as the White Helmets are also known, said a number of volunteers and their families were evacuated from a dangerous, besieged area and had reached Jordan. He did not elaborate on the numbers of those evacuated.
The Syrian government and Russia view the White Helmets as “agents” of foreign powers and have regularly accused them of staging rescue missions or chemical attacks. Syrian state TV Al-Ikhbariya reported the Israeli evacuation of the White Helmets, calling it a “scandal” and saying “terrorist groups” now have “zero options.”
The Associated Press first reported on Friday that U.S. officials were finalizing plans to evacuate several hundred Syrian civil defense workers and their families from southwest Syria as Russian-backed government forces closed in on the Quneitra province, along the Golan Heights frontier.
The officials said the White Helmets, who have enjoyed backing from the United States and other Western nations for years, were likely to be targeted by Syrian forces as they retook control of the southwest. Evacuation plans were accelerated after last week’s NATO summit in Brussels.
Since the Syrian government offensive began in June, the area along the frontier in the Golan Heights has been the safest in the southwestern region, attracting hundreds of displaced because of its location along the disengagement line with Israel, demarcated in 1974 after a war. Israel has occupied the Golan Heights since 1967. Thousands of civilians had taken shelter near the frontier to escape the government offensive.
The Syrian government is unlikely to fire there or carry out airstrikes for fear of an Israeli response.
Meanwhile, Syrian forces kept up their offensive, pounding the southern tip of the southwestern region where an Islamic State-affiliated group still holds territory.
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the bombing — 130 airstrikes since Saturday — displaced 20,000 civilians while an estimated 10,000 remain trapped in the area controlled by the militants, with their fate unknown.
Over the last month, Syrian government forces aided by Russian air power have swept through southwestern Syria to consolidate government control over this strategic corner of the country that straddles the border with Jordan and the frontier with Israeli-occupied Golan Heights.
With its new advances, government forces are, for the first time since the civil war began in 2011, retaking this territory from the rebels and restoring their positions along the disengagement line in the Golan Heights.
Since the offensive began, Jordan said it will not open its borders to the newly displaced Syrians. Jordan hosts at least 650,000 registered Syrian refugees, according to the U.N., but Amman says a similar number of undocumented Syrians are also in the kingdom.
During the latest Syrian government offensive, which began on June 19, around 300,000 Syrians have been displaced, heading toward the sealed Israeli and Jordanian borders in what the U.N. said was the largest single displacement since the Syrian civil war started in 2011.
Some Syrians have opted to be evacuated to northern Idlib province, where the opposition still holds territory. Thousands of armed men and their families were evacuated over the weekend. The Observatory said two buses carrying evacuees were held up by a pro-Syrian government militia, apparently after they went off road.
Panicked passengers, fearing for their lives, posted pictures of the militia surrounding their buses on social media.
Israel has been sending aid into Syria for several years and has provided medical treatment to thousands of Syrians who reached the Golan Heights frontier. In the past two years, the Israeli military says it has delivered more than 1,500 tons of food, 250 tons of clothing and nearly a million liters of fuel.
The Israeli military said it will continue to aid those in need but won’t allow a massive influx of refugees into the country.

These are children who need frequent touching and bonding with a parent and naps every few hours, and some were of breastfeeding age, medical experts say. They’re unable to speak and still learning when it’s day versus night.
“For babies, the basics are really important. It’s the holding, the proper feeding, proper nurturing,” said Shadi Houshyar, who directs early childhood and child welfare initiatives at advocacy group Families USA.
The number of infants under age 1 involved has been rising — up threefold from 24 infants in the fiscal year that ended last Sept. 30, and 46 infants the year before.
The Justice Department data show that a total of 1,500 “unaccompanied” children, from newborns to age 3, have been called in to immigration court since Oct. 1, 2015.
Roughly three-fourths of the children involved are represented by a lawyer and they have to make their case that they should stay in the United States.
Officials who review such deportation cases say most children under 1 cross the border with a parent and their deportation cases proceed together.

But some of the infants were deemed “unaccompanied” only after law enforcement separated them from their parents during the Trump administration’s “zero-tolerance” immigration policy. The children were sent to facilities across the U.S. under the supervision of the Department of Health and Human Services.
“This is to some extent a … crisis of the creation of the government,” said Robert Carey, who previously headed the Office of Refugee Resettlement, which takes custody of unaccompanied minors. “It’s a tragic and ironic turn of events.”
Younger children are also considered unaccompanied if they enter the U.S. with an older family member who is not yet 18. The data do not clarify which children arrived that way or which were separated from their parents.
The Justice Department did not respond to a request for further data about where the children are housed. They could be in a foster care home, at a group home, with a relative or sponsor or reunited with a parent. HHS, which operates the refugee resettlement office, did not provide comment by publication time.
In previous statements, the government has argued that separation — and its consequences — are unfortunate but unavoidable under the law.
“There is a surefire way to avoid separation from your children. Present yourself legally … or stay back at your home country, and go through the process others do,” HHS Secretary Alex Azar said on a media call earlier this month. “None of us want children separated from their parents. I want no children in our care and custody.”

The number of unaccompanied children called in to court since Oct. 1, 2015, swells to 2,900 if kids up to 5 are included. The total will rise between now and Sept. 30, when the fiscal year ends, noted Susan Long, a statistician at Syracuse University and director of TRAC, a repository of immigration and federal court data. There’s also an ongoing backlog in entering the data.
In June, a district judge in San Diego ordered the government to reunify families within a month, specifically directing them to unite children younger than 5 with parents by July 10.
HHS reunited about half of those children by July 12 — 57 out of 103. Others, the government said, could not be placed with a parent, citing in some cases “serious criminal history” or parents currently being in jail.
In 12 cases, those children’s parents had already been deported. In another, the government had failed to figure out where the child’s parent was located, and in another, the parent had a “communicable disease,” HHS said.
The Department of Homeland Security, which issues the court orders, also did not respond to a request for comment.
In the removal cases, children have no right to an appointed lawyer, but rather to a list of legal aid attorneys that the child’s current caregiver can contact.
And young children rarely know the details of why they fled their home country, especially without a parent present, noted Eileen Blessinger, a Virginia-based immigration lawyer who has been aiding parents.
“Think about it as a parent. You’re not going to tell your child they might be killed, right?” she said. “A lot of the kids don’t know.”
Immigration court, which is an administrative unit of the Department of Justice, is different from typical courts. It handles “respondents” who may be too young to speak, but has no social workers or legal remedies focused on the best interest of a child, said Lenni Benson, a New York Law School professor and founder of the Safe Passage Project, which provides legal services to migrant youth.
“An immigration judge has no discretion,” Benson said. “There’s no ‘I’m hearing the mom wants the kid, I’m going to decide what’s best,’” she said. Instead, “it’s ‘the government has charged you with being removable from the U.S. Do you have evidence to show you have a right to be here?’”
Benson recounted being in immigration court in 2014 when a judge asked for a crying baby to be removed from the courtroom. She said she paused to inform the judge that the baby was the next respondent on the docket — and asked that the child’s grandmother stand in.

The stakes for the babies, and any migrant fleeing violence, are high, said Paul Wickham Schmidt, a former immigration judge who retired in 2016 after 13 years on the bench in Arlington, Va.
“Final orders of deportation have consequences,” he said. “For something that has a very serious result, this system has been described as death penalty cases in traffic court.”
Ashley Tabaddor, president of the National Association of Immigration Judges and a judge specializing in juvenile cases in Los Angeles, acknowledged that the administration narrowed a directive on how much judges can assist juveniles in court. Still, she said, judges do their best to ensure that young children get a fair hearing.
Justice Department data show that asylum denials are at a nearly 10-year high at 42 percent, and the Associated Press reported that the administration has raised the bar for making a successful case.
At the same time, children can be strapped for resources, Blessinger said.
She described one client whose 7-year-old daughter received legal support from a New York-based charity. Even in that case, she said, the organization acted simply as a “friend of the court” — rather than a full-fledged attorney — requesting delays in proceedings until the child and mother could be reunited. That finally happened Tuesday night, she said.
“It’s the saddest experience. These people are not going to be recovering anytime soon,” she said. “The parents are crying even after they’re reunited.”"
https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/judge-temporarily-halts-deportation-of-reunified-families,refugee,549,2018-07-16T15:40:13-04:00,"Elliot Spagat, Associated Press",Judge temporarily halts deportation of reunified families,"SAN DIEGO — A federal judge on Monday ordered a temporary halt to any deportations of immigrant families who were reunited after being separated by the Trump administration at the border.
U.S. District Judge Dana Sabraw imposed a delay of at least a week after a request from the American Civil Liberties Union, which cited “persistent and increasing rumors … that mass deportations may be carried out imminently and immediately upon reunification.”
Justice Department attorney Scott Stewart opposed the delay but did not address the rumors in court. He said he would respond later in writing. The judge gave the department until next Monday.
Late last month, Sabraw ordered the government to reunite thousands of children and parents who were forcibly separated in recent months under the Trump administration’s “zero tolerance” policy toward those who illegally cross into the U.S. He set a deadline of July 10 for roughly 100 children under age 5 and gave the government until July 26 to reunite more than 2,500 older youngsters.
The Trump administration reunited about half the under-5 children by last week, saying that in many of the remaining cases, the adults had criminal records or were determined not to be the youngsters’ parents at all.

In asking for a delay in deportations, the ACLU said parents need a week after being reunified with their children to decide whether to pursue asylum.
The decision “cannot be made until parents not only have had time to fully discuss the ramifications with their children, but also to hear from the child’s advocate or counsel, who can explain to the parent the likelihood of the child ultimately prevailing in his or her own asylum case if left behind in the U.S. (as well as where the child is likely to end up living),” the ACLU said.
Late Friday, the judge said he was having second thoughts about whether the government was acting in good faith, after the Trump administration warned that speeding up the reunification process by dropping DNA testing could endanger children.
But on Monday, Jonathan White of the Office of Refugee Resettlement, who is overseeing the government’s effort, assured the judge that some reunifications of older children have already occurred, and “it is our intent to reunify children promptly.” He went into detail on how the process was working.
Sabraw praised White, saying his testimony on the reunification plan gave him great comfort. “What is in place is a great start to making a large number of reunifications happen very, very quickly,” the judge said.
Justice Department attorneys also assured Sabraw the children were well cared for, offering him a visit to a shelter if he wanted.
The judge replied that the main concern wasn’t whether the children were well cared for.
“Obviously the concern that has been at issue has been the passage of time,” he said. “No matter how nice the environment is, it’s the act of separation from a parent, particularly with young children, that matters.”
Sabraw has scheduled three more hearings over the next two weeks to ensure compliance with his order.

What about the others?,"The Trump administration said the youngest migrant children separated from their parents under its “zero tolerance” policy have now been reunited with their families.
In a call with reporters today, officials from the Departments of Homeland Security and Health and Human Services said 57 children under 5 were reunited with their parents, as of July 12.
However, about half of the more than 100 children under age 5 who have been separated from their parents were deemed ineligible for reunification because of unspecified safety concerns and issues, officials said Thursday. The agencies, along with the Justice Department, said 46 of the 103 children remain separated from their parents. This is an increase from the 27 children deemed ineligible by the government earlier this week.
Here’s how the government broke the numbers down:
There are 46 children ineligible for reunification. Of those children:
22 children remain separated due to “safety concerns posed by the adults in question”:
24 children are ineligible for reunification because of the circumstances of the adult they arrived with:
“Throughout the reunification process, our goal has been the well-being of the children and returning them to a safe environment,” a statement released this morning from multiple agencies said. “Of course, there remains a tremendous amount of hard work and similar obstacles facing our teams in reuniting the remaining families. The Trump administration does not approach this mission lightly.”
What advocates say
The ACLU issued a response soon after the government’s update: “The Trump administration says it has reunited 57 children under 5 that it forcibly separated from their parents. The deadline to reunify all the children under 5 was July 10. The government did not even reunite these 57 children by that deadline.”
Lee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU’s Immigrants’ Rights Project, added, “If in fact 57 children have been reunited because of the lawsuit, we could not be more happy for those families. But make no mistake about it: the government missed the deadline even for these 57 children. Accordingly, by the end of the day we will decide what remedies to recommend to the court for the non-compliance.”
What’s next?
Officials told reporters that the 46 children deemed ineligible for reunification will remain in U.S. custody until they’re placed with a family member or HHS-approved sponsor. No timeline was given on how long this could take, but it’s part of the HHS’ typical process for the thousands of unaccompanied minors who are transferred to the care of the agency’s Office of Refugee Resettlement.
READ MORE: What happens when a child arrives at the U.S. border?
The government has been under court-imposed deadlines for reunification, stemming from a lawsuit brought by the American Civil Liberties Union on behalf of a woman who was separated from her child under the policy. President Donald Trump signed an executive order on June 20 that halted the separations, and the government has since been mandated to reunify families that were separated.
Earlier this week, the government missed a June 10 deadline for reunifying all children under 5. U.S. District Judge Dana Sabraw told the government to continue working on reunifying families. “These are firm deadlines. They’re not aspirational goals,” the judge said Tuesday, the day of the initial deadline, saying the government still had hours in the day to reunify the youngest migrants affected by the administration’s policy.
Amna Nawaz talked with Lee Gelernt of the ACLU’s Immigrants’ Rights Project on Tuesday when the government didn’t meet its first court-imposed deadline on reunification.
What about the rest of the separated minors?
For children older than 5, a second deadline has been set for July 26. That’s about two weeks away for “under 3,000” children age 5 to 17.
Gelernt told the NewsHour on Tuesday that the ACLU hopes “that now the government has figured out some basic process for doing these reunifications. … I think it’s an enormous task, as the judge said. But, on the other hand, it’s a mess the government made. They really need to fix it. We are more than happy to help in any way we can.”

Protests in Daraa in 2011 against the government’s mistreatment of teenage detainees ignited a national revolt against decades of authoritarian rule. Syria eventually descended into a full-blown civil war that has claimed the lives of some 400,000 people and displaced more than 5 million as refugees.
Ahmad Masalmeh, a media activist formerly based in Daraa, said fighters in the city had accepted an offer of amnesty from the government, and let back in the state institutions and symbols of Assad’s rule.
Rebels refusing to accept the deal will be exiled with their families to other rebel-held parts of the country.
The agreement follows a template imposed by the government and its Russian and Iranian backers that has forced hundreds of thousands of Syrians, including media activists, army defectors, and draft dodgers and their family members to give up their homes to lift the sieges against their cities.
Human rights monitors say the arrangements amount to a program of political and demographic engineering in Syria to secure Assad’s rule.
Government forces launched an offensive to recapture southwest Syria and the areas neighboring Jordan and Israel on June 19. They surrounded Daraa’s rebel-held quarters on Monday. Dozens have been killed in the campaign, including 162 civilians, according to Rami Abdurrahman, director of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights — among them women and children.
Daraa governor Mohamad al-Hanous said government forces were in control of 80 percent of the city, according to the government-linked Central Military Media outlet, while Syrian state media reported late Wednesday that rebels in Daraa had agreed to surrender their heavy and medium weapons.
Under the terms of the agreement, Russia will deploy military police to maintain order in Daraa and facilitate the transition back to government rule, said a media activist inside who asked for anonymity out of concern for his safety.
Russian mediators are warning fighters and civilians against leaving Daraa for Idlib, the northwest Syrian province where over a million displaced Syrians are living in dire conditions and exposed to government airstrikes and the possibility of a future offensive.
“Idlib is a crematory,” the activist said Russian mediators warned him.
Humanitarian groups say more than 300,000 people have been displaced by the government’s southern offensive, moving toward the Jordanian border and to Quneitra, a province that borders Israel.
Israel and Jordan’s borders are closed to refugees, and the aid group Oxfam said Thursday it was unable to deliver enough aid across the Jordan border to meet the needs of the internally displaced residents.
The circumstances are especially perilous for journalists and media activists, who say they fear for their lives if they are captured by government troops.
The Committee to Protect Journalists said Wednesday at least 70 journalists were trapped in southwest Syria and required protection.
Syria is one of the most dangerous countries in the world for journalists, according to CPJ. At least 120 journalists have been killed in the country in relation to their work since the conflict began in 2011, according to CPJ research. At the time of CPJ’s most recent prison census, at least seven journalists were in Syrian state prisons while many others are missing.
Masalmeh, the media activist, said he was smuggled out of southwest Syria to Jordan four days ago, leaving his parents and extended family in Daraa.
He said he had not heard from them in two days."

The separation of families at the U.S.-Mexico border and Italy’s refusal to let shipwrecked migrants disembark in its ports illustrate the hardening positions on border control in Washington and European capitals.
Lost in the heated political debate is the fact that migrant arrivals in Europe across the Mediterranean from Africa and Turkey are at their lowest level in five years, while arrests on the U.S.-Mexico border — an imperfect but widely used gauge of illegal crossings — are far below levels seen two decades ago.

“The numbers don’t support the hysteria,” said Joel Millman, a spokesman for the Geneva, Switzerland-based International Organization for Migration. “Politicians know what moves voters, and this is extremely effective in moving voters.”
In both the U.S. and Europe, immigration is increasingly a key political fault line. One side accuses those cracking down on illegal immigration of scapegoating immigrants for problems such as crime and unemployment, even when the correlation is weak. The other side says politicians are simply recognizing voters’ concerns about national identity and poor integration that have long been ignored.
In Europe, the liberal immigration policies that many governments implemented until recently never had widespread popular support, said Ivar Arpi, a conservative editorial writer at Swedish newspaper Svenska Dagbladet. But because Europeans cared more about other issues, such as the economy or education, there was no serious backlash.
That changed in 2015, when 1 million people — most of them from Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan — crossed into Europe from Turkey and used the lack of border controls in the European Union to roam freely from the Balkans into Austria and onward to Germany and Scandinavia. That surge and the pressures it put on the destination countries pushed migration to the top of Europe’s political agenda, where it has remained since.
“2015 fundamentally changed Europe. But it is hard to know how big a change is when you still are in the middle of it,” Arpi said. “Nationalism or globalism, this is the new divide between people. It trumps left-right.”
Immigration is a major theme ahead of Sweden’s elections in September, just as it has been in a series of European votes in the past two years, including Britain’s referendum on leaving the EU. Far-right and anti-migrant parties have made gains in Austria, France and Germany, while Hungary’s Prime Minister Viktor Orban, known for his tough stance on migrants, easily won re-election in April.
Just weeks after taking office in Italy’s coalition government, the League — a party vowing to put “Italians first” — has forced other EU nations to grapple with the issue of sea arrivals, which have placed a disproportionate burden on Mediterranean countries in dealing with those seeking a new life in Europe. Things came to a head when League leader Matteo Salvini, Italy’s interior minister and deputy prime minister, closed Italian ports to private ships picking up migrants sailing from North Africa in flimsy boats, saying those volunteer rescuers act as de facto “taxi services” for human smuggling networks. As a result, two rescue vessels have had to carry rescued migrants on a much longer journey to Spain, and another spent days in limbo off Malta until European countries agreed to share the responsibility for the more than 200 people on board.
The crackdown comes as the number of those trying to make the perilous crossing is dwindling. Sea arrivals in Italy were already down by 80 percent when the new government took office. Across the Mediterranean, about 45,000 migrants arrived by sea in Italy, Greece and Spain in the first half of the year, according to the U.N. refugee agency. That’s the lowest level since 2013 and down from about 100,000 in the same period last year. So far this year, 1,400 migrants are believed to have died trying to cross the Mediterranean.
Even German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who refused to close Germany’s borders at the height of the migrant crisis in 2015, has toughened her stance. To salvage her government from a rift over migration, she has agreed to set up transit centers to process migrants and potentially turn them away at the Austrian border. German police recorded fewer than 5,000 illegal crossings of that border in January-May, compared with more than 60,000 in the same period in 2016.
Guy Verhofstadt, a former Belgian prime minister and current president of an alliance of liberals in the European Parliament, last week ridiculed concerns over what he referred to as a “so-called” crisis.
“Why I am saying so-called? Because I don’t think it is a real migration crisis what we are living in Europe for the moment,” he told the assembly, noting that the flow is a tiny fraction of the 68 million displaced people worldwide, according to U.N. figures.

In the U.S., President Donald Trump has made immigration a big issue, with his “zero tolerance” policy to criminally prosecute anyone caught crossing the border illegally. Because children can’t be in jail with their parents, more than 2,300 families caught by Border Patrol were separated, generating outrage in the U.S. and abroad. The move has drawn condemnation from religious, humanitarian and political leaders.
The U.S. Border Patrol made about 304,000 arrests on the U.S.-Mexico border in 2017, compared with the record high of 1.64 million in 2000. The highest number this decade was 447,000 in 2010, which is still dramatically lower than what the U.S. experienced in the 1990s and 2000s when the Border Patrol routinely exceeded more than 1 million arrests of immigrants at the Mexico border.
The Pew Research Center, which studies migration trends in the U.S., determined in 2014 that more Mexican immigrants are leaving the U.S. than arriving, which is part of the reason for the slowing rates. The collapse of the housing market a decade ago also contributed as the U.S. economy tanked and jobs dried up.
But one element of immigration into the U.S. that has surged significantly in recent years is the arrival of children who travel without their parents from Central America. In 2010, the U.S. had about 18,000 unaccompanied children taken into custody at its borders, increasing to 68,000 four years later and remaining above 40,000 each year since.
Charles Hirschman, a professor at the University of Washington in Seattle who has researched immigration in the U.S., said the popular and political response to immigration is only “loosely connected” to the volume of arrivals. Economic insecurity among workers and “unscrupulous political leaders” who use fear of migrants to mobilize followers, are much more important factors, he said.
“Political leaders who try to hew to a more balanced perceptive are usually at a political disadvantage,” he said in a reference to Merkel. “Fear is a very potent political weapon.”

The Department of Health and Human Services confirmed that child separations have stopped. “We are not receiving any more referrals as a result of the zero tolerance policy,” an HHS spokesman said in an email to the PBS NewsHour.
This comes more than two weeks after President Donald Trump signed an executive order that ends family separations, but still requires criminal prosecution for illegal entry. The Trump administration said it will detain families together for the duration of their immigration proceedings. Meanwhile, more than 2,000 children are still believed to be separated from their families, among more than 11,000 children who are under HHS’ care.
A federal judge ruled on June 26 that the Trump administration must reunite families separated by the policy within 30 days of the court order, sooner for children younger than 5 years old. That first deadline for the youngest separated minors was July 10. The Trump administration missed that deadline.

HHS Secretary Alex Azar, echoing the sentiments of other agencies heads involved in the process, blamed the country’s existing laws and disputed the notion that the “zero tolerance” policy’s rollout has led to confusion stemming from its implementation.
“Any confusion is due to a broken immigration system and court orders,” Azar told reporters on a July phone call. “It’s not here.”
Numbers matter, and here are a few that you should know about. We will update this post as the numbers change.
The number of children that have been received by the HHS’ Office of Refugee Resettlement division.
For now, this is one of the numbers HHS and other agencies are providing in response to requests to better understand how many children have been separated under the “zero tolerance” policy. This number includes all children in the agency’s care, both those who were separated and those who arrived unaccompanied.
An important note: All minors referred to the Office of Refugee Resettlement, including those separated under the Trump policy, are classified as “unaccompanied alien children.”
The number of children separated from their parents under the Trump administration’s “zero tolerance” policy.
Earlier this month, HHS head Alex Azar told reporters on a media call that the latest estimate of children believed to have been separated at the border is “under 3,000.”
Azar said that the “under 3,000” estimate is a “maximum” figure that could include children who were separated from their parents before they arrived at the border. The secretary said officials are reviewing the thousands of case files to get a better understanding of exactly how many children were separated by DHS officials and then transferred into HHS’ care.
This comes nine days after Azar told reporters that 2,047 children had been separated from their parents and remained under the agency’s care.
That was six down from the number provided June 20 when HHS reported 2,053 separated minors in its custody. That was also the last time immigration officials provided a specific break-out number, and based on recent subsequent correspondence with the agency, it appears to no longer be providing this number.
Initially, DHS officials also said that between May 5 and June 9, a total 2,342 children were separated from their parents.
Of the “under 3,000” children separated from their parents, 2,551 are between ages 5 and 17, according to the latest court update from the federal government.
The government has until July 26 to reunite all eligible minors with their parents. As of July 19, the Trump administration said it has reunited 364 from this group, according to its court filing.
Bob Carey, the former director of the HHS Office of Refugee Resettlement, the division currently caring for the children, joins Amna Nawaz to discuss the logistical challenges of reunification.
The government has been under court mandate to provide regular updates on the reunification process for the thousands of separated minors under U.S. custody. Among the other numbers provided to a federal judge on July 19:
At least 1,606 parents may be deemed eligible for reunification with their children:
The U.S. has identified 908 adults that are either ineligible for reunification or their eligibility status is not yet known:
The court update on Friday also said 719 of the parents face a “final order of removal.”
In a July 24 update, the federal government said 463 migrant parents are no longer in the U.S. The filing said these individuals’ cases were “under review” because they may have been deported without their children. This, the government argued, could hinder efforts to reunite separated minors with this group of parents by Thursday’s deadline.
The government may provide more information in another hearing Tuesday.
Of the “under 3,000” children separated from their parents, 103 are under age 5, according to the latest numbers in a multi-agency statement from the federal government.
The government missed a court-ordered deadline of July 10 for reunification for the youngest migrants. U.S. District Judge Dana Sabraw told the government to continue working on reunifying families. “These are firm deadlines. They’re not aspirational goals,” the judge said Tuesday, declining the government’s request to extend the deadline for reunification.
Of the 103 children eligible for reunification, 57 have been reunited with their parents, while the other 46 remain separated. The government said this is because 22 children were ineligible for reunification because of “safety concerns posed by the adults in question.” The Justice Department said some of the adults had charges or convictions for child cruelty, kidnapping and murder, among other reasons. Another 24 children are also not eligible due to the parents’ circumstances; this could be because the parents have already been deported or are in custody for unspecified “other offenses.”
News Release ➡️ Trump Administration Completes Reunification for Eligible Children Under Age 5: https://t.co/mnONXHs13F pic.twitter.com/Xj0IX6pvAq
— HHS.gov (@HHSGov) July 12, 2018
Late Wednesday, HHS provided a quick update on the reunification status: “We anticipate that, as of the early morning on July 12, we will have reunified all children under age 5 who are eligible under the court order for reunification with parents in the United States.” The government provided a more detailed breakdown of the children Thursday morning.
The American Civil Liberties Union, who brought the original lawsuit that led to the current deadlines, responded to the government’s latest update, saying the administration failed to reunite the dozens of eligible children by the July 10 deadline.
“If in fact 57 children have been reunited because of the lawsuit, we could not be more happy for those families,” Lee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU’s Immigrants’ Rights Project, said in a statement. “But make no mistake about it: the government missed the deadline even for these 57 children. Accordingly, by the end of the day we will decide what remedies to recommend to the court for the non-compliance.”
The court deadline for the government to provide a list of separated children between the ages of 5 and 17 was today. That list has not been submitted. The judge said in a meeting with both parties on Friday that the government must provide a list that includes the names, ages and locations of all children and adults that fall within that category by 9 a.m. PT Monday.
The court also ordered the government to provide the ACLU with the time, day and location of each family’s reunification at least 12 hours before it occurs.
This is the number of U.S. Border Patrol arrests for the month of June.
The U.S. Border Patrol released the latest arrest numbers, showing that agents made 42,565 arrests of people crossing at the U.S.-Mexico border during the month of June. This number also includes those defined as “inadmissibles”: people without prior authorization to enter who present themselves at ports of entry, including asylum seekers.
Border Patrol uses the term “apprehensions” to describe those who illegally cross the border between ports of entry.
The data shows a drop in arrests at the border, after a trend of increases across the last three months or more. The official CBP numbers are released on a monthly basis.

The drop in arrests could indicate that “zero tolerance” is acting as a deterrent. But other factors could be responsible too. For example, extreme weather patterns have been known to slow the number of people illegally crossing into the U.S.
Michelle Mittelstadt of the Migration Policy Institute argued for taking a long view when looking at immigration data.
“On a topline level … one can use numbers to basically make any argument,” Mittelstadt said. “It’s important, if you want to get an accurate picture of what’s happening at the border, to not just do a comparison of one month to the prior month or one month to the same month a year earlier.”
Border apprehensions for fiscal year 2017 followed a downward trend of lower-than-average arrests since 2007.
The Trump administration has pointed to the numbers of border arrests when defending its policies. During his first month in office, Trump said there was a 40 percent decline in illegal immigration. Some experts attributed that decline to winter weather.
But as months went on, border arrests began to increase. By 2018, the number of illegal crossings inched closer to the levels seen in May 2014 when more than 68,000 arrests were made, amid the surge of Central American families and children showing up at the border.
The peak year for apprehensions at the southwest border, however, was the year 2000 when there were more than 1.6 million apprehensions, Mittelstadt said. These numbers, too, predated the official use of “inadmissibles” in CBP data.

Now, in a new filing, they’re asking the federal government to provide more immediate information and access to those detained under the policy on an “expedited schedule.”
The motion filed Monday came with more than 900 pages of declarations that included powerful personal testimonies from parents, children and other family members who were directly impacted by the Trump policy. It also included declarations from the state attorneys general offices, elected representatives, advocates and child and immigration experts who have dealt with families separated at the border.
The PBS NewsHour’s Lisa Desjardins shares chilling first-hand accounts of family separations at the border.
Trump signed an executive order on June 20, halting the separation practice and ordering families to be detained together instead. But in a statement, the attorneys general criticized the administration’s response. “Hundreds of separated parents are in federal custody and the Administration can move them to other facilities at any time without notice,” they said in the statement.
The PBS NewsHour reached out to the federal agencies involved in the separation of families at the border — the Departments of Homeland Security and Health and Human Services; U.S. Customs and Border Protection, and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement — for a response. All said they were unable to comment on ongoing litigation. The Department of Justice also declined to comment.
Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said Thursday the agency was prepared to reunite separated children with their parents, and would prioritize children under age 5 starting next week. But Azar, speaking to reporters, said families that have been reunited could still experience long stays in detention.
It’s unclear how the lawsuit filed by the attorneys general would impact the administration’s efforts to reunify separated families.
The NewsHour read through all 99 declarations and pulled 12 that offer a window into the family separations at the border.
“(My son) is not the same since we were reunited. I thought that, because he is so young he would not be traumatized by this experience, but he does not separate from me. He cries when he does not see me. That behavior is not normal. In El Salvador he would stay with his dad or my sister and not cry. Now he cries for fear of being alone.”
— Olivia Caceres was separated from her 1-year-old son in November at a legal point of entry. The boy’s father, who was seeking asylum, remains detained, Caceres said. It took three months for Caceres to get her son back from government custody. According to her testimony, she said that after reuniting with her toddler, “he continued to cry when we got home and would hold on to my leg and would not let me go. When I took off his clothes he was full of dirt and lice. It seemed like they had not bathed him the 85 days he was away from us.”
“They told me to sign a consent form to take my daughter, but that it did not matter whether or not I signed, because they were going to take her either way.”
— Angelica Rebeca Gonzalez-Garcia was apprehended and separated from her 7-year-old daughter in May. She hasn’t seen her since. She said officers at the border told her she would never see her daughter again, and that she had “‘endangered’ her by bringing her here,” she wrote. “I cannot express the pain and fear I felt at that point,” she wrote. Gonzalez-Garcia said she has spoken by phone to her daughter, who is currently in a shelter and said that she had been hit by a boy, was bruised and had gotten sick there.
“…One of the officers asked me, “In Guatemala do they celebrate Mother’s Day?” When I answered yes he said, “then Happy Mother’s Day” because the next Sunday was Mother’s Day. I lowered my head so that my daughter would not see the tears forming in my eyes. That particular act of cruelty astonished me then as it does now. I could not understand why they hated me so much, or wanted to hurt me so much,” she wrote as part of her statement.
“For eight days I was held in a small room with over 60 men. We called it The Freezer because the air conditioning was so strong that we felt like ice. The men got sick inside and we had to sleep, use the toilet, and pass the time all in the same tiny room.”
— “L. Doe,” the father to a 5-year-old son and 1.5-year-old daughter, wrote that he and his family presented themselves at a port of entry to apply for asylum. They were separated immediately. He remains in detention. “My thoughts run in circles, and I feel as though I am going to lose my mind. I need to see my family and take care of them.”
“[The children] did not have shoes or blankets in the detention center, and there were people in the cells that had to sleep standing up. They did not have enough to eat either, and could not drink the water, because of the chlorine they added to it … the incarcerated children were insulted – called named such as “animals” and “donkeys.”
— Ludin Jimenez said she was separated from her children, age 9 and 17, when she crossed the border in May seeking asylum. The family was reunited June 28 in Boston. She wrote that she was kept in a cell with nearly 50 other mothers. “The officers told them that they could not eat because they were asking about their children. There was a pregnant woman who fainted from hunger.”
According to her statement, Jimenez was not allowed “to bathe or brush her teeth for the eight days that she spent in the ‘dog pound.’”
“There was an immigration officer who was a good person. He said that he understood what was going on, but could not help. He brought them cookies, since he knew they did not get enough to eat.”
“I am worried about M.’s mental health when he learns that we have to start the process again and that he is not going to be released soon.”
— Francisco Serrano, a Washington, D.C., resident whose niece Maria crossed the U.S. border at San Ysidro in Southern California with her two children, age 2 and 7, as part of a caravan. A week later, a shelter called Serrano, informing him that Maria was going to separated from her children, and that she had asked for Serrano to be a sponsor. Serrano describes trying to become an approved sponsor as a process marked by complications and insufficient communication. In June, he said a social worker told him he would have to restart the sponsorship process again “because the rules changed.” Maria is on her way to Washington, D.C., but the boys are still in custody.
The 7-year-old, identified in the declaration as “M.”, “asked me why I had not picked him up yet,” Serrano wrote. “The social worker told me that [he] is depressed and asked me for words of encouragement to cheer him up.”
“The guards would wake all the girls up at 4 a.m. to count them by kicking on their mats. … G cried when she told me she kept hoping her mother would show up to take her out of that horrible place, but that never happened. … G overheard a girl asking to make a phone call to her family, but she was told they did not allow girls to make phone calls while detained. “
— Alma Poletti, an investigator for Washington’s attorney general, interviewed eight children who were separated from their families and sent to the Seattle area for care and detention. “The place was freezing …The girls placed their mats in the floor very close to one another, since there was not enough space to fit them more comfortably. Girls as young as 3 years old were detained in this place and without their mothers,” Poletti wrote. She said one girl, 14, referred to as “G,” “felt hungry most of the time she was there because the food they provided her wasn’t good in quality or quantity.” “G” couldn’t sleep through the night, Poletti added.
“The placement of children with sponsors who have not been subject to the degree of evaluation and screening required by New Jersey law in all other circumstances substantially increases the risk that such children will be abuse or neglected.”
— Christine Norbut-Beyer, the commissioner of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families, said the Office of Refugee Resettlement’s rules for taking care of children placed in foster care are less rigorous than state laws in New Jersey. “The home study requirements in ORR policy also fall short of requirements imposed by New Jersey law on all other foster care or adoptive placements in the state,” she wrote. “This is important because it shows that a child’s conditions in custody under ORR might meet federal guidelines, but don’t meet state laws.”
“ORR does not provide information to [relevant state agencies] about the specific location or placement of unaccompanied minors.
— Marcela Ruiz, the chief of the Immigration and Refugees Program Branch of the California Department of Social Services, added in her statement that “state-funded programs that serve unaccompanied minors in California rely on the State’s funding to support outreach, identification, and referral services.”
“I simply cannot believe that my government could have done this to these people.”
— Taylor Levy, the legal coordinator for the nonprofit Annunciation House, testified that he had worked with asylum seekers at the border for nine years. “I have borne witness to countless stories of rape, torture and murder. Despite all of this, I have never been as emotionally impacted by anything as intensely as I have been working with these mothers and fathers as they desperately struggle to be reunited with their minor children.”
“It is evident to [Kids in Need of Defense] that there is no consistent policy for ensuring communication among separated children and parents.”
— Jennifer Podkul, policy director for KIND, which provides legal assistance to children in immigration court.
“Prolonged stress (also known as toxic stress) can permanently disrupt the structure and function of a child’s developing brain. These changes can manifest as greater likelihood of adopting unhealthy behaviors (e.g., smoking and illicit drug use), increased risk of diseases (e.g., obesity, heart disease and cancer), depression and socioeconomic inequalities.”
— Howard Zucker, the Commissioner of the New York State Department of Health. In a separate testimony, Mitchell Katz, president and CEO of New York City’s public health care system, said that “NYC Health + Hospitals have treated several children who, based upon information provided to us in the course of taking patient histories, were separated from their families at the southwestern United States border … for such condition as asthma, strep throat, and suicidal ideation.”
“Both men visibly struggled to maintain their composure while recounting the trauma that they experienced since coming to the United States and ultimately broke down into tears. Our interpreter too broke down into tears, finding their stories too painful to bear.”
— Rep. C.A. Dutch Ruppersberger, a Democratic congressman for Maryland, visited a detention center last month in Glen Burnie, Maryland, while the Trump administration was still separating children under its “zero tolerance” policy. There, he met two men who had been separated from their children under the policy. One of the men, identified as Carlos, fled Honduras with his 7-year-old son and reached the U.S. border at El Paso, Texas. He was arrested by border agents in March. The father, who said he was fleeing gang violence, wanted to claim asylum at the port of entry. Days later, Carlos was separated from his son. “Three months passed before Carlos was able to speak to his son again,” according to Ruppersberger’s testimony.
“Carlos had the foresight to make his son memorize a relative’s phone number before they left Honduras. As a result, his son was able to contact the relative, who connected him to another family member in the United States. Carlos still did not know when he would be able to see his son again,” the congressman added.

Timmy Kinner is accused of stabbing a group of children and the adults who tried to protect them at the party at an apartment complex that is home to many refugee families.
Word of the child’s death came at Kinner’s first court appearance, where Ada County Magistrate Judge Russell Comstock told him that he was charged with first-degree murder and other felonies in connection with the Saturday night attack.
Comstock told Kinner he was “an extreme danger to the community” and ordered him held without bond.
Kinner is American, and the victims are members of refugee families from Syria, Iraq and Ethiopia. Boise Police Chief William Bones said the evidence does not suggest the attack was a hate crime.
The suspect had recently stayed at the apartment complex but was asked to leave Friday over bad behavior, Bones said.
The 30-year-old appeared in court through closed-circuit video, a common practice for first appearances in Idaho. Wearing a tattered off-white sweatshirt with his arms shackled to his waist, Kinner told the judge he didn’t understand the charges or proceedings. He also said he wanted to represent himself.
The judge ordered that he be appointed a public defender anyway.
“I can’t explain the charges any more clearly than I just did,” he told Kinner.
Three of the stabbing victims were adults, the others children: the 3-year-old girl who died, two 4-year-olds, a 6-year-old, an 8-year-old and a 12-year-old.
If convicted, Kinner could be eligible for execution under Idaho law. Ada County Prosecutor Jan Bennetts said her office has not yet decided whether to seek the death penalty, saying those “high-level decisions” are made only after all the facts are in.

Monday evening roughly 1,500 people turned out at a vigil honoring members of refugee families targeted in the stabbing.
People wept, sang and shouted their support for the refugee community, and many brought bouquets of white flowers intended to symbolize peace. By the end of the rally, hundreds of bouquets filled dozens of baskets on the steps of Boise’s City Hall.
But community leaders told the crowd that what the survivors really need is money to cover rapidly growing medical bills and space at home to try to overcome the constant sense of unease they’ve experienced since the attack. Boise Mayor Dave Bieter and others urged community members to do what they can to help.
Signs were dotted throughout the crowd, some reading “love wins” and “we are all immigrants.”
Younis Kamel, a 16-year-old who moved to Boise from Iraq, and his 23-year-old sister Zuzu Kamel held up a more poignant sign:
“I will never forget seeing my friend getting stabbed in front of me,” the sign read. Younis Kamel was at the apartment complex the night of the attack.
Another woman held a sign reading “Justice for Teeba,” with a photo of a young child in a hospital bed, a breathing tube obscuring part of his face with half a dozen other tubes and medical devices connected to his body.
Louai Nasri, who also lives in the apartment complex, held up a large poster of a young girl dressed in an ornately embroidered shirt and hat. In the photo she is standing in front of a Disney Princess-themed banner and gesturing to a pink, doll-shaped birthday cake.
The picture is of Ruya Kadir, the 3-year-old girl whose birthday party was attacked. Nasri said she was a friend of his son’s."
https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/ap-fact-check-trumps-tax-miracle-immigration-claims,refugee,2174,2018-07-02T10:10:14-04:00,"Hope Yen, Associated Press","AP fact check: Trump’s tax ‘miracle,’ immigration claims","WASHINGTON — Boasting about his tax cuts, President Donald Trump inflated his role in boosting the economy to mythical proportions, claiming full credit for U.S. growth that was already in the making and ignoring the reality of a mounting deficit. On immigration, he and administration officials repeatedly spread questionable alarms by linking weak border enforcement to pervasive crime and a “surge” in MS-13 gangs.
His statements capped a week of head-spinning assertion, fabricated history and dubious claims.
They included a contradictory tweet about his support for legislation to end family separations, a claim that Russia didn’t meddle in the 2016 election, a mangled account of Wisconsin politics and declarations of campaign promises fulfilled on an Obama-era law and veterans’ health care that don’t hold up.
A look at the claims:
TRUMP: “Six months ago, we unleashed an economic miracle by signing the biggest tax cuts and reforms …the biggest tax cuts in American history.” — remarks at tax bill event Friday.
THE FACTS: He’s exaggerating.
Rather than achieving a miracle, his tax cuts have helped stoke additional growth in an economic expansion that was already approaching its 10th year. The additional growth is largely fueled by government borrowing, as the federal deficit rises because of the tax cut. The pace of growth is expected to taper off after next year, according to the Congressional Budget Office, the Federal Reserve and outside analysts.
And while the $1.5 trillion worth of tax reductions over the next decade are substantial, they’re far from the largest in U.S. history as a share of the overall economy. The Trump tax cut ranks behind Ronald Reagan’s in the early 1980s, post-World War II tax cuts and at least several more, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, which advocates for deficit reduction.
Trump listed economic achievements that build on the progress begun under President Barack Obama. The 3.8 percent unemployment rate and the historically low level of requests for jobless aid are both the result of a steady and gradual recovery from the worst economic meltdown since 1929.
Several hundred companies responded to the tax cuts by paying workers bonuses or hiking hourly wages, but any significant income growth has yet to surface in the overall economy.
The tax cuts have added on average $17 a month to people’s incomes, according to an analysis by Ernie Tedeschi, head of fiscal policy analysis at the investment firm Evercore ISI and a former Treasury Department economist. The analysis is based off consumer spending, income and inflation data released Friday.
That $17 monthly gain is helpful, but it’s far from miraculous.
WHITE HOUSE ECONOMIC ADVISER LARRY KUDLOW: “As the economy gears up, more people working, better jobs and careers, those revenues come rolling in, and the deficit, which is one of the other criticisms, is coming down, and it’s coming down rapidly.” — interview Friday on Fox Business Network.
THE FACTS: No, the deficit is not falling.
Since the fiscal year started in October, Treasury Department reports show the federal government has recorded a $385.4 billion deficit, a 12 percent jump from the same period in the previous year.
The Congressional Budget Office was even more blunt in a long-term assessment released Tuesday.
It estimates that the national debt — the sum of yearly deficits — will be $2.2 trillion higher in 2027 than it had previously forecast, largely a consequence of Trump’s 10-year, $1.5 trillion tax cut. The size of the debt could be even higher if provisions of the tax cut that are set to expire are, instead, renewed.
TRUMP: “The Liberal Left, also known as the Democrats, want to get rid of ICE, who do a fantastic job, and want Open Borders. Crime would be rampant and uncontrollable! Make America Great Again.” — tweet Sunday.
TRUMP: “Crime, crime, crime happens automatically when you have those open borders. The Democrats want to let the country be overrun. Just take a look at what’s going on, everybody comes in including the vile gang MS-13.” — remarks Wednesday in Fargo, North Dakota.
JUSTICE DEPARTMENT: “Without this action by Congress, lawlessness at the border will continue, which will only lead to predictable results — more heroin and fentanyl pushed by Mexican cartels plaguing our communities, a surge in MS-13 gang members, and an increase in the number of human trafficking prosecutions.” — statement Wednesday arguing for legislation to address border enforcement.
THE FACTS: It’s inaccurate for Trump and his administration to assert that weak immigration enforcement is leading to “rampant” crime, including from the “vile gang MS-13.” Nor is there evidence of a “surge” in MS-13.
The group is unquestionably violent but its overall numbers are somewhat limited. The Justice Department has said there are about 10,000 MS-13 members in the U.S., the same number as more than a decade ago. MS-13 accounts for less than 1 percent of total U.S. gang membership.
Formed in Los Angeles in the 1980s by El Salvador refugees and more recently expanded in Central America, the group is indeed linked to a high number of homicides in certain parts of the U.S. Even so, an FBI report put the group well behind other gangs for crimes on the southwest border — seventh of 12 — with the Surenos, Barrio Azteca and Tango Blast ranked in the top three.
Trump suggests that weak border enforcement is contributing to crime committed by MS-13. But the gang actually has many U.S.-born members at this point — people who by virtue of U.S. citizenship can’t be denied entry based on their nationality, or deported. The government has not said recently how many members it thinks are citizens and immigrants. In notable raids on MS-13 in 2015 and 2016, most of the people caught were found to be U.S. citizens.
More broadly, Trump overgeneralizes about people who arrive illegally in the U.S. Several studies have shown that immigration does not lead to increased crime.
TRUMP: “I never pushed the Republicans in the House to vote for the Immigration Bill, either GOODLATTE 1 or 2, because it could never have gotten enough Democrats as long as there is the 60 vote threshold. I released many prior to the vote knowing we need more Republicans to win in Nov.” — tweet Saturday.
THE FACTS: Trump is contradicting himself, again, as to whether the Republican-controlled Congress should seek to pass legislation to end family separations. He tweeted just three days prior that House Republicans should approve the “STRONG BUT FAIR” bill even though Democrats wouldn’t allow it to pass the Senate.
“Passage will show that we want strong borders & security while the Dems want open borders = crime. Win!” he wrote in all caps on Wednesday.
His back and forth statements came in the aftermath of highly publicized images and cries from young immigrant children being separated from their parents at the southern border. Trump has sought to blame Democrats for failure to pass legislation, but he also previously urged Republicans to stop wasting their time on the bill until after the congressional elections in November.
The GOP-led House soundly rejected a wide-ranging immigration bill last week despite Trump’s endorsement, a vote that followed the defeat on a harder-right package that garnered more conservative support.
TRUMP: “Russia continues to say they had nothing to do with Meddling in our Election! Where is the DNC Server, and why didn’t Shady James Comey and the now disgraced FBI agents take and closely examine it? Why isn’t Hillary/Russia being looked at? So many questions, so much corruption!” — tweet Thursday.
TRUMP: “When is Bob Mueller going to list his Conflicts of Interest? Why has it taken so long? Will they be listed at the top of his $22,000,000 Report…And what about the 13 Angry Democrats, will they list their conflicts with Crooked H?” — tweet Thursday.
THE FACTS: Trump repeats Russia’s denial that it had meddled in the 2016 election, even though the U.S. intelligence community determined that Russia had indeed intervened to help Trump. Many Republicans and Democrats have said they accept the findings of that intelligence assessment, including Trump’s own Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who has warned that Russia will likely try to interfere in the 2018 midterm elections.
The Senate intelligence committee said in May it had uncovered no reason to dispute the conclusions of the intelligence assessment released in 2017. Sen. Richard Burr, R-N.C., chairman of the committee, said his staff spent 14 months “reviewing the sources, tradecraft and analytic work” conducted by the intelligence agencies in accepting its conclusion.
Trump also refers to special counsel Robert Mueller’s team as “13 angry Democrats,” but Mueller is a Republican and some others on his team owe their jobs largely to Republican presidents. Some have indeed given money to Democratic candidates over the years. But Mueller could not have barred them from serving on that basis because regulations prohibit the consideration of political affiliation for personnel actions involving career attorneys. Mueller reports to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, a Trump appointee.
TRUMP: “When we won the state of Wisconsin, it hadn’t been won by a Republican since Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1952. Did you know that? And I won Wisconsin … And Ronald Reagan, remember, Wisconsin was the state that Ronald Reagan did not win.” — remarks Thursday in Mt. Pleasant, Wisconsin.
THE FACTS: He’s wrong. Eisenhower won the Badger State, in 1952 as well as 1956, but so did Reagan in the 1980 and 1984 presidential elections. Wisconsin also helped elect Republican Richard Nixon to the White House in 1968 and 1972, and gave him its backing as well in 1960, when Democrat John F. Kennedy won the presidency.
TRUMP: “We’ve eliminated horrible policies that burdened young Americans. You were burdened by things that were really, in some cases, insurmountable, including the individual mandate in Obamacare. A disaster. That’s where you pay a lot of money for the privilege of not buying health insurance. Right? One of the worst things. It’s gone.” — remarks Wednesday to college students at the White House.
TRUMP: “Obamacare is largely gone now.” — remarks Thursday in Mt. Pleasant, Wisconsin.
THE FACTS: Trump’s suggestion that the sweeping Obama-era health law has wholly burdened young Americans is misleading.
Federal studies have found the Affordable Care Act’s popular provision requiring employers and insurers to keep young adults on parental coverage until age 26 has helped millions of young people transitioning from school to work, or trying to start a career. Previously, the age at which insurance companies often forced children from their parents’ plans was 19.
Since 2010, when the new provision went into effect, the number of those 19-25 who were uninsured fell by more than half, to 4.5 million last year.
Regarding the individual mandate, while Congress did repeal the requirement that most Americans carry insurance or risk a tax penalty, that doesn’t take effect until next year. People who go without insurance this year are still subject to fines.
Other major parts of the Obama-era overhaul remain in place, including its Medicaid expansion, protections for people with pre-existing conditions, guaranteed “essential” health benefits, and subsidized private health insurance for people with modest incomes.
TRUMP, on reducing wait times for veterans seeking medical care: “The vets would be in line for 13 days, 18 days, 3 weeks, 7 days and they’d start off and they wouldn’t be in bad shape. And sometimes it would take so long before seeing a doctor that they would be terminally ill….Why don’t they just go to a doctor — local — that’s looking for the business? …We got it done. I signed it.” — remarks at Wednesday’s rally in Fargo, North Dakota.
THE FACTS: No, fulfilling his campaign promise of reducing wait times by giving veterans access to private-sector care is not done.
Trump signed into law last month a bill that would ease restrictions on private care. But its success in significantly reducing wait times for appointments depends in large part on an overhaul of VA’s electronic medical records to allow for a seamless sharing of records with private physicians. That overhaul will take at least 10 years to be complete.
Currently, only veterans who endure waits of at least 30 days — not “13 days, 18 days, 3 weeks, 7 days” — for an appointment at a VA facility are eligible to receive care from private doctors at government expense. Under a newly expanded Choice program that will take at least a year to implement, veterans will still have to meet certain criteria before they can see a private physician.
A recent Government Accountability Report found that despite the Choice program’s guarantee of providing an appointment within 30 days, veterans waited an average of 51 to 64 days. Pressed at his confirmation hearing Wednesday, VA secretary nominee Robert Wilkie declined to commit the VA to meeting the 30-day standard. He pledged to push interim fixes and better training for VA schedulers to help speed appointments.

Crowds gathered in lower Manhattan before marching over the East River to Cadman Plaza, not far from the federal courthouse for the End Family Separation NYC Rally and March. It was one of more than 600 demonstrations taking place this weekend, from the nation’s capital to Appalachia. Thousands took to the streets to demand the end of the separation of immigrant children from their families, as well as implore voters to turn out for this year’s midterm elections.

Carolina Perez of Long Island came to the United States from Chile.
“I’m an immigrant, I know what it’s like,” Perez said. “I hope today raises awareness and hopefully changes the minds of those in power.”
Under the “zero-tolerance” policy—announced in early May by Attorney General Jeff Sessions—anyone crossing the border without a visa, including people seeking asylum, would be prosecuted with a criminal offense for illegal entry.
In the following weeks, thousands of children, dubbed “unaccompanied minors,” were taken into government custody as their parents were detained in Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facilities and, in some cases, federal prisons. More than 2,700 undocumented children have been separated from their parents since the policy was put into effect. On June 20, amid public outrage, President Trump issued an executive order to halt the separations. However, more than 2,000 children are still separated from their parents.
Saturday’s coordinated effort was the culmination of a weeks-long campaign by Families Belong Together, the organization behind the June 30th day of action, to increase public pressure against the Trump administration’s crackdown at the border.

In Washington, D.C., more than 30,000 people gathered in Lafayette Square where shouts of “Shame!” rang through the crowd, according to NBC. In Atlanta, civil rights icon Rep. John Lewis (D) of Georgia echoed the spirit of the civil rights movement: “As a nation and a people we can do better,” Lewis said. “Don’t give up. Don’t give in. Keep marching.” And, near El Paso, Texas, thousands congregated near the border. There were also marches in more conservative regions like Wyoming and Kansas, and in cities large and small.
In New York, a cacophony of honking cars, beating drums, and impassioned chants filled the air.
Starting at 10 a.m., march organizer Carlene Pinto of the nonprofit New York Immigration Coalition, which advocates for refugee rights, energized the crowd in Foley Square with call-and-response cheers like, “When any New Yorker is under attack, what do we do? Stand up, fight back!” As they crossed the bridge, protesters sought refuge from the hot sun under handmade posters and umbrellas, and tourists squeezed by amid shouts of “Abolish ICE,” and “This is what democracy looks like.”

According to Anu Joshi, director of immigration policy at the nonprofit, New York has received more than 700 immigrant children who were separated from their families. For many New Yorkers, the issue hits close to home. “They feel it very deeply and personally,” Joshi said.
Richard Singh Jr. says it took him 20 years to immigrate to Queens from Guyana. “We have to fight for what we want,” Singh said. “No matter our demographic or political affiliation, we have good qualities as immigrants and refugees. We are here to contribute to this country.”
For Marilyn Mendoza of Queens, Saturday’s march is the first step in a movement. “Protesting and marching is good, but we need people to come out and help the community,” she said. “A lot of the organizations who did this event depend on donors to fund lawyers.”
Indigo Moore, a resident of Harlem, also hoped the protest would get people to care more: “You shouldn’t put babies in what has become 21st century internment shelters.”

Saturday’s rallies are not the first to pop up against Trump’s immigration policy, but they are the largest and most organized, with support from civil and social rights groups like the American Civil Liberties Union, MoveOn.org, and the National Domestic Workers Alliance.

President Salva Kiir and rival Riek Machar agreed on the “permanent” cease-fire on Wednesday in Sudan after their first face-to-face talks in almost two years. They had faced a possible U.N. arms embargo and sanctions if fighting didn’t stop and a political deal wasn’t reached by Saturday.
Multiple attempts at peace have failed, and the latest cease-fire in December was violated within hours, to the growing frustration of the international community. Both Kiir and Machar this week ordered their supporters to observe the latest agreement as of Saturday.
The civil war that erupted between supporters of Kiir and his then-deputy Machar in late 2013, just two years after South Sudan won independence from Sudan, has killed tens of thousands and created Africa’s largest refugee crisis since the 1994 Rwandan genocide. Both sides have been accused of ethnic violence and atrocities such as gang-rapes.
Millions are near famine. The new peace deal calls for the unhindered delivery of aid in one of the world’s most dangerous countries for humanitarian workers, as well as the withdrawal of forces and the release of prisoners of war.
Wary observers inside and outside the country, including the warring sides, approached the latest cease-fire with cautious optimism at best.
A joint statement by the United States, Britain and Norway on Friday warned that effects of the halt in fighting must be seen on the ground: “It must lead to improved security for communities and an end to the horrendous abuses endured by civilians at the hands of security forces.”
And despite the cease-fire, the statement said, “we will continue to seek measures at the U.N. Security Council to return the region to peace and security, including consequences for spoilers to the peace process.”
The latest talks between South Sudan’s rivals have yet to agree on a power-sharing deal, as the government last week rejected the idea of Machar again becoming Kiir’s deputy.
A 2015 peace agreement brought back Machar as vice president but the deal collapsed in July 2016 when fresh fighting erupted in the capital, Juba, with Machar fleeing the country on foot through the bush into Congo.

Some call it an inappropriate mission.
“We shouldn’t be militarizing border enforcement,” Rep. Ro Khanna, a California Democrat, said in an interview.
Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, who has made it his top priority to improve the military’s fitness for combat, argues that the Pentagon is nonetheless obliged to provide help with border enforcement.
In recent days Mattis has accepted requests by the departments of Homeland Security and Health and Human Services to provide temporary housing on Air Force and Army bases for potentially tens of thousands of detained migrant families and unaccompanied children. This is in line with historical precedents for military assistance, Mattis argued.
“We have housed refugees, we have housed people thrown out of their homes by earthquakes and hurricanes; we do whatever is in the best interest of the country,” he recently told reporters. But he also has insisted that decisions about immigration policy and its security implications are not his to make. “I’m not going to chime in from the outside,” he said.
The Pentagon says it received a Department of Homeland Security request to house up to 12,000 detained migrant family members, starting with shelters for 2,000 people to be available within 45 days. The initial shelters are likely to be at Fort Bliss in Texas, but subsequent tent cities could be at two other bases in border states.
The Pentagon has indicated Mattis will accept these requests, but no steps have been taken yet to move migrants onto the bases.
Mattis has emphasized that members of the military will not be directly involved in detaining or securing migrants. By law, the military is barred from performing domestic law enforcement functions such as arresting people crossing the border, but it has sometimes provided support for border security, including monitoring surveillance imagery and repairing border fences.
Nonetheless, Mattis has been the target of pointed objections from senators critical of the Pentagon taking on a bigger role, including lending 21 military lawyers to the Justice Department to help prosecute immigration cases at the border.
“Clearly, the military needs more, not fewer, lawyers available for its critical military justice practice,” Sens. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, Kirsten Gillibrand, D-NY, and Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., wrote in a letter to Mattis last week. They pointed out the Pentagon already had said that military lawyers are too busy to expand the services of special victims counsel.
“Instead, we have now learned the services will be diverting these valuable resources to support a non-military mission,” the senators wrote, adding that they are “deeply troubled” by what they consider a misuse of military personnel.
The Pentagon has agreed to set up tents — which it euphemistically calls “semi-separate, soft-sided camp facilities” — at Fort Bliss, if needed, for detained migrant families starting this summer. It has also agreed to make housing available at Goodfellow Air Force Base in Texas for up to 20,000 unaccompanied minors detained for illegally crossing the southern border.
These shelter operations, which could last for months, are to be run by DHS or HHS or their contractors, not the Pentagon, but defense officials say it is possible that the Pentagon will end up erecting the shelters.
This is not unprecedented. The Pentagon temporarily housed several thousand unaccompanied detained minors in 2014 at military bases. This year’s problem has drawn wider attention and sharper criticism in part because of the administration’s now-suspended practice of separating children from parents who are detained for illegally crossing the border.
“We certainly should not be using our nation’s vital military bases for non-defense purposes,” Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, an Illinois Democrat, said earlier this month in arguing that Congress should block funding for migrant detention facilities on military bases.
Even some Republicans who support Trump’s crackdown on illegal immigration are unenthusiastic.
“I am not convinced at this point that housing them in our military installations is the best short-term answer, especially if it harms regular base operations, crowds our service members, and distracts from the mission of defense,” Rep. Jodey Arrington, a Texas Republican, said in a statement. His district includes Dyess Air Force Base, which is among bases under consideration for sheltering unaccompanied detained minors.
More broadly, Trump has urged the Pentagon to help pay for the border wall that he says is critically important to stemming the tide of illegal immigration. “Our Military is rich again,” he wrote on Twitter in late March, adding that the Pentagon should pay for the wall because it would keep “enemy combatants” out of the country."
https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/eu-leaders-hail-migrant-plan-but-100-more-go-missing-at-sea,refugee,917,2018-06-29T11:59:31-04:00,"Lorne Cook, Associated Press",EU leaders hail migrant plan but 100 more go missing at sea,"BRUSSELS — European Union leaders declared victory Friday, claiming to have set aside major differences over how best to handle migrant arrivals as they commissioned new plans to screen people in North Africa for eligibility to enter Europe.
But even as they met for a second day in Brussels, the coast guard in Libya — the main jumping off point for most migrants trying to reach Europe — said around 100 people were missing and feared dead in the Mediterranean Sea after their smugglers’ boat capsized.
Bickering over who should take responsibility for the tens of thousands rescued from the Mediterranean has undermined EU unity and threatens the future of cross-border business and travel inside Europe.
At the summit, the EU leaders agreed upon a “new approach” to managing those who are plucked from the water. They would be “disembarked” from rescue ships into EU nations that agree to share responsibility for handing migration with the EU’s main point-of-entry countries like Spain, Italy and Greece but also to centers in North Africa and possibly the Balkans.
“A complete approach was adopted,” French President Emmanuel Macron told reporters after a night of haggling to address vehement demands from Italy’s new anti-migrant populist government.
“We are protecting better. We are cooperating more. And we are reaffirming our principles. All hastily-made solutions, be they solely national ones or a betrayal of our values that consists in pushing people off to third countries, were clearly set aside,” he said.
Even new Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, whose anti-Europe government has rocked the EU’s political landscape, said: “On the whole, we can say we are satisfied.”
“Italy is no longer alone, as we requested,” he said.
Libya is one of the countries where the EU is considering setting up its “disembarkation platforms,” along with Algeria, Egypt, Morocco, Niger and Tunisia. Still, details of the plans are sketchy. The EU’s executive Commission now has the job of drafting something more concrete in coordination with the U.N.’s refugee agency and the International Organization for Migration, which would prefer to operate in European migration centers only.
The UNHCR cautiously welcomed the EU’s new plan but cautioned that it must be made clearer and said African involvement via the African Union regional bloc in the plan was “indispensable.”
Leonard Doyle, an IOM spokesman, said his agency was “very pleased at the solidarity and consensus” that emerged from the EU summit in Brussels, in particular with front-line states like Italy.
Doyle said he believed that most of the “disembarkation centers” planned by the EU would be in Europe, though he said it was up to the EU to determine which countries would host them.
UNHCR spokesman Charlie Yaxley said the refugee agency is “still awaiting the legal analysis” of the new EU migration plan but would certainly welcome greater EU collaboration on handling asylum claims.
He noted that for the fifth year in a row the “grim milestone” of 1,000 migrant deaths in the Mediterranean has been crossed already — and it’s still only in the first half of 2018.
But migrant experts and humanitarian aid groups fear the EU agreement is a political smoke screen aimed at addressing the concerns of resurgent anti-migrant parties in Europe and which will only leave vulnerable people once again at risk.
“At a time when EU leadership on global issues is needed more than ever, European heads of state and government continue to try to offload their responsibilities onto poorer countries outside the EU,” said Oxfam migration policy adviser Raphael Shilhav.
He said it looks like the EU is planning more “de facto detention centers” and warned that “this approach to migration is a recipe for failure, and directly threatens the rights of women, men and children on the move.”
Imogen Sudbery at the International Rescue Committee said the new “disembarkation platforms” raise more questions than answers.
“Would this approach be compatible with international law? Would those apprehended be transferred to the nearest safe port? Crucially, under which country’s law would claims be assessed? Who would be responsible for those whose claims are upheld? We need clarity on this,” she said.
While the EU summit left the fate of those making the dangerous water crossing in doubt, it has thrown Germany a political lifeline. The results may have saved Chancellor Angela Merkel’s government, as her coalition ally was demanding a tougher line on migrants than the more welcoming policies she has preferred so far.
On the seas, there was skepticism. The captain of a ship operated by the Spanish Proactiva humanitarian group worries that the EU-funded and trained Libyan coast guard might now be recognized as part of the Mediterranean rescue apparatus. He said having the Libyan coast guard involved simply further endangered vulnerable migrants.
“For months now, they have been presented as an official body, formal, very well trained and legal. And these are the same people who have shot at us, who have kidnapped us,” said Astral Captain Riccardo Gatti. “All of this is theater.”
Libya has emerged as a major transit point to Europe for those fleeing poverty and civil war elsewhere in Africa and the Middle East. Traffickers have exploited Libya’s chaos following the 2011 uprising that toppled and later killed longtime dictator Moammar Gadhafi.
On Friday, Libyan coast guard spokesman Ayoub Gassim told The Associated Press that 14 migrants were rescued in waters east of the capital, Tripoli.

But many of them also are leaving behind loved ones who are staying in the tiny Arab nation that has become home to the highest percentage of refugees in the world.
Mohammed Suleiman Darwish, 76, was among those who left this border town for Syria with his 9-year-old granddaughter, Israa, who has not seen her parents since 2013 and will meet younger siblings who were born at home while she sought safety in Lebanon.
Darwish and his granddaughter were among a batch of about 300 Syrians crammed into trucks, tractors and other vehicles piled with mattresses and blankets. They began crossing the border for an uncertain future.
When Syrian government forces and their allies launched a wide offensive on Syria’s Qalamoun region in 2013, young Israa was staying with her paternal grandparents, who decided to take her with them to Lebanon. Israa’s parents were in the same village of Suhul but stayed at home as Syrian troops marched in.
Now Darwish and Israa are heading back to Suhul.
But he is leaving his 63-year-old wife, Baseema, in Lebanon while he repairs their badly damaged home before she can rejoin him. She will stay in Lebanon with her other son and his family.
“I missed my parents a lot when I lived here,” said Israa, who wore blue jeans, a white-and-blue sweater and flip-flops as she sat on the ground next to her grandparents before heading to Syria. “I spoke with them regularly by telephone, but now I even forgot how they look.”
When Israa left Syria in 2013, her younger sister, Aya, was 2. Since then, two other sisters and a brother, Youssef, were born, she said.
“I want to see them today,” said the green-eyed girl who seemed excited about the trip.
Darwish’s wife said her other son has a job in Lebanon.
“I hope that the war that splits us ends, and we can all gather again in Syria,” she said as she put her 9-month-old granddaughter Fatima in her lap.

The small exodus is part of a repatriation program that the Lebanese government says is voluntary — the first batch of refugees to return to Syria from the border town of Arsal this year.
Khaled Abdul-Aziz, a Syrian who heads a committee for the returnees, said 472 Syrians were expected to make the crossing Thursday after requesting permission from the Lebanese and Syrian governments. They are part of a total of 3,194 Syrians who have registered to return, he said, adding that the rest will head back in batches in the coming weeks.
The General Security Directorate, which is in charge of foreigners in Lebanon, said in a statement later Thursday that 294 Syrians had headed back. It did not give an explanation but apparently not all those who were registered had departed.
The repatriations come amid a dispute between the government of Lebanon and the U.N.’s refugee agency, which Beirut accuses of trying to discourage refugees from going home. UNHCR rejects the charges.
Lebanon hosts around 1 million registered Syrians — roughly a quarter of Lebanon’s population — and officials have said that the country can no longer afford the strain on its fragile economy.
U.N. officials and rights groups have expressed concern over the organized repatriations, calling them premature as violence and a government crackdown continue in Syria.
Lama Fakih, deputy director of the Middle East region for Human Rights Watch, said Syrians are often driven to leave by “oppressive” living conditions in Lebanon, including a lack of housing, restrictions on their movement and inability to enroll children in school.
In Arsal, the refugees gathered in the town’s Wadi Hmeid area, where a Lebanese security officer checked their IDs against a list before allowing them to cross into Syria.
Most are farmers and their families, and some of them rode pickup trucks and tractors.
The Syrian army, backed by its allies Russia and Iran, has regained more territory from the rebels, Lebanon’s government has argued that many areas in Syria have become stable enough for refugees to return.
But the U.N. is more cautious, saying Syria is not yet safe.
Lebanon’s general security chief Abbas Ibrahim said Wednesday the UNHCR has been notified about the return of the Syrians “so they can bear their responsibility.”
But Lisa Abou Khaled, a spokeswoman for UNHCR in Beirut, said the agency is not organizing the returns. She said the agency’s representatives are only present at the border crossings to answer questions. She confirmed that authorities informed them of the repatriations.
“UNHCR, as in previous movements … will be present at the departure point to attend to any query or any needs the refugees may have as they prepare to leave to Syria,” she said.
Human Rights Watch’s Fakih said research on Syrians in Arsal revealed “oppressive conditions” that led many to return. A similar convoy left Arsal last year for areas held by insurgents in Syria. It was not immediately clear what happened to those who returned.
Arsal Mayor Basil al-Hujeiry said more than 3,000 Syrians have registered to return home from the border town. Syria has asked that the repatriations take place in phases, he added.
The U.N. refugee agency “is fully respectful of the decision of the Lebanese government and we fully respect the decision of the families to return. We don’t interfere,” said Josep Zapater, head of the UNHCR office in Lebanon’s eastern Bekaa Valley.
Some young men have said they don’t want to return to Syria for fear of being drafted into the military. Those going back Thursday said they were promised they won’t be drafted for six months after their return.
“I am really scared about being drafted to the army, but the situation in Syria now is more safe,” said Salah-Eddine Abdul-Aziz, 26, who is heading to his hometown of Fleeta with his wife and son. “All I want is to return to Syria and not leave it again. Enough of being a refugee.”

https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/under-trump-higher-immigration-bonds-mean-longer-family-separations,refugee,2247,2018-06-28T14:38:01-04:00,Daniel Bush,"Under Trump, higher immigration bonds mean longer family separations","SAN ANTONIO, Texas — Federal judges are setting unusually large bonds for detained immigrants, immigration attorneys say, including for parents who were separated from their children at the border, a shift that has delayed the parents’ release even as the Trump administration insists it is making every effort to bring families back together.
Judges in past administrations routinely set large bonds for detained immigrants, often as high as $7,500, and well in excess of the $1,500 minimum required by law. But the practice appears to have grown under President Donald Trump, as judges respond to new Department of Justice guidelines aimed at reducing legal and illegal immigration.
The change is significant because the bond process is a key, if often overlooked, part of the immigration court system. For most detained immigrants, securing a bond is their only chance to live outside of detention in the United States while the federal government determines whether to deport them or allow them to remain in the country, a procedure that can take months, or in many cases, years, to complete. As of last month, the average wait time for a pending asylum case was more than 700 days, according to a database maintained by Syracuse University.
The Obama administration directed immigration judges to use their discretion to release eligible immigrants on low-cost bonds or without any bond at all, a form of parole known as “release on recognizance.” That is no longer the case under President Donald Trump, more than a dozen immigration lawyers and legal aid groups who represent detained immigrants said in interviews for this story.
Instead, immigration court judges — as well as officials from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, who also have authority to grant bonds — are increasingly denying bond requests altogether, or setting them at amounts in excess of $10,000, making them unaffordable for many immigrant families entering the country. One immigration attorney, who asked not to be named to discuss her clients’ cases, said it was “not rare” to see bonds of $25,000 for asylum seekers.
“It’s a massive departure, in the sense of removing common sense discretion,” said Alfredo Lozano, an immigration attorney, referring to administration policymakers and immigration judges.
Erica Schommer, a law professor at St. Mary’s University in San Antonio, said there was no reliable data showing exactly how many immigrants were affected by these changes. But she and other attorneys estimated that “thousands of families have gotten higher bonds since Trump took office.”
It’s unclear how many detained parents separated from their children at the border remain in custody due to their inability to pay bond.
Numerous immigration attorneys also said the rise in unusually high bonds continued even after families were separated as a result of the “zero-tolerance” policy that took effect in May, despite public assurances from senior administration officials that the government was trying its best to reunite parents and children.
“The bond setting process with these high bonds is leading to lengthier time in detention, and lengthier periods of separation,” said Denise Gilman, the director of the Immigration Clinic at the University of Texas at Austin.
A spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security wrote in an email that there was no “significant deviation” in the bond amounts that ICE officers set today compared to those under previous presidents.
The official denied that ICE officers were setting higher bonds at the request of the Departments of Homeland Security and Justice, as part of the Trump administration’s crackdown on illegal immigration. “There has been no change to bond policy,” the official said.
The average immigration bond set by ICE in fiscal year 2016 was $9,000, the official said. But he did not provide any documentation to corroborate the figure, and the agency did not respond to a request for data on the number or average cost of bonds granted to detained immigrants who were recently separated from their children.
The Homeland Security official also referred questions to the Executive Office for Immigration Review, the office within the Department of Justice that oversees federal immigration court.

On Wednesday, a spokesperson for the Department of Justice said in an email that the Executive Office for Immigration Review does not keep data on the average bond amount for immigrants in detention, or the percentage of bond requests that are approved.
Another Justice Department spokesperson followed up Thursday to say that the office did keep some statistics on median bond amounts set by the immigration court, but that the office was not required to record the amounts in its database.
The official also pointed to an annual report on immigration cases prepared by the Executive Office for Immigration Review. The latest report showed the immigration court system completed 61,976 bond cases in fiscal year 2016, down from 78,221 in fiscal year 2012, the first year in the report.
The bond process follows a complex set of guidelines. In general, however, immigrants’ chances of obtaining a bond are based on a few key factors: how they entered the country, whether they have strong ties to family already living in the U.S., and the strength of their asylum claim.
The Immigration and Nationality Act requires the federal government to detain immigrants who enter the country legally by presenting themselves at a border checkpoint and claiming asylum, as well any immigrants who are caught illegally crossing the border. Once in custody, immigrants are interviewed by government officials to determine if they have a legitimate claim to asylum. If it’s determined that they do, they become eligible for release on bond.
ICE officers can release immigrants at any point in the process. Under Obama, the agency frequently released adult immigrants into the country without bond, as long as they did not have a serious criminal record or pose a national security threat. But immigration attorneys said that practice, often referred to by administration officials as “catch and release,” has largely ended under Trump, a change that has forced immigrants to fight their cases from detention — unless they can get out on bond.
Now, as more judges set higher bonds, immigrants are increasingly spending more time in detention, immigration lawyers said.
“We’ve consistently seen the bonds creep up and up and up over the last year and a half,” said Jodi Goodwin, an immigration attorney who runs a law practice in Harlingen, a small city on the U.S.-Mexico border in southern Texas. “From what we’ve normally seen in the past, which was an average of $3,500 to $5,000, to now $10,000.”
The Trump administration has consistently said that stricter enforcement measures are needed to curb illegal immigration.
Gilman, who represents immigrants in court, said in an interview that one of her clients, a woman named Jessica, recently received a $12,500 bond after being separated from her two sons at the border in March. The woman, whose last name Gilman asked not be revealed to protect her identity, said she had fled El Salvador to escape gang violence.
After they were detained, the woman’s children, who are four and 10 years old, were transferred to the Office of Refugee Resettlement, the agency within the Department of Health and Human Services that oversees the custody of immigrant children, and later released to relatives. But the mother is still in detention, while advocacy groups attempt to raise the bond money to get her out, Gilman said.
Unlike in the criminal justice system, where defendants can be released on bail, detained immigrants in immigration court proceedings, which are civil, must have their bonds paid in full to leave detention. Bail is not allowed, a factor that makes it even harder for immigrants like Jessica to be released from detention.
Another crucial difference of immigration court — compared to criminal cases — is that the government is not required to provide a lawyer for immigrants who cannot afford to hire an attorney or find free legal representation. As a result, just 14 percent of detained immigrants in the U.S. were represented by lawyers during their deportation proceedings from 1951 to 2013, according to a report by the American Immigration Council, published in September 2016.

A separate study by the Vera Institute of Justice found that in New York State, an immigrant’s odds of remaining legally in the country increased from 4 percent to 48 percent when they had an attorney. The findings mirrored national statistics on the benefits of legal representation in immigration court.
The dearth of legal representation could impact the next phase of the family separation crisis, which has been closely intertwined with the immigration bond process.
A federal judge Tuesday ordered the Trump administration to reunify detained parents and their children within 14 to 30 days, depending on the age of the child, and stop separating families at the border. But it’s unclear how the administration will quickly reunify adults like Jessica, who are detained by the Department of Homeland Security, with their children, who are in the custody of a separate federal agency.
Moreover, the injunction did not stop the Trump administration from prosecuting immigrants who cross into the country illegally, or block judges from setting high bonds that most immigrants can’t afford to pay. As long as judges keep setting higher bond amounts, detained immigrant adults will likely continue to spend long periods of time apart from their families.
“The Department of Homeland Security and the Justice Department have been making claims about how hard they’re working to reunite families, when actually they’re working hard to keep families detained through the bond process,” Gilman said.
Immigration attorneys and legal aid groups said the administration’s claim that nothing has changed contradicts what they’re seeing on the ground in immigration courtrooms across the country.
The practice of consistently setting large bonds represents “a dramatic change from the Obama administration’s policies,” said John Sandweg, who served as the acting director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
“I’m not surprised if the Department of Justice is directing courts to step up and be tougher on bonds. The administration is trying to keep as many people in detention as possible” to hasten their deportation, Sandweg said.
In one case that is becoming increasingly common, a judge recently set a $9,000 bond for an immigrant mother after she was detained and separated from her two-year-old child at the Texas border. Schommer, the St. Mary’s law professor who is representing the woman in court, shared some aspects of her client’s story on the condition that the woman remain anonymous.
The woman based her asylum claim on being a victim of domestic abuse in her home country, Schommer said. At her bond hearing, according to Schommer, the immigration judge said he was setting a high bond because he did not think the woman’s asylum request would be granted under a ruling issued this month by Attorney General Jeff Sessions. The ruling held that gang violence and domestic abuse are no longer grounds for seeking asylum.
Schommer’s client’s case offers a concrete example of an immigration judge making decisions based on the immigration policies set by top administration officials in Washington.
“Obviously, her family does not have the $9,000” to pay for the bond, Schommer said. She said she had turned for help to RAICES, an immigration advocacy group that is raising money to pay for bonds for immigrant parents separated from their children. “We’re in the process of trying to get the money,” Schommer said. “Hopefully we’ll able to get her bond posted this week.”
That might not be necessary if the Trump administration moves quickly to comply with the order to reunify separated families. Even so, the woman will likely remain separated from her young son for at least the next several days, if not longer.
The PBS NewsHour could not independently confirm the story and other similar stories that immigration attorneys related in interviews. Immigrants who are currently in detention or who have family members in the system are often reluctant to reveal details of their cases to the media, out of fear that the information, once it is made public, could hurt their chances of avoiding deportation.
But in repeated visits to three different immigration courts in Texas this week, including one inside the detention center in the city of Pearsall, this reporter witnessed judges consistently deny bonds or set bonds at amounts well above the $1,500 minimum. In several instances, judges set bonds above $10,000, including one for $12,000 and another for $15,000.
Those bond hearings were for immigrants who were detained before the “zero-tolerance” policy took effect. Still, they provided clear anecdotal evidence of the preference on the part of judges for issuing large bonds, and the difficulties immigrants face in navigating the U.S. legal system — especially if they don’t have an attorney. The vast majority of immigrants in the bond hearings witnessed during these visits to the courts did not have legal representation.
“You can see the tide has changed. Not just with enforcement. The tide has changed with the judges’ discretion on bonds ever since Trump came to office,” said Lozano, an immigration attorney. “If they can make it difficult, they will make it more difficult.”"

Requiring unaccompanied minors to go through deportation alone is not a new practice. But in the wake of the Trump administration’s controversial family separation policy, more young children — including toddlers — are being affected than in the past.
The 2,000-plus children will likely need to deal with court proceedings even as they grapple with the ongoing trauma of being taken from their parents.
“We were representing a 3-year-old in court recently who had been separated from the parents. And the child — in the middle of the hearing — started climbing up on the table,” said Lindsay Toczylowski, executive director of Immigrant Defenders Law Center in Los Angeles. “It really highlighted the absurdity of what we’re doing with these kids.”
The U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, which oversees the deportations of unauthorized immigrants, did not respond to a request for comment.
Toczylowski said parents typically have been tried along with young children and have explained the often-violent circumstances that led them to seek asylum in the U.S.
The children being detained under the new “zero tolerance” policy, though, are facing immigration proceedings without mom or dad by their side.

“The parent might be the only one who knows why they fled from the home country, and the child is in a disadvantageous position to defend themselves,” Toczylowski said.
Meanwhile, the broader legal situation is in flux. A federal judge Tuesday night commanded the White House to reunify families within 14 days if the child is under 5 and 30 days if the child is older. The Justice Department has not indicated whether it will appeal. Attorneys who are involved in the cases said it’s unclear how the judge’s order will work in practice, and when and how it could take effect.
“We don’t know how the judge’s order is going to play out with reunification of children. What if parents have already been deported?” said Cynthia Milian, a Texas-based attorney at the Powers Law Group.
In the interim, she added, the implications for kids remain an urgent concern.
Given the trauma the children faced in their home country that spurred their families to flee and the pain of being separated from a parent, the expectation that children can mount a legal defense is “unconscionable,” said Dr. Benard Dreyer, director of the division of developmental-behavioral pediatrics at New York University School of Medicine.
“It’s certainly grossly inappropriate,” said Dreyer, who is a member of the American Academy of Pediatrics advocacy committee. “I’m ashamed that we’re doing this.”
Leaders at three legal services organizations and a private firm confirmed that the children are being served with notices to appear in court. They are not entitled to an attorney but rather are given a list of legal services organizations that might help them.
Steve Lee, a UCLA child psychology professor, said expecting the children to advocate for themselves in court is an “incredibly misaligned expectation.”
“That couldn’t be any less developmentally appropriate,” he said, adding that some children may not be mature enough to verbalize a response.

More than 2,000 children who were separated from their parents at the border have been dispatched to the far corners of the nation to care facilities and foster homes.
Officials with the Department of Health and Human Services emphasized Tuesday that the agency is working to unify children with either a parent or a sponsor. But it did not provide a timeline for how long that would take.
“We are working across agencies for reunification of each child with [a] parent or family as soon as that is practical,” Jonathan White, HHS’ assistant secretary for preparedness and response, said in a media call.
HHS representatives said children in facilities run by the Office of Refugee Resettlement receive adequate care, including medical and mental health services, and at least two phone calls per week with family.
Yet children who are just arriving at care facilities are still not connected with their families, said Megan McKenna, a spokeswoman for Kids in Need of Defense. She said the children arrive at care facilities without a parent’s tracking number, and parents don’t tend to have their kids’ numbers.
After kids arrive in care facilities, HHS officials work on finding a “sponsor” to care for the child, such as a parent, guardian, family member or family friend. Historically, unaccompanied minors — who tended to be teens — found a sponsor in about a month and a half.
However, Rachel Prandini, a staff attorney with the Immigrant Legal Resource Center, said finding a sponsor is more difficult now given recent fears that stepping forward to accept a child could trigger a sponsor’s deportation.
In April, HHS entered into an agreement with law enforcement officials that requires sponsors and adult family members to submit fingerprints and be subject to a thorough immigration and criminal background check.

HHS officials said the process is meant to protect the child.
Immigration lawyers from around the country have been flying into Texas to help represent children and families, said George Tzamaras, a spokesman for the American Immigration Lawyers Association.
It’s impossible to know how many children have begun deportation proceedings, Tzamaras said. “There have been reports of kids younger than 3 years old and others as old as 17.”
Ashley Tabaddor, president of the National Association of Immigration Judges and a jurist in Los Angeles, said that unaccompanied minor cases are heard on a special docket there. She said the judges who take the cases were trained during the last administration on children’s developmental stages, impulse control and making sure the proceedings are understandable to children.
She said in a statement that the court’s work is vital: “This is not traffic court. A mistake on an asylum case can result in jail, torture or a death sentence,” Tabaddor said. “We are a nation of laws. We value fairness, justice and transparency.”
She said children seeking asylum tend to make their case in a non-adversarial office setting with a hearing officer.
But that isn’t always the case, Prandini said. Lawyers might choose a strategy that requires more time in the courtroom.

“It’s difficult for adults at times. They go to court and they get nervous before a judge,” Milian said. “Now can you imagine a child having to go before a judge and just explain to them why they’re having to flee their country?”
Toczylowski said her organization is trying to help reunify the families so the children can be tried alongside the parents.
“The kids don’t understand the intricacies that are involved with deportation and immigration court,” she said. “They do understand that they have been separated from their parents, and the primary goal is to get back with people they love.”"
https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/how-family-separation-strains-employees-at-a-texas-child-detention-center,refugee,1973,2018-06-28T06:59:27-04:00,"Kavitha Surana, ProPublica",How family separation strains employees at a Texas child detention center,"BROWNSVILLE, Texas — The employees were in the ninth hour of another 12-hour shift Saturday afternoon at a converted Walmart now housing immigrant boys when a teenage resident took off.
Staff members at the Casa Padre shelter had been trying for weeks to connect the 15-year-old with family. It didn’t seem to be going anywhere. As a soccer game began, staffers watched as the boy dashed from the dirt field, clambered over the chain-link fence, jumped into a lake next to the building, then disappeared from view.
He wasn’t the first child to run away from a facility operated by the Southwest Key network, the largest licensed shelter provider for immigrant children caught crossing the border. Staff members went looking for him to try to convince him to stay, then stopped, accepting his departure with equal measures of exhaustion and futility.
“The staff came in at 6 a.m. This happened at 3, 3:30,” said one employee at the shelter. “People are just too tired. They don’t have the strength. … Some of them are just like, ‘You know what? Just go.’”
ProPublica spent the past several days interviewing seven current and former employees from Southwest Key facilities in Texas and Arizona who spoke on the condition of anonymity. “We have too many kids and not enough staff,” one employee said.
Their observations, coupled with court, police and regulatory records, provide a window into what it’s like to work in a system pushed into overdrive, straining to serve an increasing number of traumatized kids amid the uncertainty of America’s immigration system.
“The influx of immigrant children has stressed the entire system,” said Southwest Key spokesman Jeff Eller. “We are no different.”
Southwest Key is equipped to care for 5,427 kids across 26 facilities in Texas, California and Arizona. Ninety percent crossed the border alone. On average, kids spend 52 days in Southwest Key shelters, then go home with friends or relatives who serve as their sponsors as they wait to make their asylum cases. Those who don’t have someone here, or have sponsors afraid of submitting to a background check, can stay much longer.
The children who have been separated from a parent under the Trump administration’s zero tolerance immigration policy face even more challenges, as caseworkers struggle to locate parents in Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody, some of whom have already been swiftly returned to their countries. It’s unclear how long those kids could stay at the shelters.
“If you are stuck there a long time, it will change you,” one employee said. “In a matter of time, this kid is going to become more aggressive. He is just there like a little animal being caged.”
Some punch walls, or other kids, or staff, according to employees and records. Some cut themselves or attempt suicide. After ending up in the hospital multiple times, one boy wrote a staff member to apologize: “You told me many times not to hurt myself but I continued to do it and now I am here.”
Some take off running. One employee remembered a kid leaving during shift change, when supervision was scant; another recalled a runaway layering on three outfits at once for the journey. Sometimes, cops find the kids. Sometimes, they don’t.
Since October, 42 children have run away from the nonprofit’s shelters. Eller says Southwest Key considers these kids to have voluntarily left. “As a licensed child care center, if a child attempts to leave any of our facilities, we cannot restrain them,” he said. “We are not a detention center.”
Though dozens of federal contractors house immigrant youth, Southwest Key, founded in 1987, leads the pack, receiving more than $950 million in federal contracts since 2015 for the shelters and other services. Along with housing immigrant children, the organization operates youth justice programs, charter schools and a series of business ventures that have their profits routed back into Southwest Key. A spokesperson said 85 percent of funds paid to Southwest Key by the Office of Refugee Resettlement, an arm of the federal government established to support refugees and asylum-seekers, are directed to the costs of shelter, food, clothing, water, electricity, and shoes.
The organization has long been hailed by immigration advocates as a humane, culturally sensitive alternative to for-profit and government-run facilities. Staffers are expected to speak Spanish and taught to think of the residents as “clients.” Kids spend their days taking classes, playing basketball, watching movies and weaving brightly colored keychains. Basic medical help, education and counseling are all provided onsite.
The American Civil Liberties Union represented Southwest Key in a 2015 lawsuit against Escondido, California, alleging the city was unfairly blocking the organization from opening a new children’s shelter there. And UnidosUS, formerly known as the National Council of La Raza, one of the leading Latino advocacy organizations in the country, has for years provided Southwest Key with grants.
Clarissa Martínez de Castro, a deputy vice president with UnidosUS, said the organization continues to support the nonprofit. The Trump administration, not Southwest Key, is responsible for separating children from their parents, she said. “If the government is going to do this, these children need folks who are going to provide them the best care possible.”
Recent media scrutiny, including ProPublica’s interviews and reviews of records, has not unearthed the kinds of egregious abuse or neglect at Southwest Key facilities that plagues more troubled institutions like some foster homes or other immigrant youth shelters.
Still, police show up to Southwest Key facilities with some regularity to respond to reports of runaways and suicide attempts. They arrive in the aftermath of fights between residents, or after a staff member has been hit while trying to subdue an angry kid. The police reports, which ProPublica obtained for four Southwest Key facilities in Brownsville, give a limited picture of complaints, since a public records law keeps private reports about juvenile defendants or victims who are 16 or younger.
Former residents have said they were well treated — in sharp contrast to descriptions of their experiences at U.S. Border Patrol facilities when they first arrived.
Instead, concerns about Southwest Key center on its staffing practices.
Arizona regulatory records reviewed by ProPublica show that state inspectors found fault with Southwest Key’s backgrounding process. In October, the nonprofit was fined for a number of shortcomings, including failing to provide records proving that some employees had been fingerprinted and allowing an employee to work 113 days without applying for a fingerprint clearance card.
Texas Monthly reported that last year, Southwest Key’s Casa Padre shelter in Brownsville employed a case manager who had previously been arrested on charges of child pornography possession. When the nonprofit’s supervisors discovered his arrest record, the case manager was suspended and ultimately let go – but not until he had been allowed direct access to unaccompanied minors. A Southwest Key spokeswoman said the company’s background check did not catch his arrest because it did not result in a conviction, but the organization acted as soon as it became aware of the allegations.
The hard-to-predict ebbs and flows of immigrants coming across the border make properly staffing Southwest Key’s facilities a challenge. Last spring, after the number of unaccompanied children entering the country dropped, the nonprofit was instructed by federal authorities that they would need half as many beds. Southwest Key laid off almost 1,000 employees.
But by December, the organization was again looking to staff up. “Do you want to make a difference in the lives of youth?” read one ad.
To get a job as a youth care worker, responsible for handling intake of new children, supervising them and assisting with educational events, one former Arizona employee said, “You could say, ‘Oh I babysit my sister’ and they’d hire you.’”
Another former staffer in Arizona said she had no teaching experience when Southwest Key hired her as a teacher. “I was very surprised they hired me, honestly. I was very surprised,” she said. “I went to a job fair and as soon as I got to the interview, they offered me the position.”
Southwest Key’s spokesman said the nonprofit has “rigorous hiring standards” and that “no employee is officially hired until they have completed the entire onboarding process which includes background clearances.” He said staffers undergo a minimum of 80 hours of classroom and on-the-job training before they can supervise a child, with an additional 40 hours of required training each year.
But those interviewed by ProPublica said crisis training was limited to one day, and wasn’t enough to help them navigate the sorts of situations they routinely encounter. “If I was put in a place to do (crisis intervention), I don’t think I would have been able to,” said a former Arizona staffer. Another employee in Texas said colleagues avoid intervening if a teen is acting out because they feel unprepared. “I don’t think we got a proper training,” the employee said. “Not for what you are about to go into.”
Staffers say they wear multiple hats to fill gaps in coverage. A youth care worker might be switched to security duty; a teacher might be called upon to restrain a teen on the way to the hospital. A janitor doubles as a driver.
Almost universally, employees complained of being worked to the bone. A current employee in Texas said that as new children started being bused in daily, management cancelled vacations and placed staffers on 12-hour shifts. Bathroom breaks are a challenge. Employees regularly wait hours after requesting to relieve themselves. One said a colleague got a urinary tract infection because she was forced to wait. Another recalled running into a colleague, who was distraught because she was on her period but had yet to be relieved from her post four hours after requesting a bathroom break.
Employees have been abruptly quitting.
“Staffers are working really hard right now, and we always ensure that our programs are staffed at ratio to provide care for the children in our shelters,” said Eller, the Southwest Key spokesman. “Our employees are working overtime, but they understand the need and are earning generous overtime pay. We’re also working to staff up as quickly as possible.”
The strain manifests itself in other ways. An employee at a Texas facility said the roof has been leaking and toilets are chronically clogged. Employees in Texas and Arizona said kids are sometimes left in dirty clothes. One employee, from Arizona, recalled noticing that the shoes given to a 5-year-old boy from Guatemala were way too big, but weeks passed and no one would replace them. “I’d watch him run, ‘He’s going to fall, he’s going to face plant any day now,’” she said.
Frustration boiled over when Juan Sanchez, Southwest Key’s president and founder, who was reported receiving almost $1.5 million in total compensation in 2016, recently solicited employees for donations to help the kids, money the nonprofit said goes to scholarships. Southwest Key says it has a voluntary “employee give-back program” that employees can opt into or out of at any time.
A current staffer said Sanchez congratulated the staff for their hard work – then asked for a $10 weekly donation from their paychecks.
“He made it sound like, ‘Guys, I don’t have the money, otherwise I would pay it out of my own pocket,’” the staffer said. “Man, you have millions.”
Those who stay say they do so to hold onto above-minimum-wage jobs — tough to find in Brownsville, which has an unemployment rate almost twice that of the nation — and concern for children who are alone, coping with hardship and uncertainty.
“Yes, it’s a lot of stress, but you do something,” said one employee. “You feel that you actually got to accomplish something…
“And the kids will actually ask you, are you going to come tomorrow?”

In Europe, where far-right parties have joined the governments in Italy and Austria and made gains elsewhere, even the most basic decision of which port would accept a ship filled with migrants has been fraught.
On Tuesday, yet another rescue boat loaded with migrants struggled to find safe harbor in the Mediterranean, while in Austria police cadets playing the role of desperate refugees rattled a chain-link fence demanding to be let in as part of a high-profile training exercise to test the mettle of a new border force charged with preventing an influx of migrants.
“We have had migratory crises in the past, but that is not what we are going through now. What we are living through now is a European political crisis,” French President Emmanuel Macron said after a daylong meeting with Pope Francis at the Vatican during which they discussed the issue.
The European crisis mirrors the one in the United States, where a broad-ranging Republican immigration bill was set for a vote Wednesday, with little certainty that it would survive. With legislation in disarray and a global uproar over the separation of more than 2,300 migrant children from their parents, the Trump administration abruptly reversed a key element of its zero-tolerance immigration policy last week, halting the practice of separating immigrant families caught illegally crossing the border, but leaving more than 2,000 separated children in limbo in government-contracted shelters.
The standoffs in Europe involve multiple governments, all running their own immigration policies but with open borders among them.

Twice this month, as calm seas and warm weather spurred greater numbers to set sail, rescue ships filled with migrants have been left in a holding pattern in the Mediterranean. The latest standoff involves the German-operated Lifeline, which has sailed for five days without safe harbor. France, Portugal, Italy and at least one other country agreed to divide up the migrants on board, and said Malta would take in the ship.
But the German aid group operating the ship said Malta had sent a message refusing entry into its territorial waters, further confusing an agreement that had taken days to negotiate.
Malta also flatly refused to accept an empty rescue ship, the Aquarius, which needed some mechanical work before it could resume its sweeps of the Mediterranean. The ship headed to the French port city of Marseille instead.
It was the Aquarius that touched off last week’s showdown, when the ship, operated by French aid groups and carrying 630 migrants, had its journey to land extended by a week after Malta and Italy refused docking rights. Spain ultimately accepted the passengers, and the Aquarius traveled an additional 1,500 kilometers (900 miles) to get there.
“It’s five useless days to come here when the Aquarius is not on the migrant route to rescue, and that’s a shame in terms of saving human lives,” Frederic Penard of SOS Mediterranee said in Marseille, where the ship was expected on Friday. Italy, which believes the rescue ships operated by aid groups only encourage more migrants, also refused docking in Sicily.
Italy’s new right-wing interior minister, Matteo Salvini, has contended that the rescue boats essentially provide “taxi service” at sea for the human traffickers.
But with calm seas and fair weather, more migrants continued to take their chances crossing from North Africa.
Spain’s Maritime Rescue Service picked up over 400 people from the Mediterranean on Monday, bringing the total number of rescued migrants to around 1,800 in just four days.
Macron has pushed for asylum demands to be processed in North Africa before the rickety boats attempt the crossing, but so far no country in the region has agreed to play host.
Algeria has expelled more than 13,000 migrants into the Sahara Desert since last May, forcing them to walk without food or water, according to an Associated Press investigation. And in Libya, which has turned back dozens of migrant boats, there have been complaints of rampant human rights abuses against migrants in detention.
On Tuesday, Austrian police staged a high-profile training exercise simulating an influx of migrants along its frontier with Slovenia to demonstrate how it would deal with such a crisis.
Hundreds of officers in heavy armor, backed by soldiers and Black Hawk helicopters flying overheard, performed a dry run for the media near Spielfeld, 175 kilometers (110 miles) south of Vienna. The town was a major crossing point for migrants in late 2015, but has hardly seen any arrivals recently.
The “migrants” were played by 200 Austrian police cadets, who chanted and rattled a metal fence, demanding to be let in.
Austria’s top security official said the exercise was necessary and lawful, dismissing concerns at home and abroad.
“A state which, if things come to a head, can’t protect its borders effectively, loses its credibility,” Interior Minister Herbert Kickl told reporters. “I’m strongly determined that events like those in 2015 must never happen again.”
“This has nothing to do with inhumanity, this isn’t unlawful, this isn’t indecent,” he said. “This is what the law demands from us. It is what the people expect from us.”
Kickl’s far-right Freedom Party has pushed for a hard line against migrants for years and saw a surge in support following the 2015 migrant crisis, when thousands of people fleeing war and hardship in the Middle East and Africa poured through Europe’s open borders daily, triggering a humanitarian and political crisis that has left deep divisions on the continent.

This summer’s numbers come nowhere near the 2015-2016 migrant crisis, but German Chancellor Angela Merkel is under heavy pressure from conservative allies in Bavaria to turn away migrants who come through other European countries.
Merkel, whose decision to allow migrants stuck in Austria and Hungary to come to Germany was initially welcomed by voters, has warned that unilaterally closing borders could trigger a string of national measures by individual countries that would further divide Europe.
Speaking in Berlin, Merkel said most EU countries are more concerned about preventing migrants from illegally entering Europe in the first place.
Neighboring Slovenia protested the Austrian exercise, saying its own forces are already doing enough to protect the borders of the Schengen travel zone within which Europeans can travel freely without passports.
“I even see (the exercise) as somewhat provocative,” Slovenian Prime Minister Miro Cerar said Tuesday, according to the official STA news agency. Cerar said the number of migrants entering Austria from Slovenia has not increased and described his country as an “exemplary” protector of the Schengen border.
Meanwhile, Martin Sellner, who heads Austria’s white nationalist Identitarian Movement, applauded the fact that authorities were using the same “#proborders” hashtag favored by his group to inform the public about the exercise.
Macron said that these were the battle lines being drawn in Europe, with migration at the center.
“We are not good at this subject, either in Europe or in France,” he said. “But we have a society to lead.”

https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/prince-william-kicks-off-busy-day-in-israel-at-yad-vashem,refugee,789,2018-06-26T07:04:48-04:00,"Aron Heller, Associated Press",Prince William visits Israel’s Holocaust memorial,"JERUSALEM — Prince William began his visit to Israel on Tuesday with an emotional visit to Jerusalem’s Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial and a meeting with two survivors who escaped Nazi Germany for the safety of Britain.
Yad Vashem Chairman Avner Shalev, who guided the Duke of Cambridge through the museum’s exhibitions detailing Nazi Germany’s genocide of 6 million Jews during World War II, said the prince was visibly moved as he stopped to inquire about various elements of the Holocaust.
“The theme that repeated itself throughout the entire visit was his wondering of what kind of deep hatred could have driven people to commit such horrific acts,” Shalev told The Associated Press. “He kept saying: ‘How did they get to such a place?’ … He really identified with the victims.”
The hour-and-a-half visit included a ceremony in which he placed a wreath on a concrete slab containing the ashes of Holocaust victims and a brief meeting with a pair of survivors from the Kindertransport, a rescue effort for some 12,000 children who were sent from Germany to Britain on the eve of World War II.
Henry Foner, who was fostered by a Jewish family in Swansea, Wales, and later served overseas for the British Army, said it was like a fairy tale for a refugee child like himself to meet a member of the royal family eight decades after the country rescued him.
“I’m very grateful to Britain because it saved my life, it’s as simple as that,” said Foner, 86. “It was as if he knew us, he knew the background and he made us feel so at home. It’s as if you had met a friend you hadn’t seen in a while.”
In signing the Yad Vashem guestbook, the prince called it a “profoundly moving experience” and said the Holocaust was “almost impossible to comprehend.”
He noted with pride that his great-grandmother had been recognized as a Righteous Among the Nations, the highest honor Israel grants to non-Jews who risked their lives to save Jews during the Holocaust. Princess Alice hid three members of the Cohen family in her palace in Athens during the Nazi occupation of Greece in World War II. Thanks to her efforts, the Cohen family survived and today lives in France.
The princess died in 1969, and in 1988 her remains were brought to Jerusalem. Prince William plans to visit her gravesite later in the week as part of his tour of Jerusalem landmarks.
The prince is the first member of the British royal family to pay an official visit to Israel. Though the trip is being billed as non-political, the prince is meeting with Israeli and Palestinian leaders and visiting sites at the heart of the century-old conflict.
Three decades of British rule between the two world wars helped establish some of the fault lines of today’s Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and Britain’s withdrawal in 1948 led to the eventual establishment of Israel and Jordan, where he kicked off the five-day Mideast tour on Sunday.
For the 36-year-old William, second in line to the throne, it marks a high-profile visit that could burnish his international credentials.
After Yad Vashem he met with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his wife Sara, accompanied by descendants of the Cohen family Princess Alice had saved.
Later, President Reuven Rivlin told the prince about his childhood in Jerusalem living under the British mandate and asked him to deliver a “message of peace” to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, whom he will meet later in the week.
The Palestinians are also eager to welcome the prince, hoping his visit will give them a boost as they struggle with a Trump administration they consider biased toward Israel.
The prince will try to deftly dodge politics as he later visits east Jerusalem, which Israel captured in the 1967 Mideast war and annexed in a move not internationally recognized. Israel considers east Jerusalem, home to holy sites sacred to Jews, Christians and Muslims, as an inseparable part of its capital. The Palestinians claim east Jerusalem as their future capital.
The prince presented Rivlin, an avid football fan, with a jersey of his favorite Premier League team, Liverpool, and expressed how eager he was to dive into his first visit to the Holy Land.
“I’m really looking forward to getting to meet as many Israelis as possible and understand Israeli history and Israeli culture,” the prince said. “I’m very much looking forward to really absorbing and understanding the different issues.”
William then departed for coastal Tel Aviv to attend a football game of young Jewish and Arab players. He was also to meet the mayor of Tel Aviv and attend a reception held by the British ambassador that will include demonstrations by Israeli tech startups."
https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/sessions-defends-trump-administrations-immigration-policies,refugee,894,2018-06-25T16:04:10-04:00,"Scott Sonner, Associated Press",Sessions defends Trump administration’s immigration policies,"RENO, Nevada — While hundreds of protesters rallied outside, Attorney General Jeff Sessions defended the Trump administration’s immigration policies Monday in a speech, calling on Congress to act and asserting that many children were brought to the border by violent gang members.
Speaking at a school-safety conference in Nevada, Sessions said the crisis at the border is a “difficult and frustrating situation” that requires Congress to act.
“Children have indeed borne much of the burden of our broken immigration system,” he told the National Association of School Resource Officers in Reno.
The compassionate thing to do, he said, is to protect children from violence and drugs, put criminals in jail and secure borders. He called the alternative, having open borders, “both radical and dangerous.”
Outside the hotel-casino where he spoke, more than 200 protesters opposed to the administration’s immigration policies blocked a busy road. The demonstrators — a coalition of civil rights, religious and union activists — carried signs and drums and were joined by a mariachi band. Some sat in a busy roadway for while police diverted traffic around them.
The protesters chanted, “Jeff Sessions, you can’t hide. Reno sees your ugly side!” Several carried signs that read “Children are not political” and “Impeach the mad king.”
At least a half-dozen people wearing red arm bands said they intended to get arrested.
The Rev. Karen Foster of the Unitarian Universalist Fellowship said American children are taught to pledge allegiance to the flag “with liberty and justice for all.” She said “there is no justice for thousands of children locked in cages” at the border.
No arrests were immediately reported.
Nearly two dozen Nevada groups tried unsuccessfully last week to persuade the national school law enforcement group hosting the conference to withdraw its invitation to Sessions.
Meanwhile, a congressman said he was turned away from trying to meet with detainees from the southern border crisis because of a chicken pox outbreak at a federal prison in Tacoma, Washington.
Democratic Rep. Derek Kilmer went to the Northwest Detention Center on Saturday after hearing that a number of migrants who were separated from their children had been transferred there from another federal prison in the area.
Kilmer told the Tacoma News Tribune that he had tours scheduled at both facilities, but they were canceled due to protest-related safety concerns.
When the congressman tried to visit three detainees during regularly scheduled visiting hours on Saturday, he was told that they were all quarantined due to chicken pox exposure.
On Sunday, more than 30 immigrant parents separated from their children after crossing the U.S.-Mexico border were freed into the care of a Texas charitable organization, the group said, but the parents don’t know where their kids are or when they might see them again.
The release was believed to be the first, large one of its kind since Trump signed an executive order that preserved a “zero-tolerance” policy for entering the country illegally but ended the practice of separating immigrant parents and children.
Ruben Garcia, director of Annunciation House in El Paso, said the group includes mothers and fathers from Mexico, Guatemala and Honduras who came to his group after authorities withdrew criminal charges for illegal entry.
Garcia would not provide names or personal details of the parents, and reporters could not speak with them. Department of Homeland Security officials said they could not check the veracity of the claims without more specific identifying information.
The exact process to reunite families has been unclear because migrants are first stopped by Customs and Border Patrol, with children taken into custody by the Department of Health and Human Services and adults detained through Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which is under the Department of Homeland Security. Children have been sent to far-flung shelters around the country, raising alarm that parents might never know where their children can be found.
Officials have said as many as 2,300 children had been separated from the time the policy began until June 9. At least 2,053 minors who were separated at the border were being cared for in HHS-funded facilities, the fact sheet said.
As part of the effort, ICE officials have posted notices in all its facilities advising detained parents who are trying to find or communicate with their children to call a hotline.
A parent or guardian trying to determine if a child is in the custody of HHS should contact the Office of Refugee Resettlement National Call Center at 1-800-203-7001, or via email at information@ORRNCC.com. Information will be collected and sent to an HHS-funded facility where a minor is located.
But it’s unclear whether detained parents have access to computers to send an email, or how their phone systems work to call out. Attorneys at the border have said they have been frantically trying to locate information about the children on behalf of their clients.
The administration’s “zero-tolerance policy” of criminally prosecuting anyone caught illegally crossing the border remains in effect, officials have said, despite confusion on the ground on how to carry out Trump’s order.
Justice Department officials asked a federal judge to amend a class-action settlement that governs how children are treated in immigration custody. Right now, children can only be detained with their families for 20 days. Trump officials are seeking to detain them together indefinitely as their cases progress. Advocates say family detention does not solve the problem."

He’s also suggesting that a newly signed executive order would solve the problem of family separations at the border, even while continuing to blame Democrats for separations that result from his own policy of criminally prosecuting every adult entering the U.S. illegally.
His comments capped a dizzying week of questionable claims, non-sequiturs and outright misstatements amid fallout over his treatment of refugees crossing the U.S.-Mexico border.

Meanwhile, on North Korea, Trump contradicted his own Defense Department by saying that leader Kim Jong Un had already begun to fully rid the country of nuclear weapons and wavered back and forth on statements regarding the level of threat the North posed to the U.S.
He also left out important context about the creation of new U.S. jobs and rising wages, overstated the impact of a new health insurance option for small businesses that appeared aimed at undercutting an Obama-era law, and repeated misleading claims about a special counsel’s probe into Russian meddling in the 2016 election.
A look at the statements:
TRUMP: “They can be killers, they can be thieves, they can be horrible people.” — weekly address Saturday.
TRUMP: Democrats “think immigration is being weak on the border, which is therefore allowing tremendous crime to come into our country.” — remarks Saturday to Nevada GOP convention.
TRUMP: “I always hear that, ‘Oh, no, the population’s safer than the people that live in the country.’ You’ve heard that, fellas, right? You’ve heard that. I hear it so much, and I say, ‘Is that possible?’ The answer is it’s not true. You hear it’s like they’re better people than what we have, than our citizens. It’s not true.” — remarks Friday.
THE FACTS: His generalization about people in the U.S. illegally is overdrawn, dismissing without evidence several studies showing immigration does not lead to increased crime.
The studies from social scientists and the libertarian think tank Cato Institute have shown that people here illegally are less likely to commit crime than U.S. citizens, and legal immigrants are even less likely to do so.
A March study by the journal Criminology found “undocumented immigration does not increase violence.” The study, which looked at the years 1990 through 2014, argues that states with bigger shares of such people have lower crime rates.
A study last year by Robert Adelman, a sociology professor at University of Buffalo, analyzed 40 years of crime data in 200 metropolitan areas and found that immigrants helped lower crime. New York City, for example, has the nation’s largest population of immigrants living in the country illegally — about 500,000 — and last year had only 292 murders among a total population of 8.5 million people. A city murder rate is often used as a benchmark for overall crime because it’s difficult to fudge murder statistics.
And Ruben Rumbaut, a University of California, Irvine sociology professor, co-authored a recent study that noted crime rates fell sharply from 1990 to 2015 at a time when illegal immigration spiked.

TRUMP: “Open Borders Democrats support the loopholes that prevent families from being detained and removed together — they just want everyone to be released into our country no matter how dangerous they are.” — weekly address Saturday.
TRUMP: “Democrats, fix the laws…Strong Borders, No Crime!” — tweet Sunday.
THE FACTS: His assertion that Democrats are fully to blame for continued family separations is misplaced.
The separations are a consequence of a Trump administration policy to maximize criminal prosecutions of people caught trying to enter the U.S. illegally. That means more adults are jailed, pending trial, so their children are removed from them. Before the policy, many people who were accused of illegal entry and did not have a criminal record were merely referred for civil deportation proceedings, which generally did not break up families.
While Republicans hold a 51-49 majority in the Senate, there are enough Democrats to block legislation sought by Trump on a procedural vote that would also provide money for a border wall. House Republicans, meanwhile, are internally divided over a suitable plan.
As thousands of children were separated from their parents at the Mexican border, President Trump and his supporters doubled down, advancing his Republican approval rating to the highest in history. Many in his base came together to either deny the situation or sympathize with the claim that Trump is under attack. NewsHour Weekend Special Correspondent Jeff Greenfield joins Hari Sreenivasan.
Trump has blamed “bad legislation passed by the Democrats” for driving families apart. But the 2008 law he appears to be referring to passed unanimously in Congress and was signed by a Republican president. It was focused on freeing and otherwise helping children who come to the border without a parent or guardian. It does not call for family separation.
While blaming Democrats, Trump in the past week has also told congressional Republicans to “stop wasting their time” on immigration legislation until after November.

TRUMP on Kim Jong Un: “We get along very well…He’s a great negotiator. I think he sees a tremendous future for North Korea. But we want to have it denuclearized, and that’s what’s happening.” — remarks Saturday at roundtable on tax reform in Las Vegas.
TRUMP: “The big thing is, it will be a total denuclearization, which has already started taking place.” — remarks Thursday at Cabinet meeting.
THE FACTS: That’s not what his Pentagon chief, Jim Mattis, says. When asked by a reporter on Wednesday whether he had seen any sign that North Korea had begun steps toward denuclearization, Mattis replied, “I’m not aware of any. Obviously, we’re at the very front end of the process. Detailed negotiations have not begun.”
At a Singapore summit with Trump earlier this month, North Korea’s leader committed to “complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula,” but no details were worked out.
In May, prior to the summit, North Korea demolished tunnels at its sole underground nuclear test site, although outsiders have not inspected the result. Its nuclear program has many other elements, including nuclear materials production facilities, nuclear warheads, ballistic missiles and missile launchers.
Trump had pointed to the summit’s discussions on denuclearization in asserting that North Korea was no longer a nuclear threat, but on Friday he appeared to reverse course by declaring that the North still poses an “extraordinary threat” to the U.S. In an executive order, the president extended for one year the so-called “national emergency” with respect to the nuclear-armed nation, re-authorizing economic restrictions against it.

TRUMP: “And ultimately, we have to have a real border — not judges. Thousands and thousands of judges they want to hire. Who are these people? When we vet a single federal judge, it goes through a big process. Now we’re hiring thousands and thousands. … And it got so crazy that all of these thousands — we now have thousands of judges — border judges — thousands and thousands.” — remarks Tuesday to the National Federation of Independent Business.
TRUMP: “We shouldn’t be hiring judges by the thousands, as our ridiculous immigration laws demand.” — tweet Thursday.
THE FACTS: He’s incorrect about the U.S. having “thousands and thousands” of immigration judges and about thousands more judges being hired. The Justice Department’s immigration courts division has about 335 judges currently on staff nationwide, with the budget for 150 additional judges.
Dana Leigh Marks, past president of the National Association of Immigration Judges who also works in the Justice Department’s executive office for immigration review, said funding for immigration courts has increased modestly amid a growing backlog of cases. With a backlog of 700,000, each judge would have to take on more than 2,000 cases to clear the docket.
The figures also don’t take into account a wave of expected retirements that would shrink the ranks of judges. A June 2017 Government Accountability Office report determined that 39 percent of immigration judges are now eligible for retirement. Congressional investigators blamed the mounting caseload in part on the slow hiring of immigration judges.

TRUMP: “We’re keeping families together, and this will solve that problem.” — remarks Wednesday at signing of order to halt his administration’s policy of separating children from their parents when they are detained illegally crossing the U.S. border.
THE FACTS: It doesn’t solve the problem.
Trump’s executive order will continue his “zero tolerance policy” of criminally prosecuting all adults caught crossing the border illegally, and will now seek to keep families together in detention instead of separating them while their legal cases are heard by the courts.
But a 1997 landmark settlement known as the Flores agreement that generally bars the government from keeping children in immigration detention for more than 20 days remains in place. Trump is seeking to have the settlement amended, but his Justice Department says the 20-day policy remains in effect until Congress or the courts take action to change that.
That means without further action from Congress or the courts, the Trump administration could be forced to again separate the immigrant children from their parents in three weeks.

TRUMP: “We have created more than 3.4 million new jobs since Election Day. 3.4 million. Think of what that means.” — remarks Tuesday to the National Federation of Independent Business.
THE FACTS: Well, one thing it means is that job creation has slowed a bit compared to its previous pace. Trump is right that U.S. companies have added 3.4 million jobs in the 18 months since his election, a healthy total. But in the previous 18 months, 3.7 million jobs were added. That’s not entirely surprising or a sign of a weakening economy — job gains typically decline as the unemployment rate falls and there are fewer people to hire. The unemployment rate is currently at an 18-year low of 3.8 percent. But Trump’s remarks suggest there has been a turnaround in job creation, when there hasn’t.

TRUMP: “Wages for working people are finally, after 22 years, rising again in our country.” — remarks Tuesday.
THE FACTS: Wages, before adjusting for inflation, have ticked up in recent months. But so has inflation, which is offsetting those gains. In May, average hourly pay rose 2.7 percent from a year earlier. Yet inflation rose slightly more during that time: 2.8 percent. Household incomes rose at a solid pace in 2015 and 2016, according to the Census Bureau, partly because inflation was much lower during that time.
TRUMP, on a health insurance option for small businesses and self-employed people: “You’re going to save massive amounts of money and have much better health care. It’s going to cost you much less. It’s going to be, I think, fantastic. And it’s very comprehensive. I will tell you, a lot of people — big, big percentages of this country — are going to be doing that.” — remarks Tuesday.
THE FACTS: Trump paints an overly rosy picture. It’s not projected that “big, big percentages” of people will benefit.
The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates a more modest impact of 4 million people who will be covered by the plans within five years but only some 400,000 — just 10 percent of those — who would have been uninsured. That’s compared to about 160 million who are covered by job-based insurance.
TRUMP: “‘I can’t think of something more concerning than a law enforcement officer suggesting that their (sic) going to use their powers to affect an election!’ Inspector General Horowitz on what was going on with numerous people regarding my election. A Rigged Witch Hunt!” — tweet Tuesday.
THE FACTS: Trump’s statement is misleading. He suggests that findings of a Justice Department watchdog report by inspector general Michael Horowitz on the 2016 Hillary Clinton email investigation means that special counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia probe — which he often criticizes as a “witch hunt” — is “rigged.” The IG report determined that the FBI had made mistakes in the handling of the Clinton probe, which Horowitz described as “extremely serious.” But Horowitz dismissed the notion the probe had been rigged, saying that investigators did not uncover evidence that political bias had influenced the FBI’s conclusion that Clinton should not be prosecuted.
The IG report released earlier this month also did not address questions of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia, the subject of the investigation led by Mueller, who was appointed last year to take over the FBI’s Russia probe after Trump fired former FBI Director James Comey.

TRUMP: “We’ve eliminated record numbers of job-killing regulations … we’ve cut more regulation than any other president in the history of our country whether it’s four years, eight years or in one case 16 years, we’ve cut more regulations in 500 days than any president. Even our 16-year president.” — remarks Wednesday at Duluth, Minneosta, rally.
THE FACTS: Trump gets his history wrong, repeating a claim that a U.S. president once served 16 years. Franklin D. Roosevelt, the country’s longest-serving president, died after serving 12 years in office from 1933 to 1945.
WATCH: Why Kim leaves Singapore with real achievements
TRUMP, on the return of remains from the Korean War: “We got back our great fallen heroes, the remains sent back today, already 200 have been sent back.” — remarks Wednesday.
THE FACTS: No remains have been returned, although Pentagon officials say they are prepared to receive them. Although the Singapore declaration said this would happen immediately, U.S. officials have given no indication that North Korea has committed to any specific timetable for the return.
On Thursday, in remarks at a Cabinet meeting, Trump modified his claim, saying, “They’ve already sent back or are in the process of sending back the remains of our great heroes who died in North Korea during the war.”
Aside from uncertainty over when North Korea will return the remains it has collected over the years, it’s unclear whether all will be in a condition to permit their positive identification, or whether they all are even Americans. A number of allied soldiers who fought alongside the U.S. during the war also are missing.
Nearly 7,700 American service members are listed as unaccounted for from the Korean War, of which an estimated 5,300 were lost in North Korea.

TRUMP: “There was a story two days ago, in a major newspaper, talking about people living in Canada, coming into the United States, and smuggling things back into Canada because the tariffs are so massive. The tariffs to get common items back into Canada are so high that they have to smuggle them in. They buy shoes, then they wear them. They scuff them up. … We’re treated horribly.” —remarks Tuesday.
THE FACTS: The president appears to be referring to a column in the New York Post about Canadians who buy shoes, jeans and outdoor goods in the United States and take them into Canada without paying duties or taxes. In some cases, the items aren’t available in Canada or were more expensive.
But most items made in the United States, including shoes, can be imported into Canada duty-free under NAFTA, an agreement that Trump has strongly criticized and is renegotiating with Canada and Mexico.
For its part, the United States imposes some of its highest tariffs on shoe imports. Duties on footwear average nearly 11 percent but for some products can reach nearly 68 percent, according to the U.S. International Trade Commission.
Yet even with the higher costs imposed by tariffs, roughly 95 percent of shoes in the United States are imported from countries like China, Vietnam and Italy, the ITC says.

A fact sheet on “zero-tolerance prosecution and family reunification” released Saturday night by the Department of Homeland Security and other agencies involved in the separations also says a parent must request that their child be deported with them. In the past, the agency says, many parents elected to be deported without their children. That may be a reflection of violence or persecution they face in their home countries.
The fact sheet doesn’t state how long it might take to reunite families. The Port Isabel Service Processing Center in Texas has been set up as the staging ground for the families to be reunited prior to deportation.
The latest actions come after President Donald Trump’s order last week to stop separating migrant children from their parents. The executive order signed Wednesday immediately spread confusion along the border, with officials sending conflicting signals about the state of the administration’s “zero tolerance” policy. Some parents said they did not even know where their children were.
How the government would reunite families has been unclear because the families are first stopped by Customs and Border Patrol, with children taken into custody by the Department of Health and Human Services and adults detained through Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Children have been sent to far-flung shelters around the country, raising alarm that parents might never know where their children can be found.

As of last Wednesday, 2,053 minors who were separated at the border were being cared for in HHS-funded facilities, the fact sheet said.
Since Trump’s order, protests have erupted around the country over the separations and the future of families arriving to the U.S. illegally.
The fact sheet states that ICE has: implemented an identification mechanism to ensure on-going tracking of linked family members throughout the detention and removal process; designated detention locations for separated parents and will enhance current processes to ensure communication with children in HHS custody; worked closely with foreign consulates to ensure that travel documents are issued for both the parent and child at time of removal; and coordinated with HHS for the reuniting of the child prior to the parents’ departure from the U.S.
As part of the effort, ICE officials have posted notices in all its facilities advising detained parents who are trying to find or communicate with their children to call a hotline staffed 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. Monday through Friday.
A parent or guardian trying to determine if a child is in the custody of HHS should contact the Office of Refugee Resettlement National Call Center at 1-800-203-7001, or via email information@ORRNCC.com. Information will be collected and sent to an HHS-funded facility where a minor is located.
But it’s unclear whether detained parents have access to computers to send an email, or how their phone systems work to call out. Attorneys at the border have said they have been frantically trying to locate information about the children on behalf of their clients.

U.S. Customs and Border Patrol said it had reunited 522 children and that some were never taken into custody by Health and Human Services because their parents’ criminal cases were processed too quickly. Officials have said as many as 2,300 children had been separated from the time the policy began until June 9. It’s not clear if any of the 2,000 remaining children were taken into custody after June 9.
The “zero-tolerance policy” of criminally prosecuting anyone caught illegally crossing the border remains in effect, officials have said, despite confusion on the ground on how to carry out Trump’s order. Justice Department officials asked a federal judge to amend a class-action settlement that governs how children are treated in immigration custody. Right now, children can only be detained with their families for 20 days; Trump officials are seeking to detain them together indefinitely as their cases progress. Advocates say family detention does not solve the problem."

Facing a domestic political crisis in Germany over the topic, Chancellor Angela Merkel will be seeking to get EU leaders to forge a joint approach to manage the influx of migrants and refugees, a divisive issue which is now back at the heart of the EU too.
There are deep divisions over who should take responsibility for arriving migrants, how long they should be required to accommodate them, and what should be done to help those EU countries hardest hit like Italy and Greece.
Italy’s populist 5-Star Movement demanded Sunday that European countries step up and actually take action to deal with hundreds of thousands of migrants on the continent. The 5-Stars, who are in a ruling coalition with the anti-migrant League party, penned a blog titled “The migrant hypocrisy sinks Europe.”
“It’s time for Europe to find itself again in the principles that everyone preaches, but few sincerely practice,” the party said, adding “the future of Europe as a political community” is at stake.
Looking for common ground among a few key nations, the informal mini-summit now involves about 16 member states, as others demanded to take part.
And to further complicate matters, four eastern EU countries — the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia — refused to attend and reject taking in migrants in general. It means that whatever is agreed upon Sunday, it would still face a full test when the full two-day EU summit starts Thursday.
Two issues have brought the crisis back to haunt the leaders: In Germany, Christian Democrat coalition partners CDU and CSU are haggling over the right approach in what is seen as one of the toughest challenges Merkel has faced in her entire political career.
In Italy, the new populist government caused a fight with Malta and France over who should take responsibility for 630 people rescued from the Mediterranean Sea off the coast of Libya, the main departure point for people trying to reach Europe. Amid the mud-slinging, Spain’s new Socialist government agreed to take charge of the migrants last weekend.
On Saturday, Spain also announced it had rescued 569 more migrants at sea, many from boats in the Strait of Gibraltar, a busy shipping lane with treacherous currents.

But Italy and Malta were at it again Saturday, refusing to let a German rescue ship with 234 migrants dock. The German aid group said a cargo vessel, the Alexander Maersk, had another 113 migrants and was also waiting for a port to receive them.
One of the key accomplishments of the EU is the Schengen free travel zone and some fear that closing internal borders between EU nations to keep migrants out would undermine that cornerstone of EU cooperation.
“We want to have real controls at the external borders to make sure we can safeguard the free travel zone of Schengen,” said Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel."
https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/kirstjen-nielsen-high-school-immigrant-legal-aid,refugee,842,2018-06-23T11:05:56-04:00,Vivekae Kim,Alumni of DHS head Nielsen’s high school raise money for immigrant legal aid,"Alumni of the high school that Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen attended in Florida have raised over $12,000 for immigrants in need of free and low-cost legal aid, a rebuke to the Trump administration official presiding over the family separation crisis this week.
The effort took off on Facebook after Reuben Siegman, a graduate of Berkeley Preparatory School in Tampa, Florida, began following news reports of adult and migrant children being separated at the U.S.-Mexico border.
“I knew this was an issue that was a moral issue and that could transcend party lines,” Siegman told the NewsHour in an email.
Siegman reached out to Megan Magray, a fellow alum at the school—from which Nielsen graduated from in 1990—and the pair created a Facebook messenger group chat with other alumni who wanted to help reunite families and raise awareness about separations at the border.
The group formulated a plan to write an open letter to the school opposing family separation in an effort to join critics trying to “put as much pressure on Nielsen to overturn [the] policy,” said Paul Caintic, another alum who participated in the effort.
To many, Nielsen became the face of the family separation crisis after holding a press conference at the White House Monday where she defended the policy. Nielsen pushed back on allegations of family separation as child abuse, asserting that, “We give them meals, we give them education, we give them medical care. There’s videos, there’s TVs.” She also repeated President Donald Trump’s false claim that Congress needed to act in order to end family separation.
After that conference, alumni from Nielsen’s alma mater “realized [Secretary Nielsen] had just become the undeniable face of this policy, and we had to mobilize immediately,” Magray said in an email.

On Tuesday, the group published an open letter addressed to Berkeley Prep’s headmaster, Joseph W. Seivold, that begins with a reprise of school’s motto: “Berkeley puts people in the world who make a positive difference.” The letter says that alumni of the school would be “remiss to stay silent” as a Berkeley Prep graduate enforces a separation policy that is “undeniably cruel.” It ends with a three-pronged call to action for the Berkeley community: pledging money to RAICES Texas, giving “time to causes that advance the wellbeing of people across the world,” and calling on their “peer” Kirstjen Nielsen to either end family separations or resign.
They also began raising money for the Refugee and Immigrant Center for Education and Legal Services, or RAICES, to help the advocacy group pay for legal representation for immigrants, bond payment for family reunification, and training volunteer lawyers, among other services.
The organizers sent the open letter to members of their community with a GoFundMe link for donations to RAICES attached, asking recipients of their messages to pass it on. By the next morning, and before organizers publicized it on social media, the letter had earned 175 signatures. From there, it “grew with the power of social media,” Eli Siegman, who graduated this year, said in an email. The letter gained more than 680 signatures from alumni, students, faculty and parents by Friday, organizers said.

On Wednesday, Trump signed an executive order to end family separation, and Department of Homeland Security officials said as of Friday 500 children out of the 2,300 that were separated from their families had been reunited.
Next week, Congress plans to vote on an immigration bill that grants some young undocumented immigrants a path to citizenship, stops the process of family separation at the border and provides funding for a border wall.
The alumni activists said they would continue their work despite the administration’s reversal on family separation, citing concerns about the conditions in family detention centers, the difficulty of reunification and the need for continued legal support at the border.
“The people signing onto our letter are Republicans, Democrats, Libertarians, Socialists — they’re everyone,” Magray said.
In 2016, Hillsborough County, where Berkeley Prep is located, voted by a slim majority for Hillary Clinton. But in every county directly adjacent to Hillsborough, Trump garnered a plurality or majority of votes.
In response to the alumni action, Berkeley Prep released a statement: “As a school, Berkeley’s charge is not and cannot be to take a position on non-education-related governmental policy or action; it is to foster the confidence and build the critical thinking skills of our students so that they may do so.”
The group’s new goal is to raise $25,640, or the cost of tuition for one year at Berkeley Prep.
“We want to raise as much money as possible for the cause. We will continue to advocate for these children,” Siegman, one the alumi organizers, said."
https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/administration-seeks-to-expand-immigrant-family-detention,refugee,925,2018-06-23T10:16:30-04:00,"Amy Taxin, Associated Press",Administration seeks to expand immigrant family detention,"SANTA ANA, Calif. — The Trump administration is calling for the expanded use of family detention for immigrant parents and children who are stopped along the U.S.-Mexico border, a move decried by advocates as a cruel and ineffective attempt to deter families from coming to the United States.
Immigration authorities on Friday issued a notice that they may seek up to 15,000 beds to detain families. The Justice Department has also asked a federal court in California to allow children to be detained longer and in facilities that don’t require state licensing while they await immigration court proceedings.
“The current situation is untenable,” August Flentje, special counsel to the assistant attorney general, wrote in court filings seeking to change a longstanding court settlement that governs the detention of immigrant children. The more constrained the Homeland Security Department is in detaining families together during immigration proceedings, “the more likely it is that families will attempt illegal border crossing.”
The proposed expansion comes days after a public outcry moved the administration to cease the practice of separating children from their migrant parents on the border. More than 2,300 children have been taken from their parents since Homeland Security announced a plan in April to prosecute all immigrants caught on the border.
WATCH: Trump pushes back against criticism of family separation
In all, about 9,000 immigrants traveling in family groups have been caught on the border in each of the last three months, according to federal authorities.
Immigrant advocates contend detention is no place for children and insist there are other alternatives to ensure they and their parents attend immigration court hearings, such as ankle bracelets or community-based programs. The federal court ruled several years ago that children must be released as quickly as possible from family detention.
“It is definitely not a solution under any circumstances,” said Manoj Govindaiah, director of family detention services at the RAICES advocacy group in Texas. “At no point should a child be incarcerated, and children need to be with their parents.”
Immigration and Customs Enforcement currently has three family detention facilities — a 100-bed center opened in Pennsylvania in 2001 and two much larger facilities opened in Texas in 2014. Only the Pennsylvania facility can house men, and all of the detainees at the Texas centers are women with children.
In Dilley, Texas, a facility was built on a remote site that was once an oil workers’ encampment. It includes collections of cottages built around playgrounds. The other Texas center, in Karnes City, is ringed by 15-foot fences and has security cameras monitoring movements. It also offers bilingual children’s books in the library, classes, TVs and an artificial turf soccer field.
Inside the Karnes City center, there are five or six beds to a room typically shared by a couple of families. Cinderblock walls are painted pastel colors, said Govindaiah, who added that the facilities are run by private prison operators, not humanitarian organizations, as is the case with shelters for unaccompanied immigrant children.

Currently, most families spend up to a few weeks in the facilities and are released once they pass an initial asylum screening. They are then given a date to appear before an immigration judge in the cities where they are headed to see if they qualify to stay in the country legally or will face deportation.
Those who do not pass initial screenings can seek additional review in a video conference with a judge, a process that lasts about six weeks.
But that’s much shorter than the six months or a year many families were being held several years ago when the Obama administration began detaining mothers and children in a bid to stem a surge in arrivals on the border, Govindaiah said.
At the time, many were being held until their immigration cases — not just the initial screenings — were resolved.
Advocates then asked the federal court to enforce a decades-old settlement over the detention of immigrant children, and a judge ruled the children should be released as quickly as possible.
The settlement is seen by advocates as a way to ensure children are placed in age-appropriate facilities and for no longer than necessary. State licensing adds another layer of oversight.
“You will have children in facilities that are entirely inappropriate for children and are not meeting child welfare standards,” said Michelle Brane, director of the migrant rights and justice program at the Women’s Refugee Commission. “They are trying to circumvent child welfare standards.”
Brane said there is a viable alternative: supervised release to communities around the country. The federal Family Case Management Program — terminated under the Trump administration — compiled a perfect record of attendance by migrants at court hearings, and a 99 percent appearance record at immigration check-ins, according to a 2017 report by the Homeland Security inspector general.
Just 2 percent of participants — 23 out of 954 — were reported as absconders.
In Friday’s notice, ICE said the family detention beds should be in state-licensed facilities and allow freedom of movement for detainees, and should preferably be located in states along the southwest border.
In addition to providing private showers and educational field trips for children, the centers should appear “child-friendly rather than penal in nature,” the agency said.

Multiple detainees say the guards stripped them of their clothes and strapped them to chairs with bags placed over their heads.
“Whenever they used to restrain me and put me in the chair, they would handcuff me,” said a Honduran immigrant who was sent to the facility when he was 15 years old. “Strapped me down all the way, from your feet all the way to your chest, you couldn’t really move. … They have total control over you. They also put a bag over your head. It has little holes; you can see through it. But you feel suffocated with the bag on.”
In addition to the children’s first-hand, translated accounts in court filings, a former child-development specialist who worked inside the facility independently told The Associated Press this week that she saw kids there with bruises and broken bones they blamed on guards. She spoke on condition of anonymity because she was not authorized to publicly discuss the children’s cases.
In court filings, lawyers for the detention facility have denied all allegations of physical abuse.
Many of the children were sent there after U.S. immigration authorities accused them of belonging to violent gangs, including MS-13. President Donald Trump has repeatedly cited gang activity as justification for his crackdown on illegal immigration.
Trump said Wednesday that “our Border Patrol agents and our ICE agents have done one great job” cracking down on MS-13 gang members. “We’re throwing them out by the thousands,” he said.

But a top manager at the Shenandoah center said during a recent congressional hearing that the children did not appear to be gang members and were suffering from mental health issues resulting from trauma that happened in their home countries — problems the detention facility is ill-equipped to treat.
“The youth were being screened as gang-involved individuals. And then when they came into our care, and they were assessed by our clinical and case management staff … they weren’t necessarily identified as gang-involved individuals,” said Kelsey Wong, a program director at the facility. She testified April 26 before a Senate subcommittee reviewing the treatment of immigrant children apprehended by the Homeland Security Department.
Most children held in the Shenandoah facility who were the focus of the lawsuit were caught crossing the border illegally alone. They were not the children who have been separated from their families under the Trump administration’s recent policy.
Most children held in the Shenandoah facility who were the focus of the abuse lawsuit were caught crossing the border illegally alone. They were not the children who have been separated from their families under the Trump administration’s recent policy and are now in the government’s care. But the facility there operates under the same program run by the U.S. Office of Refugee Resettlement. It was not immediately clear whether any separated children have been sent to Shenandoah Valley since the Trump administration in April announced its “zero tolerance” policy toward immigrant families, after the lawsuit was filed.

The Shenandoah lockup is one of only three juvenile detention facilities in the United States with federal contracts to provide “secure placement” for children who had problems at less-restrictive housing. The Yolo County Juvenile Detention Facility in California has faced litigation over immigrant children mischaracterized as gang members. In Alexandria, Virginia, a board overseeing the Northern Virginia Juvenile Detention Center voted this week to end its contract to house federal immigration detainees, bowing to public pressure.
The Shenandoah detention center was built by a coalition of seven nearby towns and counties to lock up local kids charged with serious crimes. Since 2007, about half the 58 beds are occupied by both male and female immigrants between the ages of 12 and 17 facing deportation proceedings or awaiting rulings on asylum claims. Though incarcerated in a facility similar to a prison, the children detained on administrative immigration charges have not yet been convicted of any crime.
Virginia ranks among the worst states in the nation for wait times in federal immigration courts, with an average of 806 days before a ruling. Nationally, only about half of juveniles facing deportation are represented by a lawyer, according to Justice Department data.
On average, 92 immigrant children each year cycle through Shenandoah, most of them from Mexico and Central America.
Wong said many of the 30 or so children housed there on any given day have mental health needs that would be better served in a residential treatment unit. But such facilities are often unwilling to accept children with significant behavioral issues, she said.

Wong and other managers at the Shenandoah center, including Executive Director Timothy J. Smith, did not respond to phone and email messages seeking comment this week. A city manager on the local commission that oversees the facility referred questions to an official at the Refugee Resettlement agency, who did not respond to a phone message.
Financial statements reviewed by AP shows the local government commission that operates the center received nearly $4.2 million in federal funds last year to house the immigrant children — enough to cover about two-thirds of the total operating expenses.
The lawsuit filed against Shenandoah alleges that young Latino immigrants held there “are subjected to unconstitutional conditions that shock the conscience, including violence by staff, abusive and excessive use of seclusion and restraints, and the denial of necessary mental health care.”
The complaint filed by the nonprofit Washington Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights and Urban Affairs recounts the story of an unnamed 17-year-old Mexican citizen apprehended at the southern border. The teen fled an abusive father and violence fueled by drug cartels to seek asylum in the United States in 2015.
After stops at facilities in Texas and New York, he was transferred to Shenandoah in April 2016 and diagnosed during an initial screening by a psychologist with three mental disorders, including depression. Besides weekly sessions speaking with a counselor, the lawsuit alleges the teen has received no further mental health treatment, such as medications that might help regulate his moods and behavior.
The lawsuit recounts multiple alleged violent incidents between Latino children and staff at the Shenandoah center. It describes the guards as mostly white, non-Spanish speakers who are undertrained in dealing with individuals with mental illness. The suit alleges staff members routinely taunt the Latino youths with racially charged epithets, including “wetback,” ”onion head” and “pendejo,” which roughly translates to dumbass in Spanish.
A 16-year-old who said he had lived in Texas with his mother since he was an infant ended up at Shenandoah in September after a police officer pulled over a car he was riding in and asked for ID, which he couldn’t provide. As one of the few Latino kids who is fluent in English, the teen would translate for other detainees the taunts and names the staff members were calling them. He said that angered the guards, resulting in his losing such modest privileges as attending art classes.
“If you are behaving bad, resisting the staff when they try to remove you from the program, they will take everything in your room away — your mattress, blanket, everything,” he said. “They will also take your clothes. Then they will leave you locked in there for a while. This has happened to me, and I know it has happened to other kids, too.”
The immigrant detainees said they were largely segregated from the mostly white juveniles being held on criminal charges, but they could see that the other housing units had amenities that included plush chairs and video gaming consoles not available in the Spartan pods housing the Latinos.
In their sworn statements, the teens reported spending the bulk of their days locked alone in their cells, with a few hours set aside for classroom instruction, recreation and meals. Some said they had never been allowed outdoors, while the U.S.-born children were afforded a spacious recreation yard.
The Latino children reported being fed sparse and often cold meals that left them hungry, though meals of American fast food were occasionally provided. Records show Shenandoah receives nearly $82,000 a year from the Agriculture Department to feed the immigration detainees.
The lawsuit said the poor conditions, frequent physical searches and verbal abuse by staff often escalated into confrontations, as the frustrated children acted out. The staff regularly responded “by physically assaulting the youth, applying an excessive amount of force that goes far beyond what is needed to establish or regain control.”

In the case of the Mexican 17-year-old, the lawsuit said a staff member who suspected him of possessing contraband threw him to the ground and forcibly tore off his clothes for an impromptu strip search. Though no forbidden items were found, the teenager was transferred to “Alpha Pod,” described in the lawsuit as a unit within the facility designated for children who engage in bad behavior.
The lawsuit said Latino children were frequently punished by being restrained for hours in chairs, with handcuffs and cloth shackles on their legs. Often, the lawsuit alleged, the children were beaten by staff while bound.
As a result of such “malicious and sadistic applications of force,” the immigrant youths have “sustained significant injuries, both physical and psychological,” the lawsuit said.
After an altercation during which the lawsuit alleged the Mexican teenager bit a staff member during a beating, he was restrained in handcuffs and shackles for 10 days, resulting in bruises and cuts. Other teens interviewed as part of the court case also reported being punished for minor infractions with stints in solitary confinement, during which some of the children said they were left nude and shivering in cold concrete cells.
Academic studies of prison inmates kept in solitary confinement have found they often experience high anxiety that can cause panic attacks, paranoia and disordered thinking that may trigger angry outbursts. For those with mental health issues, the effects can be exacerbated, often worsening the very behaviors the staff is attempting to discourage.
A Guatemalan youth sent to the center when he was 14 years old said he was often locked in his tiny cell for up to 23 hours a day. After resisting the guards, he said he was also restrained for long periods.
“When they couldn’t get one of the kids to calm down, the guards would put us in a chair — a safety chair, I don’t know what they call it — but they would just put us in there all day,” the teen said in a sworn statement. “This happened to me, and I saw it happen to others, too. It was excessive.”
A 15-year-old from Mexico held at Shenandoah for nine months also recounted being restrained with a bag over his head.
“They handcuffed me and put a white bag of some kind over my head,” he said, according to his sworn statement. “They took off all of my clothes and put me into a restraint chair, where they attached my hands and feet to the chair. They also put a strap across my chest. They left me naked and attached to that chair for two and a half days, including at night.”
After being subjected to such treatment, the 17-year-old Mexican youth said he tried to kill himself in August, only to be punished with further isolation. On other occasions, he said, he has responded to feelings of desperation and hopelessness by cutting his wrists with a piece of glass and banging his head against the wall or floor.
“One time I cut myself after I had gotten into a fight with staff,” the teen recounted. “I filled the room with blood. This happened on a Friday, but it wasn’t until Monday that they gave me a bandage or medicine for the pain.”
The lawsuit alleges other immigrant youths held at Shenandoah have also engaged in cutting and other self-harming behaviors, including ingesting shampoo and attempting to choke themselves.
A hearing in the case is set for July 3 before a federal judge in the Western District of Virginia.
Lawyers on both sides in the lawsuit either did not respond to messages or declined to comment, citing strict confidentiality requirements in the case involving children.
The child development specialist who previously worked with teens at Shenandoah told AP that many there developed severe psychological problems after experiencing abuse from guards.
“The majority of the kids we worked with when we went to visit them were emotionally and verbally abused. I had a kid whose foot was broken by a guard,” she said. “They would get put in isolation for months for things like picking up a pencil when a guard had said not to move. Some of them started hearing voices that were telling them to hurt people or hurt themselves, and I knew when they had gotten to Shenandoah they were not having any violent thoughts.”
She said she never witnessed staff abuse teens first-hand, but that teens would complain to her of injuries from being tackled by guards and reveal bruises. The specialist encouraged them to file a formal complaint.
Though lawyers for Shenandoah responded with court filings denying all wrongdoing, information contained in a separate 2016 lawsuit appears to support some of the information contained in the recent abuse complaints.
In a wrongful termination lawsuit filed against the Shenandoah center, a former staff member said he worked in unit called “Alpha Pod” where immigrant minors were held, “including those with psychological and mental issues and those who tend to fight more frequently.”
The guard, Trenton Farris, who denied claims that he punched two children, sued the justice center alleging he was wrongly targeted for firing because he is black. Farris said most staff members at the facility are white, and that two white staff members involved in the incident over which he was fired went unpunished.
Lawyers for the center denied the former guard’s claims, and the case was settled in January.

“We are pleased that the president is calling a halt to his inhumane and heartless policy of separating parents from their children,” said Peter Schey, the lawyer in a lawsuit that resulted in a key agreement governing the treatment of migrant children in detention called the Flores settlement.
Despite the president’s order, Schey said he was concerned that several thousand children have already been separated from their parents “without the Trump administration having any effective procedures in place to reunite children with their parents, many of whom have already been deported.
Trump said Wednesday he didn’t like seeing children being removed from their families, a recent practice that has sparked worldwide outrage. But he also said “zero tolerance” on illegal immigration continues, and children will be held with their parents while the adults are prosecuted.
It remains unclear what will happen with the more than 2,300 children separated from their parents at the border in recent weeks. Officials have said they are working to reunite families as soon as possible but have provided no clear answers on how that will happen.
WATCH: What asylum-seekers meet when they try to cross legally
“This is a stopgap measure,” said Gene Hamilton, counsel to the U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Justice Department lawyers were planning to file a challenge to the Flores settlement, which requires the government to release children from custody and to their parents, adult relatives or other caretakers, in order of preference.
If those options are exhausted, authorities must find the “least restrictive” setting for a child who arrived without parents.
Justice Department lawyers will seek permission to allow for the detention of families until criminal and removal proceedings are completed.
Delaware Sen. Tom Carper said he was concerned about whether parents can track down their kids. “I am also deeply troubled to hear reports that the administration, in its haste to hold innocent children hostage in order to demand funds for a border wall, failed to plan appropriately to reunite these families following their separation,” the Democrat said.
Kay Bellor, vice president for programs at Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service, among the largest refugee resettlement agencies in the U.S., said: “While children will no longer be ripped from the arms of their parents for the sole purpose of deterring immigration, they will go to jail with their parents. Jail is never an appropriate place for a child.”

New York Mayor Bill de Blasio on Wednesday went to a center in Manhattan that is caring for 239 migrant children separated from their parents.
– Manuel Padilla, chief of the U.S. Border Patrol’s Rio Grande sector
De Blasio told reporters the children at Harlem’s Cayuga Center included a 9-year-old Honduran boy sent to the center 2,000 miles by bus after being detained at the border. He said the youngest child there is 9 months old.
The center is operated under a federal contract that places unaccompanied migrant children in short-term foster care. De Blasio said staff members reported seeing about 350 children since the launch of the “zero tolerance” policy.
“It looked like the kids were being treated very well,” the mayor said, but added several arrived with lice, bed bugs or chicken pox.
On South Texas’ border with Mexico, Manuel Padilla, chief of the U.S. Border Patrol’s Rio Grande sector, told The Associated Press on Tuesday that the current situation for migrant children in the U.S. “is not ideal,” but the children are treated “very well.”
“The ideal situation is for these children and family units to be in their home country in a stable situation,” he said.
The lines of asylum seekers at some locations on the border seem to have waned in recent days as the U.S. government’s treatment of migrants has come under scrutiny.
Two Guatemalan sisters, ages 20 and 24, nevertheless continued waiting Wednesday on a bridge connecting the Mexican city of Matamoros with Brownsville, Texas.
Josseline Garcia, the younger sister, told the AP she knew that ICE could detain them indefinitely. But, she said, “we are waiting our turn, and hoping.”

https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/a-fifth-of-immigrant-children-detained-under-zero-tolerance-policy-are-younger-than-13,refugee,991,2018-06-20T14:35:40-04:00,"Shefali Luthra, Kaiser Health News",A fifth of immigrant children detained under ‘zero tolerance’ policy are younger than 13,"The Trump administration has detained 2,322 children 12 years old or younger amid its border crackdown, a Department of Health and Human Services official told Kaiser Health News on Wednesday. They represent almost 20 percent of the immigrant children currently held by the U.S. government in the wake of its latest immigrant prosecution policy.
Their welfare is being overseen by a small division of the Department of Health and Human Services — the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) — which has little experience or expertise in handling very young children.
The number of children has exploded in the past six weeks since the Trump administration moved to stop parents and their children at the U.S. border and separate and detain them in different facilities. A total of 11,786 children under age 18 are currently detained, the official said.
Since 2003, ORR has been charged with sheltering and finding suitable homes for “unaccompanied alien children” — generally teenaged immigrants who reach the United States without a parent or guardian.
But its responsibilities have morphed and multiplied since April because the immigration crackdown means that the ORR is now responsible for detaining not only more children, but minors who are far younger than those who had arrived in the past, experts said.
Beyond specialized medical care, younger children have different food and housing needs, and require more personal attention.
“The children are younger and will be there for a longer time and are deeply traumatized by being forcibly separated from their parents,” said Mark Greenberg, a former administration official at HHS’ Administration for Children and Families, which oversees the ORR. “All of that makes it much more difficult to operate the program.”
The complex crisis is magnified by the inexperience of some of the political appointees leading the response, said critics who include former officials from both Republican and Democratic administrations of the past decade.
ORR Director Scott Lloyd is a lawyer whose career has been focused on anti-abortion efforts. He led the Trump administration’s legal efforts to prevent abortions for detained teen immigrants. Lloyd’s main immigration experience before leading ORR was research for a report on refugees for the Knights of Columbus, a Catholic service organization with an anti-abortion stance, according to a deposition he gave in lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union.
Kenneth Wolfe, the HHS spokesman who provided the figures, declined to address how many people are currently working at ORR or whether ORR had secured additional staff or expertise to cope with the influx of young children. He also would not say how many of the 2,322 children 12 and younger have been separated from their families.
The administration had previously refused to provide the ages of the children separated from their families — saying only that about 2,300 children have been separated and detained since the policy took effect.
The detention conditions, which include children being held in chain-link holding pens and “tent cities,” have ignited a political firestorm over possible abuse in the treatment of children as young as 4. Some of these younger children — including toddlers — are being sent to “tender age” shelters, according to media reports. The care is also costly: Tents alone cost HHS $775 per person per day, according to media reports.
Republicans, including former first lady Laura Bush, have called on the administration to stop the policy. President Donald Trump has blamed Congress for the detentions, but top White House advisers were actively promoting family separations as a policy shift.
News reports have described children as young as 5 being scolded for playing, one teenager teaching others how to change a small child’s diaper, and caretakers not being permitted to touch children. ProPublica reported that more than 100 children detained are younger than 4.
ORR, experts add, is already at a disadvantage.
“It’s significantly challenging to create that capacity, and quite expensive,” noted Robert Carey, a former ORR director from the Obama administration. “All the aspects of care are dramatically different based on age. … You need people who are trained in early childhood development or care.”
That’s a heavy lift for an office that, experts stress, was never built to serve as a long-term housing system.
It’s not clear, Carey and others said, that the administration has had sufficient time or support to adapt.
Many ORR employees, Carey added, are career staffers with deep knowledge about immigration and child welfare, with whom he frequently worked while in office.
“The kids are going into the custody of ORR without adequate resources,” said Shadi Houshyar, who directs early childhood and child welfare initiatives at Families USA, an advocacy group. “It’s definitely going to result in some potentially damaging decisions being made. The capacity, training and fundamental orientation — while understanding the needs of children — is not the orientation that ORR has.”
While ORR has a history of placing teenagers who arrive on their own with relatives of families in the U.S., that challenge is heightened by the policy of separating children, who are young and may understand little of the experience or be able to identify relatives who could take them in.
Making matters more complicated, when families are separated, parents and children are tracked by different federal agencies — the parents by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, and the children by ORR. Children are also tracked and treated the same as minors who arrived on their own. Together, that makes reunification more difficult. And that’s a problem experts worry will persist, even if family separations cease.
“It does not look like they’ve figured out this process,” said a former HHS official, who requested anonymity because she could face professional ramifications for speaking publicly. As a result, she added, “the time the child stays in ORR could be significantly longer” — which in turn adds to trauma and causes other long-term problems.

Lawyers and medical providers who have visited the Rio Grande Valley shelters described play rooms of crying preschool-age children in crisis. The government also plans to open a fourth shelter to house hundreds of young migrant children in Houston, where city leaders denounced the move Tuesday.
Since the White House announced its zero tolerance policy in early May, more than 2,300 children have been taken from their parents at the U.S.-Mexico border, resulting in a new influx of young children requiring government care. The government has faced withering critiques over images of some of the children in cages inside U.S. Border Patrol processing stations.
Decades after the nation’s child welfare system ended the use of orphanages over concerns about the lasting trauma to children, the administration is standing up new institutions to hold Central American toddlers that the government separated from their parents.
“The thought that they are going to be putting such little kids in an institutional setting? I mean it is hard for me to even wrap my mind around it,” said Kay Bellor, vice president for programs at Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service, which provides foster care and other child welfare services to migrant children. “Toddlers are being detained.”
Bellor said shelters follow strict procedures surrounding who can gain access to the children in order to protect their safety, but that means information about their welfare can be limited.
By law, child migrants traveling alone must be sent to facilities run by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services within three days of being detained. The agency then is responsible for placing the children in shelters or foster homes until they are united with a relative or sponsor in the community as they await immigration court hearings.
But U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions’ announcement last month that the government would criminally prosecute everyone who crosses the U.S.-Mexico border illegally has led to the breakup of migrant families and sent a new group of hundreds of young children into the government’s care.
The United Nations, some Democratic and Republican lawmakers and religious groups have sharply criticized the policy, calling it inhumane.
Not so, said Steven Wagner, an official with the Department of Health and Human Services.
“We have specialized facilities that are devoted to providing care to children with special needs and tender age children as we define as under 13 would fall into that category,” he said. “They’re not government facilities per se, and they have very well-trained clinicians, and those facilities meet state licensing standards for child welfare agencies, and they’re staffed by people who know how to deal with the needs — particularly of the younger children.”
Until now, however, it’s been unknown where they are.
“In general we do not identify the locations of permanent unaccompanied alien children program facilities,” said agency spokesman Kenneth Wolfe.
The three centers — in Combes, Raymondville and Brownsville — have been rapidly repurposed to serve needs of children including some under 5. A fourth, planned for Houston, would house up to 240 children in a warehouse previously used for people displaced by Hurricane Harvey, Mayor Sylvester Turner said.
Turner said he met with officials from Austin-based Southwest Key Programs, the contractor that operates some of the child shelters, to ask them to reconsider their plans. A spokeswoman for Southwest Key didn’t immediately reply to an email seeking comment.
“And so there comes a point in time we draw a line and for me, the line is with these children,” said Turner during a news conference Tuesday.
On a practical level, the zero tolerance policy has overwhelmed the federal agency charged with caring for the new influx of children who tend to be much younger than teens who typically have been traveling to the U.S. alone. Indeed some recent detainees are infants, taken from their mothers.
Doctors and lawyers who have visited the shelters said the facilities were fine, clean and safe, but the kids — who have no idea where their parents are — were hysterical, crying and acting out.
“The shelters aren’t the problem, it’s taking kids from their parents that’s the problem,” said South Texas pediatrician Marsha Griffin who has visited many.
Alicia Lieberman, who runs the Early Trauma Treatment Network at University of California, San Francisco, said decades of study show early separations can cause permanent emotional damage.
“Children are biologically programmed to grow best in the care of a parent figure. When that bond is broken through long and unexpected separations with no set timeline for reunion, children respond at the deepest physiological and emotional levels,” she said. “Their fear triggers a flood of stress hormones that disrupt neural circuits in the brain, create high levels of anxiety, make them more susceptible to physical and emotional illness, and damage their capacity to manage their emotions, trust people, and focus their attention on age-appropriate activities.”
Days after Sessions announced the zero-tolerance policy, the government issued a call for proposals from shelter and foster care providers to provide services for the new influx of children taken from their families after journeying from Honduras, El Salvador, Guatemala and Mexico.
As children are separated from their families, law enforcement agents reclassify them from members of family units to “unaccompanied alien children.” Federal officials said Tuesday that since May, they have separated 2,342 children from their families, rendering them unaccompanied minors in the government’s care.
While Mexico is still the most common country of origin for families arrested at the border, in the last eight months Honduras has become the fastest-growing category as compared to fiscal year 2017.
During a press briefing Tuesday, reporters repeatedly asked for an age breakdown of the children who have been taken. Officials from both law enforcement and Health and Human Services said they didn’t know how many children were under 5, under 2, or even so little they’re non-verbal.
“The facilities that they have for the most part are not licensed for tender age children,” said Michelle Brane, director of migrant rights at the Women’s Refugee Commission, who met with a 4-year-old girl in diapers in a McAllen warehouse where Border Patrol temporarily holds migrant families. “There is no model for how you house tons of little children in cots institutionally in our country. We don’t do orphanages, our child welfare has recognized that is an inappropriate setting for little children.”
So now, the government has to try to hire more caregivers.
The recent call for proposals by the federal government’s Office of Refugee Resettlement said it was seeking applicants who can provide services for a diverse population “of all ages and genders, as well as pregnant and parenting teens.”
Even the policy surrounding what age to take away a baby is inconsistent. Customs and Border Protection field chiefs over all nine southwest border districts can use their discretion over how young is too young, officials said. And while Health and Human Services defines “tender age” typically as 12 and under, Customs and Border Protection has at times defined it as 5 and under.
For 30 years, Los Fresnos, Texas-based International Education Services ran emergency shelters and foster care programs for younger children and pregnant teens who arrived in the U.S. as unaccompanied minors. At least one resident sued for the right to have an abortion in a high-profile case last March.
For reasons the agency did not explain, three months ago the government’s refugee resettlement office said it was ending their funding to the program and transferred all children to other facilities. This came weeks before the administration began its “zero tolerance” policy, prompting a surge in “tender age” migrant children needing shelter.
In recent days, members of Congress have been visiting the shelters and processing centers, or watching news report about them, bearing witness to the growing chaos. In a letter sent to Attorney General Jeff Sessions on Tuesday, a dozen Republican senators said separating families isn’t consistent with American values and ordinary human decency.
On Tuesday, a Guatemalan mother who hasn’t seen her 7-year-old son since he was taken from her a month ago sued the Trump administration. Beata Mariana de Jesus Mejia-Mejia was released from custody while her asylum case is pending and thinks her son, Darwin, might be in a shelter in Arizona.
“I only got to talk to him once and he sounded so sad. My son never used to sound like that, he was such a dynamic boy,” Mejia-Mejia said as she wept. “I call and call and no one will tell me where he is.”

John McCain and Democratic Sen. Chris Coons called on President Donald Trump’s administration Tuesday to withdraw its nominee for a key State Department position over his “lack of empathy” for immigrants. The appeal comes as the president faces mushrooming outrage over treatment of migrant families at the border.
In a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, the pair wrote that Ronald Mortensen, Trump’s nominee for assistant secretary of state for Population, Refugees and Migration, “has spread misinformation about immigrants.” They said they strongly oppose his nomination, accusing Mortensen of displaying “a lack of empathy for innocent men, women, and children fleeing violence and oppression.”
Sent letter w/ @ChrisCoons urging the admin to withdraw nomination of Ronald Mortensen to lead US refugee & migration policy. Mortensen has spread misinformation about immigrants & displayed a lack of empathy for innocent people fleeing oppression. https://t.co/H3jfK32qX1
— John McCain (@SenJohnMcCain) June 19, 2018
“We are deeply concerned about the possibility of a virulent opponent of immigration serving as the United States’ senior diplomat for migration and refugee policies,” the senators wrote in a letter obtained by The Associated Press.
Mortensen, a retired foreign service officer and U.S. Agency for International Development official, was nominated in May. If confirmed by the Republican-controlled Senate, he would oversee the State Department unit that deals with refugee resettlement and assistance to displaced people, including those fleeing conflict.
He is known for his outspoken views on immigration, including as a fellow at the Center for Immigration Studies, a think tank that the Southern Poverty Law Center, which monitors domestic extremism, has deemed a hate group. The center describes itself as a nonpartisan research organization on the impact of immigration on the U.S.
McCain and Coons said Mortensen had “attacked American religious leaders for sheltering and assisting immigrants,” calling his public comments undiplomatic and “antithetical to America’s long history of welcoming immigrants.” Their letter referenced essays by Mortensen posted on the think tank’s website, including one in which he referred to the Obama-era policy of granting work permits for “Dreamers” — young immigrants brought to the U.S. illegally as children — as “elite-driven child abuse.”
The State Department confirmed that it had received the letter but said only that it would “respond as appropriate.” Mortensen couldn’t be reached for comment.
But Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, defended Mortensen’s nomination and said his views on immigration were not relevant to overseeing aid to refugees and displaced people oversees. He pointed to Mortensen’s long career in government providing humanitarian assistance in places like Mali, Sudan, Haiti and Syria.
“Ron Mortensen has delivered more food to the hungry and clothes to the naked and medicine to the sick than every single joker in the U.S. Congress put together,” Krikorian said in an interview. Of McCain, he added: “It’s no surprise that McCain would team up with a Democrat to criticize someone who is hawkish on immigration. That’s been McCain’s M.O. for a long time.”
McCain, who is in Arizona fighting brain cancer, is one of a growing number of GOP lawmakers expressing concern about the Trump administration’s “zero tolerance” approach to illegal border crossings that has drawn widespread scrutiny over the forced separation of migrant children from their parents. He and Coons, of Delaware, wrote that Trump should withdraw Mortensen’s nomination and instead “nominate someone who is committed to the United States’ legacy of promoting the human rights of displaced people.”
“The nomination of Mr. Mortensen for this position sends a chilling message to all those around the world who look to the United States as a beacon of hope and security for persecuted peoples,” McCain and Coons wrote."

So Blanca Orantes-Lopez, her 8-year-old boy and his father packed up and left the Pacific surfing town of Puerto La Libertad in El Salvador and headed for the United States.
Two months later, she sits in a federal prison south of Seattle. The boy, Abel Alexander, is in custody at a children’s home across the country in upstate New York. She has no idea when she might see him again.
“I still haven’t been able to talk to him,” Orantes told The Associated Press in Spanish as she wept through a telephone interview Monday from the prison. “The most difficult is not seeing him.”
Her story is emblematic of the 2,000 instances in which President Donald Trump’s administration has separated minors from their migrant parents in an effort to deter illegal immigration. The practice has provoked a national uproar fueled by stories of children being torn from their mothers’ arms and of parents being deported without their kids.

The administration adopted a new “zero tolerance” policy in April designed to curb a wave of Central American migrants who say they are fleeing violence at home. Homeland Security officials now refer all cases of illegal entry for prosecution.
Authorities say they are required to remove the children before they can prosecute the parents, but many parents, including Orantes, have remained separated from their children long after being convicted.
Trump has both applauded the practice and falsely blamed Democrats for it.
“We will not apologize for the job we do or for the job law enforcement does, for doing the job that the American people expect us to do,” Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen told the National Sheriffs’ Association in New Orleans. “Illegal actions have and must have consequences. No more free passes, no more get-out-of-jail-free cards.”
The phone call that prompted Orantes’ monthlong journey to the U.S. border was no idle threat, she said. About three years ago, Abel’s uncle was kidnapped by extortionists and freed only after the family paid up, according to her attorney, Matt Adams, legal director of the Seattle-based Northwest Immigrant Rights Project.

“When they don’t get their money, they kill people,” said Orantes, 26.
This time, the demand was more than they could muster. And they had only a week to pay, she said.
She and her son split from the boy’s father in Guatemala. He remains in hiding, and Orantes said she does not know where he is. Upon reaching the border, she and Abel found it impossible to apply for asylum at a port of entry, Adams said.
“A lot of people are showing up at the border to apply for asylum and are being told, ‘We don’t have capacity for them,'” Adams said. “It’s not like they can just stand in a line for several days, because then the Mexican officials will grab them and deport them. So they’re then forced to go through the ravine or the river.”
That’s what they did. The pair crossed illegally into Texas and immediately reported themselves to immigration authorities and requested asylum, Adams said.
They were separated so Orantes could be prosecuted.
The woman said she was moved to different detention facilities, including in Laredo, Texas, and placed among other desperate, crying mothers. At one point, officials brought Abel to her, she said.
“They told me, ‘Say bye to him because he’s being transferred.’ I asked where,” she recounted. “They just told me to say bye to him. … He just started crying, saying, ‘Don’t leave me, Mom.’
“I just said, ‘It’ll be OK.’ That’s all I said.”

Orantes was detained on May 22 with about 20 other people near Roma, Texas, Immigration and Customs Enforcement said. She was convicted of the misdemeanor of unlawfully entering the U.S. and was sentenced to time served — a development she thought would reunify her with Abel.
Instead, with detention centers overflowing on the border, she became one of more than 1,600 detainees transferred by ICE to federal prisons.
She was sent June 6 to the Federal Detention Center at SeaTac, where she remains with more than 200 other border detainees, waiting to hear whether her asylum request will proceed. The conditions there are better than they were at the immigration jails, she said.

– Matt Adams, Northwest Immigrant Rights Project legal director
Before Trump’s policy changes, she likely would not have been prosecuted, but instead allowed to remain with her son and granted an interview to determine whether she had a credible fear of persecution or torture in her home country. If officials found that she did, she and Abel would probably have been released while their immigration case continued.

It was weeks before she learned her son’s whereabouts, she said. She has not spoken with him. Her attorney said she has no money and is not allowed to make collect calls to the facility in Kingston, New York, where he is held. The boy has been able to call her sister, Maria Orantes, who lives in Maryland and has petitioned for custody, without success.
“He doesn’t feel well there,” Maria Orantes said in a phone interview. “When he calls, he’s crying. He doesn’t want to be there.”
The Department of Health and Human Services, whose Office of Refugee Resettlement oversees the placement of migrant children separated from their families, did not immediately return an email seeking comment about why the boy had not been placed with his aunt.
Blanca Orantes said she had hoped to live with her sister.
“I wanted to work,” she said. “Raise my kid. Be a good person, get ahead, have some money and not hide. I thought it would be different.”"

The annual report, released ahead of World Refugee Day on Wednesday, suggested that on average, a person became displaced every two seconds last year.
Violence in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the war in South Sudan and the persecution of Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar fueled last year’s displacement numbers.
Of the 68.5 million people who were forcibly displaced, 25.4 million were refugees who fled their home countries, 40 million were considered internally displaced people who never actually left their countries of origin and 3.1 million were asylum seekers who were waiting for the outcome of their applications for refugee status.
“Today, on the eve of World Refugee Day, my message to member states is please support this,” U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi said in a statement. “No one becomes a refugee by choice; but the rest of us can have a choice about how we help.”
Colombia remained the country with the largest internally displaced population for the second year in a row, with 7.7 million people. Syria had the second highest tally with 6.2 million.

Internal displacement was largely caused by “armed conflict, generalized violence, or human rights violations,” UNHCR stated. The report noted that 2017 marked the second straight year that the number of internally displaced people decreased. That count fell by about 300,000 people in 2017.
But the number of refugees who fled their home countries rose for the sixth straight year, increasing by 2.9 million in 2017 — the biggest increase the UNHCR has ever recorded in a single year.
The global refugee population stood at 25.4 million at the end of 2017, the report said. That figure included 5.4 million Palestinian refugees who were under the watch of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency.
Of the remaining 19.9 million refugees under UNHCR’s watch, nearly two-thirds came from just five countries: Syria with 6.3 million, Afghanistan with 2.6 million, South Sudan with 2.4 million, Myanmar with 1.2 million and Somalia with 986,400.
The figures debunked the perception that the refugee crisis primarily affects developed nations. According to the report, low-income developing nations hosted about 85 percent of the world’s refugees under UNHCR’s watch. Turkey topped the list of countries that hosted the most refugees last year, with 3.5 million.

The United States received the largest number of new asylum claims in 2017 with 331,700, though a recent Pew Research Center study suggests the U.S. is admitting fewer refugees. Last year represented the first time since 2012 that the U.S. topped the list.
Most of the 3.1 million asylum seekers originated from Afghanistan, which overtook Syria as the top source of applications last year.
“We are at a watershed, where success in managing forced displacement globally requires a new and far more comprehensive approach so that countries and communities aren’t left dealing with this alone,” Grandi said.
The agency said it hopes its new blueprint for addressing refugee crises, the Global Compact on Refugees, will help the international community cooperate more closely when responding to the issue."

The organization included “gaming disorder” in the latest edition of its International Classification of Diseases, a guide used by medical practitioners and researchers to diagnose and categorize conditions.
The disorder, according to the WHO, is characterized by “impaired control over gaming, increasing priority given to gaming over other activities to the extent that gaming takes precedence over other interests and daily activities, and continuation or escalation of gaming despite the occurrence of negative consequences.”
Dr. Vladimir Poznyak of the WHO’s Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse said that in order for gaming to be diagnosed as a disorder, a person usually has to exhibit those characteristics for at least 12 months. He added that a health professional must be the one to make the diagnosis. [The Washington Post]
Why it matters:
The WHO said it decided to include compulsive gaming in the latest version of its guide in part because classifying it as a disorder can help countries plan public health strategies and monitor trends. It can also make it easier to find treatment and ways to afford it, the Washington Post reported.
Still, the WHO noted that gaming disorder affects only a small percentage — about 3 percent — of the 2 million people who play video games.
Dr. Joan Harvey, a spokeswoman for the British Psychological Society, told the Associated Press that the designation shouldn’t alarm parents of young gamers.
“People need to understand this doesn’t mean every child who spends hours in their room playing games is an addict, otherwise medics are going to be flooded with requests for help,” she said.
Parents should monitor the amount of time children spend gaming and look for signs that it’s replacing other daily activities, as well as any changes in physical or psychological health and social functioning that could be attributed to a pattern of gaming behaviour, the WHO said.

The University of Chicago announced last week that it will no longer require SAT or ACT scores for admission of American undergraduate students.
The university said in a statement that the test-optional admissions process, which will be rolled out with the class of 2023, is part of an initiative designed to make its undergraduate college more accessible to first-generation and low-income students.
Registering for the tests costs students and their families at least $46. Signing up for essays costs about an extra $15. Students can also retake the tests at their own expense.
James G. Nondorf, the university’s dean of admissions and financial aid, said in a statement that the initiative levels the playing field, allowing low-income students to present themselves “as well as any other applicant.”
“We want students to understand the application does not define you — you define the application,” he said.
The change comes as part of a broader UChicago Empower Initiative that also aims to expand financial aid and other programs and resources to help underrepresented students pursue higher education. [The University of Chicago]
Why it matters:
Dozens of schools across the country have already adopted test-optional policies. Last month, Yale said it would no longer require SAT and ACT essays to admit students, while in 2016, Columbia joined the University of Pennsylvania, becoming the nation’s first two Ivy League schools to drop the SAT’s subjects tests and essay requirements.
The Washington Post reports that colleges and universities that still require the standardized tests use them as a check against high school grades, which can be inflated.
Still, the University of Chicago’s decision may force other institutions that compete for applicants to consider going test-optional, too. Some admissions deans from other schools are already weighing what to do in response to the university’s announcement, the Post reported.
Don Hossler of the University of Southern California’s Rossier School of Education told Inside Higher Ed that “for most schools, their thinking will be along the lines of: ‘I want to be competitive for those students and do not want to be left off of the list of schools students are considering only because we are not test optional.’”

The United Nations warns that recent monsoon rains have threatened the lives of nearly 200,000 Rohingya Muslims living in refugee camps in Bangladesh.
According to the U.N., the storms have caused flooding and landslides in the hilly areas that lack trees, rocks and shrubs to hold back sandy ground. At the same time, strong winds have damaged hundreds of shelters, leaving families exposed to the storms.
At least three people have died in the past week, including a 3-year-old Rohingya boy who was crushed by a mud wall of his shelter.
The U.N. says the storms have shut down roads and several learning centers in the area. The rains could also increase the threat of waterborne diseases such as cholera and diarrhea.
“As the monsoon rains intensify, so do the dangers that children face – not only injury, separation or even death as a result of landslides and flooding, but also disease, and a lack of access to vital services including health and education,” UNICEF Representative in Bangladesh Edouard Beigbeder said in a statement. [Buzzfeed]
Why it matters:
Last year, hundreds of thousands of Rohingya Muslims, religious minorities in the Buddhist-majority Myanmar, fled to neighboring Bangladesh to escape attacks, executions and in some cases rape by the Myanmar military.
The current monsoon season presents yet another challenge for the thousands of families displaced by what’s now considered a humanitarian crisis.
“It’s vital that refugees in the most vulnerable locations are able to move to safer locations, but many families – who have already faced upheavals several times over the last few months — are reluctant to abandon their makeshift homes,” Beigbeder said.
Last month, the UN struck a deal with Myanmar to return hundreds of thousands of Rohingya Muslims to the country. In January, Myanmar and Bangladesh also agreed to complete the repatriation of refugees within two years.
More than eight feet of rain is expected to fall in the area throughout the summer, the UN reports.
NASA’s Mars Exploration Rover Opportunity is shown in this handout photo released to Reuters July 29, 2014.
NASA’s Opportunity rover is weathering a massive dust storm on Mars that has blanketed a quarter of the red planet’s surface since it was first detected on May 30.
The tempest has blotted out the sun, likely forcing the solar-powered rover to effectively go into sleep mode until the storm passes.
NASA said Tuesday it could be several days before the rover receives enough sunlight to recharge itself, but engineers weren’t sure how long the storm would last.
The storm has had a minimal impact on the Curiosity rover, which is currently on the other side of the world. Although the tempest has reached Curiosity’s location, that rover is a nuclear-powered vehicle, so unlike Opportunity, it doesn’t require sunlight to remain operational. [NASA]
Why it matters:
NASA says massive dust storms are infrequent, occurring about once every six to eight Earth years. But when they occur, they can last weeks if not months.
If this storm lasts long enough, there’s a chance the rover could get too cold. This could potentially damage the vehicle and end its 14-year mission. Mars’ extreme cold is what likely ended the mission of NASA’s Spirit rover in 2010.
“We should be able to ride out this storm,” Opportunity project manager John Callas said during a news conference last week. “We’re concerned, but we’re hopeful that the storm will clear and the rover will begin to communicate to us.”

Smartphone security is better than it was when the devices first hit the market. But as we learned in the wake of 2015’s San Bernardino shooting, when the FBI enlisted the help of a forensic firm to unlock the suspect’s iPhone after Apple refused, it isn’t hard for investigators to access devices they need, even those protected by multiple layers of security.
That could change with the release of a new setting — USB Restricted Mode — released by Apple last week.
The iPhone’s new operating system, iOS12, will include a default setting that prevents the device from transmitting information through the USB port — what many firms use to get around passwords and passcodes — after it has been locked for more than an hour. It will become a permanent feature in the company’s next rollout.
This could “cut access by as much as 90 percent,” Reuters reported.
Apple said the goal of the restricted setting wasn’t to block law enforcement — “we have the greatest respect for law enforcement, and we don’t design our security improvements to frustrate their efforts to do their jobs,” it said in a statement. It was intended as a tool for consumers in all countries, particularly those with high crime or without as many personal protections from law enforcement, it noted.
A Justice Department official told Eric Geller of Politico that in light of the change, the “FBI may now be able to claim an exigent need to extract data from seized devices” within an hour and without a warrant. [Reuters]
Why it matters:
The new setting appears to have reignited the running war between tech companies — who have pointed to consumers’ rights in refusing to hand over personal information like passwords or other encryption data — and federal and law enforcement agencies, who say that tech companies’ refusal to help them interferes with investigations and possibly even national security.
Still, it’s not clear how often police actually run into this issue. As recently as January, FBI Director Chris Wray described encrypted smartphones as a “major public safety issue” and implored companies like Apple to help, though an investigation by the Washington Post last month suggested that the government was overstating the problem by several thousand devices.
Fight aside, researchers and federal agents are going to continue to devise new methods of getting into your phone, Reuters writes. The bad news: “Even some of the methods most prized by intelligence agencies have been leaked on the internet,” which means those workarounds could more easily fall into the wrong hands, too."
https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/how-the-toxic-stress-of-family-separation-can-harm-a-child,refugee,1529,2018-06-18T17:46:47-04:00,Laura Santhanam,How the toxic stress of family separation can harm a child,"Federal officials at the U.S.-Mexico border separated nearly 2,000 children from their families between April 19 and May 31. While it’s not clear how the political fight about the practice will play out, researchers do know how a traumatic event like being separated from a parent affects a child.
“Taking children away from their mothers is harmful to them,” said Jack Shonkoff, who directs the Center for the Developing Child at Harvard University and for decades has researched how stress affects the brain. “There’s nothing complicated about that, and there’s incredibly strong science and a big hunk of common sense that both lead us to the same conclusions.”
Children being separated from their parents at the border experience toxic stress — intense, repetitive or prolonged adversity without an adult’s intervention — a situation that’s usually seen when a child is placed in an orphanage, survives a natural disaster or lives in poverty, a war zone or a refugee camp.
This kind of stress can have lifelong impact. Here’s what we know about how toxic stress affects children and what’s happening to those being detained at the border.
When humans and animals feel threatened, their bodies produce stress hormones. This biological response triggers a chain of events that evolved to help us recognize and survive dangerous situations.
First, your amygdala — where fear registers in the brain — fires off signals. Your brain’s hypothalamus sounds the alarm for the rest of your body. Your body’s adrenal glands and tissue, located near your kidneys, release adrenaline –the “fight-or-flight” hormone — along with norepinephrine and cortisol, another stress hormone. With these hormones surging through your body, your heart races, your muscles contract, your breath quickens and your blood pressure rises. Your brain is preparing the body for how to handle trauma, said Nim Tottenham, a psychologist and researcher with the Developmental Affective Neuroscience Lab at Columbia University.
This happens when a child cries because they are hungry or throws a tantrum over a toy. In a stable environment, a familiar adult calms them, which tells their body’s alert system to stand down. In response, the child’s heartbeat slows to its normal pace. They can take a deep breath and relax.
For nearly 2,000 immigrant children removed from their families and held in custody along the U.S. border with Mexico, the person who can flip that off-switch is gone. When Colleen Kraft, the president of the American Academy of Pediatrics, visited a Texas shelter this spring, she said staff were not allowed to touch children. Kraft, a pediatrician with 30 years of experience, said she saw one young girl weeping for her mother. The staff offered toys and books to console the girl, but they told Kraft they were not allowed to hold her.
“We, in this action, are inflicting toxic stress on these children,” she said.
When both children and adults are in a state of toxic stress, the brain and body are fixated on ensuring immediate survival, Tottenham said. But children are especially vulnerable because they are undergoing major brain development, which means survival takes priority over things like academic development and physical growth.
Trauma that children who are separated from their parents and placed in migrant detention centers “has biological consequences on brain development in ways that are enduring for a lifetime,” Tottenham said. There is not one bellwether study that tells us separating children from their families is bad for their brains and development, Shonkoff said — there are “hundreds of studies” produced over several decades that have established the negative longterm consequences of toxic stress on children.
Some of the effects include:
Brain development
In a situation where children are separated from their parents for a long period of time, they remain on high alert, and their bodies endure prolonged and severe toxic stress as a result. That interrupts the brain’s architecture at a critical time of development, when neural circuits — the pathways necessary to carry information to and from the brain — are forming rapidly, at a rate of more than 1 million neural connections each second in infants and toddlers. Stress hormones block those neurons. This can lead to delayed development in reason, learning and emotional development. This stress can overwhelm the hippocampus, the brain’s built-in shutdown valve for the stress hormone cortisol. If continuously exposed to toxic stress over time, damage done to the child’s brain cannot be changed, studies have shown.
Emotional toll
When a child is primed to experience fear and anxiety, those emotions can superimpose themselves onto how the child interacts with another person, even if that person wants to nurture and love the child. This condition is called reactive attachment disorder, and it can start as early as infancy if a child’s basic needs aren’t met by a parent or caregiver, preventing a healthy bond from forming between them. If you try to hug a child diagnosed with this disorder, they may react by biting or hitting you, Kraft said: “Any activity with these children, even if it’s a loving activity, they’re going to react.”
In other words, children with this disorder don’t recognize nurturing behavior and therefore don’t know how to respond– so instead, they perceive these gestures as a possible threat.
People often think that an infant or toddler who experiences trauma won’t remember the fear and anxiety that filled their early years once they’re placed into a stable environment, like a foster home. But “that is absolutely wrong,” Shonkoff said.
Toxic stress is more subtle than a broken bone or distended stomach, but it can leave permanent mark on a child’s brain and can “create a weak foundation for later learning, behavior, and health,” according to a 2012 study published in the journal Pediatrics that explored how adversity and toxic stress in early childhood can manifest itself throughout a child’s life.
After a long period of sustained toxic stress, a child who had seemed inconsolable may become quiet, dull or withdrawn. That doesn’t mean they have adjusted to what’s going on, said Shonkoff, who led the committee that produced the 2012 study. Those symptoms emerge because their cortisol levels are depressed and their stress levels are blunted.
Long-term consequences of toxic stress are as much about physical health as they are about mental health, Shonkoff said. These children are more likely to experience behavioral problems, drop out of school, struggle with substance abuse or be diagnosed with chronic illnesses, such as diabetes or heart disease.
“The bigger danger to children are the long-term consequences, and the longer they’re separated from their mothers, the greater the risks become,” he said.
Pediatricians, including Kraft and Shonkoff, say prevention is the best cure for toxic stress in children — simply put, don’t expose them to trauma in the first place.
Therapy has been designed to combat the effects of toxic stress, but they are often expensive, need to be delivered over time and are not widely available, Kraft said. And as with any medication or therapy, individual children respond to this treatment differently. For some children, play therapy may relieve some symptoms of trauma, but for others, the strategy may not produce any real change no matter how much time is spent trying to find the right treatment.
Time is critical for delivering these services if the goal is to relieve the child from the fear and anxiety gripping them. As soon as they are identified as needing help from trauma, they need to be connected with services, said Kelly Whitener, associate professor of practice of Georgetown University’s Center for Children and Families.
The Department of Health and Human Services did not indicate when asked by the PBS NewsHour whether the federal government’s shelters provide any kind of treatment or therapy to children at-risk for or experiencing toxic stress.
To develop those kind of services would take enormous effort and cost, Shonkoff said. And even if children receive such support, Kraft said, it’s unlikely they would be fully restored mentally, emotionally and physically to who they were before they reached the United States.
Children in detention facilities eventually are placed in a shelter or with a sponsor while they navigate immigration court proceedings. At the same time, they are grappling with multiple levels of separation, Tottenham said. The initial trauma of watching a parent or guardian being taken away is compounded by further trauma of life going on without that person. On top of that, the child is wondering whether they will ever see that parent again.
The Trump administration on Monday continued to defend the separation of children and parents at the border. The House is considering several immigration proposals, some of which address family separation, but it’s unclear at this point whether any of them have enough support.
If the policy ended today, Tottenham said entire families will need therapy and interventions to account for the trauma they have already endured. If that doesn’t happen, a population of children will grow up at great risk of developing behavior and mental health challenges, she said: “They’re going to be living in the United States and know that the U.S. government is the source of this trauma early in life.”"

Democrats have turned up the pressure over the administration policy, and some Republicans have joined the chorus of criticism. Former first lady Laura Bush has called the separation policy “cruel” and “immoral” while GOP Sen. Susan Collins expressed concern about it and a former adviser to Trump questioned using the policy to pressure Democrats on immigration legislation.
Trump continued to cast blame on Democrats Monday, as he detoured from planned remarks on U.S. space policy to defend his administration’s policies. “I say it’s very strongly the Democrats’ fault,” he said at the White House.
“The United States will not be a migrant camp and it will not be a refugee holding facility,” he added. “Not on my watch.”

Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen rejected criticism accusing her department of inhuman and immoral actions.
“We are doing none of those things. We are enforcing the laws passed by Congress,” she said in an appearance before the National Sheriffs’ Association in New Orleans. Like Trump, she called on Congress to reform immigration laws.

Nearly 2,000 children were separated from their families over a six-week period in April and May after Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced a new “zero-tolerance” policy that refers all cases of illegal entry for criminal prosecution. U.S. protocol prohibits detaining children with their parents because the children are not charged with a crime and the parents are.
Nielsen said that releasing parents with their children amounts to a “get out of jail free card” policy for those in the country illegally.
Speaking at the same conference, Sessions echoed Nielsen’s defense of the policy, and called on Congress to act.
“We do not want to separate parents from their children,” Sessions said. “If we build the wall, if we pass legislation to end the lawlessness, we won’t face these terrible choices.”
Trump asserted Monday that children “are being used by some of the worst criminals on earth” as a way to enter the United States. He tweeted: “Has anyone been looking at the Crime taking place south of the border,” calling it “historic.”
Children are being used by some of the worst criminals on earth as a means to enter our country. Has anyone been looking at the Crime taking place south of the border. It is historic, with some countries the most dangerous places in the world. Not going to happen in the U.S.
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 18, 2018
Criticism is rising from both sides of the political aisle. In a guest column for The Washington Post Sunday, Mrs. Bush made some of the strongest comments yet from a Republican.
“I live in a border state. I appreciate the need to enforce and protect our international boundaries, but this zero-tolerance policy is cruel. It is immoral. And it breaks my heart,” she wrote. She compared it to the internment of Japanese-Americans during World War II, which she called “one of the most shameful episodes in U.S. history.”
Underscoring the emotional tension, first lady Melania Trump, who has tended to stay out of contentious policy debates, waded into the issue. Her spokeswoman said that Mrs. Trump believes “we need to be a country that follows all laws,” but also one “that governs with heart.”
“Mrs. Trump hates to see children separated from their families and hopes both sides of the aisle can finally come together to achieve successful immigration reform,” spokeswoman Stephanie Grisham said.
The signs of splintering GOP support are spreading.
The Rev. Franklin Graham, a longtime Trump ally, called the policy “disgraceful.” Several religious groups, including some conservative ones, have pushed to stop the practice of separating immigrant children from their parents.
Former Trump adviser Anthony Scaramucci said Monday on CNN that it “doesn’t feel right” for the Trump administration to blame Democrats and use the issue as a way of pressuring Democrats into negotiating on a Republican immigration bill.
Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine said she favors tighter border security, but expressed deep concerns about the child separation policy.
“What the administration has decided to do is to separate children from their parents to try to send a message that if you cross the border with children, your children are going to be ripped away from you,” she said. “That’s traumatizing to the children who are innocent victims, and it is contrary to our values in this country.”
House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi said the policy “leaves a dark stain on our nation.”
“Ripping vulnerable little children away from their parents is an utter atrocity that debases America’s values and our legacy as a beacon of hope, opportunity and freedom,” she said Monday.
Trump plans to meet with House Republicans on Tuesday to discuss pending immigration legislation amid the election-season debate over what has been one of his favorite issues. The House is expected to vote this week on a bill pushed by conservatives that may not have enough support to pass, and a compromise measure with key proposals supported by the president. The White House has said Trump would sign either one.
Both House proposals face broad opposition from Democrats, and even if a bill does pass, the closely divided Senate seems unlikely to go along.
Trump’s former chief strategist said Republicans would face steep consequences for pushing the compromise bill because it provides a path to citizenship for young “Dreamer” immigrants brought to the country illegally as children. Steve Bannon argued that that effort risks alienating Trump’s political base and could lead to election losses in November, when Republicans hope to preserve their congressional majorities.

Facing rising outrage from some Republicans as well as Democrats over the forced separation of migrant children and parents at the U.S.-Mexico border, President Donald Trump dug in Monday, again falsely blaming Democrats and declaring he would keep the U.S. from becoming “a migrant camp.”
Democrats have turned up the pressure over the administration policy, and some Republicans have joined the chorus of criticism. Former first lady Laura Bush has called the separation policy “cruel” and “immoral” while GOP Sen. Susan Collins expressed concern about it and a former adviser to Trump questioned using the policy to pressure Democrats on immigration legislation.

Trump continued to cast blame on Democrats Monday, as he detoured from planned remarks on U.S. space policy to defend his administration’s policies. “I say it’s very strongly the Democrats’ fault,” he said at the White House.
“The United States will not be a migrant camp and it will not be a refugee holding facility,” he added. “Not on my watch.”
Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen rejected criticism accusing her department of inhuman and immoral actions.
“We are doing none of those things. We are enforcing the laws passed by Congress,” she said in an appearance before the National Sheriffs’ Association in New Orleans. Like Trump, she called on Congress to reform immigration laws.
Nearly 2,000 children were separated from their families over a six-week period in April and May after Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced a new “zero-tolerance” policy that refers all cases of illegal entry for criminal prosecution. U.S. protocol prohibits detaining children with their parents because the children are not charged with a crime and the parents are.

One cage had 20 children inside. Scattered about are bottles of water, bags of chips and large foil sheets intended to serve as blankets.
One teenager told an advocate who visited that she was helping care for a young child she didn’t know because the child’s aunt was somewhere else in the facility. She said she had to show others in her cell how to change the girl’s diaper.
The U.S. Border Patrol on Sunday allowed reporters to briefly visit the facility where it holds families arrested at the southern U.S. border, responding to new criticism and protests over the Trump administration’s “zero tolerance” policy and resulting separation of families.
More than 1,100 people were inside the large, dark facility that’s divided into separate wings for unaccompanied children, adults on their own, and mothers and fathers with children. The cages in each wing open out into common areas to use portable restrooms. The overhead lighting in the warehouse stays on around the clock.

The Border Patrol said close to 200 people inside the facility were minors unaccompanied by a parent. Another 500 were “family units,” parents and children. Many adults who crossed the border without legal permission could be charged with illegal entry and placed in jail, away from their children.
Reporters were not allowed by agents to interview any of the detainees or take photos.
Nearly 2,000 children have been taken from their parents since Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced the policy, which directs Homeland Security officials to refer all cases of illegal entry into the United States for prosecution. Church groups and human rights advocates have sharply criticized the policy, calling it inhumane.
Stories have spread of children being torn from their parents’ arms, and parents not being able to find where their kids have gone. A group of congressional lawmakers visited the same facility Sunday and were set to visit a longer-term shelter holding around 1,500 children — many of whom were separated from their parents.
“Those kids inside who have been separated from their parents are already being traumatized,” said Democratic Sen. Jeff Merkley of Oregon, who was denied entry earlier this month to children’s shelter. “It doesn’t matter whether the floor is swept and the bedsheets tucked in tight.”
In Texas’ Rio Grande Valley, the busiest corridor for people trying to enter the U.S., Border Patrol officials argue that they have to crack down on migrants and separate adults from children as a deterrent to others.
“When you exempt a group of people from the law … that creates a draw,” said Manuel Padilla, the Border Patrol’s chief agent here. “That creates the trends right here.”
Agents running the holding facility — generally known as “Ursula” for the name of the street it’s on — said everyone detained is given adequate food, access to showers and laundered clothes, and medical care. People are supposed to move through the facility quickly. Under U.S. law, children are required to be turned over within three days to shelters funded by the Department of Health and Human Services.
Padilla said agents in the Rio Grande Valley have allowed families with children under the age of 5 to stay together in most cases.
An advocate who spent several hours in the facility Friday said she was deeply troubled by what she found.
Michelle Brane, director of migrant rights at the Women’s Refugee Commission, met with a 16-year-old girl who had been taking care of a young girl for three days. The teen and others in their cage thought the girl was 2 years old.
“She had to teach other kids in the cell to change her diaper,” Brane said.
Brane said that after an attorney started to ask questions, agents found the girl’s aunt and reunited the two. It turned out that the girl was actually 4 years old. Part of the problem was that she didn’t speak Spanish, but K’iche, a language indigenous to Guatemala.
“She was so traumatized that she wasn’t talking,” Brane said. “She was just curled up in a little ball.”
Brane said she also saw officials at the facility scold a group of 5-year-olds for playing around in their cage, telling them to settle down. There are no toys or books.
But one boy nearby wasn’t playing with the rest. According to Brane, he was quiet, clutching a piece of paper that was a photocopy of his mother’s ID card.
“The government is literally taking kids away from their parents and leaving them in inappropriate conditions,” Brane said. “If a parent left a child in a cage with no supervision with other 5-year-olds, they’d be held accountable.”
Dr. Colleen Kraft, the head of the American Academy of Pediatrics, said that she visited a small shelter in Texas recently, which she declined to identity. A toddler inside the 60-bed facility caught her eye — she was crying uncontrollably and pounding her little fists on mat.
Staff members tried to console the child, who looked to be about 2 years old, Kraft said. She had been taken from her mother the night before and brought to the shelter.
The staff gave her books and toys — but they weren’t allowed to pick her up, to hold her or hug her to try to calm her. As a rule, staff aren’t allowed to touch the children there, she said.
“The stress is overwhelming,” she said. “The focus needs to be on the welfare of these children, absent of politics.”

In unison, the crowd followed Rocketto’s lead, chanting, “Niños, no estan solos” and “you are not alone.”
As families around the country celebrated Father’s Day, immigration activists in Texas on Sunday held a march and vigil to draw attention to recent separations of immigrant children from their parents at the U.S.-Mexico border.
In McAllen, organizers estimated about 200 people attended a vigil to raise awareness about the Trump administration’s recent policy to separate families, one that has gained bipartisan condemnation.

The facility and others made headlines last week after CNN reported that a Honduran mother’s child had been forcibly taken away while breastfeeding, which the Department of Homeland Security denies. Other border facilities holding immigrant children have also gained attention, including one in Brownsville along the U.S.-Mexico border, where a former Walmart currently houses almost 1,500 immigrant children.

The choice to call the demonstration a “vigil” was meant to “highlight the life and death implications” of family separation, said Ai-jen Poo, executive director of the National Domestic Workers Alliance, which helped organize the event and another protest outside a detention center in Elizabeth, New Jersey.

Poo referenced outrage at family separation from the medical community, whose leaders have pointed to its negative effects on children’s health. American Academy of Pediatrics President Colleen Kraft told BuzzFeed News on Friday that this separation can “cause irreparable harm to lifelong development by disrupting a child’s brain architecture.”
Poo also mentioned Marco Antonio Muñoz, a 39-year-old Honduran father who killed himself in a Texas jail last month after immigration officials separated him from his family, the Washington Post reported.

“There are people whose lives are at stake and children’s, whose entire well-being and future is at stake. And I think we want to remember Marco Muñoz and the many many fathers who are on the front lines of this administration’s policies as well as the children,” Poo said.
The demonstration was sponsored by the Families Belong Together coalition, a group of organizations advocating for immigrant rights that includes the National Domestic Workers Alliance, the American Civil Liberties Union, People’s Action, United We Dream, America’s Voice, the Women’s Refugee Commission and Faith in Action.
Children in attendance brought gifts they hoped to deliver to other children inside the facility. Former U.S. Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Julian Castro accompanied a young girl named Leah from Florida, whose father is undocumented, as they approached the facility holding stuffed animals and letters. Denied entry, Castro and the young girl left the colorful construction paper cards and toys on the ground at the door.
Hundreds of people also marched to Tornillo, Texas, where a tent encampment for immigrant children is being constructed. Estimates provided by the office of Texas state Rep. César Blanco (D-El Paso) to the Texas Tribune indicate that approximately 100 children were living there as of Friday, though the site could hold up to 360 children. Rep. Beto O’Rourke, D-Texas. who is now running for Senate, and Veronica Escobar, who is running for his seat in the House, organized the march along with the Latino Victory Project.
The march began at the Tornillo-Guadalupe Toll Plaza around 10:30 am ET as people arrived in long caravans of cars. Linking arms, marchers walked by the “tent city,” less than two miles from the U.S.-Mexico border. Massachusetts Rep. Joe Kennedy was also present.

Demonstrators held waved American flags, raised cameras, and lifted signs as umbrellas and wide-brimmed straw hats shielded protesters from the cloudless morning. Organizers chanted, “When I say family, you say unity,” “free our children now,” and “families united.”
Activism against the Trump administration’s immigration policies has increased in recent months. Separating families at the border is not mandated by law, but ramped up under a new “zero tolerance” policy on border crossings that Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced in May. The policy mandates that all adults who cross the U.S. border outside of official ports of entry face criminal prosecution. The White House maintains that the Trump administration is enforcing current laws.
While Sessions’ announcement occurred only a month ago, a Reuters report revealed earlier this month that nearly 1,800 families were separated between October 2016 and February 2018, indicating that this enforcement procedure may have been installed earlier. Department of Homeland Security officials confirmed Friday that an additional 1,995 children were taken from 1,940 adults at the U.S.-Mexico border from April 19 to May 31.
“Families belong together” has become the identifiable rallying cry of immigration activists who call family separation cruel and inhumane.
Referencing a “constant awakening” around immigration policy in the U.S., George Goehl, the executive director of People’s Action, remarked on the the diversity of those traveling to the vigil. “People from all walks of life and all kinds of immigration histories are moved to act in this moment,” not just “recent immigrants,” he said.
Multiple organizers said their own experiences as parents influenced their involvement in the border demonstrations.
Cristóbal Alex, president of the Latino Victory Project, said his sadness at being away from his daughter on Father’s Day is a “short-lived” feeling. But, “For parents of the children that are held in detention camps like the one that we’re marching on in Tornillo, there’s really no end in sight,” he said."

After his mother died of starvation, and with his father living in China, Ryu survived by begging strangers for food or a place to sleep.
Now 23 years old and living in the U.S., Ryu and other North Korean defectors say the historic meeting between President Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un was an unprecedented opportunity to address the egregious human rights abuses in their home country. But after Trump and Kim released their joint statement, Ryu and others were disappointed and offended that human rights didn’t play a central role in the talks.
“Why are they meeting, if they’re not going to talk about human rights?” Ryu said. “Why do they want to meet if they’re not going to solve anything? It was not successful. It was political bullsh*t. It was just an opportunity to take a photo.”
Ryu escaped North Korea twice before turning 17. The first time, his Chinese stepbrother smuggled him out of the country, taking him to their father in China. But after one of his father’s neighbors reported his escape, he was captured and sent to one of North Korea’s prison labor camps. Human Rights Watch reports that between 80,000 and 120,000 people are currently imprisoned in the camps.
He was discharged from the labor camp nine months later after almost dying of malnourishment. Ryu said he worked 18 hours per day in the camp, with a daily food ration of 150 kernels of corn.
Ryu then found a job working in a coal mine in exchange for rice to eat. After a year there, he attempted escape again. He swam the river to China, and started walking to his father’s house, but passed out in the road on the way there from dehydration and exhaustion. This time, he was found by a Chinese man sympathetic to his cause, who connected him to a South Korean missionary, gave him food, water and medicine, and bought him a bus ticket for the 18-hour ride to his father’s house.
In 2012, he received refugee status, which allowed him to come to the U.S., and he was placed with a foster family in California. Now, he works as an advocacy intern at Liberty in North Korea, a nonprofit that helps North Korean refugees escape and get settled. From constantly monitoring changing safe routes through China and Southeast Asia, to cultivating a network of relationships with people on the ground to safely transport refugees, to providing resettlement funds, they work to ensure escapees won’t be saddled with crippling debt after paying a broker to escape.
Many experts and North Korean advocates were surprised that human rights didn’t appear in the leaders’ joint statement, especially because Trump has referenced the topic in the past, including at his first State of the Union, when the president hosted defector Ji Seong-ho. When Trump shared Ji Seong-ho’s story, he called Kim Jong Un’s regime a “cruel dictatorship.” In February, the President met with North Korean defectors at the White House to hear their stories, too.
But since the summit, Trump has changed his tone, telling ABC’s George Stephanopoulos that “his country does love him. His people, you see the fervor. They have great fervor.”
He also softened his language on the conditions in North Korea. At a press conference following the summit, Trump said that human rights abuses happen “in a lot of places” around the world, and that Kim was a “tough” leader.
Trump raised the issue of human rights in summit meetings with Kim, according to a State Department official who did not provide further details on what they discussed.
The U.S. has attempted to address the human rights conditions in North Korea before. Madeleine Albright, Secretary of State to former President Bill Clinton, traveled to Pyongyang in 2000 to meet with Kim Jong Il in hopes of brokering a deal to end the country’s nuclear program in exchange for billions of dollars in aid for food, fuel and infrastructure development. The deal ultimately fell apart, and many later called the meeting a propaganda victory for North Korea.
Yeonmi Park, another North Korean defector living in New York City, said the Trump-Kim summit was a wasted opportunity to negotiate better conditions for North Koreans.
“Trump has term limits, Kim does not,” she said. “What’s going to happen when he [Trump] goes out of office? Are we going to have another ‘peace talk’? Kim will start testing weapons again, and nothing will have changed for North Korean people.”
An outspoken activist for North Korean human rights, Park, 24, garnered international attention for her lecture at the 2014 One Young World summit in which she recounted her escape from North Korea in 2007, sharing that she watched a Chinese broker rape her mother and that they walked through the Gobi desert in Mongolia, eventually reaching South Korea in 2009. The video went viral on social media and currently has almost 4 million views on YouTube.

Park said that before the summit, she saw America as a beacon of hope.
“It’s so heartbreaking to see America appreciating this dictator,” she said. “This is the leader of the free world! I feel less safe, living here. … Will I be deported if America and North Korea become allies? It keeps me awake at night. What will I tell my son?”
Jinhye Jo, 30, escaped North Korea with her sister and mother in 2008, after six of her other family members died of starvation or other causes related to the regime. They escaped to China, where they lived in hiding and attended a nearby Christian school taught by a Korean-American pastor named Yo-Han Yoon. When they were captured and sent back to North Korean prison, Yoon fundraised $10,000 for their release, and they were able to come to the U.S. as refugees.
Jo founded the nonprofit North Korean Refugees in the United States, which helps facilitate the escape and resettlement of North Koreans in America. She says she’s supported Trump in the past because “he’s a Christian,” but was hurt by his approach to Kim.
“I was really shocked. I’m a citizen of the U.S. right now. And I’m trying to get people to come to this country,” she said. “But if Trump becomes friends with Kim, where do I have to go? Where can my people go?”
Still, Ryu and other advocates like him hope the meeting signals better communication between his native country and his new country going forward. Ryu thinks open communication between North Korea and the rest of the world will eventually help improve human rights conditions, because they could lead to expanded trade and economic growth down the road.
“I stand with the North Korean people, no matter what,” he said. “I just want things to improve for them.”"

White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said “it is very biblical to enforce the law.” Attorney General Jeff Sessions had earlier cited the Bible in his defense of the border policy that has resulted in hundreds of children being separated from their parents.
Since the Trump administration rolled out its “zero-tolerance” border protection policy, separation of parents from their children has become a more routine part of the process. Reporters pressed the White House's Sarah Sanders on this today.

The comments came as House Speaker Paul Ryan and other Republicans said they were not comfortable with family separations, which spiked dramatically after the Justice Department adopted a policy in April of referring all illegal border crossers for prosecution.
“We don’t want kids to be separated from their parents,” Ryan said Thursday.
Sen. James Lankford, R-Okla., tweeted Thursday that he told a constituent that, “I am asking the White House to keep families together as much as we can.”

In an unusually tense series of exchanges in the White House briefing room, Sanders blamed Democrats for the policy separating children from parents and wrongly insisted the administration had made no changes increasing the tactics’ use.
“The separation of illegal alien families is the product of the same legal loopholes that Democrats refuse to close and these laws are the same that have been on the books for over a decade, and the president is simply enforcing them,” she said.
Ryan and other GOP lawmakers said they are seeking to resolve the problem in a compromise immigration bill. A draft of that bill released Thursday would keep children with their families while they are in Homeland Security Department custody.
Ryan claimed Thursday that the family-separation policy is being dictated by a court ruling that prevents children who enter the country illegally from being held in custody for long periods.
But House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi pushed back on that assessment, saying that President Donald Trump could “stop the practice on a dime.”
She called the Trump administration’s separation policy “barbaric,” adding: “It has to stop.”
The family separations are occurring as a result of the Trump administration’s “zero tolerance” policy for those entering the country illegally. Under the directive, families crossing the border are routinely referred for criminal prosecution. Previously, families were often sent to civil deportation proceedings, which allow children to remain with their parents.
READ MORE: How Trump’s family separation policy has become what it is today
During the criminal proceedings, the children are usually released to other family members or foster care.
Rep. Kevin Yoder, R-Kan., said he’s “heartbroken” by the separations and is working to find a solution to keep families together. His comments were in response to a letter from local officials urging him to demand that the Department of Homeland Security end the practice.
“As a father to two young girls it is unimaginable what these parents are suffering,” Yoder said.
With horror stories of babies and young children being taken from their mothers receiving heavy news coverage, the White House sought to shift the narrative by providing some media groups with a tour of a former Wal-Mart near the border in Texas that houses several hundred immigrant children.
The tour was tightly controlled and the Health and Human Services Department did not allow any photographs or video or interviews, instead releasing a government-produced video of the shelter.
The Associated Press declined to participate in the tour, which came after a Democratic senator tried to enter a federal facility in Texas where immigrant children are being held. Police were called and Sen. Jeff Merkley of Oregon was told to leave.
Merkley said he was able to enter another facility used for processing migrants and run by the Department of Homeland Security. He said he saw men, women and children crowded in cages.
“It reminds me a little bit of a dog kennel, constructed of cyclone fencing,” Merkley said.
The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops also weighed in, saying U.S. officials have discretion to keep families intact. “Separating babies from their mothers is not the answer and is immoral,” said Cardinal Daniel DiNardo, president of the bishops group.
The cardinal’s rebuke is what drew the response from Sessions, who insists the policy of separating families is necessary to deter illegal border-crossings.
Historically, immigrants without serious criminal records have been released from custody while they pursued asylum or refugee status. The Trump administration has moved to detain more people, including asylum seekers.
Lawmakers are considering several ideas to prevent family separations, though it remains to be seen if any proposal can garner enough support to pass.
If Republicans really wanted to tackle the issue of separating families, they could bring a bill to the House floor on an expedited basis, Pelosi said, adding that she sees no prospect for a legislative fix in the Republican-controlled Congress in an election year.
Ryan, R-Wis., said the House would vote next week on two competing immigration measures, but said he “won’t guarantee passage.”
He said Trump backs the GOP efforts to find a compromise.

A day after President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un held their summit in Singapore, is it clearer whether Moon Jae-in played a positive or negative role? A quick answer: Probably not.
Assessments of Moon’s diplomacy have become more divisive and complex, with Trump criticized in both South Korea and the U.S. for the concessions he made to North Korea, while others believe the summit will successfully prolong the current mood of detente.
Meeting for about five hours, Trump and Kim exchanged an historic handshake, took a short stroll together, patted each other’s backs and signed a summit agreement. Trump promised to provide security guarantees to the North and suspend joint military drills with the South as long as negotiations with the North continue in “good faith.” Kim, in return, agreed to work toward a vague “complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.”
Those moves were unthinkable even several months ago, when the two unpredictable leaders threatened to nuke each other and traded a series of harsh personal insults.
Moon issued a statement after the summit calling it a “huge step forward” toward peace that “helped break down the last remaining Cold War legacy on Earth.”

He acknowledged that many difficulties are likely to lie ahead but vowed to work together with the U.S., North Korea and others to bring lasting peace to the Korean Peninsula.
“We will never go back to the past again and never give up on this bold journey. History is a record of people who take action and rise to a challenge,” he said.
But conservatives in South Korea slammed the summit, saying it failed to curb North Korea’s nuclear ambitions. They said both Trump and Moon should be blamed for not specifying steps and deadlines for North Korea’s nuclear disarmament, allowing it time to perfect its weapons program.
“High expectations were met by low results,” said Nam Sung-wook, a North Korea expert at Seoul’s Korea University. “Moon, and then Trump, were quick to bite on North Korea’s invitation for talks. When Trump realized there wasn’t going to be anything substantial in return, it was impossible for him to back out because he had already gone too far.”

U.S. officials had worked hard to get North Korea to agree to “complete, verifiable and irreversible” disarmament, and said they would not offer any major concessions until it took meaningful steps. Despite those efforts, Trump announced after the summit that he had agreed to suspend U.S. military drills with South Korea, something North Korea has long demanded.
On Wednesday, North Korean state media said Trump had also agreed to the North’s desire for a step-by-step disarmament process with corresponding U.S. concessions at each step, rather than immediate disarmament as the U.S. had initially sought.
Trump’s agreement to suspend the military drills apparently came without prior consultation with South Korea, baffling many who believe the U.S.-South Korea alliance, forged in blood during the 1950-53 Korean War, should remain strong throughout the push for a negotiated end to the nuclear tensions.
“Why did South Korea and the U.S. form an alliance and stage military drills before the nuclear crisis flared? It’s because North Korea has been belligerent,” said Kim Taewoo, former president of the Korea Institute for National Unification in Seoul. He said cancellation of the drills “is really a bad idea … and (Trump) betrayed our people.”
Asked to respond to Trump’s decision, Moon spokesman Kim Eui-kyeom said the allies must consider a “variety of ways to further facilitate dialogue” during the nuclear negotiations. He said South Korea is still trying to figure out the exact meaning and intent of Trump’s comments.
Since taking office in May last year, Moon, a son of North Korean refugees, has sought to take the lead in diplomatic efforts to end the North Korean nuclear standoff, which had been dominated by world powers including the U.S. and China.
Provocative nuclear and missile tests by North Korea last year initially gave Moon little diplomatic room to maneuver. But he kept trying to reach out to North Korea, and eventually found a role as a mediator after Kim offered in January to send a delegation to the South Korean Winter Olympics.
After successful cooperation at the Olympics, Moon sent special envoys to North Korea who later traveled to Washington with Kim’s proposal for a summit with Trump. Moon held talks with Kim in April at which Kim agreed to work toward “complete denuclearization.” He met Kim again in May when Trump said he was withdrawing from the planned summit with Kim — a decision Trump quickly reversed.
Experts now expect a temporary peace to continue since North Korea has probably won what it wanted from Tuesday’s summit and Trump is unlikely to back down from summit deals that he wants to portray as a diplomatic triumph.
Analyst Hong Min at Seoul’s Korea Institute for National Unification said critics of the joint statement signed by Trump and Kim are missing a bigger point.
He said it’s meaningful in itself that the leaders of the United States and North Korea met, talked and signed an agreement that will carry more weight and significance than any pact previously made between the wartime foes. The agreement’s aspirational language on denuclearization was a “strategic decision” to reduce pressure on both sides and keep the process going, Hong said.
Trump and Kim agreed that their countries will quickly engage in follow-up talks led by U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and a “relevant high-level” North Korean official.
Bong Youngshik, a professor at Seoul’s Yonsei University, said it’s too early to predict how Trump’s cancellation of the military drills will play out in future nuclear negotiations. He said North Korea is likely to consider Trump’s decision a temporary measure while it remains in negotiations with Washington.
Moon may not face any immediate serious political repercussions at home since North Korea will likely take gradual steps toward disarmament to prevent others from thinking it reneged on its pledge. But if Trump seeks re-election in 2020, his government is likely to apply more pressure on North Korea to make substantial progress in denuclearization, which could bring the nuclear issue to another critical point, said Shin Beomchul of Seoul’s Asan Institute for Policy Studies.
Kim Tong-hyung reported from Seoul, South Korea.

We take a moment every week to bring you important stories beyond the White House and the Capitol. Here’s what we’re reading now.

Designer Kate Spade and chef Anthony Bourdain died by suicide last week.
The two high-profile deaths came the same week as a new report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which says suicide rates have been climbing for more than 15 years in nearly every state in the U.S. Some of the largest increases happened in the Midwest, the CDC said. Nevada was the only state that didn’t see suicide rates rise.
Nearly 45,000 Americans died by suicide in 2016; it’s currently the 10th leading cause of death in the U.S., according to the CDC. More than half of people who killed themselves did not have a known mental health condition at the time of their deaths, the CDC noted.
PBS NewsHour’s Amna Nawaz talks with Dr. Liza Gold about risks, treatment and the scope of the problem.
About 50 percent of all suicides are firearms, Dr. Liza Gold also pointed out on the PBS NewsHour last week. Access to firearms could be a major risk factor, The New York Times reported; states with the strictest gun laws have lower suicide rates. [CDC]
Why it matters: Though high-profile suicides made news this week, climbing suicide rates are affecting all parts of the country, including many rural areas, where low wages and poverty can contribute to the problem. Rural areas have historically been flagged with suicide rates higher than their urban counterparts, according to the CDC.
The CDC found that more than 83 percent of people who died by suicide are white. Of those, nearly 77 percent are male. But “suicide isn’t just a ‘white people thing,'”, sociologist and criminologist Kimya N. Dennis wrote for The Conversation. “People in [African-American] culture, as well as Hispanic, Asian and American Indian communities, are less likely to acknowledge the possibility of having a health condition or seek mental health services,” she writes, which has led to incomplete data from these communities as well as an “one size fits all” approach from the mental health community that doesn’t always address the cultural differences at hand.

Migrants are rescued by staff members of the MV Aquarius, a search and rescue ship run in partnership between SOS Mediterranee and Medecins Sans Frontieres in the central Mediterranean Sea. Karpov/handout via REUTERS.
Last week, 629 migrants were rescued off the Libyan coast by the Italian coast guard. But the incident set off a spat over who would take them in.
Matteo Salvini, the leader of the Italy’s far-right party, refused to let the migrants into the country, and instead asked Malta to take in the migrants. Maltese Prime Minister Joseph Muscat said that was not his country’s responsibility because it had no role in the rescue, adding “Italy broke international rules and caused a standoff.”
Finally, Spain announced it will allow the rescue boat to dock with the migrants in Valencia. And newly-elected Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez also said Spain will allow the migrants to remain in the country.
Still, it is unclear how or when the ship will dock in Valencia. The ship is about 750 nautical miles from the port. [The Guardian]
Why it matters: Italy’s new populist leaders were sworn into office June 1, after campaigning on hardline anti-immigrant and anti-European Union sentiments. Some had previously called to ditch the Euro, or even leave the EU, Brexit-style. During monthslong negotiations to form the new government, the leaders gave up on those demands, but remained adamant in their plans to strictly limit African migrants. According to UN estimates, more than 600,000 African migrants have sought asylum in Italy since 2014.
“Italy will also start to say no to human trafficking, no to the business of illegal immigration,” Italian Interior Minister Matteo Salvini said Sunday.
The rhetoric of the new right-wing Italian government has concerned EU leaders, as has the populist trend sweeping across Europe in recent elections.
In December, 31-year-old Sebastian Kurz was elected Austrian Chancellor after running on an anti-immigrant platform and calling for a limit on the number of refugees admitted into the country. Alternative for Germany, or AfD a right-wing German party, made significant electoral strides last September. The party gained seats in the German parliament for the first time, making it the third-largest party in the coalition government. Supporters of the party cited opposition the the number of refugees allowed by the government, led by Chancellor Angela Merkel.
President of the European Commission Donald Tusk congratulated Italy’s new leaders after they were sworn in this month, but also emphasized the importance of “unity and solidarity” among EU members.
The Florida Office of the Inspector General found that for more than a year, the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services, which conducts background checks for gun purchases, failed to use a national database that retains information about criminal backgrounds from all 50 states. REUTERS/Jim Young.
For more than a year, the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services, which conducts background checks for gun purchases, failed to use a national database that retains information about criminal backgrounds from all 50 states, according to the Florida Office of Inspector General. Those findings were first reported by the Tampa Bay Times last week, in an investigation that suggests employees failed to use the National Instant Criminal Background Check System because “the employee in charge of the background checks could not log into the system.”
Agriculture Commissioner Adam Putnam was in charge of the background check program, and made an effort to speed up the process since he was elected to the position in 2010. During the period in which the NICS system was not in use, the state received unprecedented numbers of permit applications. According to the Tampa Bay Times, 268,000 applications for permits were approved and 6,470 were denied during the year the system was not in use, for incomplete applications or state ineligibility. Today, 1.8 million people across the state have concealed weapon permits. [The Tampa Bay Times]
Why it matters: The lapse in using NICS information coincides with major mass shootings in Florida. It also comes with the rise of Putnam’s political ambitions, and the scandal threatens to derail his gubernatorial bid.
Previous reports indicate Omar Mateen, who opened fired on the Pulse Nightclub in Orlando in June 2016, legally purchased his gun from a federally licensed firearms dealer. The man who sold the weapons to Mateen told news outlets after the shooting that Mateen had passed his background check.
Though the system was working in February 2018 at the time of the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, survivors and gun control advocates partly blamed the massacre on lax gun laws in the state, and pushed for greater restrictions. In March, Republican Governor Rick Scott signed a law that increased the age to buy a gun to 21, and enacted a three-day waiting period.
Putnam has highlighted his accomplishments on expediting gun permits in his gubernatorial campaign. But Democratic candidates have quickly jumped on the issue, many calling for him to drop out of the race. On Friday, Putnam put out a statement calling the employee in charge of the background checks “both deceitful and negligent,” adding that the Agricultural Department “immediately launched an investigation and implemented safeguards to ensure this never happens again.”

A Washington Post report last week put a spotlight on the lack of dentists in rural America. The story cites a National Rural Health Association report that found of the country’s 62 million rural U.S. Americans, nearly 43 percent don’t have access to dental care. And there aren’t enough practicing dentists, either, particularly in West Virginia, the Post reported.
The problem is compounded by the state’s apparent inability to prevent a “revolving door” of dentist professionals who are cycled in and out of the state. Despite the state’s efforts to lure dentists into the area with a loan-assistance program for a couple of years, many do not stay past the two-year obligation, the Post reported. [The Washington Post]
Why it matters: Even if West Virginia was able to overturn scarcity concerns with dentists in the state, that’s only half the problem.
“Affordability is the big thing,” Richard Meckstroth of West Virginia University told the newspaper. The Post also points to a report from the American Dental Association’s Health Policy Institute, which found in 2008 that nearly 20 percent of adults between the ages of 21 and 64 did not get dental care in the past year. “Could not afford/no insurance” was the top reason why.

On June 14, 2017, a fire that began inside a 24-story public housing unit in London’s North Kensington neighborhood quickly spiraled out of control, killing 72 people and injuring 70 others.
Nearly a year later, a government-led independent inquiry has started to collect testimony about what happened that night and who is responsible.
There were just less than 300 people living in the building at the time of the fire. About half of those people were killed or injured. Details shared in hearings last week suggest the problems began with structural issues, as detailed by the Washington Post: “doors to each apartment were not fireproofed as they should have been. Emergency overrides for elevators stopped working. Ventilation systems did not do their job. There was no intercom to alert residents. There were no sprinklers.”
The building was recovered with a new material in 2016, but it was flammable, experts said, which likely helped the fire spread more easily. And first responders ordered residents to stay inside, delaying evacuation by 1.5 hours and giving fewer people a chance of survival, testimony revealed. [The Washington Post]
Why it matters: An investigation of this scale is rare in Britain, the Post reports. So far, the inquiry has collected more than 1,100 witness statements and has involved close to 400 companies, the BBC reported.

The outcome of the inquiry, expected this fall, will determine whether civil or criminal charges are filed. It’s also raised new questions about the quality of public housing and how well officials enforce building standards. More than 200 buildings in London are wrapped with the same kind of material as Grenfell, so any changes to building code could force renovations or closures of those structures, too.
Prime Minister Theresa May said ahead of memorials planned this week that it was “clear the response was not good enough.” More than 200 families needed new housing after the fire, but six months after the fire, only 42 had been placed in new accommodations, the BBC found — a much slower timeline than the three-week window May had promised.
May said she also regretted her personal response to the fire; many local residents criticized her for not meeting directly with survivors in the days following the disaster.
“The residents of Grenfell Tower needed to know that those in power recognized and understood their despair … And I will always regret that by not meeting them that day, it seemed as though I didn’t care.”"
https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/migrant-boat-low-on-food-as-italy-malta-standoff-escalates,refugee,1071,2018-06-11T10:29:20-04:00,"Nicole Winfield, Associated Press",Spain offers to take in migrant ship amid Italy-Malta standoff,"ROME — Spain stepped up Monday and offered to take in a rescue ship carrying more than 600 migrants after Italy and Malta refused. The diplomatic standoff had left the migrants stranded at sea and revealed the brass-knuckled negotiating tactics of Italy’s new anti-immigrant government.
Italy and Malta immediately thanked Spain’s new Socialist prime minister for the offer to receive the SOS Mediterranee rescue ship Aquarius at the port of Valencia. But it wasn’t immediately clear if such a voyage was feasible given the distances involved — the ship is now more than 1,400 kilometers (over 750 nautical miles) from Valencia.
The Aquarius said it had received no instructions yet to head to Spain.
The U.N. refugee agency, the European Union, Germany and humanitarian groups had all demanded that the Mediterranean countries put their domestic politics aside and urgently consider the plight of the rescued migrants, which included children, pregnant women and people suffering from hypothermia.
“The duty of a democratic government is not to look away” in a humanitarian crisis, said Barcelona Mayor Ada Colau, who also offered her port as a potential solution to the standoff.
Doctors Without Borders, which has staff aboard the Aquarius, said the rescued migrants were stable for now but that food and water on the ship would run out by Monday night. It said some of the passengers were suffering from water in their lungs as well as chemical burns caused when gasoline mixes with seawater. Seven are pregnant.

But Italy and Malta held firm despite the heavy diplomatic pressure, with Italy’s new interior minister, Matteo Salvini, clearly using the high seas drama as a pretext to force the hand of Italy’s European neighbors. Italy has long demanded that the EU change its migration policy and make good on promises to accept more refugees, saying that Italy has been left alone to coordinate rescues and accept tens of thousands of migrants a year for asylum processing.
“Enough!” Salvini said Monday. “Saving lives is a duty, but transforming Italy into an enormous refugee camp isn’t.”

— Matteo Salvini (@matteosalvinimi) June 11, 2018
He tweeted: #Chiudiamoiporti. “We’re closing the ports.”
The migrants had been rescued from flimsy smugglers’ boats in the Mediterranean during a series of operations Saturday by Italian maritime ships, cargo vessels and the Aquarius itself. All passengers were offloaded to the Aquarius to be taken to land.
Italy claimed that Malta should accept the Aquarius because Malta was the safest, closest port to the ship. Malta said Italy coordinated the rescues and that it has had nothing to do with it.
Maltese Premier Joseph Muscat accused Italy of violating international norms governing sea rescues and said its stance risked “creating a dangerous situation for all those involved.”
Spain’s new Socialist prime minister, Pedro Sanchez, ordered authorities in Valencia to open the port, saying “it’s our duty to avoid a humanitarian catastrophe and offer a secure port for these people.”
But it wasn’t clear if the offer would be taken up given that the trip would expose the migrants to several days more on the sea.
Still, both Muscat and new Italian Premier Giuseppe Conte readily thanked Spain for the offer, with Conte saying “it goes in the direction of solidarity.”
As the rhetoric intensified, the Aquarius remained on standby in the Mediterranean Sea with its 629 passengers, including 123 unaccompanied minors. The ship said it had been ordered by Italy’s coast guard late Sunday to remain 35 miles off Italy and 27 miles from Malta, and there it remained Monday.
Despite the firm “no” from Italy’s national government, several Italian mayors offered to let the ship dock in their ports, including the left-leaning or centrist mayors of Naples, Reggio Calabria and Crotone.
A doctor on the ship, Dr. David Beversluis, said there were no medical emergencies onboard but one passenger had to be revived after he was rescued.
“When the boat broke, a man sank in front of the eyes of the rescuers, who managed to catch him and revive him once out of the water. He is now out of danger,” Beversluis said. “All the survivors are exhausted and dehydrated because they spent many hours adrift in these boats.”
Almost a quarter of the migrant survivors hail from Sudan, the group said.
Doctors Without Borders tweeted a video of some of the women aboard the ship praying Monday morning, saying they were unaware of the diplomatic fight being waged over their fate.
“Thank you Lord,” the women sang.
The standoff marked the first inevitable clash over migrant policy with League leader Salvini, who is now running Italy’s Interior Ministry. Salvini campaigned on an anti-immigrant platform that included a vow to expel hundreds of thousands of migrants already in Italy, even though experts doubt such mass deportations are feasible or financially viable.
Malta, for its part, has consistently refused to take in migrants, citing its small size and limited capacities. The island nation has reduced the number of migrants it has taken in over the past decade, from a high of 2,775 in 2008 to just 23 last year, according to U.N. statistics.
Salvini pointed to Malta’s unwillingness to help in accusing Europe as a whole of leaving Italy on its own to deal with the refugee crisis. He noted that other European countries are very much involved in migrant rescue operations in the Mediterranean — including a German aid group currently off the coast Libya — but no country is stepping up to actually take in the migrants once they are plucked from boats or the sea.
“Italy has stopped bowing our heads and obeying,” Salvini said in a Facebook post. “This time we say no.”
The standoff is actually the third migrant dispute in recent weeks, after Italy’s outgoing government refused to let humanitarian aid groups dock in Italian ports until the ships’ flag nations had formally requested permission. Those incidents delayed the migrants’ arrival, but they ultimately made it to Italy.

At least 413 Palestinians were wounded, including 80 by live fire, Gaza health officials said.
Seven of the wounded were in serious condition, the Health Ministry said, in the latest in a series of mass protests to call attention to a decade-old blockade of Gaza by Israel and Egypt.
The march also marked the annual “Jerusalem Day,” instituted by Iran to protest Israeli rule of the holy city. Israel and Iran have been archenemies since Tehran’s 1979 Islamic Revolution.
In the capitals of Iran and Iraq, thousands of Shiite Muslims marked Jerusalem Day with protests, with some chanting “Death to Israel” or burning Israeli flags and effigies of President Donald Trump.
In Gaza, at least 115 Palestinians had been killed and nearly 3,800 wounded by Israeli army fire in previous protests near the border fence. The overwhelming majority of the dead and wounded had been unarmed, according to Gaza health officials.
After Muslim prayers at noon Friday, thousands of Gaza residents streamed toward five protest tent camps that had been erected more than two months ago, each several hundred meters from the fence. From there, smaller groups walked closer to it.
In a camp east of Gaza City, activists burned tires, releasing black smoke. Others threw stones or flew kites with burning rags attached, aiming to send them over the border and set Israeli fields on fire.
Israeli troops fired volleys of tear gas, including from drones, that sent protesters running for cover.
One man with a bullhorn shouted, “America is the biggest evil.”
At one point, seven activists in black-and-white striped shirts meant to resemble concentration camp uniforms from World War II approached the fence.
“We want to remind the world that the Israeli occupation is committing the same massacres that the Nazis committed,” said activist Ahmed Abu Artima.
The attempt to draw a parallel between Gaza’s suffering and the Holocaust was bound to draw angry reactions.
The mass protests have been aimed at a border blockade imposed by Israel and Egypt in 2007, after the Islamic militant group Hamas overran the territory. The marchers have also pressed demands for a “right of return” for descendants of Palestinian refugees to ancestral homes in what is now Israel.
More than 700,000 Palestinians were expelled or fled in the 1948 Mideast war over Israel’s creation. Two-thirds of Gaza’s 2 million residents are descendants of refugees.
Protester Fadi Saleh said the frequent marches have helped revive sympathies in the Arab world for the Palestinians, but that more could be done.
“We need real Arab support and solidarity with our cause,” said Saleh, a student of Arabic literature who wore a medical mask against the tear gas.
Israel’s use of potentially lethal force against the protesters has drawn international criticism. Rights groups have said Israel’s open-fire rules are unlawful.
Israel has accused Hamas of trying to carry out attacks and damage the fence under the guise of the protests. Hamas leaders have threatened possible mass border breaches, raising concern in Israel that communities near Gaza might be at risk.
The protests have largely been organized by Hamas and to some extent by the smaller Islamic Jihad militant group. Both have received political and financial support from Iran, but they also pursue their own agendas. Growing despair in Gaza over blockade-linked hardships, including daily power cuts and rising poverty, have driven turnout.
Israel and Egypt argue that they must maintain the blockade to contain Hamas and other militant groups, which have built up arsenals over the years, including short-range rockets. Israel and Hamas have fought three cross-border wars since 2008.
The Jerusalem Day protests are being held each year on the last Friday of the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan. The day is known in Arabic as “Al Quds Day,” a reference to the city’s historic Arabic name.
Israel captured east Jerusalem in the 1967 Mideast war and annexed it to its capital, a move not recognized by most of the international community. Israel’s current government has said it will not accept a partition of the city as part of a peace deal with the Palestinians.
The eastern sector houses major shrines revered by Muslims, Christians and Jews. The Al-Aqsa Mosque compound in east Jerusalem, the third holiest site in Islam, is built on the spot where tradition says the Prophet Muhammad ascended to heaven. The compound sits on the ruins of biblical temples and is revered by Jews as the holiest site of their religion.
In Iran’s capital of Tehran, thousands joined a Jerusalem Day march, chanting “Death to Israel” and burning a Trump effigy.
In Iraq, thousands of Iran-backed Shiite militiamen in uniform marched through the streets of the capital of Baghdad, burning an Israeli flag and carrying posters of the late Iranian leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini and Supreme Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.

Now she spends much of her time worrying about food, scouring Gaza’s vegetable markets for end-of-day discounts or walking miles for a pot of free gruel from a soup kitchen.
Large numbers of Gaza families have been pushed deeper into poverty in recent months by Palestinian political infighting and the freezing of U.S. aid. Life is tougher than ever for most of the 2 million Palestinians locked into tiny, blockaded Gaza, where electricity is off most hours of the day, unemployment approaches 50 percent and the Islamic militant group Hamas rules with a tight grip.
“It’s a perfect storm,” said Hilary DuBose of the Catholic Relief Services, which has had to forego emergency food distributions because the Trump administration is withholding funds. “At the same time that the humanitarian situation in Gaza is worsening, humanitarian aid is disappearing.”
Growing despair in Gaza has helped drive recent Hamas-led protests against the border blockade by Israel and Egypt. The closure was imposed after Hamas, branded a terrorist group by Israel and the West, seized Gaza in 2007, driving out forces loyal to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas.
The escalating crisis also spotlights the lack of a coherent Gaza policy by the external players trying to shape its future. Israel and Egypt say they need the blockade to contain Hamas, but have not offered a viable plan for Gaza. The international community wants the blockade lifted, but hasn’t said how it would deal with Hamas, which refuses to disarm or renounce violence.
Hassan — who shares her unfinished cinderblock home with seven of her 12 adult children, three daughters-in-law and 16 grandchildren — said she joined the border protests repeatedly, intentionally getting close to the fence in hopes of getting shot and killed by Israeli troops.
“Death is better than this life,” she said to her sons’ astonishment as the family gathered for the meal breaking the dawn-to-dusk fast of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.
Hassan said she only pulled back because she realized she could end up crippled rather than dead and become a burden. In the past two months, more than 115 Palestinians have been killed and close to 3,800 wounded by Israeli fire in near-weekly border protests, with some facing lifelong disabilities.
Hassan, who wears the black robe and full face veil of ultra-conservative Muslim women, is angry at Hamas, which has fought three cross-border wars with Israel.
“It’s because of them,” she said of her family’s hard times.
In the last war in 2014, the family taxi, an important source of income, was destroyed in an Israeli airstrike on a neighbor’s house. After the war’s devastation, her sons only found work sporadically and one — a father of six — is now in jail for being unable to pay his debts.
The family suffered a new blow after Abbas ordered his West Bank autonomy government to curtail its regular support payments to Gaza, in hopes of pressing Hamas to hand over authority.
The Hassans used to get $500 every three months from Abbas’ Palestinian Authority, but haven’t been paid since the beginning of the year, along with tens of thousands of Gaza welfare recipients, said Social Affairs Ministry official Khaled Barghouti.
Meanwhile, some 60,000 former civil servants, paid by Abbas since 2007 to ensure their loyalty, have received only a fraction of their salaries since March.
With barely any money coming in, the Hassans increasingly rely on charity.
During Ramadan, Samia Hassan often walks five kilometers (three miles) to another Gaza City neighborhood to line up for wheat gruel cooked in a large cauldron over an open fire.
Hassan said her sons won’t make the trip, embarrassed to be seen asking for handouts, but that she doesn’t mind because her face is veiled.
On a recent afternoon, dozens of people jostled, pushing their aluminum or plastic food containers to be filled. The huge pot was empty within 10 minutes.
“The situation is difficult for everyone,” said Walid Hattab, 50, who owns a small coffee-and-spice store and cooks the free meals as Ramadan charity. Demand is up from last year, he said, noting that merchants have stopped selling on credit.
Along with the Palestinian Authority, the U.N. has been instrumental in propping up Gaza’s fragile economy. About two-thirds of Gaza’s residents are eligible for health, education or welfare services from UNRWA, the agency that aids descendants of Palestinian refugees from the 1948 war over Israel’s creation.
Need has grown exponentially, with some 1 million people in Gaza now receiving U.N. food aid, compared to 80,000 two decades ago, said agency spokesman Chris Gunness.
At the same time, the Trump administration has blown a $305 million hole into the agency’s annual $1.2 billion budget — the result of a decision earlier this year to suspend most aid to the Palestinians until further notice. Washington has said it’s linking future funding to UNRWA reforms.
UNRWA has raised more than $200 million from other donors, but is still struggling. Money for Gaza food distributions could run out in a couple of months, Gunness said.
With the exception of the funds already spent this year, all U.S. assistance to the Palestinians is under review. This includes projects funded by USAID and the State Department, including health, education, good governance and security cooperation programs.
There is no indication the review will be completed any time soon, if ever, and it appears to be driven in part by Abbas’ decision to boycott Washington’s Mideast peace efforts as well as Palestinian moves to assert themselves at the United Nations.
Charities such as Catholic Relief Services rely heavily on U.S. support. In Gaza, its operations have been underwritten by a five-year, $50 million USAID grant. This year, the charity should have received about $10 million, but hasn’t gotten any money so far, said DuBose.
As a result, 20,000 Gaza families aren’t receiving food vouchers and about 2,200 people eligible for job-creation programs are staying home, she said.
Muslim countries such as Qatar, Iran, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates have stepped up aid during Ramadan. Qatar is distributing 1 million meals for the month and Iran 11,000 per day.
But it’s not clear if such aid will be sustained after the holy month.
On a recent evening, Samia Hassan and two dozen family members sat on the straw mat-covered floor of their home. Salad and leftover gruel from the day before had been laid out. Just before iftar, volunteers from a nearby mosque sent over a tray of rice with one chicken.
“It came at the right time,” said daughter-in-law Samah, holding a toddler in her lap.
Such uncertainty is tough for Samia. “Our situation has never been like this,” she said.

The report looked at 108 lead-poisoning cases reported to the city’s prevention program from 2012 to 2017 and found that more than 90 percent of the cases were closed before the amount of lead in children’s blood had dropped to safe levels, the Journal Sentinel reported. In none of the reviewed cases did the city provide documented risk assessments for lead in the homes of lead-poisoned children, and in a quarter of the cases there was no record of an investigator even visiting the home of a child with lead poisoning.
The state has given Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett until June 30 to develop a plan to address the concerns. The state also demanded the city review all 491 lead-poisoning cases that were reported from 2012 to 2017 to ensure the affected children have had proper medical care and house inspections.

Why it matters: According to the Centers for Disease Control, exposure to lead “can affect nearly every system in the body.” The World Health Organization says in children, high levels of lead can lead to comas, convulsions and even death. Low levels can lead to adverse brain development, reduced intelligence, antisocial behavior, kidney impairments and hypertension, among other problems. In fact, there is no level of lead exposure that is considered safe.

The report is the latest echo of a renewed national focus on lead levels in the wake of Michigan’s Flint water crisis, which began in 2014 after the city changed water sources. This caused children’s lead levels to skyrocket, and stay elevated for several months, according to the CDC, which tested 7,000 children but added that it couldn’t estimate just how many kids were affected overall. A study published in March in the Journal of Pediatrics showed that lead levels in Flint children reached an all-time low in 2016, according to the Detroit Free Press. But a 2016 Reuters investigation suggested this was a problem in many more places than just Flint, finding nearly 3,000 places across the U.S. with higher rates of lead poisoning.
Milwaukee’s Health Department website claims that the prevalence of children with lead in the blood has “dramatically declined” in recent years. Still, in 2016, 11.6 percent of Milwaukee children tested had low levels of lead in their blood, according to Milwaukee’s Health Department.

One in four adolescent girls in South Sudan have considered suicide in the last year, according to a new report published by the children’s organization Plan International.
Close to 2 million women and girls are at risk of gender-based violence in South Sudan, the U.N. says. This latest report, “Adolescent Girls In Crisis: Voices from South Sudan,” was compiled from interviews with 249 girls between the ages of 10 and 19. Thirty-three percent of adolescent women and girls have been the victim of sexual violence from non-partners, the report found; many of those instances “were connected to displacement, abduction or a raid.”
The girls also cited health care as a driving concern. Close to 50 percent of South Sudan’s medical facilities have been destroyed, according to the health ministry, and “many clinics and hospitals have been looted of their equipment and others have been deliberately targeted by armed groups,” the Plan International report says. South Sudanese girls “have only sporadic access to a doctor,” and 77 percent of interviewees reported they do not have enough food. [Reuters]
Why it matters: Young Sudanese girls are facing an uncertain future as their nation enters its fifth year of civil war. More than 2 million people have been internally displaced and around 2.5 million more have fled the country, creating Africa’s largest refugee crisis, according to the U.N. Sixty-five percent of those refugees are children under 18.
The U.N. has outlined a humanitarian response plan for 2018, which called for $1.7 billion to deliver “urgent humanitarian assistance,” such as food, supplies, health interventions and protection.
Other countries, including the U.S., have spent millions in aid for South Sudan. But the U.N. in February said funding for the 2018 plan was falling short.
U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley wrote in an op-ed in the Washington Post that “ children of South Sudan cannot wait.”
She called on the U.N. Security Council to impose an arms embargo, writing: “By imposing financial and travel restrictions on individuals responsible for threatening the peace, we can ensure they pay a cost for perpetuating violence. Only then can we begin to change the calculus of those who profit from war.”
In January 2014, Gregory Vaughn Hill Jr. was shot four times and killed by a St. Lucie County, Florida, sheriff.
According to court documents, a parent picking up her child from a nearby school called police with a noise complaint about Hill’s home, where the 30-year-old was listening to music in his garage. When deputies arrived they knocked on the garage door, and then knocked on the front door when he failed to respond. This is when Hill partially opened the garage door — but then began to close it. Deputies claim they saw Hill with his “left hand on the garage door and his right hand down,” prompting one of them, Christopher Newman, to shoot through the garage door in an upward motion as it was closing.
Hill was struck by multiple bullets, according to court documents, including one to the head, which killed him. He died at the scene, but deputies believed Hill was still alive, which led to a SWAT standoff. Deputies later found an unloaded handgun in Hill’s back pocket.
Four years later, a jury announced after 10 hours of deliberation that the family would receive a total of $4 in damages: $1 for each for his three children and another for funeral expenses. That was further reduced to $0.04, because the jury found the sheriff’s office “1 percent liable” for the fatal shooting. The jury found that Hill was intoxicated — with a blood alcohol level of 0.4, several times the legal limit, according to toxicology reports — at the time of the confrontation, and therefore 99 percent responsible for his death.
In a statement after the decision, Sheriff Ken Mascara said, “We are pleased to see this difficult and tragic incident come to a conclusion,” adding that “Deputy Newman was placed in a very difficult situation” and “made the best decision he could have for his partner, himself, and the public given the circumstances he faced.”
Monique Davis, Hill’s fiance, described the jury’s decision as a “slap in the face.” “There are a lot of questions I want to ask,” she told the New York Times.
The family’s attorney, John Phillips, plans to appeal the jury’s verdict. The family has set up a GoFundMe account for Hill’s children. “It seems like the jury gave up,” Phillips said. [The New York Times]
Why it matters: The case has raised many questions and caused plenty of confusion, both over state and federal laws but also how a jury determines the amount of money a family is awarded in damages after a police-involved shooting.
The jury was tasked with settling two claims: whether Hill’s federal civil rights were violated, and also whether the sheriff’s office was negligent in handling the case. The jury appeared to be confused when weighing those claims, the family’s lawyer, Phillips told the local newspaper TCPalm.
Some questions sent to the judge by the jury were never answered, Phillips pointed out, and at one point they struggled to reach a unanimous decision.
The jury has not come forward since the decision to offer insight into its decision (and they aren’t required to). But another lawyer told TCPalm that “the option of nominal damages is given to juries as a way to acknowledge a wrong, even if they don’t believe large damages are warranted.”
“In cases like this with nominal awards, juries are saying, ‘We don’t like what happened, but we’re not awarding a lot (of money) to it,” Osamudia James, who teaches law at the University of Miami, said.

Late last week, Spotify appeared to reverse a decision that resulted in the removal of R. Kelly and XXXTentacion’s music from its algorithm-driven playlists.
In April, Spotify announced a new “Hate Content & Hateful Conduct Policy” that pushed for “openness, diversity, tolerance and respect” on the giant streaming platform. “We don’t censor content because of an artist’s or creator’s behavior, but we want our editorial decisions—what we choose to program—to reflect our values,” Spotify said of its decision at the time. The music was still apparently available, but the company said it didn’t want to promote it.
In a June 1 statement, Spotify said that while the company believes “our intentions were good, the language was too vague, we created confusion and concern,” adding that it hadn’t spent enough time getting input internally from its own team and from their partners before issuing the guidelines.
R. Kelly has repeatedly denied years-old sexual misconduct allegations against him. But the Time’s Up movement in Hollywood, borne out of the #MeToo era, has recently put the allegations back in the spotlight, backing a #MuteRKelly campaign in response to the claims against him. Rapper XXXTentacion is facing several charges after being arrested in 2016, including a charge of aggravated battery of a pregnant woman.
Why it matters: The initial policy sparked backlash against Spotify, as chronicled in this Bloomberg report. Several representatives for musicians, including rapper Kendrick Lamar, pushed back on Spotify’s policy and threatened to pull their music from the streaming platform if the policy remained.
As Pitchfork’s Jillian Mapes pointed out, there were too few details provided by Spotify that let people know how its policy would actually work.
A day before the official reversal, Spotify CEO Daniel Ek signaled that the company had bungled the rollout of the policy.
“It wasn’t trying to be a moral police, like who did right and who did wrong. We don’t want to be the judge and the moral police,” Ek is quoted as saying by Buzzfeed News. Ek added that the company wasn’t trying to make an example of any one artist.
Sexual misconduct allegations have lately had professional consequences for some artists, including actor Kevin Spacey, who was edited out of the movie “All the Money in the World,” and comedian Louis C.K., whose past work was entirely removed from HBO’s online platform. The attempt by Spotify to take a stand raised hypotheticals like whether a “hateful conduct” policy would also consider years-old allegations and whether it addressed both allegations and convictions. Without clear guidelines, the policy created confusion over how it could possibly address such a wide-ranging issue.
“The reality is, the amount of key figures throughout music history who could qualify as having ‘hateful conduct’ at some point is staggering and, as societal norms shift, ever-changing. Carefully parsing all of it would be a project beyond reasonable management for Spotify, and possibly for any single organization,” Pitchfork’s Mapes wrote.

Jordan’s Prime Minister Hani Mulki resigned Monday after four days of mass protests that resulted in clashes with police involving tear gas, and led to dozens injured and detained.
The protesters have been demonstrating against proposed tax increases that Mulki refused to scrap, instead punting the decision to parliament, the BBC reported. Mulki’s administration claimed the government needed the money to fund public services and that only people with higher incomes would be taxed, but protesters feared it would worsen living standards. The proposed tax hike comes amid years of a rising cost of living — the cost of fuel has increased five times in 2018 — with salaries failing to keep up. Earlier this year, bread subsidies were nixed and sales taxes were increased as part of a plan to tackle the country’s debt.
On Monday, King Abdullah II summoned Mulki to his palace and demanded the prime minister’s resignation. Reports say that Abdullah II has chosen Omar Razzaz, the education minister and a former World Bank economist, to lead a new government. [BBC]
Why it matters: Jordan is a key Western ally and political unrest could have major repercussions. The country will be receiving over a billion dollars in U.S. aid per year for the next five years, has thousands of U.S. troops stationed within its borders and provides valuable intelligence to the U.S. government.
Jordan has mostly avoided the turmoil of the Arab Spring revolutions, protests, coups and civil wars, but still bears some of the aftermath, harboring over 700,000 refugees — including more than 650,000 Syrians, according to the United Nations. Neighboring war-torn Syria, Jordan possesses the second highest proportion of refugees to population in the world, according to the U.N. and further clouds an already gloomy economic forecast.
It’s unclear whether Mulki’s successor Razzaz will embrace the tax increases, but with an unemployment rate above 18 percent, a regional refugee crisis, increasing living costs, mass protests and a changing government, Jordan’s internal stability is being tested at a time when instability is always at its doorstep."
https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/supreme-court-sides-with-trump-administration-in-pregnant-teen-case,refugee,827,2018-06-04T11:20:34-04:00,"Jessica Gresko, Associated Press",Supreme Court sides with Trump administration in pregnant teen case,"WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court is rejecting a suggestion by the Trump administration that lawyers for the American Civil Liberties Union might deserve to be sanctioned in the case of a pregnant immigrant teen it helped obtain an abortion.
But the court on Monday sided with the government in wiping away a lower court decision in favor of the teen, who had been held in government custody after illegally entering the country. The justices ruled that vacating a lower court decision in favor of the teen was the proper course because the case became moot after the teen obtained an abortion. The decision is about the teen’s individual case, however, and doesn’t appear to disrupt ongoing litigation about the ability of immigrant teens in government custody to obtain abortions.
At government's request, Supreme Court vacates appeals-court ruling that cleared the way for undocumented teen to obtain abortion, does not rule on government's request to sanction teen's attorneys
— SCOTUSblog (@SCOTUSblog) June 4, 2018
Government lawyers had complained that ACLU lawyers didn’t alert them that the teen’s abortion would take place earlier than expected and told the court that it might want to issue an order “to show cause why disciplinary action should not be taken” against ACLU lawyers. The administration said that deprived its lawyers of the chance to ask the Supreme Court to block the procedure, at least temporarily. The ACLU said its lawyers did nothing wrong.
The Supreme Court declined to wade into the finger-pointing between the sides.
“Especially in fast-paced, emergency proceedings like those at issue here, it is critical that lawyers and courts alike be able to rely on one another’s representations. On the other hand, lawyers also have ethical obligations to their clients and not all communications breakdowns constitute misconduct,” the justices wrote in an unsigned opinion, adding that the court “need not delve into the factual disputes raised by the parties” in order to vacate the decision for the teen.
The teen at the center of the case entered the U.S. illegally in September as a 17-year-old and was taken to a federally funded shelter in Texas for minors who enter the country without their parents. The unnamed teen, referred to as Jane Doe, learned while in custody that she was pregnant and sought an abortion. A state court gave her permission, but federal officials — citing a policy of refusing to facilitate abortions for pregnant minors in its shelters — refused to transport her or temporarily release her so that others could take her for the procedure.
The ACLU helped the teen sue the Trump administration, and after a federal appeals court sided with her, the government was preparing to ask the Supreme Court to step in and block the procedure, at least temporarily.
But the teen, allowed out of the shelter by court order, had an abortion first, about 12 hours after a court gave her the go-ahead. In response, the Trump administration, in a highly unusual filing with the Supreme Court, cried foul. The ACLU has defended its attorneys actions, saying government lawyers made assumptions about the timing of the teen’s abortion and argued that the decision should stand.
Even though Jane Doe was able to get an abortion, the lawsuit that began with her has continued and could return to the Supreme Court at a later date. Scott Lloyd, the director of the Department of Health and Human Services’ Office of Refugee Resettlement, which oversees shelters for unaccompanied immigrant minors, has said he believes teens in his agency’s care have no constitutional right to abortion.
And since the Jane Doe case was filed, several other pregnant teens in his agency’s care have come forward seeking abortions and been represented by the ACLU. In two cases, the young women were released from custody and able to seek the procedure on their own while in another case the teen, a 17-year-old rape victim, got a court order allowing her to obtain an abortion and the government stopped attempting to block the procedure.
In March, following a request from the ACLU, a judge barred the Trump administration from interfering with the ability of any pregnant immigrant teens in its custody to obtain abortions while a class action lawsuit against the administration goes forward.
U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan ordered the Trump administration to post notices in government-run shelters that tell pregnant women that they have a right to decide whether to have the baby or to end their pregnancy. The notice gives teens a person to call if they are having difficulty getting an abortion or if they are being pressured not to have an abortion. Chutkan, who was appointed by President Barack Obama, is also requiring minors in shelters to be given the notice in English and Spanish and that the information be included in an orientation for minors entering the shelters. The government is appealing.
