The U.S. president has spent the final days of the campaign hammering the issue as he tries to energize Republican voters, and his favorite target has been the migrant caravan of almost 4,000 people that is still more than 800 miles away from the nearest U.S. border. Three smaller ones are following behind it.

Trump’s recent statements include that he plans to sign an order that could lead to the detention of migrants crossing the southern border, and barring anyone caught crossing illegally from claiming asylum. Both propositions are legally dubious. Trump also said he had told the U.S. military mobilizing at the southwest border that if U.S. troops face rock-throwing migrants, they should react as though the rocks were “rifles.”
“It is pure ignorance for him to think like that,” said Marta Cuellos, a 40-year-old from Tegucigalpa, the Honduran capital. “A rock is not the same as a rifle.”
While some migrants have clashed with Mexican police at a bridge on the Guatemala border, most of those traveling with the caravans have been peaceful and say they are fleeing violence and poverty at home. Those traveling through the southern state of Oaxaca on Friday said they are not looking for trouble.
Cuellos said she owned a cantina back home in Honduras but left because she could no longer make rent and was being harassed by police. She persuaded her 35-year-old sister to join her on the trip, and said the only thing they want is work and a better life in the United States. It’s her second attempt. She first crossed into the U.S. seven years ago but was deported last year.

Selvin Maldonado, a 25-year-old from Copan, Honduras, said he left his wife and baby daughter at home in search of a better living to support his children. He took his 5-year-old son, Dennys, with him.
“What Trump said is stupid,” Maldonado said while walking to the town of Donaji. “I don’t want to attack police, because my concern is my son.”
The migrants also were also turned off by the U.S. president’s characterization of the slow-moving caravan and the three smaller ones following as “invasion.” Trump has proposed detaining migrants in massive tent cities at the border.

“We are not killers,” said Stephany Lopez, a 21-year-old Salvadoran with the first caravan. “We just want to work for a few years, and after that he can deport us if he wants.”
Lopez noted that the president’s mother, who was born in Scotland, was an immigrant.
“He should think of us as equals. Immigrants have built that country,” she said.
In June, U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions said that domestic and gang violence would generally no longer be accepted as reasons for migrants to be granted asylum. Trump has said this week that those in the caravan would not get asylum — though U.S. law allows them the right to apply — and warned them to turn around.
The Trump administration’s vehement opposition and tough rhetoric has at least some in the caravan weighing alternatives.
Tifany Morandis, 19, was traveling with her husband, 28-year-old Javier Sanchez, and their two sons, 7-year-old Angel and 9-month-old Cesar. Her nose and face sun-scorched after many days on the road, she said she was very tired and is considering stopping in Tijuana, the Mexican border city across from San Diego.
“Donald Trump has made things very complicated at the border, and better that we stay in Tijuana than fight with him,” Morandis said.
But many are hopeful. “Even stones can soften,” Cuellos said."
https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/ap-fact-check-president-trumps-rhetoric-and-the-truth-about-migrant-caravans,migrant,824,2018-11-02T09:35:08-04:00,"Hope Yen, Associated Press",AP fact check: President Trump’s rhetoric and the truth about migrant caravans,"WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump is spreading misleading rhetoric about the nature of Central American migrants heading to the U.S. border and grossly inflating the number of immigrants living in the U.S. illegally.
In a speech Thursday, he suggested without evidence that the migrant caravans are full of hardened criminals; in fact, they are mostly poor people with few belongings who are fleeing gang violence.
In stressing that his administration will not allow a “catch and release” policy, Trump also claimed this week that 25 million to 30 million immigrants now live in the country illegally because previous administrations had “released” immigrants in the U.S. after they had been caught crossing the border as they awaited immigration hearings.
He’s wrong. Independent estimates put the number of people in the U.S. illegally at less than half that amount.
A look at his various claims on immigration:
TRUMP: “At this very moment, large well-organized caravans of migrants are marching towards our southern border. Some people call it an invasion. …These are tough people in many cases; a lot of young men, strong men and a lot of men that maybe we don’t want in our country. …This isn’t an innocent group of people. It’s a large number of people that are tough. They have injured, they have attacked.” — immigration speech Thursday.
THE FACTS: He suggests without evidence that people in the caravans are, by and large, dangerous, hardened criminals.
The migrants in the caravans are mostly from Honduras, where it started, as well as El Salvador and Guatemala. Overall, they are poor, carrying the belongings that fit into a knapsack and fleeing gang violence or poverty.
It might be true there are some criminals mixed in with the throngs, given the sheer number of migrants. Trump did not substantiate his claim that members of the MS-13 gang, in particular, are among them.
Some migrants in one of the caravans clashed with Mexican police at the Mexico-Guatemala border, hurling stones and other objects as they tried to cross the international bridge. One migrant died; it’s not clear how it happened. Caravan leaders said they had expelled a number of troublemakers from the procession, exhibiting some self-policing. Ultimately, most entered Guatemala — and later, Mexico — by illegally bypassing immigration checkpoints.
The caravan otherwise has been overwhelmingly peaceful, receiving applause and donated food from residents of the towns they pass. Mexican police have not tried again to stop them.
The Department of Homeland Security issued a fact sheet stating that “over 270 individuals along the caravan route have criminal histories, including known gang membership.” But it did not specify how it had arrived at that number.
TRUMP: “President Obama separated the children from parents and nobody complained. When we continued the exact same law, the country went crazy.” — immigration speech Thursday.
THE FACTS: Actually, President Barack Obama did not do the same thing as a matter of policy.
While it’s true the underlying laws were the same, the Trump administration mandated anyone caught crossing the border illegally was to be criminally prosecuted. That policy meant adults were taken to court for criminal proceedings, and their children were separated and sent into the care of the Health and Human Services Department, which is tasked with caring for unaccompanied migrant children. The so-called zero tolerance policy remains in effect, but Trump signed an executive order June 20 that stopped separations.
Jeh Johnson, Obama’s homeland security secretary, recently told NPR there may have been unusual or emergency circumstances when children were taken from parents, but there was no such policy.
TRUMP: “Asylum is not a program for those living in poverty.” — speech Thursday.
THE FACTS: He’s largely right. Poverty may play a role in the complex decision process granting asylum, but the status is reserved for people who have a justifiable fear of persecution in their own country based on factors such as their race, religion or political views. According to the Homeland Security Department, about 20 percent of claimants are granted asylum. Currently, there is a backlog of about 700,000 cases, and it can take years for claims to get resolved.
TRUMP: “We’re not doing releases. What’s been happening over years is they would come in, release them, and they would never show up for their trial. And we now have 25 or 30 million people in this country illegally, because of what’s been happening over many years.” — remarks Wednesday to reporters.
THE FACTS: It’s nowhere close to 25 million to 30 million, nor has the number increased much in recent years.
The nonpartisan Pew Research Center estimates there were about 11.3 million immigrants in the U.S. illegally in 2016, according to the most recent data available. That number is basically unchanged from 2009.
The number of such immigrants had reached a height of 12.2 million in 2007, representing about 4 percent of the U.S. population, before declining due in part to a weakening U.S. economy."
https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/migrants-set-out-on-arduous-60-mile-journey-to-next-stop,migrant,948,2018-10-26T10:48:30-04:00,"Christopher Sherman, Associated Press",Migrants set out on arduous 60-mile journey to next stop,"PIJIJIAPAN, Mexico — Increasingly sick and facing a punishing 60-mile (100 kilometer) trek, members of the migrant caravan began leaving the southern Mexico city of Pijijiapan on Friday and walking in the pre-dawn darkness to the next stop, Arriaga.
The migrants’ coughs could be heard in the darkness long before their faces become visible.
Yamileth Caldames, one of those making the arduous journey, went to the highway, took a look at what lay ahead, and returned to town with her sleeping 3-year-old daughter in her arms. Her 5-year-old daughter walked alongside her, while the children’s father pushed an empty stroller through the dark.
“My blood pressure is bad,” Caldames said.
With what little money they still had, they planned to buy bus tickets most of the way to Arriaga to try to regain their strength.
But if Mexican police catch them riding a bus, they could tell the driver to drop them off on the road. Authorities are enforcing an obscure highway insurance rule in an apparent bid to make families like the Caldemes walk as much of the way as possible.
Many of the migrants already had blistered feet before they reached Pijijiapan on Thursday, and the town’s main plaza quickly became a makeshift triage center as the caravan of about 4,000 Central Americans arrived.
A severely dehydrated woman connected to an IV line sat on a plastic chair in a gazebo. Nearby, volunteer nurses took temperatures and treated coughs, handing out donated medicine as migrants lined up.
Two weeks of walking have taken a toll on the caravan as they slowly march through Chiapas, Mexico’s southernmost state.
On Thursday, Dr. Jesus Miravete treated more than 120 people. Many had burns on their feet from walking in plastic sandals on the steaming highway.
“So many tell me: ‘I can’t rest. I have to go on,'” Miravete said. “It’s really hard. I feel overwhelmed, above all by the number of dehydrated children I have seen.”
As in many places in Chiapas, residents in Pijijiapan turned out in force to aid the travelers as they streamed in on foot, offering shelter, food and medical treatment. Some people offered rides to the plaza. Others showed up with used clothes and boxes of sandwiches.
The caravan was welcomed in a similar fashion into Mapastepec, a municipality of 45,000 residents 30 miles (48 kilometers) to the south where city officials put up tents around the main square offering everything from medical attention to donated clothing to baby formula. Local churches offered free showers and set up food distribution points.
“They are human beings. You have to do something to help them,” said Cesar Cabuqui, who handed out dozens of homemade bean and cheese sandwiches and bags of water.
Grateful for the hospitality, many of the migrants have tried to be respectful visitors.
Jose Reyneri Castellanos, from El Progreso, Honduras, hung back behind the rest of the caravan with his wife and two young sons to help sweep and tidy up in Mapastepec as he’d done at each stop, figuring it well help ensure a continued warm reception as they head north.
“I think it is important to leave the community and the city clean,” Castellanos said.
Many of the migrants say they are dreaming of finding better lives in the United States. They say they have been driven to leave their homelands by severe poverty and rising gang violence.
Such caravans have taken place regularly, if on a smaller scale, over the years, but U.S. President Donald Trump has seized on the phenomenon this year. At recent rallies and on Twitter, he has been talking about the caravan and illegal immigration, repeatedly hitting Democrats with the issue as the U.S. heads into the hotly contested Nov. 6 midterm elections.
Defense Secretary Jim Mattis was expected to sign an order to send 800 or more additional troops to the southern border to support the Border Patrol, according to a U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly because details had not yet been finalized.
The caravan is still some 1,000 miles from the nearest border crossing at McAllen, Texas, but the journey could be twice that if the migrants head to the Tijuana-San Diego crossing. That was the destination of a smaller caravan earlier this year, and only about 200 in the group made it.
This group also has begun to thin. Authorities say 1,740 have applied for refuge in Mexico and hundreds more have taken up offers of bus rides back to Honduras. Sickness, exhaustion and police harassment have helped whittle down their numbers.
Immigration officials appeared to be intervening more aggressively with the migrants’ movements amid the sweltering 90-degree heat.
A taxi driver in Mapastepec said he had seen immigration agents force migrant passengers out of cabs at a checkpoint.
An official from the country’s Human Rights Commission said migrants could go through if they were in vans or trucks that offered them free rides, but if they had paid they would have to get out because of the insurance regulations.
On Thursday, the long column stretched for miles along the highway. Families with young children packed sidewalks asking for donations and rides.
Candy Guillermo, 37, said she had heard from others in the caravan about Trump intending to send U.S. troops to the border. A single mother of four, she was puzzled that the leader of such a powerful country would find her and the families traveling alongside her a threat.
“It surprises me because there are children here. President Trump should be more humanitarian,” Guillermo said, wiping sweat from her brow. “We only want to give our kids a better future.”"
https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/migrants-set-out-anew-on-quest-to-reach-distant-u-s-border,migrant,577,2018-10-24T11:51:14-04:00,"Mark Stevenson, Associated Press",Migrants set out anew on quest to reach distant U.S. border,"HUIXTLA, Mexico — Thousands of Central American migrants renewed their hoped-for march to the United States on Wednesday, setting out before dawn with plans to travel another 45 miles of the more than 1,000 miles that still lie before them.
The five days of walking in the southernmost reaches of Mexico — after seven days in Honduras and Guatemala — were beginning to show: Mexican authorities said Wednesday that about 500 migrants had accepted an offer to be bused back to their countries. Many said they were sick or exhausted, especially the children who toddled or were carried along on the march.
Still, the size of the caravan — estimated by the United Nations at more than 7,000 strong — seemed basically undiminished as the throng set out in darkness cut by occasional flashlights or the spotlights of municipal police who were escorting them.
Rosa Duvon of Cofradia Cortes in Honduras was pushing two baby boys, both named Daniel — a son and a nephew — in a rickety donated baby carriage over a potholes road at 5 a.m.
“This thing is going to die,” she said of the carriage, pointing to a wobbly back wheel. Still, she vowed to keep going.
In worse condition was Maria del Carmen Mejia of Copan, Honduras, who was already sweating profusely before dawn. She carried in her arms 3-year-old Britany Sofia Alvarado, while with her other hand she clutch the hand of Miralia Alejandra Alvarado, 7, who was also sweaty — and fevered.
Miralia “isn’t well, has a fever. Let’s see if they give us a ride up ahead. I’m worn out now.” But she too pledged to go on. “I’ve walked a long way. I don’t want to return. I want a better future for my children.”
While the group has been discouraged by Mexico’s government — and prompted threats of aid cutoffs for their homelands from U.S. President Donald Trump — they have received an outpouring of help from locals as they pass by.
Neighbors have supplied the marchers — many of them largely penniless — with food and passersby have stopped to give them rides in cars, pickups, even dump trucks.
Such caravans have taken place regularly, if on a smaller scale, over the years, but U.S. President Donald Trump has seized on the phenomenon this year and made it a rallying call for his Republican base ahead of Nov. 6 midterm elections.
Trump has blamed Democrats for what he said were weak immigration laws and claimed — with no evidence — that MS-13 gang members and unknown “Middle Easterners” were hiding among the migrants.
Trump later acknowledged there was “no proof” of the claim Middle Easterners were in the crowd. But he tweeted Wednesday that the U.S. “will never accept people coming into our Country illegally!”
The caravan had advanced about 45 miles (75 kilometers) since crossing the border from Guatemala and the marchers hoped to trek another 45 miles on Wednesday to the town of Mapastepec.
Even if they eventually reach the distant U.S. border, many have low odds of qualifying for asylum: The United States does not consider things like fleeing from poverty or gang violence as a qualifying factor.
Nearly 1,700 from the current caravan have already dropped out and applied for asylum in Mexico and hundreds more have decided to return hope. The numbers could thin further as people decide to take their chances in Mexico or strike out on their own."
https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/what-happens-when-migrants-die-in-the-arizona-desert,migrant,1856,2018-10-22T17:30:31-04:00,Jessica Villagomez,What happens when migrants die in the Arizona desert?,"TUCSON, Ariz. — Jennifer Vollner leaned over a small collection of human bones spread out on a metal table in her office, looking for clues. The bones belonged to an unidentified migrant who had died in the desert in Pima County, Arizona, after crossing illegally into the United States from Mexico.
The fragments recovered from the corpse gave Vollner, one of the county’s forensic anthropologists, little to work with: A left femur, a part of the right leg, portions of the lower vertebrae, and a skull. The only object that had been found with the corpse was a single Nike sneaker, gray and covered in dirt.
Carefully, Vollner, who wore a white coat and glasses, placed the sneaker between the two leg fragments on the table. The shoe, positioned that way, gave the remains some sense of person. It was a silent reminder that the hard, dust-colored bones had belonged to an individual; a person who once made small daily decisions about what to wear and what to eat, and who, at some point in the not-too-distant past, had made a much bigger, more consequential decision — to attempt a dangerous desert trek across the border and into the U.S.
Using her bare hands, Vollner picked up the femur and reexamined the bone, taking a closer look at a section with a small, neat incision. Vollner had cut into it earlier, in the process of conducting more tests. In these types of cases, Vollner said as she worked, the odds of identifying the remains are always slim.
“Unfortunately with these individuals, when they’ve been exposed to the desert and that environment for a really long time, we lose information,” she said. But that doesn’t mean people shouldn’t try, she added.
“These people had families, had friends, had a name that they were given at birth,” Vollner said. “That’s something that we hope to restore to them in death.”
Vollner, an expert on skeletal biology, has spent her career analyzing the remains of people who died under unforeseen circumstances. Vollner creates a profile of the person, determining if they were male or female, their age and height, some insight into their ancestry.
Yet these days, most of the bones Vollner examines spark more questions than answers. Many belong to unidentified migrants who died in the desert, often nameless and without identification. Most of the bones that pass through Vollner’s hands were recovered well after the person’s death.
As federal and state officials deal with the aftermath of the Trump administration’s policy of separating families at the border, and as another caravan of migrants heads toward the U.S. border, many are asking: What happens when migrants come to the U.S.? For those in communities along the border, like Vollner, the question is: What happens when they die along the way?

‘The smell of it haunts you’
The states that share a border with Mexico — Texas, Arizona, California and New Mexico — see a stream of migrants who enter the country through the desert. Since the 1980s, hundreds of thousands of migrants each year have been caught illegally crossing the Southwestern United States, according to Border Patrol data, though the number has dropped in recent years. In 2017, Border Patrol apprehended 303,916 migrants crossing the Southwest border illegally, down from over 1 million as recently as 2006.
It’s unclear how many people die in the process, or exactly how many of their bodies are found by law enforcement agencies and individuals. But in Pima County alone, officials have 2,816 recovered remains — defined as both skeletal and fully fleshed bodies of undocumented migrants — since 2000, according to a 2017 report by the county medical examiner’s office. Last year, the country recovered 128 remains. In an interview, Greg Hess, the chief medical examiner for Pima County, told the PBS NewsHour that 113 remains have been found so far this year.
About 65 percent of the remains are later identified, Hess said. And the medical examiner’s office expects to increase its rate of identifications through continued cooperation with immigration enforcement agencies and other organizations, he added.
But 992 migrants who have died in the county in the past two decades remain unidentified, according to data from Hess’ office. Most bodies are recovered in the summer months, when migrants are more likely to travel throughout the desert. In 2017, for example, there were 20 recoveries in June, compared to four recoveries in December.
Border Patrol agents find about half of the bodies discovered in the county, Hess said. The others are discovered by local residents and ranchers like John Ladd, 63, who manages a roughly 40-square-mile cattle ranch a little more than a mile away from the U.S.-Mexico border. Ladd said he’s found 14 bodies of migrants on his ranch in the past 30 years.
“I’ve become a little more hardened to it,” Ladd said in an interview. “But it’s still an experience you don’t want to go through because it’s a dead body. It’s a human.”

Ladd remembers the details from most of the bodies he’s found. He recalled finding the body of one man in the winter who appeared to have died from hypothermia; the man was wearing only a t-shirt and a pair of Levi jeans.
“It’s a shocking event. Even the smell of it haunts you,” Ladd said. “One of the worst experiences is when the coroner got there and slid them into the body bag.” He added, “I’m a pretty tough guy but that’s a pretty big deal. It sticks with you.”
Clues left behind
The speed with which migrants are identified varies. In an interview, Jacob Stukenberg, a Border Patrol agent and community liaison for the agency, said if agents come across the remains of a migrant while doing rounds in the field, they report it to local law enforcement agencies first.
After local law enforcement officials conduct a brief investigation of the area, the medical examiner receives the remains and starts an investigation to determine the person’s identity and cause of death. Eventually, the office is able to identify the body, or determines that there isn’t enough information to do so, in which case the person is cremated and their remains are sent to a local cemetery.
Sometimes, clues left behind by a dead migrant can help the medical examiner’s office find the person’s friends or family members. Some migrants carry pieces of papers with phone numbers on them, or cell phones that can be used to call love ones, Hess said.
Hess’s medical examiner’s office also works with Mexican, El Salvadoran and Guatemalan consulates to help identify individuals. Every couple of weeks, officials from the office meet with staff from the countries’ local consulates as well as Border Patrol agents to review any remains that were found, Hess said. Officials said the cooperation helps eliminate discrepancies and verify information.
“Missing reports can become vague if they go to other non-law enforcement agencies,” said Border Patrol Agent Daniel Hernandez, another community liaison for the agency. “We have to keep everything documented, [and] we work with the consulate specifically so that we know that information is handled accurately.”
‘A broken system’
Hess acknowledged that undocumented immigrants might not reach out to Border Patrol or other immigration enforcement agencies with a missing persons report for fear of being detained or deported. For that reason, the county also works with groups like the Colibrí Center, an advocacy organization that seeks to reunite families with missing migrants.
“Law enforcement owns missing persons. If someone in your family goes missing and you haven’t heard from them and you’re worried, who would you call to look for them? The cops,” Hess said. “It’s a broken system for this group of people.”

In an interview, an immigrant living in the U.S. named Sonia, 45, recounted the terror she felt when she got a call from the coyote she had hired to bring her 14-year-old daughter into the country. The coyote — the name often used for guides who help undocumented migrants cross into the U.S. — let her know that her daughter had been left behind in the Arizona desert.
“He told me they left her behind because she had gotten very sick,” said Sonia, who asked to use only her first name because of her immigration status. “He said to call the consulates and immigration to try to find her.”
But Sonia said she was scared to reach out to officials. Instead, she relied on her sister, who is documented, to interact with authorities and post flyers around Arizona. Immigration officials looked for her daughter, but Sonia said she believes they stopped the search after a couple of days.
“I felt helpless,” Sonia said, recalling the feeling of not knowing where her daughter was. “She had called me on my birthday to tell me she was almost out and wouldn’t be able to contact me for a while. I thought she was coming to me.”
Her daughter’s body was recovered two weeks later by a humanitarian group. She had not yet decomposed, making her easier to identify. She had died of hypothermia. Sonia said that she considered herself one of the lucky ones; at least she found out what happened, and was able to recover the body.
Hernandez, one of the Border Patrol agents who was interviewed for this story, said the agency’s officials in the field do not ask questions about citizenship to individuals looking for a missing friend or relative.
“We don’t care as long as we find that person,” he said.
In the end, the odds of identifying a migrant found dead in the desert depends largely on the condition of the body when it was discovered.The Pima County medical examiner’s office has a formal system to classify the condition levels of corpses, measured on a scale of one to eight.
Level one means the body is “fully fleshed” and just recently recovered, according to the office’s annual report. Level seven is a body that is six-to-eight months post-mortem, a condition where the corpse has reached full skeletonization.
Back at the examiner’s office, as Vollner finished her report on the skeletal remains on her table, she paused to consider a simple question. Given the challenges and uncertainty, why does she keep doing this work?
“I think it’s human nature. You think about when people talk about humankind and the first burials and caring for our dead,” she said. “That’s a very sacred thing, even to those that aren’t necessarily religious or spiritual. That’s what we do as humans.”"

The three countries received a combined more than $500 million in funding from the U.S. in fiscal year 2017.
Trump has raised alarm over thousands of migrants traveling through Mexico to the U.S., saying, “Sadly, it looks like Mexico’s Police and Military are unable to stop the Caravan.”
He adds: “I have alerted Border Patrol and Military that this is a National Emergy.” White House officials could not immediately provide details."

Despite having walked the entire previous day, with swollen, blistered and aching feet, the group was up shortly after sunrise after sleeping on the ground in their clothes.
Dozens attended Mass at the Basilica in the city of Esquipulas, just across the border from Honduras and about 90 miles east of Guatemala City, to receive a blessing, before continuing the journey escorted by Guatemalan police.
The group’s numbers have snowballed since some 160 migrants departed Friday from San Pedro Sula, Honduras, with many people joining spontaneously carrying just a few belongings. A Guatemalan priest estimated that more than 2,000 had been fed at three shelters run by the Roman Catholic Church.
Three weeks before midterm elections in the United States, the caravan elicited a tough response from Trump.
“The United States has strongly informed the President of Honduras that if the large Caravan of people heading to the U.S. is not stopped and brought back to Honduras, no more money or aid will be given to Honduras, effective immediately,” Trump tweeted.
The United States has strongly informed the President of Honduras that if the large Caravan of people heading to the U.S. is not stopped and brought back to Honduras, no more money or aid will be given to Honduras, effective immediately!
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 16, 2018
However, the Central American nation’s ability to do anything at this point appeared limited as the migrants had already crossed into Guatemala on Monday, twice pushing past outnumbered police sent to stop them — first at the border and then at a roadblock outside Esquipulas.
Trump did not follow through on a similar threat to the Central American nation in April over an earlier caravan, which eventually petered out.
There was no immediate public response from the Honduran government. In late September, in a speech at the U.N. General Assembly, President Juan Orlando Hernandez defended migrants, criticizing their treatment in detention centers and the separation of children from their families — without explicitly naming the United States.
“Migration is a human right,” Hernandez said. “For centuries human beings have moved and emigrated and have contributed to the social and economic development of the nations that have taken them in, in search of better opportunities. We in Honduras and the Central American region are not an exception.”
Meanwhile, Mexico’s immigration authority sent out a fresh warning late Monday that only those who meet entry requirements would be allowed into the country and each migrant would have to satisfy Mexican migration agents. Hondurans need visas to visit Mexico in most cases.
Still, it remains unclear if Mexico and other governments in the region — many of whose own people are migrants — would have the political will to physically halt the determined border-crossers, who are fleeing widespread poverty and violence in one of the world’s most murderous countries.
“In Honduras there are no jobs, and the jobs that do exist aren’t enough to live on,” said Jose Francisco Hernandez, a 32-year-old from Copan state in western Honduras. “We can’t go to the city because it is full of gang members, and that is hurting us. We decided to migrate from the country to see if we can find a better life.”
Carlos Reyes, 20, said he was attacked a week ago for being gay and dressing in women’s clothing.
“Some men were going to kill me. … They wanted to kill me for who I am,” Reyes said.
The migrants hope that traveling en masse affords them protection from robbery, assault and other dangers that plague the journey north.
Many carried only a few belongings in backpacks and bottles of water. Some pushed strollers or carried toddlers on their shoulders.
On Monday night they bedded down wherever they could, some on the grass in a church parking lot and others on the floors of a migrant shelter and a sports hall.
Few carried food and some Esquipulas residents began to organize to help feed them. Some migrants asked for money, while others were handed bread as they passed a local bakery.
Last week, U.S. Vice President Mike Pence urged leaders in Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala to persuade their citizens to stay home and avoid the long, risky journey to the United States.
On Tuesday, Pence tweeted that he had spoken with Hernandez, the Honduran president.
“Delivered strong message from @POTUS: no more aid if caravan is not stopped. Told him U.S. will not tolerate this blatant disregard for our border & sovereignty.”
But the threat of ending aid to an unpopular government seemed unlikely to dissuade the migrants, some of whom expressed displeasure with Hernandez.
Gabriela Natareno, 27, who was traveling with her 16-year-old cousin, said her president is to blame for continued migration by desperate Hondurans.
“He keeps the country mired in poverty and corruption,” she said."

Here’s what we know,"More than 400 migrant children remain separated from their parents and under the federal government’s care, according to court documents filed this week.
In late July — the deadline set by a federal judge for the U.S.to reunite more than 2,500 migrant families separated at the southwest border — federal agents had successfully reunited more than half of affected children with their parents. Now, the number of children that remain separated as a result of the Trump administration’s “zero tolerance” policy hovers at 416, dozens fewer than reported in last week’s status update.
Amid the ongoing reunification effort for these migrant families was Thursday’s news of the Department of Homeland Security’s decision to change the longstanding Flores agreement, which requires the government to hold immigrant children in the “least restrictive setting” and generally release them after 20 days in detention.
The department announced that it would instead adopt proposed regulations that would allow the government to detain migrant families for longer periods of time. This is a move that will almost certainly invite more legal pushback from advocates.
In the meantime, here’s a closer look at how the government broke down the latest numbers and what could happen next with the family reunification process.
It’s been about two months since U.S. District Court Judge Dana Sabraw ordered the U.S. government to reunite these families. In a status update Thursday, the government said of the 2,654 separated migrant children, 2,181 have been “discharged,” meaning they were either reunified with their parents or placed with a sponsor within the U.S., among other circumstances, such as the child turning 18 years old.
As of Sept. 4, 2018, 416 children remain separated from their parents. This is about 80 children fewer than last week’s update. Of those 416 children, 14 are under age 5.
The parents of 304 children are located outside the U.S. — either because they were deported or because they sent their children to the U.S. with other family members. Both the U.S. and the American Civil Liberties Union have been focusing efforts on resolving these cases due to the difficulty in reaching the adults in their home countries. Sabraw has requested more transparency and information on this group of families, saying last week that the U.S. ought to avoid the “natural tendency to treat each person as a number.”
Here’s how the U.S. further categorizes the parents of the 416 children that remain in U.S. custody:
Comparing this breakdown with last week’s numbers, two categories have disappeared. The U.S. said a group belonging to one of the previously reported categories — children who were still under U.S. care “where further review shows they were not separated from parents by DHS” — has been determined to no longer be eligible class members in the ongoing lawsuit. The U.S. said it will provide ACLU attorneys with a “line list” of the 57 cases that remain in this group.
Another category, “adult red flag case review — parentage,” was also absorbed by the new “out-of-class” category, after a final determination found these cases did not result from separations by DHS officials.
The U.S. said in the status update that it intended by Friday to provide reasoning for any parent who has been removed as a class member from the lawsuit. These may be parents who have not yet been reunified “due to concerns related to criminal history, fitness, or danger,” the U.S. said in court documents.
ACLU said in the status update that it and its network has made “significant progress” getting in touch with separated parents, and also confirming that they wanted to be reunified with their children.
However, the organization pointed to two “red flag” cases deemed ineligible for reunification that “may require expedited attention.”
ACLU said it was “particularly concerned” about a 4-year-old whose mother was denied reunification because of an outstanding foreign warrant that says she’s a gang member. The mother has denied the allegation.
At her immigration bond hearing, “the immigration judge expressly found that this warrant was not sufficient evidence that the mother was a danger to the community.”
But because of the mother’s supposed criminal history, the U.S. has denied her reunification with her child, who was 3 years old when he was first detained, ACLU said.
“This child is suffering greatly in detention and is at particular risk of grievous and irreparable harm,” the organization wrote.
In a second case, a father was denied reunification with his 2-year-old son. The U.S. appeared to base its decision on the father’s criminal history. The ACLU said it was aware of the adult’s guilty plea for assault in 2010, but that the incident “has no bearing on his current dangerousness or ability to care for his child.”

The Department of Homeland Security announced Thursday it would terminate the agreement, which requires the government to release immigrant children generally after 20 days in detention. It would instead adopt regulations that administration officials say will provide for proper care of minors but allow for changes to deter migrants illegally crossing the U.S.-Mexico border.
The 1997 case that spawned the agreement will almost certainly land back in court. U.S. District Court Judge Dolly M. Ghee already rejected a request by administration lawyers this year to allow for longer family detention.

Here’s what we know,"Nearly 500 migrant children remain separated from their parents and under the federal government’s care, according to court documents filed this week.
The latest numbers are a slight improvement on last week’s status update on the effort to reunify migrant families who were separated at the southwest border.
Most of the 2,600-plus affected by the practice of separating children from their parents, under the Trump administration’s “zero tolerance” policy earlier this spring, have been reunited, according to the latest numbers. But more than a month after a court-ordered deadline in late July, 497 remain apart.
U.S. District Court Judge Dana Sabraw, commenting on the discrepancies among some of the numbers submitted by the government, said Friday that the U.S. ought to avoid the “natural tendency to treat each person as a number.”
Here’s how the government broke down the latest numbers and what will happen with the family reunification process next.
In a status update Thursday, the federal government said of the total 2,654 separated migrant children, 2,157 have been “discharged.” That’s 31 more children since last week who were either reunified with their parents or placed with a sponsor within the U.S., among other circumstances, such as a child turning 18 years old.
As of Aug. 27, 2018, 497 children remain separated from their parents. Of that same group, 22 children are under age 5. That’s one fewer child than last week.
Parents of 322 children are located outside of the U.S., according to the documents. Of this group, six children are under age 5.
In the past several weeks, the federal government and the American Civil Liberties Union have been making these cases a priority in the reunification effort, launching an outreach plan to connect with parents in their home countries.
Of the children who remain separated from their parents:
In Friday’s hearing, U.S. District Court Judge Dana Sabraw said the reunification effort “continues to look encouraging.”
The judge zeroed in on the discrepancy between the ACLU and the U.S. government’s separate estimates for the number of parents who are no longer in the U.S. who were called and not successfully reached. The ACLU said that number was 80. The U.S. said it was 4. The judge asked why there was such a stark contrast.
“When I read these numbers, they’re numbers. They’re digits,” Judge Sabraw said Friday. “It’s hard for me to understand what causes the difference” among the numbers.
“I’d want to know what person is behind the number,” the judge added, saying that there’s a need to make sure there’s real clarity and precision in keeping track of every person in this group of adults outside the U.S.
The effort to reach these adults has including working with the governments of their home countries to put up hotline numbers on public notices and billboards, hoping to get the attention of these parents.
Attorneys for the U.S. government said it was possible some of the information from the ACLU and its network could be dated and a “little more stale” than the government’s because the U.S. has been in contact with these families for a longer period of time.
Both parties agreed to meet and confer to lessen the discrepancy among their numbers. The judge agreed with the ACLU that the government should provide better identifiers — like a name — attached to these numbers.
What’s next?
The court update follows allegations from the government of El Salvador that three young migrants were abused at unspecified shelters in Arizona.
“They are sexual violations, sexual abuses, that is what this is about,” Liduvina Magarin, deputy foreign relations minister for El Salvador, told reporters Thursday, adding that the three children are between the ages of 12 to 17. Magarin has asked the U.S. to expedite their reunification “as soon as possible.”
Both the government and the ACLU are expected to continue providing numbers in court next week.

The numbers only improved slightly from what the federal government reported last week.
It’s been nearly a month since the court-imposed deadline for the Trump administration to reunify all migrant families that were separated as part of its “zero tolerance” policy earlier this spring. The administration was expected to reunify more than 2,600 migrant children, age 0-17, with their parents by July 26. The government blew past that deadline, with more than 1,600 children remaining separated when the date passed.
The numbers come from the latest weekly, court-imposed update on where the government stands on the family reunification effort.
U.S. District Court Judge Dana Sabraw said Friday that the latest report from the combined efforts of the American Civil Liberties Union and the federal government look to be “very encouraging.”
Here’s how the government broke down the latest numbers and how the family reunification process will continue.
In a status update Thursday, the federal government said of the total 2,654 separated migrant children, 2,126 have been “discharged.” This means the children were either reunified with their parents or placed with a government-approved sponsor within the U.S., among other circumstances, such as a child turning 18 years old.
As of Aug. 20, 2018, 528 children remained separated from their parents. Of those, 23 children are under age 5. This amounts to little improvement from last week’s numbers: 565 total children in U.S. custody, including 24 under age 5. It demonstrates how slow the process has been, especially for the migrant parents who were no longer in the U.S.
Also notable: There are 343 children whose parents are no longer in the U.S. These are parents who have already been deported by immigration officials or left the U.S. voluntarily. Of this group, six children are under age 5. The federal government and the ACLU have focused their most recent efforts in reaching these parents in their home countries.
Here’s how the U.S. further categorizes the parents of the 528 children that remain in U.S. custody:
“It seems like we’re on a very good trajectory here,” Judge Sabraw said in Friday’s hearing.

Both parties are expected to continue providing numbers to the court next week.

The superintendent reached out and agreed to send 19 bilingual teachers, mobile classrooms and hundreds of computers to make the learning environment resemble one of his schools.
While a government contractor bears responsibility for educating children at the highly guarded center, local officials say they stepped up partly because of a law that calls on school systems to educate any child, anywhere within their district.
“This is not a political issue. This is not a racial issue. This is a moral obligation, and actually our legal obligation,” said Michael Vargas, who leads the board of the San Benito Consolidated Independent School District.
San Benito is one of a small number of U.S. school systems that are preparing for the first day of school on both their public campuses and in new classrooms set up at nearby federal youth migrant shelters. In neighboring Brownsville, Texas, the superintendent is working on an agreement to deploy teachers and services to help educate 800 children housed in federal facilities in her district.

The school systems are pitching in amid an outcry over the separation of children from their parents at the U.S.-Mexico border under the Trump administration’s zero-tolerance policy for illegal immigration. Several hundred children remain separated from their parents, but most of the thousands of young people held in federal shelters across the U.S. are unaccompanied minors who arrived in the country without their families.
The Associated Press inquired with public school districts in 61 cities nationwide where shelters are known to exist within their boundaries. Among the 50 that responded, most said they had no contact with the shelter or federal program authorities. Some outside the border states, including Camden, New Jersey, said they only recently discovered the existence of migrant shelters in their community.
Many noted they would educate all children regardless of immigration status, as required by law, if their families or legal guardians sought enrollment on their campuses.
“Until this becomes a real-time issue for us, we have no official position,” said Superintendent Dennis Blauser of the Oracle, Arizona, school district.
In Texas, some districts already had longstanding agreements to run classrooms with public school teachers at migrant shelters.
By law, the federal contractors that operate the shelters are required to have a “care provider” give children six hours a day of structured learning time.

Southwest Key, the largest contractor operating such facilities, has agreements with two school districts, including San Benito. It is also working to create partnerships with the Brownsville Independent School District and with a charter school network run separately by Southwest Key’s parent organization.
Salvador Cavazos, Southwest Key’s vice president of educational services, said the nonprofit shelter operator has for years offered great basic services but is now welcoming more help from outside school systems as an enhancement as the number of children in its care grows.
He said Southwest Key gets appreciative feedback from families after the average 30- to 45-day stay for each child, and most students leave with some level of academic gain. He said the children do “a lot of good work” studying through a project-based curriculum that is aligned with state standards.
“They do history projects. They do class presentations. They do read-alouds with the books and novels that they’re reading,” said Cavazos, a former school teacher and administrator.
The districts’ role is largely limited to their regular school year, though the shelters also provide supplemental curriculum during summer months.
Rochelle Garza, a Brownsville, Texas-based attorney who advocates for the children in court said the students can be detained for a semester or more with repeating instruction as other kids cycle in and out.
Brownsville Superintendent Esperanza Zendejas said she felt a responsibility to honor the spirit of a 1982 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that affirmed all children in the United States are entitled to enroll in their local public school district for a free education.
Zendejas said the district also has an obligation to work around the troubling circumstances of such a vulnerable population of children, just as the law enforces for homeless children. She said her school district is well-equipped and willing to handle the important task, and ready to provide teachers and special education, bilingual and support services.
“The question of who gets educated in our country is coming up and my belief is everybody should receive an education if you are in this country,” Zendejas said.
But Thomas Saenz, president of the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, said the children should be released from custody and be allowed to learn at public school campuses instead of the schools creating an inadequate experience within the confines of the shelter.
“It’s not a time for amateurs, and some school districts are frankly amateurs in dealing with short-term incarcerated youth after trauma” from family separation, Saenz said.
The San Benito school district’s agreement with Southwest Key, signed in May, is modeled on a similar arrangement in Harlingen, Texas. It gives the district control of curriculum and instruction, while Southwest Key has responsibilities that typically would fall to a guardian, including getting the children ready for school. It also requires facility staff to assist in the classrooms and intervene in the event of a crisis.
The district said it will recoup its costs for the teachers and the 570 Chromebooks and laptops on the federally contracted sites by counting those children as part of its official enrollment. The district expects that will bring in about $2.8 million in state funding.
Still, there has been some blowback from critics over a school district that in recent years struggled financially. Vargas, of the San Benito district board, said he was confronted with unexpected hostility by some in the impoverished border town who fear the plan will syphon resources from their own schools.
“I would hear it from other people going to church: ‘Why are we going to help — insert derogatory term — kids?'” he said.
The Texas Education Agency has said local school districts intervening would be doing so voluntarily because the legal obligation to provide educational services to children in federal detention lies with the federal government.
Cavazos said Southwest Key’s ultimate goal is to help the children transition into a regular classroom environment so they can continue their education.
“I would hope that they are able to thrive in the communities that they end up (in), even if it is their home country,” he said."

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials said the man was detained because he was wanted on an outstanding arrest warrant in a homicide case in Mexico.
Maria del Carmen Venegas said she and her husband, Joel Arrona Lara, were driving to the hospital Wednesday when they stopped for gas in San Bernardino, just east of Los Angeles.
Surveillance footage shows two vehicles immediately flank the couple’s van after they pulled into the gas station. Agents with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement questioned the couple and asked for identification, Venegas said.
Venegas, 32, said she provided hers but that Arrona had left his at home in their rush to the hospital. The surveillance footage shows the agents handcuffing the 35-year-old Arrona and taking him away, leaving a sobbing Venegas alone at the gas station.
Venegas said she drove herself to the hospital for a scheduled cesarean section for the birth of her fifth child.
“I feel terrible,” Venegas said in a telephone interview from the hospital as her newborn son Damian cried in the background.
“We need him now more than ever,” she said.
Venegas said she and her husband came to the U.S. 12 years ago from the city of Leon in the central Mexican state of Guanajuato. They do not have legal authorization to live in the U.S., and all five of their children are U.S. citizens, she said.
Venegas said her husband is a hard worker and the sole provider of the family.

In a statement issued Saturday afternoon, Immigration and Custom Enforcement said Arrona “was brought to ICE’s attention due to an outstanding warrant issued for his arrest in Mexico on homicide charges,” spokeswoman Lori Haley said.
ICE said agents with the agency’s Fugitive Operations Team detained Arrona on Wednesday and said he remained in custody pending removal proceedings.
Though the team prioritizes arresting immigrants who are transnational gang members, child sex offenders and those who’ve had previous convictions for violent crimes, the agency’s statement said it “will no longer exempt classes or categories of removable aliens from potential enforcement.”
“All of those in violation of the immigration laws may be subject to immigration arrest, detention and, if found removable by final order, removal from the United States,” the statement said.
Emilio Amaya Garcia, director of the San Bernardino Community Service Center, said his nonprofit group is providing legal help to Venegas and Arrona, will file a motion on Monday for an immigration court to set a bail hearing for Arrona and will ask that his removal proceedings be canceled.
Garcia did not respond to messages and calls for comment about the arrest warrant in Mexico."

In the past six years, more than 200,000 unaccompanied migrant children have entered the U.S. and been placed into the “UAC” program. Both the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Health and Human Services administer the children’s placement program — detaining kids at the border, housing them in shelters and screening adult “sponsors” to care for them as they await their immigration court proceedings.
Since 2015, however, the agencies have been criticized for their lack in oversight of the children once they are placed with sponsors.
A report by the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs subcommittee on investigations released Wednesday is the latest to call out the program’s deficiencies and describe how the agencies’ lack of progress in addressing them has put migrant children at risk of trafficking and abuse.
The report comes four months after a Senate hearing revealed Health and Human Services lost track of nearly 1,500 unaccompanied migrant children. After placing the children with sponsors, who are usually parents or family members but in some cases unrelated adults, the agency made no efforts other than a one-time phone call to check on their well-being.
The report also reiterates concerns raised back in 2015, when the subcommittee learned Health and Human Services had not properly vetted sponsors and released eight migrant children to human traffickers. The children were forced to work 12 hours a day on an egg farm in Marion, Ohio.
Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, who chairs the subcommittee, said in a statement the two agencies were provided a road map for addressing these problems more than two years ago, but “largely ignored those recommendations.”
Among the issues highlighted by the report:
For months, Senators have waited on an outline from Homeland Security and Health and Human Services that defines their responsibilities for ensuring the children’s safety. The subcommittee received the outline on July 31st, more than 17 months overdue. But, according to the report, it is “largely a recitation of the status quo, and does little to offer hope that federal agencies are working effectively” to improve the program.
Sen. Portman has said many problems began during the Obama administration. But the report says President Donald Trump’s zero tolerance policy has burdened the AUC program. More than 2,500 children were separated at the border in May and June, as their parents were referred for prosecution. Children separated from their parents were rendered UACs and transferred to the custody of Health and Human Services.
According to the report, Health and Human services officials said the additional housing and processing efforts to reunite children with their families in recent weeks have “stretched thin its already-limited resources for the UAC program.”
Both agencies and the Department of Justice have called the report “misleading” and have said it “demonstrates a fundamental misunderstanding of law and policy,” the Washington Post reported.

“I think a lot of people don’t understand how much worse it can actually be for people when they are pushed back” to their home countries, said Christopher Tidey, a communication specialist for the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) and a lead author on this latest report. “It’s not just as simple as going home,” he added.
The UNICEF report said the children decide to make the journey north to Mexico and the U.S. from northern Central America — specifically, El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras, where gangs have virtually taken over as the local authority. Their daily lives are marked by poverty and a lack of social services.
These same conditions are intensified and new problems can develop once the U.S. and Mexico decides to deport them, UNICEF said in its report, which includes summaries of interviews it conducted with migrant families.
That migrant children could face worsened conditions upon their forced return isn’t a new idea. But it’s one that could be neglected when it comes to coverage of the region or policy proposals in dealing with the crisis, Tidey told the PBS NewsHour.
Here’s a closer look at the agency’s findings:
Between January and June of this year, UNICEF said more than 96,000 migrants, including more than 24,000 women and children, returned to their home countries after being deported from Mexico and the U.S. And that number appears to be growing, aided in part by the increased cooperation between Mexico and the U.S. under the Southern Border Plan, launched in 2014 to strengthen border security and apprehensions along Mexico’s border with Guatemala.
The majority of migrant children are being pushed back to their home countries from Mexico, in part because of the Southern Border Plan, Tidey said.
Family reunification is another motivating factor for why migrant children leave their home countries. UNICEF cited a 2016 survey that found nearly 32 percent of migrant children who were deported back to their home country of Honduras said reunification with family who had already made the journey north was the main reason for fleeing their home. Of those who were returned to El Salvador, 28 percent said family reunification was their main motivating factor, according to a separate 2018 survey.
UNICEF interviews with migrant children also pointed to lasting emotional and psychological trauma resulting from their failed trips north.
A Honduran teenager, identified in the UNICEF report as Eric, recounted how he and his mother attempted to reach the U.S. about nine years ago, hoping for better living conditions. Along the way, they were stopped at a police roadblock, where he was held at gunpoint. He and his mother were detained together in a jail for four months before they were finally deported back to Honduras.
They were penniless, said Eric, 18; they sold all of their belongings to help pay for their initial trip. Eric’s mother eventually left Honduras again to look for work, leaving the teen to look after his younger sister.
“You are a little boy, but you don’t have the mind of child. You have the mind of an adult because of all these events,” Eric recalled his mother telling him, before she left again.
Eric told UNICEF he’s had psychological problems from the stress of the situation, describing himself as “aloof.” “Those problems made me a lonely boy because I had to think like a grown-up,” he added.

UNICEF’s report said the detention or separation of migrant families by immigration forces are “deeply traumatizing experiences” that can affect a child’s development in the long run.
Dr. Colleen Kraft, president of the American Academy of Pediatrics, said “the relationship with a loving parent or primary caregiver is critical to a child’s sense of self and safety.” The younger the child, the more critical this is, she said.
More than 2,500 migrant children were separated from their parents at the U.S.-Mexico border as the Trump administration pushed its “zero-tolerance” policy this spring. The practice of separating children from their parents was subsequently halted by an executive order. Since then, hundreds of children remain separated from their parents, amid a legal battle between the U.S. government and the American Civil Liberties Union to reunify all those affected by the administration’s crackdown.
When a young girl named Sofi and her grandmother came legally to a U.S. immigration checkpoint, they tried to apply for asylum but were separated by U.S. officials. After 47 days, their story took a happier turn last week in California. Amna Nawaz joins William Brangham to share an update.
“Even with older children, separation from parents or primary caregivers is one of the most potent traumatic stressors that a child can experience, especially if this happens under frightening or sudden or chaotic or prolonged circumstances,” Kraft said.
These type of separations, regardless of where they occur along the children’s journey, can increase the child’s risk for developing depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress symptoms or other traumatic reactions, she added.
Among other calls for action in its report, UNICEF said there needs to be investments from Mexico, the U.S. and other governments into the economies of these affected countries. That also includes investing in education and having systems in place so that migrant children are not compelled to uproot and journey north or move elsewhere within the region.
UNICEF also called for alternatives to the detention of migrant families by Mexican and U.S. officials and an end to the practice in both countries.

The expulsions to the desert borders that Algeria shares with Niger and Mali have all but ended since The Associated Press reported less than three weeks ago that more than 13,000 people, including women and children, had been dropped off in the stark, dangerous region since May 2017, according to officials with the U.N.’s International Organization for Migration.
Before the AP reached out to Algeria for comment and published the report on June 26, the North African nation was expelling migrants by the hundreds almost every week into the unforgiving desert, sometimes to their deaths.
Algeria has refused repeated AP requests for comment on the expulsions.
The European Union also declined to comment. The expulsions came as Europe is pressuring North African governments to head off the migrants before they can cross the Mediterranean Sea.
An aid worker with contacts in Algeria told the AP that the mass detentions continue, but now migrants, including dozens of pregnant women, are warehoused in overcrowded jails. The worker requested anonymity to avoid retribution from the Algerian government.
Algeria also continues to deport migrants from neighboring Niger, with which it has had an expulsion agreement since 2015. But while migrants from other sub-Saharan countries were dropped in the desert secretly and forced to walk for miles under the blistering sun, the Nigeriens have long been driven to the border by convoys. After the AP report in June, Algerian officials invited local media to watch such a round of deportations to prove they were humanely done.
Since the AP report, Algeria’s security forces have fallen into disarray, with the head of the gendarmerie and the chief of national security both being forced from their jobs. It is unclear why the men were fired, but both were linked to the migrant expulsions in the desert as well as to an unrelated corruption scandal involving the seizure of more than 700 kilograms (1,550 pounds) of cocaine from a cargo ship in May.
In its few public statements, Algeria has insisted that migrants are treated appropriately, but the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights has condemned the expulsions in the desert. Two days after the AP report, Human Rights Watch also released an investigation into the forced desert marches.
“Algeria has the power to control its borders, but that doesn’t mean it can round up people based on the color of their skin and dump them in the desert, regardless of their legal status and without a shred of due process,” Sarah Leah Whitson of Human Rights Watch said in a statement.
Migrants filmed videos of themselves fanning out across the open desert, stumbling through heat that reaches above 50 degrees Centigrade (122 degrees Fahrenheit) in summer as Algerian gendarmes with guns ensured they did not turn back. Of the more than two dozen migrants who AP journalists interviewed in Niger, nearly all reported seeing deaths during the forced march, which sometimes lasted days.
Even before the AP report, the conditions that migrants were enduring in the Sahara Desert had been an open secret among aid workers as well as governments in Africa and Europe. The African Union had already complained about Algeria’s policies toward migrants in a statement in May.
“We cannot accept African countries ill-treating Africans, even if they enter the country illegally,” the chairman of the AU Commission, Moussa Faki Mahamat, said this week in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.
European Union officials say they discussed the desert expulsions with Algerian government officials privately in recent months, but the EU nonetheless settled upon Algeria as one of a handful of countries where it had hoped to set up centers to sort economic migrants from asylum-seekers fleeing for their lives. Algeria refused the dubious honor, as did multiple other countries.

U.S. District Judge Dolly Gee said the federal government had failed to present new evidence to support revising a court order that limits detaining children who crossed the border illegally for extended periods.
The Department of Justice asked Gee to alter a 1997 settlement, which provides the framework for how to handle detained immigrant children, so it could detain families together for longer periods.
The Trump administration said Gee’s previous rulings had made family detention unlikely and provided an incentive for a surge of immigrants to bring children across the border illegally with the expectation they wouldn’t be locked up.
Gee called the administration’s request “a cynical attempt” to shift responsibility to the court “for over 20 years of Congressional inaction and ill-considered executive action that have led to the current stalemate.”

Three years ago, Gee rejected a similar effort by the Obama administration. She ruled at the time that immigrant children generally can’t be held longer than 20 days.
More than 2,000 children were separated from their parents by U.S. immigration authorities at the border with Mexico this spring before President Donald Trump reversed course on June 20 amid an international outcry.
The application to change the Flores agreement — named for an El Salvador immigrant who was 15 when the case was brought in 1985 — was “procedurally improper and wholly without merit,” said Gee, who was nominated to the court by President Barack Obama.
The Department of Justice was reviewing Monday’s ruling and did not say if it would appeal.
“We disagree with the court’s ruling declining to amend the Flores Agreement to recognize the current crisis of families making the dangerous and unlawful journey across our southern border,” spokesman Devin O’Malley said in a statement.
Families can be detained together if their parents waive their right to release children to the custody of a family member.
Attorney Peter Schey, who represents detained children in the settlement, said President Donald Trump had falsely claimed the settlement required the separation of families.
“Sifting through the government’s false narrative, the court clearly found that the Flores settlement has never resulted in the separation of families,” Schey said. “President Trump needs to take responsibility for his own misguided policies.”
The ruling came the same day the government acknowledged it would not meet a Tuesday deadline set by a San Diego federal judge who ordered detained children under 5 to be reunited with their families.
Justice Department lawyer Sarah Fabian said 54 of the 100 or so infants and toddlers covered by the order would be reunited on time. She said the delay for others was due to a variety of reasons, including that the parents of some of the youngsters had already been deported.
U.S. District Judge Dana Sabraw, a nominee of Republican President George W. Bush, set a July 26 deadline to reunite all the children separated from their parents.
The government had claimed in its filings that Sabraw’s ruling trumped the Flores agreement. Gee rejected that argument on several grounds, saying the U.S. was relying on a “tortured interpretation” of the deal.

“Hello!” said the first lady, brightening amid the semicircle of eight cells in a short-term holding center for migrants. “How are you?”
Mrs. Trump, an immigrant and a mother herself, wanted to find out more about how her husband’s strict immigration policy was playing out on the ground, especially among families that have been separated at the border. Two tours of migrant detention centers in a week gave her a sometimes grim view.
Now the question is what she does with that knowledge — and how she meshes it with her dislike for dividing up families and a concurrent belief in strong borders.
Spokeswoman Stephanie Grisham says more border visits or talks with lawmakers are possible, but it’s not clear what lessons the first lady took from her visits and what she’ll communicate to her husband.
“She cares about children deeply,” Grisham said. “She also believes in strong border laws and treating everybody equally.”
The first lady has given her husband her views on controversial political issues throughout his presidency, but never in such a public way as with the issue of immigrant children.
Before her husband reversed himself and put a halt to separations at the border, Mrs. Trump’s office put out a statement saying the first lady “hates” to see families separated and expressing hope that “both sides of the aisle” can reform the nation’s immigration laws. She did not say whether she supports the president’s “zero tolerance” policy for criminally prosecuting those who cross the border illegally.
“This is a complex issue,” Grisham said. “She recognizes that.”

The sights and sounds of Mrs. Trump’s visits to border facilities in Texas and Arizona amounted to a hard-to-forget information file about the 2,000 children separated from their families nationally.

Thursday’s visits to a migrant center and a school provided Mrs. Trump with indelible images and facts on the perils for families crossing the desert, the challenges for law enforcement and what happens to illegal border crossers and their children when they are caught.
Despite the camera-ready nature of the events, some of the images were bleak: a cell block, doors open at the time, where minors are sorted into “Families,” ″Males” and “Processed” and “Unprocessed.” Six expressionless teenage boys seated on a bench outside their cell. A daycare for children under 2 and a few mothers — also minors.
At a Tucson roundtable with law enforcement officials responsible for hundreds of miles of border, the first lady asked how many children cross the desert alone. One official told her a 16-year-old was raped on her journey into the U.S. and gave birth in federal custody.
Rodolpho Karisch, chief patrol agent for the Tucson Sector Border Patrol, showed Mrs. Trump a picture that appeared to take her aback. He said it represented a 6-year-old boy crossing the desert alone with a soda bottle and a note. Reporters later learned that the boy is alive.
The first lady at times deliberately leaves her message unclear.

On her second visit, her wardrobe was understated. But Mrs. Trump didn’t expound on her view of her husband’s immigration policy.
That didn’t stop critics of the Trump administration from lumping her in with her husband.
In Phoenix, as the first lady’s motorcade approached a sprawling Southwest Key migrant facility, protesters lined the sidewalk amid a big inflatable likeness of her husband, dressed in a white robe and holding a hood reminiscent of the Ku Klux Klan.
“Melania Trump is guilty, guilty, guilty!” the protesters chanted of the first lady, who is from Slovenia and came to the United States on a special visa during her modeling career.
Inside, she stopped at an air-conditioned trailer marked No. 4 that held 10 boys and girls around 5 years old.
“Do you like it here with some friends?” Mrs. Trump asked.
“Si,” said one girl.
A few protesters screamed from a nearby balcony that overlooked the compound’s playground as Mrs. Trump’s retinue shifted buildings.
Then came perhaps the most sobering stop, to another cooled room containing nine babies and toddlers, and four of their moms.
Mrs. Trump stepped onto the carpet in her sneakered feet and squatted down to get closer to the children, still sleepy from recent naps. She glanced up toward the women standing nearby and asked, “Who are the moms?” One woman from Honduras raised a hand. “Where is your baby?” the first lady asked. A translator helped the young woman point out a boy, 14 months old. An official traveling with Mrs. Trump said there were 121 children there and their average stay was 48 days.
The balcony was empty by the time Mrs. Trump departed.
At the gates of the compound, some protesters tried briefly to jog alongside the first lady’s motorcade as it sped, lights flashing, toward the airport and the four-hour flight back to Washington.

https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/white-house-faces-hard-deadline-on-reunited-migrant-families,migrant,712,2018-06-27T11:57:42-04:00,"Elliot Spagat, Associated Press",White House faces hard deadline on reunited migrant families,"MCALLEN, Texas — The clock is ticking for the Trump administration after a federal judge ordered the thousands of migrant children and parents who were forcibly separated at the Mexican border reunited within 30 days, sooner for youngsters under 5.
The hard deadline was set Tuesday night by U.S. District Judge Dana Sabraw in San Diego after President Donald Trump’s order ending his policy of separating families gave way to days of uncertainty, conflicting information and no word from the administration on when parents might see their children again.
“This situation has reached a crisis level,” Sabraw wrote.
The ruling poses a host of logistical problems for the administration, and it was unclear how it would meet the deadline.
Health and Human Services, which is in charge of the children, referred questions to the Justice Department.
The Justice Department said the ruling makes it “even more imperative that Congress finally act to give federal law enforcement the ability to simultaneously enforce the law and keep families together.”
“Without this action by Congress, lawlessness at the border will continue,” the department said.
Sabraw, an appointee of Republican President George W. Bush, said children under 5 must reunited with their parents within 14 days.
He also issued a nationwide injunction against further family separations, unless the parent is deemed unfit or doesn’t want to be with the child, and ordered the government to provide phone contact between parents and their children within 10 days.
The case was brought by the American Civil Liberties Union, which sued in March on behalf of a 7-year-old girl who was separated from her Congolese mother and a 14-year-old boy who was taken from his Brazilian mother.
“Tears will be flowing in detention centers across the country when the families learn they will be reunited,” said ACLU attorney Lee Gelernt.
More than 2,000 children have been separated from their parents in recent weeks and placed in government-contracted shelters — hundreds of miles away, in some cases — under a “zero tolerance” policy toward families caught illegally entering the U.S. Many are from drug- and violence-wracked Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador.
Amid an international outcry, Trump last week issued an executive order to stop the separation of families and said parents and children will instead be detained together.
But parents already separated from their children were left in the dark on when and how they would be reunited, and Homeland Security seemed only to sow more confusion over the weekend.
“The facts set forth before the Court portray reactive governance — responses to address a chaotic circumstance of the Government’s own making,” Sabraw wrote. “They belie measured and ordered governance, which is central to the concept of due process enshrined in our Constitution.”
Since Trump issued the executive order, the administration has been casting about for detention space for holding families together and has asked the courts to modify a 1997 settlement that generally bars the government from keeping children locked up with their parents for more than 20 days.
The task ahead could be monumental: Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar told Congress on Tuesday that his department still has custody of 2,047 immigrant children separated from their parents at the border — only six fewer than last Wednesday.
Democratic senators said that wasn’t nearly enough progress.
Under questioning, Azar refused to be pinned down on how long it will take to reunite families. He said his department does extensive vetting of parents to make sure they are not traffickers masquerading as parents.
Also challenging will be the requirement the judge set on phone contact.
At a Texas detention facility near Los Fresnos, immigrant advocates complained that parents have gotten busy signals or no answer from a 1-800 number set up by federal authorities to get information about their children.
“The U.S. government never had any plan to reunite these families that were separated,” Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg of the Legal Aid Justice Center in Virginia said Tuesday. The government is now “scrambling to undo this terrible thing that they have done.”

Mattis said he could not confirm specifics, such as the number of migrants to be sheltered at Fort Bliss and Goodfellow Air Force Base. He spoke to reporters in Alaska alongside Sen. Dan Sullivan, an Alaska Republican.
“We’ll provide whatever support the Department of Homeland Security needs in order to house the people that they have under their custody,” Mattis said. “We will work that out week by week, the numbers obviously are dynamic so we will have to stay flexible in our logistics support.”
Mattis was in Alaska to visit Fort Greely, where the U.S. military maintains an arsenal of missiles designed to shoot down long-range ballistic missiles. Afterward he was heading to Beijing and then to Tokyo and Seoul.
The U.S. military has a long history of providing logistical support to people “escaping tyranny” or affected by natural disasters, Mattis said, explaining he recognized the “political aspects” of the situation along the southern border of the U.S.
“We provide logistics support and we’re not going to get into the political aspect,” he said. “Providing housing, shelter for those who need it is a legitimate governmental function.”
The number of detained migrants who might be held at Bliss and Goodfellow has not been announced, but the Pentagon had said last week that it had been asked to be prepared to shelter as many as 20,000 unaccompanied children.
One official said unaccompanied children detained after crossing the U.S. border would be sheltered at one of the bases — Bliss or Goodfellow — and the other base would house families of migrant detainees. Under the arrangement, the Defense Department would provide the land but the operations would be run by other agencies."

Such planning is standard procedure for the Pentagon.

WATCH: What asylum-seekers meet when they try to cross legally
It was first reported by The Washington Post.
It’s unclear which military bases would be used to house the children. HHS has assessed four military bases as prospective housing for child migrants.
Three are in Texas: Fort Bliss, Goodfellow Air Force Base and Dyess Air Force Base. The fourth is Little Rock Air Force Base in Arkansas. It’s not clear whether other bases are under consideration.
The prospect of the U.S. government housing up to 20,000 migrant children on military bases has raised questions on Capitol Hill.
Sen. Chuck Schumer said Thursday that he wants to know how many children are already being held after illegally crossing the U.S.-Mexico border and in what conditions.

Schumer asked why reporters haven’t been allowed to tour detention facilities and how the new plan would work. The New York Democrat also wondered how the Trump administration was keeping track of families separated under its “zero tolerance” policy on illegal border crossings."

The first lady’s stop at Upbring New Hope Children’s Center in McAllen came the morning after President Donald Trump signed an executive order halting the practice of separating these families. She may also visit a second facility later in the day where children housed in cages were seen by The Associated Press last week. Trump had come under pressure to stop the practice, including from GOP allies and the first lady herself, following a public outcry sparked by widespread images of children held in fence-like structures.

The trip was intended to lend support to those children who remain separated from their parents, said Stephanie Grisham, the first lady’s spokeswoman.
“She wanted to see everything for herself,” Grisham said.
The president had insisted incorrectly that his administration had no choice but to separate families apprehended at the border because children cannot go to jail with adults who are being criminally prosecuted for crossing the border illegally. Trump had said only Congress could fix the problem and he specifically pointed a finger at Democrats.
He reversed course Wednesday by signing the order ending separations and keeping families together when they are in custody, at least for the next few weeks. The administration’s “zero-tolerance” policy of criminally prosecuting illegal border-crossers, which has led to the removal of some 2,300 children from their parents since May, remains.
Accompanied by Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar, Mrs. Trump met with the executive director of the facility and other staff in a makeshift conference room where she was told the staff treated the 58 children housed there as if they were their own.
The first lady asked that the children be reunited with their families “as quickly as possible.”

The trip came together within the past 48 hours, Grisham said.
“She told her staff she wanted to go and we made that happen,” she said.
Trump, speaking at a Cabinet meeting, said that his wife was “down at the border,'” and Grisham said that the first lady had the full backing of her husband.
“She told him ‘I am headed down to Texas’ and he was supportive.”
Mrs. Trump, whose focus as first lady is on child well-being, appears to have been among those pushing her husband to act.
Grisham released a statement last weekend saying the first lady “hates” to see children separated from their families and “believes we need to be a country that follows all laws, but also a country that governs with heart.”
READ MORE: Trump’s full executive order on family separation
Hours before Trump used his executive order to halt family separations, a White House official let it be known that Mrs. Trump had been voicing her opinion to the president for some time, including that he needed to help families stay together. The official refused to be identified discussing Trump’s private conversations with his wife.
Trump acknowledged Wednesday that the mother of his 12-year-old son, Barron, had been prodding him.
“My wife feels very strongly about it,” he told reporters after he signed the order.
The pair of statements from the first lady amounted to an unusual public intervention by Mrs. Trump into a policy debate. Her four former living predecessors, seemingly encouraged after Laura Bush authored a scathing opinion piece, followed with sharper commentary of their own condemning the family separations as shameful.
The last-minute trip to Texas marks the first public action by Mrs. Trump since she announced in May an initiative named “Be Best” to focus on the overall well-being of children and help teach them kindness. She had been expected to travel to promote the campaign but was sidelined a week after the announcement following surgery to treat a benign kidney condition."

The CEOs of both airlines said that the administration’s recent immigration policy of separating migrant families conflicts with their values.
“We have no desire to be associated with separating families, or worse, to profit from it,” American Airlines CEO Doug Parker said in a statement.
United issued a statement in which CEO Oscar Munoz said the company’s purpose is to connect people. “This policy and its impact on thousands of children is in deep conflict with that mission and we want no part of it,” he said.
President Donald Trump told reporters he would sign an executive order Wednesday to end the practice of separating children from families after they are detained crossing the border illegally.
Since the White House announced a “zero-tolerance” policy toward undocumented migrants in early May, more than 2,300 children have been taken from their parents at the U.S.-Mexico border, leading to a spike in the number of young children under government care.
Both Parker and Munoz said they do not know whether any migrant children have been on their flights. In recent days several flight attendants have gone on social media to report seeing groups of children on their flights whom they believed to be children separated from their migrant families.
Many airlines have contracts to provide travel services to the U.S. government. Parker said, however, that the government doesn’t provide information about the passengers or their reason for travel.

The rescue service says its patrol craft reached nine different boats carrying migrants that had left from African shores throughout Saturday and early Sunday.
One boat found Sunday was carrying four dead bodies along with 49 migrants. The rescue service said the cause of death has yet to be determined.
Driven by violent conflicts and extreme poverty, tens of thousands of migrants attempt to reach southern Europe each year by crossing the Mediterranean in smugglers’ boats. Most of the boats are unfit for open water, and thousands drown annually.
The U.N. says at least 785 migrants have died crossing the Mediterranean so far this year. Through the first five months of 2018, a total of 27,482 migrants reached European shores, with 7,614 of them arriving in Spain.
Further to the east, Libya’s coast guard intercepted 152 migrants, including women and children, in the Mediterranean Sea, from two boats stopped Saturday off the coast of the western Zuwara district and the capital, Tripoli.
The migrants were taken to a naval base in Tripoli.
Libya was plunged into chaos following a 2011 uprising and is now split between rival governments in the east and west. The lawless in Libya has made it a popular place to head off to Europe for migrants fleeing poverty and conflict."

“Bravo,” Macron said to 22-year-old Mamoudou Gassama during a meeting in a gilded room of the presidential Elysee Palace where Gassama also received a gold medal from the French state for “courage and devotion.”
Gassama climbed five stories up the apartment building, moving from balcony to balcony, and whisked a 4-year-old boy to safety on Saturday night as a crowd below screamed. His actions went viral on social media, where he was dubbed “Spiderman.”
Gassama said he has authorization to stay legally in Italy, which is where he landed in Europe in 2014 after a more than a year in Libya and a trip across the Mediterranean Sea. He came to France in September to join his older brother, who has lived in France for decades.
Dressed in tattered blue jeans and white shirt, the young man recounted for the president what took place after he and some friends saw a young child hanging from a fifth-floor balcony.
“I ran. I crossed the street to save him,” Gassama told Macron. He said he didn’t think twice. “When I started to climb, it gave me courage to keep climbing.”
God “helped me,” too, he said. “Thank God I saved him.”
Gassama said he trembled with fear only after he had reached the boy, gotten him safely back over the balcony railing and taken him inside the apartment.
The father of the child was detained overnight for alleged parental neglect, and is to appear in court in September. He left the child alone while he shopped, then lingered to play Pokemon Go, Prosecutor Francois Molins told BFM-TV. The whereabouts of the child’s mother were unclear.
“You saved a child. Without you, no one knows what would have become of him,” the president said. “You need courage and the capability to do that.”
Macron offered to begin the naturalization process to make Gassama a French citizen and said, “Because this is an exceptional act … we are obviously, today, going to regularize all your papers.”
Macron is behind a bill toughening French immigration law, and he stressed there is no contradiction between rewarding Gassama for his act of bravery and working to prevent migrants from entering France illegally by stopping the stream of arrivals at its source.
“An exceptional act does not make policy,” he told reporters later, vowing to maintain a policy that is “exigent, respectful of our principles” on asylum and “rigorous” regarding the migratory flux.
The special treatment for Gassama comes as authorities prepare to evacuate some 2,400 migrants from makeshift encampments in the French capital. The forced closure of the encampments is the subject of a heated debate between the Paris mayor, who wants to ensure the uprooted will be sheltered, and Interior Minister Gerard Collomb, who was present Monday at the Elysee.
Gassama told Macron he was arrested and beaten during his long rough stay in Libya, “but I wasn’t discouraged.”

But the migrants who crossed Mexico in a caravan may face a long legal path.
Caravan organizers said eight members of the group criticized by President Donald Trump that traveled from southern Mexico to the border city of Tijuana were allowed in to be interviewed by asylum officers, but U.S. Customs and Border Protection did not provide a number.
About 140 others were still waiting in Mexico to turn themselves in at San Diego’s San Ysidro border crossing, the nation’s busiest, said Alex Mensing, project organizer for Pueblo Sin Fronteras, which is leading the caravan.
“The spirits are high, there was good news for everybody,” Mensing said on the Mexican side of the crossing, moments after learning that some were allowed in.

Asylum-seekers are typically held up to three days at the border and turned over to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. If they pass initial screenings by asylum officers, they may be detained or released with ankle monitors while their cases wind through immigration court, which can take years.
Nearly 80 percent of asylum-seekers passed the initial screening from October through December, but few are likely to win asylum.
The denial rate for El Salvadorans seeking asylum was 79 percent from 2012 to 2017, according to asylum outcome information from Syracuse University’s Transactional Records Action Clearinghouse. Hondurans were close behind with a 78 percent denial rate, followed Guatemalans at 75 percent.
Trump administration officials have railed against what they call “legal loopholes” and “catch-and-release” policies that allow people seeking asylum to be freed while their cases are adjudicated. The president tweeted Monday that the caravan “shows how weak & ineffective U.S. immigration laws are.”
The migrant ‘caravan’ that is openly defying our border shows how weak & ineffective U.S. immigration laws are. Yet Democrats like Jon Tester continue to support the open borders agenda – Tester even voted to protect Sanctuary Cities. We need lawmakers who will put America First.

Attorney General Jeff Sessions has pledged to send more immigration judges to the border if needed and threatened criminal prosecution. On Monday, the Justice Department said it filed illegal entry charges against 11 people identified as caravan members.
U.S. Customs and Border Protection said it processed hundreds of asylum-seekers in the previous week, many of them Mexican, which contributed to a bottleneck that led inspectors to turn away caravan members since they arrived late Sunday afternoon.
Asylum-seekers did not appear to be thrown off the by the delay.
Elin Orrellana, a 23-year-old pregnant woman from El Salvador, said she is fleeing the violent MS-13 street gang, a favorite target of both Sessions and Trump because of their brutal killings in communities in the United States. She said her older sister had been killed by the gang in El Salvador, so she is attempting to join other family members in the Kansas City area.
“Fighting on is worth it,” she said.
Customs and Border Protection has room for about 300 people at the San Diego border crossing.
“As in the past when we’ve had to limit the number of people we can bring in for processing at a given time, we expect that this will be a temporary situation,” the agency said.
During a surge of Haitian arrivals at the San Diego crossing in 2016, Customs and Border Protection required people to wait more than five weeks in Mexico. Since then, smaller upticks of Mexican asylum-seekers have caused delays of several hours.

The migrants, many traveling with children, left a downtown Tijuana shelter where they had been staying. Police with flashing lights escorted the buses to a cross-border rally at a Pacific Ocean beach, with supporters gathering on both sides of security fencing.
Asked how he felt as he boarded the bus, Nefi Hernandez of Honduras replied, “Nervous.” He said he intended to seek asylum with his wife and infant daughter, who was born on the journey through Mexico.
President Donald Trump and members of his Cabinet have been tracking the caravan of migrants, calling it a threat to the U.S. since it started March 25 in the Mexican city of Tapachula, near the Guatemala border.

Attorney General Jeff Sessions called the caravan “a deliberate attempt to undermine our laws and overwhelm our system,” pledging to send more immigration judges to the border to resolve cases if needed.
Trump administration officials have railed against what they call “catch-and-release” policies that allow people requesting asylum to be released from custody into the U.S. while their claims make their way through the courts in a process that can last a year.
The arrival at San Diego’s San Ysidro border crossing, the nation’s busiest, marked the end of a monthlong journey by foot, freight train and bus for the migrants, many of whom said they feared for their safety in their homes.
Hernandez, 24, said a gang in his hometown of San Pedro Sula, Honduras, threatened to kill him and his family if he did not sell drugs.
Jose Cazares, 31, said he faced death threats in the Honduran city of Yoro because a gang member suspected of killing the mother of his children learned one of his Cazares’ sons reported the crime to police.
But the travelers faced an uncertain future as they prepared to turn themselves in and face asylum. U.S. immigration lawyers conducted free legal workshops for the group, warning them they face possible separation from their children and detention for many months.

Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen said that asylum claims will be resolved “efficiently and expeditiously” but that the asylum-seekers should seek it in the first safe country they reach, including Mexico.
She warned that any asylum seekers making false claims to U.S. authorities could be prosecuted, as could anyone who assists or coaches immigrants on making false claims.
Administration officials and their allies claim that asylum fraud is growing and that many who seek it are coached on how to do so.
Asylum-seekers are typically held up to three days at the border and then turned over to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. If they pass an asylum officer’s initial screening, they may be detained or released into the U.S. with ankle monitors.
The San Ysidro crossing may be unable to take asylum-seekers if it faces too many at once, forcing people to wait in Mexico until it has more room, according to Pete Flores, U.S. Customs and Border Protection’s San Diego field office director. Flores said earlier this month that the port can hold about 300 people temporarily.

The Health and Human Services Department has a limited budget to track the welfare of vulnerable unaccompanied minors, and realized that 1,475 children could not be found after making follow-up calls to check on their safety, an agency official said.
Federal officials came under fire two years ago after rolling back child protection policies meant for minors fleeing violence in Central America. In a follow-up hearing on Thursday, senators said that the agencies had failed to take full responsibility for their care and had delayed crucial reforms needed to keep them from falling into the hands of human traffickers.
“You are the worst foster parents in the world. You don’t even know where they are,” said Democratic Sen. Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota. “We are failing. I don’t think there is any doubt about it. And when we fail kids that makes me angry.”
Since the dramatic surge of border crossings in 2013, the federal government has placed more than 180,000 unaccompanied minors with parents or other adult sponsors who are expected to care for the children and help them attend school while they seek legal status in immigration court.
An AP investigation found in 2016 that more than two dozen unaccompanied children had been sent to homes where they were sexually assaulted, starved or forced to work for little or no pay. At the time, many adult sponsors didn’t undergo thorough background checks, government officials rarely visited homes and in some cases had no idea that sponsors had taken in several unrelated children, a possible sign of human trafficking.
Since then, the Health and Human Services Department has boosted outreach to at-risk children deemed to need extra protection, and last year offered post-placement services to about one-third of unaccompanied minors, according to the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations.
But advocates say it is hard to know how many minors may be in dangerous conditions, in part because some disappear before social workers can follow up with them and never show up in court.

From October to December 2017, HHS called 7,635 children the agency had placed with sponsors, and found 6,075 of the cPhildren were still living with their sponsors, 28 had run away, five had been deported and 52 were living with someone else. The rest were missing, said Steven Wagner, acting assistant secretary at HHS.
Republican Sen. Rob Portman gave HHS and the Department of Homeland Security until Monday to deliver a time frame for improving monitoring.
“These kids, regardless of their immigration status, deserve to be treated properly, not abused or trafficked,” said Portman, who chairs the subcommittee. “This is all about accountability.”
Portman began investigating after a case in his home state of Ohio, where eight Guatemalan teens were placed with human traffickers and forced to work on egg farms under threats of death. Six people have been convicted and sentenced to federal prison for their participation in the trafficking scheme that began in 2013.
The hearing comes as the Trump administration has called for amending a law to allow the government to send more migrant children back to their home countries more quickly if they are not at risk of trafficking. The administration also is pushing to terminate the settlement of a class-action lawsuit that ensures unaccompanied minors are housed in the “least restrictive” setting, preferably with their parents or other adult relatives, while they await hearings in immigration court.

Last year, the administration announced it would begin arresting sponsors who had hired smugglers to bring their children into the U.S., a move that sent a shudder through immigrant communities nationwide.
HHS is re-examining its interpretation of existing laws to explore whether the agency is legally responsible for children after they have been released from its placement program, said Steven Wagner, an acting assistant secretary at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.
Homeland Security has coordinated the care, custody and removal of unaccompanied minors with its counterparts at HHS, according to an agency official’s testimony.
“DHS has worked closely with the Trump administration and members of Congress to address existing ‘loopholes’ that allow individuals to exploit our immigration laws,” said James McCament, a DHS deputy undersecretary.
Once migrant children turn 18, they are no longer eligible to be held in facilities run by HHS, and the agency is required to let DHS know whether the children should be detained or released into the community. But HHS only forwards those plans for one of every three children, the subcommittee found.
The number of children seeking refuge in the U.S. has not returned to the height of the surge starting in 2013, but spiraling gang and drug violence in Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador continue to push children, teens and families to migrate northward.
The panel’s top Democrat, Sen. Tom Carper of Delaware, said the agencies need to do more to prevent abuse.
“Given all that we learned in 2015 and 2016, it’s unacceptable that we can still be this bad at keeping track of these children,” Carper said."
https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/mexico-gives-caravan-migrants-transit-visas-as-group-begins-to-disperse,migrant,953,2018-04-04T15:21:31-04:00,"Christopher Sherman, Associated Press",Mexico gives caravan migrants transit visas as group begins to disperse,"MATIAS ROMERO, Mexico — The Mexican government began handing out transit or humanitarian visas to people in a caravan of Central American migrants, and said the procession of 1,000 or so migrants that drew criticism from President Donald Trump had begun to disperse.
Some migrants who awoke at the camp Wednesday said they would try their luck at requesting asylum in the United States, others in Mexico.
Elmer Zelaya Gomez, 38, from eastern El Salvador, has been sleeping with his wife and three children aged 7, 13 and 14 on the soccer field under blankets as they wait for temporary transit visas from Mexico to continue to the US border. He hopes to request asylum and join relatives in New York.
“We didn’t leave our countries just because we wanted to,” Zelaya Gomez said. “It’s for the safety of our children.”
Like many, he had joined the caravan — which was never expected to be so big, and never planned to go all the way to the border — because there was safety in numbers.
Now, the family faces the prospect of travelling solo; the caravan is scheduled to make its last stops this week at a migrants rights symposium in the central city of Puebla, and end in Mexico City.
“It seems a little complicated, with the robberies, kidnappings, and all of that,” Zelaya Gomez said. “It’s a little scary, to travel without the caravan.”
Organizer Irineo Mujica said, “We will try to find a better way of doing our caravans” in coming years. “We didn’t anticipate, or want, a caravan of this size.”
The caravan is an annual, symbolic event held around Easter each year to raise awareness about the plight of migrants and has never left southern Mexico, though some participants then continue north on their own.

Trump’s strong criticism of the caravan and Mexico’s supposed permissiveness in allowing it to proceed, have confused and befuddled families here, who deny they are a threat. Many say they never intended on going all the way to the United States after the end of the “Stations of the Cross” caravan. Some are seeking asylum in Mexico itself.
Even coordinators of the caravan seemed to misunderstand the debate in the U.S. when Trump’s endorsed a “nuclear option” for pushing funding for his border wall through Congress. They told worried families Tuesday that the U.S. president had floated the idea of using a nuclear weapon against the caravan of mostly women and children who have fled violence in Central America.
The Mexican government said in a statement late Tuesday that its immigration policy “is not subject to pressure,” but noted the caravan “began to disperse by decision of the participants.”
It said 465 migrants had asked for transit visas and 230 had gotten them, and another 168 were likely to get some sort of visa to stay in Mexico.
Though the caravan is uncomfortable — the migrants cook meager, donated rations on fires and sleep under the stars — they said risks they have taken should be an indication of how unsustainable their circumstances are back home. Hondurans predominate in this year’s caravan, but it includes families from Guatemala and El Salvador as well.
Sitting on a thin foam pad and trying to corral her sons, 2-year-old Jonathan and 6-year-old Omar, Gabriela Hernandez wondered aloud at what Trump must think of them.
“I see it as something really sad, because I don’t understand how a child this age can make things difficult for him,” said Hernandez, a 27-year-old who is two months pregnant.
She would like to get into the U.S., where she has a cousin in Houston. Crime in Honduras was so bad that she decided to embark on the difficult a journey across several international borders with two young asthmatic sons, the younger of whom is now sick and on antibiotics.
Late Tuesday, the first migrants began receiving documents from Mexican immigration authorities. Some give them 20 days to transit the country on their way to the U.S. border with the stated goal of applying for asylum. Others got papers in a first step toward a humanitarian Mexican residency visa for especially vulnerable people or a start to the application process for asylum in Mexico.
“Honestly, I want to be Mexican … We’re not going to cross. We’re just going to stay here.”
Mayra Zepeda, 38, of Honduras, said that once she gets documents to cross Mexico, she and her husband will continue their journey toward the border city of Tijuana. She said they hope to find better paying jobs there and aren’t planning to try to cross into the U.S.
The couple left Honduras in December after incumbent President Juan Orlando Hernandez was declared the winner of a contested election. The factory where she made T-shirts for export closed due to the weeks of instability that followed the election, she said.
She and her family stopped in the Mexican town of Tapachula at the Guatemala border for three months and she worked in a restaurant. When the caravan came together there they saw it as a good opportunity to make a move with safety in numbers.
On Tuesday afternoon, she cooked a cauldron full of sliced squash and eggs over an open fire for the caravan’s security team, volunteers who keep an eye on things.
“Honestly, I want to be Mexican,” Zepeda said. “We’re not going to cross. We’re just going to stay here.”

“The big Caravan of People from Honduras, now coming across Mexico and heading to our “Weak Laws” Border, had better be stopped before it gets there,” Trump wrote. “Cash cow NAFTA is in play, as is foreign aid to Honduras and the countries that allow this to happen.”
The caravan that once numbered 1,150 or more people actually halted days ago in the town of Matias Romero in the southern state of Oaxaca.
On Tuesday, the group — mostly Hondurans — that had been walking along roadsides and train tracks prepared meager breakfasts with donated food.
They were getting advice from Mexican immigration officials on filing for temporary transit or humanitarian visas in Mexico.

A couple hundred men did break off from the march Sunday, hopping a freight train north, probably with hopes of trying to enter the U.S. But the rest seemed unlikely to move again until Wednesday or Thursday, and they probably would take buses to the last scheduled stop for the caravan, a migrant rights symposium in the central state of Puebla.
Irineo Mujica, director of Pueblo Sin Fronteras, the activist group behind the annual symbolic event designed to draw attention to the plight of migrants, said the caravan would continue only to Puebla southeast of Mexico City, “but not in a massive way.”
After the symposium, some migrants might go to Mexico’s capital, where it is easier to make an asylum claim. Mujica said about 300 to 400 say they have relatives living in Mexico and so may consider staying here at least temporarily.
There were reports Mexican officials were seeking to end the caravan, but it was for all intents and purposes over anyway. The participants were never equipped to march en masse to the U.S. border or anywhere near it.
The “Stations of the Cross” caravans have been held annually in southern Mexico for about 10 years. They began as short processions of migrants, some dressed in biblical garb and carrying crosses, as an Easter-season protest against the kidnappings, extortion, beatings and killings suffered by many Central American migrants as they cross Mexico.
The organized portions of the caravans usually have not gone much farther north than the Gulf coast state of Veracruz, although some participants have then gone off by bus or truck to the U.S. border, moving as individuals or in small groups.
This year’s event seems to have gotten more notice in the U.S., and Trump has sent some angry tweets that raised hackles in Mexico, which in recent years has detained and deported hundreds of thousands of Central American migrants before they could reach the U.S. border.
“Mexico is doing very little, if not NOTHING, at stopping people from flowing into Mexico through their Southern Border, and then into the U.S. They laugh at our dumb immigration laws. They must stop the big drug and people flows, or I will stop their cash cow, NAFTA. NEED WALL!” Trump wrote in one. “With all of the money they make from the U.S., hopefully they will stop people from coming through their country and into ours.”

Mexico’s interior secretary, Alfonso Navarrete Prida, rejected such pressure.
“We will act with complete sovereignty in enforcing our laws,” he said Monday. “Of course we will act … to enforce our immigration laws, with no pressure whatsoever from any country whatsoever.”
In a statement late Monday, Mexico’s government said about 400 participants in the caravan had already been sent back to their home countries. “Under no circumstances does the Mexican government promote irregular migration,” the Interior Ministry statement said.
But it added that Mexico considers the annual caravans to be “a public demonstration that seeks to call attention to the migration phenomenon and the importance of respecting the rights of Central Americans.” The U.S. government has been kept fully informed of the situation, it said.
The department also said that unlike in previous yearly caravans, “this time Mexican immigration authorities have offered refugee status” to participants who qualify. But it suggested it is not up to Mexico to keep people from going to the U.S. to apply for asylum.
“It is not this government’s responsibility to make immigration decisions for the United States or any other country, so it will be up to the appropriate authorities of the United States to decide whether to authorize the entry of the caravan participants to U.S. territory,” the statement said.
Navarrete Prida had said earlier that he talked with U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen on Monday about handling migration, “in accordance with each country’s laws.”
Nielsen later tweeted that their talk focused specifically on the annual migrant caravan. “Working with Mexican officials to address the yearly illegal alien caravan. Exploring all options,” she wrote.
Mexico routinely stops and deports Central Americans, sometimes in numbers that rival those of the United States. Deportations of foreigners dropped from 176,726 in 2015 to 76,433 in 2017, in part because fewer were believed to have come to Mexico, and more were requesting asylum in Mexico.
Mexico granted 3,223 asylum requests made in 2016, and 9,626 requests filed last year are either under review or have been accepted."

Here’s why,"The U.S. is stepping away from a U.N. agreement aimed at addressing the needs of migrants, saying it could “undermine the sovereign right of the United States to enforce our immigration laws and secure our borders,” according to the State Department.
The U.S. joined the global compact on migration in September 2016 under then-President Barack Obama. Under that declaration, countries aim to “protect the human rights of all refugees and migrants, regardless of status.”
About 65.6 million people have been displaced worldwide, the highest number of displaced people since World War II, because of conflict and other hardships. Of them, about 22.5 million are refugees, according to the U.N. refugee agency.
The nearly 200 participating countries — now minus the United States — are negotiating a comprehensive approach to helping migrants. The final framework is slated for adoption next year. The decision came out just before the U.S. was to participate in a global conference on migration in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, aimed at assessing the progress of negotiations.
The terms of the declaration are “inconsistent with U.S. immigration and refugee policies and the Trump administration’s immigration principles,” according to a statement from the U.S. mission to the U.N.
The Trump administration’s policies include a ban on visitors from Chad, Iran, Libya, North Korea, Somalia, Syria, Yemen, and some Venezuelan government officials and their families. Federal courts have temporarily blocked the ban. (Update: The Supreme Court is letting the ban go forward while it is being challenged in lower courts.)
In addition, the Trump administration set a cap on refugees allowed to enter the U.S. at 45,000 in the 2018 fiscal year (19,000 from Africa, 5,000 from East Asia, 2,000 from Europe and Central Asia, 1,500 from Latin America and the Caribbean, and 17,500 from the Middle East and South Asia). The previous cap, set under the Obama administration, was 110,000.
Stewart Patrick, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations who wrote “The Sovereignty Wars: Reconciling America with the World,” said the current administration appears to place more emphasis on preserving U.S. sovereignty and independence over being at the forefront of drafting the international guidelines.
The U.S. withdrawal from the Paris climate change accord is another example, Patrick said. President Trump cited “a reassertion of America’s sovereignty” when announcing the U.S. departure in June, making the U.S. the lone holdout now that Syria has indicated it would sign the deal.
Both are nonbinding agreements.
U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Nikki Haley said Saturday in a statement that “no country has done more than the United States, and our generosity will continue. But our decisions on immigration policies must always be made by Americans and Americans alone.”
“My own view is that this unfortunate,” Patrick said, because these were essentially “high-minded principles that were trying to suggest that in every country, migrants should be treated humanely.”"

In this post, she suggests a solution to what may be the greatest immigration crisis America faces: a tsunami of refugees fleeing the violence of failing states in Central America.
— Paul Solman, Economics Correspondent
Watch Making Sen$e’s broadcast story on Utica, New York, “the town that loves refugees,” above.
Twenty years ago, when NAFTA was ratified, North Americans could profitably speak about two kinds of migrants: economic migrants and displaced people. The first was a personification of commerce — migrants who chose to leave home and travel where there was a demand to which they could supply a solution. The second was the human face of violence — refugees forced to leave their homes to travel to a place where their lives are not threatened. These categories seemed clear in North America in large part because a few years before NAFTA was signed, both the U.S. and Mexico had established robust refugee programs for Central Americans fleeing violent revolutions in their countries.
But we’ve collapsed the distinction between economic migrants and displaced people in recent years. Many on the left contend that the inability to feed one’s family — the deep poverty that we once thought produced only economic migration — kills just the same as a barrel bomb. Many on the right see migrants, even those recognized as refugees, as economic opportunists, benefiting from strong labor markets, supposedly generous entitlement programs and lax border controls in rich Western democracies. But this collapsing of categories, on the right and left, has not served the world well. We see now the awful human costs of an international legal order that does not, will not, guide and modulate human migration.
In addition to opening a door to regulated, cyclical migration from Mexico, that is, the United States should seek to reestablish another old order — these categories of economic migration and forced migration. We should begin by recognizing this fact: During the past five years, Mexico-U.S. migration has actually operated in reverse. More Mexicans are returning south to Mexico than are coming north to the U.S.
The southward movement of Mexican nationals makes clear that the real migration problem we face in North America isn’t Mexican migrants seeking jobs in the United States. Rather, it’s Central Americans (and now Venezuelans) fleeing violence in their countries and seeking asylum in Mexico or the U.S. Twenty-two thousand of these Central Americans are expected to apply for refugee status in Mexico during 2017, up from just over a thousand in 2012.

Mexico is not prepared to handle this influx of asylum seekers. Migrant shelters in Mexico are already overflowing. In Puebla, the Red Cross and various Catholic churches are opening new shelters to house increasing numbers of Central Americans who have taken trains to and through this central Mexican state. In Mexico City, asylum seekers from Central America and from Africa are being placed in increasingly marginal housing. This spring, a Somali refugee told me, “Never in my life have I seen such a place as this, and I was in Dadaab” — a complex in Kenya that forms the world’s largest refugee camp — “for 25 years.”
We should expect many of these asylum seekers to show up at the U.S. border during the next decade, much as asylum seekers have flocked to Europe during this decade. It is in our self-interest to recognize that displaced people are unlike economic migrants in that they do not choose to migrate — they are forced out by violence from which their governments cannot protect them. If we want to keep these displaced people from seeking safety in North America, in the U.S. and Mexico, we must proactively help countries in South and Central America to develop better governments and economies.
President Obama gestured toward these problems after thousands of Central American children came alone to our southern border in 2014. But his policies were reactive: He allowed more Central Americans to be recognized as refugees in the U.S. and directed U.S. officials to make asylum determinations in Central America before asylum seekers made the dangerous trek through Mexico. Truly confronting North America’s Central American migration crisis requires new strategy.

The U.S. is properly wary of involvement in Central America: Our government provoked the violent revolutions that produced mass displacement in the region during the 1980s. But our circumstances are not entirely different now. The gangs now terrorizing El Salvador and Honduras formed in the U.S. and were exported to Central America by Salvadorans and Hondurans deported from the U.S. in the 1990s and 2000s. Our failures of the 20th century should help guide our policy in the 21st.
Instead of influencing national politics in Central America, our aid and advice should be intensely local: 24-hour courts and youth centers and community policing in high-violence neighborhoods. A 2013 survey found that in El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras, “crime victimization is lower and public perception of security is higher” in communities where USAID has done this kind of intensive development work. We should emphasize programs introducing young people — who, in Latin America, display a record lack of interest in political participation and leadership — to politics as a means for change.
Instead of secret regime-toppling, our open aim should be institution-building. An institution with which we might start is CAFTA, the Central American Free Trade Agreement. Patterned after NAFTA, it seeks to create partnerships between the United States and Central American countries that are poor in part because they are too small to function on their own in a global economy. Economists — and the World Bank and the World Trade Organization — seem to agree that free trade can be a powerful tool for poverty relief. And lifting people from poverty has been linked to reductions in cyclical violence. This is worth a try in Central America.
President Trump made clear in a February address to Congress that “the only long-term solution for … humanitarian disasters, in many cases, is to create the conditions where displaced persons can safely return home and begin the long, long process of rebuilding.” His administration might begin to make good on this idea in Central America, where conditions are not yet so bad as to precipitate the kind of displacement we now see, for example, in Syria.
This, after all, would be an America First policy — one that recognizes that the United States is not the only “American” nation and that the people and problems we ignore abroad will, now or in other decades, find us here."

Regan,Number of unaccompanied child migrants surged in recent years,"More than 300,000 children have been documented traveling unaccompanied around the world in recent years, leaving them highly vulnerable to exploitation, according to a report released last week by UNICEF.
In 2015 and 2016, 100,000 children were found along the U.S.-Mexico border and 200,000 others were found without an adult in other countries, a number that represents a five-fold increase from 66,000 in 2010 and 2011. Aid organizations say that hundreds of thousands of minors are also likely traveling alone but are not counted in the report.
“This is just the tip of the iceberg,” said UNICEF Deputy Executive Director Justin Forsyth. “This is only a small part of a bigger picture. The second part of this is what is happening to children who are increasingly falling into the hands of traffickers and smugglers.”
Forsyth described a bleak scenario for the children migrating alone to Europe or the U.S., leaving them at the mercy of traffickers and smugglers along the route. The unaccompanied minors are predominantly fleeing poverty and war in Africa and destitution and gang violence in Central America.
Children from Nigeria, Eritrea and Somalia represent many of the minors taking the journey from Africa, while in Central America, most come from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador, Forsyth said. More than 60 percent of children who traveled from these regions were found to be trafficking victims.
He said that rape, enslavement and forced labor are particularly widespread along routes in Africa, where many migrant children move through Libya on their way to Italy and Greece and attempt to cross a perilous Mediterranean Sea route that killed more than 4,500 people and 700 children in 2016. Others leave Afghanistan and cross through Iran and Turkey to Europe, Forsyth said.

In 2015 and 2016, children applied for asylum in about 80 countries, and in Italy, 92 percent of all children who arrived by sea in 2016 were unaccompanied. Forsyth said a staggering number of them have told stories of abuse and that all of the young women he’s met, and many of the young men, have survived sexual assault.
One survey by the International Organization for Migration found that roughly three-quarters of children between the ages of 14 and 17 who were polled after arriving in Italy suggested they may have been “trafficked or otherwise exploited.”
“A big group of these children are teenagers, but they go as young as 8, 9,” Forsyth said.

While the report says abuse is less common along migrant routes in Mexico and Central America, which have seen a heavy uptick in recent years, U.S. immigration policies sometimes require children to return to countries where they will face the same dangers they were attempting to flee. Those that are found by U.S. authorities are required to attend an immigration hearing to decide their status.
“One of our main concerns with the Central American challenge is children who are sent back where they are abused again,” Forsyth said. “Whether [children] have a representative or lawyer present will determine whether they get the right to stay or not. So many children are sent back after those hearings and we know they are sent back to particularly dangerous environments.”

According the Migration Policy Institute, the number of unaccompanied minors heading to the U.S. from Mexico increased 90 percent between 2013 and 2014.
“The parents go by themselves, they leave their children behind and once their parents have entered the U.S. and establish themselves and have a place to live and they have some kind of income, then they will send for their children or tell their children to come and meet them,” said Faye Hipsman, a policy analyst with the Institute’s U.S. immigration policy program.
She told the NewsHour Weekend that many children are released to a family member or guardian in the U.S. as they proceed through the immigration court process, which can take years to complete because of backlogs. Hipsman said the smugglers have also caught on to the demand for passage to the U.S., charging an estimated $5,000 to $10,000 for the trip.
“The smuggling industry has shown a real ability to kind of drum up business and create new business models,” she said. “That’s one of the reasons behind the surge, is that smugglers have made it an available and easy trip to take.”
The report also noted that many of the state actors charged with overseeing the children who have fled their countries often leave the young migrants and refugees in crowded shelters, makeshift camps or they “are left exposed to the dangers of life on the street.” A mistrust of authorities or fear of detention and deportation prevents children from seeking help, the report said.
“We have seen a varying degree about how different states take care of minors,” said Amy Richmond, a child protection advisor for Save the Children, a non-governmental group that works closely with UNICEF on the issue of unaccompanied minors.
Richmond said that members of her organization are stationed in countries where many of the unaccompanied children cross through and set up “reception centers” to inform both children and families “what are their rights, where can they access services, and ways to protect themselves along their journeys.
Forsythe said UNICEF intentionally released the report before the G-7 countries meet next month in order to highlight the issue and to push for a six-point plan they say could reverse the rise in unaccompanied children.
“How far they’ll get in the G-7 to agreeing to it, we don’t know,” he said. “There is a quite a lot of disagreement between G-7 countries on migration and refugees in general. But in a way our message is: even is you disagree more generally you can do something for the most vulnerable children.”"
https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/250-migrants-mediterranean-shipwrecks,migrant,488,2017-05-10T11:33:58-04:00,Synclaire Cruel,Nearly 250 migrants are feared dead after Mediterranean shipwrecks,"Nearly 250 migrants may have drowned in the Mediterranean Sea since Friday, according to a preliminary report from the United Nations.
If confirmed, the incidents would raise 2017’s death toll for migrant crossings to 1,309 — a number slightly below the 1,380 deaths recorded during the same period last year.
But far fewer migrations have occurred this year, according to data from the International Organization for Migration (IOM). Approximately 49,300 refugees have arrived in Europe between January and May 7, 2017, compared to 187,600 for the same time frame a year ago.
The IOM said favorable weather conditions likely led to thousands of attempted migrant crossings over the weekend. A rubber dinghy sank in the Mediterranean on Friday as it tried to cross a particularly dangerous route from North Africa to Italy. Authorities rescued about 50 people, but another 82 were presumed dead. The IOM also reported that many of those rescued showed signs of torture.
On Sunday, another boat sank off the coast of Libya, leaving 163 people feared dead. Rescue operations are still underway.
The vast majority of migrant deaths occur along the route from North Africa to Libya. The International Organization for Migration estimates 1,222 people have died making that voyage this year, compared to 966 over the same period in 2016. Last year, more migrants drowned attempting to reach Greece and Cyprus. Nigerians are the largest nationality of migrants arriving in Italy by sea, followed by Bangladesh, Guinea, Cote d’Ivoire and Gambia, according to the International Organization for Migration.
The EU made a deal with Turkey in 2016 blocking migrant entry into Greece, according to Leonard Doyle, a spokesman for the International Organization for Migration.
“Migrants are making a much riskier journey in notoriously dangerous waters,” Doyle said.
Doyle added that more Africans are crossing from Libya, and more Syrians want to cross, but the route has been blocked.
UN High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi has called for action in light of the recent deaths, saying an increasing number of people are boarding unstable rubber boats that are over capacity and lack satellite phones that could be used to call for help.
“This cannot continue,” Grandi said in a statement. “There is an urgent need to address the root causes which lead people to move, as well as to offer credible alternatives to these dangerous crossings for people in need of international protection, including accessible and safe ways to reach Europe such as family reunification, relocation and resettlement.”
Officials are transferring the survivors to detention centers where they can receive medical attention.
“Many migrants need support after having lost loved ones at sea,” IOM spokeswoman Christine Petré said in a statement. “Having not only risked their lives but perhaps spent all their money and belongings on the chance of reaching a better life and then being rescued only to be transferred to a detention centre must be a horrible and emotionally challenging experience.”"

Two Tucson Samaritan volunteers remember the last time they came across a backpack in the Sonoran Desert.
They found it in January, when many migrants succumb to hypothermia during the winter months. Inside the backpack were food packets, electrolyte water, a black piece of plastic to sleep on, two boxer shorts and a pair of jeans rolled up, among other items. The volunteers say the backpack was “crispy” from the cold. One of the volunteers, Ron Kovatch, says you could still smell the laundry detergent on the clothes.
“It’s as though this person’s mother packed this bag,” he says.
A lot of these personal effects are scattered throughout the Sonoran Desert, where thousands of undocumented immigrants have died making the journey up north from Mexico.
In the desert, border crossers get hit by cars, drown, fall off cliffs and freeze to death, Alvaro Enciso says.
He later tells me the story of one thirsty migrant, who climbed into a tall water tank but then couldn’t make his way back out. He drowned in the water that began to rise when the pump started. His body was found on Nov. 23, 2012. To remember the migrant, the Samaritans planted a cross near the tank.
Enciso says not enough people understand the desperation of migrants wanting to reunite with their family or put food on the table.
It “makes you do whatever you have to do,” he says.
When I join Enciso, Kovatch and other volunteers on their humanitarian mission to leave water behind for migrants, we came across some items in the desert that belonged to them. Here’s a look at what we found:

Black water bottle — Upon seeing the bottle, I thought it was a repurposed bleach bottle. It had a similar shape and size. Enciso tells me that these plastic bottles are made in Mexico, specifically with migrants in mind. The bottles are black because they don’t “shine at night,” he says.

Tuna can — We saw a few cans on our hike, but there appeared to be more tuna cans in particular. Why? Enciso says tuna, even when cold, at least maintains some flavor, while beans do not.

Black plastic — As mentioned above, black plastic can be used for sleeping or to guard against rain.
While the Samaritans were making a grave marker for a fallen migrant at the approximate location where his remains were found, a small piece of black plastic was found nearby.
Thinking it belonged to the unnamed individual, one volunteer secures the plastic at the base of the cross with a rock.

Later that week, I drive to Nogales, Arizona, a little more than an hour drive from Tucson. The border fence cuts through downtown Nogales, separating the Arizona portion from Mexico. Houses and businesses run along the fence, and people can be seen talking to friends and family through its rusted steel beams.
Along the fence, right outside the downtown area, I find a weathered Loteria card of “El Sol,” or the sun. The card is part of a Mexican card game I played with my grandparents as a child. I always associated El Sol with a particular saying: “La cobija de los pobres,” or “The roof of the poor,” in Spanish.

It’s a saying meant to offer some comfort, a reminder that there’s shelter for you, even in dire situations. The Sonoran Desert, however, provides little opportunity for shade.
With a port of entry nearby in Nogales, Border Patrol agents are a constant presence — in SUVs, on bikes and on foot. Amid all the boutique department stores, vintage signage and tchotchke vendors, there’s a big store dedicated to tactical gear, no doubt a stop for local law enforcement.
Beyond building up the border wall, President Donald Trump has also indicated he will boost border patrol forces.
“Somebody has to arrest the people who are going to continue to attempt to enter even if there is a border wall,” the new U.S. Border Patrol Chief, Ron Vitiello, told reporters at his swearing-in ceremony earlier this month.
It’s a prospect that didn’t sit well with immigrant rights advocates I spoke with.
WATCH: How increased security affects life for border residents
Groups like No More Deaths in southern Arizona have condemned the Border Patrol, saying the agency’s strategy has used the desert against border crossers who risk more perilous terrain to avoid detection. On the hottest days, migrants face dehydration, hyperthermia, among other dangers, in a desert with little shade.
The agency has previously pushed back on those claims, saying smugglers, taking advantage of migrants, are responsible for their deaths in the desert.
“The smugglers are the ones that put immigrants in dangers. They’re the ones that force them to walk in the desert with limited water, limited food supplies and things like that,” Border Patrol spokesman Vicente Paco told the NewsHour.
“They’re whole purpose is to get monetary gain off of this. They don’t see a human life, they see a dollar sign,” he said.

Read Barajas’ dispatch:
After spending Tuesday morning laying out water for migrants in the Sonoran Desert in Arizona, Alvaro Enciso turns to me and says, “This beautiful desert has a secret.”
Every week, Enciso makes four crosses to represent a fallen migrant. Using data provided by the Pima County Medical Examiner’s office and the help of handheld GPS devices, Enciso and a handful of other volunteers head into the desert to then approximately mark the spot where each migrant’s remains were found.
The deaths are represented by the red dots on the group’s maps.
“It’s the end of the American dream,” Enciso says.
Enciso, 71, is part of the Tucson Samaritans, a faith-based group of volunteers who offer humanitarian aid — jugs of water, food and blankets in the winter — to migrants making the deadly journey north through the desert.
There has been a drop in Border Patrol apprehensions and in the wave of migrants who cross the Southwest border, but those who perish in the desert continues to climb. Enciso says the remains of around 3,000 migrants have been found by immigration enforcers or ranchers since 1999. This doesn’t account for those still missing, he says.
“It’s like a commercial airliner going down every year, and no one knows about it,” Ron Kovatch, 63, another longtime volunteer, says.

For these weekly hikes, Enciso also handcrafts crosses that are planted out in the desert. They’re decorated with what Enciso calls “migrant-handled” items, including tuna fish cans, discarded license plates, colorful paper left behind.
He started making crosses four years ago. He’s made around 400 crosses since then. Enciso says the crosses take the abstractions of the red dots on the map and “bring it out here.”
The first cross of the day is bright purple. A red dot is affixed at the top, and at the center is a scuffed-up lid. Green slips of paper, which was found at a soup kitchen for recently deported migrants in Nogales, Sonora, Mexico, complete the decoration.
After Kovatch consults GPS to pinpoint an approximate location of the first red dot, he digs a hole in the ground with a shovel that Enciso was using as a walking stick. Meanwhile, Enciso rattles off the information known about the dead migrant for the other four volunteers to hear. Normally, he reads out the person’s name, age, year remains were found and cause of death.
But there’s no name available.
Skeletal remains were found in this spot on Nov. 14, 2016, Enciso says. Nearby, a small piece of black plastic is found, possibly used for sleeping, Kovatch says.
When Kovatch is done shoveling, the hole is several inches deep.

The cross is lowered into the shallow hole. Quick-setting cement carried in a white bucket is then emptied into the gaps around the cross’ end. Water is then poured onto the mix. They have five minutes to orient the cross correctly before the cement hardens. Rocks are placed at the base to make sure cows don’t easily disturb the cross.
Brother Andres Rivera, another volunteer, then drapes a yellow and white rosary over the cross.

Enciso says these unnamed deaths are the “saddest cases of them all because the family has no closure.”
Two gallons of water are then usually situated under or in desert trees nearby. With a black marker, Rivera writes a message on one of the jugs for each stop. At the second stop, he writes: “¡Es Para Ti! ¡Que Dios Te Bendiga!” or “It’s for you! God bless you!” in Spanish.

Now, its focus is showing them the door.
Parliament is set to pass a law stripping pocket money, food and shelter from those denied asylum, potentially leaving them on the street. The interior minister proudly touts figures showing Austria as the European Union’s per-capita leader in expelling those rejected.
Austrian courts are toughening up too. On Thursday, eight Iraqi men were sent to prison for up to 13 years for the gang rape of a German woman on New Year’s Eve more than a year ago.
Lawyer Andreas Reichenbach, who defended one of the men, said the stiff sentences were a signal to migrants that “when they come to Austria, that such behavior won’t be tolerated.”
In Germany, where during the height of the influx Chancellor Angela Merkel insisted “we will manage,” the government now considers some areas of Afghanistan “safe,” and has started returning failed asylum-seekers to those regions. Additional tough measures have followed Berlin’s deadly Christmas market attack by rejected Tunisian asylum-seeker Anis Amri and gains by the nationalist Alternative for Germany party.
The pro-migrant attitudes that once led thousands of Austrian volunteers to turn out with food, shelter and advice to the first asylum-seekers are still heard some places, but they appear outnumbered.
“We have to keep welcoming those who have nowhere else to go,” said Marlis Bosch. “We in Austria have more than enough to share.”
A survey of 10 EU member countries last month showed 65 percent of the 1,000 Austrian respondents favored stopping all immigration from Muslim nations. Only Poles scored higher — at 71 percent — on Britain’s Royal Institute of International Affairs survey. But anti-migrant sentiment in Poland has been fueled by the government. Not so in Austria.
Former Chancellor Werner Faymann urged Austrians to deal generously with migrants as late as fall 2015, even as his government worked to secure its borders. But he was forced out last year after migrant policies threatened to tear apart his government coalition after he took a harder line.
His successor, Christian Kern, has found little choice but to stay tough — or risk boosting the right-wing Freedom Party and its message that migrants are overwhelmingly behind the kind of crimes the eight Iraqis were convicted of Thursday.
Freedom Party candidate Norbert Hofer, who advocates a tough line on migrants, was narrowly defeated in December in Austria’s presidential election. Polls continue to show his populist party with the most voter support.
But Kern’s Social Democrats have almost caught up since he took office less than nine months ago and continued hardening the country’s migrant policies.
Also gaining support on a tougher migrant stance is the centrist People’s Party, the Social Democrats’ coalition partner. Party member Sebastian Kurz, Austria’s foreign minister, is advocating setting up North African holding camps for would-be emigres from there.
The Austrian government plans to stop all support for those whose asylum requests have been rejected — including meals, shelter and a monthly allowance of 40 euros (about $40). If Interior Minister Wolfgang Sobotka has his way, those refusing to leave will also pay high fines and end up in compounds until they are forcibly deported.
The coalition’s majority in parliament means that approval of the draft law is virtually certain.
Still, some members of Kern’s Social Democratic party have joined with human rights advocates who say its passage could lead to increased misery for thousands and a possible rise in crime.
“Families with children, or the sick, all could end up on the street from one day or the other,” warns Christoph Pinter of the U.N. refugee organization UNHCR.
Sobotka shrugs, reflecting Austria’s sharp about-turn on migrants.
“Who is contravening the law — me or those who do not leave the country?” he asked reporters. “My responsibility is enforcing the law.”

Rescue workers from the Spanish-based organization Proactiva Open Arms pulled alongside the rubber raft, overcrowded with 112 migrants, handed them bright orange life vests, and ferried them to a rescue craft, which took them the rest of the way to the Italian island of Sicily.
The migrants were cold and hungry but relieved to see the rescuers. Proactiva’s coordinator, Gerard Canals Bartolome, said recently by phone that migrants taking the risky route from Libya to Italy would never make it on their own.
Illegal smugglers load the migrants onto rickety boats without life vests, food or water, and with only enough gas to get them to the center of the Mediterranean Sea, but not enough for them to make it to any European shore, he said. “We must be there to rescue them, otherwise they will die at sea.”
Proactiva Open Arms formed in 2015 when the migrant crisis was getting worse. It has 10 paid staff members and more than a dozen volunteers participating. The organization coordinates with the Italian Coast Guard on its rescue missions, because the area the mostly volunteer group serves is outside of the Italian Coast Guard’s domain.
In 2016, about 181,100 migrants reached Italy by sea, mostly from the African nations of Nigeria, Ivory Coast and Guinea, according to Frontex, the European Border and Coast Guard Agency. Another 175,000 migrants reached the Greek islands, including Lesbos, that same year, Frontex said.
The number of children unaccompanied by parents who arrive at Italy’s shores is growing, UNICEF warned this month. The U.N. agency has found that some of the girls are forced into prostitution to “pay” for their passage from Libya, and that boys are required to perform manual labor.
European agencies are trying to eliminate the smuggling business, but once they succeed in one location, the illegal trade crops up in another. Sadly, “people will leave their country, and they will find a way,” Bartolome said.

About 360,000 people successfully crossed the sea — mostly from Libya to Italy — in 2016, way down from the number who attempted in 2015, according to the Associated Press. But with 100 people believed dead in just one day and similar wrecks occurring regularly, the death toll this year surpassed 2015’s total of 3,800 fatalities in October and quickly reached a new record.
“That means that on average, 14 people have died every single day this year in the Mediterranean trying to find safety or a better life or safety in Europe,” said William Spindler, spokesman for the U.N. refugee agency.
Joel Millman, spokesman for the International Organization for Migration, said survivors’ stories told of at least 57 feared dead from a rubber dinghy holding around 130 people, and another 40 possibly dead in a dinghy carrying 120 people, the AP reported. Eight bodies were recovered.
The Italian coast guard conducted four rescue missions Thursday, Reuters reported. Survivors were brought to Trapani in Sicily.
The UN has said low-quality vessels combined with bad weather and overcrowding are responsible for the rise in death tolls.
“These (reasons also) include sending large numbers of embarkations simultaneously, which makes the work of rescuers more difficult,” said Spindler.
Most migrants come to Italy and Greece from Nigeria, Libya and other African countries, and rescue services continue to be strained.
“Addressing this situation while ensuring functioning asylum systems remains a policy challenge for many countries, but measures to save lives are available and UNHCR urges all countries to do more in this regard,” Spindler told journalists in October."

Final numbers have not been confirmed as representatives from the U.N. International Organization on Migration work to gain more details from survivors.
So far this year, the latest tragedy brings the total to 4,220 migrants who have died or gone missing while attempting to cross the Mediterranean to. Last year, 3,771 people died trying to make the journey.
Survivors from the latest wrecks told the UN that two rubber dinghies traveling from Libya capsized off the island of Lampedusa in southern Italy, according to the Associated Press.
Flavio Di Giacomo, an IOM spokesman, said on Twitter at least 18 women and six children were among the victims.
The Associated Press reports the IOM has recovered 12 bodies so far, but it is unlikely all the bodies will be found.
The journey from Libya to Italy is particularly dangerous for migrants, and smugglers often overcrowd small rubber boats that easily capsize on the open waters.
The U.N. refugee agency said last month that those factors, combined with bad weather, has led to an increase in migrant deaths in recent months, even as the total number of people crossing the Mediterranean declined."

Human Rights Council said on the first day of the mass evacuation.
The number of people processed Monday fell short of their goal of 3,000 in the week-long operation to dismantle the camp, the Associated Press reported.
Located 43 miles from Calais in northern France, the camp houses as many as 8,300 migrants, including at least 1,200 unaccompanied minors. The migrants, many who hoped to cross the English Channel into the UK, hail from Afghanistan, Sudan, Syria, among other countries.
“The informal camp for refugees and migrants in Calais known as ‘the Jungle’ is not an environment fit for human habitation,” William Spindler of UNHRC said of the camp’s closure.
More than 1,200 police have been dispatched to monitor the evacuation, which relocated the migrants to centers across France where they can apply for asylum.
Migrants started forming the camp as early as 18 months ago. The basic needs of the camp, which didn’t receive help from the state, were met by aid groups and volunteers.
French President Francois Hollande, who is up for re-election next year, is hoping to seal the France-U.K. border and rebut his conservative rivals’ claim that he has mishandled the country’s response to Europe’s migrant crisis.
Hollande has promised police forces will remain at the camp until it is dismantled.

Here’s why","The number of migrants who have died trying to cross the Mediterranean this year will surpass the number of deaths in 2015, the United Nations refugee agency said Tuesday.
The agency reports at least 3,740 are dead or missing so far in 2016 compared to 3,771 in all of 2015.
That despite the fact that about half as many people have made the journey across the Mediterranean this year compared to last. Even as the total number of migrants has declined, the death rate has doubled, UN High Commissioner Spokesman William Spindler told journalists in Geneva.
The UN attributes the rise in fatalities to multiple factors.
Some of the deaths can be linked to bad weather that overturns migrant vessels. Smugglers are using lower quality boats, including inflatable rafts. They are also overcrowding small boats with thousands of people, which makes the boast more susceptible to overturning.
And more people are traveling on the perilous route from Libya to Italy. Nearly nine in 10 migrants who died this year were on that route, The New York Times reports.
Migrant advocacy organizations warned earlier this year that more people might make the journey from Libya once routes were blocked from Turkey into Greece.
In a statement, a UN spokesman acknowledged the challenge countries that have been inundated with refugees face.
“But measures to save lives are available and UNHCR urges all countries to do more in this regard,” Spindler said. “Significantly expanding the availability of regular pathways for refugees to reach safety needs much greater and urgent attention.”
The Associated Press reports that Italy’s coast guard saved 2,200 lives Monday through 21 migrant rescue missions, although 16 bodies were recovered as well. The Italian Navy and Coast Guard is seeking assistance from the European Union to offset the burden of rescue and return missions.
The UN estimates that 65 million people worldwide are refugees or migrants, making it the worst refugee crisis since World War II.
In September, the UN General Assembly held a summit to address the migrant crisis. Filippo Grandi, UN High Commissioner for Refugees, spoke with the PBS NewsHour shortly after the summit.
“I think there is a growing realization that these are global issues, global problems that affect the whole of humanity and only working together we can address the root causes, we can address what pushes people to move on,” Grandi said."

At least 40 buses have left, transporting more than 1,600 migrants away from the camp, the BBC reported. Officials said they expect 2,500 people to be transferred from the camp Monday. But the 60 buses expected to leave today are not enough for all the migrants at the camp.
Before boarding the buses, migrants must give authorities their name, age and nationality before they are taken to centers across France where they can apply for asylum.
The process has largely been peaceful, but aid workers have criticized the lack of organization from French officials. Some migrants are confused about how to leave the camp, and the relocation of children away from “the Jungle” remains unfinished.

Some 200 children have left the camp heading toward resettlement in the U.K., but more than 1,000 unaccompanied minors still remain, based on estimates from Reuters and the BBC.
Sunday night, the camp saw fires and some migrants threw stones at riot police in protest of the camp closure. More than 1,200 police officers, some in full riot gear are at the camp, facilitating the move.
Bulldozers will begin razing the camp this week, though demolition of “the Jungle” does not guarantee that camps will not pop up elsewhere, aid workers warn.

The French defense ministry confirmed the crash but declined to say what the intended purpose of the surveillance operation was. The plane was heading toward Misrata in Libya, with three French defense ministry officials and two French pilots aboard, when it crashed during takeoff, Reuters reported.
The twin-propeller airplane was meant to monitor migrant trafficking routes for the French government, according to information from the Maltese government, the Associated Press reported.

Aid groups pushed to delay the closure, but a French court denied that request earlier this week.
“The government needs to take its time; otherwise, half of the people in the ‘Jungle’ won’t find a place in the relocation process,” Frederic Amiel an official with Emmaus, the British-based homelessness charity, told the Associated Press. “They will disperse and return,” he added.
The camp, located in northern France, has become a hub for migrants hoping to cross the English channel into the U.K. and is home to as many as 10,000 migrants from Africa and the Middle East.
The camp has long been a source of controversy. In early September, truckers, farmers, dockworkers and merchants blocked the main access route to Britain in protest over “disruption” caused by the migrants.
The French port of Calais has been inundated with thousands of migrants seeking ways to reach the United Kingdom. Blocked from transportation across the English Channel, the migrants have established a squalid camp, while residents of Calais feel the crisis is hurting the town. Special correspondent Malcolm Brabant reports.
Fabienne Buccio, head of the local administration, said the French government had 4,400 accommodations around France for the migrants, the AP reported.
The UK has agreed to take in some of the unaccompanied children in the camp who have relatives in that country. France also announced 80 college-aged students are being enrolled in a public university in Lille where they will learn French.
Migrants will be able to apply for asylum when they are relocated, French officials said earlier this summer."

The nonprofit group, known by its French acronym MSF, found that nine out of 10 migrants seen by its doctors suffered from anxiety or depression, a number that has tripled in two years.
The report, which MSF shared exclusively with The Guardian, indicated the mental health problems were the result of trauma — rape, assault or kidnapping — the migrants faced on their journey to U.S.
Ramped-up border security measures have partly led to an increase of violence against migrants, MSF psychologists told The Guardian, adding that two-thirds of migrants they interviewed said they were the target of at least one violent attack. The thousands of unaccompanied children and families are already fleeing brutal violence at home.
The migrants, largely coming from El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras, must take riskier routes to get to the U.S. border as American forces, working with Mexico, increased its surveillance of known migrant routes.
In 2014, at the U.S.’s urging, Mexico launched its “Programa Frontera Sur” to stem the flow of migrant children traveling alone across its southern border.
The U.S. State Department has already spent $15 million in equipment and training in Mexico and is expected to spend a total of $75 million, according to a Congressional Research Service report released earlier this year.
For the thousands of unaccompanied, undocumented minors fleeing brutal violence in Central America and attempting to enter the U.S., making the case to stay isn’t easy. Because they aren’t guaranteed a lawyer, about half of these children are forced to navigate the complex immigration system alone. Now, a class action lawsuit is challenging that policy. NewsHour’s Ivette Feliciano reports.
When the crisis caught the Obama administration’s attention in 2014, many of the Central American migrants rode atop a freight train, known as “La Bestia,” that traveled north through Mexico.
Now, with these immigration clampdowns in place, migrants have to walk for hours in isolated areas, and have to protect themselves from robbery, kidnappers, rapists and human traffickers, The Guardian reported.

Since 2007, our Making Sen$e page has vowed to do the same, turning to leading academics and thinkers in the fields of business and economics to help explain what’s interesting and relevant about their work. That includes reports and interviews with economists affiliated with the National Bureau of Economic Research.
Each month, the NBER Digest summarizes several recent NBER working papers. These papers have not been peer-reviewed, but are circulated by their authors for comment and discussion. With the NBER’s blessing, Making Sen$e is pleased to feature these summaries regularly on our page.
The following summary was written by the NBER and doesn’t necessarily reflect the views of Making Sen$e.
Tragic images of the Dust Bowl’s desolate farmlands and destitute migrants were ingrained into the American consciousness by John Steinbeck’s classic novel, “The Grapes of Wrath,” and by the iconic photos of Dorothea Lange.
Huge swaths of the Southern Great Plains were devastated in this human and environmental disaster of the 1930s. But did events really unfold as the popular account suggests? More than 70 years later, Jason Long and Henry E. Siu find new evidence on how many people left the Dust Bowl region, who they were and where they went. Their findings challenge conventional wisdom.
In “Refugees From Dust and Shrinking Land: Tracking the Dust Bowl Migrants,” Long and Siu examine census data and other source materials. They find that the out-migration rate was much higher from the Dust Bowl region than from other parts of the Depression-stricken country, and farmers were the least likely to leave impacted areas. Moreover, total out-migration was only slightly higher than in the previous decade. The depopulation of Dust Bowl areas was predominantly the result of dramatically fewer people moving into the region. The researchers also find that California was the destination for only a minority of those who fled.

There is little disagreement that the Dust Bowl was the result of an almost perfect storm of environmental and economic events, starting in the early 1930s with a drought and compounded by the enormous economic hardships caused by the Great Depression. These circumstances led to severe soil erosion, crop failures, unemployment, failed farms and businesses, foreclosures and, ultimately, human migration.
Using longitudinal data from the U.S. Census and other sources, such as Ancestry.com, the researcher focus on individuals living in the 20 hardest-hit counties in four states: Colorado, Kansas, Oklahoma and Texas. They analyze data from 1920 through 1930, before the Dust Bowl, and 1930 through 1940, during the dramatic events.

They find a population decline of 19.2 percent, from 120,859 people to 97,606 people, in the Dust Bowl counties studied, compared to a 4.8 percent increase in population in other parts of the four states during the same period. However, they also discover that the 20 counties had undergone tremendous migration “churn” in the years immediately after World War I, experiencing an in-migration rate of 47.3 percent in the 1920s, as the area boomed. In-migration fell to only 15.5 percent in the 1930s. The researchers conclude that depopulation was largely the result of falling numbers of new residents moving to these counties and “was not due to an extraordinary exodus relative to historical norms.”
They also find that farmers — so closely associated with the Dust Bowl tragedy in literature and films — were actually the least likely to move from the area. Instead, they tended to remain and to retain their assets and properties while others fled.
Where did migrants go? The majority of those who left the 20 study counties stayed in the four states covered by the study, while about 37.1 percent left. Contrary to the enduring image of “Okies” fleeing en masse to California, the research finds that migrants from the Dust Bowl region were no more likely to move to California than migrants from other parts of the U.S. or those from the same region 10 years prior.
“In this sense, the westward push from the Dust Bowl to California was unexceptional,” the researchers report.

The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees estimates 2,510 migrants have died in the Mediterranean so far this year. That is 35 percent higher than the 1,855 deaths that occurred in same time period last year.
Many of the deaths in the past week are attributed to boats leaving a town near Tripoli, Libya, making their way to Italy, the UN report said.
A report from the International Organization for Migration, also released Tuesday, indicated that when missing persons are included, the number tops 1,000.
“The past eight days marks one of the deadliest periods yet in the migration crisis, which is now in its fourth year,” the IOM report said.
On the Africa-Italy route, IOM reported, smugglers use bigger wooden boats that can carry more passengers than the rubber boats used on the route from Turkey to Greece.
“Smugglers put over 700 migrants in the wooden boats, whereas the rubber ones generally carry only 100 to 120 people,” said Federico Soda, director of the IOM Coordination Office for the Mediterranean in Rome. “This also explains the increase in the number of migrants dead or missing: One accident can result in hundreds of fatalities.”
The European Union recently struck a deal with Turkey to stop migrants from traveling to Greece. Migrant advocates expressed concerned the deal would force people to instead travel the longer, more dangerous route from North Africa.
According to UNHCR’s numbers, there hasn’t been a shift yet. About 46,700 boats have traveled to Italy this year, which is approximately the same number as in 2015.

Regan,Hundreds dead as migrant crisis escalates in the Mediterranean Sea,"At least 700 migrants attempting to cross from Libya to Europe may have drowned last week after three boats capsized in the Mediterranean Sea, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and Doctors Without Borders said Sunday.
The drownings came as a multinational coalition of ships combed open waters in search of survivors, while humanitarian groups and the UNHCR say the exact death toll may never be confirmed.
Nearly 100 people are missing from one boat that capsized on Wednesday, while a witness who spoke to the Associated Press described a second fishing boat overfilling with water before it sank on Thursday, killing up to an estimated 670 people. A third boat on Friday killed at least 45 people after it went down.

Many of the migrants who reportedly died last week at sea were from Eritrea, while a Sudanese man who commanded one of the boats could face charges. At least three infants were among the dead.
“Some were more shaken than others because they had lost their loved ones,” Raffaele Martino, commander of an Italian navy ship that rescued 135 people, told Reuters on Sunday.
Giovanna Di Benedetto, a spokesperson for the humanitarian group Save the Children, told the Associated Press that this week marks an escalation in the years-long migratory crisis.
“It really looks like that in the last period the situation is really worsening in the last week, if the news is confirmed,” Di Benedetto said.

At least 14,000 people have been rescued in the last week as the number of people attempting to migrate to Europe from north Africa has swelled. According to the U.N., nearly 40,000 people have made the crossing this year, mainly to Italy and Greece.
Another 160,000 people, mostly Syrian refugees, have taken to the Mediterranean this year in an attempt to reach Europe as the country’s civil war continues. Some European nations have shut down their borders to staunch the flow of migrants fleeing war, oppression and poverty. In 2015, more than 1 million people migrated to Europe, mostly via the sea.
Tommaso Fabri, of Doctors Without Borders, said European nations need to do more to stem the rash of deaths among migrants and refugees.
“It’s time that Europe had the courage to offer safe alternatives that allow these people to come without putting their own lives or those of their children in danger,” Fabri said."

In separate operations, members of the Italian coast guard, German ships and the Irish navy rescued the migrants off the coast of Libya, adding to the 14,000 people who were pulled from the sea during the last week during a multinational rescue mission.
Warmer temperatures and calmer waters have raised the number of migrants willing to risk the journey from north Africa and the Middle East, officials said.
Italian authorities said since Friday, 16 rescue operations have saved thousands of people stranded at sea, often on overpacked rafts arranged by smugglers. The bodies of at least 45 people who drowned during the journey also were recovered, and the official death toll is expected to climb.

The United Nations Human Rights Council said nearly 200,000 migrants have attempted the crossing from north Africa and Asia to Italy and Greece so far in 2016. More than 1,500 people drowned or are missing. Approximately 40,000 people traveled through Libya before crossing over to Italy.
Fatou Bensouda, prosecutor for the International Criminal Court, told the U.N. Security Council this week that migrants and refugees in Libya “were particularly vulnerable to violence, sexual violence and ill treatment,” which caused more people to attempt the dangerous sea route to Europe.
“We, as the international community, must take a closer look at who profits from criminal activity in Libya, and take coordinated steps to prevent further violations,” Bensouda said. “This must be a priority for all who are affected by the criminal trafficking of human beings.”"

View some of the reports below and see the full series here.
In June 2015, the U.N. refugee agency reported that the number of displaced people and refugees globally had climbed beyond 50 million for the first time since World War II. The war in Syria was largely to blame and Europe found itself on the front lines of a surge in humanity — refugees and migrants attempting to seek safety, security and opportunity within its open borders.
Special correspondent Malcolm Brabant dispatched to the Greek island of Lesbos to report on the migrants’ stories. He reported on Afghan and Syrian refugees arriving on rubber rafts to escape conflict in their countries.
He captured harrowing images of Molyvos Harbour as coastguards and fishermen brought ashore victims and survivors from a boat carrying about 300 people that had capsized, primarily because of overcrowding.
Brabant reported on Hungary’s controversial “Iron Curtain” aimed at controlling the overwhelming numbers of migrants crossing its borders, and he highlighted the drastically different approaches between neighbors Denmark and Sweden.
NewsHour correspondent William Brangham, meanwhile, tracked the treatment and sometimes mistreatment of refugees as they pushed north and west.
Special correspondent Jane Arraf highlighted the plight of Yazidis hunted and haunted by the Islamic State militant group in Iraq and struggling Syrian refugees in Jordan.

Roughly 4,000 people died last year under similar circumstances, many of them children.
The drownings came as the European Union prepares for an emergency meeting this week to address the flow of migrants entering the region. Thousands of refugees are fleeing war and poverty across parts of the Middle East, Asia and Africa and many remain huddled in camps along Greece’s border with Macedonia.

More than 1 million migrants entered Europe last year, but several Balkan countries have bolstered their borders to impede the surge in refugees, with many passing through to the wealthier northern countries of the EU. Macedonia has slowed to a trickle those allowed to pass through the country.
Between 13,000 and 14,000 people are now located along the Greece-Macedonia border, while another 100,000 more are expected to enter Greece by the end of March, according to a statement made by an EU immigration official on Sunday.

Greek Prime Minister Alex Tsipras has called for Europe assist with the large number of migrants. More than 2,000 are estimated to enter the country each day, with about 35,000 refugees overall now staying in Greece.
“Europe is in the midst of a nervous crisis, primarily for reasons of political weakness,”Tsipras said. “It has to become completely clear that the immediate start of a process of relocation of refugees from our country to other states of the European Union is a matter of utmost urgency.”
EU and Turkish officials will hold a summit this week starting on Monday in an effort to find a solution to the crisis.
“This is the greatest refugee crisis we’ve faced since the second world war,” said David O’Sullivan, the EU ambassador to the United States, to the PBS NewsHour on Friday.

Regan,Europol: Thousands of migrant children unaccounted for in Europe,"More than 10,000 migrant children who entered Europe during the last two years are unaccounted for, raising concerns some may have been swept up by criminal networks, according to Europol, the European Union’s international law enforcement agency.
Europol told the British newspaper The Observer the figure was based on the number of children who had registered with authorities upon their arrival to Europe and later disappeared, with the largest number of young people said to be missing in Italy.
“It’s not unreasonable to say that we’re looking at 10,000-plus children,” said Brian Donald, Europol’s chief of staff, to Agence France-Presse. “Not all of them will be criminally exploited. Some might have been passed on to family members. We just don’t know where they are, what they’re doing or whom they are with.”

Donald also said Europol has seen evidence of criminal networks preying on migrants, often targeting minors who have entered the region without the accompaniment of adults.
“An entire infrastructure has developed over the past 18 months around exploiting the migrant flow,” Donald said.
At least 5,000 children have gone missing in Italy and 1,000 in Sweden, Donald said.

The Observer also cited a statistic by the humanitarian group Save the Children, which estimates that 26,000 children entered Europe in 2015 without an adult. Europol said the total number of children entering Europe last year was at least ten times that amount.
“Whether they are registered or not, we’re talking about 270,000 children,” Donald, of Europol, said. “Not all of those are unaccompanied, but we also have evidence that a large proportion might be.”
Save the Children in December criticized the EU for not doing enough to protect and foster children.
“Despite many European countries and people generously helping one million refugees, Europe is doing too little to protect and help vulnerable refugee children and stop families drowning on our shores,” said Kirsty McNeill, the organization’s UK director.

More than 1 million migrants made their way to Europe in 2015, many of whom were fleeing the civil war in Syria.
At least 821,000 people entered through Greece, and more than 150,000 through Italy, according to the Geneva-based International Organization on Migration.
The announcement comes on the same day that 37 migrants, including 10 children, drowned off the coast of Turkey, after a 56-foot boat traveling to Greece capsized in the Aegean Sea.
January has been the deadliest month for drownings between Turkey and Greece, Human Rights Watch told the AP."

Regan,"Update: 37 dead, including 10 children, as migrant boat overturns","At least 37 people, including 10 children, died on Saturday as they attempted crossing the Mediterranean Sea from Turkey into Greece, adding to already staggering totals of migrants and refugees who drowned or were killed in recent years, many of whom took the voyage using over-packed rafts to escape Syria’s civil war.
On Saturday, a 56-foot boat slammed into rocks and then capsized soon after leaving Turkey’s shores while trying to cross a five-mile stretch of sea to the Greek island of Lesbos, Turkish state media reported.
Turkish officials said 75 other people have been rescued from the capsized boat and many were being treated for hypothermia and related injuries, though the death toll may rise as rescuers continue searching the now partially submerged ship near the resort town of Ayvacik.

One Turkish official told the Associated Press that the boat had “hit rocks soon after it left the coast,” while Turkish media reported that at least 39 had died, including people from Afghanistan, Myanmar and Syria.
“There are either three or four more bodies inside the boat, which had two decks,” said Saim Eskioglu, deputy governor for the coastal Canakkale province, to the AP. “The divers are trying to reach them.”
The International Organization on Migration, based in Geneva, has documented at least 244 migrant deaths alone this month, following the deadliest year on record in 2015 for refugees crossing the Mediterranean, when more than an estimated 3,700 people perished.
“January has been the deadliest month so far for drownings between Turkey and Greece,” Peter Bouckaert, emergencies director at Human Rights Watch, told The Associated Press. “Almost every day, more drown on this dangerous journey.”

The International Organization for Migration (IOM) said an estimated 55,528 migrants and refugees crossed the Mediterranean through the first 28 days in 2016 in an attempt to reach Europe.
More than 1 million people entered Europe in 2015, mainly through Greece, where 816,000 people crossed the Mediterranean Sea fleeing war and poverty, according to the IOM."

The six-month inquiry found that the government, overwhelmed by the influx of tens of thousands of children crossing the border to flee violence in Central America, failed to conduct the most basic checks on the adults entrusted with caring for the children.
Many adult sponsors didn’t undergo thorough background checks. Government officials didn’t visit homes and in some cases, had no idea that adult sponsors had several unrelated children, a possible sign of human trafficking.
Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, chairman of the Senate Homeland and Governmental Affairs investigations subcommittee, said the HHS placement program for migrant children suffers from “serious, systemic defects.” The report echoed the findings of an Associated Press investigation.
At a hearing reviewing the program, officials from the department angered Democratic and Republican senators, who dismissed their answers as incomplete or complained that they failed to take full responsibility for the children who were abused or exploited.
At times the officials said they did not have the legal authority from Congress to follow up on the children.
“We are mindful of our responsibilities to these children and are continually looking for ways to strengthen our safeguards,” said Mark Greenberg, acting assistant secretary for HHS’s Administration for Children and Families.
Greenberg testified that one case was a “deeply dismaying event” but said he was not able to discuss details due to an ongoing criminal investigation. He said policies in place at the time were followed.
“It’s discouraging that they won’t even acknowledge the fact that they blew it,” Portman said after the hearing. “They let these kids go be trafficked in horrible conditions and they won’t even say that if they had put in some basic common sense procedures they could have helped avoid this.”
More than two dozen unaccompanied children were sent to homes where they were sexually assaulted, starved or forced to work for little or no pay.
The congressional investigation and hearing was in response to a case in Portman’s home state of Ohio, where six Guatemalan unaccompanied minors were placed with human traffickers and forced to work up to 12 hours a day on egg farms under threats of death.
Lawmakers argue that the government weakened its child protection policies in recent years as it dealt with the influx. Portman said federal officials don’t know how many migrant children they’ve sent to live with convicted criminals across the U.S. over the last three years.
The congressional hearing cited the AP report that found more than two dozen unaccompanied children were sent to homes across the country where they were sexually assaulted, starved or forced to work for little or no pay.
The congressional report said that as part of the subcommittee’s six-month investigation, it reviewed “more than 30 cases involving serious indications of trafficking and abuse.”
Since almost all of the children have not been publicly identified, it could not immediately be determined if the children studied by the AP were among those cited by Portman.
According to emails, agency memos and operations manuals obtained by AP, some under the Freedom of Information Act, the agency relaxed its procedures as the number of young migrants rose in response to spiraling gang- and drug-related crime in Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador.
HHS bars releasing children to anyone convicted of child abuse or neglect or violent felonies like homicide and rape. The department says it recently signed a contract to open new shelters, and is strengthening its protection procedures as the number of young migrants is once again rising.
Some of the new policies were adopted in July, after prosecutors charged sponsors and their associates with forcing the teens to de-beak chickens and clean chicken coops on farms around the town of Marion. The department placed the children in substandard trailers without setting eyes on the sponsors or the environment, and only performed such home visits in less than 5 percent of cases overall from 2013 to 2015, the report said.
At the hearing, lawmakers from both parties bristled at the officials’ answers, saying they weren’t adequate when the lives of children had been endangered.
The panel’s top Democrat, Claire McCaskill of Missouri, said she was “disgusted and angry” by the results of the investigation.
“The bottom line is when a child is admitted into our country, the United States of America should be an example for the world of how we care for those children,” McCaskill said.
Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., stopped his line of questioning and left the hearing after saying that the witnesses were “the definition of non-cooperative.” Sen. Heidi Heitkamp, D-N.D., criticized the overly legal tenor of many of the officials’ responses and asked if they understood why the senators were angry.
The panel’s report says the agency still can’t track whether an adult is attempting to sponsor multiple children at the same time. In addition, current policies allow sponsors to prevent children from being contacted by social workers who go to the home for a check-up visit.
The report also notes that HHS did not spend all of the money it had left in the program even though it says it was overwhelmed and lacked sufficient funding to provide services. In a letter to lawmakers in December, Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell said a contingency fund is necessary to ensure children are not left at the border.
Burke reported from San Francisco.

Data from the International Organization for Migration, an organization that works with 162 countries to coordinate immigration issues around the world, indicates most of the migrants are from Syria, Africa and South Asia.
The vast majority have arrived by sea. Only about 34,000 of the migrants arrived by land, the IOM reports.
The journey across the Mediterranean is extremely risky and has claimed thousands of lives. The IOM estimates about 3,700 migrants have died this year, an increase of more than 400 fatalities from 2014.
The IOM used the numbers as a call to action, encouraging countries to assist migrants seeking a better life in Europe. “It’s not enough to count the number of those arriving — or the nearly 4,000 this year reported missing or drowned,” IOM Director General William Lacy Swing said in a statement. “We must also act. Migration must be legal, safe and secure for all — both for the migrants themselves and the countries that will become their new homes.”
The already-controversial issue of immigration grew into a fierce debate following the Nov. 13 terrorist attacks in Paris. One of the attackers used a fake Syrian passport to enter Europe through Greece.

In September, EU leaders meeting in Brussels agreed to country-specific quotas that would be used to relocate about 160,000 newly-arrived refugees in Europe. But some countries on the front lines of the immigration crisis are still skeptical as they face continued pressure on their borders.
On Tuesday, the Associated Press reports Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov criticized the EU in his annual speech before the Macedonian Parliament.
“The migrant and refugee crisis reminds us that we are left alone,” Ivanov said, referring to EU policy that allows member states to individually decide how many refugees to accept.
The NewsHour’s special correspondent Malcolm Brabant reported that Macedonia has recently cracked down on which migrants are allowed to cross its borders, creating a bottleneck in Greece.
By far, Greece has seen the largest influx of migrants crossing into Europe. As of Dec. 21, 821,008 migrants have entered through Greece and 150,317 through Italy. Another 29,959 have come through Bulgaria, nearly 3,845 through Spain, 269 through Cyprus and 106 through Malta."
https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/your-guide-to-europes-migrant-crisis,migrant,1068,2015-12-11T16:56:45-05:00,Margaret Sessa-Hawkins,A region-by-region guide to the Middle East’s migrant crisis,"The world is currently facing the worst migration crisis since World War II: millions are displaced and thousands have died this year alone. A substantial number of those fleeing their home countries are from Syria, Afghanistan and Iraq, collectively making up more than half of all asylum-seekers around the world in 2015, according to the U.N. refugee agency.
Their plight has had a profound effect on global politics, which have gotten only more complex following the November terrorist attack in Paris that prompted Europe to grapple more intensely with security and its open borders. To help clarify how and why the situation has had such an extensive effect on different countries, here is a region-by-region look at where these migrants have traveled and how governments have responded.
Turkey currently hosts the largest number of Syrian refugees of any country in the world. Since the crisis began, Turkey has accepted more than 2 million refugees, more than double that of any other nation. Lebanon also has taken in a sizable number, with just over 1 million currently living in the country. This number represents a quarter of Lebanon’s total population, and means that Lebanon hosts the world’s highest percentage of refugees per inhabitant. Jordan and Iraq also have accepted a substantial number of Syrian refugees.
Life isn’t easy for refugees in these countries. In Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan, they do not have official permission to work. Most do informal or under-the-table work, and many operate from their savings until it runs out. In Lebanon, the U.N. estimates that nearly 90 percent of refugees are in debt. Additionally, almost half of the Syrian refugee children in Lebanon do not attend school, largely due to the prohibitive cost of education and their need to work to earn money for their families.
To the south, the richer Gulf nations of Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Bahrain have not signed on to refugee conventions, and therefore have not formally accepted any Syrian refugees.
While the number is smaller, many migrants coming from Middle Eastern conflict zones endeavor to apply for asylum in Europe instead of settling in closer countries. The main path for them is to travel from Turkey across to Greece, up through the Balkan states, typically from Macedonia into Serbia, then on to Hungary or Croatia, then Slovenia, and finally into Austria and Germany. So far in 2015, almost 800,000 people have chosen this route. According to the U.N., 93 percent of those traveling this route are from Syria, Afghanistan and Iraq.
The journey is perilous. This year alone, over 3,500 people have either died or went missing trying to cross seas to Europe. Even the land route is not completely safe. Incidents such as one where smugglers left 71 migrants to suffocate in a truck outside of Vienna illustrate just how dangerous it can be.
There also are numerous difficulties for countries hosting refugees. From September to November, nations along the route from Turkey to Austria received between 1,000 to 12,000 migrants per day, with the median number of persons crossing the various borders daily hovering around 5,000. Registering the large number of people is a huge logistical challenge for most countries, as is providing shelter and food.
In order to avoid a large influx of migrants arriving, many countries have begun attempting to control the flow through their borders. Hungary has built a razor wire fence along its border with Serbia and Croatia, effectively closing it and forcing most migrant traffic through Slovenia. Both Slovenia and Macedonia also are erecting fences, although they state that these are merely intended to direct migrants to legal crossings.
Since the Paris attacks, the Balkan nations (Macedonia, Croatia, Serbia and Slovenia) have declared that they will only allow Syrians, Afghans and Iraqis across their borders. This policy is leaving many people stranded, and has in some cases led to violent clashes with police.
Source: European Commission
Since 2013, the system Europe has had in place for dealing with those seeking asylum is the Dublin Regulation. Under that rule, people wishing for asylum are required to register at the first country in which they arrive. These measures are meant to prevent migrants from applying for refugee status in countries with the most liberal policies.
However, the regulations have begun to break down in the wake of the migrant crisis, especially as some countries have been taking in disproportionately large numbers of asylum seekers. Greece, which has teetered on the edge of financial ruin, cannot cope with registering the large numbers of migrants it receives. Out of almost 1 million applicants in Europe this year, Germany has received over 350,000.
In an attempt to develop a unified response to the situation, in May and again in September, the EU approved relocation plans. Under the plans, 160,000 migrants would be moved from Italy and Greece to other EU countries. Each country was given a quota of migrants to take in, based on their GDP, unemployment rate, population and how many asylum seekers they had already accepted.
The move was controversial. Unlike most EU issues involving national sovereignty, it was not approved by consensus, but instead by majority vote. Romania, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary voted against it, while Finland abstained. Additionally, the United Kingdom, Denmark and Ireland all had “opt-outs” for the agreement. Ireland, however, offered to accept 2,900 extra refugees, while Denmark agreed to take in an extra 1,000. Instead of participating in the quota plan, the UK has said it will take an extra 20,000 refugees over the next four years directly from camps in the Middle East.
Since the plan’s approval, just over half of the nations involved have made places available for refugees. Of those, only six (Luxembourg, Finland, Sweden, France, Germany) have taken in refugees.
Some other countries around the world have volunteered to resettle Syrian refugees. Canada welcomed its first group of an eventual 25,000 Syrian refugees on Friday. Australia agreed to take in a similar number, and will accept just under 18,000 Iraqi and Syrian refugees. The United States has pledged to take in 10,000 Syrian refugees over the next year, however, this plan has caused considerable controversy.
As they stand, the relocation plans still do not provide a permanent solution to the crisis, as people continue to pour out of Syria, Afghanistan and Iraq every day.

“The reality started to sink in that basically, this beautiful water that we were enjoying was a hell for so many.”
So Catrambone and his wife decided to take action. They bought a boat, hired a crew, and in 2014, launched the Migrant Offshore Aid Station. Now, his crew trawls the ocean, rescuing migrant boats, and they’re expanding to Asia.
This week on Shortwave, we speak with Cantrambone about his work, his life and what’s next for his unique organization.

In an interview with the Russian newspaper Izverstia, Petra Laszlo said she will sue Osama Abdul Mohsen, the Syrian refugee she tripped, while he was carrying his son.
“He changed his testimony because he initially blamed the police,” she’s quoted as saying. “My husband wants to prove my innocence. For him, it is now a matter of honor.”
Laszlo also plans to sue Facebook for refusing to take down groups that shamed her on the social media site.
Following the incident, Laszlo sent an apology to newspaper Magyar Nemzet, denying accusations of racism, adding that “something snapped in me.” Hundreds of migrants, including Syrians, had broken through police lines and fled the relocation camp in Roszke, Hungary to cross into Serbia.
“The camera was shooting, hundreds of migrants broke through the police cordon, one of them rushed to me and I was scared,” she wrote.

Laszlo’s employer, N1TV, fired her after German reporter Stephan Richter of TV channel RTL posted footage of the moment online. It sparked an international outcry.
“I do not deserve the political witch-hunts against me, nor the smears or the death threats,” she wrote in her apology.
Laszlo currently faces a criminal investigation for “violence against a member of the community,” which carries a sentence of up to five years in prison, The Guardian reported."

“It’s like a big river of people, and if you stop the flow, you will have floods somewhere. That’s what’s happening now,” said U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees spokesman Melita Sunjic.
Hungary sealed its border with Croatia at midnight on Friday, leaving 10,000 people either stranded or re-routed to an alternate path west through Croatia and Slovenia. Slovenia has said it would take 2,500 people per day, but about 5,000 arrived from Croatia on Monday, Reuters reported.
Croatia was limiting new arrivals and Serbia said it might start doing the same.

Meanwhile, temperatures are getting colder in the Balkans, and in the next few weeks, freezing rain and snow are expected. Clogged migration routes will mean people will need to stay longer in border camps with mostly unheated tents.
“For now, it is OK. But in 20 days or so, it is going to be very cold here,” Uros Jovanovic, the manager of a processing center near the Serbo-Croatian border, told The New York Times.
On Monday’s PBS NewsHour, special correspondent Malcom Brabant reports on the migrant situation.

Montaño, who was born in the U.S., witnessed her parents’ efforts to gain papers that would allow them to legally remain in the country from a young age.
“I felt frustrated because I didn’t know what to do,” she said. “I was the only one that spoke English so I had to delegate for my parents when it came to meetings with lawyers, or even when we were trying to buy a house, to kind of be the adult at such a young age for my parents because of the language barrier.”
In 2010, Montaño joined the second year of the Barrio Writers program, a writing workshop founded by author Sarah Rafael García. The workshop, which meets in groups of 20-30 students for one week, encourages free expression and allows students to write in the language of their choice. It gave her the space to express anger at the U.S. immigration system as well as explore “more about my identity and what it means to be first generation,” she said.
Now, Montaño works as the program director for Barrio Writers’ Orange County chapter in the summer, where she said workshops have discussed topics like gentrification or police brutality, often sharing personal experiences that relate to those issues.
The workshop builds confidence among young writers, she said. “By the end of the week, we grow into a community. They come out confident and writing about their identity. We see a lot of growing throughout the week,” she said.
Montaño’s poem “His Machucada Hands” is a testament to the ways that being undocumented has taken a physical toll on her father’s body. The title, she said, came from noticing his hands on the steering wheel every morning as he drove her to middle and high school.
“It’s really hard for people like my dad, because they work under the table and there’s not a lot of protections for those people. … I always noticed his hands. They’re so overworked,” she said. “They’re black because of paint from yesterday, or sometimes they’re swollen. It’s a symbol of what this country does to people who are undocumented.”
The poem, like most of her other pieces, uses both English and Spanish, a reflection of the way she communicates in daily life. The piece is a “challenge” to the expectation that literary writing must be in English, she said.
Hear Montaño read “His Machucada Hands” or read the poem below.
His Machucada Hands
6 a.m.
The grey streets that dingle in his eyes
As he drives in his white Toyota pick-up truck through the fog
The pondering cold weather in the morning like the anti-immigrant laws that drown this country
Yes, it’s possible to live in, a world without borders
So un cafecito and donuts that only seem to ease the desmadre
The sweeping men dressed in yellow, that reads “Caution”
But never really stopping to caution about their own health
Day and Night
The bones click and clack
Like the baby rattles in my little brothers hand
See to take away the pain at the end of the day
He must drink away his 40’s till he doesn’t feel 40 anymore
I don’t blame him for being an alcoholic at times
I blame the exploitation
I blame the emotional and physical borders
I blame the corruption and greed that haven’t done no deed
Too much back pain and machucada hands
He don’t believe in Western medicine but the natural remedies his mama gave him once before he crossed over
Standing for more than 2 hours on wait at Home Depot
After, hustle for more than 7 hours of underpaid work
Yes, he’s just trying to provide and survive
Not divide like the men in suits that play, ‘Poli-Migra’
What kind of living is that?
See our father
Is just trying to make enough
Yet still can’t even call it living
See his hands have been exploited enough that they aren’t recognizable to his eyes no more
They become rough
Deep with cuts like the nopales rooted out of la tierra
He has come to accepting that’s the way it must go
That’s messed up
No one deserves to be exploited
Not our father
Sometimes he just wish he can join the rallies and protests
He can’t put the fist up in the air
Cuz his hands has been in the fist for too long
Since the day he crossed la frontera
Why are we so consumed to being the chingones in the movement?
When its our parents whom we need to empower
So they must not fear and say no more to being exploited
But somehow we all seem to forget that he needs living too
The living to see his mother and homeland
The living to see his children graduate
The living to love his wife more
The living to just be
To really get that ‘American Dream’
What is the ‘American Dream’?
There are too many perspectives
Too many borders trying to divide this, ‘American Dream’
So why is our family just not the right fit?
Why must you cringe at the sight of seeing my father’s hand and skin?
Why must you put him down?
See my dad got more fuerza than the one you trained in the academy
As I sit writing away
Look at my hand
He has sacrificed so much so I don’t get his machucada hands
It is our family’s becoming
Written through the vein that circulates in his machucada hands
Passed so softly to the tips of my hands
The day he held me for the first time out of my mother’s womb

General Assembly speeches in 2015 focus on Iran deal, migrants","More than 150 world leaders are gathering at U.N. headquarters in New York this week with a migrant crisis, cyber warfare and raging Syrian conflict as the backdrop.
The Syrian conflict, now in its fourth year, is straining neighboring countries in the Middle East and has spread to Europe, where government officials are trying to come up with a coordinated response. The United States has upped its quota of refugees, but many in the international community think it isn’t enough.
The United Nations members also are working on updating their development goals and looking toward December’s U.N. climate conference in Paris, where participants will be drafting a new international protocol for the environment.
President Barack Obama said Monday the U.S. is willing to work with Russia and Iran on a “managed transition” to remove Syrian President Bashar al-Assad from power.
But Russian President Vladimir Putin said it was a “mistake” not to involve Assad’s military in the fight against the Islamic State group.
Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said, following approval of a comprehensive nuclear deal, that a “new chapter” has started in Iran’s relations with the world.
Cuban President Raul Castro spoke of the particularly harmful effects climate change has on developing island nations and African countries, and demanded fair treatment for them.
Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi described his country’s fight against extremism and the need to direct young people’s energies toward positive choices.
Chief Executive Officer of Afghanistan Abdullah Abdullah called on Pakistan to help crack down on terror networks. He said Afghanistan agreed to peace talks with the Taliban and later learned the Taliban leader had been dead for more than two years, making the talks a “sham.”
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko said Tuesday that unmarked Russian military servicemen are continuing to occupy parts of Ukraine, and sanctions against Russia should be stiffened.
Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos announced the end to his country’s conflict to applause from the attendees. He said the fighting factions are prepared to sign a peace agreement by March 23, 2016.
Donald Tusk, president of the European Council of the European Union, said the migrant crisis has global dimensions and that Europe was trying to be fair when discussing a system of quotas for taking in refugees. “Everyone can offer help to the refugees. And those who do not want to, at least shouldn’t hide their indifference by criticizing Europe for doing too little,” he said.
Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said Wednesday that Israeli extremist groups are preventing Palestinians from entering Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem. “I call on the Israeli government, before it is too late, to cease its use of brutal force to impose its plans to undermines the Islamic and Christian sanctities in Jerusalem,” he said.
Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi said as his country battles terrorist groups, it also needs help from other countries and institutions on repairing the damaged infrastructure.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told members of the U.N. General Assembly Thursday to “check your enthusiasm at the door” on the deal to curb Iran’s nuclear weapons program, saying it would only bring nations closer to war. He also said he remains committed to a two-state solution to the Palestinian conflict but that it was the Palestinians who refused to talk.
On the migrant crisis, Germany’s Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier said his country has taken in 600,000 refugees and 10,000 more are arriving every day. “We have to end the brutality of Assad’s dictatorship, as evinced by its use of barrel bombs and torture; break the control of Islamic State; and silence the guns in Syria, and provide for humanitarian access,” Steinmeier said.
Vice President of South Sudan James Wani Igga cited the signing of the peace accord in August that ended his country’s civil war and urged the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) regional body to quickly implement an enforcement mechanism.
Burundi’s Vice President Joseph Butore downplayed a recent military coup attempt in his country.
Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said Friday that “Syria will continue to fight terrorism” and it is the duty of the international community to help. He said the only way to a political solution is through a Syrian-led national dialogue without any foreign influence. He praised Russia for its help, criticized Israel and Turkey for causing destruction, and called upon the European Union and United States to lift sanctions.

“I don’t see it abating, I don’t see it stopping,” Amin Awad, regional refugee coordinator for the U.N. refugee agency UNHCR, said to journalists in Geneva. “If anything, it gives an indication perhaps that this is the tip of the iceberg.”
Additionally, escalating conflict in Iraq could send new waves of displaced people to Europe.

Dominik Bartsch, the UN’s deputy humanitarian coordinator in Iraq, said the UN is planning for the displacement of 500,000 people from the Iraqi city of Mosul, if Iraqi forces launch an attempt to recapture it from Islamic State, Reuters reported.
“The humanitarian situation is worsening dramatically,” Bartsch said, citing a recent cholera outbreak and estimating that 10 million people will need humanitarian aid by the end of the year, The New York Times reported.

EU leaders have pledged at least $1.1 billion for Syrian refugees in the Middle East and closer cooperation to stem migrant flows into Europe at a summit described as less tense than feared after weeks of feuding.
Most asylum seekers reaching Europe, many on dinghies crossing the Mediterranean or hidden in trucks, are from Syria or Iraq. Others are from Afghanistan, Pakistan and African countries including Sudan, Eritrea and Somalia, Reuters reported.

The European Union has called an emergency meeting on Monday to address the crisis. Take our five-minute quiz — a new feature on our World page — to learn more about the tidal wave of migrants entering Europe.
Syrians escaping an uprising against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad make up the largest refugee population. The fighting between government and rebel forces, which began in March 2011, has killed an estimated 250,000, forced about 4 million to leave the country, and left another 6 million homeless inside Syria.
A proposal for European Union nations to take in about 160,000 additional asylum-seekers (not just Syrians) and distribute them — through a quota system — among the 28 EU member nations gained traction this week.
The influx of newcomers is worrying to some, including people in Hungary who are concerned about its impact on their national identity. Meanwhile, President Barack Obama directed his administration to up its refugee intake this year.

“I appeal to the parishes, the religious communities, the monasteries and sanctuaries of all Europe to show the true meaning of the Gospel and take in one family of refugees,” he said to a crowd of thousands in St. Peter’s Square.
Each of the Vatican’s two parishes will provide shelter to a refugee family in the coming days, he announced.
The calling came the same day as the Pope penned a criticism of Hungary’s handling of the mass migration, Reuters reported.
“It is violence to build walls and barriers to stop those who look for a place of peace,” Pope Francis said in a letter to a church association. “It is violence to push back those who flee inhuman conditions in the hope of a better future.”

Hundreds more, who did not board the Hungarian buses and trains, began walking the 100 miles from Budapest toward Vienna.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel said that every asylum seeker entering Germany will get a fair hearing, and pledged there would be no cap on the number the country will accept.
“The right to political asylum has no limits on the number of asylum seekers,” Merkel told reporters. “As a strong, economically healthy country we have the strength to do what is necessary.”
British finance minister George Osborne said Saturday that a comprehensive plan was necessary to stem the migrant crisis, and that any long-term solution would need to deal with the root cause of the problem, Reuters reported.
“You’ve got to deal with the problem at source, which is this evil Assad regime and the ISIL (Islamic State) terrorists, and you need a comprehensive plan for a more stable, peaceful Syria,” Osborne told Reuters. “A huge challenge of course, but you can’t just let that crisis fester. We’ve got to get engaged in that.”

Two days ago, Hungary had blocked the migrants from travelling on trains to Austria, stranding thousands of them in Budapest. After hundreds of refugees began walking the 150 miles to Austria, Hungary agreed to buses. The buses will apparently pick up the migrants stranded at Budapest’s main train station, as well as those that had already begun walking.
The decision comes as Europe still tries to figure out what to do with the biggest migrant crisis since the end of World War II.
It also comes on the same day the Hungarian parliament passed emergency anti-immigration laws to halt the surge of refugees crossing into the EU, reports the AFP.
The new laws call for a three-year jail term for anyone caught climbing the newly built razor wire fence on the border with Serbia, and new transit zones, where asylum-seekers must stay while their application is being processed.
While some countries are tightening their laws, Ireland announced today it would take in an additional 1,800 refugees, after accepting 600.

The situation in Hungary is just the latest in a series of crises occurring as European nations struggle to cope with the largest mass migration since the end of World War II. The influx of migrants – many of whom are fleeing violence and instability in their home countries – has been disproportionately impacting the poorer countries of the EU such as Greece, Italy, and Hungary.
This year, Hungary has accepted more than 150,000 migrants in an often lax effort to register all of them. While migrants remained stranded, Hungary’s prime minister, Viktor Orban, plans to meet with European leaders in Brussels on Thursday to reconcile the current crisis.
The dangers that befall migrants in the desperate position to cross borders are well documented. But now, migrants are experiencing these risks within the EU. Just last week 50 smuggled migrants were found dead in a van on the outskirts of Vienna.
The influx of migrants, the burden they are placing on countries, as well as the risks they are facing have all forced many in the EU to question its asylum policy. Currently, under the Dublin System, refugees should apply for asylum in the first country the enter. However, Greece has said it has been inundated with applications, and Hungary has been building a controversial razor-wire fence around its borders to keep migrants out.
Recently, Germany agreed to suspend the Dublin System, and said it will begin registering migrants in Germany. Finland has also agreed to stop sending migrants back to the country they arrived in.
However, many countries in the EU are still struggling to determine how they will deal with the influx, which shows no sign of abating."

More than 300,000 migrants, many of whom are fleeing conflict in Africa and the Middle East, have entered southern Europe this year, with at least 100,000 arriving during July alone.
In response to the differing laws across Europe governing the steady influx of asylum seekers, French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius on Sunday criticized eastern European countries that have refused to take in migrants, singling out Hungary, which built a fence along its border with Serbia to keep migrants out.

“Hungary is not respecting Europe’s common values, so the European authorities need to have a serious, even a stern discussion with its officials concerning refugees,” Fabius said. “With regard to all those people who are politically chased out of their country and who are in war-torn countries, we have to be able to welcome them.”
Meanwhile, seven died on Sunday after a boat carrying migrants capsized off the coast of Libya, officials said.
“We had reports this morning that there are seven bodies of illegal migrants that sank off Khoms (east of Tripoli) … but we don’t have any details how many migrants were on board,” Mohamad al-Misrati, a spokesman for the Red Crescent in Tripoli, told Reuters.

Pope Francis led prayers on Sunday for the migrants who’ve died attempting to cross into Europe, including the 71 found dead in a truck on an Austrian motorway last week.
The victims found in the truck, which included a baby girl and three children, are thought to be refugees from Syria or Afghanistan, Reuters reported.
At St. Peter’s Square in Rome, Francis asked the crowd to pray silently with him for those who die “on their terrible journeys,” the Guardian reported.
He also urged cooperation to stop these crimes that “offend the entire human family.”"

A record 50,000 migrants have landed in Greece by boat from Turkey in July, Reuters reported, and arrivals have exceeded 160,000 this year, exposing massive shortages in the country already mired in the worst economic crisis in generations.
Elsewhere on Saturday, Italy’s Coast Guard says it coordinated the rescue of 4,400 migrants from overcrowded boats in the Mediterranean Sea on Saturday — the most in a single day — officials reported.
Italian, Norwegian and Irish naval forces carried out the rescues in 22 separate operations, the Associated Press reported, after smugglers took advantage of ideal sea conditions off the coast of Libya to pack migrants onto a fleet of unseaworthy boats and inflatable dinghies.
So far in 2015, about 110,000 migrants have been rescued off of Libya and brought to southern Italian ports.

The captain of the fishing boat told Italian state television that the migrants died of suffocation from diesel fumes when the ship’s hold began taking on water, Reuters reported.
More than 300 survivors were rescued from the boat, but Italian Navy commander Massimo Tozzi told reporters that his men found the migrants who died in the hold, “immersed in water, fuel and human excrement.”
More than 100,000 migrants seeking asylum have arrived in Italy alone this past year.

Maritime tragedies on the Mediterranean like this one have become alarmingly common throughout the past year.
In April, 800 migrants drowned when their vessel capsized off the coast of Libya. In early August, 200 more died under similar circumstances, according to the International Organization for Migration.
Just this week, 60 migrants drowned when extreme heat caused their rubber dinghy to deflate during the passage.
The IOM estimates that rescues on the Mediterranean have averaged 1,000 migrants per day this summer, and in a report released Friday the agency calculated that close to 250,000 migrants who crossed the Mediterranean have sought asylum in Europe in 2015.
Migrants often pay large sums of money to traffickers who promise to smuggle them into Europe, most often via Italy or Greece. Lack of political stability in Libya has made the North African country the default departure point for these journeys, which carry migrants largely from Eritrea, Nigeria, and Somalia.
Italian officials have called on the international community and the European Union in particular to act to help curb the crisis, but so far in 2015, the numbers of migrants choosing to make the dangerous journey has already surpassed totals for 2014."

According to Maureen Meyer, who works at the think tank’s department on Mexico and migrant rights, the situation on the ground in Central America has actually gotten worse.
“You can look at the situation in El Salvador where they are reporting homicide rates now the highest they’ve been since the country was in Civil War in 1992,” she told Shortwave. “You have very deep institutional crises both in Guatemala and in Honduras. I think a lot of people continue to leave the Northern Triangle countries for their life.”
And they’re ending up in Mexico, where officials have cracked down on apprehending migrants, which have led to some dangerous unintended consequences, Meyer said.

But then the poet in question is himself unique, his appointment today by the Library of Congress makes him the first Latino to hold the position.
We stood in the heat and dust of a field on a farm in California’s San Joaquin Valley. Juan Felipe Herrera pointed to grapes on a vine and talked of how his parents had worked in places like this, picking fruits and vegetables. Herrera was born here in Fowler, but he didn’t stay long. His mother rested from giving birth and then the family piled into the 1940s army truck his father had bought and set off again, up and down California, “crop to crop, field to field.”
Herrera is a lovely and modest man, who seems genuinely moved by the honor being bestowed upon him. He and his wife, Margarita, told me separately of how all this was unimaginable decades ago — their humble origins, their early attempts to find a voice through writing and theater. Herrera spoke of being part of the ferment and excitement of the 60s and 70s, the attempt by people like himself to “become visible” through the creation of a stronger Chicano culture. He told me of being punished in the first grade because he couldn’t speak english; he then went on to get degrees at UCLA and Stanford, and an MFA at the Iowa Writers’ Workshop.
Herrera will take up his duties in the fall, succeeding Charles Wright as Poet Laureate.
As we stood there, I asked if he saw a direct line from this place to his poetry and now, to his role as laureate. “It’s an interesting line,” he said. “Perhaps like the way these leaves spread out and the way they curl in many directions, and how they have many features, I think that’s how my road has been. It has reached out in many directions — to Mexico, to indigenous pueblos, to families and students, teaching and workshops and of course my father and mother’s hand on these leaves. And being born right here. It’s all my story.”

But as U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement expands the centers to make space for the next wave of arrivals, the agency faces legal and political challenges that could shut them down. And a new flow of migrants raises questions as to whether the strategy has deterred migration at all.
One center is a purpose-built, 50-acre campus in Dilley, an hour’s drive southwest of San Antonio. Another, smaller center is tucked among derricks in Karnes City. They will be able to house some 3,400 migrants once they reach full capacity, just a fraction of those crossing, leaving ICE with few options besides releasing many with notices to appear in court, as it did in the past.
Some 130 House Democrats and 33 senators have called on the government to halt family detention, while a federal judge in California has tentatively ruled that the policy violates parts of an 18-year-old court settlement that says immigrant children cannot be held in secure facilities. ICE responded by pledging to improve its centers while it awaits the judge’s ruling.
“We are moving in the direction of closing these centers down,” said Jonathan Ryan, executive director of the Refugee and Immigrant Center for Education and Legal Services.
In April, Judge Dolly Gee tentatively ruled that family detention violates parts of a 1997 settlement in a case known as Flores V. Meese. The settlement stipulates migrant children must be released only to foster care, relatives or – if they must be held – in the least restrictive environment possible in facilities licensed to care for children.
Gee placed her ruling on hold and kept it secret so that government and immigration lawyers can try to negotiate a solution by mid-June. But a memo describing the ruling by Carlos Holguin, an attorney with the Center for Human Rights and Constitutional Law in California, says Gee agreed that the settlement applied to all minors in immigration custody, including those accompanied by a parent, and found the new detention facilities not licensed to care for children.
ICE director Sarah Saldana responded to the court in a statement saying that the agency would review cases of families detained more than 90 days, increase oversight and explore ways to improve conditions. “We understand the unique and sensitive nature of detaining families,” she said.
In making its case for detention last year, the Department of Homeland Security argued that the centers were necessary to stamp out a widespread belief among migrants that the government was doling out “permisos” for them to stay, actually notices to appear in court.
According to the memo, Gee questioned whether the centers had served that purpose. Holguin wrote that the court found it “astonishing” that immigration authorities had adopted a policy demanding such expensive infrastructure without solid evidence that building it would discourage illegal migration. Nearly 17,000 families have already been caught at the border during the first seven months of this fiscal year, which began in October.
Family detention isn’t cheap. An ICE official said it costs $300 per day for each woman or child housed at Dilley. At a capacity of 2,400 people, it will cost the federal government $720,000 a day, or nearly $263 million a year. The smaller detention center in Karnes costs ICE $160 per detainee per day and is expected to have 1,000 beds by year’s end. The only other family detention center is in Berks County, Pennsylvania. For-profit prison operators manage all three facilities overseen by ICE.
Women with children caught entering the country illegally can be released or placed in detention. ICE says its decisions to detain or not depend on factors that include bed space and the ages and sexes of children.
The Texas centers provide considerable freedom of movement and boast amenities – Dilley has a huge indoor gym, soccer field and classrooms with touch-screen TVs and computers and the Karnes center has a library stocked with bilingual children’s books. But detainees would much rather have been released on the promise to show up in court, as happened to Jeysel Amaya.
Amaya, 24, said she left El Salvador because gang members “were threatening me and my sister, because my sister is 16 and (one) wanted to go with her.”
In late April, she headed for the bus station in the border city of McAllen, her 4-month old daughter strapped to her chest in the same cloth sling she used throughout their 2,000-mile journey, and carrying a notice to show up in court near relatives in Los Angeles."

In a vast joint effort, navies from the United Kingdom, Sweden, Spain, and Italy rescued 3,500 migrants on Saturday, even as the European Union debates how to handle the influx of refugees once they come ashore. The rescued migrants will be taken to Sicily.
The United Nations estimates that as many as 90,000 refugees and migrants have been rescued or sailed to safety and crossed into Europe so far this year. Most of these migrants have landed in Italy, Greece, Spain and Malta.
Desperate to flee persecution and violence in Libya and Sub-Saharan Africa, many of the migrants paid smugglers to board wooden and rubber ships to Europe. The voyages have already claimed thousands of lives this year.
Additionally, The International Organisation for Migration estimates that 1,850 migrant lives have been lost at sea since the beginning of 2015.
Many European countries have become increasingly unwilling to give migrants food and shelter in their regions, as the asylum requests for thousands continue to be evaluated.
In Italy, right-wing politicians and local community officials have voiced strong opposition to the migrants, saying they would not accept any more “illegal immigrants,” because the reception facilities for the migrants had already reached maximum capacity."

Fleeing war, poverty and persecution in Africa and the Middle East, the migrants are trying to sail to Europe, where more than 80,000 have landed so far this year. The United Nations says more than 35,000 migrants have arrived in Italy alone since January.

The graves were in Perlis state in northern Malaysia, not far from other graves containing 30 bodies that Thai authorities discovered in May.
Thousands of people have arrived in Thailand and Malaysia by boat in recent weeks. The authorities said they believe the most recently discovered bodies were of Rohingya Muslims from Myanmar and Bangladeshis seeking work in Malaysia. Some of the bodies showed signs of torture.
Researchers said smugglers often hold the migrants in camps as they demand further payment from other family members, sometimes beating them to increase the pressure, reported the New York Times.
It can cost an additional $1,200 to $1,800 before the migrants are released from the camps, past Reuters investigations found.

Rescuers led by the Italian Coast Guard are still searching for bodies and the death count is expected to rise. The disaster could be the deadliest migrant trip across the Mediterranean yet.
At a meeting in Luxembourg today, European Union foreign ministers attempted to come up with a more humane policy to deal with the migrants, but the group has struggled to come to a cohesive plan. The interior minister of Latvia, which holds the EU’s rotating presidency, suggested creating a permanent search and rescue team, but many worry that will increase the number of migrants attempting the journey.
“Search and rescue alone is not a silver bullet,” German Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere told Reuters. “If you just organize search and rescue, criminals who get the refugees on board will send more boats.”
This year, as many as 1800 migrants have died trying to make the voyage, according to Reuters.
Many of these migrants attempt the perilous voyage in an effort to flee violence and poverty in war-ravaged countries like Syria, Iraq, Somalia and Libya. A spate of violence in recent months and more favorable weather has increased the number of people trying to cross to Europe. Malta and Italy, the closest countries to the African Coast, have received the brunt of the immigration wave.
But European countries facing a tough economic climate at home are struggling to respond. Last year Italy shut down a navy operation on its southern coast because of high costs and domestic pressure to curb the number of immigrants attempting to cross.
British Prime Minister David Cameron suggested the battle should be against the traffickers, who pack unstable boats with hundreds of people that pay absurd fees for the trip.
“We should put the blame squarely with the criminal human traffickers who are the ones managing, promoting and selling this trade, this trade in human life,” he told the Associated Press.
Police in Italy said they broke up a major smuggling ring and issued arrest warrants for 24 people, 14 of them in Italy."
https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/migrants-control-one-powerful-global-economic-engines,migrant,1261,2015-04-13T12:08:45-04:00,Laura Santhanam,How migrants control one of the world’s most powerful economic engines,"When Dilip Ratha arrived in the United States in 1990, he had $20 in his pocket and a plan to send money back home. Only with strict discipline could Ratha stretch his $600-a-month in wages far enough to mail a check to his family in Sindhekela, a village in India’s northeastern state of Orissa.
Each month, half of the $600 paid rent for a shared apartment in Philadelphia. $100 paid for phone calls home at a cost of $1 per minute (As the first person in his family to leave his village, he cherished those phone calls, despite the cost). Another $50 to $70 went to his father and brother. With the little money left over, he bought food.
“It was literally a hand-to-mouth kind of thing. I was paid every 15 days, and I had planned it out for a few months, counting every dollar to manage the deposit,” said Ratha, who is now an economist at the World Bank.
Ratha was also one of the first people to track worldwide remittances, the money migrants regularly send back to the developing world. His story is becoming increasingly common as more people crisscross the globe for work and send home the money they earn.
An estimated 247 million people worldwide lived in countries where they were not born in 2013, the latest time period with available data, according to newly released data from the World Bank.
Within that group, migrants sent $436 billion in remittances to the developing world in 2014, up from $418 billion over the previous year, the data show.
For comparison, that is more than three times the combined amount of official development aid that the world’s wealthiest nations sent the developing world in 2014, which was about $135 billion, virtually unchanged from the year before, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.
Here’s why that is a big deal. Remittances are widely seen as one of the most stable forms of aid, even more than what one nation may send to another, an amount that can change given the donor country’s political or economic climate.
These deposits represent promises to help family and friends left back home while the migrant works in a foreign land. Failing to send money home could mean one’s loved ones can no longer afford to send a child to school or pay the rent or eat.
Unlike major non-profit organizations or government agencies that specialize in foreign aid, when a migrant sends a remittance, that money goes directly to his or her loved one, acting as precision-targeted development assistance.
In fact, people who study remittances want to develop policy based on that reliable flow of money from migrants. Migrant spending often prioritizes long-term benefit for a family, such as saving money to build or buy a house, start a business, or send a child to school. The subject is of particular interest to Dean Yang, an associate professor of public policy and economics at the University of Michigan who surveyed migrants and their families about remittances.
“Migrants are more interested in helping create a better future,” he said. “Recipients tend to be much more interested in spending on more immediate consumption needs.”
Yang thinks that if migrants were to gain more control over how the money gets spent, the results could translate into wiser use of money among the families receiving it and strengthen communities one household at a time.
He saw this play out in an experiment that surveyed 1,986 migrant workers in the United States who sent money to to 1,338 households in El Salvador.
Migrant workers could open, monitor and control the amount of money in the account they shared with their family. While they couldn’t prevent the family from emptying the account, they could say, “I know you did that,” Yang said.
After 18 months, households saw dramatic savings, he said. In the experiment, if migrants held both a savings account and a joint bank account with the person receiving remittances in El Salvador, the ability to save increased by an average of $282.
There are more migrants in the United States than anywhere else, and they sent more money abroad than from any other country, adding up to an estimated $131 billion in remittances last year, according to the World Bank’s latest data. Nations that benefited the most from these dollars are Mexico, China and India.
Usually, remittances from the United States are sent via money-wiring services that are not banks, such as Western Union or MoneyGram, which charge a fee to do business.
But a bill before Congress seeks to increase that added cost of sending remittances.
In January, Senator David Vitter (R-LA) proposed the Remittance Status Verification Act of 2015, a law that would fine a person attempting to send a remittance if that person were unable to verify their legal status in this country. The fine would equal 7 percent of the amount sent.
Under the proposed law, if a person tried to send the average remittance of $200, but was unable to show sufficient legal identification, they could be fined $14. Add that to remittance fees for that same amount of money, which normally fall between $5 to $10.
Vitter has said that such a fine would help enforce immigration laws. “My legislation would help us figure out how many foreign workers are here illegally and make them pay for wiring money back home,” he said.
Others say that if passed, this law could place a burden not only on the person sending the remittance but also money wiring companies.
“It would be horrible,” said David Landsman, executive director for the National Money Transmitters Association. “7 percent is enough money to make most corporations tread over their own grandmothers,” Landsman said. “7 percent is a significant difference. It’s not a trivial amount.”
This would likely result in an increase in illegal money transfers, such as hand-delivered cash, shipping parcels filled with hidden money or the use of unlicensed operators, he said.
“I believe that in about three years, people will start talking about federalizing regulation for our business. It’s way too complex at this moment,” Landsman said. “You have mobile, plastic, Internet. There are so many ways to do money transfer that are just burgeoning.”
He defended the fees that money transfer services already charge.
“It’s not only that people think we charge too much, but people have a disproportionate idea about what expenses are,” Landsman said.
Ratha with the World Bank says these fees are simply too much for migrants living on a tight budget.
Today, he takes his case through the World Bank to the United Nations in New York City as part of a drafting meeting for the 48th Session of the Commission on Population and Development, where the development community is gathering to determine what the world’s goals for 2030 should be. The United Nation’s Millennium Development Goals made 15 years ago prioritized clean drinking water for all, gender equality and measures to reduce poverty by half. Further discussion will take place in Addis Ababa in July during the Third International Conference on Financing for Development.
Now, the commission is exploring how to address population issues and sustainable development. Among questions the commission will consider addressing: should the world work to reduce remittance fees so that migrants can send even more money home? Ratha thinks so.
“If you reduce remittance costs, you could generate $20 billion per year in additional funding, putting that money in the hands of poor people who might send it home,” he said."
https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/number-child-migrants-border-declining,migrant,320,2014-09-03T13:56:16-04:00,"Alicia A. Caldwell, Associated Press",Number of child migrants crossing the border declines,"WASHINGTON — The number of immigrant children caught alone illegally crossing the Mexican border into the United States continued to decline in August, according to figures disclosed Wednesday by the Homeland Security Department.
Last month Border Patrol agents apprehended 3,129 children, mostly from Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala. In July agents found more than 5,400 children, while in June the number was more than 10,600.
The Obama administration has been cautious about speculating over what led to the recent decline, saying several factors are likely at play. Historically, the number of immigrants caught crossing the border illegally declines during the hottest summer months.
Since the start of the budget year in October, more than 66,000 unaccompanied children have apprehended crossing the border illegally, nearly double the number from the 2013 budget year.
The dramatic increase in the number of child immigrants this year prompted the administration to step up enforcement efforts against human smuggling rings and launch a public relations campaign urging parents in Central America not to send their children on the dangerous trek through Mexico. The Justice Department has also ordered that newly arrived child immigrants facing deportation hearings should have their cases moved to the top of the federal immigration court’s docket. The court has a backlog of more than 375,000 pending cases.
Officials in Mexico last month starting pulling Central Americans off the top of a lumbering freight train known as “La Bestia,” or The Beast, which has routinely carried thousands of migrants north toward the U.S. border.
The crush of Central American children found crossing the border caught the administration off guard earlier this year and strained Homeland Security’s resources. President Barack Obama called the situation a humanitarian crisis and asked Congress to approve an emergency $3.7 billion spending bill to deal with the issue. Congress left Washington for the August recess before the Republican-controlled House and Democratic-led Senate could agree on a spending package."
https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/feds-closing-emergency-shelters-child-migrants,migrant,391,2014-08-04T13:30:19-04:00,"Alicia A. Caldwell, Associated Press",Feds closing emergency shelters for child migrants,"WASHINGTON — The government said Monday it will soon close three emergency shelters it established at U.S. military bases to temporarily house children caught crossing the Mexican border alone. It said fewer children were being caught and other shelters will be adequate.
A shelter in Oklahoma at Fort Sill is expected to close as early as Friday, the Health and Human Services Department said. Shelters in Texas at Joint Base San Antonio-Lackland and in California at Naval Base Ventura County-Port Hueneme will wrap up operations in the next two to eight weeks, agency spokesman Kenneth Wolfe said. About 7,700 children had been housed at the three military bases since shelters there opened in May and early June. They stayed an average of 35 days.
Since Oct. 1 more than 57,000 unaccompanied children, mostly from Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala, have been caught crossing the Mexican border illegally.
A 2008 law requires that unaccompanied child immigrants from countries that don’t border the United States be handed over to the Health and Human Services Department within 72 hours of being apprehended. The children are cared for by the government until they can be reunited with a relative or another sponsor in the United States while they await a deportation hearing in immigration court.
The crush of Central American children caught at the border in recent months has strained resources across the government and prompted President Barack Obama to ask Congress to approve an emergency $3.7 billion spending bill to deal with what he described as a humanitarian crisis. Congress adjourned for the August recess without acting on the request.
Last month the Homeland Security Department reported that the number of child immigrants crossing the border alone had started to decline, from as many as 2,000 each week in June to about 500 each week in mid-July. Administration officials said at the time that multiple factors likely contributed to the decline.
The number of people caught crossing the border illegally typically declines during the hottest summer months.
Administration officials have said as many 90,000 child immigrants could cross the border by the end of the budget year in September.
The military base shelters could reopen if the number of young border crossers spikes again in the near future, Wolfe said.

The bill will cost $659 million through the end of this fiscal year, far smaller than the $3.7 billion requested by President Barack Obama and a sharp reduction from the $1.5 billion initially proposed by the House spending committee.
The cuts were designed to win over skeptical conservatives and give lawmakers something they could pass before leaving Washington at the end of this week for their annual August recess.
“I think there’s sufficient support in the House to move this bill,” House Speaker John Boehner told reporters Tuesday after meeting with rank-and-file lawmakers on the issue. “We have a little more work to do though.”
Boehner said the bill would come to a vote on Thursday.
Numerous House Republicans have said in recent weeks that they did not want to go back to their districts to face voters without acting to deal with the crisis of tens of thousands of kids and teens showing up at the South Texas border, many fleeing vicious gangs and trying to reunite with family members.
Lawmakers said Tuesday that the measure appeared to enjoy widespread support, although some conservatives said they remained opposed.
“Frankly, we need to show that we can act and act thoughtfully, responsibly and quickly,” said Rep. Tom Cole, R-Okla. “Clean up the mess that the administration has created. I think the worst thing for us would have been to write a blank check which the president wanted us to do.”"

We take a step-by-step look at their journey once they enter the U.S.
Step One: Arrival
The child turns himself in to a U.S. border patrol agent, phone number of a relative in hand. If he is deemed an “unaccompanied child”, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ Office of Refugee Resettlement takes custody of the child and places him in a shelter. From there, he contacts relatives or a family friend to come get him at their own expense. Before the child is released, the family member undergoes a criminal background check.
The above video looks at the influx of migrants at the U.S. border.
Step Two: Orientation
The child migrants’ family members or other custodians attend an orientation program, offered by the Department of Justice’s Executive Office for Immigration Review. There, they learn about their legal rights and get a list of pro bono attorneys who can help guide them through family and immigration courts. The EOIR keeps track of the number of immigration court cases, but doesn’t separate out cases involving minors.
The child migrants also might seek asylum in the United States, which doesn’t require going through court. Instead, they present their case at asylum offices under the Department of Homeland Security.
Step Three: Legal consultation
After getting the general information about the U.S. legal system at the orientation session, the migrants can choose to meet with an immigration attorney like Jennifer Girard with Catholic Charities, Archdiocese of Washington’s legal services. Other organizations assisting child migrants include Kids in Need of Defense and Ayuda.
“We give them advice on what type of case we think they might have. After that, they can either remain on our waiting list, we can give them a referral list of private attorneys, or help them seek pro-bono representation, depending on their ability to pay,” said Girard. Even if some of the services are free, the migrants still face a cost of at least $3,000 to go through the entire legal process, plus additional filing fees charged by the U.S. government, she said.
If a child doesn’t have a lawyer, the judge can grant continuances to give him time to get one.
A city in New Mexico is divided over sheltering immigrants awaiting deportation.
Step Four: Applying for a new status
Special immigrant juvenile status is available to children who have been abandoned, abused, or neglected by one or both parents; asylum is an option for those afraid they will be persecuted at home based on race, religion, nationality, political opinion or membership in a particular social group.
“Most of the children we see in our consultations are afraid of gang violence if they were to return, and most have experienced some kind of violence already in their home countries” of Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador, said Girard.
A U.N. report ranking countries’ homicide rates in 2013 shows Honduras as first, and El Salvador and Guatemala in the top five. More than 52,000 unaccompanied children have arrived at the U.S. southern border since the current fiscal year began Oct. 1, 2013, three-quarters of them from these three countries, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection.
Once receiving asylum status or special immigrant juvenile status, the child can apply for permanent residency in the United States. The children can go through this process whether or not their parents are legally in the United States, Girard said. The entire legal process takes an average of two years.

https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/bill,migrant,455,2014-07-14T14:23:29-04:00,"Erica Werner, Associated Press",Bill would expedite removal of child migrants from Central America,"WASHINGTON — Two Texas lawmakers announced legislation Monday to speed removals of tens of thousands of Central American kids from the U.S.-Mexico border, as Washington groped for a solution to the mounting crisis.
Legislation brought forward by Sen. John Cornyn, a Republican, and Rep. Henry Cuellar, a Democrat, would allow U.S. Border Patrol agents to turn many of the kids around quickly at the border. Under current law, the youths stay here while awaiting an eventual hearing in the backlogged immigration court system, something that can keep them in this country for years.
Of more than 57,000 unaccompanied minors who’ve arrived at the border since October, only 1,254 had been returned home as of the end of June, according to a law enforcement official who spoke anonymously to discuss confidential data.
“The border region in Texas has been overwhelmed over the past few months by a deluge of undocumented immigrants from Central America,” Cuellar said in a statement. “Today’s legislation strengthens current law protecting unaccompanied children and responds to the crisis.”
The bill comes as the White House is trying to get Congress to sign off on a $3.7 billion emergency spending request to deal with the situation at the border by adding more immigration judges and detention facilities, among other steps.
Republicans have made clear they won’t agree to such spending without policy changes along the lines of what Cornyn and Cuellar are seeking, and the White House has indicated support for some such changes. But immigrant advocacy groups and key Senate Democrats are opposed, making it unclear if a deal can be struck in the three weeks that remain before Congress leaves Washington for its annual August recess.
The Cornyn-Cuellar bill would amend a 2008 law passed to address victims of sex trafficking. That legislation guaranteed protections to unaccompanied youths arriving here from “noncontiguous” countries — anywhere except Mexico or Canada. The existing law requires such youths to be turned over to the custody of the Health and Human Services Department within 72 hours, and from there they are generally placed with family members or others while awaiting a long-distant court hearing they may never attend.
The Cornyn-Cuellar bill would allow Central American kids to be treated the same as those from Mexico, whose people can be sent back over the border quickly unless they are able to persuade Border Patrol agents that they have a fear of return, meriting further screening.
White House and Obama administration officials have said they support this change, but in face of objections from allies in the immigrant advocacy community they have yet to propose it officially. Spokesman Josh Earnest said the White House welcomes “constructive engagement from Republicans” but will wait to see the actual legislation."

The aid organization has set up clinics along migration routes to the border in southern and central Mexico to provide medical and mental health services. Fifty-eight percent of the migrants said they experienced one or more incidents of violence on their journey north, according to 396 patients surveyed from July 2013 to February 2014.
“Our teams in Mexico have seen people beaten while they are using the cargo train, known as ‘La Bestia’ or ‘The Beast’ in English,” as well as cases of sexual violence perpetrated by either the smugglers or other migrants, said Marc Bosch, Doctors Without Borders’ head of mission in Mexico, based in Mexico City.

In 2013, the organization treated 11,323 migrants mostly from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador. The majority were men age 18 to 25, while 13 percent were women, and 9 percent were minors — an increase from past years, said Bosch.
In response to the influx of unaccompanied minors trying to enter the United States, President Obama is seeking $3.7 billion from Congress to increase border surveillance; bulk up detention, care and transportation systems for unaccompanied children; and increase the capacity of immigration courts.
In June, Vice President Joe Biden visited Guatemala with the message that the United States would start detaining families instead of releasing them on their own recognizance.
But the announcement has had no noticeable consequences in the field, said Bosch. “People are still leaving the Central American countries and a significant number are leaving because of violence. We don’t expect any change soon based on these kinds of positions.”

Doctors Without Borders doesn’t try to deter the steady stream of migrants, nor does it view itself as encouraging them. “They make the decision (to leave) because they encountered violence, or want a better life, or to reunite with their families in the U.S.,” said Bosch. “It’s not a decision being taken by the fact that someone is assisting on the route. We are just providing basic humanitarian assistance.”
The group provides the migrants with maps of the safest routes and of hostels where they can get shelter along the way, he said.
About two-thirds of the migrants say they’re heading north to improve their economic situation, while about one-third cite violence in their home country as one of their reasons for leaving, said Bosch. At home, gangs could be trying to recruit them, or they have been threatened or forced to pay extortions. But the violence often doesn’t stop there. The migrants have reported muggings, theft, sexual attacks and kidnappings by criminal gangs they encounter during their travels, he said.

As part of its treatment programs, Doctors Without Borders provides mental health consultations. The migrants aren’t seeking the mental health services, said Bosch, but after aid workers talk to them, it becomes clear they are needed.
The migrants are given what Bosch calls “one-shot” mental health sessions, because they’re only briefly passing through. In one hour, health workers try to provide the migrants with coping mechanisms to survive their journey.
Bosch said according to his teams in the field, nearly 42 percent of the migrants have symptoms related to anxiety, 26 percent of the symptoms are related to depression, 12 percent are psychosomatic — or stress-induced, and 11 percent are post-traumatic disorders.
He said U.S. and Mexican governments should take into account that many migrants feel they have to leave their homes. “We are talking about people who cannot go back home, because a significant portion of them are scared about what might happen.”

https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/child-migrant-crisis-pushes-humanitarian-legal-boundaries-u-s,migrant,775,2014-07-07T15:49:28-04:00,"Charles Babington, Associated Press",Child migrant crisis pushes humanitarian and legal boundaries for U.S.,"WASHINGTON — The White House said Monday that most unaccompanied children arriving at the U.S.-Mexico border are unlikely to qualify for humanitarian relief that would prevent them from being sent back from their home countries.
The pointed warning came as the White House finalized a spending request to Congress detailing the additional resources President Barack Obama wants in order to hire more immigration judges and open additional detention facilities to deal with the border crisis. White House officials said they planned to send the more than $2 billion request to lawmakers on Tuesday.
White House spokesman Josh Earnest said that while the administration will allow the immigration review process to take place, officials so far don’t expect many of the children arriving at the border to be able to stay in the U.S.
“It’s unlikely that most of these kids will qualify for humanitarian relief,” Earnest said. “It means they will not have a legal basis for remaining in this country and will be returned.”
Still, it’s unclear how quickly that process will unfold. Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson acknowledged Sunday that such proceedings might be long delayed, and he said that coping with floods of unaccompanied minors crossing the border is a legal and humanitarian dilemma for the United States.
“Our border is not open to illegal migration, and we are taking a number of steps to address it, including turning people around faster,” Johnson told NBC’s “Meet the Press.” At the same time, he said, the administration is “looking at ways to create additional options for dealing with the children in particular, consistent with our laws and our values.”
Repeatedly pressed to say whether thousands of Central American children will be deported promptly, Johnson said, “We need to find more efficient, effective ways to turn this tide around generally, and we’ve already begun to do that.”
Most are from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador, where spikes in violence and poverty are prompting parents to send their children on difficult and dangerous journeys north.
Their numbers have overwhelmed federal agencies. When 140 would-be immigrants — mostly mothers with children — were flown to southern California to ease an overcrowded Texas facility, angry residents of Murrieta, California, greeted the bus as it pulled into town, complaining that they were being saddled with more than their share.
“This is a failure of diplomacy. It is a failure of leadership from the administration,” said Texas Gov. Rick Perry, who sought the 2012 GOP presidential nomination.
Rep. Henry Cuellar, D-Texas, said the administration “is one step behind” a major dilemma that was foreseeable. The number of children coming from Central America without adults has been rising dramatically for several years.
A George W. Bush-era law to address human trafficking prevents the government from returning these children to their home countries without taking them into custody and eventually through a deportation hearing. Minors from Mexico and Canada, by contrast, can be sent back across the border more easily. The administration says it wants more flexibility under the law.
Johnson said the administration has dramatically sped up the processing of adults who enter the country illegally, and it is opening more detention facilities. He acknowledged that the unaccompanied children from Central America, some 9,700 taken into custody in May alone, pose the most vexing problem.
Unaccompanied Central American children generally are being released to relatives already in the United States. Mothers with their children often are released with a notice to appear later in immigration court.
Meanwhile, word of seemingly successful border crossings reaches their home countries, encouraging others to try.
Johnson said the U.S. government is trying to send the message that all people who enter the country illegally will face deportation proceedings eventually. In Central America, he said, “the criminal smuggling organizations are putting out a lot of disinformation about supposed free passes into this country” that will expire soon. “We’re cracking down on the smuggling organizations by surging law enforcement resources,” Johnson said.
Johnson and others are warning of the dangers that immigrants, and especially children, face when the try to reach the United States on their own. Johnson is scheduled to meet with Guatemalan officials later this week.
Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said children entering the country illegally must be sent home. If not, Graham said, “you’re going to incentivize people throughout that part of the world to keep sending their children here.”
Graham said foreign aid should be cut off to countries that don’t do more to discourage illegal immigration to the United States.
Perry appeared on ABC’s “This Week”; Cuellar was on CNN’s “State of the Union”; Graham was on CBS’ “Face the Nation.”"
https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/boehner-calls-migrant-influx-national-security-crisis,migrant,402,2014-06-20T11:21:05-04:00,"Erica Werner, Associated Press",Boehner calls migrant influx ‘national security’ crisis,"WASHINGTON — House Speaker John Boehner urged President Barack Obama Friday to send National Guard troops to the southern border to help deal with the surge of unaccompanied minors from Central America, calling it a “national security and humanitarian crisis.”
In a letter to the president, Boehner blamed Obama administration policies for the huge increase in children making their way here from Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras, and said the president must act.
Boehner said National Guard troops could help ensure the safety of the children and their families. And he said the State Department should work with Central American nations to help speed processing times to return children and families to their countries and to make sure that people know of the dangers of heading north.
“The policies of your administration have directly resulted in the belief by these immigrants that once they reach U.S. soil, they will be able to stay here indefinitely,” Boehner wrote.
“While we understand that many of these individuals are coming to this country to escape violence and hardship in their home country, the current climate along the border and our enforcement policies are only encouraging them to risk their lives and those of their children. It is time that we confront the crisis along the border head-on through immediate and aggressive action.”
The Border Patrol says the number of minors coming from Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras has soared more than 1,000 percent. Administration officials have said it’s largely because of conditions in their home countries, but there’s also a belief among some of the migrants that they would be allowed to stay once in the U.S.
The White House had no immediate response to Boehner.
The speaker’s letter underscores that the issue has increasingly become a political problem for the Obama administration, which had hoped to spend the spring and summer pressuring House Republicans to pass comprehensive immigration legislation but is now increasingly occupied with the unaccompanied minor issue.
Boehner made no mention in his letter of immigration legislation and the House appears to have no inclination to move on it, particularly after the surprise primary defeat last week of Majority Leader Eric Cantor at the hands of a conservative who accused him of supporting “amnesty.”
PBS NewsHour will have more on the influx of migrants and what it means for children who cross the border unaccompanied by a parent on Friday night’s show."

Thousands of African migrants protested in Tel Aviv, Israel on Sunday and launched a three day strike in the service industries where many are illegally employed. The migrants want refugee status and an end to anti-immigration policies in Israel. The Israeli government has taken a strong anti-immigration position, and recently passed legislation allowing migrants to be detained for up to a year without a trial.

A recent investigation by The Guardian newspaper has raised serious allegations against the country of Qatar regarding the deaths of dozens of Nepalese laborers in recent weeks. Nepalese migrant workers account for about 40 percent of Qatar’s migrant workforce.
The country is also feverishly working on a massive infrastructure project in preparation for the 2022 FIFA World Cup that is to be hosted in Qatar with the labor being provided by Nepalese workers. According to the Nepalese embassy in Doha, 44 workers have died between June 4 and Aug. 8 with most of them dying of heart attacks, heart failure, or workplace accidents. The investigations leveled accusations of lack of pay, long work hours in the desert heat without food, drink and rest, and being beaten and abused by the project supervisors when they asked for basic sustenance. The workers have their passports and documents taken away so they are considered illegal aliens and cannot leave the country motivating about 30 Nepalese workers to reach out to the embassy in Doha for assistance and refuge.
The Qatari Labour Ministry responded by saying that it has strict laws governing labor in the heat and payment for services. These revelations about a system of “modern-day slavery” could result, among many other consequences, in Qatar losing the 2022 World Cup."

https://www.pbs.org/newshour/arts/social_issues-july-dec08-waterstations_09-16,migrant,856,2008-09-16T17:15:00-04:00,PBS NewsHour,Tribe Divided Over Providing Water to Illegal Migrants Crossing Indian Land,"The pair of humanitarian aid workers refused. But when they returned to the border area days later, they found three of their water stations had been removed.
“It’s unconscionable that the Tohono O’odham tribal council not only does absolutely nothing to prevent migrant deaths but are now confiscating my water stations,” said Wilson. “That’s the situation that I’m in.”
The Tohono O’odham Nation is the second largest Indian reservation in the country and shares 76 miles of border with Mexico. Located in one of the most active corridors for illegal border activity, the Tohono O’odham Nation is also home to nearly half of all migrant deaths that occur in the state of Arizona.
Wilson and Garcia have ignored orders to stop putting out water in the Baboquivari district on the Tohono O’odham Nation since 2002. The pair operates a total of six water stations for migrants: five on the U.S. ground of the Tohono O’odham reservation and one just across the border in Mexico. The pair works with humanitarian aid organization Humane Borders to put water in areas used by migrants illegally entering the United States — areas that have historically seen high rates of deaths associated with dehydration.
“The Tohono O’odham tribal government has a moral responsibility to prevent migrant deaths on Tohono O’odham tribal lands,” said Wilson. “We as native people must be held equally accountable as every other citizen in this country and the moral bar must be just as high for us as anyone else.”
Eight years ago, Humane Borders President Robin Hoover approached the tribe about putting water stations on the reservation. The tribe refused to allow the organization to operate on tribal land, claiming their activities would attract more migrants.
Despite the tribe’s refusal to work with Humane Borders, Wilson put the water stations out anyway. Humane Borders funds his efforts, but the stations on the reservation are technically not operated by the humanitarian group itself.
In July 2002, the Baboquivari district passed a resolution to stop Wilson from putting water on the reservation, but never enforced it. Wilson believes public pressure and media support allowed him to continue without harassment.
“The O’odham will tell us that they’re afraid of the migrants because they’ll come driving through at all hours of the day and night. They’ll say they spend a lot of money on search and rescue, which they do. They’ll say they spend a lot of money on getting people re-hydrated,” said Robin Hoover. “The truth of the matter is that if anything that they say is true that’s all the more reason to put water stations out there because you can direct people away from the communities, spend less money on search and rescue, spend less money on re-hydration, and you wouldn’t have as many people in conflict in the little communities.”
Several calls were made to Tohono O’odham officials, the Baboquivari District and tribal public relations officers for comment, but none were returned. Both the United States and the Tohono O’odham have jurisdiction over border security in the area, however, the Tohono O’odham tribal council and its eleven district chairpersons have final say over the reservation’s lands and its uses.
“I’m calling this confiscation of the water stations crimes against humanity,” said Wilson. “I’ve been saying that for several years, and I’m saying it again: to remove the water stations on the Tohono O’odham Nation is a crime against humanity.”
According to Sarah Paoletti, Wilson may have a legitimate human rights argument. Paoletti is the director of the Trans-National Legal Clinic at the University of Pennsylvania.
“I think for advocates representing migrants the argument is that actions are being taken that are going to deprive [an] individual’s right to life,” said Paoletti. “There is knowledge that without providing water, given the numbers of people dying in the desert and the numbers of those deaths attributable to hypothermia and dehydration, that the U.S. has an affirmative obligation to ensure that an individual’s life is protected.”
Despite the tribe’s efforts to physically remove water stations, Wilson says he will return to replace them as well as move to open dialogue with tribal officials. “If that doesn’t work, I plan to organize a boycott of the Tohono O’odham tribal casinos,” said Wilson. “If the tribal council does not respond to public pressure they will respond immediately to the threat of economic pressure.”
Two of the Tohono O’odham’s three casinos are located in the Tuscon area and are the main source of income for the tribe.
“It’s extreme,” said Wilson, “but I’m tired of 80 or 90 migrants dying on the nation and the nation looking the other way.”
According to border patrol records, between January and June of this year, 83 bodies were recovered on Tohono O’odham lands.
“Whether [migrants] have water or not there are other reasons why these individuals are trying to come into this country,” said Paoletti. “We can debate immigration policy and we can debate about whether or not certain individuals have a right to be in this country, but I don’t think that the debate should be whether or not they die on the border.”"

Martha McSally, wore a maroon-and-gold Arizona State University T-shirt and jeans as she belted out the national anthem at the school’s homecoming game Saturday. The Democrat, Rep. Kyrsten Sinema, wore a canary-yellow dress and 8-inch platform shoes with cactus applique as she presided over the coin toss.
But the crowd of 46,000 greeted both U.S. Senate candidates the same way: with a mix of cheers and boos.
It was a fitting kickoff to the final weekend before the 2018 midterms , a campaign that seemingly launched the day after Donald Trump was elected president two years ago that is climaxing in the shadow of a bomb plot targeting Democratic leaders and the worst anti-Semitic shooting in U.S. history. Each side is doing everything it can to mobilize voters, warning of the dire consequences of failure.

Democrats are counting on wresting control of the House from Republicans and hoping for a longshot series of wins to take back the Senate as well. But Republicans are optimistic they can gain seats in a Senate map heavy on red states and haven’t given up on holding the House.
Neither side wanted to leave anything on the field in the final weekend. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee spent $650,000 in the final stretch on advertising on African-American radio stations to mobilize black voters.
Voters in both parties said they were paying attention.
“I’ve never been so sleepless, so restless as I have been” since Trump was elected, Sudi Farokhnia, a risk manager in Orange County, California, said before leaving a rally to volunteer for Democratic congressional candidate Katie Porter, who is challenging Republican Rep. Mimi Walters.
Brandon Evans, 36, was cleaning out his parents’ storage room in the Salt Lake City suburb of West Jordan on Saturday when he got an unexpected visit from his Republican congresswoman, Mia Love. Love, who faces a tough re-election challenge, traveled through her largely suburban district in an orange-and-blue modified motor scooter, knocking on every door she could.
Evans assured her she had his vote because of gun rights. “I feel like they’re under attack more than they’ve ever been,” Evans said.

Campaigns pulled out the heavy hitters. Trump continued to hopscotch the nation, holding a rally in Montana for GOP Senate candidate Matt Rosendale, who is challenging Democratic Sen. Jon Tester, and another rally for GOP candidates in Florida. Vice President Mike Pence traveled from Kansas to Wisconsin to Florida getting out the vote for Republicans.
At a Pence event outside Kansas City on Friday, Ronald Solomon, a 59-year-old investment banker from Las Vegas who sells Trump memorabilia, was incredulous that the GOP could lose seats, given the economy.
“There are better jobs. There are more jobs. People are getting bonuses — they’re getting raises,” Solomon said.
At a Pence rally Saturday on behalf of Republican Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, Sue Hodgson, of River Falls, said she was “nervous more than excited.” The group around Hodgson, who was sporting a star-spangled, down-filled jacket, nodded.
“We’re here to show our support,” Hodgson said. “I just hope it’s enough.”
In the Democratic stronghold of Madison, about 250 miles (400 kilometers) away, the smell of barbecue pervaded a labor hall where Democratic volunteers spent Saturday night phoning voters. Eighteen-year-old Katherine Morgan let out a squeak of joy when she learned that not only had the man she called already voted, but he also had a sign for Tony Evers, the Democratic gubernatorial nominee, in his front yard.
“I want to be changing things day in and day out,” the University of Wisconsin freshman said. “You can’t complain if you don’t contribute.”
In West Palm Beach, Florida, just a few miles from Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate, legendary singer Jimmy Buffett tried to fire up Democrats for gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum and Sen. Bill Nelson. He tweaked the words to some of his old favorites.
“Come Tuesday, things will change,” Buffett sang, swapping the date in his famous song “Come Monday.” ″Come Tuesday, we’re making a change. It’s been two insane years and it’s time to really switch gears …”
It was a different tune but the same idea in Kansas City’s jazz district, where Glenn Jones performed his hit song “We’ve Only Just Begun” and danced down the aisles of the Gem Theater to fire up a predominantly African-American crowd for Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill of Missouri.
Andre Lockett, 48, said he’s been trying to talk to younger people about the importance of showing up for Tuesday’s elections.
“My mother and grandmother didn’t live to see the first African-American president, and they would have been proud,” he said. “But now it looks like we’re going backwards, and I’m ashamed of where we’re at in this country right now.”
In Arizona, the Senate race has dominated the state. McSally, a former combat pilot, has accused Sinema of “treason” for comments about the Afghanistan War in 2002 while Democrats have been hammering McSally over her vote to repeal President Barack Obama’s health care law.
Lately, as Trump has tried to raise fear of a caravan of Central American migrants trying to cross Mexico on foot to reach the U.S. border, McSally has taken to slamming Sinema on immigration. Those thoughts were on the mind of Stephen Ovanessoff, a retired church deacon and pathologist, at a church visited by Republican Rep. David Schweikert as part of the congressman’s own get-out-the-vote efforts Saturday.
“There should definitively be a strong border, especially for a country like the United States,” said Ovanessoff, who emigrated from Iraq. “Because if you go outside to other countries, there are millions and millions of people everywhere that want to come and live in this country.”
In Tempe, outside Sun Devil Stadium, where thousands gathered wearing the team’s bright yellow colors, Sinema was mobbed by well-wishers asking for hugs and selfies. Sinema teaches two courses on social work at the university and has multiple degrees from the school, and was widely recognized, even by ticket scalpers.
One student gushed to Sinema, “I’ve heard your ads on Spotify.” One man confided to her: “You’re the most qualified candidate, but I can’t vote for you — I’m a Republican, my wife would kill me.” A scalper wished Sinema luck, leading the delighted candidate to cry: “We’ve got the scalper vote!”
Gina Kilker was making her way through the crowd when she cried out, “Oh, my God, that’s Kyrsten Sinema.” Soon the candidate was posing with Kilker, her husband, daughter and son-in-law.
“We did not expect to see her,” Kilker said. She tried to sum up her emotions about the last two years and boiled it down to: “We’re hoping and praying for a blue wave.”

He is providing no evidence to support his claim.
The video shows a Latino man in court, smiling menacingly. His words are clear: He’s killed cops and he’s “gonna kill more cops soon.”
The man in the video, Luis Bracamontes, is an immigrant in the country illegally who was convicted this year of murdering two law enforcement officials.
The expletive-filled video was immediately denounced by some Democrats and Republicans alike as racist.
Bracamontes, a twice-deported immigrant from Mexico, was sentenced to death in California for the 2014 killings. The 53-second spot includes expletives uttered by Bracamontes during his trial as he professed regret at not killing more officers.
“Illegal immigrant, Luis Bracamontes, killed our people!” the video states, adding, “Democrats let him into our country … Democrats let him stay.” It includes scenes of a migrant caravan moving toward the U.S., warning ominously, “Who else would Democrats let in?”
A caravan traveling from Honduras and making its way toward the U.S. began is made up of about 4,000 migrants who are reportedly fleeing violence and poverty in their home countries. The caravan is 900 miles away from the U.S. border. A similar caravan headed for the U.S. received widespread attention in April. Its numbers shrank from more than 1,000 to about 200 before it reached the U.S.
Research shows immigration is not associated with increases in crime, and commit fewer crimes than native-born Americans.
The ad was reminiscent of the infamous “Willie Horton” ad used against Democratic presidential candidate Michael Dukakis in 1988 and condemned as racist. Horton, who was black, raped a woman while out of prison on a weekend furlough. As Massachusetts governor, Dukakis supported the furlough program. Dukakis went on to lose to Republican George H.W. Bush.
The video tweeted by Trump did not immediately appear to be running on television, although it received extensive coverage on cable news networks. As of Thursday morning, it had received 2.65 million views in less than 24 hours and was the “pinned” tweet atop Trump’s profile, meaning it is the first thing any visitor to his Twitter page would see. Bracamontes was also featured in a January ad from the Trump campaign that received less attention.
The White House and the Trump campaign did not immediately respond to requests for comments as to who made or paid for the video or if any tax dollars were used to run it from the president’s account. It stood in stark contrast to an ad circulated by the Trump campaign earlier in the week that highlighted rosy economic numbers and depicted gauzy scenes of American suburban life.
Tom Perez, chairman of the Democratic National Committee, called the new ad the “dog whistle of all dog whistles.”
“This is distracting, divisive Donald at his worst,” Perez said on CNN. “This is fearmongering.”
Al Cardenas, former head of the American Conservative Union, tweeted at Trump: “You are a despicable divider; the worse social poison to afflict our country in decades. This ad, and your full approval of it, will condemn you and your bigoted legacy forever in the annals of America’s history books.”

“This is an invasion,” Trump declared as he has previously on a subject that has been shown to resonate strongly with his base of Republican supporters. He made his comments at the White House in a speech that was billed as a response to groups of migrants currently walking toward the U.S. border.
He then left for an evening political rally in Missouri, the latest in a daily series he has scheduled leading up to next Tuesday’s elections for control of Congress.
U.S. immigration laws make clear that migrants seeking asylum may do so either at or between border crossings. But Trump said he would limit that to official crossing points. The U.S. also doesn’t have space at the border to manage the large-scale detention of migrants, with most facilities at capacity. But Trump said the government would erect “massive tents.”
“We’re stopping people at the border,” he said firmly.
His announcement marked Trump’s latest attempt to keep the issue of immigration front-and-center in the final stretch before next Tuesday’s elections. Notably, he said his executive order would come next week, which means it could be after Election Day.
Trump also said that he had told the U.S. military mobilizing at the southwest border that if U.S. troops face rock-throwing migrants, they should react as though the rocks were “rifles.”

The exact rules for the use of force by military police and other soldiers who will be operating near the border have not been disclosed, but in all cases troops have the right of self-defense. At any rate, they are not expected to be in positions where anyone trying to storm across the border would quickly come in contact with them.
Mark Hertling, a retired Army general, wrote on Twitter after Trump’s speech that no military officer would allow a soldier to shoot an individual throwing a rock. “It would be an unlawful order,” he wrote, citing the Law of Land Warfare.
The president announced on Wednesday that he was considering deploying up to 15,000 troops to the U.S.-Mexican border in response to the still far-off caravans — roughly double the number the Pentagon said it currently plans for a mission whose dimensions are shifting daily.
Trump said Thursday that, under his order, any migrants who do manage to enter the country illegally will be housed in “massive tent cities” he plans to build while their cases are processed.
“We’re not releasing them into our country anymore,” he said. “We have thousands of tents.”
Under current protocol, many asylum seekers are released while their cases make their way through back-logged courts — a process that can take years.
Trump and other administration officials have long demanded that those seeking asylum come through legal ports of entry. But many migrants are unaware of that guidance, and official border crossings have grown increasingly clogged. Immigration officials have turned away asylum-seekers at ports of entry because of overcrowding, telling them to return at a later date. Backlogs have grown especially bad in recent months at crossings in California, Arizona and Texas, with people generally waiting five weeks to try to claim asylum at San Diego’s main crossing and sleeping out in the open for days at a time.
The administration has also been ramping up security at ports of entry this week. In McAllen, Texas, in the Rio Grande Valley, workers were seen installing additional gates and fences along a walkway on a bridge between the U.S. and Mexico, according to The Monitor newspaper of McAllen.
Migrants who cross illegally are generally arrested and often seek asylum or some other form of protection. Claims have spiked in recent years, and there is currently a backlog of more than 800,000 cases pending in immigration court. Administration officials have railed against what they say are loopholes designed to encourage people, especially from Central America, to come to the U.S. and claim asylum. Generally, only about 20 percent of applicants are approved.

The U.S. fielded more than 330,000 asylum claims in 2017, nearly double the number two years earlier and surpassing Germany as highest in the world.
There are currently four caravans making their way toward the U.S. The main group of about 4,000 migrants — down from its estimated peak of more than 7,000 — remains in southern Mexico, mostly on foot and hundreds of miles from the border. A second, smaller group of 1,000 or so is more than 200 miles behind the first. A third band of about 500 from El Salvador has made it to Guatemala, and a fourth group of about 700 set out from the Salvadoran capital Wednesday.
Trump has nonetheless mounted an enormous show of force in response.
The first 100 active duty troops arrived at the border in McAllen on Thursday — part of the “more than 7,000” troops the Pentagon said were being sent to support Customs and Border Protection agents.
But troop estimates have been changing at a dizzying pace. Just last week officials were indicating that about 800 to 1,000 might be sent. On Monday, officials announced that about 5,200 were being deployed. The next day, the Air Force general running the operation said more than the initially announced total were going, but he pointedly rejected a news report that it could reach 14,000, saying that was “not consistent with what’s actually being planned.”
Just 24 hours later, Trump caught the Pentagon by surprise.
“We have about 5,800. We’ll go up to anywhere between 10,000 and 15,000 military personnel on top of Border Patrol, ICE and everybody else at the border,” he said Wednesday.
Trump has rejected the idea he has been “fearmongering” and using the issue for political purposes, but his escalating rhetoric in the final days of the campaign calls that denial into question. He also has said he plans an executive order to unilaterally end the constitutionally protected right of citizenship for children born to non-U.S. citizens.
Trump also tweeted a video Wednesday alleging Democrats were responsible for allowing a homicidal immigrant into the U.S. but provided no evidence supporting that claim.
The video includes scenes of migrants moving toward the U.S. and asks ominously, “Who else would Democrats let in?”
It was reminiscent of the infamous “Willie Horton” ad used against Democratic presidential candidate Michael Dukakis in 1988 and condemned as racist. Horton, who was black, raped a woman while out of prison on a weekend furlough. As Massachusetts governor, Dukakis supported the furlough program. He lost to Republican George H.W. Bush.

Trump told reporters at the White House on Wednesday that “we’ll go up to anywhere between 10 and 15,000 military personnel on top of Border Patrol, ICE and everybody else at the border.”
He says the move would be aimed at preventing the entry of a caravan of migrants traveling from Central America. The caravan is still nearly 1,000 miles (1,600 kilometers) from the border.
Trump says that the U.S. was “going to be prepared” and that the migrants are “not coming into our country.”
Currently there are 2,100 National Guard helping at the border. The Pentagon says an additional 5,200 active-duty troops could join them.
Earlier in the day, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis pushed back on suggestions that the move to send thousands of active-duty troops to the Southwest border is a political stunt ahead of the midterm elections next week.
Mattis told reporters Wednesday at the Pentagon that the deployment of more than 5,200 troops is based on a request from the Department of Homeland Security. He says, “We don’t do stunts in this department.”
An estimated 4,000 Central American migrants in a caravan have been walking across Mexico toward the U.S. border. Mattis authorized the deployment of the active-duty troops, and 2,000 to 3,000 additional forces have been told to prepare to deploy if needed.
The forces are largely providing airlift transportation, tents, barriers and other logistical support for the Border Patrol.

Tent cities for asylum seekers. An end to the Constitution’s guarantee of birthright citizenship.
With his eyes squarely on next Tuesday’s elections, President Donald Trump is rushing out hardline immigration declarations, promises and actions as he tries to mobilize supporters to retain Republican control of Congress. His own campaign in 2016 concentrated on border fears, and that’s his final-week focus in the midterm fight.
“This has nothing to do with elections,” the president insists. But his timing is striking.
Trump says he will send more than 5,000 military troops to the Mexican border to help defend against caravans of Central American migrants who are on foot and still hundreds of miles away. Tent cities would not resolve the massive U.S. backlog of asylum seekers. And most legal scholars say it would take a new constitutional amendment to alter the current one granting citizenship to anyone born in America.
Still, Trump plunges ahead with daily alarms and proclamations about immigration in tweets, interviews and policy announcements in the days leading up to elections that Democrats hope will give them at least partial control of Congress.
Trump and many top aides have long seen the immigration issue as the most effective rallying cry for his base of supporters. The president had been expected to make an announcement about new actions at the border on Tuesday, but that was scrapped so he could travel instead to Pittsburgh, where 11 people were massacred in a synagogue during Sabbath services.
Between the shootings, the deadliest attack on Jews in U.S. history, and the mail bomb scare targeting Democrats and a media organization, the caravan of migrants slowly trudging north had faded from front pages and cable TV.
But with well-timed interviews on Fox and “Axios on HBO,” Trump revived some of his hardest-line immigration ideas:
The administration on Monday also announced plans to deploy 5,200 active duty troops — more than double the 2,000 who are in Syria fighting the Islamic State group — to the border to help stave off the caravans.
The main caravan, still in southern Mexico, was continuing to melt away — from the original 7,000 to about 4,000 — as a smaller group apparently hoped to join it.

Trump insists his immigration moves have nothing to do with politics, even as he rails against the caravans at campaign rallies.
“I’ve been saying this long before the election. I’ve been saying this before I ever thought of running for office. We have to have strong borders,” Trump told Fox News host Laura Ingraham in an interview Monday.
Critics weren’t buying it.
“They’re playing all of us,” said David W. Leopold, an immigration attorney and counsel to the immigration advocacy group America’s Voice. “This is not about locking people up. This is not about birthright citizenship. This is about winning an election next week.”
Trump’s citizenship proposal would inevitably spark a long-shot legal battle over whether the president can alter the long-accepted understanding that the 14th Amendment grants citizenship to any child born on U.S. soil, regardless of his parents’ immigration status.
Omar Jadwat, director of the Immigrants’ Rights Project at the American Civil Liberties Union in New York, said the Constitution is very clear.
“If you are born in the United States, you’re a citizen,” he said. He called it “outrageous that the president can think he can override constitutional guarantees by issuing an executive order.
A week before the midterms, President Trump is trying to keep immigration issues front and center. Nick Schifrin reports.
James Ho, a conservative Trump-appointed federal appeals court judge, wrote in 2006, before his appointment, that birthright citizenship “is protected no less for children of undocumented persons than for descendants of Mayflower passengers.”
Even House Speaker Paul Ryan, typically a supporter of Trump proposals, said on WVLK radio in Kentucky: “Well you obviously cannot do that. You cannot end birthright citizenship with an executive order.”
But Trump says his lawyers have assured him that the change could be made with “just with an executive order” — an argument he has been making since his early days as a candidate, when he dubbed birthright citizenship a “magnet for illegal immigration” and pledged to end it.
“We’re the only country in the world where a person comes in and has a baby, and the baby is essentially a citizen of the United States,” he said in an Axios interview excerpt released Tuesday.
Not so, according to a 2010 study from the Center for Immigration Studies, a group that supports immigration restrictions, which said at least 30 countries offer birthright citizenship.
Vice President Mike Pence said the administration was “looking at action that would reconsider birthright citizenship.”
“We all know what the 14th Amendment says. We all cherish the language of the 14th Amendment. But the Supreme Court of the United States has never ruled on whether or not — whether the language of the 14th Amendment, ‘subject to the jurisdiction thereof,’ applies specifically to the people who are in the country illegally,” he said at a Politico event.
The nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute estimates that more than 4 million U.S.-born children under the age of 18 have an unauthorized immigrant parent.
A person familiar with the internal White House debate said the topic of birthright citizenship has come up inside the West Wing at various times — and not without some detractors. However, White House lawyers expect to work with the Justice Department to develop a legal justification for the action. The person was not authorized to discuss the policy debate so spoke on condition of anonymity.
In Trump’s Monday interview with Fox, he said the U.S. also plans to build tent cities to house migrants seeking asylum, who would be detained until their cases were completed. Right now, some asylum seekers, particularly families, are being released as their cases progress because there isn’t enough detention space to house them.
“We’re going to put tents up all over the place,” Trump said. “They’re going to be very nice, and they’re going to wait, and if they don’t get asylum they get out.”
The country is facing a massive backlog of immigration cases — some 700,000 — and there are more and more families coming across the border from Central America — groups who cannot be simply returned over the border. But experts question the legality and practicality of what would amount to indefinite detention.
The options are just two of many possibilities currently under discussion, including asylum law changes and simply barring members of the migrant caravans from entering the country using the same mechanism as the president’s much-publicized travel ban for people from certain Muslim countries.
Administration officials say decisions are unlikely until after the midterm elections, in part because of the synagogue shooting and pipe-bomb scare.
But some supporters in Congress are rushing to cheer Trump on.
GOP Rep. Steve King of Iowa, who has introduced legislation to end birthright citizenship, said Trump was deftly seizing on an issue that was sure to help in the midterms.
“That ability to move on instinct without hesitation, that’s why he’s president,” King said.

Trump made the comments to “Axios on HBO” ahead of elections that he has sought to focus on his hardline immigration policies. Trump, seeking to energize his supporters and help Republicans keep control of Congress, has stoked anxiety about a caravan of Central American migrants making its way to the U.S.-Mexico border. He is dispatching additional troops and saying he’ll set up tent cities for asylum seekers.
Revoking birthright citizenship would spark a court fight over whether the president has the unilateral ability to change an amendment to the Constitution. The 14th Amendment guarantees that right for all children born in the U.S.
Asked about the legality of such an executive order, Trump said, “they’re saying I can do it just with an executive order.” He added that “we’re the only country in the world where a person comes in and has a baby, and the baby is essentially a citizen of the United States.”
An excerpt of the interview was posted on Axios’ website on Tuesday.
The president said White House lawyers are reviewing his proposal. It’s unclear how quickly he would act on an executive order. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for additional comment.
Some experts questioned whether Trump could follow through.
Omar Jadwat, director of the Immigrants’ Rights Project at the American Civil Liberties Union in New York, said Tuesday said the Constitution is very clear.
“If you are born in the United States, you’re a citizen,” he said, adding that it was “outrageous that the president can think he can override constitutional guarantees by issuing an executive order,
Jadwat said the president has an obligation to uphold the Constitution. Trump can try to get Congress to pass a constitutional amendment, “but I don’t think they are anywhere close to getting that.”
“Obviously, even if he did, it would be subject to court challenge,” he added.
In the final days before the Nov. 6 midterms, Trump has emphasized immigration, as he seeks to counter Democratic enthusiasm. Trump believes that his campaign pledges, including his much-vaunted and still-unfulfilled promise to quickly build a U.S.-Mexico border wall, are still rallying cries for his base and that this latest focus will further erode the enthusiasm gap.
Trump voiced his theory that birthright citizenship could be stripped during his campaign, when he described it as a “magnet for illegal immigration.” During a 2015 campaign stop in Florida, he said: “The birthright citizenship – the anchor baby – birthright citizenship, it’s over, not going to happen.”
The first line of the 14th Amendment states: “All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the state wherein they reside.”
The 14th Amendment was passed by Congress in 1866 during the period of Reconstruction after the Civil War. It was ratified in 1868 by three-fourths of the states. By extending citizenship to those born in the U.S., the amendment nullified an 1857 Supreme Court decision (Dred Scott v. Sandford), which ruled that those descended from slaves could not be citizens.

The number of troops being deployed is more than double the 2,000 who are in Syria fighting the Islamic State group.
Trump, eager to keep voters focused on illegal immigration in the lead-up to the elections, stepped up his dire warnings about the caravans, tweeting, “This is an invasion of our Country and our Military is waiting for you!”
But any migrants who complete the long trek to the southern U.S. border already face major hurdles — both physical and bureaucratic — to being allowed into the United States.
The Pentagon’s “Operation Faithful Patriot” was described by the commander of U.S. Northern Command as an effort to help Customs and Border Protection “harden the southern border” by stiffening defenses at and near legal entry points. Advanced helicopters will allow border protection agents to swoop down on migrants trying to cross illegally, said Air Force Gen. Terrence O’Shaughnessy.
Troops planned to bring heavy concertina wiring to unspool across open spaces between ports.
“We will not allow a large group to enter the U.S. in an unlawful and unsafe manner,” said Kevin McAleenan, commissioner of Customs and Border Protection.
Eight hundred troops already are on their way to southern Texas, O’Shaughnessy said, and their numbers will top 5,200 by week’s end. Some of the troops will be armed. He said troops would focus first on Texas, followed by Arizona and then California.
The troops will join the more than 2,000 National Guardsmen that Trump has already deployed to the border. It remained unclear Monday why the administration was choosing to send active-duty troops given that they will be limited to performing the same support functions the Guard already is doing.
The number of people in the first migrant caravan headed toward the U.S. has dwindled to about 4,000 from about 7,000 last week, though a second one was gaining steam and marked by violence. About 600 migrants in the second group tried to cross a bridge from Guatemala to Mexico en masse Monday. The riverbank standoff with Mexico police followed a more violent confrontation Sunday when the migrants used sticks and rocks against officers. One migrant was killed Sunday night by a head wound, but the cause was unclear.
The first group passed through the spot via the river — wading or on rafts — and was advancing through southern Mexico. That group appeared to begin as a collection of about 160 who decided to band together in Honduras for protection against the gangs who prey on migrants traveling alone and snowballed as the group moved north. They are mostly from Honduras, where it started, as well as El Salvador and Guatemala.
Another, smaller caravan earlier this year dwindled greatly as it passed through Mexico, with only about 200 making it to the California border.
Migrants are entitled under both U.S. and international law to apply for asylum. But there already is a bottleneck of would-be asylum seekers waiting at some U.S. border crossings to make their claims, some waiting as long as five weeks.
McAleenan said the aim of the operation was to deter migrants from crossing illegally, but he conceded his officers were overwhelmed by a surge of asylum seekers at border crossings. He also said Mexico was prepared to offer asylum to members of the caravan.
“If you’re already seeking asylum, you’ve been given a generous offer,” he said of Mexico. “We want to work with Mexico to manage that flow.”
The White House is also weighing additional border security measures, including blocking those traveling in the caravan from seeking legal asylum and preventing them from entering the U.S.
The military operation drew quick criticism.
“Sending active military forces to our southern border is not only a huge waste of taxpayer money, but an unnecessary course of action that will further terrorize and militarize our border communities,” said Shaw Drake of the American Civil Liberties Union’s border rights center at El Paso, Texas.
Military personnel are legally prohibited from engaging in immigration enforcement. The troops will include military police, combat engineers and others helping on the border.
The escalating rhetoric over the migrants and expected deployments come as the president has been trying to turn the caravans into a key election issue just days before elections that will determine whether Republicans maintain control of Congress.
“This will be the election of the caravans, the Kavanaughs, law and order, tax cuts, and you know what else? It’s going to be the election of common sense,” Trump said at a rally in Illinois on Saturday night.
On Monday, he tweeted without providing evidence, “Many Gang Members and some very bad people are mixed into the Caravan heading to our Southern Border.”
“Please go back,” he urged them, “you will not be admitted into the United States unless you go through the legal process. This is an invasion of our Country and our Military is waiting for you!”
It’s possible there are criminals mixed in, but Trump has not substantiated his claim that members of the MS-13 gang, in particular, are among them.
The troops are expected to perform a wide variety of functions such as transporting supplies for the Border Patrol, but not engage directly with migrants seeking to cross the border, officials said. One U.S. official said the troops will be sent initially to staging bases in California, Texas and Arizona while the CBP works out precisely where it wants the troops positioned. U.S. Transportation Command posted a video on its Facebook page Monday of a C-17 transport plane that it said was delivering Army equipment to the Southwest border in support of the operation.
The U.S. military has already begun delivering jersey barriers to the southern border in conjunction with the deployment plans.

https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/wait-times-for-citizenship-applications-stretch-to-2-years,migrant,902,2018-10-28T17:04:20-04:00,"Amy Taxin, Associated Press",Wait times for citizenship applications stretch to 2 years,"LOS ANGELES — More than 700,000 immigrants are waiting on applications to become U.S. citizens, a process that once typically took about six months but has stretched to more than two years in some places under the administration of President Donald Trump.
The long wait times have prompted some immigrant advocates to ask whether the delays are aimed at keeping anti-Trump voters from casting ballots in elections.
“People are motivated to participate, and they’re being frustrated from being able to participate in the elections they’re excited about,” said Manuel Pastor, director of the University of Southern California’s Center for the Study of Immigrant Integration.
The number of immigrants aspiring to become U.S. citizens surged during 2016, jumping 27 percent from a year earlier as Trump made cracking down on immigration a central theme of his presidential campaign. At first, the federal government kept up with the applications, but then the wait grew.
Backlogs are nothing new in the U.S. immigration system. It often takes years to receive asylum or to be deported. But naturalization — the final step to become an American citizen, obtain a U.S. passport and receive voting rights — had not been subject to such delays in recent years.
Now the average wait time for officials to decide on applications is more than 10 months. It takes up to 22 months in Atlanta and as long as 26 months in parts of Texas, according to official estimates.
Trump tweeted on Thursday that Central American migrants headed north in a U.S.-bound caravan should return home and can apply for American citizenship if they wish. “Go back to your Country and if you want, apply for citizenship like millions of others are doing!” he posted as thousands continued their trek through Mexico.
But immigrants generally must be legal permanent residents of the United States to apply for citizenship and getting a green card can take years — if a person even qualifies for one.
U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services said the longer waits to naturalize are because of the surge in applications, not slower processing. The agency decided 850,000 cases in 2017, up 8 percent from a year before.
Despite “a record and unprecedented” spike in applications, the agency is operating more efficiently and effectively and “outperforming itself,” spokesman Michael Bars said in a statement.
To become an American citizen, immigrants must hold green cards for at least three years, demonstrate good moral character and pass English and civics tests.
Citizenship applications typically rise before an increase in filing fees and during presidential election years as immigrants get excited about the prospect of voting and advocacy groups conduct widespread outreach to try to get more eligible voters to the polls.
Enrique Robles, 32, said he applied to naturalize as soon as he was eligible after living in the U.S. most of his life. When he didn’t hear about the status of his application, Robles, who is originally from Mexico, started to worry.
More than a year later, he said, he was called to an interview where an immigration officer questioned whether he should have been issued a green card in the first place, a concern he was able to quickly dispel by explaining that his father had legitimately sponsored him.
“With this administration, it feels like more they are looking for possibilities to kick people out,” said Robles, who took his citizenship oath in September.
Keeping potential citizens from voting could have an effect, but it could also drive their relatives and friends to the polls in greater numbers.
“The naturalization delays have a huge cost in stopping some people” from voting, but they “have a huge impact in motivating others,” said Jeremy Robbins, executive director of New American Economy, a bipartisan group in support of immigration.
Competitive districts that have a large number of foreign-born residents are likely to be among those where naturalization delays could matter most. Those include districts in California’s Orange County and in Texas and New Jersey, Robbins said.
At a recent naturalization ceremony in Los Angeles, some new citizens said the process seemed long to them, while others said it flew by in a matter of months. Key for many was being able to travel with an American passport and being able to vote.
Sameeha Alkamalee Jabbar, 38, who is from Sri Lanka, said the process took 10 months and at times she worried about the backlog. She wants to vote next month because “every vote counts” — and especially because her husband is seeking re-election to a school board seat in Orange County.
“This is home now,” she said, wearing a stars-and-stripes hijab. “I love the United States of America.”
Immigrant advocates recently filed a lawsuit in Los Angeles demanding records from the Trump administration on the delays. They questioned whether wait times were longer in electoral battleground states and said that could suggest voter suppression.
Juliana Cabrales, Mid-Atlantic director of civic engagement at the NALEO Educational Fund, which supports Latino participation in politics, said the group is focused on driving voter turnout in the midterm elections but will quickly pivot to encouraging immigrants to apply for citizenship if they want to vote for president in 2020.
“Right now, we’re finding ourselves in this space, in places like Miami and New York, where processing times are 21 months,” she said. “If you want to vote in 2020 you have to apply (to naturalize) now.”"
https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/enough-is-enough-fed-up-americans-crave-unity-amid-violence,migrant,1312,2018-10-28T12:29:33-04:00,"Claire Galofaro, Associated Press",Enough is enough: Fed-up Americans crave unity amid violence,"LOUISVILLE, Ky. — She flipped through television channels and radio stations, scanning from conservative to liberal media, searching for any sign that the polarized nation had finally reached its tipping point.
For days, Elisa Karem Parker had been seeing updates in the news: A pipe bomb sent to liberal political donor George Soros. One delivered to CNN. More to former President Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton and other prominent political figures villainized by those on the right — a bizarre plot unfolding just ahead of the midterm election that will decide which party controls Congress.
“It’s like our country is becoming ‘The Hunger Games,’” Parker, who considers herself squarely in the middle of the political divide, told her husband and teenage son over dinner.
As authorities intercepted more than a dozen pipe bombs addressed to President Donald Trump’s most ardent critics, political scientists and ordinary Americans observed, again, that rabid partisanship had devolved to the point of acts of violent extremism. Many wonder whether this latest spasm might be the moment that the nation collectively considers how poisonous the political culture has become and decides to turn the other way.
“If this isn’t it, I’d hate to think about what it will take,” said Parker as she cast her ballot in early voting last week in Louisville, Kentucky.

The mail-bomb plot is merely the latest in a series of stunning attacks to test how much political animosity Americans are willing to accept: the shooting of a Republican congressman at a baseball practice , the white supremacist rally that turned deadly in Virginia, the recent ricin scare-letters mailed to Trump and other top members of his administration.
On Friday, authorities arrested a suspect in the bomb probe — a 56-year-old registered Republican and Trump enthusiast who “appears to be a partisan,” Attorney General Jeff Sessions said when asked about motive. By then, politicians and talking heads had already backed into the usual corners: Both parties blamed the other, and the president called for unity, then again described liberals and the media as villains. The hope Parker had that this might be a turning point faded.
And then, on Saturday, news broke of a mass shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue, an attack likely to cause ugly partisan debates over gun control, hate speech and more.
The volatile tribalism now so ingrained in American life will eventually right itself, says Robb Willer, a sociology professor at Stanford University, but not until the public decides it’s had enough and stops rewarding politicians who use incendiary language and demonize the other side. It’s impossible to guess, he notes, how much damage will be done in the meantime.
“That is the question of our time: Are we going to choose to continue the war, or are we going to choose peace? And we don’t know yet what the answer to that will be, because while a majority of Americans are fed up with the extremity of our political divisions, it does feel like we’re stuck here,” Willer says. “It will get worse before it gets better.”
Animosity between parties has been growing for decades now, to the point that studies show Republicans and Democrats don’t want to date one another, don’t want their children to marry one another and don’t want to live in the same neighborhoods at a rate unprecedented in modern America. At the same time, politicians began using increasingly apocalyptic language. Willer says those two forces — the splintering of society along party lines and the ascent of vitriolic campaigning — merged to create a breeding ground for violence.
“It was simmering,” says Parker. “It’s like the gas burner was on, then Trump lit the fire.”
The president vaulted to political prominence by promoting the racist and false conspiracy theory that Obama was not born in the United States, launched his presidential campaign by calling Mexicans rapists and murderers, and routinely describes his enemies, including the intended recipients of the pipe bombs, as “evil,” ″dangerous,” ″the enemy of the American people.”
“That let loose a period of incivility, which is too mild a word; it’s potentially explosive anger that can turn into violence,” says Bob Shrum, a former Democratic strategist who last month started the Center for the Political Future, a program at the University of Southern California designed to restore sanity and bipartisanship in politics.
He’s watched with frustration as some liberal politicians respond to Trump’s presidency by imitating his divisive style. He describes it as a “cold civil war,” where people consider those who disagree with them bad, un-American — their enemy.
“Is there a tipping point? I don’t know,” he says. “I do believe we’re in a dangerous moment, unlike anything I’ve seen in my lifetime, and I’m 75 years old.”
There is little evidence the tide will turn soon.
Moderates are becoming increasingly rare in Washington, D.C., and Republicans willing to criticize Trump’s rhetoric, such as Sen. Jeff Flake of Arizona and Sen. Bob Corker of Tennessee, are not running for re-election.
“You don’t really have those reasonable voices kind of trying to bring everybody together,” says Tom Freeman, a Republican attorney in Lincoln, Nebraska. “It’s just kind of round and round we go, and the sides just get more and more extreme, and you don’t have that rational leader in the crowd saying, ‘Hey, let’s dial it back.’ The sad thing is, if you did have that person, I don’t know that anyone would listen to them.”
The polarization is bleeding into everyday Americans’ personal lives.
Robert Major, a 51-year-old electrician and Republican from Fort Lauderdale, Florida, says he once moved because his landlord, a liberal, screamed at him for watching conservative news channels.
Meeka Grayer, a 38-year-old radio talk show host and Democrat from Omaha, Nebraska, lost friends over the divide. One conservative friend posted on Facebook about the migrant caravan heading toward the United States from Central America, parroting the president’s vilification of the group. Grayer objected and was attacked for her comments, prompting her to block her friend.
Though on opposite sides politically, Grayer and Major agree: The political climate is toxic and tiresome, but they have little confidence it will change because it’s too useful to politicians who want to stay in power.
“I think it’s time for the little guy to take control, but will that happen?” says Randy Wick, a 68-year-old Republican in Bloomingdale, Illinois, who blames Republicans, Democrats and the media for the division. “It seems like a good ol’ boys club up there in Washington. It’s all about money.”
Willer, the Stanford sociologist, says the absence of political leaders brave enough to try to steer the country onto a better path means it will be left up to voters to break the cycle. Until then, the divisions will only get deeper.
Some already casting votes for the Nov. 6 midterm election say they hope the system can self-correct. The future of the nation, the very concept of democracy, is at stake.
“America is resilient; we find a way even in our darkest days,” 36-year-old Cordell Lawrence said as he voted last week in Louisville. Lawrence described himself only as a moderate, preferring not to make public what party he leans to because he worries that could hinder personal and professional relationships.
“Maybe we have to hit rock bottom before we find how to get back up,” he said. “We’re probably pretty close to rock bottom today. At least I hope we are.”

https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/trump-plans-to-send-troops-to-border-as-response-to-caravan,migrant,953,2018-10-26T08:24:47-04:00,"Robert Burns, Associated Press",Mattis approves request for military help at southern border,"WASHINGTON — The Pentagon on Friday approved a request for additional troops at the southern border, likely to total several hundred to help the U.S. Border Patrol as President Donald Trump seeks to transform fears about immigration and a caravan of Central American migrants into electoral gains in the midterms.
Defense Secretary Jim Mattis signed off on a request for help from the Department of Homeland Security and authorized the military staff to work out details such as the size, composition and estimated cost of the deployments, according to a U.S. official.
Mattis, who is traveling in the Middle East, is expected to approve the actual deployments after all the details are ironed out, according to the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss planning that has not yet been completed or publicly announced.
The action comes as Trump has spent recent days calling attention to the caravan of Central Americans slowly making their way by foot into southern Mexico, but still more than 1,000 miles from U.S. soil.
Trump, who made fear about immigrants a major theme of his 2016 election campaign, has been eager to make it a top issue heading into the Nov. 6 midterm elections, which will determine control of Congress. The president and senior White House officials have long believed the issue is key to turning out his supporters.
The additional troops, possibly numbering 800 or more, would provide logistical and other support to the Border Patrol, said the official. This likely would include military engineers, aviators and perhaps military police to assist with security. No combat forces are to be deployed, but because some troops may be armed for self-defense, Pentagon lawyers were working out rules governing the use of force before final deployment decisions are made, the official said.
It’s not unusual for the National Guard to help with border security. Although active duty troops are sometimes called on for domestic emergencies like hurricanes or floods, they rarely deploy to the southern border. Fears of militarizing the border were fanned by a May 1997 incident in which a Marine on a counter-narcotics mission shot to death an 18-year-old who was herding goats in Redford, Texas.
In the current situation, active duty troops will not be on armed security missions.
The additional members of the military would assist the Border Patrol by providing things such as vehicles, tents and equipment. There already are about 2,000 National Guard troops there under a previous Pentagon arrangement.
Trump has used the caravan to bolster his election-season warnings that the U.S. is being infiltrated by illegal immigrants “pouring across the border,” whom he has painted with a sinister brush.
He has claimed without any apparent basis in fact that “Middle Easterners” were among the shirking group. At rallies and on Twitter, Trump has tried to portray the Democrats as pro-illegal immigration, even claiming, with no evidence, that Democrats had organized and paid for the caravan.
He tweeted Thursday that, “Democrat inspired laws make it tough for us to stop people at the border” and said he was using the military to respond to what he called a “National Emergency.”
The migrants in the sprawling caravan — once estimated by the United Nations to number more than 7,000 — are hoping to make it to the United States. Most are Hondurans, seeking to escape the poverty and violence that plagues the region.
The caravan swelled dramatically soon after crossing the Mexican border on Oct. 19, but sickness, fear and police harassment have whittled down its numbers. Since entering Mexico at its southernmost tip, the group has advanced roughly 95 miles.
Trump tweeted a direct message to the migrants Thursday, urging them to return home.
“To those in the Caravan, turnaround,” he wrote. “We are not letting people into the United States illegally. Go back to your Country and if you want, apply for citizenship like millions of others are doing!”
The migrants have largely been disconnected from news reports about them while on the road. When asked about Trump’s tweets critical of the caravan and his vows to keep them out, they have generally responded that he should stop attacking them and said they would keep trying to reach the United States.
Trump earlier this year ordered the deployment of National Guard members to the U.S.-Mexico border to respond to a spike in illegal border crossings. But those members remain under the control of the governors of the states where they’re positioned, and their activities are limited to supportive roles, such as providing surveillance.
The addition of 800 or more active duty troops, if approved, as expected, by Mattis, is in response to a request from the Department of Homeland Security, which manages the Border Patrol, a U.S. official said.
DHS asked for help in various forms. It was not immediately clear why active duty forces were chosen, since National Guard troops can perform the same functions. Earlier this year Mattis authorized Pentagon funding for up to 4,000 National Guard troops on the border and thus far only a little over 2,000 have been used.
Federal law prohibits the use of active duty service members for law enforcement inside the U.S. unless specifically authorized by Congress.
Trump had tweeted Monday that he’d alerted Border Patrol and the military that the caravan was “a National Emergy,” but the Pentagon said then that they’d received no new orders to provide troops for border security.
But Trump told a rally crowd in Wisconsin on Wednesday that moves were underway.
“Wait’ll you see what happens over the next couple of weeks. You’re going to see a very secure border. You just watch,” he told the crowd. “And the military is ready. They’re all set.”"

Mattis is responding to a request from President Donald Trump, who says he’s “bringing out the military” to address what he’s calling a national emergency at the border. Thousands of Central American migrants are now making their way through Mexico in hopes of reaching the United States.
The U.S. official was not authorized to speak publicly because not all details of the military arrangement had been worked out, and so spoke on condition of anonymity.
The additional troops are to provide what one official described as logistical support to the Border Patrol. This would include a variety of things such as vehicles, tents and equipment, and perhaps medical support. It was not immediately clear how many, if any, of the extra troops would be armed. Because they would not be performing law enforcement duties they would not be in violation of the Posse Comitatus Act, which prohibits the federal government from using the armed forces in a domestic police role.
There already are about 2,000 National Guard troops assisting at the border under a previous Pentagon arrangement.
Trump announced that he’s “bringing out the military” in a tweet Thursday morning, blaming Democrats for laws he said make it too hard to stop people at the border. He said those trying to enter the U.S. “will be stopped!”
Trump tweeted Monday that he’d alerted the military that the situation was a “National Emergy” — but the Pentagon said then that it had received no new orders to provide troops for border security.
Trump told a rally crowd in Wisconsin on Wednesday that the military was “all set.”
The president’s tweets reflect an effort to thrust immigration politics into the national conversation in the closing weeks of the congressional election campaign. He and his senior aides have long believed the issue — which was a centerpiece of his winning presidential campaign — is key to revving up his base and motivating GOP voters to turn out in November."

Trump himself acknowledged he’s got no proof terrorists are in the mix.
A look at their remarks:
PENCE: “In the last fiscal year, we apprehended more than 10 terrorists or suspected terrorists per day at our southern border from countries that are referred to in the lexicon as other than Mexico. That means from the Middle East region.” — remarks at a Washington Post event.
THE FACTS: He misused information from the government.
U.S. Customs and Border Protection arrested an average of 10 people a day in the 2017 budget year who were trying to enter the U.S. from countries with suspected links to terrorism, according to Pence’s office. That average applies to all points of entry, not just the southern border. And the primary points of entry for people coming from overseas are airports, not the two borders.
Pence’s office acknowledged his mistake. Pence cited the information accurately later, at an Oval Office bill signing by Trump.

TRUMP: “I spoke with Border Patrol this morning. … They say that over the course of the year, over the course of many years, they have intercepted good and bad people, including people from the Middle East. There’s no proof of anything.” — remarks at Oval Office bill signing.
THE FACTS: He is correct that no information has been made public to support his previous claim that Middle Easterners, apparent code for Islamic extremists, have infiltrated the migrant caravan to reach the U.S. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders had claimed there was evidence to back up his tweet.
The migrants participating in this caravan are mostly from Honduras, where it started, as well as El Salvador and Guatemala. On the whole they are poor, carrying the belongings that fit into a knapsack and fleeing gang violence or poverty. Given the sheer number of migrants, it’s possible some are criminals — as Trump has also asserted.
Some migrants clashed with Mexican police at the Mexico-Guatemala border, hurling stones and other objects as they tried to cross the international bridge. Caravan leaders said they had expelled some troublemakers from the procession, exhibiting some self-policing. Ultimately, most entered Guatemala — and later, Mexico — by illegally bypassing immigration checkpoints.
The caravan otherwise has been overwhelmingly peaceful, receiving applause and donated food from residents of the towns they pass. Mexican police have not tried again to stop them.
Guatemalan officials say they detained several Syrian citizens with false documents two years ago and deported them. No evidence was made public connecting them to the Islamic State group.
Trump now says: “There’s no proof of anything. But there could very well be.”

Federal investigators were reviewing surveillance video to determine whether the package had been sent through the mail or delivered some other way, officials said, adding it was also not clear if the parcel was addressed to Soros.
A security officer at the compound about 50 miles (80 kilometers) north of Manhattan became suspicious of the package Monday afternoon and placed it in a wooded area before alerting the FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, authorities said. Agents came out and safely detonated the device, which a federal law enforcement official said contained explosive powder.
“It was not a hoax device,” said the official, who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the investigation.
Another federal official who also spoke on condition of anonymity said the device resembled a pipe bomb and was inside a package placed in a mailbox outside the gates of the compound. It was opened in a secure location just inside the gates, nowhere near Soros’ quarters, the official said.
The Bedford Police Department said the FBI’s terrorism task force was investigating.
The FBI’s New York field office said on Twitter that there was “no threat to public safety” but did not respond to messages seeking comment.
We are conducting an investigation at and around a residence in Bedford, NY. There is no threat to public safety, and we have no further comment at this time.

A message emailed to Soros’ foundation wasn’t immediately returned.
Soros, who made his fortune in hedge funds, frequently donates to liberal causes. Recently, conservative critics have accused him without evidence of secretly financing the caravan of Central American migrants making their way toward the U.S.
Soros, who is Jewish, has also been the target of anti-Semitic smears. Some have falsely accused him of being a Nazi collaborator during World War II, when he was a child in Hungary.
Activists frequently post on social media the addresses of his homes, sometimes along with threats.

Trump said Monday he’s not satisfied with the explanations he’s heard about the Washington Post columnist and critic of the kingdom who died Oct. 2 at the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul. Saudi Arabia has said he was killed in a fistfight, but Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Tuesday that Khashoggi’s death was part of a planned operation.
“It appears, on the eve of the murder, 15 Saudi security personnel, intelligence officials and a forensics expert arrived in our country,” Erdogan said. “It has been ascertained that six of them left on Oct. 2” later that evening on two planes.
“The Saudi Arabian administration has taken an important step by admitting the murder,” Erdogan said. “As of now we expect of them to openly bring to light those responsible — from the highest ranked to the lowest — and to bring them to justice.”
On Monday, Trump told reporters at the White House: “We’re going to get to the bottom of it. We have people over in Saudi Arabia now. We have top intelligence people in Turkey.”
“We’re going to know a lot over the next two days about the Saudi situation,” said Trump. “It’s a very sad thing.”

The CIA declined to confirm that Gina Haspel, who directs the agency, is in Turkey. But a U.S. official said she is in the country to review the case. The official, who declined to disclose details about what Haspel is doing in Turkey, was not authorized to discuss the trip publicly and spoke only on condition of anonymity.
Trump spoke Sunday with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who is the son of Saudi King Salman.
“He says he is not involved nor is the king,” Trump told USA Today in an interview aboard Air Force One Monday en route to a political rally in Texas. The newspaper said Trump declined to say whether he believed the crown prince’s denials. If their involvement was proven, Trump said: “I would be very upset about it. We’ll have to see.”
Trump characterized Khashoggi’s incident as a “plot gone awry” and told the newspaper he didn’t think the writer was deliberately lured into the consulate to be killed.
When he was asked late last week whether he thought Saudi Arabia’s claim that Khashoggi died in a fistfight was credible, the president answered: “I do. I do.”
That statement rankled members of Congress and former government officials who have accused Riyadh of trying to cover up the truth behind Khashoggi’s death or hide any evidence that the kingdom, particularly the crown prince, authorized it.
Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., who has been trying to coax Trump into ending arms sales to Saudi Arabia, said Monday that it’s “laughable” to believe the crown prince was not involved in Khashoggi’s death.
Trump said any U.S. response should not involve scrapping billions of dollars in arms sales, which would hurt U.S. defense industries and eliminate U.S. jobs. “I don’t want to lose all of that investment that’s being made in our country,” he said.
White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Trump will continue to demand answers. “He’ll make a determination on what he wants to do once he feels like he has all of the information that he needs,” she said.
Whatever the U.S. response, U.S. ties with its Gulf ally have hit rough waters. The Khashoggi affair also has threatened to upend the relationship of Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner with the crown prince.
The two men — both in their 30s, both trusted aides of older, familial leaders — struck a bond last spring and consulted with one another frequently in private calls in the months that followed. The crown prince, who is known in diplomatic circles as “MBS,” has drawn some praise in the West for his moves to modernize the kingdom and criticism for his government’s arrests of rivals and critics.
Trump now plays down the relationship, saying the crown prince and Kushner are “just two young guys.” But their back-channel relationship unnerved many in the Trump administration and Washington foreign policy establishment who feared that the White House was betting too big on the crown prince.
Kushner on Monday fended off criticism that the Trump administration was giving Saudi Arabia cover. He said administration officials have their “eyes wide open.”
“We’re getting facts in from multiple places and once those facts come in, the secretary of state will work with our national security team to help us determine what we want to believe, what we think is credible and what we think is not credible,” Kushner told CNN.
Even Trump, however, acknowledges that Kushner’s work on trying to craft peace between Israel and the Palestinians has been set back by Khashoggi’s death. “There are a lot of setbacks. This is a setback for that,” Trump told The Washington Post in a weekend phone interview.
Bruce Riedel, a former Middle East specialist for the CIA and National Security Council, said the Trump administration “desperately wants the Istanbul affair to go away and the MBS-Jared bromance obscured.”
An administration official who regularly deals with Kushner pushed back against claims that Kushner and the crown prince are joined at the hip. The official was not authorized to discuss the relationship and spoke only on condition of anonymity.
The official said Kushner — like other members of the administration, including Trump — believes Saudi Arabia should suffer some sort of consequence, but said Kushner also believes the U.S.-Saudi relationship “shouldn’t be blown up” because of the Khashoggi matter.

With weeks to go before Election Day, Trump is seeking to drive Republican turnout with his hard-line immigration policies. He cast the November choice in stark terms before the Houston rally for Republican Sen. Ted Cruz, saying Democrats “have launched an assault on the sovereignty of our country.”
Trump spoke before a massive crowd on behalf of his former foe, who faces a strong challenge from Democratic Rep. Beto O’Rourke. When the two competed in the 2016 Republican presidential primary, Trump would frequently deride his rival as “Lyin’ Ted” but said in Texas that their relationship had come a long way.
“Nobody has helped me more with your tax cut, with your regulation,” Trump said, also attacking O’Rourke, as a “stone-cold phony.”

With the midterms drawing near, Trump has emphasized immigration, targeting a migrant caravan heading to the U.S. southern border. The president’s focus on immigration politics comes as he seeks to counter Democratic enthusiasm in November. Trump believes that his campaign pledges, including his much vaunted — and still-unfulfilled — promise to quickly build a U.S.-Mexico border wall, are still rallying cries.
Trump is betting that his latest focus will further erode the enthusiasm gap that began to close during the debate over Brett Kavanaugh, Trump’s nominee for the Supreme Court. But the approach offers both risks and rewards.
The hard-line rhetoric may be popular among the red-state rural Republicans who will play an outsized role in the top Senate contests. But it may further alienate the moderate Republicans and women in the overwhelmingly suburban races that will decide the House majority — including several in Texas, California and Florida that feature large Hispanic populations.
On Monday night, Trump called the caravan an “assault on our country” and suggested, without citing evidence, that “Democrats had something to do with it.” He added: “We need a wall built fast.”
Earlier Monday, Trump said the U.S. will begin “cutting off, or substantially reducing” aid to three Central American nations because of the caravan.
In Texas, an enthusiastic crowd packed into Houston’s Toyota Center, wearing red Make America Great Again hats and waving signs, including some with the president’s new catchphrase, “Jobs vs. Mobs.”
Speaking before Trump took the stage, Cruz made clear that their conflict was behind them and that the two were working together. His biggest applause came when he predicted that “in 2020, Donald Trump will be overwhelmingly re-elected.”
A series of elected state officials were among the warmup speakers, as well as Trump’s daughter-in-law Lara Trump and son Eric Trump, who told the audience that “we are driving the Democrats absolutely nuts.”
Trump gleefully used his latest attack line against Democrats, saying, “Democrats produce mobs, Republicans produce jobs.” He declared Democrats would be a “big risk to the American family,” and went after some of his favorite targets, including Democratic House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, California Rep. Maxine Waters, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren.
The president stressed tax cuts, the strong economy and the hurricane response in the state. He repeated his pledge for a new middle-income tax cut of about 10 percent, though he offered few details on the plan. Trump said they would be “putting it in” next week, though Congress is not in session.
Trump also criticized so-called globalists, declaring, “You know what I am? I’m a nationalist.”
Trump’s Texas stop is part of a campaign blitz that is expected to last until Election Day.
Although political relationships tend to be fluid, Trump’s appearance for Cruz is notable, given that the two were bitter enemies during the 2016 primaries. After Trump insulted Cruz’s wife and father, and Cruz refused to endorse Trump at the Republican National Convention, it was far from clear that the two would ever put it all behind them.
But they started rebuilding in the closing days of the campaign and have worked together since Trump took the White House.
The White House views Cruz as a loyal vote for his agenda. Trump promised he would come to Texas after the Senate race grew closer than expected, with O’Rourke out-fundraising Cruz and drawing large and enthusiastic crowds around the state. Cruz, who is leading O’Rourke in the polls, said over the summer that he would welcome Trump’s support, though he has brushed off any suggestion he’d need Trump to win.
During the 2016 Republican primary, Trump assailed Cruz as a liar and “dishonest politician,” insulted his wife’s appearance and promoted unsubstantiated claims that Cruz’s father had links to President John F. Kennedy’s assassin, Lee Harvey Oswald.
Trump on Monday did not voice any second thoughts about labeling Cruz the son of a presidential killer, telling reporters, “I don’t regret anything.”
Cruz gave back as good as he got in 2016. He savaged Trump as a “pathological liar,” an “amoral bully” and a “sniveling coward.” After Cruz lost the primary, he gave a speech at the Republican National Convention in which he did not endorse Trump and instead called on Republicans to “vote your conscience,” drawing boos from the crowd. But he announced his support about a month before Election Day — and won points in Trump’s camp for not withdrawing after the “Access Hollywood” tape was released in which Trump bragged about groping women.

But today’s archaeology is not just about retrieving artifacts and drawing maps by hand. It also uses the tools of today: 3D imaging, LiDAR scans, GPS mapping and more.
Today, nearly all archaeological fieldwork in the U.S. is executed by private firms in response to legal mandates for historic preservation, at a cost of about a billion dollars annually. However, only a minuscule fraction of the data from these projects is made accessible or preserved for future research, despite agencies’ clear legal obligations to do so. Severe loss of these data is not unusual – it’s the norm.
Unanswered questions
Federally mandated projects yield massive amounts of irreplaceable data, particularly on Native American history. Those data are generated for the explicit purpose of benefiting the American public.
The primary data include things like counts of different kinds of artifacts; information on fragments of plant and animals found in fire pits; maps and photographs of ruined buildings; dates from charred roof beams; and the chemical composition of paint on pottery. This allows researchers to understand life in the past – inferring, for example, human population size and movement, social organization, trade and diet.
The data further enable archaeologists to study social processes that are important in today’s world, but that operate so slowly that they aren’t perceptible on time scales available in other social sciences. Why does migration occur? Why do migrant groups maintain their identities in some circumstances and adopt new ones in others? What factors have allowed some societies to persist over very long time periods?
However, this sort of synthetic research depends upon online access to a wealth of research data and unpublished technical reports. Access to these data also gives the researchers the ability to replicate the work of or correct errors by the original investigators.
What’s more, for many, ancestral sites are critical to maintaining identity and purpose in an increasing global world. Government agencies are responsible for appropriately managing sites for their scientific, cultural and educational values. But to do so effectively, they must have access to full documentation of past investigations.
Preserving the data
About 30,000 legally mandated archaeological investigations are conducted each year in the U.S. These projects are usually documented only in so-called “gray literature” reports that, in most cases, are not readily accessible, even to professional archaeologists.
The databases that contain the project data are even less frequently adequately documented, made accessible to other researchers or preserved in a way that will make them likely to be usable in a few years, much less 20 or 50 years. Data may be stored on media that degrade, like punch cards, floppy disks or magnetic tape. Hard disks on office computers or servers may fail, and database software can become obsolete, making the data unreadable. Data may become a victim to institutional housekeeping if files not used within a certain period of time are automatically deleted.
As a professional archaeologist and former president of the Society for American Archaeology, I believe that archaeologists have an ethical obligation to ensure that the digital records of what is discovered, like the artifacts, remain available for study in the future.
There are digital repositories expressly designed to make archaeological information discoverable, accessible and preserved permanently for future use. At my university, I led the initial development of the Digital Archaeological Record (tDAR), which has been publicly available for eight years. tDAR allows archaeologists to directly upload databases, documents, photographs, GIS files and other necessary data. The cost to upload a document or image is typically US$5, while the cost for a database depends on its size. This includes costs of permanently preserving the file and making it continuously accessible.
A similar service is available through the University of York’s Archaeology Data Service in the U.K., which has been around for more than 20 years.
I believe that for all newly authorized projects, agencies must ensure that the full digital record of their archaeological investigations is deposited in a recognized digital repository. That information would then become available not only to researchers and agency personnel, but also to the public. The cost for doing this is about 1 to 3 percent of the archaeological project cost, with lower percentages for larger projects.
Agencies also need to begin properly curating the data from projects that have already been completed. Notably, at tDAR, this process has been started by a number of U.S. agencies, including the Air Force, the Army Corps of Engineers and a few offices at the Bureau of Reclamation and the National Park Service.
Federal agencies are already legally required to preserve the digital records of publicly funded archaeological investigations. They just aren’t doing it. To avoid this is to ignore not only their legal obligations and their obligations to the American public, it is to consign the data – and all that can be learned from them – to oblivion.

The numbers come as President Donald Trump is reportedly considering another policy that could result in additional family separations at the border.
The federal government’s “zero tolerance policy” resulted in the family separations of more than 2,600 children along the Southwest border earlier this year.
When asked about the possible policy, first reported by The Washington Post, Trump said the new policy under consideration was a response to recent an increase in border crossings. “We’re looking at everything that you could look at when it comes to illegal immigration,” he said.
Here’s a look at what can happen next in the ongoing fight over family separations at the border.
The latest government government data released Monday said that of the 2,654 separated migrant children, 2,363 children have been “discharged.” This means the children were either reunified with their parents or released to another sponsor within the U.S.
The federal government said an additional 67 children had been discharged since last week’s status update.
To date, 66 children remain in government custody, according to the court document. The parents of 50 of those children are no longer in the U.S.
In that same group of 66, one child is younger than 5 years old, of the more than 100 children in this age group separated under the “zero tolerance” policy.
Here’s how the U.S. further breaks down the numbers of the children who remain separated:
50 parents are presently outside the U.S.
16 parents are currently inside the U.S. Of this group:
In recent weeks, the government has also identified additional children whom it has deemed no longer viable class members of a lawsuit brought against the Trump administration by the American Civil Liberties Union. The ACLU has been asking for further scrutiny of this group of removed class members. According to the latest status update, this group of children includes:
The federal government said it was continuing to broker three-way phone calls with the ACLU to reach removed parents. Both parties, in past hearings, told U.S. District Court Judge Dana Sabraw that these calls — between parents, a case manager and the ACLU — have been successful in reaching parents who had been deported back to their home countries.
Sabraw, who has been overseeing the family reunification effort, has said since the beginning of these hearings that the “chaotic circumstances” stemming from this policy were of the government’s own making.
In late September, after several weeks of negotiation between the government and the ACLU, the judge said that the case appeared to be drawing to “some meaningful closure” in the weeks ahead.
But while the numbers reveal the family separations still at play — including the parents who were deported without their children — there are also migrants who remain in U.S. family detention centers awaiting their chances at asylum together. In other words, even after reunification, some migrant families face an uncertain future in detention centers while waiting for their immigration cases to proceed.
One option weighed by the administration, as reported by the Post: Migrant families seeking asylum can be detained for up to 20 days, at which point they must decide whether to stay together in detention waiting for their cases to proceed or choose separation. This would involve children being transferred to a government shelter so other family members could claim custody.
Federal officials believe this can be done legally.
A DHS official told the NewsHour that the government said in a previous court proposal subsequently approved by Sabraw that parents could decide to reunite with their child while in detention and waive their child’s right to certain protections provided by the Flores agreement, which includes a 20-day ceiling for how long children can remain in detention.
If the government presses forward with this option, the ACLU will undoubtedly push back.
“The government need not, and legally may not, indiscriminately detain families who present no flight risk or danger,” ACLU attorney Lee Gelernt said in an email to the Post. “It is deeply troubling that this Administration continues to look for ways to cause harm to small children.”
DHS spokeswoman Katie Waldman told the NewsHour that there “is currently a crisis at our Southern border as we encounter rising numbers of adults who enter the country illegally with children,” adding that the administration was examining a range of options to secure the border.
Trump, too, brought up the rise in border crossing at the U.S.-Mexico border last week.
“We have people trying to come in like never before,” Trump told reporters Saturday, adding that he believed the notable increase of arrivals is because of the strengthening U.S. economy.
Immigration officials are “going to do whatever we can do to get it slowed down,” Trump said.
The number of migrant families apprehended at the border jumped 38 percent from July to August, according to Customs and Border Protection’s monthly statistics.
Migration experts have long explained how migration patterns at the border can change depending on the season. The Washington Office on Latin America (WOLA), in their reaction to the latest government data, said the number “tends to increase from July to August due to seasonal trends.”
The Trump administration has blamed the increase on “loopholes” in the U.S. immigration system. The president and his administration have characterized the nation’s laws as lax in deterring the flow of illegal crossings. Waldman, in her statement, said these loopholes “incentivize illegal border-crossers to take this dangerous journey because they are unlikely to face consequences for their illegal conduct and in fact will almost certainly be released.”
Yet migration experts have questioned whether this type of deterrent strategy would work with today’s arrivals at the border, “which include humanitarian migrants facing intense pressure to flee,” the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute wrote.

Trump welcomed Pinera to the Oval Office days after he imposed financial sanctions on members of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro’s inner circle and suggested Maduro could be ousted in a military coup as a way to restore the country’s democracy. Tens of thousands of Venezuelan migrants are in Chile.

“Venezuela is a mess and it’s got to be cleaned up and people have to be taken care of,” Trump said in response to a question from a reporter.
It was Pinera’s first visit to the White House since he returned to Chile’s presidency last spring.
Chile has been watching Trump’s trade fight with China, which is Chile’s largest trading partner. Chile is the world’s largest exporter of copper and its central bank has raised concerns about the U.S.-China trade and a decline in copper prices.
In front of the cameras, however, it was all pleasantries for two billionaires who were entrepreneurs before entering politics in their respective countries.
Trump praised Chile as “one of the most beautiful countries in the world” and raved about the South American country’s coastline. Pinera said the two nations were “likeminded countries.”
In a show of solidarity with his American counterpart, Pinera displayed for Trump a printout of a red-white-and-blue American flag that contained the outline of a small Chilean flag.
“This is the American flag, and there is the Chilean flag, right at the very heart of the U.S. flag,” Pinera said holding the print-out, bringing a smile to Trump’s face."

The daylong trip by Francis to the Mediterranean island where the Cosa Nostra is rooted marked the 25th anniversary of the assassination of the Rev. Giuseppe “Pino” Puglisi’s assassination. Puglisi was declared a martyr by the Vatican and beatified in 2013, the last formal step before possible sainthood.
Francis paid tribute to the priest, who worked to keep unemployed youths in a poor neighborhood of Palermo from turning to local Mafia bosses for jobs like pushing drugs. The papal pilgrimage came in counterpoint to the latest revelations about priests and bishops who sexually abused children or connived to protect the abusers in various nations, disclosures battering the highest levels of the church and testing the faith of rank-and-file Catholics.
Tens of thousands of people cheered Francis at an open air Mass held in the late morning at an esplanade along the port city’s waterfront. “Let’s renew the church,” read a large banner carried by young people in the crowd as Francis was driven by in his white popemobile.
Pressure is building on Francis to say what he knew about the sexual misconduct of U.S. prelate Theodore McCarrick, who recently was stripped of his cardinal’s rank by the pope.

In a city where local bosses exert their sway, often just by walking through the neighborhood, and many business owners systematically pay Cosa Nostra “protection” money to stay open, Francis drew applause as he told the crowd: “If the Mafioso litany is, ‘you don’t know who I am,’ the Christian one is ‘I need you.’ If the Mafia threat is ‘you will pay me,’ the Christian prayer is ‘Lord, help me to love.'”
“Thus I say to the Mafiosi: change, brothers and sisters. Quit thinking about yourselves and your money,” Francis continued in his homily.
“You know, a funeral shroud doesn’t have pockets. You can’t take it with you,” Francis said of organized crime’s ill-gained wealth from drug and arms trafficking, extortion and betting and prostitution rackets.
“You give life to others, not take it away. You can’t believe in God and hate your brother, take away life with hatred,” Francis said in his homily.
On his 56th birthday, Puglisi was fatally shot in the neck on the doorstep of his home by a gunman that courts later ruled was carrying out orders by Mafia bosses irritated by the priest’s efforts to encourage young people to turn their backs on the mob.
The pope later visited the apartment building where Puglisi lived and laid a bouquet of roses on the sidewalk where a memorial marks the location of the priest’s slaying. Francis also prayed silently in front of Puglisi’s tomb in Palermo’s cathedral.

Puglisi was gunned down a few months after Pope John Paul II, during a pilgrimage to Sicily, angrily demanded that mobsters convert their hearts or face the wrath of God at the end of their lives. At that time, the island was still shocked by the 1992 bombing assassinations, by Cosa Nostra, of Italy’s top anti-Mafia magistrates.
The gunman later turned state’s evidence, testifying that Puglisi turned to him with a smile and said he was expecting to be killed.
Francis’ denunciation of the Mafia prompted praise from Italy’s interior minister, Matteo Salvini, who in a tweet called the pope’s words “holy” and vowed to use more police and funds in the state’s war against Cosa Nostra.
Coming from the populist minister, the compliment was unusual. Salvini’s anti-migrant policies clash with the pope’s frequent appeals for more, not less, solidarity with people in need.

https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/election-seen-as-test-of-immigration-swedish-identity,migrant,517,2018-09-09T14:10:02-04:00,"Pietro Decristofaro, Associated Press",Exit poll projects mixed voter message in Sweden election,"STOCKHOLM — An exit poll indicated that Sweden’s first general election since the Scandinavian country accepted a significant number of asylum-seekers was likely to have the center-left party governing now as its winner, but an anti-immigrant party with white supremacist roots placing second in balloting Sunday.
Public broadcaster SVT said immediately after polls closed that its exit poll indicated the ruling Social Democrats would remain Sweden’s largest party, but making its worst-ever showing with 26.2 percent of the vote.
The exit poll projected the far-right Sweden Democrats would get 19.2 percent of Sunday’s vote after Swedes had the opportunity to make their views on immigration known at polling places.
The Swedish government in 2015 allowed 163,000 migrants into the country with a population of 10 million. The number was far lower than the asylum-seekers Germany accepted that year, but the highest per capita of any European nation.
Ahead of the election, promising prospects for the Sweden Democrats had many Swedes worried about an erosion of the humanitarian values that have long been a foundation of their country’s identity.
“This election is a referendum about our welfare,” Prime Minister Stefan Lofven said. “It’s also about decency, about a decent democracy … and not letting the Sweden Democrats, an extremist party, a racist party, get any influence in the government.”
About 7.5 million voters were eligible to choose the next members of the 349-seat Riksdag, or parliament. About 6,300 candidates sought the four-year terms. It was unlikely any single party would secure a majority of 175 seats.
The latest opinion poll conducted by pollster Novus for public broadcaster SVT suggested Friday that Lofven’s ruling Social Democrats would lose a substantial number of seats, but emerge with about one-fourth of the vote — the most support predicted for any party. The party has dominated Swedish politics in the post-World War II era.

The Sweden Democrats — led by Jimmie Akesson — has worked to soften its neo-Nazi image while helping to break down longstanding taboos on what Swedes could say openly about immigration and integration without being shunned as racists.
During a heated debate among party leaders Friday, Akesson caused a stir by blaming migrants for the difficulties they often have in finding employment and not adjusting to Sweden.
The broadcaster that aired the televised debate, SVT, afterward called his remarks degrading and against the democratic mandate of public broadcasting.
Akesson responded that state television shouldn’t take sides, and later announced that he wouldn’t take part in any of SVT’s election programs Sunday.
At the party’s rally on Saturday, he strongly criticized Lofven’s government for “prioritizing” the cause of immigrants over the needs of citizens.
“This government we have had now . they have prioritised, during these four years, asylum-seekers,” Akesson said, giving an exhaustive list of things he says the government has failed to do for Swedish society because of migrants.

Here’s where he stands on key issues,"The U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee on Tuesday will begin its hearings on the nomination of Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court. Should you care?
The court on which Kavanaugh is a judge — the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit — generally lacks the kind of potential media blockbusters coming to the Supreme Court. Instead, it has a steady diet of direct impact challenges. The nature of those cases may directly affect the air Americans breathe, the water they drink, their ability to negotiate better working conditions and more. His court often has been called the second-most important court in the country because its main responsibility is to review federal agency actions, and those actions touch American lives in concrete and myriad ways.
READ MORE: The politics behind Brett Kavanaugh’s nomination and the Senate battle ahead
How Kavanaugh has ruled in those cases is a good indication of the kind of justice he could be, and that is one compelling reason why it’s important to care about the Senate hearings.
There is no question about Kavanaugh’s qualifications to be a Supreme Court justice. He has a golden resume — Yale Law, Supreme Court clerkship, and most relevant of all, his 12 years on the appellate bench. For some senators, that is enough to confirm him. Presidential elections have consequences, some say, and one is that presidents should get the nominees they choose unless there is a major problem. History shows that confirmations can be more complicated than that view. Ideology has and does count.
As the hearings for Kavanaugh unfold this week, senators will question Kavanaugh on a broad range of topics. But here are five likely to draw the most questions.
Though there are some exceptions, Kavanaugh generally is a pro-employer judge. He reads the nation’s anti-job bias laws narrowly and leans in favor of companies over unions. One example in the job discrimination area is his dissent in Miller v. Clinton, in which U.S. citizen working as a safety inspector at the U.S. embassy in Paris sued the U.S. State department for terminating his employment when he turned 65, charging age discrimination.
The State Department argued that the Basic Authorities Act under which Miller was hired exempted him from the protections of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act. But the majority on the D.C. Circuit majority disagreed. Chief Judge Merrick Garland wrote: “If Congress had intended to authorize the State Department to act without regard to the antidiscrimination laws, would it have done so using a string of forty-five words that has previously only been read to authorize a waiver of the regulatory and statutory provisions that govern federal contracting and procurement? We do not think so.”
READ MORE: Where Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh stands on key business issues
Kavanaugh, dissenting, read the contract statute differently: “The statute authorizes the Secretary to negotiate employment contracts for American workers abroad without regard to statutory provisions relating to the performance of contracts and performance of work in the United States. The ADEA is a statute relating to the performance of contracts and performance of work in the United States—and the majority opinion never seriously denies that point. That basic analysis resolves the case.”
Kavanaugh’s views on this and other union issues are similar to those held by the Supreme Court’s conservative justices: Chief Justice John Roberts Jr. and justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito Jr. and Neil Gorsuch.
Kavanaugh could push the Supreme Court in the direction of more aggressive gun rights. In 2011, he dissented from a three-judge ruling (written by conservative Judge Douglas Ginsburg) upholding the District of Columbia’s ban on assault weapons and magazines with the capacity of more than 10 rounds of ammunition. Kavanaugh would have struck down both bans.
The Supreme Court in its landmark 2008 decision in District of Columbia v. Heller protected an individual’s right to possess a gun in the home for self defense. The justices have declined to take up challenges to regulations of semi-automatic rifles, magazine capacities, open carry and other gun restrictions, over strong objections by Thomas and the late Justice Antonin Scalia. Gorsuch recently joined Thomas’ complaints about the court’s treatment of the Second Amendment. Kavanaugh could well be another vote for the court to wade back into the fire of the Second Amendment.

The Supreme Court’s conservative majority over the years has generally not been sympathetic to government attempts to regulate under the nation’s major environmental laws. The last major victory for states and environmentalists was the 2007 decision in Massachusetts v. EPA, in which the court’s four liberal members, with the help of Justice Anthony Kennedy, held that the Clean Air Act authorized a recalcitrant Environmental Protection Agency to regulate carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases.
READ MORE: The left’s strategy to block Kavanaugh from the Supreme Court
Kavanaugh, according to many environmental law scholars and groups, has a strong record in favor of industry interests in this area of the law. They point particularly to the time Kavanaugh broke with his two conservative colleagues to defend the George W. Bush Administration’s move to relax Clean Air Act monitoring requirements. A number of states sought to fill the gaps by enacting their own air pollution protections. The majority read the act to allow the states to take that kind of action; Kavanaugh disagreed. One scholar also has noted that Kavanaugh appears to have never dissented from a ruling against an environmental interest.
Without Kennedy, Kavanaugh could be a critical vote in coming challenges involving climate change.
Kavanaugh believes in what is known as the unitary executive theory. Under that theory, the president has full responsibility for the execution of federal laws and must be able to control all agency officers. We saw the strongest example of this in Kavanaugh’s majority decision holding that the structure of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau violated the Constitution’s separation of powers.The constitutional problem with the consumer bureau, he concluded, was that its director could only be removed by the president for cause.
His views on the unitary executive will trigger questions from senators concerned about President Donald Trump’s claims that he could interfere with U.S. Justice Department actions and shut down special counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation. But Kavanaugh’s views could also influence how the Supreme Court responds to challenges to other independent federal agencies structured in a similar fashion to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.
On another front, though Kavanaugh actively participated in the independent counsel investigation of President Bill Clinton in the 1990s, he has more recently concluded that presidents should be temporarily immune from criminal investigations and civil suits while in office. Such investigations, usually involving testimony and depositions, pose a substantial burden on a president’s ability to perform the office’s duties, he has written. Kavanaugh also believes Congress is the body envisioned by the Constitution to investigate and take action in the face of presidential malfeasance.

Reproductive rights activists have worried about how Kavanaugh might rule on the Supreme Court.
The point to a case last October, when the majority on the D.C. court ruled that the Trump administration was putting an undue burden on a young pregnant migrant by blocking her from getting an abortion.
Kavanaugh dissented, saying it wasn’t wrong for the government to make her wait to get a sponsor before allowing her to consider an abortion."

Iran-backed Houthi rebels have for years battled for control of Yemen, and a Saudi-led coalition is fighting in support of the ousted government under President Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi, who fled the country in 2015. It’s created what U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and others have described as “the world’s worst humanitarian crisis.”
The 41-page report from the so-called Group of Experts, established by the U.N.’s Human Rights Council, cataloged acts of violence that occurred between September 2014 and June 2018. Here’s what we know.

The group, made up of three regional specialists from Tunisia, Australia and the UK, visited at least four Yemeni cities to document accounts of residents and alleged victims.
Their findings include:
“The primary legal responsibility for addressing these violations and crimes lies with the government of Yemen, which bears the duty to protect persons under its jurisdiction,” said Kamel Jendoubi, the group’s chairman. “I call upon the government of Yemen to investigate and prosecute violations that amount to crimes by their nationals and armed forces.”
Defense Secretary Jim Mattis on Tuesday defended the U.S. backing of the Saudi-led coalition, but said it was conditioned on the Saudis doing “everything humanly possible” to avoid civilian casualties.
“For the last several years we have been working with the Saudis and the Emiratis, doing what we can to reduce any chance of innocent people being injured or killed,” he said.
More than 22 million people — three-quarters of the population — in Yemen are in need of aid, according to Guterres.
Earlier this month, an airstrike hit a school bus driving through a market in a rebel stronghold in northern Yemen, killing dozens, including 40 children. The Saudi-led coalition said it was targeting rebels who had fired a missile at Saudi Arabia. The military coalition is investigating the incident.
The top U.S. commander in the Middle East and Southwest Asia, Lt. Gen. Jeffrey Harrigian, who is stepping down this week, did not comment on the school bus strike in an interview with The New York Times, citing the ongoing investigation. But, he said, “clearly, we’re concerned about civilian casualties, and they know about our concern,” referring to Saudi officials.
Kristine Beckerle, the Yemen researcher at Human Rights Watch, which recently issued its own report, said on Friday’s PBS NewsHour that the U.S. has been “tight-lipped” about the kind of support it is providing the coalition.
“What we do know is they are providing this midair refueling, but the U.S. won’t tell us which aircraft, for example, it refueled. Did it refuel the coalition aircraft that bombed a market, a home, a hospital, a wedding?” she said.
The U.N. report says further investigation of violations and abuses is required."

For conservatives, news of Tibbetts’ death — particularly that police had arrested an undocumented immigrant from Mexico in connection with her murder — quickly became the latest evidence that the nation’s immigration laws and border security are weak, an argument they have repeated often in the runup to the 2018 midterms.
President Donald Trump used the case to promote his administration’s hardline stance against illegal immigration at a Tuesday rally in West Virginia, and again in a video released from the White House’s Twitter account on Wednesday.
Here’s a look why it’s become part of the national debate on immigration.
On Tuesday, police formally charged Christhian Bahena Rivera with first-degree murder in Tibbetts’ death after identifying him on a home surveillance video, following Tibbetts in his car. He directed authorities to a farm field southeast of Brooklyn, Iowa, where a body believed to be Tibbetts’ was found, court documents said.
When local law enforcement made the announcement Tuesday, officials referred to the 24-year-old suspect as an “illegal alien.” Conservative circles online and on-air zeroed in on that description as a way of pointing to what they described as a growing body of evidence that immigrants here illegally carry out violent crimes.
Fox News, along with other conservative media outlets, dedicated long periods of its broadcasts to covering the story, often linking the murder case to insufficient U.S. immigration laws. Their coverage aired on the same day a jury in Virginia found former Trump campaign chair Paul Manafort guilty and Michael Cohen, Trump’s former attorney, pleaded guilty to federal charges in New York.
The president emphasized Rivera’s immigration status during Tuesday’s rally in Charleston, West Virginia.
“You saw what happened to that incredible, beautiful woman,” Trump said of Tibbetts. “Should have never happened. … The immigration laws are such a disgrace. We’re getting them changed.”
Because the case has become a focal point for the president and Republicans, national media outlets have taken notice.
Among the strongest rebukes to how the news of Tibbetts’ death has been handled are those that come directly from her family members.
“Please remember, Evil comes in EVERY color,” Billie Jo Calderwood, Mollie’s aunt, said in a post on Facebook.
Sam Lucas, who told the Washington Post she was a distant cousin of Tibbetts’, responded to conservative activist’s Candace Owens tweets that linked immigrants to crime, saying, “hey i’m a member of mollie’s family and we are not so f*****g small-minded that we generalize a whole population based on some bad individuals.”
She added: “now stop being a f*****g snake and using my cousins death as political propaganda. take her name out of your mouth.”
A day after authorities formally charged Rivera, the White House tweeted out a new video on its official account, saying that the “Tibbetts family has been permanently separated. They are not alone.”
For 34 days, investigators searched for 20-year-old Mollie Tibbetts. Yesterday, an illegal alien, now charged with first-degree murder, led police to the cornfield where her body was found.

The video shows several parents looking into the camera, saying that their children were killed by immigrants. At the end, they’re edited to say in succession: “My separation is permanent.” The video, in effect, appears to push back on criticism of the administration’s practice of separating migrant families as a result of its “zero tolerance” policy.
Several sitting Republicans and those seeking office this fall have used the case to paint Democrats as weak on borders and security.
“Mollie would be alive if our government had taken immigration enforcement seriously years ago,” Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., wrote on Twitter.
“The lack of leadership & courage by open border senators like @JeffFlake, @SenJohnMcCain, & #amnesty advocate Martha McSally contribute to these senseless deaths,” Kelli Ward ,a former Arizona state senator who is now seeking a U.S. Senate seat, wrote on Twitter. “We need true leadership in the Senate to #BuildTheWall & secure our borders!”
Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich emailed Axios to see if the online publication was covering the story, and commented on the political stakes at play: “If Mollie Tibbetts is a household name by October, Democrats will be in deep trouble. If we can be blocked by Manafort-Cohen, etc., then GOP could lose [the House] badly.”
Trump, before Tibbetts’ death, and particularly during his presidential campaign, has appeared on stage with several families whose relatives have been killed by people who entered the U.S. illegally. They identify as “angel families” or “Angel Moms.” At events with the angel families, including the latest in June, the president says these people are “permanently separated” from their children.

“You hear the other side, you never hear this side,” Trump said at his June event.
The idea that illegal immigration causes more crime has been disproven by several different studies.
A 2015 study of Texas Department of Public Safety data showed that native-born Americans had higher rates of arrests and convictions than those here illegally — something that holds true across different types of crimes, the study, from the libertarian Cato Institute, said.
Another study published in March shows that, contrary to a popular conservative talking point, areas with larger populations of undocumented immigrants have lower crime rates.
But, as FactCheck.org has pointed out, there is a lack of readily available statistics that breaks down crime rates by immigration status. Part of this is because local law enforcement doesn’t always distinguish when a crime is committed by legal or undocumented immigrants.
At the same time, the statistical conclusions that point to immigrants committing fewer crimes is also not discussed when the issue is pushed by conservatives activists, pundits and the administration.
“It’s Mollie Tibbetts (today), and it could be your daughter, your sister, your friend tomorrow,” conservative commentator Tomi Lahren said in an interview with Fox News.

Preliminary autopsy results released Thursday confirmed the body found by police in the cornfield was Tibbetts’ and that the manner of death was “homicide resulting from multiple sharp force injuries.”
Officials said earlier this week that Rivera has lived in the state for at least four years, something his employer Yarrabee Farms confirmed.
Rivera’s lawyer, Allen Richards, also requested a gag order in the case Wednesday, saying that the government has falsely said that his client has been in the state illegally. “Sad and sorry Trump has weighed in on this matter in national media which will poison the entire possible pool of jury members,” he said. A judge denied the request, Des Moines Register reported.
Federal agencies maintain that Rivera was in the country illegally. A spokesperson for the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services told the PBS NewsHour in a statement that a “search of records by USCIS revealed Rivera did not make any DACA requests nor were any grants given. We have found no record in our systems indicating he has any lawful immigration status.”
The Iowa Department of Transportation also said, after reviewing its records, the agency can confirm “that no Iowa driver’s license or credential was issued to Cristhian Bahena Rivera, either under that name or any alternate name bearing his likeness and we have no license history for him.”
In a news conference Wednesday, Dane Lang, co-owner of Yarrabee Farms, told reporters that “our employee is not who he said he was,” adding that it appeared that Rivera provided them with false information. Reporters asked for any fake name the suspect did give, but Lang declined to provide that information.

The president was honoring employees of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the Customs and Border Protection. The federal agencies have been thrust into the debate over the Trump administration’s separation of migrant children from their parents after they illegally crossed the U.S.-Mexico border.
“We love you, we support you, we will always have your back,” Trump said. He added: “For America to be a strong nation, we must have strong borders.”
Trump has assailed some Democratic lawmakers for seeking to abolish ICE ahead of the November midterm elections. In a letter to state and local leaders, Trump wrote that ICE workers had been subjected to a “nationwide campaign of smears, insults and attacks” by politicians “catering to the extreme elements in our society.”
At the White House event, Trump said that most people support ICE and that opponents are “just a small group that gets a lot of publicity.”
“They have no courage, they have no guts, they just have big loud mouths,” Trump said.

Trump has made border security a key part of his message as he tries to maintain Republican control of Congress in the November elections.
Before the president arrived, the White House held a panel discussion on immigration with several state and local officials, who pointed to the role that a secure border plays in the fight against terrorism and drug trafficking and questioned calls to abolish ICE.
Republican Sen. David Perdue of Georgia, who has worked closely with the administration on immigration legislation, said he struggled to see the point of eliminating the federal agency, likening it to someone saying, “I want to get rid of the Marines.”
“I just think it’s unconscionable, and frankly, I think it’s downright unpatriotic and treasonous,” Perdue said."

They include a man who had his 2-year-old daughter taken because agents didn’t believe he was the father, forcing him to submit DNA evidence to prove he was the parent.
Hundreds of parents were deported, including a family in Honduras losing patience each day their 11-year-old child remains in the U.S. A father in Guatemala prefers that his teenager remain in the U.S. because it’s safer. A woman had her son given to her aunt and now remains in immigration detention due to a prior deportation.
The government and American Civil Liberties Union are waging a court fight over how to best reunify the families, but the process has been bogged down. The government on Thursday went so far to ask the ACLU to its “considerable resources” to assist with reunifications. The ACLU thinks the Trump administration needs to do more to fix the problem.
In the meantime, The Associated Press interviewed immigrants who remain separated from their children in multiple countries as well as their lawyers to capture the variety of ways the government has been unable to meet court-ordered deadlines to reunite families.
Here are their stories:
ACCUSED OF SMUGGLING SOMEONE ELSE’S CHILD
The government says it has encountered several cases where the adult coming across the border with the child was not a biological parent. They were determined to be not eligible to be reunited.
There was an apparent mistake in at least one case. Mario Perez Domingo and his 2-year-old daughter crossed into Texas on July 2. Even though the Trump administration had officially ended its policy of separating families at the border, Perez was arrested and charged with improperly entering the United States.
Agents thought Perez was the uncle and not the father, and the Texas Civil Rights Project intervened to present evidence the government was wrong.
U.S. Customs and Border Protection issued a statement that under questioning, Perez admitted that the child was actually his niece and that a smuggler had given him a false document in their native Guatemala.
But the Texas Civil Rights Project says Perez is from an indigenous community and has a poor command of Spanish. After the group obtained documents from the Guatemalan consulate showing he’s the parent, the U.S. attorney dismissed the case against Perez on July 12.
On Wednesday, the group received word that DNA testing confirmed Perez was the girl’s father. But Perez still remains in a detention facility, and his daughter is at a government shelter in Texas.
___
THE DEPORTED
Many parents say they signed deportation papers after being told they would get their children back in their home country, only for that promise to be broken.
The government says parents of about 400 children are outside the U.S., likely deported.
Eduardo Almendarez Meyer, 11, regularly sees other children leave the government facility where he is being held and get returned to their parents. In phone calls back to Honduras, he asks his mother if he’ll see her again.
It’s been more than two months since he and his father, Douglas Almendarez, were separated in Texas. Almendarez was deported to Honduras on June 13. His wife, Evelin Roxana Meyer, who stayed in their hometown to run their neighborhood grocery store, said he was told when he signed his deportation papers that his son would be waiting for him in Honduras.
After he arrived in San Pedro Sula, Almendarez waited at the airport for days, with no information.
It took weeks for someone from the U.S. to call to say Eduardo was at a shelter in Brownsville, Texas. Eventually, they got a number where they could call him twice a week, for 10 minutes each time.
At first, Eduardo could not sleep and cried on the phone, saying he wanted to go back home, his mother said. He has since calmed down and made friends, but his anxiety is rising as he watches the friends leave the shelter one by one.
“He has been suffering, just as I have as his mother,” Meyer said. “They shouldn’t be allowed to do this.”
___
CHILD GIVEN TO A SPONSOR
The government counts 444 children as having been “discharged in other appropriate circumstances.” Those circumstances included discharges to sponsors other than the parents — typically a relative — including situations where the “parent is not eligible for reunification.”
It appears that the government is refusing to release some parents after their children were given to sponsors, because the parents had previously been removed from the U.S. and came back to seek asylum. The San Antonio-based Migrant Center for Human Rights identified at least two such cases.
One of the women still detained is Vivian, a 24-year-old woman from Honduras who entered the U.S. in late April and had her 3-year-old son taken and given to her aunt.
Vivian, who asked to be identified only by her first name out of fear of endangering her immigration case, was previously deported in November 2016.
Her aunt says she calls every day, crying, from the detention facility. Her aunt puts her son on the phone, so Vivian can repeat the story they’ve agreed to tell him: She’s gone away for work but is coming back soon with an armful of toys for him.
“When he goes to sleep, he always says, ‘Where’s Mami? She sleeps next to me,’ and he starts to cry,” his aunt said.
Sara Ramey, the migrant center’s director, received a letter this week from ICE denying Vivian’s request for release without further explanation.
___
A FATHER WHO WANTS HIS CHILD TO STAY BEHIND
Some parents say they hoped that if they could not stay in America, their children would. The government says these immigrants “waived reunification,” making them a lower priority.
Selvin Argueta Caal says he left Guatemala after his son received several death threats from gang members at his school. They wanted Selvin Jr. to sell drugs, but the 17-year-old refused.
They were detained and separated at the border on May 19th, one day after their arrival. While detained by the government, the father requested asylum and told the immigration officials that he feared for his son’s life in Guatemala, but the request was denied.
He was deported to Guatemala and son was sent to a shelter for immigrant children in Houston. Caal hopes that a nephew can take in his son, but the relative apparently has been rejected by the government as a potential sponsor. When he turns 18, he will no longer be allowed in the shelter, throwing his future in doubt.
Caal says he waived reunification, but didn’t know exactly what he was signing because he did not read or speak English, and nobody translated the document to him.
“I want him to at least have freedom, that he can study and work, and that he is no longer in danger,” Caal said. “Although he is far away, he is safe, without the bad things happening here.”

https://www.pbs.org/newshour/economy/will-the-economic-boom-complicate-efforts-to-curb-immigration,migrant,1004,2018-08-03T11:49:30-04:00,"Colleen Long, Associated Press",Will the economic boom complicate efforts to curb immigration?,"WASHINGTON — One of President Donald Trump’s priorities, low unemployment, is complicating another: curbing immigration.
With the number of jobs available exceeding the number of Americans seeking jobs, employers are looking beyond the border to fill openings, and migrants are coming to the country in search of work.
Hotel and restaurant owner Todd Callewaert is short more than two dozen workers this season for his Mackinac Island, Michigan, businesses. “You can’t hire a line cook right now, it’s impossible, even for 20 bucks an hour,” he said. “We usually fill the gap with visa workers, but we can’t even get those this year.”
The Labor Department said Friday the unemployment rate was 3.9 percent, near the 18-year low set in May, and employers are adding jobs at a faster pace than last year.
Trump has made clear employers should be trying to attract American workers through wage increases and other incentives, not filling jobs with immigrants.
“Curbing immigration is essential to growing wages and ensuring available jobs go to American workers, not foreign workers,” Deputy White House Press Secretary Hogan Gidley told AP. “As immigration curbs are put into place, more and more Americans will be absorbed back into the workforce, especially those who have been left out due to poor work history or difficult life circumstances.”
The administration has made it harder to come to the U.S. for work, legally or otherwise. Work visas are costly, complicated and limited. Large-scale, job-seeking migration through a porous border is long gone.
This summer, the administration tried to deter would-be immigrants by adopting a “zero-tolerance” policy, prosecuting anyone caught crossing the border illegally. It resulted in nearly 3,000 children separated from their parents at the border, prompting international outrage. Trump eventually stopped the separations and the government was forced by a judge to reunify families.
Still, tens of thousands of people cross the border illegally every month, many seeking asylum from violence. But often, they’re coming because of the prospect of work.
Dala Edilson Ba Juc traveled with his 12-year-old daughter from Guatemala to the U.S. — only to be separated from her at the border, reunited and deported home. Sitting at an immigration facility in Guatemala City, he said they came for work.
“I needed to try to make a better life for my family — I wanted them to have what I could not give them here,” he said. “There are many, many jobs in the States.”

Frandy Frauville, 35, joined a wave of Haitians who came to Tijuana, Mexico, from Brazil starting in 2016. Brazil welcomed Haitians after Haiti’s 2010 earthquake. But Frauville grew tired of factory jobs in Mexico that barely allowed him to cover rent and food, and, lured by the prospects of better work and joining family near Miami, he lined up with his 5-year-old daughter at a border crossing.
“I’ll take whatever I can get,” he said.
And Rolando Antonio Bueso Castillo, who was separated from his infant Johan, was making only $10 a day driving a bus in Honduras. He was captured and quickly deported while his baby remained behind for five months.
He said he made the difficult journey because his brother had secured him a job in Maryland. Someday, he said, his son will ask what happened, and why he had left him in the United States.
“I’ll tell him the truth,” he said. “We thought we had a good plan to give him a better life.”
Many economists say immigration is actually good for the economy and migrants provide complementary work to the jobs Americans do. Despite Trump’s push, some business owners say they just can’t get Americans to fill the jobs.
A.J. Erskine is vice president of Cowart Seafood Group, which includes a Virginia oyster company of about 75 employees. “Entry-level is $12.13 an hour,” he said. “I don’t know how much higher we can go without being unable to sell oysters. He said the company has been in business more than a half-century, and that despite massive recruiting efforts, it can’t keep American workers.
“We just don’t have people who want to come out and shuck oysters at 3 in the morning — and I don’t blame them,” he said.
Some, like Erksine, are willing to front the cost associated with a temporary work visa, about $4,000 per employee for workers holding down seasonal, non-agricultural jobs. But the visas are capped at 66,000 annually, with 15,000 additional visas this year.
Economists say the hiring crunch could be eased in part by increasing the number of visas available during boom years, and decreasing them when the economy is weaker. But those changes must be made by Congress.
Those turning a blind eye to immigration status, or hiring people with false identification face crackdowns by immigration agents. Agents raided an Ohio garden center in the summer, arresting 114 workers and accusing the business of unlawful employment of aliens and fraud.
“It’s not worth the risk for us to hire people we’re not sure about,” said Callewaert, the hotel and restaurant owner. But a lack of staff means the business can’t grow, he said.
Rep. Dave Brat, R-Virginia., a member of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, said he did not think the lower unemployment rate would weaken efforts to restrict illegal immigration.
“The irony is it makes it more transparent what the real problem of the labor market is,” Brat said, citing about 10 million Americans not in the labor force. He called for improved education and imposing work requirements on food stamp recipients to get more of these Americans in the workforce.
“The answer is not to bring in 10 million folks from abroad,” Brat said.

One was in a dissent in the case of a 17-year-old migrant seeking to terminate her pregnancy. The other was a speech before a conservative group in which he spoke admiringly of Justice William Rehnquist’s dissent in the 1973 Roe v. Wade case that established a woman’s right to abortion.
Yet the big question about Kavanaugh’s view on abortion remains unanswered: whether he would vote to overturn Roe. He’ll almost certainly decline to answer when he is asked directly at his confirmation hearing. Decades of Kavanaugh’s writings, speeches and judicial opinions, reviewed by The Associated Press, reveal a sparse record on abortion.
That leaves the migrant case, known as Garza v. Hargan, and the Rehnquist speech as focal points for anti-abortion activists who back President Donald Trump’s nominee and for abortion rights advocates who say Kavanaugh has provided ample clues to justify their worst fears.
“This is the rhetoric from the anti-abortion groups being used by a potential Supreme Court justice, and that really gives us pause,” said Jacqueline Ayers, the national director of legislative affairs for Planned Parenthood Federation of America.

Democrats have been casting Kavanaugh as a threat to abortion rights as they face the difficult task of blocking his nomination in a Senate where Republicans hold a narrow majority. Kavanaugh’s views on other issues, such as the reach of presidential powers, will also be part of a confirmation fight. But abortion is perpetually a contentious issue for court nominees, and the stakes are particularly high this time since Kavanaugh would be replacing the moderate Justice Anthony Kennedy, who has voted to uphold abortion rights.
Garza v. Hargan landed before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, where Kavanaugh has sat since 2006, after the Department of Health and Human Services instructed shelters for immigrant minors not to do anything to facilitate abortions.
Much of the debate in the case centered on the 1992 Planned Parenthood v. Casey decision, which prohibited regulations that created an “undue burden” on women seeking an abortion. Appellate judges had to determine whether officials created such a burden by not releasing the Central American teen so she could get an abortion.
The girl, identified in filings as Jane Doe, was 15 weeks pregnant when the case came before Kavanaugh. The law in Texas — where she was being held — bars abortions after 20 weeks. Texas also requires parental consent, though a state judge waived that requirement.
In arguing that a lower court was right to approve an immediate abortion, Judge Patricia Millett said entering the U.S. illegally “does not mean that an immigrant’s body is no longer her … own” and among the penalties for crossing the border illegally should not be “forcing a child to have a baby.”
As the government prepared to appeal to the Supreme Court, the teenager had the abortion.
In his dissent, Kavanaugh accepted that the Roe v. Wade precedent applied to the teenager. He wrote that “under the Government’s arguments in this case and the Supreme Court’s precedents, the unlawful immigrant minor is assumed to have a right under precedent to an abortion.”
Kavanagh didn’t accept the government’s contention that it could stop the teen from having an abortion in the U.S. He indicated officials could stop her temporarily while they tried to identify U.S. sponsors with whom she could live and who could counsel her on the abortion decision.
To make his point, Kavanaugh drew on language sanctioning the regulation of abortion.
“The Supreme Court,” he wrote, “has repeatedly said that the Government has permissible interests in favoring fetal life, protecting the best interests of the minor, and not facilitating abortion, so long as the Government does not impose an undue burden on the abortion decision.”
His main complaint about the majority’s ruling was, he said, that it created “a new right for unlawful immigrant minors in U.S. Government detention to obtain immediate abortion on demand.” He said that “represents a radical extension of the Supreme Court’s abortion jurisprudence.”
Still, Kavanaugh faced some conservative criticism for not taking a firmer anti-abortion stance like his colleague, Karen Henderson, who stated unambiguously that an immigrant in the U.S. illegally has no right to an abortion.
But a spokeswoman for the Susan B. Anthony List, a group seeking to end abortion, said she had no qualms about Kavanaugh’s reasoning in the case. Mallory Quigley said he wrote “forcefully that government has an interest in protecting fetal life.”
Conservatives had no complaints about the speech Kavanaugh gave at the American Enterprise Institute last year in which he heralded Rehnquist as “my first judicial hero” and spoke admiringly of his dissent in Roe v. Wade.
A 7-to-2 majority in Roe v. Wade struck down a Texas law criminalizing abortion, citing an implied right to privacy in the 14th Amendment. Rehnquist’s dissent said the court had created a right “completely unknown” to drafters of the amendment.
Rehnquist also pushed to reverse Roe in Planned Parenthood v. Casey. The court ended up reaffirming abortion rights in a 5-to-4 decision instead, with Kennedy joining the majority.
“Rehnquist was not successful in convincing a majority of the justices in the context of abortion,” Kavanaugh said in the speech. “But he was successful in stemming the general tide of freewheeling judicial creation of unenumerated (implied) rights that were not rooted in the nation’s history and tradition.”
Asked about Roe at a 2006 hearing on his nomination to the federal appeals court, Kavanaugh said he would “faithfully and fully” uphold it as binding precedent. But he answered as a prospective appellate judge. His views as a justice on the Supreme Court, which isn’t as tightly bound by precedent, could be very different.
At the same hearing, Kavanaugh dodged questions about his personal beliefs on Roe v. Wade, telling an exasperated Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York that it wouldn’t be appropriate for him to “give a personal view” on the case. He’ll likely revive that response for hearings on his high-court nomination in the fall.

She said that she was “vehemently against family separation” but noted that immigration was “incredibly complex as a topic.”
The senior White House adviser also said she doesn’t view the news media as “the enemy of the people,” breaking with one of her father’s frequent attacks on the press.
President Donald Trump dropped the immigration policy more than a month ago after widespread condemnation from Democrats and Republicans. Ivanka Trump remained quiet publicly in the early days of the border crisis, but the president said she privately urged him to find a solution. She tweeted her thanks after he signed an executive order designed to keep families together.
During an event Thursday hosted by Axios, Ivanka Trump was asked about the high point and low point of her time in the White House. When the moderator asked if the separation of migrant children from detained families was a low, she agreed.
Noting that her mother was an immigrant who came to the United States legally, Ivanka Trump said this was a “country of laws.” She added: “We have to be very careful about incentivizing behavior that puts children at risk of being trafficked, risk of entering this country with coyotes or making an incredibly dangerous journey alone.”
But she said she felt “very strongly” about the issue.
“I am very vehemently against family separation and the separation of parents and children,” she said.
Asked about the comments, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said the president had said “that he doesn’t like the idea of family separation. I don’t think anybody does.”
Sanders added: “We also don’t like the idea of open borders. We don’t like the idea of allowing people into our country if we don’t know who they are, where they are going and why they’re coming. The president wants to secure our borders, which is why he has asked Congress to fix the law.”
On high points for the administration, Ivanka Trump cited the president commuting the sentence of Alice Johnson, a woman who was serving a life sentence for drug offenses and whose case had been championed by reality television star Kim Kardashian West. She called Johnson leaving prison “one of the most beautiful things I’ve ever seen.”
Asked if she agreed with the description of the press frequently invoked by her father, Ivanka Trump said, “No, I don’t.”"

—
WASHINGTON — The Senate Judiciary Committee is demanding answers from federal immigration officials about the Trump administration’s separation of migrant children from their families and its struggle to reunite them, a fraught effort that’s drawn election-year criticism from both parties.
Watch the immigration officials’ remarks in the player above.
But a hearing scheduled for Tuesday on the topic may have a wider focus after the committee’s bipartisan leaders asked federal investigators to probe reports of sexual and other abuse of immigrants at government detention facilities.
Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, and top panel Democrat Dianne Feinstein of California asked late Monday for an examination of alleged sexual, physical and emotional mistreatment of immigrants held at agency facilities, saying the problems may have been occurring since 2014 or earlier.
With President Donald Trump already under fire for taking thousands of migrant children from their detained parents — and botching the reunification of many — the request for the investigation elevated yet another issue to the administration’s list of immigration headaches.
“These allegations of abuse are extremely disturbing and must be addressed,” Grassley and Feinstein wrote in a letter to the departments of Homeland Security and Health and Human Services. “This is not a partisan issue as reporting suggests many have been occurring for years. Immigrant families and children kept in federal custody deserve to be treated with basic human dignity and respect and should never be subjected to these forms of abuse.”
READ MORE: There’s no timeline for reuniting hundreds of families who remain separated. What happens now?
Set to testify Tuesday to the Judiciary panel were officials from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the Border Patrol and other agencies.
Trump began a policy of “zero tolerance” this spring, prosecuting all migrants caught entering the U.S. without authorization. To help discourage border crossing, his administration also began separating children from their detained parents, rather than following the policy used by previous administrations, which generally released the entire family pending court action.
Under withering public rejection and criticism from congressional Democrats and Republicans alike, Trump stopped taking children from their parents. But of the more than 2,500 children held, hundreds were not reunited by last week. That includes more than 400 whose parents were deported.
U.S. District Judge Dana Sabraw in San Diego set a deadline of last Thursday to reunite the families. While he commended administration officials for reuniting many parents in its custody with their children, it faulted them for leaving hundreds of families still apart and warning that a better system must be in place.
Trump seized on the praise, tweeting Monday that “a highly respected Federal judge” had said that the “‘Trump Administration gets great credit’ for reuniting illegal families. Thank you, and please look at the previous administrations record – not good!”
The senators’ letter, based on articles by The Associated Press and other news organizations, says the allegations suggest “a long-term pattern” of mistreatment. Those reports describe claims of abuse from this year dating back to before Trump took office.
The lawmakers want the inspectors general for the departments of Homeland Security and Health and Human Services to investigate the abuse allegations immediately and to release any previous investigations into the charges. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, a branch of Homeland Security, and Health and Human Services oversee the facilities.
The AP reported last month that children held at an immigration detention facility in Roanoke, Virginia, said they were beaten while handcuffed, locked in solitary confinement and left nude and cold in concrete cells.
A civil rights lawsuit has been filed alleging mistreatment at the Shenandoah Valley Juvenile Center from 2015 to 2018. The alleged victims, Hispanic youths held for months or years, have submitted sworn statements in the case.
Lawyers for the facility have denied the alleged abuse. Many of the children have been accused by immigration officials of belonging to MS-13 and other violent gangs, an activity Trump has used to justify his “zero tolerance” policy of prosecuting immigrants caught entering the country without permission.
The senators’ letter also cited a New York Times report this month about two female migrants who described sexual abuse at detention facilities in Texas and Pennsylvania. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has reported 1,310 cases of sexual abuse against detainees from 2013 to 2017, the report said.
A June report by the website Dallas News described alleged sexual abuse at a detention center near Austin, Texas, in 2017. The Arizona Republic reported alleged inappropriate contact involving a teenage boy in 2015 and a girl who accused a staffer of making suggestive comments in 2017 at facilities in Glendale and Tucson, Arizona. The lawmakers’ letter cited those reports as well.
Homeland Security spokeswoman Katie Waldman said agency officials perform their duties “professionally and humanely” and that the agency “is abiding by the intent and letter of law and maintains the highest standards care for individuals in our custody.”

Trump said at the start of his meeting with Italy’s Giuseppe Conte that the country’s new populist government “has taken a very firm stance on the border.” The president said other European countries should follow Italy’s lead on migration issues.
“I agree very much what you’re doing with respect to migration, illegal immigration and even legal immigration,” Trump told Conte in the Oval Office.
Italy under Conte’s new government has pushed for the European Union to accept tens of thousands of migrants coming across the Mediterranean Sea every year. The meeting follows a recent standoff over a private aid boat carrying more than 200 people who were rescued at sea. Italy, Malta and France all refused to let the vessel disembark.
Trump welcomed the prime minister to the White House for the first time since the Italian leader came to power in June, bringing together two outsider leaders who have emerged from populist waves within their countries.
Conte leads the euroskeptic coalition of the 5-Star Movement, which considers itself anti-establishment, and the right-wing, north-based League party.
Trump last week avoided escalating a trade dispute with the European Union and his administration is expected to begin negotiations quickly on avoiding tariffs on automobiles and removing trade barriers.
The U.S. president noted the U.S. trade deficit with Italy, a member of the EU, and said he was certain “we’ll straighten that out pretty quickly.”
The White House has noted that Italy is an important NATO ally and a key partner to U.S. forces in Afghanistan and Iraq.
Conte, in brief remarks, thanked Trump for his “warm hospitality.” Trump told him “you’ll always be treated warmly.”"

A poll by the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research and MTV found that most Americans ages 15 to 34 think voting in the midterm elections gives their generation some say about how the government is run, and 79 percent of this group say leaders from their generation would do a better job running the country.
The poll found young people eager to vote for someone who shared their political views on issues like health care and immigration policy. They expressed far less excitement about voting for a candidate described as a lifelong politician.
“These older Congress people, they don’t understand the internet and they don’t know what they’re talking about,” said Greg Davis, a 29-year-old from Grandview, Ohio, who says he watched in exasperation last spring as Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg easily handled what was supposed to be a Senate grilling on privacy policy. “The questions that he was getting asked about security and privacy were asinine. We need leadership that actually understands tech.”
It’s true that the current Congress is among the oldest in U.S. history. At the beginning of the 115th Congress in January 2017, the average age of House members was nearly 58. The average age of senators was nearly 62, among the oldest, according to the Congressional Research Service.
Political change is in the air in 2018. A record number of women are running. Young Americans who don’t remember a time without the internet are eligible to cast ballots. Some started paying attention in 2016, after Donald Trump upset Democrat Hillary Clinton and political tensions in the U.S. escalated.
About two-thirds of the young people in the poll say they are extremely or very excited to vote for a candidate who cares about the issues that affect them and their generation, including the economy, gun policy and equal rights, along with immigration and health care. Although most say they’d be at least moderately excited to vote for younger, nonwhite and female candidates, those characteristics don’t generate as much excitement as someone who shares their political views. By contrast, fewer than half are at least moderately excited about a candidate who is a lifelong politician.
That could matter in the 2018 midterm elections if young people turn out to vote, a result that campaigns and political action committees are spending big money to produce. One measure of whether they are succeeding is engagement. About half of young adults report following news about the midterms often or sometimes. About another quarter say they engage on social media. About a third say they’re certain to vote, with some others indicating they are more likely to vote than not.
If more young people turn out at the polls, it’s Democrats who are poised to benefit. Not only are young adults more likely to be Democrats, but young Democrats are also more likely than young Republicans to say they’re certain to vote, 40 percent to 27 percent. Roughly two-thirds of Democrats are engaging with news about the elections often or sometimes, and more Democrats than Republicans say they’re interested in the midterm elections. For many Democrats, this interest is derived from the 2016 presidential election: 54 percent say the outcome increased their interest in the 2018 midterm elections.
“I haven’t voted so much in the past, but I’m paying attention this year,” said Tyler Seulean, 26, a truck driver from Houston, Texas, who says he leans to the political left. He said he did not vote in the 2016 election but is following immigration and other issues related to Trump’s administration. “I’m older,” he adds. “It’s more important to me now.”
Another factor in whether this group will be motivated to vote is that they feel pessimistic about the political environment. Nearly 7 in 10 young adults think American politics have not been functioning well in the past month, and many think the country will become even more politically divided in the next few years.
Still, an overwhelming number share hope that the election will bring about change — and many think their generation will be the impetus.
On policy issues, young Americans connect what’s happening in the world with policies that are important to them. Immigration is the leading issue on the minds of young Americans, many of whom took the survey when migrant children were being separated from their families at the U.S.-Mexico border. Earlier this year, just after the shooting at a Florida high school that left 17 students and staff dead, the first Youth Political Pulse poll found about 2 in 10 young adults reported gun policy as the most concerning issue facing the nation, and that was more mentioned than any other issue.

There have been 1,442 children 5 and older reunified with their parents in U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody and 378 others who were released “in other appropriate circumstances,” including to other sponsors, the Justice Department said in a court filing.
Still, more than 700 parents were deemed not eligible or currently not eligible, many of whom may have been deported. Of those, 431 children have parents outside the United States.
More than 2,500 children were separated from their parents at the border in the past several months amid a zero tolerance policy that criminally prosecuted anyone caught crossing illegally.
Some children who had not seen their parents in weeks or months seemed slow to accept that they would not be abandoned again. One father who was reunited last week said his young daughter did not believe that he would not leave her a second time.
“I think that some of the children very quickly attach. Others, there’s a distance. There’s this caution, this lack of certitude, and part of it is not understanding what happened,” said Ruben Garcia, director of the Annunciation House, an immigrant-assistance center in El Paso that has received about 25 families each day this week.
Lee Gelernt, an attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union who represents the separated families, said before the latest figures were announced that the government should not be congratulating itself for meeting its “self-defined” deadline.

“The government shouldn’t be proud of the work they’re doing on reunification,” he said. “It should just be, ‘We created this cruel, inhumane policy … now we’re trying to fix it in every way we can and make these families whole.”
The Department of Homeland Security’s internal watchdog said it would review the separation of families, along with the conditions at Border Protection facilities where migrant children are held, in response to scores of congressional requests to do so.
For the last two weeks, children have been arriving steadily at ICE locations in Texas, Arizona and New Mexico to be reunited with parents. Faith-based and other groups have provided meals, clothing, legal advice and plane and bus tickets. The families are generally released, and parents are typically given ankle-monitoring bracelets and court dates to appear before an immigration judge.
But confusion and fear lingers. Jose Dolores Munoz, 36, from El Salvador, was reunited with his 7-year-old daughter last Friday, nearly two months after they were separated. His daughter cries when he leaves the house because she thinks he’s not coming back.
“She is afraid,” Munoz said in Spanish. “Yesterday I left her crying, she is telling me, ‘You are not coming back. You are lying. You are leaving me.'”
U.S. District Judge Dana Sabraw in San Diego commended the government Tuesday for its recent efforts, calling it “a remarkable achievement.”
“It is the reality of a policy that was in place that resulted in large numbers of families being separated without forethought as to reunification and keeping track of people,” said Sabraw, an appointee of Republican President George W. Bush.
Lourdes de Leon, who turned herself in to immigration authorities, was deported to her native Guatemala on June 7 but her 6-year-old son, Leo, remained in the U.S.
De Leon said Guatemalan consular officials told her signing a deportation order would be the easiest way to reunite with Leo.

“He is in a shelter in New York,” de Leon said. “My baby already had his hearing with a judge who signed his deportation eight days ago. But I still do not know when they are going to return him to me.”
Immigration attorneys said they had advocates on the ground in Central America to help parents who were deported without their children. And Gelernt said the ACLU would go looking for all of the parents to determine whether they intentionally left without their children.
“I think it’s going to be really hard detective work,” he said. “And hopefully we’re going to find them.”
Both sides were due back in court Friday, when the judge was going to decide whether to ban deportations of families for seven days after they are reunified so that parents could have time to discuss their options.
Late last month, Sabraw ordered a nationwide halt to family separations, which President Donald Trump effectively did on his own June 20 following an international outcry. Sabraw issued a 14- day deadline to reunite children under 5 with their parents and 30 days for children 5 and older.
On Friday, family attorneys would begin turning their attention to those who weren’t reunited — parents who had a criminal record, parents who were no longer in the U.S. and children who were handed over to other sponsors, Gelernt said.

The testimonies were among more than 100 pages of personal declarations compiled by attorneys who have worked closely with detained parents who were directly affected by the Trump administration’s “zero tolerance” policy it rolled out in early May.
The declarations detail several examples in which parents were not given enough time to make sound decisions, including having “only a few minutes to decide whether or not to leave their children in the U.S.,” a decision that one lawyer’s declaration said has been done in a room of up to 50 other people.
The PBS NewsHour read through all of the declarations and pulled several takeaways from the latest filing that offer a look at what the ACLU called a “mess” in the ongoing fight to reunify families separated at the U.S.-Mexico border.
READ MORE: There’s no timeline for reuniting hundreds of families who remain separated. What happens now?
For several weeks now, the American Civil Liberties Union and the federal government have been providing updates to a federal judge in San Diego on the process of reuniting thousands of migrant families. At the core of the latest arguments between both parties is how long parents have after being reunited with their children to decide whether to leave the U.S.
Earlier this week, the administration argued for a shorter deadline — about 48 hours — by which parents must sign a document officially stating their decision. The government said 48 hours is sufficient to make this decision, adding that a longer waiting period would strain the amount of limited bed space at the government’s detention centers and cost taxpayers $319 per day for each detained family member.
The ACLU, however, argued in a filing for a longer waiting period after reunifications — seven days — before parents could be deported. That would allow parents “sufficient time to consult about what might be the most consequential decision of their lives.”
U.S. District Judge Dana Sabraw is expected to weigh in on the contested length of this waiting period in a hearing this Friday. Until then, the judge’s temporary halt on deportations appears to remain in place. And, meanwhile, the deadline to reunify hundreds of parents with children ages 5 to 17 is today.
“[This Guatemalan father] appears to understand very little of what is happening in his case and has expressed that he is very confused. … [immigration officials] asked him to sign a form that would allow his daughter to be released to family members in the United States. He has no idea what this paper said as he is completely illiterate, and the form was in English.”
— Attorney Aaron Reichlin-Melnick said a Guatemalan man has talked with his 8-year-old daughter three times since they were separated at the border. Reichlin-Melnick wrote that the man’s Spanish is “quite limited” and speaks Akatek, an indigenous language. The attorney also noted: “Although language was a barrier when talking to him, this father was extremely clear that he wishes to be reunited with his daughter,” adding that the man was confused that he may have signed a paper that gave up his reunification rights.
“I met with five fathers who had been placed on this so-called ‘relinquishment list,’ but who told me that they did not understand the implications of what they were signing. All of the five fathers wish to be reunited with their children.”
— Attorney Luis Cruz is one of several attorneys who said in their declarations that parents who had waived reunification “in fact do want their kids back,” ACLU said in its filing. Cruz also wrote that all five detained fathers said they were not able to read or write in either Spanish or English. One said the process of signing the form lasted fewer than four minutes, and that he was not given the opportunity to talk with a lawyer beforehand. Another father said the process lasted fewer than three minutes and “said that he felt sad and intimidated during the process,” Cruz wrote.
“The officials then gave [the father] a document in English (which he does not understand), and told him that the only way his daughter could stay in the United States was if he signed this document. He had no opportunity to review the document or ask any questions about it. He told me that he signed this document because he felt pressured to do so and because he felt like he had no other choice. This entire interaction lasted approximately one minute.”
— Attorney Sofia Reive’s declaration, among others, builds on the ACLU’s claim that “the evidence is overwhelming that parents have signed forms they did not understand,” and feel pressured to do so.
“[One mother] said that while in custody, government officers told her to sign a form, which they explained would lead her to be reunified with her son. … Only later did she learn that she had signed away her right to be reunified with her child. She said that she wants her son to be returned to her.”
— Attorney Charles Mwalimu wrote about a Honduran mother and her 16-year-old son who were separated at the border. The mother also could not read the form because “her Spanish literacy is minimal,” Mwalimu said.

“Critically, these parents were not clearly informed and did not actually understand that they could both continue to fight their asylum claims and be reunified with their children.”
— Attorney Kathryn E. Shepherd wrote about the 15 separated parents she personally interviewed, saying that the immigration officials gave incorrect information to parents about their reunification rights. Several parents told Shepherd that they didn’t apply for asylum or other protections because immigration officials said “they were not allowed to apply due to having had been deported from the United States in the past.”
“At the conclusion of our meeting, when I asked him why he was distrustful of me at first, he said something along the lines of since he and his son entered this country, they have been lied to, that he doesn’t know who is government and who isn’t, and now that he has his son back, he will not let his son go anywhere without him.”
Manoj Govindaiah, director of family detention services at the RAICES nonprofit group, wrote that many fathers “needed extended coaxing” and convincing that he wasn’t there to take their children away. One father asked for identification — bar card, business card, driver’s license — and was still not thoroughly convinced. That level of distrust has made legal counseling difficult with parents who are reunited with their children after weeks or months apart, Govindaiah said in his declaration. “One father could not comprehend anything I was saying. Any statement I made would elicit a response of ‘but my son and I can stay together, right?’”
“I have talked to my son three times while I have been detained. We have discussed whether we want to be reunified with each other, and we both agree that being together as a family is the most important thing for us. We do not wish to separate, and I do not want to be apart from him any longer.”
— A parent from Honduras, identified as “H.G.A.” in a declaration, said they were separated from their 17-year-old son when the two turned themselves in to border patrol agents after crossing the border. In three separate instances, immigration officials said the parent needed to sign a form, but they refused to sign it because of vision problems, not being allowed to consult with their son and “because I did not trust the officials,” the parent wrote, “I do not know if they were reading the form accurately to me.”
“Trauma and lack of trust have created additional impediments to providing legal assistance. Mothers state that they have been lied to, coerced, and threatened while in government custody. Daily, mothers receive new disclosures from their children regarding their experiences in government shelters throughout the country. Children have expressed being deprived food, experiencing physical violence, and suffering ongoing depression during their separation from their parents. Some parents state they did not recognize their child upon reunification, because their child lost so much weight.”
Attorney Shalyn Fluharty said much more time is needed to counsel detained parents and their children effectively because of the trauma they face. Legal conversations over separation “have proven unbearable” for many of the parents at the South Texas Family Residential Center in Dilley, Texas, where Fluharty provides pro-bono legal counseling. “Even benign questions — like the question asking mothers to list the names and locations of their children on our intake form — produce tears and paralysis,” Fluharty wrote.

Where do things stand?,"Today is the deadline for the Trump administration to reunify separated minors between the ages of 5 and 17 with their parents.
Federal officials said in court Tuesday that the government has successfully reunited 1,012 migrant parents with their children. It has not yet reunified the 600 other eligible children in this age group and did not offer details on the other 914 minors who have been deemed ineligible for reunification.
The U.S. blew past a July 10 deadline to reunite children under age 5 with their parents. It said days later it had reunited all eligible children in that age group, but the statuses of the youngest migrants whose parents were deemed ineligible are not immediately clear.
In a closed-door meeting with Hispanic members of Congress on Wednesday, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen said the federal government was on track to meeting the court-ordered deadline. Her statement was reportedly “met with disbelief and anger” from the lawmakers, the Associated Press reported.
Here’s a look at the administration’s reunification efforts leading up to Thursday’s deadline, and what’s next for affected families.
According to the latest government update:
The government is aiming to reunite about 64 percent of the 2,551 separated minors older than 5 by Thursday, a goal it said it would meet. But the administration, when saying this, is focusing only on those “eligible” for reunification.
Amna Nawaz updates Judy Woodruff on the government’s progress in reuniting families separated at the border.
The administration did signal that a small amount of family reunifications may get delayed by other court orders or weather-related impediments, but that it was on track to meet the deadline.
U.S. District Judge Dana Sabraw, who has been requesting these consistent updates, called the administration’s efforts a “remarkable achievement.”
However, the judge has also been critical of the government in prior court updates, pointing to its “zero tolerance” policy rolled out in May that led to the thousands of family separations. This week he said the government gave no “forethought as to reunification and keeping track of people, and that’s the fallout we’re seeing.”
“There has to be an accounting,” the judge added. Sabraw was appointed by President George W. Bush.
ACLU attorney Lee Gelernt, too, has been critical of the administration’s reunification efforts, saying it’s focusing on “families who they are claiming unilaterally are eligible for reunification by the deadline.”
There federal government said there are 914 parents not eligible or not yet deemed eligible for reunification with their children. The U.S. said this group includes adults who have been identified as having a criminal convictions, among other reasons. Some of them were also deported.
The administration reported that as many as 463 parents are no longer in the U.S. According to a court filing this week, these cases remain “under review” to determine how many of these adults have already been deported or volunteered to be deported.
The government didn’t provide additional information about these parents’ circumstances, but did say it was reviewing each case individually.
On Tuesday, the administration said that 127 parents agreed to waive their right to reunification. In these cases, migrant parents may have felt that it was perhaps safer to leave their children in the U.S., rather than risk the harmful conditions back in their home country.
As the PBS NewsHour’s Amna Nawaz pointed out Tuesday, there were 12 parents in the first group of separated minors — under age 5 — who were deported without their children. “The government said they had a lot of trouble finding them and trying to reconnect them with their kids. You can’t imagine how they’re going to do that with 463 in this case,” Nawaz said.
Federal officials are expected to provide a complete list of deported parents to the ACLU before Thursday’s deadline.
Another notable number in this week’s court filings was that 900 of the parents have been issued a final order of removal from the country.
In a separate court filing Tuesday, the administration argued for a shorter waiting period for removals after reunifications occur. In that time, parents decide whether to seek asylum after they’re reunited with their children. In a court filing this week, the administration said it wants that window of time to last two days, while the ACLU argues for longer, at seven days.
According to court documents, the administration said “maintaining custody of certain aliens for a longer period than necessary to effectuate removal” impeded U.S. Immigration Customs and Enforcement’s ability to fully enforce the country’s immigration laws.
The filing said there is a limited amount of space to detain these families — about 2,500 to 2,700 beds in centers nationwide — and that a longer waiting period meant increased costs. The administration said it costs $319 a day to detain each person.
In a filing Wednesday, ACLU said seven days is needed to facilitate a “meaningful in-person opportunity to consult with their children and attorneys,” among other representatives to help decide “what might be the most consequential decision of their lives.”
The judge’s temporary halt on deportations will remain in place until a hearing on Friday to settle the disagreement both parties.
It’s not immediately clear what penalties the administration might face for missing the July 26 deadline. However, when the government missed the first court-imposed deadline of July 10 for reunifications, the judge was critical of the federal government’s efforts, but also pressed the administration to continue processing families.
For now, the focus seems to be on reuniting as many families as possible, and determining what to do for those deemed “ineligible” or otherwise remain separated. Remedies, if they happen, may come later.
Another status report is expected to be filed Thursday, and both the administration and the ACLU will meet again in court in San Diego on Friday.

But the plan has raised further questions about the reunification process, and whether the administration can meet a separate deadline later this month to reunite older children, age 5 to 17, with their families.
The latest plan, rolled out this week after being outlined to U.S. District Judge Dana Sabraw on Friday, comes after a confusing reunification process for the youngest migrants affected by the immigration policy changes. The government missed its July 10 deadline for reuniting children under 5 with their parents. Of the 103 children of tender age, 57 were reunited with their parents, with the rest deemed ineligible because investigations flagged adults for a criminal record or the parent was already deported, among other reasons.
The Trump administration has until July 26 to reunite the roughly 2,500 children older children who were separated from their parents under the “zero-tolerance” immigration policy established in May.

When asked Thursday about meeting that deadline to reunify the remaining separated minors, Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen, speaking at a security forum in Colorado, said “we will do our best, but we will not cut corners.”
The nine-page plan consisted of information the government put out in recent media calls and court filings. Here are some highlights:
The plan is an expanded version of a June 23 fact sheet put out by the administration, released shortly after President Donald Trump signed an executive order halting family separations stemming from the “zero tolerance” policy. But it comes weeks after the government said it would reunite families and also after the American Civil Liberties Union filed a lawsuit that led to the court-imposed deadlines for reunification.
Cmdr. Jonathan White, assistant secretary for HHS’ Preparedness and Response office, presented the agency’s updated reunification plan to the judge Friday. Judge Sabraw said White’s testimony and the updated plan provided “a great deal of comfort.”
“I also have the impression that you’re operating in absolute good faith,” the judge told White.

Democrats have long opposed financing Trump’s wall but lack the votes by themselves to block House approval of that amount. But they have the strength to derail legislation in the closely divided Senate. Without naming a figure, Trump said in April that he would “have no choice” but to force a government shutdown this fall if he doesn’t get the border security money he wants.
The $5 billion is well above the $1.6 billion in the Senate version of the bill, which would finance the Homeland Security Department. The higher amount matches what Trump has privately sought in conversations with Republican lawmakers, according to a GOP congressional aide. The aide wasn’t authorized to speak on the record about private discussions and spoke on condition of anonymity.
“Keeping Americans safe by protecting our homeland is a top priority,” Rep. Kevin Yoder, R-Kan., who chairs the House Appropriations Committee’s homeland security subcommittee, said in a written statement.
The panel released details of its bill the same day the House was set to debate a symbolic measure lauding Immigration and Customs Enforcement and belittling proposals to abolish it.
The GOP-written legislation is aimed at embarrassing and dividing Democrats, after a group of liberals introduced a bill last week erasing that federal agency. Liberals consider it an instrument of carrying out Trump’s severe immigration policies, including his now-abandoned separation of migrant children from their parents. But other Democrats think that bill went too far and risked alienating moderate voters.
The government’s new fiscal year begins Oct. 1, which in effect creates a deadline for the White House and Congress to try reaching budget deals. They almost never do. Without at least a temporary truce, federal agencies would shut down that day — which would create a tremendous political risk for the GOP, which controls government, barely a month before elections for control of Congress.
Trump made the wall a keystone of his successful 2016 election campaign, but insisted that Mexico would pay for it. Mexico has always refused to do so.
All but $126 million of the $5 billion would be for constructing more than 200 miles of wall, with the remainder for border technology. Beyond the $5 billion, the bill provides added money for expenditures including new canine teams, border patrol agents, new aircraft and sensors."
https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/trumps-remarks-about-changing-european-culture-draw-ire,migrant,905,2018-07-14T15:48:16-04:00,"Russell Contreras, Associated Press",Trump’s remarks about changing European culture draw ire,"WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump’s lament this week that immigration is “changing the culture” of Europe echoed rising anti-immigrant feelings on both sides of the Atlantic, where Europe and the United States are going through a demographic transformation that makes some of the white majority uncomfortable.
Historians and advocates immediately denounced Trump’s comments, saying such talk would encourage white nationalists.
“The way he put this argument about changing our culture … about Europe becoming less nice than it is, in other words, these people are here and they are making the culture crappy and making the place lesser, that’s straight out of the white supremacist/white nationalist playbook,” said Heidi Beirich, director of the Southern Poverty Law Center’s Intelligence Project.
Trump, in an interview with the British newspaper The Sun, blamed immigration for a changing culture in Europe: “I think allowing millions and millions of people to come into Europe is very, very sad. I think you are losing your culture. Look around. You go through certain areas that didn’t exist ten or 15 years ago.”
Trump, the grandson of a German immigrant and the son of a Scottish immigrant to the United States, repeated his contention at a news conference with British Prime Minister Theresa May:
“I just think it’s changing the culture. I think it’s a very negative thing for Europe. I think it’s very negative,” he said. “I think it’s very much hurt other parts of Europe. And I know it’s politically not necessarily correct to say that, but I’ll say it and I’ll say it loud. And I think they better watch themselves because you are changing culture, you are changing a lot of things.”
Beirich called those comments “racist.”
Claire M. Massey, a scholar at the Institute for British and North American Studies at Ernst-Moritz-Arndt Universität in Greifswald, Germany, said Trump’s comments were “awfully painful,” especially for the United Kingdom, where immigration has played a key role in rebuilding the country after World War II. “England and the United Kingdom wouldn’t be what it is today without immigrants,” she said.
Massey said Trump’s comments remind her of the rhetoric coming from neo-Nazis in Germany and Poland. The comments will embolden the far-right in Europe at a time when many European nations are already very diverse.
Lisbon, Portugal, for example, is now home to sizable and visible Brazilian, Cape Verdean, and Angolan populations. The immigrant groups and their Portuguese-born children have helped revitalize areas of the cities once in disrepair and have a presence in everything from professional soccer teams to popular culture.
Portuguese Mozambique-born fado singer Mariza is among the nation’s most beloved performers.
In France, immigrants from the Middle East and Africa have settled throughout Paris and have drawn the ire of the far-right and even some moderates over the city’s changing makeup. Then-French Prime Minister François Fillon decreed in 2011 that women were banned from wearing face veils outside of the home except in mosques or as car passengers. A European court later upheld the ban, saying the intent was to unify the country, but not before an outcry by human rights activists.
Throughout England, from London to Liverpool, immigrants from Asia, Africa, the Middle East and the former British colonies in the Caribbean have reshaped various neighborhoods, drawing scorn from members of the far-right and some rural residents who blamed the European Union and immigrants for the economic struggles of once-prosperous mining regions.
The United States is also going through a demographic shift. The Census Bureau estimates that the country’s population will have more minorities than whites for the first time in 2043, a change due in part to higher birth rates among Hispanics and a stagnating or declining birth rate among blacks, whites and Asians.
Trump’s public life has been filled with controversial statements about immigrants.
In the first moments of his presidential campaign in June 2015, he called for the construction of a border wall with Mexico and accused the country of sending migrants who were “bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.”
He continually used dark imagery to depict immigrants as dangerous invaders. Then, in the aftermath of a terrorist attack that December in San Bernardino, California, that was carried out by a U.S.-born Muslim and his Pakistani wife, who was a legal U.S. resident, Trump called for barring all Muslims from entering the country. The Supreme Court eventually upheld his executive order banning travel from several mostly Muslim countries, rejecting challenges that it discriminated against Muslims or exceeded his authority.
In January, Trump questioned why the U.S. would accept more immigrants from Haiti and “shithole countries” in Africa as he rejected a bipartisan immigration deal, according to one participant and people briefed on the conversation.
In recent weeks, Trump bowed to tremendous political pressure and issued an executive order ending his administration’s practice of separating migrant children from their parents when families cross the border with Mexico illegally.
Paul A. Kramer, a Vanderbilt University historian who specializes in the politics of inequality in the United States, said Trump’s most recent comments were an intentional attempt to ally himself and his base in the United States with the far-right nationalist movements in Europe.
“The rising tide of white nationalism is something that he embraces, that he sees himself as participating in and that he wants to encourage,” Kramer said.

A statement from the presidency says he called for “a permanent alternative that prioritizes the well-being and rights of minors.”
It adds that the president expressed concern over a recent attack on a 92-year-old Mexican man legally residing in California. The man was reportedly beaten by a woman with a brick and told “go back to your country.”

Pena Nieto said such incidents “encourage a climate of hate and racism that we must avoid.”
He also emphasized his government’s willingness to continue renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement with a goal of reaching a deal “as quickly as possible.”
The president met Friday at his official residence with the delegation, which also included President Donald Trump’s son-in-law and White House adviser Jared Kushner, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin (mih-NOO’-shin) and Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen."
https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/judge-puts-blame-on-trump-congress-for-immigration-crisis,migrant,967,2018-07-10T18:49:36-04:00,"Brian Melley, Associated Press","Judge puts blame on Trump, Congress for immigration crisis","LOS ANGELES (AP) — The Trump administration’s failed attempt to detain migrant families together indefinitely ran into a formidable obstacle in a judge whose upbringing was shaped as the daughter of immigrants and who previously rejected requests to allow the government to lock up children with their parents.
Judge Dolly Gee, the first Chinese-American woman appointed to the U.S. District Court, has joked that her mother was her first pro bono client because she had to translate for her at medical appointments and help her apply for jobs as a seamstress when she was just a girl.
“She in many ways inspired my desire to go to law school,” Gee said in a video produced by the National Asian Pacific American Bar Association. “I saw firsthand the difficulties she encountered as a non-English speaker and also as a garment worker. And I saw many of the abuses that take place in the workplace, and I decided at a fairly early age that I wanted to do some type of work that would address some of the inequities I saw as a child.”
On Monday, Gee rejected the Trump administration’s efforts to detain immigrant families in long-term facilities, calling it a “cynical attempt” to undo a longstanding court settlement.
The U.S. Justice Department said it disagreed with the ruling and was reviewing it further.
Gee, 59, worked for years as a labor lawyer and arbitrator before applying to be a judge in what she saw as a chance to diversify the court.
President Bill Clinton nominated her in 1999, but the GOP-controlled Senate dragged its feet and Gee never received a hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee. President Barack Obama nominated her a decade later, and she was confirmed and took her seat in Los Angeles in 2010.
Although Gee has handled hundreds of cases, she is best known for a series of decisions on immigration in which she has often ruled against the government.

Overseeing a longstanding settlement between the government and immigration advocates over the detention of minors, Gee ruled in 2015 that immigrant children should not be held for long periods — generally no longer than 20 days — even with their parents. She said they should be released as quickly as possible, typically to a relative.
In sharply worded rulings in the case, Gee scolded the Obama administration for holding children in “widespread and deplorable conditions,” and she dismissed a request to reconsider a decision at one point, noting the government had “reheated and repackaged” its arguments. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals largely upheld her ruling but said its agreement didn’t require the release of parents with their children.
Last month, Attorney General Jeff Sessions asked Gee to modify her order so families that entered the country illegally could be held together indefinitely. The move followed the president’s reversal of a policy that created an uproar when children were taken from their parents in emotional scenes caught on camera.
The government said in court papers that Gee’s previous ruling made family detention unlikely and provided an incentive for immigrants to bring children with the expectation they wouldn’t be locked up.
“One reason those families ‘decide to make the dangerous journey to illegally enter the United States is that they expect to be released from custody,'” the government said, quoting an official with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
Gee described the government’s request as a “cynical attempt” to foist responsibility on her for the president’s “ill-considered” action and Congress’ failure to address the issue for over 20 years. She said it was “procedurally improper and wholly without merit.”
Gee made a landmark ruling in another case in 2013 that gave mentally disabled immigrants the right to legal representation if they were detained and facing deportation. It was the first time a court required legal assistance for any group, including children, in immigration courts.
And during the early days of President Donald Trump’s travel ban targeting Muslim-majority countries, Gee ordered the return of an Iranian man who was removed from the U.S. upon his arrival despite having a valid visa.
Jean Reisz, a law professor and co-director of the immigration law clinic at the University of Southern California, said what’s unusual about Gee’s rulings is that she’s waded into the thorny topic of immigration, where the government has broad authority.
“Her strong language was kind of a welcome reprieve in a climate where discretion’s largely left to the attorney general and not reviewed by the judiciary,” Reisz said. “Most judges weren’t taking those positions.”
Attorney Michael Steinberg, a lead lawyer on the case involving immigrants with mental disabilities, said Gee was careful, thoughtful and respectful but made her point clear, even when it was subtle.
Before she became a judge, Gee was known for her work fighting for underdogs. She investigated workplace and racial discrimination and sexual harassment and worked on behalf of labor unions, though she also represented employers in some cases.
“She has used her position as a prominent attorney in Los Angeles to promote racial tolerance and fight for justice for those who face discrimination,” former Sen. Barbara Boxer, a California Democrat, said in a statement after the Senate confirmed Gee.
Gee said she was often underestimated early in her career because she looked much younger than she was and stood only 4-foot-11 (150 centimeters).
Her first assignment as a law firm associate sent her to a butcher’s union hall where the president was a “huge guy” who towered over her.
“He said, ‘So you’re the lawyer?'” she recalled in the interview with the bar association, part of a series on prominent members. “I said, ‘I sure as hell am.”
Once they got down to business, she said his “perceptions melted away.”"

Hendry,5 important stories that have nothing to do with the Supreme Court fight,"It can be hard to keep up with the rush of news that comes out of Washington, D.C. The PBS NewsHour takes a moment every week to bring you important stories happening beyond the Beltway. Here’s what we’re reading now.

In 2014, a religious movement turned rebel group known as the Houthis seized control of Yemen’s capital, Sana’a.
The fighters were supported by Shiite Iran, which raised concern in neighboring Sunni-majority Saudi Arabia. So the Saudis launched a coalition of Arab countries with support from the United States to drive the Houthis out.
Today, more than three years later, war still “rains down from the sky,” as the coalition tries to wrestle control away from the Houthi fighters and what’s largely seen as a proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Iran continues without an end in sight.
Yet while the U.S-backed campaign “has brought the country to its knees,” it “hasn’t pushed back the Houthis,” said PBS NewsHour special correspondent Jane Ferguson, who smuggled herself across rebel lines to report on what has become the world’s worst humanitarian crisis. She found a country frustrated with America’s role in the conflict, malnourished children, tightly held checkpoints and neighborhoods marred by airstrikes, its buildings turned to rubble.
After a Saudi offensive last month, both sides are at a stalemate as the U.N. tries to broker peace talks between the groups. The U.N. is seeking a deal that would end fighting in key port city Hodeidah, according to Reuters, which officials hope “could lead to a wider solution.” [The PBS NewsHour]
Why it matters:“America’s help with that campaign has driven bitter resentment here,” Ferguson reported. Ports and shipping routes are blockaded, which at times has also cut off medical treatment. Twenty-two million people need humanitarian aid every day.
“Millions are on the brink of starvation, and the worst cholera outbreak in modern history rages on,” Ferguson reported.
Three years of war have worn Yemenis down, but they also believe America could end it quickly, according to Ferguson.
“Now the people are almost dead. Poverty, hunger, disease, death, injuries, and on top of all that, the warplanes are hitting us,” a man named Abu told Ferguson in a market. “Since America has the biggest position in the U.N., it should have pushed for political and economic resolutions to the conflict.”
2. Denmark cracks down on mainly Muslim immigrant communities

Back in March, Denmark’s government proposed 22 measures that largely focused on regulating life in “parallel societies” — in other words, the 25 designated “ghettos” full of immigrants throughout the country.
Denmark uses “ghetto” as an official designation reserved for communities with residents from non-Western countries. Prime Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen has said there are “cracks” or “holes” in Denmark’s map because of ghettos.
The Danish government says they are home to high rates of unemployment and a concentration of criminal activity. These neighborhoods are also heavily Muslim.
The proposals include: more severe punishment for crimes — vandalism and theft, among others — committed in any of the 25 ghettos; requiring children in these areas to attend daycare for at least 30 hours a week once they reach 1 year old; and giving authorities more power to monitor these communities.
Since March, most of the proposals have been agreed upon by a parliamentary majority, The New York Times reported, while more will be addressed by a vote later this year.
Danish leaders said these proposals are all part of an effort to integrate immigrants from non-Western backgrounds into the country’s homogeneous population. Critics, including immigrants in Denmark, have called the government’s move anti-immigrant. Idil Ahmed, an immigrant from Somalia at age 17, told NPR in March that she initially felt the environment to be welcoming in Denmark, but that has since changed.
“You must do this, you must do that,” she said of the proposals. “What they mean is: ‘Go home.'”

Why it matters:NPR noted in its March story that the most “surprising” part of Denmark’s plan was how it was supported by the country’s center-left Social Democrats.
“It’s part of a growing European trend that is particularly evident in Denmark: Social Democrats are taking a harder line on immigration as they try to win back working-class voters who have veered toward nationalism,” Sidsel Overgaard of NPR reported at the time.
Politicians have been hardening their stance on immigration in both the U.S. and other parts of Europe as well. More recently, the U.S. rolled out a “zero tolerance” policy that led to the thousands of family separations at the border. In June, Italy refused to let a rescue ship of hundreds of migrants on board dock at its port; Malta eventually took in the stranded ship, but pressed charges against the humanitarian group that assisted in their rescue.
In both instances, despite the political rhetoric on immigration, the numbers tell a different story: border crossings on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean are decreasing, the Associated Press reported.
“The numbers don’t support the hysteria,” Joel Millman, a spokesman for International Organization for Migration, told the AP. “Politicians know what moves voters, and this is extremely effective in moving voters,” he added.
After a dispute over fireworks, Devonte Ortiz, 19, was fatally shot by a neighbor outside an Austin, Texas, apartment complex during the early morning hours on the Fourth of July, police said.

Police responded to reports of a shooting around 1:26 a.m. last Wednesday, the Austin American-Statesman reported, citing police documents. Ortiz was found outside his apartment with a gunshot wound and died soon after at a nearby hospital.
The neighbor, Jason Roche, 41, initially told officers that he shot in self-defense. Roche told authorities that he had confronted Ortiz and his friends about not setting off fireworks earlier in the night. The shooting occurred when Roche confronted the group of friends a second time, armed with a handgun.
Cellphone footage of the deadly encounter, however, showed that Ortiz was “moving away from the firearm and not lunging toward it as stated by Roche,” an affidavit says. Ortiz was black; Roche is white.

Why it matters: The Austin shooting is yet another in a series of incidents where routine, mundane activities — barbecuing, selling water, napping, canvassing — have escalated to encounters with police officers and citizens, sometimes with fatal consequences.
Many on social media have flagged these encounters with the #LivingWhileBlack hashtag, with some of the victims last month calling for a congressional hearing on the issue.
Public officials have also been subjected to such encounters, ranging from awkward to deadly, that seem to be underlined by racial bias. Janelle Bynum, an Oregon state representative, was approached by police last week while she was canvassing her constituents in a neighborhood. Someone had called the police to report she appeared “to be casing the neighborhood while on her phone.”
“It was just bizarre,” Bynum told OregonLive shortly after the incident. “It boils down to people not knowing their neighbors and people having a sense of fear in their neighborhoods, which is kind of my job to help eradicate. But at the end of the day, it’s important for people to feel like they can talk to each other to help minimize misunderstandings,” she added.

In the summer of 2016, fear about the Zika virus ran high across the Americas. For instance, “Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands and American Samoa saw more than 36,000 cases of locally transmitted Zika virus,” the PBS NewsHour’s Amanda Grennell reported. By the next year, though, that number dropped to 665.
What happened?
The full story remains untold, but Zika’s sharp decline was likely due, in part, to herd immunity. Herd immunity happens when enough people become immune to a virus, whether through vaccination or natural immunity from catching the disease. As a result, the virus can’t easily travel from person to person.
To stage a comeback, Zika virus would need to either mutate dramatically, which is unlikely, or find a new population lacking herd immunity.
What should you know about this summer? Grennell compiled a guide here. [The PBS NewsHour]
Why it matters: “The virus has killed only 20 people in the Americas since 2015,” Grennell writes. “But the virus can have devastating effects on the developing brain of a growing fetus, particularly through microcephaly, a birth defect in which babies are born with an unusually small head.”
There’s still a lot we don’t know about Zika. But researchers are continuing to make discoveries. One study published in Nature Medicine last week found that “Zika causes miscarriages and stillbirths in a quarter of pregnancies in non-human primates,” Grennell reported.
Biologists also reported the most detailed structure of the Zika virus to date, a finding that could “give scientists more tools to figure out how the virus infects cells,” which in turn can help develop vaccines.
More importantly: Will the virus come back?
Definitely, one expert told Grennell. “The question is when.”

Novo Dia, one of the largest processing companies for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, the federal program formerly called food stamps, announced that it would end its program that processes transactions at farmers markets at the end of the month, “leaving about 1,700 of the more than 7,000 markets that offer SNAP … with no way to serve low-income customers,” the Washington Post reported.
Under the Obama administration, the USDA made a push in 2012 to help farmers markets accept SNAP benefits.The department began providing mobile processing equipment, which today allows more than 2,500 farmers markets across the country to run SNAP benefit cards, which work like credit cards connected to SNAP processing agencies, the Post reports. Now $22.4 million in benefits are redeemed at farmers markets each year — an increase of 35 percent since the program began, the Post says.
But markets still need software to process the payments — that’s the service Novo Dia and other companies provide. Novo Dia services about 40 percent of the market, the Post reported, but the company said it could no longer remain competitive while still complying with the additional regulations and security measures a federal program like SNAP demands of vendors.
“It’s devastating,” Wholesome Wave CEO Michel Nischan told the Washington Post. His group is one of the nonprofits that match SNAP benefits used at farmers markets. The markets may serve areas where they are the only places to buy fresh food, and Nischan says “they only exist because patrons can use SNAP or incentives.” [The Washington Post]
Why it matters Novo Dia is only the latest issue with SNAP’s use at farmers markets. There have been problems with the firm now in charge of processing equipment, the Post reported — there are hundreds of markets waiting months for the equipment they need to participate in the SNAP program.
Over the years, there have been plenty of fights over SNAP, which serves about 42 million people, including the latest battle in Congress over whether to attach benefits to work requirements.
Yet “in the divisive debate over food assistance, the success of SNAP at farmers markets has been one of the few issues that Washington lawmakers agree on,” advocates told the Post. Both the House and Senate have included more funding for The Food Insecurity Nutrition Incentive (FINI), the grant program focused on increasing the number of SNAP recipients who buy fresh produce, largely because studies have shown that more people buy fresh produce and other healthy food when they can use SNAP benefits at markets. This is especially true in food deserts, areas where supermarkets with fresh food are few and far between.
At the moment, it’s not clear what long-term impact Novo Dia’s decision will have on SNAP’s availability at farmers markets."
https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/deadline-to-reunite-immigrant-families-rapidly-approaching,migrant,1047,2018-07-06T11:36:21-04:00,"Colleen Long, Associated Press",Deadline to reunite immigrant families rapidly approaching,"WASHINGTON — This spring, the Trump administration began a “zero tolerance” policy to criminally prosecute anyone caught crossing the border illegally. Because children can’t be in jail with their parents, more than 2,300 families caught by Border Patrol were separated. The move prompted mass outrage in the United States and internationally. After first blaming the practice on the Democrats, Trump on June 20 signed an executive order that stopped the separation of families. A June 26 court order by a federal judge set a hard deadline to reunite the families, and that deadline is fast approaching.
Here’s where things stand:
THE NUMBERS
It’s still not clear how many children have been separated from families under the zero-tolerance policy, or how many remain separated. Trump administration officials have said 2,342 children were separated from 2,206 parents between May 5 through June 9. Trump’s order stopped separations on June 20.
About 520 children were reunited with their families within days because the improper-entry prosecutions were finished before the minors were turned over to the custody of Health and Human Services, which is responsible for caring for unaccompanied children. HHS Secretary Alex Azar told a congressional committee on June 26 there were 2,047 such children in his agency’s care.
On Thursday, he said there are somewhere “under 3,000” children who were believed to have been separated, but that includes kids who may have lost parents along the journey, not just parents who were detained at the border. He said none had been transferred to Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody yet.
REUNITING FAMILIES
A federal judge in San Diego who had been hearing the case of a woman separated from her child ruled on June 26 that the families must be reunited within 30 days of his order, and by July 10 if the children are younger than 5.
But it’s still not clear yet how that will work. Homeland Security has set up a staging area at the Port Isabel detention center in Texas where the parents can be detained until their children arrive. But it’s not clear where they will go afterward — the three operational family detention centers are near capacity.
It’s also possible not all parents will be reunited with their children; HHS has a strict set of guidelines the agency must follow to determine a suitable sponsor, including a home visit and a criminal background check.

Health and Human Services deployed more than 200 workers to review the cases of separated children. Azar said parents and children are being swabbed for DNA to match paternity and checks are being done as rapidly as possible to make the court deadline. He suggested the children would be transferred to ICE custody at Port Isabel shortly before the deadline. But he signaled they’d ask a judge for more time.
Azar said about 100 of the separated children are younger than 5 and subject to the rapidly approaching July 10 deadline. Officials there say they know the locations of all the children — some were sent hundreds of miles away to shelters around the country operated by nonprofits that care for them until a parent or other sponsor is identified.
A court hearing was scheduled Friday.
FAMILY DETENTION
It’s also unclear if the families, once reunited, will be detained together or released on bond to wait out their cases. Trump administration officials have signaled they want to detain families indefinitely if they cross the border illegally, regardless of whether they are claiming asylum, in part because they say the cases move much quicker. But a court agreement on how children are treated in immigration custody generally prevents the government from holding children in detention longer than 20 days.
Justice Department officials have asked that the agreement, known as the Flores agreement, be modified to allow for longer detentions. Homeland Security requested up to 12,000 more beds for a family detention center at a military base, though it asked for 2,000 to be made available quickly and the rest as needed.
The facilities would have to comply with the standards set by the agreement that governs how children are treated in custody, which include access to medical care, entertainment, counseling and air conditioning; though many who have been detained say the accommodations still feel like prison. Congress would have to approve funding to operate the facility.
ASYLUM
Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who oversees immigration courts, has narrowed the parameters for those seeking asylum, arguing that domestic violence or gang violence is not grounds to grant it — a blow to people arriving from Central American countries like El Salvador that have been ravaged by violent street gangs.
Despite the limits, Homeland Security officials say if someone comes to a port of entry legally and claims asylum, then they won’t face criminal prosecution for improper entry. They generally aren’t detained while their cases are heard. Administration officials say only about 20 percent of asylum claims are granted, though people often spend years exhausting appeals before they are deported.
Some asylum seekers have been turned away at border crossings. Administration officials said it was a temporary measure only to free up space in processing centers. They say that the migrants were told to come back and that it was not an effort to push them into illegally crossing between borders, where they would be more likely to be detained and face criminal prosecution.
ZERO TOLERNACE
Meanwhile, the zero-tolerance policy remains in effect for those who illegally cross the border alone: About half of the illegal crossings are single adults.
The charge of improper entry is a misdemeanor and the practice is usually for those caught to plead guilty and be sentenced to time served, or a brief jail sentence.
Right now, adults who arrive with children are no longer being referred for prosecution because there is not enough space to detain families together. It’s unclear if or whether families will again face criminal prosecution should space become available.

https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/trump-administration-says-it-will-start-reuniting-families-separated-at-the-border,migrant,810,2018-07-05T15:37:49-04:00,"Ricardo Alonso-Zaldivar, Associated Press",Trump administration says it will start reuniting families separated at the border,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Stung by a public outcry, the Trump administration said Thursday it will meet court-ordered deadlines for reuniting families separated at the border, even as the politics of immigration remained at a boil.
Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar told reporters that his department is ready to reunite children in its care with their parents, starting next Tuesday with those under age 5.
However, Azar warned that entire families may remain in the custody of immigration authorities for extended periods, even those who are claiming asylum. Before the Trump administration’s “zero tolerance” policy, migrants seeking asylum under U.S. laws were often granted temporary release as their cases were resolved.
Azar also used a new and much higher number for migrant kids separated from their parents, “under 3,000” as compared with the figure of 2,047 he provided at a Senate hearing last week. Of those, about 100 are under five years old.
He said the new number reflected a more thorough look by HHS at its case files, and over a longer time period, to comply with the court order that families be reunited. That order had been issued after his Senate testimony.
Nonetheless, Azar’s effort to provide a more accurate accounting only seemed to create more confusion.
HHS has long been charged with caring for unaccompanied minors crossing the border. Usually, the agency places children with a U.S. relative or foster family while their immigration cases are decided. This year, HHS also took on the role of caring for children separated from their parents as a consequence of the Trump administration’s “zero tolerance” policy.
READ MORE: Government finally confirms that child separations due to ‘zero tolerance’ policy have ended
Azar said the new number reflects a case-by-case audit of about 11,800 migrant children in its care, over a longer time frame. About 80 percent of those children arrived unaccompanied at the border, and many are teenage boys.
Azar said the audit was done to make sure the agency was in full compliance with a court order issued after he had testified in the Senate, giving the lower number.
U.S. District Judge Dana Sabraw in San Diego has ordered the youngest children reunited by Tuesday of next week, and the rest before the end this month. A court hearing on the administration’s efforts and plans is scheduled for tomorrow.
Azar called the deadlines “extreme” but said HHS will comply after an extensive effort to identify children in its shelters who were separated from their parents, to confirm parentage, and to screen parents for criminal violations or other problems that could result in harm to kids.
“While I know there has been talk of confusion, any confusion is due to a breakdown in our immigration system and court orders. It’s not here,” Azar said, adding that migrant children are being well cared for in HHS facilities.
Once HHS reunifies the families, they will be in the custody of the Department of Homeland Security, Azar said. DHS has already started moving some parents to facilities closer to facilities where their children are being kept.
Azar said his department has more than 230 people working on just trying to match children with their parents. DNA testing is being used to speed up the matches, because it’s faster than verifying paper documentation.
Congress must pass smart, fast and reasonable Immigration Laws now. Law Enforcement at the Border is doing a great job, but the laws they are forced to work with are insane. When people, with or without children, enter our Country, they must be told to leave without our……..
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 5, 2018
Shortly before Azar spoke, President Donald Trump took to Twitter, showing no signs of backing away from “zero tolerance.”
Only recently, the president had told Republicans in Congress to stop wasting their time on immigration until after November’s elections, but now Trump is insisting that Congress “FIX OUR INSANE IMMIGRATION LAWS NOW!”
He called current immigration laws “insane,” saying that “Congress must pass smart, fast and reasonable Immigration Laws now.”
The tweets seemed to carry an ominous message for border crossers.

“When people, with or without children, enter our Country, they must be told to leave without our…Country being forced to endure a long and costly trial,” Trump wrote. “Tell the people “OUT,” and they must leave, just as they would if they were standing on your front lawn.”
Congress has been unable to advance immigration legislation going back to the George W. Bush years. Republicans are divided among hardliners and business-oriented moderates who don’t see rising immigration as a threat. Democrats are pushing for a path to citizenship for people living in the country illegally, which many Republicans deride as “amnesty.”

https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/attorneys-say-parents-in-fragile-state-for-asylum-interviews,migrant,1008,2018-07-04T14:43:39-04:00,"Elliot Spagat, Associated Press",Attorneys say parents in fragile state for asylum interviews,"LOS FRESNOS, Texas — Gabriel Canas, a bus driver from El Salvador who fled his homeland after members of MS-13 stormed his bus, did an initial screening interview for asylum under the worst circumstances.
He hadn’t spoken to his 9-year-old daughter since the Border Patrol separated them two weeks earlier. And in that time, he had been moved repeatedly from one detention facility to another.
“The day I had my interview, I wasn’t well because they’d taken my daughter away. I was worried sick. I didn’t know where she was. I hadn’t spoken to her,” Canas told a judge at the Port Isabel Detention Center in Texas, where parents of many of the more than 2,000 children who were separated under the Trump administration’s “zero tolerance” policy await their fate.
His case illustrates an overlooked effect of the separations: Some immigrants complain that they stumbled through their first asylum interviews when they were deeply distraught over losing their children. The interviews can have life-changing consequences because they are critical to establishing why families cannot return home safely.
Not until a day after the interview did Canas learn through a lawyer what happened to his child. The asylum officer who conducted the interview issued a deportation order. On Monday, an immigration judge upheld it.
The judge cited new Justice Department guidelines that gang violence is not sufficient grounds for asylum. But Canas blames his poor interview and plans to seek another one.
Volunteer lawyers say parents are distressed about losing their children and having no firm date for when they will reunite, putting them at a big disadvantage when they meet with asylum officers from the Citizenship and Immigration Service.
The so-called credible-fear interviews at Port Isabel take place by phone within two to four weeks of a parent’s arrest and last 45 to 90 minutes each, according to immigration attorney Jodi Goodwin. Getting an answer can take a week.
To clear the initial hurdle, asylum seekers must demonstrate a “significant possibility” that they can prove that they have been persecuted or have a well-founded fear of persecution on grounds of race, religion, nationality, membership in a social group or political opinion if they are returned home.
They are judged partially on the consistency of their statements to border inspectors at the time of arrest. Attorneys say many asylum seekers, usually speaking through translators, fumble their interviews by holding back on details that may help their cases.
The risks of the interviews don’t trouble immigration hard-liners. Many of them see the asylum process as a joke, saying it invites fraud by migrants who exaggerate claims and exploit loopholes to get into the U.S. When legal groups talk about flubbed interviews or asylum seekers who need to be coached through the process, hard-liners see evidence that migrants are rehearsing from a script.

Harlingen immigration attorney Norma Sepulveda is representing a dozen parents detained at Port Isabel, including Canas.
“The first thing he said to the asylum officer was: Do you know where my daughter is?” said Sepulveda, who found the girl in Arizona after she was transferred there from Chicago.
After President Donald Trump ordered an end to the separations on June 20, border authorities generally stopped splitting up families for prosecution. But many at Port Isabel were arrested before Trump reversed course and are still separated. A federal judge in San Diego ruled last week that families must be reunited in 30 days, or 14 days if the children are younger than 5 years old.
Many of the parents have already been interviewed. Goodwin, who spearheads a network of volunteer lawyers, estimates that her attorneys had counseled about 210 separated parents at Port Isabel by the end of June. Most of them — about 150 — had already been through initial interviews.
Among those parents, more than half had talked to their children by phone. But they typically knew only that the children were in a government shelter and maybe the state or city where it was.
More than 3 out of 4 asylum seekers passed the screening from October to January, according to the latest published statistics. That approval rate may fall after Attorney General Jeff Sessions’ decision to declare that domestic and gang violence are generally not sufficient grounds for asylum.
In Canas’ case, the immigration judge cited the June 11 order from Sessions.
“It’s not that I think that your fear is illegitimate,” Judge Morris Onyewuchi said. “But the cops I must follow have ruled that gang extortion, gang recruitment are not grounds for asylum.”
Citizenship and Immigration Services said it asks every asylum seeker if they feel comfortable proceeding and, if not, the interview is rescheduled.
“All applicants are asked about their health, to include their mental health and have the opportunity to discuss that issue as well as any issue that might impact their case with the interviewing officer. Our supervisors are directed to reschedule cases pending concerns that the applicant might have,” the agency said in a statement.
The advocacy group Kids in Need of Defense sent volunteer attorneys to Port Isabel this week with the goal of counseling parents before their initial screening.
“We are talking to people who are distraught because they don’t know where their children are and they’re facing a complex, potentially life-or-death interview,” said Wendy Young, president of the group. “To have to face a complicated legal proceeding when you’re so focused on the safety of your child, I can’t imagine what that feels like.”
Canas, who was separated from his daughter at the Texas border, hopes to be reunited with her and to join his legal-resident parents and U.S. citizen sister in the U.S. His chances are poor, Sepulveda said, but he will seek a fresh asylum review.
“The purpose of coming here was to save my life and my daughter’s life,” he said. “That’s all.”"

BERLIN — Chancellor Angela Merkel and her rebellious Bavarian allies searched Monday for a way to resolve a standoff over migration after Germany’s interior minister offered to resign, but a compromise looked elusive in the dispute that has rocked her government.
The crisis that has raised questions over the future of Merkel’s 3½-month-old government pits Interior Minister Horst Seehofer and his Bavaria-only Christian Social Union against Merkel, head of its longtime sister party, the Christian Democratic Union.
Ahead of a difficult Bavarian state election in October, the CSU is determined to show it is tough on migration. Seehofer wants to turn back at the border asylum-seekers who have already registered in another European Union country but Merkel is adamant that Germany shouldn’t take unilateral actions that affect other EU nations.
Seehofer and Merkel, who have long had a difficult relationship, have sparred over migrant policy on and off since 2015. However, the current dispute has erupted as Germany is seeing far fewer newcomers than in 2015.
Seehofer reportedly argues that measures to tackle migration agreed at a European Union summit last week aren’t enough. He offered his resignation at a meeting with leaders of his party Sunday night — though he put it on hold ahead of a meeting Monday in Berlin with the CDU leadership.
The leadership of Merkel’s party approved a resolution Sunday stating that “turning people back unilaterally would be the wrong signal to our European partners.”
It is unclear what effect Seehofer’s resignation as interior minister and CSU leader, if he goes through with it, would have on the alliance between the two conservative parties and their governing coalition with the center-left Social Democrats.
Over recent days, speculation had focused on the possibility that Merkel would fire Seehofer if he went ahead unilaterally with his plan. That would likely end the seven-decade partnership of the CDU and CSU, which have a joint parliamentary group, and would leave the government just short of a majority.
Seehofer made no comment to reporters as he arrived at Monday’s meeting in Berlin. But in comments to the Sueddeutsche Zeitung newspaper, he complained that he was in an “inconceivable” situation.
“I won’t let myself be fired by a chancellor who is only chancellor because of me,” he was quoted as saying in an apparent reference to the CSU’s traditionally strong election results in Bavaria.
CDU leaders and lawmakers earlier Monday stressed the importance of maintaining the conservative alliance, Germany’s strongest political force for much of its post-war history.
Merkel says a plan to regulate immigration that EU leaders approved Friday and bilateral agreements in principle that she hashed out with some countries for them to take back migrants would accomplish what Seehofer seeks.
However, the more conservative CSU believes its credibility is at stake as it tries to curb support for the rival anti-migration Alternative for Germany party in the Bavarian election.
European agreements “will take a very long time” to take effect and there are uncertainties over which countries will join, hard-line Bavarian governor Markus Soeder said.
“So I think action in Germany to strengthen European interests is absolutely necessary,” he said.
But he also struck a conciliatory tone, saying “there is an abundance of possibilities … for compromises,” without specifying what they were. He insisted the CSU doesn’t want to break up the conservative partnership.
“We can achieve a lot in a government, but not outside,” Soeder said.
The Social Democrats, who have largely been bystanders so far, demanded that their coalition partners get their act together, and called for a meeting later Monday with the conservative leaders. Party leader Andrea Nahles said “the CSU is on a dangerous ego trip that is paralyzing Germany and Europe.”
“The blame game between CDU and CSU must end, because it is irresponsible,” she said."

Lopez Obrador will begin a six-year term Dec. 1, and is constitutionally barred from seeking re-election.
After leading most opinion polls throughout the campaign, Lopez Obrador of the National Regeneration Movement easily defeated his two main rivals — conservative Ricardo Anaya of a right-left coalition and Jose Antonio Meade of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party. Independent candidate Jaime Rodriguez finished a distant fourth, in single digits.
MEXICO CITY — An exit poll gave an overwhelming lead to leftist populist candidate Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador in Mexico’s presidential election Sunday night, and one of his chief rivals conceded defeat shortly after polls closed nationwide.
The survey by Consulta Mitofsky said Lopez Obrador had a 16 to 26 percent lead over his nearest rival, conservative Ricardo Anaya.
The candidate said to be in third place, Jose Antonio Meade of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, acknowledged a Lopez Obrador victory in a televised speech.
“For the good of Mexico, I wish him the greatest success,” Meade said.

Lopez Obrador, better known as AMLO, has said he will transform Mexico if he wins this, his third bid for the presidency, vowing to overthrow the “mafia of power” he claims has looted the country and rule for the poor.
“There is a lot of inequality, a lot of violence in this country,” said Lopez Obrador voter Hugo Carlos, 73. “This situation has to be changed.”
Exit polls by Consulta Mitofsky also forecast clear gubernatorial wins for allies of Lopez Obrador’s Morena party in four of eight state races on the ballot plus for the head of government in Mexico City. The central highland state of Guanajuato was predicted to go to a candidate of the conservative National Action Party.
While Lopez Obrador, 64, held a commanding lead in polls heading into Sunday’s vote, he worried many who fear he could set the country back decades and lead to disaster with an interventionist economic policy.
“I am concerned that some candidates are making proposals that are impossible, because they’re very expensive to carry out,” said Juan Carlos Limas, 26, who lined up at a Mexico City precinct to vote for Ricardo Anaya, who is running second in polls for a right-left coalition.
Lopez Obrador, who cast his ballot early Sunday, has pledged to give scholarships or paid apprenticeships to youth, and increase support payments for the elderly.
All the candidates are lambasting President Donald Trump’s policies against migrants and Mexico, but voters were wondering who could best deal with Trump.
Sunday’s elections for posts at every level of government are Mexico’s largest ever and have become a referendum on corruption, graft and other tricks used to divert taxpayer money to officials’ pockets.
Some see this election as Lopez Obrador’s best shot at the presidency after 12 years of near-permanent campaigning with his anti-establishment message falling on receptive ears.
“The corrupt regime is coming to its end,” Lopez Obrador said at his final campaign event Wednesday. “We represent modernity forged from below.”

Much of the popular ire has been aimed at unpopular President Enrique Pena Nieto’s Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, whose market-oriented economic reforms have yet to benefit many Mexicans, and Meade struggled during the campaign to escape popular rejection of the party.
Anaya tried to harness the youth vote with an emphasis on technology and new ideas, but he divided his own conservative party to take its candidacy and it’s unclear if his new allies in the leftist Democratic Revolution Party will actually turn out for someone from the other end of the ideological spectrum.

Sunday was the first time that an independent candidate appears on the ballot.
Jaime “El Bronco” Rodriguez fought for attention with a horse-mounted “everyman” campaign and by tossing out policy bombs like his proposal to cut off the hands of public officials caught stealing. Without the big party machinery it was an uphill battle.
It is also the first time Mexicans living abroad can vote for down ballot races like senators. More than 181,000 received ballots and the 97,000 that the National Electoral Institute had gotten back by Friday morning were already double what they got in 2012.
Casting his own vote, Pena Nieto promised to work with whoever wins on the transition.
“The president of the republic and his government will be absolutely respectful and support the authorities that are elected,” Pena Nieto told reporters.
In both of Lopez Obrador’s previous two presidential losses he alleged fraud. In his first loss — by a mere 0.56 percent to conservative Felipe Calderon in 2006 — his supporters held months-long protests in Mexico City and he referred to himself as “the legitimate president.”

His allies warned even before Sunday’s presidential vote that there better not be any funny business.
Still, the voting was by and large peaceful, apart from the usual complaints about some volunteer-staffed polling places opening late.
The head of the country’s electoral institute, Lorenzo Cordova, said voting was proceeding “peacefully, without major incidents,” and that only four of the 156,807 polling places failed to open.
On Saturday, the Democratic Revolution party said four of its members were killed in Mexico State, west of Mexico City, while trying to prevent hand-outs of goods by the ruling party to potential voters.
The government of the northern state of Chihuahua reported that three people were arrested in the border city of Ciudad Juarez for allegedly trying to buy votes for an unnamed political party.
And in Michoacan state, polling places in a few villages were cancelled after some inhabitants said they didn’t want elections involving political parties, which they mistrust. Some ballots were stolen and burned in the town of Nahuatzen to prevent voting.
In the northwestern border city of Tijuana, 29-year-old engineer Jorge Serrano Martinez said he voted for Lopez Obrador because he wanted “to give the opportunity to another political party to do different things.”
“He is not linked to any act of corruption and he has a history as a social fighter,” Serrano said. “I think he is the least corrupt of all.”

Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York said Immigration and Customs Enforcement, known as ICE, has “become a deportation force.”
“You should get rid of it, start over, reimagine it and build something that actually works,” she told CNN late Thursday.
Her comments follow similar sentiments expressed by Sen. Kamala Harris of California over the past week. In interviews with multiple outlets, she has said the government “maybe” or “probably” should “start from scratch” on an immigration enforcement agency.

Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who sought the Democratic nomination in 2016 and is mulling another run, has stopped short of his colleagues’ calls to dismantle ICE. But he has also been quick to note his vote opposing the 2002 law that paved the way for ICE to replace the old Immigration and Naturalization Service following the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.
Housed within the Department of Homeland Security, ICE is in charge of executing hundreds of federal immigration statutes. The debate over the agency’s future follows the widespread outcry in recent weeks after the Trump administration separated more than 2,000 migrant children from their parents. Marches are scheduled across the country Saturday to protest the policy, which President Donald Trump later reversed.
The Democratic calls to scrap the agency underscore the balancing act the party is facing on immigration issues. Such rhetoric could prove unhelpful to the 10 Democratic senators seeking re-election this fall in states Trump carried in 2016, where conservative views on immigration prevail. But calling for an end to ICE could be a winner for Democrats seeking to rally the party’s base in the 2020 presidential primaries.
Many anti-Trump activists, who are driving the Twitter hashtag #abolishICE, have celebrated the moves by Gillibrand, Harris and others.
Nelini Stamp, the national organizing director for the Working Families Party, one of many progressive groups that ratcheted up its activity after Trump’s election, called it a “critical moment” in the early maneuverings for 2020.
“Any Democrats who want to be the nominee needs to stand on the right side of this,” Stamp said. “Even if they don’t say ‘abolish ICE,’ they can’t not address it.”
Angel Padilla, the political director at the grassroots group Indivisible, said ICE “terrorizes communities” and that Gillibrand’s move “demonstrates where the progressive base is.”
Still, not every immigrant advocacy group takes the same view.
Cristobal Alex, president of the Latino Victory Project, a political action group that backs pro-immigration candidates, rejected ICE as a “litmus test.” But he said it’s “heartening” that immigration policy in general “is at the forefront of the conversation ahead of 2020.”
Alex said his group has met privately with several potential presidential candidates.
Their focus, Alex said, should be on “stopping the long-standing culture of corruption” in U.S. immigration policy and “the appalling practices” of the Trump administration, not on a move that by itself “amounts to rebranding.”
Indeed, the would-be presidential candidates haven’t yet detailed what they propose in ICE’s place. Harris had introduced legislation before the border separation crisis that would curb the expansion of immigration detention centers. She and Gillibrand and others have at least hinted that they would want the Justice Department’s prosecutorial power less involved in border security.
Whatever the details, the focus on ICE could cause problems for some potential candidates with more conservative records on immigration.
Former Vice President Joe Biden voted as a senator from Delaware for the 2002 law — the Homeland Security Act — that paved the way for ICE to replace the Immigration and Naturalization Service. He also voted in 2006 for a Bush administration-backed border security measure. Biden, however, has been critical of Trump’s immigration policy as he considers a 2020 run. Earlier this year, Biden headlined a private event with the Latino Victory Project in Miami.
The activists pushing for ICE abolition, meanwhile, said they aren’t worried about potential blowback or any difficulties for Democrats facing more conservative voters, including those potentially swayed by Trump’s repeated charges that Democrats favor “open borders.”
At the Working Families Party, Stamp said she sees the activists taking a position that “offers space” to other Democrats activists know won’t agree with them. “We give them room to talk about better immigration policy,” she said, comparing the circumstances to the civil rights movement, when Martin Luther King Jr., was viewed more favorably by white power brokers than more strident leaders like Malcolm X.
“Martin Luther King never said, ‘Black power,'” Stamp said. “But having the left flank that did, made the right folks willing to at least talk to King.”"

Eighty-eight million registered voters — many of whom are fed up with corruption and inefficiency under the administration of current president Enrique Peña Nieto — will get the chance to change the face of Mexico’s government, and affect the course of U.S. relations, with major border and trade issues at stake.
Beyond the presidential race, more than 1600 elected positions at the state and local level are up for a vote across 30 of Mexico’s 32 states — including Mexico City’s mayor — as well as its entire federal legislative body: 500 seats in the legislature, and 128 in its senate.
But this politically seismic campaign cycle has been plagued by scandal and murder. Violence in local districts has reached unprecedented levels in the runup to the election, resulting in the assassination of 132 political figures since September, including nearly 50 candidates, according to one study.

Photo by REUTERS/Henry Romero/File
Mexico’s ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (or PRI) stands accused by independent election observers of using legal institutions to wield influence over the election; and the party reportedly considered hiring Cambridge Analytica, the now-defunct British firm that used private Facebook user data to aid the Trump campaign. Fake news about the election on social media platforms has been rampant.
Andrés Manuel López Obrador from the National Regeneration Movement (MORENA) party is the frontrunner by a wide margin. The other three top candidates are Ricardo Anaya from the conservative National Action Party (PAN), José Antonio Meade from the incumbent Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) and Jaime Rodriguez, who is running as an independent.
López Obrador has led in the polls for the last three months, making trade a cornerstone of his campaign platform by vowing to review the NorthAmerican Free Trade Agreement.
Renegotiating NAFTA — or perhaps pulling out — is also a policy priority of President Trump, who has called the pact “the worst trade deal ever made,” and has long targeted Mexico with his ire. He famously launched his bid by decrying the migrants coming across the border (“They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.”) He has insisted that Mexico pay for a border wall, a demand that has been repeatedly and firmly rejected. And the separation of thousands of migrant children from their parents at the Mexican border, the result of the Trump administration’s “zero tolerance” policy, has been called “cruel and inhumane” and a “violation of human rights” by Mexican foreign minister Luis Videgaray.

Like many American voters who supported Trump, many Mexican voters see López Obrador, or AMLO as he is known in Mexico, as a populist alternative to a government that’s failed them. AMLO also vows to reassess controversial reforms signed into law by Peña Nieto in 2014 that opened Mexican oil production to foreign and private investors by eliminating the monopoly held by the state-run energy companies. But those who oppose López Obrador worry his economic plans will negatively impact markets and the broader economy.
Polls put National Action Party — or “PAN” — candidate Ricardo Anaya in second place, although Jose Antonio Meade, the candidate from current ruling party PRI, has been closing the gap with Anaya.
Luis Estrada, founder of Mexican political communications company SPIN, said the lack of a solid second favorite could work in López Obrador’s favor.
“Since there’s not a clear second place, like any other recent elections in Mexico, there’s no coordination among voters on who would be [in] second place and who would they’d vote for strategically if they find out that their candidate was no longer competitive,” Estrada said.
Because the second place race is close, supporters of Meade and Anaya could be too split to mobilize around a single rival for López Obrador, lowering the chance that opponents of López Obrador could strategically vote him out, despite a wide margin.
Many Mexican citizens have expressed the need for change during this campaign season. Adrian Duhalt, a postdoctoral fellow in Mexico Energy Studies at the Baker Institute for Public Policy at Rice University, said López Obrador’s lead can be explained by citizens tired of the status quo.

“I think Mexicans are going to go to the vote on July 1 with corruption in mind, with inequality in mind, with the lack of opportunities for all in mind,” Duhalt said, who added that distrust of both the PAN and PRI could be an additional factor.
The PRI maintained control of the Mexican presidency for 71 years until 2000, when PAN candidate Vicente Fox defeated Francisco Labastida Ochoa. Twelve years later, voters elected a charismatic Peña Nieto, hopeful that his administration would stanch national corruption and violence.
Instead, corruption skyrocketed during his presidency. (Tourists can take bus tours of Mexico City’s “monuments of corruption.”) Approval ratings for Peña Nieto fell as low as 12 percent last year according to Mexican newspapers, exacerbated by the 2014 death of 43 students “disappeared” and killed at the hands of police and federal officers in Iguala.
Peña Nieto’s administration also failed to rein in violence. Since Mexico’s drug wars were launched by former president Felipe Calderon in 2007, the country has been riddled by persistent cartel bloodshed. 2017 was one of the deadliest years on record for Mexico, leaving more than 29,000 people dead. The death toll since the drug wars began has reached almost 250,000.
“People are sick of the cynicism of the political elite,” according to María Marván Laborde, a researcher at the Instituto de Investigaciones Jurídicas. “It’s not just the PRI….even though the candidate from the PAN has [made every] effort to say ‘I am anti-system and I will really offer a change,’ he hasn’t been able to really convince people that he’s honest in this offer.”
While most of the coverage has focused on the national elections, candidate murders are on the rise in six Mexican states. In Guerrero, Michoacán, Chihuahua, Pueblo, Oaxaca and Quintana Roo, the count is at 48 deaths, according to a detailed list by El Universal.
The Los Angeles Times reports that the killings could be part of widespread gang violence perpetrated to maintain control of territory and local government.
Duhalt said that because this is Mexico’s biggest election, he isn’t surprised that violence is erupting. He speculates that clashes between supporters of opposing candidates could be a cause of unrest.
Mexican columnist Jesus Silva-Herzog Marquez wrote in Reforma, a Mexico City newspaper, that “the mafias don’t need to assault the palace directly. They do not look to exercise power directly. They want power at their service, and to ensure this they send their messages of death.”
Meanwhile, the PRI reportedly considered a proposal from Cambridge Analytica to help them win the election, but turned it down after months of deliberation. In December, then- U.S. National Security Adviser Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster mentioned the Mexican presidential race as a site of Russian interference, a suggestion that some analysts have echoed, and specifically On behalf of López Obrador’s campaign. But many experts, as well as the Mexican and Russian governments, have denied the existence of any such activity.
In addition to sharing a 1,900-mile border with the U.S., Mexico is also its third largest trading partner, shipping 610,000 barrels of crude oil north per day. While leading candidate López Obrador says he’ll protect NAFTA and crack down on unfavorable trade practices, some believe his hardline stance could do more harm than good.

“If López Obrador becomes president on July 1, he will have kind of a reality check” when it comes to trade policies, Duhalt said. López Obrador would need to reconsider some of his far more insular energy trade practices — including plans to build more oil refineries in Mexico to decrease reliance on the U.S.– given how deep Mexico’s economic relationship with the United States is, Duhalt continued. U.S. trade with Mexico totaled an estimated $616.6 billion last year.
“He needs to realize that international trade is important for Mexico,” and that Mexico sends about 80 percent of its exports to the U.S., Duhalt said.
According to Reuters, Mexican companies are increasingly cautious about their investments, fearing López Obrador’s promises to reassess energy reforms, U.S. trade relations and a massive, billion-dollar airport construction project in Mexico City after the election.
Immigration tensions between Mexican and U.S. are likely to continue should López Obrador take office. Since his campaign kicked off, he’s been critical of President Trump’s immigration policies, calling the recent wave of family separation at the border “repressive, racist and inhumane.”
But Laborde said the relationship with President Trump hasn’t been a main focus of candidate platforms, though will become more of a concern once the election verdict is in, with NAFTA, immigration and national security — issues at the heart of Mexican stability and prosperity — topping the agenda.
“I don’t see any possibility to rebuild peace in Mexico without working very close with the United States,” said Laborde — a challenging dynamic given the recent strain."

Groups that pulled off massive women’s marches the past two years and other left-leaning rallies are throwing their weight behind migrant families Saturday. More than 600 marches could draw hundreds of thousands of people nationwide, from immigrant-friendly cities like Los Angeles and New York City to conservative Appalachia and Wyoming.
Though many are seasoned anti-Trump demonstrators, others are new to immigration activism, including parents who say they feel compelled to show up after heart-wrenching accounts of children forcibly taken from their families as they crossed the border illegally. In Portland, Oregon, for example, several stay-at-home moms are organizing their first rally while caring for young kids.
“I’m not a radical, and I’m not an activist,” said Kate Sharaf, a co-organizer in Portland’s event. “I just reached a point where I felt I had to do more.”
She and her co-organizers are undaunted after nearly 600 women wearing white and railing against the now-abandoned separation policy were arrested Thursday in Washington, D.C. With demonstrations emerging nationwide, immigrant advocacy groups say they’re thrilled — and surprised — to see the issue gaining traction among those not tied to immigration.
“Honestly, I am blown away. I have literally never seen Americans show up for immigrants like this,” said Jess Morales Rocketto, political director at the National Domestic Workers Alliance, which represents nannies, housekeepers and caregivers, many of whom are immigrants. “We just kept hearing over and over again, if it was my child, I would want someone to do something.”
Saturday’s rallies are getting funding and support from the American Civil Liberties Union, MoveOn.org, the National Domestic Workers Alliance and The Leadership Conference. But local organizers are shouldering on-the-ground planning, many of them women relying on informal networks established during worldwide women’s marches on Trump’s inauguration and its anniversary.
Tyler Houlton, a spokesman for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, welcomed interest in the immigration system and said only Congress has the power to change the law.
“We appreciate that these individuals have expressed an interest in and concern with the critical issue of securing our nation’s borders and enforcing our immigration laws,” Houlton said. “As we have indicated before, the department is disappointed and frustrated by our nation’s disastrous immigration laws and supports action.”
White House spokesman Hogan Gidley did not respond to a request for comment.
In Portland, Sharaf and other mothers are working to organize a march expected to attract 5,000 people — all while they change diapers, nurse babies and prepare snacks. They have marched for women’s rights but have never spearheaded a political rally.
Sharaf and three other women recently fired up their laptops and cellphones at her dining room table — one mother breastfeeding her son as she worked. A toddler wolfed down pasta in a high chair and two 5-year-olds and a 4-year-old careened around the house.
“I’m a mom, and I think everyone I know that I’ve talked to about this issue has had a very visceral reaction,” Sharaf said. “Because as moms, we know how important it is to be with your child and how critical attachment is to a child. It’s just heartbreaking for me to see.”
Sharaf and co-organizer Erin Conroy are coordinating their efforts with immigrant advocacy groups.
“This is not my wheelhouse,” Conroy said. “As far as I’m concerned, this is a national emergency that we all need to be focused on right now.”
That passion is heartening for the broader anti-Trump coalition, which hopes the weekend marches will attract people who have otherwise been on the sidelines, said David S. Meyer, a political science professor at the University of California, Irvine, who has authored books on U.S. political protest.
“There are people who have all kinds of other grievances or gripes with the Trump administration and they’re quite happy to use this one as the most productive and salient for the moment,” he said.
The groups planning the so-called Families Belong Together rallies have carefully framed them as peaceful and family-friendly — another draw for those looking to jump into their first protest, Meyer said.
That’s in contrast to the sit-in in the nation’s capital Thursday, where participants knew they might be arrested.
In El Paso, Texas, immigrant advocacy groups are partnering with religious leaders and women’s march organizers Saturday to try to shut down the bridge connecting El Paso and Ciudad Juarez, Mexico.
Immigration attorney Linda Rivas said groups have met with U.S. authorities, congressional representatives and other leaders to discuss an escalating immigration crackdown that they say began decades ago. But the family separation policy has been a watershed for attracting a broader spectrum of demonstrators, she said.
“To finally have people on board wanting to take action, marching, taking to the streets, it’s been motivating for us as advocates because we have to keep going,” Rivas said.
In Los Angeles, Angelica Salas said she has been marching to fix the immigration system for nearly two decades. The executive director of the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights said she would often tell people about how immigration enforcement was splitting up families and non-immigrants couldn’t believe it.
Now, she said, they do.

President Donald Trump spoke from Wisconsin today. Watch the president’s remarks in the player above.
But Trump’s celebration comes amid less-rosy economic news, with Harley-Davidson’s announcement it’s moving some motorcycle production overseas to avoid European Union tariffs that are a product of Trump’s escalating trade dispute with long-standing U.S. allies.
The president was irked by the Milwaukee-based company’s announcement this week and tweeted about it for three straight days, writing that any shift in production “will be the beginning of the end” for the iconic American manufacturer and even threatening retaliatory taxes.
Trump’s presence in Wisconsin was the subject of protests both in Milwaukee, where he spent a rare weeknight away from the White House, and in Mount Pleasant, where final preparations were under way for the groundbreaking.
Chants of “Hey, hey, Ho, ho. Donald Trump has got to go” were heard near the Pfister Hotel, where Trump overnighted and attended a pair of closed-door campaign events before heading to the groundbreaking and tour of an existing Foxconn facility. Gov. Scott Walker and House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., were among those joining the president at the fundraisers.
About 50 people walked from a downtown park to as close as they could get to the roped-off hotel, hoping Trump hears their calls to reunite migrant families separated at the U.S.-Mexico border after the president decide to prosecute everyone trying to enter the U.S. illegally.
As the president hobnobbed with supporters, his wife, Melania, was making her second trip in a week to the southern border to visit detention centers housing migrant children. She toured a Texas center last Thursday.
Christine Neumann-Ortiz, executive director of Voces de la Frontera, an immigrant rights organization, said the family separation issue is not unique to border communities. She said it’s also happening in the U.S. interior where deportations have increased.
“The scale of human rights violations that are being inflicted on children and families by the current administration should shake us to our core,” she said.
Protesters were also gathering near the Foxconn Technology Group campus in Mount Pleasant, about 30 miles south of Milwaukee.
Nearly 40 groups representing students, environmentalists, civil rights advocates, teachers, union workers and others have organized an event featuring dozens of speakers, a marching band, singers and musicians who plan to play ominous “Star Wars” music.
Foxconn is the world’s largest electronics contract manufacturer and assembles Apple iPhones and other products for tech companies. Based in Taiwan, it chose Wisconsin after being prodded by Trump and others, including Ryan, whose district will include the plant.
The project could employ up to 13,000 people, though opponents say it is costing Wisconsin taxpayers too much.
The ceremonial groundbreaking was supposed to be evidence that the manufacturing revival fueled by Trump’s “America First” policy is well underway. But Harley-Davidson’s announcement, spurred by the trans-Atlantic tariff fight, appears to have turned that on its head.
Walker is counting on a strong economy as part of his case for re-election in November. Wisconsin’s unemployment is at record-low levels and Walker argues that the Foxconn project, the largest economic development deal in state history, shows the state is on the right track.
When the deal, reached with assistance from the White House, was signed last year, Walker said critics could “suck lemons” and “all of us in the state should be smiling, Republican and Democrat, doesn’t matter.”
A year later, opinion polls show Wisconsin voters are split on the project and the state of the economy.
Trump carried Wisconsin by less than 1 point — just under 23,000 votes. He’s underwater in popularity, with only 44 percent of respondents in last week’s Marquette University Law School poll approving of the job he’s doing, while 50 percent disapproved.
Republicans were mostly unified in support of Foxconn, saying it is a once-a-generation opportunity to transform the state’s economy. But most Democrats — including all eight of those running against Walker — are against it, arguing the potential $4.5 billion in taxpayer subsidies was too rich. If paid out — they’re tied to jobs and investment benchmarks — the incentives would be the most paid to a foreign company in U.S. history.
Should Foxconn employ 13,000 workers as envisioned, it would be the largest private-sector employer in Wisconsin.
“Foxconn’s state-of-the-art products will be made in the U.S.A. — proudly in the state of Wisconsin!” Walker tweeted Tuesday, as he tried to shift the focus away from Harley-Davidson.

The first lady was expected to visit immigration centers Thursday housing migrants apprehended at the U.S.-Mexico border.
Mrs. Trump’s spokeswoman declined to immediately release details about her planned stops.
The visit comes a week after Mrs. Trump traveled to the border town of McAllen, Texas, to meet with officials there dealing with detained families. She also met with children at one of the facilities.
But that trip was overshadowed by a jacket the first lady wore to and from Texas that said on the back: “I really don’t care, do u?” The first lady’s spokeswoman said it was just a jacket, with no hidden message, but interest in her baffling fashion choice was a distraction from Mrs. Trump’s trip. Her husband, President Donald Trump, undercut the no-message message by tweeting that the white letters meant that Mrs. Trump doesn’t care about the “fake news” media.
This time, Mrs. Trump travels amid upheaval over her husband’s hard-line approach to immigration and evidence of increasing urgency over how that’s playing out.
More than 2,300 children have been separated from their parents at the border in recent weeks and some were placed in government-contracted shelters hundreds of miles away from their parents.
The president last week signed an executive order to halt the separation of families at the border, at least for a few weeks, but the order did not address the reunification of families already separated.
A federal judge on Tuesday ordered that thousands of migrant children and parents be reunited within 30 days — and sooner if the youngster is under 5. The order poses logistical problems for the administration, and it was unclear how it would meet the deadline."
https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/house-defeats-gop-immigration-bill,migrant,536,2018-06-27T14:05:58-04:00,"Alan Fram, Associated Press","House rejects Republican immigration bill, ignoring Trump","WASHINGTON — The Republican-led House rejected a far-ranging immigration bill on Wednesday despite its eleventh-hour endorsement by President Donald Trump, as the gulf between the GOP’s moderate and conservative wings proved too deep for leaders to avert an election-year display of division on the issue.
The vote was 301-121, with nearly half of Republicans opposing the measure. The depth of GOP opposition was an embarrassing showing for Trump and a rebuff of House GOP leaders, who’d postponed the vote twice and proposed changes in hopes of driving up the vote for a measure that seemed doomed from the start.
The tally also seemed to empower GOP conservatives on the fraught issue. Last week a more conservative package was defeated but 193 Republicans voted for it.
Even if it passed, it would have been dead on arrival in the closely divided Senate, where Democrats would have had enough votes to kill it.
GOP leaders have been talking about a Plan B: a bill focused narrowly on barring the government from wresting children from migrant families caught entering the country without authorization.
With television and social media awash with images and wails of young children torn from parents, many Republicans want to pass a narrower measure addressing those separations before Congress leaves at week’s end for its July 4 break.
But GOP aides said Republicans had yet to agree on bill language. And the effort was complicated by a federal judge who ordered that divided families be reunited with 30 days.
Democrats voted en masse against the House legislation, which would provide a shot at citizenship for hundreds of thousands of immigrants brought illegally to the U.S. as children.
It would provide $25 billion for Trump to build his coveted wall on the border with Mexico, restrict family-based immigration and bar the Homeland Security Department from taking migrant children from parents seized crossing into the country without authorization.
In a startling turnabout earlier Wednesday, Trump made a last-minute pitch for the bill. Last Friday, he urged Republicans to stop wasting time on the effort until after the November elections.
In his latest instance of whiplash on the issue, Trump tweeted, “HOUSE REPUBLICANS SHOULD PASS THE STRONG BUT FAIR IMMIGRATION BILL, KNOWN AS GOODLATTE II, IN THEIR AFTERNOON VOTE TODAY, EVEN THOUGH THE DEMS WON’T LET IT PASS IN THE SENATE.”
The tweet — which referenced Rep. Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., one of the bill’s sponsors — could well garner additional votes for a measure that was still expected to fail Wednesday. It was also the latest example of Trump’s erratic dealings with Congress. On Friday he dashed off a tweet, saying Republicans should “stop wasting their time on Immigration until after we elect more Senators and Congressmen/women in November.”
Trump had heard from House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., who urged him to publicly support the bill, said a person familiar with the conversation who wasn’t authorized to speak publicly. McCarthy, who is hoping to succeed Speaker Paul Ryan as speaker next year, and Trump have forged a close relationship.
Hours later, the White House sent a letter to lawmakers restating its support, saying the legislation would “support the administration’s goals” on immigration.

“The administration’s practice of separating families is cruel, plain and simple,” New Jersey Attorney General Gurbir Grewal said in a statement. “Every day, it seems like the administration is issuing new, contradictory policies and relying on new, contradictory justifications. But we can’t forget: The lives of real people hang in the balance.”
The states, all led by Democratic attorneys general, joined Washington, D.C., in filing the lawsuit in federal court in Seattle. Separately, immigration-rights activists asked a federal judge in Los Angeles to order that parents be released and immediately reunited with their children.
The Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for a comment on the multistate lawsuit. It had no comment on the Los Angeles filing.
More than 2,000 children have been separated from their parents in recent weeks and placed in government-contracted shelters — hundreds of miles away, in some cases — under a now-abandoned policy toward families caught illegally crossing the border.

Amid an international outcry, President Donald Trump last week issued an executive order to stop the separation of families and said parents and children will instead be detained together.
But precious few families have been reunited, and the Trump administration has disclosed almost no information on how the process will be carried out or how long it will take.
Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said Tuesday that his department still has custody of 2,047 immigrant children separated from their parents at the border. That is only six fewer children than the number in HHS custody as of last Wednesday.
Administration officials have been casting about for detention space for migrants, with the Pentagon drawing up plans to hold as many as 20,000 at U.S. military bases.
At the same time, the administration has asked the courts to let authorities detain families together for an extended period while their immigration cases are resolved. Under a 1997 court settlement, children must be released from detention as quickly as possible.
Outraged by the family separations, immigrant supporters have led protests in recent days in states such as Florida and Texas.
On Tuesday, police arrested 25 demonstrators at a rally ahead of a Los Angeles appearance by Attorney General Jeff Sessions. He was scheduled to address the conservative Criminal Justice Legal Foundation at a hotel later in the day.
Outside the U.S. attorney’s office, protesters carried signs reading, “Free the children!” and “Stop caging families.” Clergy members blocked the street by forming a human chain. They were handcuffed by police and led away.
Later, protesters gathered outside the hotel where Sessions was scheduled to speak. As the attorney general’s motorcade arrived, the crowd chanted, “Nazi, go home.”

https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/media-fight-access-restrictions-on-child-detention-centers,migrant,978,2018-06-26T07:12:11-04:00,"David Bauder, Associated Press",Media fight access restrictions on child detention centers,"NEW YORK — The children at the center of the national debate over President Donald Trump’s immigration policy have been heard about but rarely seen.
News organizations say they are pushing back every day against Trump administration restrictions on access to facilities where children separated from their parents are being held. Government handouts satisfy few, and there have been disputes raised in some of the few independent instances where a sense emerges of what is happening at the border.
“It’s not enough for the government to provide curated images,” said Noah Oppenheim, NBC News president. “The public expects and demands and has the right to see a verified picture of what is going on inside these detention centers and how this policy is being carried out in their name.”

After reporters were allowed to tour one Texas facility without cameras, the administration objected to descriptions of fenced-in enclosures as cages. A still photograph of a crying Honduran toddler whose mother was stopped crossing into the United States became a symbol to many of the since-reversed separation policy, in large part because other images were limited. The government revealed Friday that the girl and her mother were being held together.
Calls for access collide with a longstanding tradition of not allowing photographs of children in government care that the feds have applied to the immigrant children. The federal Health and Human Services department cites a 2015 policy that predates Trump’s presidency in prohibiting cameras, interviews with children or tours without two weeks’ notice. Their age leaves the children vulnerable to abuse, HHS said.
If the government wants to negotiate, there are ways to set ground rules to protect the interests of both sides. For instance, journalists are often embedded with military forces with the promise they won’t reveal strategy or troop movements that could put people at risk. CBS News is willing to negotiate, although standards editor Al Ortiz said Monday that CBS ran a story that showed some immigrant children being transported outside of campgrounds with some faces visible.
“Otherwise, we’d have a faceless story,” Ortiz said.
From the administration’s standpoint, the rule lowers the heat, communications experts say. Audio obtained by ProPublica of crying children at a federal facility was influential before Trump changed his policy — even though there were no visuals.
“In general, your goal is to demystify things, because every imagination could run wild if you allow it to,” said Joel Johnson, who worked in the Clinton White House and Capitol Hill and is now managing director of the Glover Park Group, which includes crisis counseling. “The fundamental question is whether what’s behind the curtain is worse than people imagine. If that’s the case, you don’t let people behind the curtain.”
Government communications officials want to control the message, and “sticking a camera in the face of toddlers is not a way to control the message,” said Erin Pelton, who worked at the White House and United Nations and is now managing director of the Washington firm Mercury.

On Monday, HHS officials led reporters on a tour of a government-run tent city for children in Tornillo, Texas on Monday. MSNBC pictures showed the tents behind large fences with no faces visible. The network ran government-provided video showing some of the accommodations, labeling it as such.
Mark Weber, top spokesman for the agency, said on Fox News Channel that it was an opportunity to let the public know the children are being taken care of.
“We’re not going to let them die in the desert,” he said.
HHS has released a series of similar photos and videos from various facilities. There are images of stacked-up laptops, beds with stuffed animals on the pillow, pictures of superheroes on the wall, breakfasts with scrambled eggs and cereal. Children are seen in neat lines and in what looks like government-issued clothing, but no faces are seen. Children are seen playing soccer, for instance, but camera shots are from the back or focused on the waist down.
Television network have shown some of the government-provided video in limited amounts, but labeled to let viewers know that the material was not gathered independently. Executives say they use the information reluctantly but that otherwise viewers would have no idea what is happening inside.
“If you tell the viewer, ‘This is from the government,’ I think the viewer is smart enough to say, ‘I wonder what else is there and I wonder what we haven’t seen,'” said Libby Leist, executive producer of NBC’s “Today” show.
The Associated Press has a policy of not distributing handout video without other elements in the story, given the sanitized portrayal provided by the government, said spokeswoman Lauren Easton. Because of newsworthiness, some government-issued still pictures were sent by the AP, the source made clear to users of the service.
The New York Times does not use the government-provided images because independent news photographers were not allowed in. While the newspaper has in the past used some handouts if they are newsworthy — the picture of former President Barack Obama and his aides waiting to see if the raid that killed Osama bin Laden was successful, for example — it does not want to set a precedent.
CBS’ Ortiz said the handouts also raise questions, noting that the children seen are boys. “There are no pictures of girls,” he said. “Where are they?”
Because of the restrictions, journalists are working harder than ever to find other material, like ProPublica did with its audio. Johnson believes the strategy of withholding access is doomed to fail.
Pelton agreed. “It’s inevitable that we will see more of what is happening and the more we see of the images, the more disturbing it will be for the audience,” she said."
https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/what-constitutional-rights-do-undocumented-immigrants-have,migrant,1588,2018-06-25T17:08:28-04:00,Gretchen Frazee,What constitutional rights do undocumented immigrants have?,"On Sunday, President Donald Trump tweeted that undocumented immigrants should be immediately returned “from where they came” with “no Judges or Court Cases.”
This, along with the administration’s “zero-tolerance” immigration policy and the recent spike in family separations at the border — a practice President Donald Trump ended through executive order — has called attention to the legal rights of immigrants under U.S. law.
What rights do undocumented immigrants have to a court hearing, to an attorney or to free speech? What rights do their children have to education?
To answer those questions, we must start with a more basic question–does the U.S. Constitution apply to undocumented immigrants?
“Yes, without question,” said Cristina Rodriguez, a professor at Yale Law School. “Most of the provisions of the Constitution apply on the basis of personhood and jurisdiction in the United States.”
Many parts of the Constitution use the term “people” or “person” rather than “citizen.” Rodriguez said those laws apply to everyone physically on U.S. soil, whether or not they are a citizen.
As a result, many of the basic rights, such as the freedom of religion and speech, the right to due process and equal protection under the law apply to citizens and noncitizens. How those rights play out in practice is more complex.
What the law says: The Fifth Amendment states that “no person … shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself, nor be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.”
The issue of due process is at the heart of many immigration cases, including Reno v. Flores, the 1993 Supreme Court case that has returned to the spotlight with the surge in family separations. The case led to an agreement requiring the government to release children to their parents, a relative or a licensed program within 20 days.
In the ruling, Justice Antonin Scalia wrote “it is well established that the Fifth Amendment entitles aliens to due process of law in deportation proceedings.”
How it works in practice: Immigrants have the right to due process. But in reality, says, Andrew Arthur, a resident fellow in law and policy at the conservative Center for Immigration Studies, “courts of law run the gamut.”
In some cases, immigrants are not granted a hearing at all. When asked about the president’s tweet, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders pointed to the process of “expedited removal,” which was created by the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996.
“Just because you don’t see a judge doesn’t mean you aren’t receiving due process,” Sanders said.
Under the expedited removal process, immigrants who have been in the country illegally for less than two years and are apprehended within 100 miles of the border can be deported almost immediately without going through a court hearing.
The exception is asylum seekers, who must be granted a hearing.
Those who are not processed through expedited removal have the right to due process in an immigration court, where the main goal is to decide whether a person has a legal claim to remain in the U.S.
“In immigration court, you have very few rights,” said John Gihon, an immigration attorney who spent six years as a prosecutor for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement before moving into private practice.
Gihon says the bar for what constitutes evidence is lax in immigration court. Documents do not have to be authenticated, and hearsay, a statement made by someone outside of the court, as opposed to on the witness stand, counts as admissible evidence. Hearsay is not allowed in most U.S. courts.
“In the majority of cases, it’s a lock solid 100 percent guaranteed conviction because there is little defense, and most would confess they crossed the border illegally,” Gihon said.
What the law says: The Sixth Amendment states that “In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall…have the assistance of counsel for his defense.”
The Supreme Court ruled in the 1963 case Gideon v Wainwright that if a person is too poor to hire an attorney, the government must appoint one.
How it works in practice: Because most deportation proceedings are civil rather than criminal cases, the right to legal counsel often doesn’t apply.
The Trump administration’s zero-tolerance policy now requires most illegal border crossings to be tried as criminal cases, the exception being parents who cross the border illegally with children. After public outcry about separating families, the head of Customs and Border Protection said Monday the agency has stopped referring parents for prosecution. Other immigrants will still be charged with a crime.
Under the law, anyone facing a criminal charge has the right to counsel. However, the government is only required to provide counsel if the person is accused of a felony. Crossing the border illegally is a misdemeanor.
In recent weeks, people have donated millions of dollars to nonprofit groups to pay for immigrants’ legal fees.
The Trump administration’s decision to criminally charge immigrants has overwhelmed the courts, as demonstrated last month by a leaked photo of a trial in Pecos, Texas.
The image shows dozens of men in orange jumpsuits being tried en masse. In such proceedings, reports the Intercept, which originally published the photo, trials can last only minutes per defendant.
What the law says: Critics of family separation have pointed to the legal right to “family integrity.” This right is not spelled out in the Constitution but was established through court rulings in the early 20th century, Rodriguez said.
“People have a right to be with and commune with their family. It’s a very basic principle,” she said.
The government can split up families in extraordinary circumstances, such as in the case of child abuse, but it cannot do so without going through a legal process.
How it works in practice: Before Trump signed the executive order Wednesday, the administration had divided families as a matter of course, without considering the individual cases. The ACLU sued, arguing the policy was unconstitutional.
The court has not issued a final ruling, and the president’s executive order could change the case. But a judge did rule earlier this month that the case could proceed, saying immigrants have a right to “familial association” under the Constitution.
What the law says: The Constitution does not prohibit anyone from voting. Instead, it spells out who cannot be denied the right to vote. The 14th Amendment says men who are U.S. citizens and over the age of 21 must be allowed to vote, unless they have committed a crime. The 15th Amendment prohibits anyone from denying the right to vote based on skin color and the 19th Amendment prohibits denying the right to vote based on sex (aka being a woman).
It wasn’t until 1926 that all states passed laws barring noncitizens from voting. Congress passed a law 70 years later prohibiting illegal immigrants from voting “for the office of President, Vice President, Presidential elector, Member of the Senate, Member of the House of Representatives, Delegate from the District of Columbia, or Resident Commissioner.”
How it works in practice: If you are not a U.S. citizen, voting in a federal election could land you in prison for up to three years or lead to deportation. States can impose their own, sometimes harsher, penalties for breaking the law.
However, because elections are largely a local affair, some states allow local governments to decide whether noncitizens can vote in local elections.
In fact, noncitizens in Chicago have been allowed to vote for school board since 1989. New Yorkers who were not citizens were given the same right from 1969 until 2003, when local school boards were abolished there. Now San Francisco and Maryland are also giving noncitizens the right to vote in some local elections.
What the law says: There is no “right to education” in the Constitution but two other sections do come into play when considering whether undocumented migrant children should have access to education.
First, in the case Plyler v. Doe, the Supreme Court ruled that if children who are citizens have access to a free, public education, so should undocumented immigrant children. That is because the 14th Amendment says the government cannot “deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.”
What it means in practice: The court case means undocumented children cannot be prohibited from enrolling in a public school.
But what if a child is being detained and, therefore, does not have access to a public school. That is where, once again, the Flores settlement comes into play.
The settlement requires that facilities where children are kept must meet minimum requirements for providing health care, education, recreation and other child care services.
What the law says: The Fourth Amendment establishes the right “against unreasonable searches and seizures.”
What it means in practice: While this law would generally apply to both citizens and noncitizens, there is a key caveat known as the “border search exception.”
This exception dates back to the very first Congress, which passed a law allowing searchers at the border as a means to collecting duties.
As a result, courts have long upheld that searches at the border are not considered “unreasonable” for the very fact that they occur at the border.
The question courts have grappled with since is what constitutes the border. Searches at airports and other ports of entry for example are often considered legal. The Justice Department has also established a 100-mile wide “extended border” where Border Patrol agents can conduct searches if they meet certain criteria."
https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/trump-tries-to-change-focus-of-border-debate,migrant,1080,2018-06-23T11:17:43-04:00,"Jonathan Lemire, Associated Press",Trump tries to change focus of border debate,"WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump tried to cast doubt Friday on wrenching tales of migrant children separated from their families at the border, dismissing “phony stories of sadness and grief” while asserting the real victims of the nation’s immigration crisis are Americans killed by those who cross the border unlawfully.
Bombarded with criticism condemning the family-separation situation as a national moment of shame, Trump came back firing, sometimes twisting facts and changing his story but nonetheless highlighting the genuine grief of families on the other side of the equation.
“You hear the other side, you never hear this side,” said Trump, standing with a dozen of what he calls the “angel families” who lost loved ones at the hands of people in the country illegally. He focused on the fact that young migrants separated from parents are likely to be reunited, unlike the victims of murders.
“These are the American citizens permanently separated from their loved ones. The word ‘permanently’ being the word that you have to think about. Permanently — they’re not separated for a day or two days, these are permanently separated because they were killed by criminal illegal aliens.”
Amid mushrooming bipartisan concern over depictions of terrified migrant children separated from their parents, Trump on Wednesday had abruptly reversed course and signed an executive order to overturn the policy, although up to 2,000 children are still believed to be separated from their parents. But that rare moment of public capitulation was brief from the president, who laced his remarks at a rally in Minnesota that night with hardline immigration rhetoric that continued Friday. In a tweet, the president raised questions about whether the migrants’ hardships really existed.
“We must maintain a Strong Southern Border,” the president tweeted. “We cannot allow our Country to be overrun by illegal immigrants as the Democrats tell their phony stories of sadness and grief, hoping it will help them in the elections. Obama and others had the same pictures, and did nothing about it!”

Trump’s suggestion that the stories were erroneous was likely fueled by revelations Friday about one of the defining images to this point in the crisis, a 2-year-old Honduran girl crying as her mother was stopped by a Border Patrol agent. But the girl in the photograph, who ended up on the cover of Time Magazine this week, was not separated from her mother but detained with her, the child’s father told the Daily Mail. Time Magazine said it stood by the image because it captures “the stakes of this moment.”
Trump has long chafed at the media’s treatment, his fury only growing in the past week when he felt that he did not receive proper credit for his summit in Singapore with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. He told the Trinity Broadcasting Network, in an interview with former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee set to air Saturday, that he found the news coverage “almost treasonous.”
Some conservatives seized hold of the migrant photo faux pas to attack the media, and White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders tweeted, “It’s shameful that dems and the media exploited this photo of a little girl to push their agenda.”
Other Trump allies have gone even further. Ann Coulter, a conservative pundit, said Sunday in an interview on Fox News that kids at the border were “actor children” who were “given scripts to read by liberals.”
Coulter then turned to the camera and said to Trump, “Don’t fall for it.”
A number of Democrats aggressively pushed back against Trump’s claims. Rep. Peter Welch of Vermont said Friday that Trump’s assertion was “bizarre” and that the border patrol processing center he visited in Texas in recent days was “nothing short of a prison.”
As part of his defense for his zero tolerance border crossing policy, Trump has frequently pointed to — and exaggerated — the threat posed by members of the violent gang MS-13 who have entered the United States. In what was likely not a coincidence, the Justice Department on Friday unsealed an indictment charging 11 suspected MS-13 gang members in connection with the killings of two teens in Virginia. All the suspects were from El Salvador.
But the central piece of Trump’s attempts to counter-program against the despairing images at the border was to stand with the “angel families,” as he did repeatedly during his presidential campaign, including at the 2016 Republican National Convention. At the somber event at the White House complex on Friday, Trump introduced the families, who delivered heartbreaking tales of their loved ones’ lives and, at times, gruesome descriptions of their deaths.
Many of them held large photos of their loved ones, some of which the president autographed. Trump said that one of the victims looked like the actor Tom Selleck.
“Your loss will not have been in vain,” Trump said. “We will secure our borders, and we will make sure that they’re properly taken care of.”
The president also rattled off a litany of statistics that indicated that illegal immigrants commit violent crimes at a far higher rate than U.S. citizens, saying “you hear it’s like they’re better people than what we have, than our citizens. It’s not true.”
But his assertion has been contradicted by a number of studies, including one by the Cato Institute and another in the journal Criminology that found that places with higher percentages of undocumented immigrants do not have higher rates of crime.
A Homeland Security report said there were 972 calls reporting crimes to its Victims of Immigration Crime Engagement hotline from April 26 through Sept. 30 last year. The hotline handled a total of 4,602 calls including general comments. The report said some of the calls were made for victim impact statements that lead to the deportation of someone who commits a crime. Victims also testified in immigration court proceedings, and their calls led to the arrest and detention of others.
At the event, Trump also bashed “the mayor of San Diego” for warning citizens about immigration agent raids. But the mayor of San Diego, Kevin Faulconer, is a Republican who did not provide a tip; a mayor who did was Libby Schaaf, a Democrat from Oakland,.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement posted a notice saying it is looking into creating 15,000 beds for use in detaining immigrant families. A day earlier, the Pentagon agreed to provide space for as many as 20,000 migrants on U.S. military bases.
Beyond that, however, there was nothing but frustration and worry for many of the parents separated from their children and placed in detention centers for illegally entering the country over the past several weeks.
Some parents struggled to get in touch with youngsters being held in many cases hundreds of miles away, in places like New York and the Chicago area. Some said they didn’t even know where their children were.
Trump himself took a hard line on the crisis, accusing the Democrats of telling “phony stories of sadness and grief.”
“We cannot allow our country to be overrun by illegal immigrants,” the president tweeted.
More than 2,300 children were taken from their families at the border in recent weeks. A senior Trump administration official said that about 500 of them have been reunited since May.
Trump’s decision to stop separating families, announced Wednesday after a fierce international outcry, has led to confusion and uncertainty along the border.
Federal agencies are working to set up a centralized reunification process for all remaining children at a detention center in Texas, said the senior administration official, who was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity.
An ICE official said it is unclear how families will be reunified.
“It’s a big question. There have not been a lot of answers,” Henry Lucero, a director of field operations, confessed at a forum in Weslaco, Texas.

In the meantime, federal authorities appear to be easing up on the Trump administration’s “zero tolerance” policy of prosecuting all adults caught illegally entering the U.S. — though the Justice Department flatly denied there has been any change.
The federal public defender’s office for the region that covers El Paso to San Antonio said in an email that prosecutors will no longer charge parents with illegally entering the U.S. if they have children with them.
Outside the federal courthouse in McAllen, immigration attorney Efren Olivares said 67 people were charged Friday morning with illegal entry, but none were parents with children. He said it was the first time since May 24 that that happened in McAllen.
“It appears that this is a consequence of a change in policy by the government,” he said.
ICE has only three facilities nationwide — two in Texas, one in Pennsylvania — that can be used to detain immigrant families, and they have a combined 3,300 beds.
The one in Dilley, Texas, opened in 2015 on a remote site that was once an encampment for oil workers. It contains collections of cottages built around playgrounds and common areas, but also has high security.
Finding space is not the only hurdle: Under a 1997 court settlement that the Trump administration is trying to overturn, children can be held with their parents in detention centers for no more than 20 days.
– Zenen Jaimes Perez of the Texas Civil Rights Project
Zenen Jaimes Perez of the Texas Civil Rights Project said immigrant families are still awaiting details from the administration on how parents and children are to be reunited.
“It could take a couple of months, a couple of days … but we don’t have timelines,” Jaimes Perez said. “What we need to hear is what the administration says this process is going to look like, because we don’t know.”
The group has been interviewing migrants each morning at the McAllen courthouse and entering information into a database to help keep track of parents and children held in different facilities, sometimes scattered around the country.
Olivares said it is difficult for government agencies to reunite immigrant families once they are separated because the systems that process adults and those that handle youngsters often don’t communicate with each other.
Adults accused of immigration offenses are under the authority of the Homeland Security Department, while youngsters taken from their parents are overseen by Health and Human Services.
Meanwhile, a 7-year-old boy and his mother, separated a month ago, were reunited Friday after she sued in federal court and the Justice Department agreed to release the child.
They were brought back together around 2:30 a.m. at Baltimore-Washington International Airport in Maryland, hours after the government relented.

The mother, Beata Mariana de Jesus Mejia-Mejia, had filed for political asylum after crossing the border with her son, Darwin, following a trek from Guatemala. She said that she cried when the two were reunited and that she is never going to be away from him again.
But a 31-year-old Brazilian man held in Cibola County Correctional Center in Milan, New Mexico, said he didn’t know when he would see his 9-year-old son again.
The father told the AP in a phone interview that he spoke to his son once by phone since they were separated 26 days earlier. The man, who is seeking asylum, spoke on condition of anonymity because, he said, a gang is looking for him in Brazil for failure to pay an $8,000 debt.
The man said he worries about his son, who speaks only Portuguese.
“He cried. He was so sad,” the father said. “I had promised him it would only be three to five days.”
On Capitol Hill, in yet another abrupt reversal by the president, Trump on Friday told fellow Republicans in Congress to “stop wasting their time” on immigration legislation until after the November elections.
Stubborn differences between conservative and more moderate Republicans have stalled legislation on Capitol Hill.

Trump’s tweets come just days after he insisted Congress needed to act to resolve the problems at the U.S.-Mexico border. But stubborn differences between conservative and more moderate Republicans in the House have stalled immigration legislation on Capitol Hill, with a vote on a compromise measure delayed until next week.
Trump said Friday that even if a measure passes, it’s doomed in the Senate.
“Republicans should stop wasting their time on Immigration until after we elect more Senators and Congressmen/women in November,” he tweeted. “Dems are just playing games, have no intention of doing anything to solves this decades old problem. We can pass great legislation after the Red Wave!”

— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 22, 2018
Trump’s comments come amid an international outcry over the separation of migrant families at the southern border. Trump asserted Thursday that Congress could provide the “only real solution” to the crisis.
They also follow on days of congressional wrangling as GOP leadership had been hoping Trump could help sell immigration legislation to wary members. The last ditch effort on immigration ahead of the midterm elections was meant to help vulnerable Republicans this fall.
Trump himself travelled to Capitol Hill Tuesday to make the case that Congress should pass either of two bills that have been under consideration, and on Wednesday postponed the annual Congressional Picnic that had been scheduled for Thursday at the White House so that lawmakers could work to pass them.
A measure backed by conservative lawmakers failed Thursday. Hours later Republican leaders postponed final voting on what was billed as a compromise immigration package until next week as negotiators made a last-ditch push for support.
GOP leaders trying to persuade colleagues to seize the moment and tackle immigration problems by approving the bill, which includes $25 billion for Trump’s border wall and a path to citizenship for young immigrants who have lived in the U.S. illegally since childhood.
Calling Democrats “obstructionists” and accusing them of not caring about border security, Trump tweeted Friday that voters need to elect more Republicans.
“Even if we get 100% Republican votes in the Senate, we need 10 Democrat votes to get a much needed Immigration Bill,” Trump said.
Despite the president’s prediction of a “Red wave” this fall, Republicans are facing an uphill battle this November as they seek to hold onto control of the House and Senate. Headwinds from the controversy-embracing president and a wave of retirements in the House have put the GOP majority at severe risk.
Democrats face a more challenging map to retaking control in the Senate, with the GOP eyeing pick-ups of seats in states Trump carried in 2016."
https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/what-was-the-message-behind-melania-trumps-jacket,migrant,534,2018-06-21T19:02:17-04:00,"Darlene Superville, Associated Press",What was the message behind Melania Trump’s jacket?,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Melania Trump went to Texas to show she cared about migrant children. Her fashion choice carried a baffling counter-message.
The first lady wore a green, hooded military jacket from the fast-fashion brand Zara that read “I really don’t care, do u?” both as she departed and returned to Washington. The words were printed in white, in graffiti-style, on the jacket’s back.
When asked what message the first lady intended to send, spokeswoman Stephanie Grisham said: “It’s a jacket. There was no hidden message. After today’s important visit to Texas, I hope the media isn’t going to choose to focus on her wardrobe. ”
Grisham underscored that message in a tweet with the hashtags #SheCares and #ItsJustAJacket.
But President Donald Trump offered his own interpretation, tweeting that it “refers to the Fake News Media. Melania has learned how dishonest they are, and she truly no longer cares!”
Mrs. Trump changed into a pale yellow jacket before the plane landed in McAllen, Texas, for a visit to the Upbring New Hope Children’s Center, which houses 55 migrant children. But even after questions arose about her attire, Mrs. Trump was back in the green jacket when she returned to Washington in 80-degree weather. She has shown that she won’t bow to public pressure or expectations about how she should comport herself as first lady.
Like it or not, Mrs. Trump’s jacket, which reportedly retailed at $39, had her trending on Twitter. One outraged user borrowed an image of the back of the jacket to promote groups working on behalf of immigrant children.
Zara, a Spain-based company with a large presence in the United States and around the world, had no comment. The jacket belongs to the Zara’s spring-summer 2016 season and is no longer for sale by the company, though a few of the jackets popped up online for resale at a moderate profit for sellers.
The youthful jacket sharply contrasts with the first lady’s typically bold, foreign-flavored and higher-priced wardrobe. In public appearances, the first lady has worn designs by Dolce & Gabbana (remember her $51,500 D&G jacket at the G-7 summit in Italy?), Del Pozo, Christian Dior, Emilio Pucci, Givenchy and Valentino, often with daringly high Christian Louboutin heels.
It’s not the first time the first lady’s fashion choices have caused a stir.
Last August, a pair of Mrs. Trump’s signature spike heels earned her a round of bafflement as she boarded Air Force One bound for Texas to tour devastation after Hurricane Harvey. She had changed into white sneakers by the time she and the president landed.
At the second 2016 presidential debate, Mrs. Trump showed up in a fuchsia silk blouse with a large bow at the neck, long known as a “pussy bow blouse.” That was just days after reports surfaced that her husband had made lewd remarks years earlier about grabbing women by the genitals.
On the other side of the political aisle, former first lady Michelle Obama routinely caught grief from some critics for going sleeveless. Her husband, President Barack Obama, was the talk of a 24-hour news cycle when he donned a tan suit in 2014 for a media briefing.

More than 2,300 children have been separated from their parents since May as part of Trump’s zero-tolerance policy, which criminally prosecutes all people who have come across the border illegally, according to the Department of Homeland Security.
That policy sparked widespread outcry for what many considered inhumane treatment. Images taken at detention centers showed children being kept in large metal cages apart from their parents and ProPublica released audio of children crying for their family after being detained.
The executive order aims to address those concerns, but has also created some confusion over what happens to children who have already been separated from their parents as well as to families that will now be detained together.
Here’s what we know.
The executive order makes it clear the policy of zero-tolerance will remain in place “until and unless Congress directs otherwise.”

No plan has been announced.
“It is still very early and we are awaiting further guidance on the matter,” said Brian Marriott, the communications director for the division of the Department of Health and Human Services that is in charge of detaining children and later placing them with sponsors while they go through immigration court.
That worries advocates who have pointed to a number of factors that could complicate parents’ ability to find their children again. Some adults and children can’t write or read in English. Some children have been taken to different states. One in five immigrant children detained under the zero-tolerance policy are younger than 13, according to Kaiser Health News. Some children could have lost pieces of paper with relatives’ contact information, or forgotten a phone number they’d once memorized.
Plus, even if children are returned to their parents quickly, the trauma could have lifelong effects, advocates say.
“It’s important to recognize there’s an injury and a trauma that you inflict on these children from separating them from their parents that cannot be made up for by allowing them to play on a soccer field or making sure someone is there to read them a book,” Omar Jadwat, the director of the ACLU’s Immigrants Rights Project, told the PBS NewsHour.
Washington and eight other states announced Thursday they planned to file a lawsuit against the Trump administration over its family separation policy, saying it violated the due process rights of children and their parents. Trump’s executive order did not resolve that issue, Washington Attorney General Bob Ferguson said in a news conference.

New York is filing its own lawsuit that alleges the family separation policy violated parental rights. Trump’s latest executive order did not address that concern, either, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said.
The Trump administration aims to keep families detained together throughout their criminal or immigration proceedings. But that conflicts with something known as the “Flores agreement,” a 1997 court settlement that sets standards for federal detention of unaccompanied minor children. The agreement mandates that children be placed in the “least restrictive setting” possible, and also that they are held no longer than 20 days.
The executive order directs Sessions to file a request with the court in charge of the Flores settlement to allow the Department of Homeland Security to detain children with their parents for longer than 20 days. The DOJ filed that request Thursday.
It’s not clear what will happen if the court rejects that request.
On Thursday, the Pentagon said it had been asked to find space on military bases to house up to 20,000 unaccompanied children, according to the Washington Post, a strategy the Obama administration used for about 7,000 migrant children during the Central American migrant crisis in 2014. Beds would need to be available from now through Dec. 31, according to the request from the Department of Health and Human Services."

Lawyers filed a memorandum to a settlement in California that governs how children are handled when they are caught crossing the U.S. border illegally. The Flores settlement states that families cannot be detained longer than 20 days.
The move is aimed at stopping the separation of children from their families amid a new policy where anyone caught crossing the border is charged criminally.
The request comes a day after President Donald Trump signed an order stopping the practice that has resulted in the separation of more than 2,300 children from their families. The Trump administration’s so-called zero tolerance policy will remain in place, but families will be kept together in detention.
Despite Trump’s executive order, a host of unanswered questions remain, including what will happens to the children who were already separated from their parents and where the government will house all the newly detained migrants, with the system already bursting at the seams.

In the Texas border city of McAllen on Thursday, prosecutors unexpectedly dropped charges against 17 immigrants who were due to be sentenced Thursday for improperly entering the U.S., according to Efren Olivares, a lawyer with the Texas Civil Rights Project, which has been interviewing adult immigrants to track them and their kids through separate government systems.
Speaking outside of the federal courthouse, Olivares said the 17 likely would be placed in immigration detention. He didn’t know whether they would be reunited with their children immediately or whether they might be released altogether.
Asked if they had any reaction to the charges against them being dropped, he said, “They’re asking about their children, frankly.”
Meanwhile, three of the 12 immigrant children at a Catholic Charities shelter in Fort Worth, near Dallas, were expected to be reunited with their family on Thursday.

Heather Reynolds, the nonprofit’s director, says the three are among 12 immigrant children at the shelter who were separated from their parents under a Trump administration “zero tolerance” policy. She says half are boys and half are girls, and they range in age from age 5 to 12.
Reynolds declined to provide details about the three kids who are expected to be reunited with family Thursday.
She says Present Donald Trump’s executive order Wednesday allowing immigrant kids to remain with their parents mentions how future illegal border crossing will be handled, but it doesn’t address the more than 2,000 children who have already been separated since May. She says this leaves groups like hers “uncertain” about how to manage those kids already in detention in the U.S.
First lady Melania Trump made a surprise visit Thursday to a McAllen detention center that’s housing some of the children, where she asked kids where they came from and how long they had been at the facility.
She told children to “be kind and nice to each other” as she left one classroom and said she wanted to lend her support to the children, and asked staff to reunite them with their families as quickly as possible.

It was a dramatic turnaround for Trump, who has been insisting, wrongly, that his administration had no choice but to separate families apprehended at the border because of federal law and a court decision.
The news in recent days has been dominated by searing images of children held in cages at border facilities, as well as audio recordings of young children crying for their parents — images that have sparked fury, question of morality and concern from Republicans about a negative impact on their races in November’s midterm elections.
Read Trump’s full executive order on family separation
Until Wednesday, the president, Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen and other officials had repeatedly argued the only way to end the practice was for Congress to pass new legislation, while Democrats said he could do it with his signature alone. That’s what he did on Wednesday.
“We’re going to have strong, very strong borders, but we’re going to keep the families together,” said Trump who said he didn’t like the “sight” or “feeling” of children separated from their parents.
He said his order would not end the “zero-tolerance” policy that criminally prosecutes all adults caught crossing the border illegally. The order aims to keep families together while they are in custody, expedite their cases, and ask the Department of Defense to help house families.
Justice Department lawyers had been working to find a legal workaround for a previous class-action settlement that set policies for the treatment and release of unaccompanied children who are caught at the border.
Still, Trump’s order is likely to create a new set of problems involving length of detention of families, and may spark a fresh court fight.
Also playing a role in his turnaround: First lady Melania Trump. One White House official said Mrs. Trump had been making her opinion known to the president for some time that she felt he needed to do all he could to help families stay together, whether by working with Congress or acting on his own.
Nielsen traveled to Capitol Hill Wednesday afternoon to brief lawmakers. And members on the fence over pending immigration legislation headed to the White House to meet with Trump.
Trump had tweeted earlier Wednesday, “It’s the Democrats fault, they won’t give us the votes needed to pass good immigration legislation. They want open borders, which breeds horrible crime. Republicans want security. But I am working on something – it never ends!”
The administration recently put into place a “zero tolerance” policy in which all unlawful border crossings are referred for prosecution — a process that moves adults to the custody of the U.S. Marshals Service and sends many children to facilities run by the Department of Health and Human Services. Under the Obama administration, such families were usually referred for civil deportation proceedings, not requiring separation.
The policy had led to a spike in family separations in recent weeks, with more than 2,300 minors were separated from their families at the border from May 5 through June 9, according to the Department of Homeland Security.
Two people close to Homeland Security Secretary Nielsen said early Wednesday that she was the driving force behind the plan to keep families together after they are detained crossing the border illegally.
One of the people said Nielsen, who had become the face of the administration’s policy, had little faith that Congress would act to fix the separation issue and felt compelled to act. Nielsen was heckled at a restaurant Tuesday evening and has faced protesters at her home.
But others pushed back on the idea that Homeland Security had led the rollback. One official said it was the Justice Department that generated the legal strategy that is codified in the working executive order, and disputed the notion that Homeland Security was involved in drawing up the document.

Planning at the Justice Department had been underway over the past several days to provide the president with options on the growing crisis, said the official, who, like others, spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the effort before its official announcement.
The person said Trump called the Justice Department Wednesday morning asking for the draft order. The official did not know what prompted Trump to change course.
The Flores settlement, named for a teenage girl who brought the case in the 1980s, requires the government to release children from custody and to their parents, adult relatives or other caretakers, in order of preference. If those options are exhausted, authorities must find the “least restrictive” setting for the child who arrived without parents.
In 2015, a federal judge in Los Angeles expanded the terms of the settlement, ruling that it applies to children who are caught with their parents as well as to those who come to the U.S. alone. Other recent rulings, upheld on appeal, affirm the children’s rights to a bond hearing and require better conditions at the Border Patrol’s short-term holding facilities.
In 2016, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that child migrants who came to the border with parents and were held in custody must be released. The decision did not state parents must be released. Neither, though, did it require parents to be kept in detention, apart from their children.

(AP) — Hours after reversing himself to end the forced separations of migrant families, President Donald Trump returned to the warm embrace of his supporters at a raucous rally to defend his hard-line immigration policies while unleashing a torrent of grievances about the media and those investigating him.
Trump downplayed the crisis that has threatened to envelop the White House amid days of heart-wrenching images of children being pulled from their immigrant parents along the nation’s southern border. He made only a brief mention of his decision to sign an executive order after spending days insisting, wrongly, that his administration had no choice but to separate families apprehended at the border because of federal law and a court decision.
“We’re going to keep families together and the border is going to be just as tough as it’s been,” Trump told the cheering crowd in Duluth on Wednesday night.
Seemingly motivated to promote his hawkish immigration bona fides after his about-face on forced separations, the president denounced his political opponents and those who make unauthorized border crossings, suggesting that the money used to care for those immigrants could be better spent on the nation’s rural communities and inner cities.
“Democrats put illegal immigrants before they put American citizens. What the hell is going on?” asked Trump, prompting the crowd to chant “Build the wall!”
He even invoked his campaign kickoff speech, held three years ago this week, in which he declared that Mexico “wasn’t sending their best” in terms of migrants crossing into the U.S. That wasn’t the only throwback moment at the rally, featuring a packed arena festooned with American flags and approximately 8,000 people responding in chants to many of Trump’s cues.
He fumed over what he deemed “dishonest” coverage of his summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. He raved about the economy and his tough new tariffs meant to create fair trade. And he erroneously suggested that a recent Justice Department watchdog report into the FBI’s handling of the Hillary Clinton email probe proved his innocence in the special counsel’s Russia investigation while covering up Clinton’s guilt.
“Have you been seeing this whole scam? Do you believe what you’re seeing — how that no matter what she did, no matter how many crimes she committed, which were numerous, they wanted her to be innocent,” Trump said. “But with me, nothing. No collusion, no nothing. They wanted to put us in trouble.”
The crowd responded with a “Lock her up!” chant. Trump simply shook his head.
Again attacking the special counsel probe as a “witch hunt,” Trump went on to blast the media for focusing on the recent immigration crisis at the expense of covering what he contends is bias against him at the FBI. He also accused the media of providing one-sided reports about his Singapore summit with Kim.
“We had a great meeting. We had great chemistry,” said Trump, who predicted that Kim “will turn that country into a great successful country.”
“These people,” said Trump, gesturing to the media at the back of the arena, “say, ‘He’s given away so much.’ You know what I gave up? A meeting.”
The Duluth rally was Trump’s first in a blue state since taking office. He narrowly lost Minnesota in 2016. And with the industrial and upper Midwest looming large for Trump’s re-election hopes, the president vowed to spend more time there before 2020.
“You know, I hate to bring this up, but we came this close to winning the state of Minnesota,” the president said. “And in 2½ years, it’s going to be really easy, I think.”
Trump was in Minnesota to back Pete Stauber, a Republican congressional candidate running in a traditionally Democratic district. Home of the Iron Range, Minnesota is a place where Trump’s tariffs on foreign steel could play especially well. While economists wince and farmers brace for blowback, the crowd cheered when tariffs were mentioned on Wednesday. Trump also held a small roundtable with representatives from the mining industry and local leaders before the rally.
Trump brought Stauber to the stage and offered an enthusiastic endorsement. But he made no mention of the state’s GOP gubernatorial primary to replace outgoing Democratic Gov. Mark Dayton. It pits former Gov. Tim Pawlenty, a Trump critic running for his old job, against Jeff Johnson, the state GOP’s endorsed candidate who has been stronger in his support of the president.
Energized by the roaring crowd in his first rally since the Singapore summit, Trump soaked in the applause and caustically dismissed a few protesters who tried to interrupt. He beamed as the crowd chanted “Space Force!” in response to his plan to create a new branch of the military to safeguard the cosmos. And he leaned hard into his self-appointed role as champion of the working class and defender of traditional American values, but also mocked the idea that his opponents — whether liberals or media executives — were always called “the elite.”
“The elite! Why are they elite?” Trump wondered. “I have a much better apartment than they do. I’m smarter than they are. I’m richer than they are. I became president and they didn’t.”

“We want to keep families together. It’s very important,” Trump told reporters during a White House meeting with members of Congress. “I’ll be signing something in a little while that’s going to do that.”
The effort would mark a dramatic turnaround for an administration that has been insisting, wrongly, that it has no choice but to separate families apprehended at the border because of the law and a court decision.
Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, the president and other officials have repeatedly said the only way to end the practice is for Congress to pass new legislation, though both Democrats and some Republicans have said the president could reverse it by himself.
The news in recent days has been dominated by searing images of children held in cages at border facilities, as well as audio recordings of young children crying for their parents — images that have sparked fury, question of morality and concern from Republicans about a negative impact on their races in November’s midterm elections.
Trump pointed to those images in his meeting, saying they’d “affect everybody” but that he was torn. “We want the heart,” he said, “but we also want strong borders and we want no crime.”

Also playing a role: First lady Melania Trump. One White House official said Mrs. Trump had been making her opinion known to the president for some time that she felt he needed to do all he could to help families stay together, whether it was by working with Congress or acting on his own.
On Capitol Hill, some who have criticized the policy sounded cautiously optimistic.
If the president goes through with the signing, “It would be a complete 180. Clearly the president is hearing the uproar from our communities,” said Rep. Pete Aguilar, D-Calif.
Nielsen was to travel to the Hill Wednesday afternoon to brief lawmakers. And members on the fence over pending immigration legislation were also heading to the White House to meet with Trump.
Trump had tweeted earlier Wednesday, “It’s the Democrats fault, they won’t give us the votes needed to pass good immigration legislation. They want open borders, which breeds horrible crime. Republicans want security. But I am working on something – it never ends!”
The administration recently put into place a “zero tolerance” policy in which all unlawful border crossings are referred for prosecution — a process that moves adults to the custody of the U.S. Marshals Service and sends many children to facilities run by the Department of Health and Human Services. Under the Obama administration, such families were usually referred for civil deportation proceedings, not requiring separation.

The policy had led to a spike in family separations in recent weeks, with more than 2,300 minors were separated from their families at the border from May 5 through June 9, according to the Department of Homeland Security.
The action, according to people familiar with it, wouldn’t end the zero tolerance policy, but would aim to keep families together while they are in custody and ask the Department of Defense to help house the detained families.
Justice Department lawyers have been working to find a legal workaround for a class-action lawsuit settlement that set policies for the treatment and release of unaccompanied children who are caught at the border, or crafting an order that would defy the settlement and force it back into court to argue for changes.
Two people close to Homeland Security Secretary Nielsen said early Wednesday that she was the driving force behind the plan to keep families together after they are detained crossing the border illegally.
One of the people said Nielsen, who had become the face of the administration’s policy, had little faith that Congress would act to fix the separation issue and felt compelled to act. Nielsen was heckled at a restaurant Tuesday evening and has faced protesters at her home.
But others pushed back on the idea that Homeland Security had led the rollback. One official said it was the Justice Department that generated the legal strategy that is codified in the executive order, and disputed the notion that Homeland Security was involved in drawing up the document.
Planning at the Justice Department had been underway over the past several days to provide the president with options on the growing crisis, said the official, who, like others, spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the effort before its official announcement.
The person said Trump called the Justice Department Wednesday morning asking for the draft order. The official did not know what prompted Trump to change course.
The Flores settlement, named for a teenage girl who brought the case in the 1980s, requires the government to release children from custody and to their parents, adult relatives or other caretakers, in order of preference. If those options are exhausted, authorities must find the “least restrictive” setting for the child who arrived without parents.
In 2015, a federal judge in Los Angeles expanded the terms of the settlement, ruling that it applies to children who are caught with their parents as well as to those who come to the U.S. alone. Other recent rulings, upheld on appeal, affirm the children’s rights to a bond hearing and require better conditions at the Border Patrol’s short-term holding facilities.
In 2016, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that child migrants who came to the border with parents and were held in custody must be released. The decision did not state parents must be released. Neither, though, did it require parents to be kept in detention, apart from their children.

President Donald Trump has said he’s “1,000 percent” behind both GOP bills, but restive House Republicans have all but begged GOP leaders for more clarity about what the president would actually sign. Public outcry is mounting over the family separations, but so far, there’s no clear roadmap for Thursday voting on the emotional issue dividing Republicans.
With the immigration bills teetering in the House, the White House launched an eleventh-hour push to try to bring Republicans onboard.
A group of wavering lawmakers was sent to the White House to meet with Trump in hopes he can persuade them, confirmed the office of Rep. Steve Scalise, the GOP whip. Back on Capitol Hill, Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen was set to meet with a larger group of House Republicans.
But congressional action remains uncertain. Facing condemnation of the family separations from across the political spectrum, the White House took action.
Trump on Wednesday signed an executive order drafted by Nielsen that directs her department to keep families together after they are detained crossing the border illegally.
“We’re going to have strong, very strong borders, but we’re going to keep the families together,” said Trump, who added he didn’t like the “sight” or “feeling” of children separated from their parents.
More than 2,300 children were separated from their families at the border from May 5 through June 9, according to DHS.
Under the administration’s current policy, all unlawful crossings are referred for prosecution — a process that moves adults to the custody of the U.S. Marshals Service and sends many children to facilities run by the Department of Health and Human Services. Under the Obama administration, such families were usually referred for civil deportation proceedings, not requiring separation.
Ryan told reporters he prefers to see parents and children detained together in custody, as the GOP bills provide.
“We do not want children taken away from their parents,” he said.
As Republicans met privately Wednesday, House Democrats brought about two dozen immigrant children to the chamber floor in an unusual morning protest that defied House rules as they condemned the separation of families at the border.
Democrats said the images of children being held in cages in border facilities, some crying for their parents, would be a moment remembered in U.S. history. Rep. Luis Gutierrez, D-Ill., said Americans were “standing up for children, standing up for those who are in need.”
As Gutierrez spoke, his microphone was cut off because the gathering in the chamber was considered a breach of decorum. Presiding Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., gaveled the House to order.
GOP lawmakers, increasingly fearful of voter backlash in November, are struggling to find a way out of the problem created by the Trump administration’s policy of putting all immigrants who cross the border in criminal, rather than civil, proceedings that result in family separations.
Many want more clarity from Trump before giving their backing to the broader immigration bills, which also offer different remedies for other provisions on protecting “Dreamer” immigrants from deportation and funding for Trump’s border wall.

“Some of the members wanted to make sure the president is very visible in his support for both bills,” said Rep. Mark Walker, R-N.C., the chairman of the conservative Republican Study Committee, which makes up more than half the GOP majority.
Walker said several lawmakers remained undecided, denying leadership of the majority needed for passage. They want to see Trump’s support “constantly as we move forward — that he’s out there vocally supporting what he believes is the best pathway forward,” Walker said.
Even if Republicans manage to pass one of the immigration bills through the House, it is all but certain to fizzle in the Senate, where Republicans are rallying behind a different approach.
Theirs is narrow legislation proposed by Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, and others that would allow detained families to stay together in custody while expediting their hearings and possible deportation proceedings.
Under the bill, children under age 18 would be kept with their families in residential centers during legal proceedings. Facilities would have to be “secure and safe.” Children would be separated from adults who are not their parent or who have serious criminal records, or if there is evidence of abuse or trafficking.

The government would prioritize processing such families and add 1,000 beds and 225 immigration judges.
“The question is, Do congressional Democrats want to actually solve the problem or do they want an issue to campaign on in November?” Cruz said.
Senate Democrats have rallied behind a bill from Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., that would prohibit migrant families from being separated.

Trump is discussing immigration during remarks in front of the National Federation of Independent Business’s 75th anniversary celebration.
He says he’s requesting a “third option” from Congress that will allow officials to detain children and parents together as a family unit.
A new “zero tolerance” policy from the Trump administration has led to a spike in children being separated from their parents at the border as they seek entry.
Trump says, “we’ve got to stop separation of the families,” but says: “we can’t let people pour in.”
He’s arguing that, “politically correct or not, we have a country that needs security, that needs safety.”

Haley said Tuesday the U.S. had given the human rights body “opportunity after opportunity” to make changes. She lambasted the council for “its chronic bias against Israel” and lamented the fact that its membership includes accused human rights abusers such as China, Cuba, Venezuela and Congo.
“We take this step because our commitment does not allow us to remain a part of a hypocritical and self-serving organization that makes a mockery of human rights,” Haley said.
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, appearing alongside Haley at the State Department, said there was no doubt that the council once had a “noble vision.”
But today we need to be honest,” Pompeo said. “The Human Rights Council is a poor defender of human rights.”
The announcement came just a day after the U.N. human rights chief, Zeid Ra’ad al-Hussein, denounced the Trump administration for separating migrant children from their parents. But Haley cited longstanding U.S. complaints that the 47-member council is biased against Israel. She had been threatening the pull-out since last year unless the council made changes advocated by the U.S.
“Regrettably, it is now clear that our call for reform was not heeded,” Haley said.
Still, she suggested the decision need not be permanent, adding that if the council did adopt reforms, “we would be happy to rejoin it.” She said the withdrawal notwithstanding, the U.S. would continue to defend human rights at the United Nations.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office called the U.S. decision “courageous,” calling it “an unequivocal statement that enough is enough.”
The move extends a broader Trump administration pattern of stepping back from international agreements and forums under the president’s “America First” policy. Although numerous officials have said repeatedly that “America First does not mean America Alone,” the administration has retreated from multiple multilateral accords and consensuses since it took office.
Since January 2017, it has announced its withdrawal from the Paris climate accord, left the U.N. educational and cultural organization and pulled out of the Iran nuclear deal. Other contentious moves have included slapping tariffs on steel and aluminum against key trading partners, recognizing Jerusalem as Israel’s capital and moving the U.S. Embassy there from Tel Aviv.
Opposition to the decision from human rights advocates was swift. A group of 12 organizations including Save the Children, Freedom House and the United Nations Association-USA said there were “legitimate concerns” about the council’s shortcomings but that none of them warranted a U.S. exit.
“This decision is counterproductive to American national security and foreign policy interests and will make it more difficult to advance human rights priorities and aid victims of abuse around the world,” the organizations said in a joint statement.
Added Kenneth Roth, the executive director of Human Rights Watch: “All Trump seems to care about is defending Israel.”
On Twitter, al-Hussein, the U.N. human rights chief, said it was “Disappointing, if not really surprising, news. Given the state of #HumanRights in today’s world, the US should be stepping up, not stepping back.”
And the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank close to the Trump administration, defended the move, calling the council “notably incurious about the human rights situations in some of the world’s most oppressive countries.” Brett Schaefer, a senior fellow, pointed out that Trump could have withdrawn immediately after taking office but instead gave the council 18 months to make changes.
Haley has been the driving force behind withdrawing from the human rights body, unprecedented in the 12-year history of the council. No country has ever dropped out voluntarily. Libya was kicked out seven years ago.
The move could reinforce the perception that the Trump administration is seeking to advance Israel’s agenda on the world stage, just as it prepares to unveil its long-awaited Israeli-Palestinian peace plan despite Palestinian outrage over the embassy relocation. Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner, is visiting the Middle East this week as the White House works to lay the groundwork for unveiling the plan.
Israel is the only country in the world whose rights record comes up for discussion at every council session, under “Item 7” on the agenda. Item 7 on “Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories” has been part of the council’s regular business almost as long as it has existed.
The United States’ current term on the council ends next year. Although the U.S. could have remained a non-voting observer on the council, a U.S. official said it was a “complete withdrawal” and that the United States was resigning its seat “effective immediately.” The official wasn’t authorized to comment publicly and insisted on anonymity.
That means the council will be left without one of its traditional defenders of human rights. In recent months, the United States has participated in attempts to pinpoint rights violations in places like South Sudan, Congo and Cambodia.
The U.S. pullout was bound to have ripple effects for at least two countries at the council: China and Israel. The U.S., as at other U.N. organizations, is Israel’s biggest defender. At the rights council, the United States has recently been the most unabashed critic of rights abuses in China — whose growing economic and diplomatic clout has chastened some other would-be critics, rights advocates say.
The Chinese government expressed regret over Washington’s decision to pull out of the council. In Beijing, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesman said the council is “an important platform” for countries to discuss human rights and that Beijing has been committed to supporting the group’s work.
But the Chinese government is often accused by Western countries of human rights violations and by rights groups of seeking to undermine the mechanisms of the U.N. human rights council. In March, a Chinese diplomat repeatedly interrupted a speech by a prominent Chinese dissident to block him from addressing the U.N. Human Rights Council, a failed attempt that bared China’s sensitivity on human rights.
The foreign ministry spokesman, Geng Shuang, dismissed the U.S. criticism that the council is problematic because it includes China and other authoritarian governments, saying that claim is “a total disregard of facts.” ”Everyone without bias can see clearly China’s great achievement and progress in terms of human rights,” Geng said.
There are 47 countries in the Human Rights Council, elected by the U.N.’s General Assembly with a specific number of seats allocated for each region of the globe. Members serve for three-year terms and can serve only two terms in a row.
The United States has opted to stay out of the Human Rights Council before: The George W. Bush administration opted against seeking membership when the council was created in 2006. The U.S. joined the body only in 2009 under President Barack Obama.

Trump’s meeting late Tuesday afternoon with House Republicans comes at a time when lawmakers in both parties are up in arms over the administration’s “zero tolerance” approach to illegal border crossings.
Under the policy, all unlawful crossings are referred for prosecution — a process that moves adults to the custody of the U.S. Marshals Service and sends many children to facilities run by the Department of Health and Human Services. Under the previous administration, such families were usually referred for civil deportation proceedings, not requiring separation.
Nearly 2,000 children were separated from their families over a six-week period in April and May.

The fight is erupting at a time when the House was already embroiled in an election-year struggle over immigration legislation that threatens to hurt Republicans in November.
Democrats have seized on the family separation issue, swarming detention centers in Texas to highlight the policy. They are demanding that the administration act to keep migrant families together. Republicans are increasingly joining Democrats in that call.
Michigan Republican Rep. Fred Upton called for an immediate end to the “ugly and inhumane practice,” adding, “It’s never acceptable to use kids as bargaining chips in political process.” Kansas GOP Sen. Pat Roberts said he is “against using parental separation as a deterrent to illegal immigration.”
“The time is now for the White House to end the cruel, tragic separations of families,” Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, said in a statement.
The Trump administration insists the family separations are required under the law.
At a White House briefing Monday, Homeland Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen declared, “Congress alone can fix it.” That line has been echoed by others in the administration, including Trump himself, who has falsely blamed a law passed by Democrats for the “zero tolerance” approach to prosecutions of families crossing the border.

Two immigration bills under consideration in the House could address the separations, but the outlook for passage is dim. Conservatives say the compromise legislation that GOP leaders helped negotiate with moderates is inadequate.
Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, a member of the Freedom Caucus, said he’s skeptical that even a full-throated endorsement from Trump will be enough to get the compromise bill through the House.
The compromise bill shifts away from the nation’s longtime preference for family immigration to a new system that prioritizes entry based on merits and skills. It beefs up border security, clamps down on illegal entries and reinforces other immigration laws.
To address the rise of families being separated at the border, the measure proposes keeping children in detention with their parents, undoing 2-decade-old rules that limit the time minors can be held in custody.
Rep. Dave Brat, R-Va., another Freedom Caucus member, said he expects the GOP compromise bill to be defeated if it reaches the floor. “There’s not enough votes because it doesn’t solve the problem,” he said.
Faced with the prospect of gridlock in the House, senators appear willing to take matters into their own hands.
Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, the No. 2 Republican leader, said Senate Republicans are working on language to address the family separations that could receive a floor vote, potentially as part of a spending bill package.
“I don’t think the answer to family separation is to not enforce the law. I think the answer to family separation is: Don’t separate families while you’re enforcing the law,” Cornyn told reporters. “It’s all within our power, and people have to overcome their desire to preserve an issue to campaign on.”
Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa, the Republican chairman of the Judiciary Committee, said he wants to do away with a legal settlement that requires the government to release children from custody and to their parents, adult relatives or other caretakers, in order of preference.

GOP senators including Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Jeff Flake of Arizona and Susan Collins of Maine also said they’ve been discussing family separation legislation.
Graham told reporters the measure would keep migrant families together, provide additional judges so detained families would face shorter waiting periods, and supply facilities for the families to stay. He said he did not know how much the proposal would cost.
The administration, meanwhile, is hoping to force Democrats to vote for the bills or bear some of the political cost in November’s midterm elections. Democrats brushed aside that pressure.
“As everyone who has looked at this agrees, this was done by the president, not Democrats. He can fix it tomorrow if he wants to, and if he doesn’t want to, he should own up to the fact that he’s doing it,” said Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York.
Senate Democrats have rallied behind an immigration bill from Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif. Her bill would prohibit the separation of migrant children from their parents, with exceptions for findings of child abuse or trafficking. If separations occur, Homeland Security would have to provide clear guidelines for how parents can contact their kids.
One House Republican in a swing district, Rep. Mike Coffman of Colorado, said he’s willing to endorse the Feinstein bill if that’s what it takes.
“I reached out to Sen. Feinstein’s office to let her know I want to help her put a stop to this human rights disaster at the border. If that means introducing her bill in the House, I’d be honored to stand with her,” he said.

Corral hopes his poems make the internal lives of immigrants visible, something he said is forgotten or intentionally omitted in the national conversation.
But laying bare the nuanced humanity of the immigrant experience includes writing about flaws, according to Corral.
In one poem that’s part of a series inspired by water barrels left for border crossers in the Sonoran desert, a woman who lacks access to food and water barely survives her crossing. What is she carrying with her? “A lot of internalized racism, colorism, anti-indigenous sentiment,” said Corral.
In the desert, the moon
shivers. Tonight, to stay awake, I’ll cut my feet
with glass.
Outside Oaxaca, in a clinic, my mother said,
“I hate your Indian face.”
In the dream I’m running. My limbs skeletal
and scabbed.
Corral was inspired by photographs of water stations near Tucson, Arizona. The blue barrels, placed by a humanitarian group called Humane Borders, are a common sight in the deserts of Baja Arizona, marked by 30-foot flags so that they can be seen by migrants crossing from a distance.
“So in my mind,” said Corral, “I converted these barrels into text,” and the barrels became “containers for the cerebral, the mental, the emotional, because that gets often lost when we talk about immigration.”
Eduardo C. Corral (Photo by Matt Valentine)
Envisioning the stations as vessels for text, Corral imagined immigrants inscribing fears and hopes onto the sides of the containers, revealing their inner lives through language both lifelike and fantastical depending on their mental state while crossing.
The son of migrants who crossed into Nogales, Arizona, in the ‘70s, Corral says his “gaze, heart and soul” are always attuned to border issues. The Trump administration’s use of family separation at the border reminds Corral of how rare it is that migrants get full acknowledgment of their humanity.
“We keep seeing immigrants from Mexico, Central America, as labor force,” Corral said. “[We] see them as…just physical beings right? No! Everybody has a mind, a heart, a soul.”
Corral hopes his work adds vital dimension to the current conversation.
“There are days when I sit down at the desk like, ‘What am I doing at the desk? I should be out in the field. I should be doing something to really mobilize and do something,’” Corral said. “But we do need poets…from these kinds of background, Mexican-Americans, from El Salvador, from Guatemala, telling these stories.”

Aparicio is undeterred by a new directive from Attorney General Jeff Sessions declaring that gang and domestic violence will generally cease to be grounds for asylum. To him, it’s better to take his chances with the American asylum system and stay in Mexico if his bid is denied.
“Imagine what would happen if I was deported to El Salvador,” he said Wednesday as he waited at the border to enter the U.S.
The directive announced Monday could have far-reaching consequences because of the sheer volume of people like Aparicio fleeing gang violence, which is so pervasive in Central America that merely stepping foot in the wrong neighborhood can lead to death.
The Associated Press interviewed several asylum-seekers this past week at a plaza on the border, and each of them cited gang violence as the main factor in fleeing their homelands. They planned to press on with their asylum requests in spite of the new rule.
The decision by Sessions came as the administration faced a growing backlash over immigration policies and practices that human-rights advocates view as inhumane, including separating children from immigrant parents. They leveled similar criticism over the asylum changes, which the White House says are necessary to deter illegal immigration.

“The mere fact that a country may have problems effectively policing certain crimes — such as domestic violence or gang violence — or that certain populations are more likely to be victims of crime, cannot itself establish an asylum claim,” the attorney general wrote Monday, overruling a Board of Immigration Appeals decision granting asylum to a Salvadoran woman fleeing her husband.
U.S. officials do not say how many asylum claims are for domestic or gang violence, but advocates for asylum seekers said there could be tens of thousands of such cases in the immigration court backlog alone.
Many Central Americans seeking asylum say they are fleeing from gangs known as “maras,” primarily the Mara Salvatrucha (or MS-13) and Barrio 18 groups. President Donald Trump has condemned those groups and the violence they commit in the U.S., referring to members as “animals.”
The gangs were formed by young Central Americans mostly in Los Angeles decades ago and spread to the so-called Northern Triangle countries of Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras when members were deported. Today, Honduras and El Salvador in particular routinely post some of the world’s highest homicide rates.
In Central America, maras stake out and battle over turf, attacking anyone who unwittingly crosses through their area on the way to school or work as a possible rival.
Gangsters sometimes forcibly take over people’s homes. They extort bus drivers and small business owners, killing those unable or unwilling to pay. They threaten teens and young men in attempts to recruit them, and force girls and young women to be their girlfriends.
Maureen Meyer, director for Mexico and migrant rights at the Washington Office on Latin America advocacy group, said the ruling would “make it very difficult for a lot of the people seeking asylum in the United States.”
Meyer said Central Americans commonly request asylum for extortion, forced recruitment and violence against women. Where the gangs are prevalent, moving elsewhere is not an option, she said.
“People feel very insecure in their homes and continue to see the U.S. as a safe haven in spite of Trump’s anti-immigrant rhetoric,” Meyer said of the steady northbound flow of Central Americans that began in 2014.

More than 100 asylum seekers gathered Wednesday near the entrance to San Diego, the largest crossing on the U.S.-Mexico border. Some Mexicans in the crowd said they were fleeing criminal groups.
Holding her 7-month-old daughter and trailed closely by her 5-year-old son, who was on crutches because of a gunshot wound, Maria Rafaela Plancarte said she abandoned their town near the western Mexican city of Zamora after her husband was shot and killed behind the wheel of the family car as they fled a party stormed by gunmen. Her son was wounded in the attack.
Plancarte, 34, said she has not considered moving elsewhere in Mexico and hopes to live with an aunt in California.
“I will feel more comfortable with a family that I know,” she said.
Alejandro Arroyo said he fled Apatzingan in western Mexico with his wife and their 14-year-old son, hoping asylum would bring them to his wife’s family in Gilroy, California. The 48-year-old said criminal gangs killed his nephew and brother-in-law, and he feared he and his son would be next.
They initially sought refuge in Tijuana, but requested U.S. asylum after being robbed by local police.
“I do not feel safe” in Apatzingan, Arroyo said, “and I do not feel safe here.”
Aparicio, from El Salvador, is caught in the middle of the change in asylum policies. His wife requested asylum about a month ago with three of their children – ages 2, 10 and 12 – and they were released to a family in Maryland while their cases wind through immigration court. Aparicio stayed in Tijuana to seek asylum with his 17-year-old son, hoping to reunite with the family later.
Sessions subsequently made his ruling on gang violence, but Aparicio is still pursuing asylum and hoping to get into the U.S.

But since the Trump administration rolled out its so-called “zero-tolerance” policy last month, separation of parents from their children has become a more routine part of the process.
Here’s why. Critical to this change is the administration’s decision to call for the criminal prosecution of all adults who illegally cross into the United States. According to existing U.S. immigration enforcement procedure, when a parent is referred for prosecution, the adult is sent to a federal jail and any children are placed in the care of an adult sponsor or, if no close family member or other adult is available to sponsor the child, to a shelter.
Former President Barack Obama also faced criticism for his administration’s use of family detention centers, especially amid the 2014 surge of Central American migrants arriving at the border, often fleeing violence in their home countries.
The federal government has released some preliminary data on family separation in the weeks following the Trump administration’s new policy but the full impact on families at the border is not immediately clear. (More on this data below.)
What follows is a timeline that details how the Trump administration came to embrace this policy.
Amid a flurry of executive actions that dealt with the border wall, so-called “sanctuary cities,” and a travel ban that targeted Muslim-majority countries, reports start to emerge that the Department of Homeland Security was discussing the possibility of implementing a policy of separating children from their parents at the border. Sources tell Reuters in early March 2017 that the Trump administration’s goal is to deter mothers from bringing their children on the oftentimes perilous journey to the U.S. border. When CNN asks then-DHS Secretary John Kelly about the potential policy days later, he said, “Yes I’m considering, in order to deter more movement along this terribly dangerous network. I am considering exactly that.”
Weeks later, after facing criticism for the comments, the DHS head appears to walk back the statement.
The idea of a family-separation proposal never quite went away, a source familiar with the discussions among Department of Homeland Security officials tells The New Yorker. A proposal for family separation keeps coming up in discussions on broader measures targeting illegal border crossings. “It would rear its head again,” the person said.
The Trump administration starts to increase prosecutions of illegal entry in October, according to a data analysis by The New York Times. The newspaper also finds that from October 2017 to April 2018, 700 families were separated at the border, including at least 100 children under age 4. This data was not known until the Times published its report months later, on April 20, 2018. A DHS spokesman tells the Times that the agency does not separate families at the border as a means to deter illegal immigration. The statement appears to contradict Kelly’s previous comments in which he said he was considering a family-separation proposal as part of a broader deterrence effort.
The Senate votes to confirm Kirstjen Nielsen as the new Department of Homeland Security secretary. Nielsen replaces Kelly, who became President Donald Trump’s chief of staff.
Attorney General Jeff Sessions announces in early April that anyone “illegally entering this country will not be rewarded, but will instead be met with the full prosecutorial powers of the Department of Justice.” In a memo, Sessions directs U.S. attorneys offices in southwest states along the border to prosecute all cases flagged for illegal entry, “to the extent practicable.”
Following his April directive Sessions announces a “zero-tolerance” policy for illegal entry into the U.S.: “If you cross this border unlawfully, then we will prosecute you. It’s that simple,” he said. According to the policy, any migrant crossing the border beyond the official ports of entry will face criminal prosecution, including asylum seekers with children.

Sessions continues: “If you smuggle illegal aliens across our border, then we will prosecute you. If you are smuggling a child, then we will prosecute you and that child will be separated from you as required by law.” He adds: “So if you’re going to come to this country, come here legally. Don’t come here illegally.”
The administration also says it had tested its “zero-tolerance” policy as part of a pilot program in the El Paso, Texas, area from July to November 2017. Administration officials say the program led to fewer families attempting to illegally cross into the U.S., effectively acting as a deterrent. Vox’s Dara Lind, however, points out that the statistic officials used to make that claim was faulty. The administration says border crossings at the El Paso sector dropped by 64 percent. But Lind finds the opposite: that federal data showed an increase of illegal border crossings during that time.
Nielsen tells a Senate committee that the Trump administration has been ramping up prosecutions of illegal border crossers, and not focusing on family separation. “We do not have a policy to separate children from their parents. Our policy is, if you break the law, we will prosecute you,” she says in her testimony.
A U.S. Customs and Border Patrol official tells a Senate committee that 638 adults who arrived at the border with 658 children have been prosecuted within the two weeks since Sessions announced the new “zero-tolerance” policy. It’s not immediately clear how many of the 638 children were separated from their parents.
A Reuters report published on June 8, 2018, says that nearly 1,800 families have been separated by border agents between October 2016 and February 2018. If that’s indeed the case, the Trump administration would have installed this type of policy earlier than previously thought. The exact origins on when the Trump administration rolled out this policy have not been cleared up by federal officials.
While speaking in Fort Wayne, Indiana, Sessions defended the “zero tolerance” policy by citing the Bible. “I would cite you to the Apostle Paul and his clear and wise command in Romans 13, to obey the laws of the government because God has ordained them for the purpose of order,” Session said. “Orderly and lawful processes are good in themselves and protect the weak and lawful.”
When asked about Sessions’ comment later that day, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders repeatedly told reporters that family separation was happening because of existing laws, “and the president is simply enforcing them.” Again, that’s not true. There’s no law mandating that.
During a briefing call today, Homeland Security officials confirmed to reporters that 1,995 children were separated from 1,940 adults at the U.S.-Mexico border from April 19 through May 31. These adults were referred for prosecution after illegally crossing the border.
Members of the Trump administration doubled down on the separation of children from their parents at the border after a weekend of growing criticism over the practice. Homeland Security’s Nielsen said officials will not offer an apology for enforcing the country’s immigration laws.
Attorney General Sessions said if officials didn’t enforce the laws, they would “encourage hundreds of thousands of people year to likewise ignore our laws and illegally enter our country.” Trump said this was “very strongly the Democrats’ fault.” All three have pointed to a law that mandates family separation, but no such law exists.
Trump signed an executive order that aims to end the separation of children from their parents when they’re detained for trying to cross the U.S.-Mexico border illegally. The day before, House Republicans introduced proposals with a similar goal, but Democrats wouldn’t support it, saying Trump could end family separation through executive order.
The order says the government will detain migrant families together throughout “criminal proceedings for improper entry or any removal or other immigration proceedings.” But Trump added that the executive order would not end his administration’s “zero-tolerance” policy of prosecuting immigrants for crossing the border illegally.
Along with addressing family separation, the order directs the Secretary of Defense to make existing military facilities available to house migrant families if necessary.
The order also asks Attorney General Sessions to file a formal request to modify the “Flores agreement,” which set standards on how minors are treated while in federal custody. The DOJ has yet to make this request. Members of the Trump administration has falsely claimed that the Flores agreement, which stems from a 1980s case over the mistreatment of unaccompanied minors, forced them to separate families at the border.
The Democratic attorneys general in 17 states, including New York, California and Virginia, filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, saying that their family separation policy is a “cruel and unlawful” practice. The lawsuit, filed with the U.S. District Court in Seattle, is believed to be the first legal challenge over Trump’s policy.
In a separate legal action, immigrant advocates requested that a federal judge in Los Angeles order the release of parents separated from their children at the border. The Justice Department did not respond to either legal action.
This is a developing post. We’ll continue to update.

Carlos Curbelo is “a decent man, a family man.” He lauds the South Florida Republican for defiantly pushing his party to protect young “Dreamer” immigrants from deportation.
Founder of a nonprofit that helps farm workers, Garza happily hosted Curbelo at a reception honoring high school graduates last week at the massive Homestead-Miami Speedway. But his praise came with a warning about this November’s elections.
“He better do what’s right for the community,” said Garza, 70, himself a former migrant laborer. “If not, he can lose.”
Across the country — from California’s lush Central Valley to suburban Denver to Curbelo’s district of strip malls, farms and the laid-back Florida Keys — moderate Republicans like Curbelo are under hefty pressure to buck their party’s hardline stance on immigration. After years of watching their conservative colleagues in safe districts refuse to budge, the GOP middle is fighting back — mindful that a softer position may be necessary to save their jobs and GOP control of the House.
“Members who have priorities and feel passionate about issues can’t sit back and expect leaders” to address them, Curbelo said. “Because it doesn’t work.”
Curbelo, 38, is seeking a third term from a district that stretches from upscale Miami suburbs to the Everglades and down to eccentric Key West. Seventy percent of his constituents are Hispanic and nearly half are foreign-born. Those are among the highest percentages in the nation, giving many of them a first-hand stake in Congress’ immigration fight.
Curbelo and Rep. Jeff Denham, R-Calif., whose Modesto-area district thrives on agriculture powered by migrant workers, have launched a petition drive that would force House votes on four immigration bills, ranging from liberal to conservative versions. Twenty-three Republicans have signed on, two shy of the number needed to succeed, assuming all Democrats jump aboard.
Another supporter of the rare rebellion by the usually compliant moderates is Rep. Mike Coffman, R-Colo., a former Marine who learned Spanish when his district was redrawn to include Denver’s diverse eastern suburbs. In an interview, Coffman expressed frustration over waiting nearly 18 months for House Speaker Paul Ryan to deliver on assurances that Congress would address the issue.
“He was always telling me, ‘It will happen, it will happen.’ I never saw it happen,” Coffman said. “One cannot argue that those of us who signed onto this discharge petition didn’t give leadership time.”
The centrists favor legislation that would protect from deportation hundreds of thousands of immigrants brought to the U.S. illegally as children. They back a path to citizenship for these immigrants, who have lived in limbo since President Donald Trump ended the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, called DACA. Federal courts have blocked its termination for now.
Trying to head off the petition, Ryan, R-Wis., and conservatives are negotiating with the centrists in hopes of finding compromise. Roll calls are on track for later this month, but it will be tough to steer legislation through the House that’s both liberal enough to survive in the more moderate Senate and restrictive enough for Trump to sign into law.
At the speedway, a local economic anchor since Hurricane Andrew shattered the city in 1992, Curbelo didn’t mention his battle in Washington to the graduates. “Our country and our community need you,” he told his audience, some of whom Garza said were DACA recipients.
Curbelo’s district backed Democrat Hillary Clinton by a whopping 16 percentage points in the 2016 presidential race over Trump, who has fanned immigrants’ resentment by repeatedly linking them to crime and job losses. That’s left Curbelo facing a competitive re-election, though he’s raised far more campaign cash than his likely Democratic challenger, Debbie Mucarsel-Powell.
Of the 23 Republican petition signees, nine represent districts whose Hispanic populations exceed the 18 percent national average. Clinton carried 12 of their districts in 2016, and several are from moderate-leaning suburbs of cities like Philadelphia and Minneapolis and agricultural areas in California and upstate New York that rely on migrant workers.
The centrists’ petition echoes the hardball tactics often employed by the hard-right House Freedom Caucus. Its roughly 30 members often band together with demands top Republicans ignore at peril of losing votes in the narrowly divided House.
GOP leaders and Freedom Caucus members fear that under the votes the petition would force, liberal-leaning legislation backed by most Democrats and a few Republicans would prevail. That would infuriate conservative voters who’ll be needed at the polls to fend off a Democratic wave threatening GOP House control.
Among those envisioning that scenario is Nicholas Mulick, GOP chairman of Florida’s Monroe County, which encompasses the Keys and is the reddest portion of Curbelo’s district. “With the greatest respect for the congressman, I don’t think it’s going to work,” Mulick said.
Others reject that argument, saying moderates’ worries should be heeded because they must be re-elected for Republicans to retain their majority.
“That sounds like somebody who’s never run in a swing district,” former Rep. Tom Davis, R-Va., who once led his party’s House campaign arm, said of claims that immigration votes would dampen conservative turnout. “Do they want to be in the majority, hold gavels?”
Democrats and local immigration activists say they wish Curbelo’s effort well but question his motivation. They say he’s reacting to election pressures and simply wants to show voters he’s fighting for them.
“It feels very late, opportunistic, theatrical,” said Thomas Kennedy, deputy political director for the Florida Immigrant Coalition.
Many at the speedway event, sponsored by Garza’s Mexican-American Council, were sympathetic to Curbelo’s battle in Washington, signaling the type of support he’ll need to be re-elected.
Rosa Castillo, 51, of nearby Florida City, said she knows people who don’t get driver’s licenses for fear of having their residency challenged. “He’s doing an awesome job for our DACA people,” said Castillo, a Democrat who said she’ll back Curbelo.
“He’s aware of our issues in our community,” said Pedro Sifuentes, 45, an independent from Homestead.
That sentiment isn’t universally shared. Over breakfast at a nearby Cracker Barrel restaurant, retiree and Trump backer Randy Nichols, 73, said he won’t support Curbelo.
“If they’re illegal, they need to leave. I hate to say that, but even for DACA kids,” said Nichols, who lives in Marathon, one of the Keys.
Mucarsel-Powell, Curbelo’s likely Democratic challenger, said in an interview that she was glad he’d “finally found some strength” to take on fellow Republicans.
The former state Senate candidate, an immigrant from Ecuador, said Curbelo’s challenge to GOP leaders “will obviously bring some positive attention.”
She said she hopes Curbelo and his supporters “aren’t doing it for political reasons.”

It was a response to reports that the Trump administration “lost” nearly 1,500 unaccompanied migrant children that the government had placed in the homes of sponsors. But the hashtag also became a catchall for outrage over the administration’s “zero-tolerance” policy against families who cross in the U.S. illegally, which according to Attorney General Jeff Sessions, includes separating children from their parents at the border.
The 1,500 figure first surfaced in April, when a top official from the Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the care of unaccompanied minors, disclosed at a Senate subcommittee hearing that 1,475 out of 7,635 children the agency tried to reach over a period of three months could not be accounted for in the agency’s follow-up welfare checks.
Separately, some immigration advocates have pointed to new HHS data that indicates the number of migrant children taken into U.S. custody has surged by 21 percent in the past month as evidence that border agents are more frequently separating parents from their children at the border. The Trump administration said the focus of its recent crackdown is on illegal border crossings, not separating families.
It’s not immediately clear how Trump’s policies are affecting children who arrive at the border alone, or those who are being separated from their parents. But here’s what we know about how both groups of minors are treated when they try to enter the country.
Amna Nawaz explains what we really know about minors who have been separated from their parents, or who arrive at the border alone.
Children arriving at the U.S.-Mexico border alone are detained by U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents and put in detention facilities. The government formally classifies them as “unaccompanied alien children” — those under 18 without a lawful immigration status who have no parent in the U.S., or no parent or legal guardian to provide physical custody. This triggers a few legal protections as they move through the immigration system.
Under federal law, the temporary detention, care and placement of unaccompanied children falls in the hands of the Department of Homeland Security and the Office of Refugee Resettlement, a division of Health and Human Services. Unaccompanied minors from Mexico and Canada go through a screening and repatriation process at the border. Children from other countries, however, are placed into one of about 100 shelters nationwide while they work their way through the immigration system.
The shelters, run by nonprofit organizations backed by federal grants, are responsible for assessing the child’s needs and providing services such as medical care and classroom education. They are also tasked with finding and screening suitable adult “sponsors,” which include parents or friends of family who can take custody of the child in the U.S. Upon release to a sponsor, the children are directed to pro bono attorneys who can represent them in deportation proceedings.
How many children has the agency processed?
The U.S. has seen some surges of children at the border in recent years, most notably in 2014, when the government apprehended 47,000 unaccompanied minors in the first five months of the year. The government has not said how many children have been filtered through this system since the Trump’s administration’s recent “zero-tolerance policy.” But, overall, HHS said this week that 10,773 migrant children were under the agency’s care. That’s up from 8,886 in April.

In April, Sessions announced a “zero-tolerance” policy toward illegal immigration, vowing to prosecute anyone caught crossing the border illegally. For children traveling with their parents, the new policy means that they will be separated at the border and taken into government custody while their parents are placed in federal jails.
Within 13 days of instituting this policy, 658 children were separated from their parents, according to a Customs and Border Protection official who testified at a Senate hearing last week. While these children did not arrive at the border alone, they are essentially rendered unaccompanied by the government when they are separated from their parents and taken in by Health and Human Services.
The president himself has blamed Democrats for an existing law that separates families at the border. But no current law actually mandates this, according to Politifact.
After a child is placed with a sponsor, and while they await deportation proceedings, the government conducts a one-time welfare check by phone.
In a statement on Monday, Health and Human Services Deputy Secretary Eric Hargan said this was an “additional step” not required of the agency, and that a lack of response from sponsors does not mean a child is lost, but might opt to not pick up phone calls fear of being deported.
“The reason many sponsors cannot be reached is because they themselves are illegal aliens and do not want to be reached by federal authorities,” he said.
But there are broader issues with how unaccompanied children are handled, a problem that predates the Trump administration, according to a 2015 report issued by a congressional watchdog group, which called the interagency process to be “inefficient and vulnerable to error.”
Among the problems cited in that report by the U.S. Government Accountability Office: federal officials weren’t properly identifying and screening potential sponsors before releasing children to them.
At the Senate hearing on the issue in late April, Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, also cited a 2014 case in his home state in which the agency released eight Guatemalan teens to traffickers. Officials failed to “respond to red flags,” Portman said — namely, that sponsors who were sponsoring several unaccompanied minors may be involved in human trafficking. Frontline examined this case and others for its “Trafficked in America” documentary.
The trafficking case prompted a congressional investigation and hearing into the child placement process, and the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations tasked the two agencies with coming up with a clearer delineation of their roles. More than two years later, a plan has yet to be finalized, a fact that angered Portman, who noted that the agencies “blew past” their original deadline.
“We care because these kids regardless of their immigration status deserve to be properly treated, not abused or trafficked,” he said.
Some other issues:
There’s not a ‘clear path’ on how to safeguard children once they are released to sponsors
While the process for transferring detained children into shelters is guided by laws meant to protect them, such as the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008, what happens to unaccompanied children after they are released to sponsors is far less clear, said Jessica Ramos, a lawyer with Advocates for Basic Legal Equality in Ohio.
Other than Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which contacts the children with a notice to appear in immigration court, no state or local entities are notified when children are placed with sponsors in their communities.
Steven Wagner, the acting assistant secretary at Health and Human Services, has said the agency does not have “additional legal responsibility” for minors after they are relocated with sponsors, and has suggested at-risk children be entrusted to local child protection agencies.
Some lawmakers have agreed that more involvement from local agencies would be a step in the right direction, but Ramos said some advocates see that approach as a double-edged sword.
“I think the idea is that all these organizations would step up and help, but realistically that’s not always what we see on the ground,” she said. “Especially in some rural areas where there may not be a large immigrant population or where there may be some anti-immigrant sentiment.”
Legal representation is not a guarantee
Immigration hearings are a critical moment for checking if children are where they are supposed to be when they get released from custody. Yet according to Kathryn Larin of the Government Accountability Office, who testified in a hearing last month, 58 percent of children have failed to show up at their hearings so far in 2018.
Attorneys are supposed to play an important role in the process by helping ensure that children comply with immigration court proceedings and do not fall off the radar. Lawyers can also offer children another adult to rely on, when a sponsor is not fulfilling their responsibilities.
But nearly 29 percent of unaccompanied children whose cases began in 2015 are still without legal representation, and that number jumps to 76 percent for children whose cases began last year, according to Syracuse University’s TRAC database, which compiles statistics on the issue. While every child has a right to representation, few have the financial resources to hire an attorney and the law only requires Health and Human Services to ensure legal representation “to the greatest extent practicable” — which in many cases simply involves giving the children and their sponsors a list of pro bono lawyers.
The availability of post-release services is improving, but still limited
All children receive phone calls 30 days after being placed with a sponsor to check on their safety and well-being. But only children deemed vulnerable, including those who have been released to non-relative sponsors, receive further support from the refugee office.
“By the time I meet with my clients, ORR has abdicated all responsibility for them,” Ramos said at the Senate hearing last month. She has represented more than 400 unaccompanied children throughout Ohio since 2008 and said she has only seen a handful of her clients receive post-release services.
The number of children receiving post-release services, which may range from medical care to family counseling, has increased in recent years. According to the GAO, fewer than 10 percent of children in 2014 received these services. That number has jumped to 32 percent in 2017. Yet Ramos sees a need for more access to services, especially for teenagers who might experience a rocky transition when placed with family members or parents they have not seen in years.
Limited funding makes providing the full range of services difficult, said Katie Kuennen of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, a group that relies largely on federal funding from the refugee office.
“Only a small percentage of the kids had that sort of safety net and monitoring,” Kuennen said of the children she’s worked with.
A spokesman for Portman’s office told the PBS NewsHour that Health and Human Services and the Department of Homeland Security have said they would complete an outline for improving the placement process by July 30.
When contacted by the NewsHour, neither agency offered specific details on what the outline might include.
Acting Director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement Thomas Homan says he sees a lot of sad situations with parents being separated from children, but he has a job to do.
The Trump administration has proposed several changes to how the U.S. handles unaccompanied minors trying to enter the country, including those it says would make it easier to detain and deport migrant children and harder for those children to seek asylum.
The “crisis” at the border is “the exclusive product of loopholes in federal immigration law that Democrats refuse to close,” White House senior adviser Stephen Miller said in a conference call Tuesday with reporters.
For months, the administration has argued that children who arrive at the border by themselves but have a parent in the U.S. with whom they can be reunified should not be given “unaccompanied” status. According to the Washington Post, proposed regulations being drafted by the Justice and Homeland Security departments would officially change how this designation is granted, by giving immigration judges more discretion in deciding whether a child deserves the status and the special legal protections it comes with.

The White House on Tuesday wrongly blamed Democrats for forcing Trump’s administration to separate children from parents. Liberal activists and others, including some from media outlets, tried to highlight the issue by tweeting photos of young people in steel cages that actually were taken during the Obama administration. Others seized on reports the government had “lost” more than 1,000 children, though that wasn’t quite the case.
It all comes just in time for the midterm elections as Republicans and Democrats try to rally core voters by pointing fingers at one another. Trump won the presidency promising to build a wall along the southern border and end illegal immigration, and the White House believes stressing the same issues will drive voters to the polls and help the GOP hang on to their majorities in the Senate and House.
The White House is “really beating the immigration drum in the lead-up to the midterm elections as a rallying cry and as a way of mobilizing voter support for Trump and the candidates that he chooses,” said Doris Meissner, a senior fellow at the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute and former commissioner of the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service during the Clinton administration. “It does seem to provoke a ratcheting up across the board.”
Indeed, the situation grew so hostile over the holiday weekend that the president’s elder daughter, White House adviser Ivanka Trump, came under fire for tweeting a photo of herself and her youngest son in their pajamas Sunday morning.
“Focus on what is before you, on what you can control and ignore the trolls!” she later wrote.
During a White House conference call Tuesday, senior adviser Stephen Miller contended “the current immigration and border crisis” is “the exclusive product of loopholes in federal immigration law that Democrats refuse to close.”
That was after Trump lit up social media over the weekend by falsely claiming there was a “horrible law” that separates children from their parents after they cross the border illegally. He had said previously that “we have to break up families” at the border because “the Democrats gave us that law.”
But there’s no law mandating that parents must be separated from their children, and it’s not a policy Democrats have pushed or can change alone as the minority in Congress. The tactic’s increased use is being driven by Trump’s administration, which recently announced a new “zero-tolerance policy” in which it will press criminal charges against all people crossing the border illegally, even if they have few or no previous offenses. More children are expected to be separated from their parents as a result.
Marc Short, White House Director Of Legislative Affairs, joins Judy Woodruff to discuss President Trump’s agenda, including a potential deal with the huge Chinese tech firm ZTE, the financial effects of the GOP tax cut, reports that migrant children are being separated from their parents and abused, and GOP divisions in the House of Representatives.
A Customs and Border Protection official told lawmakers last week that 658 children had been separated from their parents at the border from May 6 to May 19 as the parents face charges. That’s in addition to hundreds more who were estimated to have been removed from their parents since October.
The practice has drawn condemnation from Trump critics, who have long accused him of supporting inhumane policies in his efforts to crack down on illegal immigration.
“He actually called the practice horrible. If he thinks it’s so horrible then he ought to just end it and not make the children a negotiating tool,” said Lee Gelernt, deputy director of the American Civil Liberties Union’s Immigrants’ Rights Project.
“It’s never a good idea to separate small children from their parents,” said Rep. Carlos Curbelo, R-Fla. “I cannot defend that, nor do I wish to.”
Curbelo is a leader of GOP lawmakers trying to force House immigration votes next month over leaders’ objections.
Trump foes made their own missteps in the debate.
Over the weekend, some critics of the policy tweeted photos of young-looking immigrants at the U.S.-Mexico border in steel cages and blamed the Trump administration for separating immigrant children from their parents. The problem: The photos were taken by The Associated Press in 2014, when Barack Obama was in office, and the photo captions reference children who crossed the border as unaccompanied minors.
How or why the story resurfaced on social media four years after it was published was unclear. But Trump seized on the error.
“Democrats mistakenly tweet 2014 pictures from Obama’s term showing children from the Border in steel cages. They thought it was recent pictures in order to make us look bad, but backfires,” Trump tweeted Tuesday. “Dems must agree to Wall and new Border Protection for good of country … Bipartisan Bill!”

It’s unclear what “Bipartisan Bill!” Trump might have been referring to.
Congress is heading toward an immigration showdown in the House as Republican moderates force a June vote on legislation to protect young “Dreamer” immigrants and beef up border security.
GOP leaders are trying to stop the bill, which has robust support from Democrats and some Republicans. They’re worried any legislation that smacks of “amnesty” for immigrants in the U.S. illegally would dampen conservative enthusiasm ahead of the midterms.
Instead, House Speaker Paul Ryan and his leadership team are trying to put together an alternative approach that most Republicans would support. But finding common ground remains difficult. Trump so far has not engaged in the Capitol Hill debate, even as he repeatedly insists Congress must act.
Also making the rounds on social media over the holiday weekend: Allegations that children placed in custody have been “lost” by federal authorities, which officials say isn’t the case.
The allegation, which sparked #WhereAreOurChildren on Twitter, grew out of testimony in April by a federal official that the government had lost track of nearly 1,500 unaccompanied minor children it placed with adult sponsors in the U.S.
An official from the Health and Human Services Department told a congressional hearing last month that his department placed follow-up phone calls from October to December to U.S. households that were sponsoring minors who crossed the border without their parents. They reached 86 percent of the children or sponsors, but the department could not verify the whereabouts of 1,475. In some cases, sponsors simply didn’t respond to the follow-up phone call, not surprising because many are themselves in the U.S. illegally and reluctant to speak to authorities.
“If you call a friend and they don’t answer the phone, you don’t assume that they’ve been kidnapped,” HHS’ Steven Wagner said.
Officials said Tuesday they are planning more thorough screening of both minors and their sponsors, including a fingerprint background check of every sponsor.

https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/republican-chaos-on-immigration-shows-issues-risks-for-gop,migrant,821,2018-05-19T11:48:16-04:00,"Alan Fram, Associated Press",Republican chaos on immigration shows issue’s risks for GOP,"WASHINGTON — The chaos among House Republicans this past week on immigration shows just how problematic and risky the issue is for a party that badly needs unity heading into the elections in November that will decide control of Congress.
GOP leaders thought they had found a way by Friday morning to make the party’s warring conservative and moderate wings happy on an issue that has bedeviled them for years.
Conservatives would get a vote by late June on an immigration bill that parrots many of President Donald Trump’s hard-right immigration views, including reductions on legal immigration and opening the door to his proposed wall with Mexico. Centrists would have a chance to craft a more moderate alternative with the White House and Democrats and get a vote on that, too.
But it all blew up as conservatives decided they didn’t like that offer and rebelled. By lunchtime Friday, many were among the 30 Republicans who joined Democrats and scuttled a sweeping farm and food bill, a humiliating setback for the House’s GOP leaders, particularly for lame-duck Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis.
The conservatives essentially took the agriculture bill hostage.
They said they were unwilling to let the farm measure pass unless they first got assurances that when the House addresses immigration in coming weeks, leaders would not help an overly permissive version pass.
Rep. Jeff Denham, R-Calif., a leader of the moderates, said his group would try to write a bill that would let young “Dreamer” immigrants in the U.S. illegally stay permanently — a position anathema to conservatives — and toughen border security.
A moderate immigration package “disavows what the last election was about and what the majority of the American people want, and the people in this body know it,” said Rep. Scott Perry, R-Pa. He’s a member of the hard-right House Freedom Caucus, many of whose members opposed the farm bill.
“It’s all about timing unfortunately and leverage, and the farm bill was just a casualty, unfortunately,” Perry said.

Denham and his allies were also unwilling to back down. He told reporters that the conservatives “broke that agreement,” and his group would pursue bipartisan legislation.
“I’m disappointed in some colleagues who asked for a concession, got the concession and then took down a bill anyway,” Denham said in a slap at the Freedom Caucus. Denham said the concession was a promised vote on the conservative immigration bill by June, though conservatives said they never agreed to that.
Such internal bickering is the opposite of what the GOP needs as the party struggles to fend off Democratic efforts to capture House control in November. Democrats need to gain 23 seats to win a majority, and a spate of Democratic special election victories and polling data suggests they have a solid chance of achieving that.
Republican leaders and strategists think their winning formula is to focus on an economy that has been gaining strength and tax cuts the GOP says is putting more money in people’s wallets.
Immigration is a distraction from that message — and worse.
On one side are conservatives from Republican strongholds, where many voters consider helping immigrants stay in the U.S. to be amnesty. On the other are GOP moderates, often representing districts with many constituents who are Hispanic, moderate suburbanites or are tied to the agriculture industry, which relies heavily on migrant workers.
A look at the 20 Republicans who have signed a petition by GOP moderates aimed at forcing House votes on four immigration bills is instructive.
Of the 20, nine are from districts whose Hispanic populations exceed 18 percent, the proportion of the entire U.S. that is Hispanic. Denham’s Central California district is 40 percent Hispanic, while five others’ constituencies are at least two-thirds Hispanic.
In addition, 11 of the 20 represent districts that Democrat Hillary Clinton carried over Trump in the 2016 presidential election.
The petition drive, led by Denham and GOP Rep. Carlos Curbelo, whose South Florida district is 70 percent Hispanic, is opposed by party leaders because the winning bill probably would be a compromise backed by all Democrats and a few dozen Republicans. That would enrage conservatives, perhaps prompting a rebellion that could cost House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., his goal of succeeding Ryan as speaker.
All that trouble would be for legislation that still faces long odds of becoming law.
Even if a formula is discovered that could pass the House, it could run aground in the Senate, where four immigration bills died in February and Democrats can use the filibuster to scuttle any bill they dislike. Those defeats led Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., to say he wouldn’t revisit immigration unless a bill arose that could actually pass this chamber.
Trump’s willingness to sign immigration legislation also remains in question after a year that has seen his stance on the issue veer unpredictably."
https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/next-steps-for-caravan-will-unfold-mostly-out-of-public-view,migrant,698,2018-05-02T08:57:02-04:00,"Elliot Spagat, Associated Press",Next steps for caravan will unfold mostly out of public view,"TIJUANA, Mexico — The caravan of Central Americans seeking asylum in the United States sought the world’s attention as scores of migrants traveled through Mexico on a journey to escape their violent homelands.
Now that the group has arrived at the border, the next steps in their journey will unfold mostly out of public view.
The caravan first drew attention in the U.S. when President Donald Trump promised that his administration would seek to turn the families away. The rest of the asylum-seeking process will happen slowly and secretively in immigration courts.
Dan Kowalski, editor of Bender’s Immigration Bulletin, said the public will “probably see very little (of the caravan cases) unless the applicant is represented and the attorney makes an effort to bring the client into the limelight.”
A total of 28 caravan members were accepted for processing Monday and Tuesday by U.S. border inspectors at San Diego’s San Ysidro crossing, an official with U.S. Customs and Border Protection said. The crossing, the nation’s busiest, processed about 50 asylum seekers a day from October through February, suggesting the wait will be short.

Under U.S. asylum practices, people spend up to three days at the border inspection facility before being transferred to a long-term detention center. An asylum officer interviews them for an initial screening, usually within a week or so, to determine if their cases should advance to immigration court, which can take several years.
The courts often conduct business behind closed doors. Files are not public, and, unlike criminal or civil courts, access for journalists and others is limited.
The caravan’s numbers, while tiny compared to previous surges of Central Americans to South Texas and Haitians to San Diego, will be a test of Trump’s tough words. Administration officials have railed against what they call legal loopholes and “catch-and-release” policies that allow people seeking asylum to be freed while their cases are adjudicated, but any significant changes must be addressed by Congress or in the courts.
Attorney General Jeff Sessions has pledged to send more immigration judges to the border if needed and threatened criminal prosecution. On Monday, the Justice Department said it filed illegal-entry charges against 11 people identified as caravan members.

Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen said asylum claims will be resolved “efficiently and expeditiously.” She also warned that anyone making false claims could be prosecuted and said asylum seekers should seek protection in the first safe country they reach, including Mexico.
U.S. attorneys who counseled asylum seekers in Tijuana warned that they could be separated from family and spend many months in detention, a shift from the Obama administration.
Separating asylum-seeking families has become more common, as has detaining them while their cases wind through the courts, said Leon Rodriguez, director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service from 2014 to 2017, which oversees asylum petitions.
The U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency has limited beds in family detention centers and may also choose to release adults and their children while their cases wind through the system, often with orders that some of them wear ankle monitors. Children traveling alone are placed with family, other sponsors or in group homes overseen by the Health and Human Services Department.
Nearly 80 percent of asylum-seekers passed the initial screening from October through December, but few are likely to win asylum, which requires the petitioner to show well-founded fear of persecution on grounds of race, religion, nationality, political beliefs or membership in a social group.
The denial rate for El Salvadorans seeking asylum was 79 percent from 2012 to 2017, according to Syracuse University’s Transactional Records Action Clearinghouse. Hondurans were close behind with a 78 percent denial rate, followed Guatemalans at 75 percent.

The caravan, which traveled through Mexico from Central America and reached the U.S. border over the weekend, includes an estimated 150 migrants who are seeking asylum status out of fear of persecution in their home countries.
President Donald Trump has been openly critical of asylum, tweeting his concerns over what he says are lax immigration laws that improperly allow immigrants into the country.
Here’s what you need to know about asylum law in the U.S.
What is asylum?
In 1948, the United Nations passed a declaration of human rights that recognized asylum as a method for immigrants to escape persecution in their home country. Three years later the U.S. participated in the UN’s Refugee Convention of 1951, which established the legal framework for protecting refugees. Asylum seekers gained formal protections under U.S. law with the Refugee Act of 1980, which created a system for admitting refugees into the country.
Generally, asylum is meant to serve as a humanitarian protection under international law, said Cori Alonso-Yoder, an attorney who helps run the Immigrant Justice Clinic at American University.
“Most basically, people who seek asylum are afraid to return to their countries of origin, though the law requires that this fear meet certain standards for asylum to be granted,” she said.
People who are granted asylum status can apply for permanent residence after one year, obtain a social security card, and work lawfully in the country.
Who qualifies for asylum?
Under federal law, anyone from another country can seek asylum — and therefore entry into the U.S. — by claiming to have fled their countries out of fear of persecution over their race, religion, nationality, political opinion or membership in a particular social group. Immigrants are eligible to apply for asylum for up to one year after their entry into the U.S., and can apply whether they entered the country legally or illegally. Immigrants who have been in the country longer than one year can also apply for asylum status if they meet certain criteria, according to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, an agency of the Department of Homeland Security. More recently, asylum seekers have also been granted status due to their gender and sexual orientation.
Asylum seekers typically come from a wide range of cultural background and socioeconomic status, said Michelle Stilwell, a civil rights attorney.
“These are people that are overlooked by their own government, that can’t seek help in their own country,” Stilwell said. “So they’re literally coming here just to save their lives and to live in some sort of relative safety.”

Opponents, including Trump, have argued that immigrants take advantage of the system to gain entry into the U.S. “People come here and they put in a claim for political asylum without merit because it will get them to the United States,” said Ira Mehlman, the media director of the conservative Federation for American Immigration Reform.
To apply for asylum, applicants are required to file Form I-589, a 12-page document where they must describe the harm they face in their home country in detail. Then, asylum seekers, often with the help of attorneys, have to collect information — such as personal statements, letters from other people, medical reports and photographs — to support their case. That can be a difficult and time consuming process, Stilwell said.
“Anything you can show that will support your claim that you suffered abuse” helps applicants gain asylum, Stillwell said.
What’s changed?
Applications for asylum have increased in recent years. According to the Department of Homeland Security, the number of new asylum applications rose from 43,312 in fiscal year 2012 to 141,695 in fiscal year 2017. The rise in applications has changed the way asylum cases are processed in the courts, according to Victoria Slatton, an immigration attorney. After filing the application, asylum seekers join a waiting list to interview with an officer from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.
In the past, the process — from filing the application to receiving a final answer approving or rejecting the request — typically took roughly 60 days, Slatton said. But in recent years, “what used to be a 60-day waiting period became anywhere from a two- to five-year waiting period,” Slatton said.
The process changed again in January, when the Trump administration announced that it would prioritize processing recently-filed asylum applications over applications that have been pending for years. The new policy is often called “last in, first out.”
U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services has said the shift was made to eliminate the backlog of asylum cases. In a statement in January, the agency said the backlog had reached 311,000 pending asylum cases.
“Delays in the timely processing of asylum applications are detrimental to legitimate asylum seekers,” USCIS Director Francis Cissna said in the agency statement. “Lingering backlogs can be exploited and used to undermine national security and the integrity of the asylum system.”
The challenges
Some immigration lawyers say the change made it harder to assemble documentation on short notice for applicants whose cases get fast-tracked.
“Where I usually have a few years to put these cases together, I’ve only had a month, so right now I’m really scrambling,” Slatton said.

The pressure of assembling all the evidence needed to make a case on short notice can be “extremely, extremely, challenging,” Stilwell said. “ If you can’t collect enough evidence in time, you’re not going to get granted asylum.”
Language barriers also make the system difficult for people to navigate, Alonso-Yoder said. Many of her clients who struggle with English and understanding the U.S. legal system miss important deadlines for filing paperwork, she said.
Vicki Marroquin Vasquez, 32, didn’t know what asylum was when she immigrated to the U.S. from Guatemala in 2002.
When Vasquez applied for protections based on her sexual orientation and transgender status in 2010, she had difficulties telling her story because her first language is Mam, an indigenous Mayan language. In an interview, she said had to secure a translator and also explain why her application had been delayed.
“I didn’t know my own rights. I landed in a foreign country and couldn’t even order my own food,” said Vasquez, whose asylum application was approved in 2011.
Juan Fuentes, an El Salvadoran immigrant who was granted asylum status last year, described a years-long process marked by waiting and confusion. Still, Fuentes said he was grateful his case was heard before the new changes went into effect this year.
“When I came to this country, I wanted to be legal. I didn’t know how I’d do it, but I wanted status,” Fuentes said. “If I was still in El Salvador, I wouldn’t be alive.”
Correction: A previous version of this story incorrectly stated when Vicki Marroquin Vasquez applied for and obtained asylum status. Vazquez applied for asylum in 2010, and the application was approved in 2011."

Answering a reporter’s question Monday, Trump said he and Buhari did not talk about reports that he used a term for a filthy toilet when telling U.S. lawmakers that he wanted less immigration from certain countries in Africa and more from places like Norway.
Trump said Monday that there are “some countries that are in very bad shape and very tough places to live in.”
Buhari deflected, saying he was unsure about “whether that allegation against the president was true or not.”
Trump adds that he and Buhari didn’t discuss it “because the president knows me and he knows where I’m coming from.”
Trump also refused to apologize for his inflammatory rhetoric on immigration, even if it impacts the legal fortune of his travel ban.
The president said Monday at the news conference that he had nothing for which to apologize.
He also said he did not believe it would make any difference. The latest iteration of his travel ban is currently being considered by the Supreme Court.
Trump also said his administration was monitoring the progress of a caravan of migrants making its way north through Latin America toward the United States.
He declined to say how many of the migrants should be admitted to the U.S. but bemoaned the nation’s immigration laws as “the worst.”

President Donald Trump vowed last week to “stop” the caravan while Cabinet members said they would deliver a swift response. The asylum seekers held firm, setting up a possible showdown.
In an anticlimactic twist, about 50 asylum seekers were allowed past a gate controlled by Mexican officials to walk across a long bridge but were stopped at the entrance to the U.S. inspection facility at the other end. They were allowed to wait outside the building, technically on Mexican soil, without word of when U.S. officials would let them claim asylum.
Another 50 or so camped on blankets and backpacks in Tijuana outside the Mexican side of the crossing, prohibited from even getting close to the U.S. inspection building.
The asylum-seekers began the day with anticipation, traveling in red-and-white school buses under police escort to a beachfront rally in Tijuana, where a steel fence juts out into the Pacific Ocean. They sang the Honduran national anthem, and supporters on the San Diego side of the fence waved a Honduran flag.
After a final briefing from lawyers and minutes before they were to begin a short walk to the border crossing, U.S. Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Kevin McAleenan announced that the San Ysidro border crossing, the nation’s busiest, had “reached capacity” for people without legal documents and that asylum-seekers may need to wait in Mexico temporarily.
Trump has commented frequently on the caravan since it started in Mexico on March 25 near the Guatemala border and headed north to Tijuana. His broadsides came as his administration vowed to end what officials call “legal loopholes” and “catch-and-release” policies that allow people requesting asylum to be released from custody into the U.S. while their claims make their way through the courts, which can take years.
Attorney General Jeff Sessions has called the caravan “a deliberate attempt to undermine our laws and overwhelm our system.” Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen said asylum claims will be resolved “efficiently and expeditiously” and warned that anyone making false claims could be prosecuted.

The administration’s stern warnings left organizers in disbelief that border inspectors were not ready for them.
“They have been well aware that a caravan is going to arrive at the border,” Nicole Ramos, an attorney working on behalf of caravan members, said at a news conference. “The failure to prepare and failure to get sufficient agents and resources is not the fault of the most vulnerable among us. We can build a base in Iraq in under a week. We can’t process 200 refugees. I don’t believe it.”
The caravan that left the Guatemala-Mexico border in late March grew over the last month to more than 1,000 migrants who found safety travelling in numbers. Organizer Irineo Mujica said earlier in April that Mexico City was the caravan’s last official stop.
Some have decided to seek asylum in Mexico. But many of the migrants wanted to continue together on the final leg north and decided to keep travelling en masse. The caravan has also appeared to gain momentum from Trump’s comments and the publicity that followed.
The San Ysidro border inspection facility can hold about 300 people, according to Pete Flores, Customs and Border Protection’s San Diego field office director, suggesting the bottleneck may be short-lived. The agency processed about 8,000 asylum cases from October through February, or about 50 a day.
Asylum-seekers are typically held for up to three days at the border and then turned over to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. If they pass an asylum officer’s initial screening, they may be detained or released into the U.S. with ankle monitors.
Asylum seekers didn’t appear to be thrown off the by the delay.
Wendi Yaneri Garcia said she was confident she will be released while her asylum case is pending because she is traveling alone with her 2-year-old son, who has been sick. She said that police in her hometown of Atlantida, Honduras, jailed her for protesting construction of a hydroelectric plant and that she received death threats after being released.
“All I want is a place where I can work and raise my son,” the 36-year-old said.
Elin Orrellana, a 23-year-old pregnant woman from El Salvador, said she is fleeing the violent MS-13 street gang, a favorite target of both Sessions and Trump because of their brutal killings in communities in the United States. She said her older sister had been killed by the gang in El Salvador, so she is attempting to join other family members in the Kansas City area.
“Fighting on is worth it,” she said as she camped out for chilly night outside the border crossing."

They say they want to prepare them for the worst possible outcome.
“We are the bearers of horrible news,” Los Angeles lawyer Nora Phillips said during a break from legal workshops for the migrants at three Tijuana locations where about 20 lawyers gave free information and advice. “That’s what good attorneys are for.”
The Central Americans, many traveling as families, on Sunday will test the Trump administration’s tough rhetoric criticizing the caravan when the migrants begin seeking asylum by turning themselves in to border inspectors at San Diego’s San Ysidro border crossing, the nation’s busiest.
President Donald Trump and members of his Cabinet have been tracking the caravan, calling it a threat to the U.S. since it started March 25 in the Mexican city of Tapachula, near the Guatemala border. They have promised a stern, swift response.
Attorney General Jeff Sessions called the caravan “a deliberate attempt to undermine our laws and overwhelm our system,” pledging to send more immigration judges to the border to resolve cases if needed.
Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen said asylum claims will be resolved “efficiently and expeditiously” but said the asylum-seekers should seek it in the first safe country they reach, including Mexico.
Any asylum seekers making false claims to U.S. authorities could be prosecuted as could anyone who assists or coaches immigrants on making false claims, Nielsen said. Administration officials and their allies claim asylum fraud is growing and that many who seek it are coached on how to do so.
Kenia Elizabeth Avila, 35, appeared shaken after the volunteer attorneys told her Friday that temperatures may be cold in temporary holding cells and that she could be separated from her three children, ages 10, 9 and 4.
But she in said an interview that returning to her native El Salvador would be worse. She fled for reasons she declined to discuss.
“If they’re going to separate us for a few days, that’s better than getting myself killed in my country,” she said.
Since Congress failed to agree on a broad immigration package in February, administration officials have made it a legislative priority to end what they call “legal loopholes” and “catch-and-release” policies that allow asylum-seekers to be released from custody while their claims wind through the courts in cases that can last for year.
The lawyers who went to Tijuana denied coaching any of the roughly 400 people in the caravan who recently arrived in Tijuana, camping out in shelters near some of the city’s seedier bars and bordellos.
Some migrants received one-on-one counseling to assess the merits of their cases and groups of the migrants with their children playing nearby were told how asylum works in the U.S.
Asylum-seekers are typically held up to three days at the border and turned over to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. If they pass an asylum officer’s initial screening, they may be detained or released with ankle monitors.
Nearly 80 percent of asylum-seekers passed the initial screening from October through December, the latest numbers available, but few are likely to eventually win asylum.
Mexicans fared worst among the 10 countries that sent the largest numbers of U.S. asylum seekers from 2012 to 2017, with a denial rate of 88 percent, according to asylum outcome records tracked by Syracuse University’s Transactional Records Action Clearinghouse. El Salvadorans were close behind with a 79 percent denial rate, followed by Hondurans at 78 percent and Guatemalans at 75 percent.
Evelyn Wiese, a San Francisco immigration attorney, said she tried to make migrants more comfortable sharing memories of the dangers they faced in their homelands.
“It’s really scary to tell these experiences to a stranger,” Wiese said after counseling a visibly shaken Guatemalan woman at an art gallery in a building that used to house a drug smuggling tunnel into San Diego. “The next time she tells her story will be easier.”
Nefi Hernandez, who planned to seek asylum with his wife and infant daughter was born on the journey through Mexico, worried he could be kept in custody away from his daughter. But his spirits lifted when he learned he might be released with an ankle bracelet.
Hernandez, 24, said a gang in his hometown of San Pedro Sula, Honduras, threatened to kill him and his family if he did not sell drugs.
Jose Cazares, 31, said he faced death threats in the northern Honduran city of Yoro because a gang member suspected of killing the mother of his children learned one of Cazares’ sons reported the crime to police.
“One can always make up for lost time with a child, but if they kill him, you can’t,” he said outside his dome-shaped tent in a migrant shelter near the imposing U.S. border barriers separating San Diego from Tijuana."

Where do things stand?,"States have started complying with President Donald Trump’s request last week to send National Guard members to the U.S.-Mexico border, his latest move to strengthen security and reduce illegal immigration.
The governors of Texas and Arizona have deployed hundreds of troops to the border in recent days. California Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown said he would send roughly 400 National Guard troops to the border, but restrict them from enforcing “federal immigration laws” — a rebuke of Trump’s immigration policies.
The moves come one week after Trump vented about border security in a series of tweets, and then signed an order requesting the deployment of National Guard troops to the country’s Southern border. Days later, the White House confirmed plans to deploy an estimated 2,000 to 4,000 National Guard members to support federal agents along the border.
The order sent states along the southern border scrambling to decide if and how many troops they would send to meet Trump’s request. As the deployments ramp up, here’s what you need to know:
Why is this happening?
Trump’s deployment order represents another step toward fulfilling one of his core campaign promises: strengthening border security and reducing what he says is an influx of undocumented immigrants, drugs and crime.
The Trump administration has also proposed laws to make applying for and granting asylum more difficult and moved to end “catch and release,” which allows for immigrants that arrive at the border to be released from detention while they wait for their case to be heard.
Trump’s decision last week came as he expressed concern on Twitter over the caravan of several hundred Central American immigrants in Mexico heading towards the U.S. border.
According to media reports, the caravan was organized by the nonprofit group Pueblo Sin Fronteras to support Central American migrants seeking asylum in both Mexico and the United States.
What will the troops do?
States will manage the National Guard troops they deploy, though deployment is being funded by the federal government. It’s unclear what the cost of the total operation will be.
At a press conference last Thursday, the Pentagon clarified that the National Guard will aid with, “aviation, engineering, surveillance, communications, vehicle maintenance and logistical support.”

In an memo sent last Friday, Defense Secretary James Mattis approved funding to cover the deployment of up to 4,000 National Guard agents through Sept. 30. States can decide to allocate additional National Guard troops as time goes on.
What states are sending troops?
Texas Republican Gov. Greg Abbott was the first to respond to Trump’s request, ordering 250 National Guard agents to the border. On Monday, Abbott said he would send an additional 1,000 troops. Arizona Republican Gov. Doug Ducey has sent 225 agents, and might reportedly send an additional 113 troops. New Mexico has also expressed support for Trump’s plan.
Brown took a different approach in California, agreeing to send troops but expressing his displeasure with the politics surrounding Trump’s decision.
“This will not be a mission to build a new wall,” Brown wrote, referring to Trump’s oft-stated goal of building a border wall. “It will not be a mission to round up women and children or detain people escaping violence and seeking a better life.”
Governors in other states have also criticized Trump’s request. Nevada Republican Gov. Brian Sandoval (R), came out against the deployment order. Oregon Democratic Gov. Kate Brown took to Twitter to say she was “troubled” by Trump’s plan and would not send troops.
With border deployment, Trump joins Bush, Obama
This is not the first time National Guard troops have been deployed to the border. Presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush also sent troops to the border, with mixed results.
Bush deployed National Guard troops to the border in 2006. The deployment lasted two years and cost an estimated $1.2 billion. After the mission, Army National Guard Commander Maj. David M. Church said both the National Guard and DHS did not communicate effectively and had little time for preparation.
Obama’s deployment, called Operation Phalanx, lasted from July 2010 to Sept. 2011. Intended to help reduce drug and human trafficking, the effort cost an estimated $110 million. At the time, critics argued the deployment was not worth the cost."

“It’s shocking just how small of the iceberg the general population understands” about undocumented immigrants, he said.
Castillo’s first poetry collection, “Cenzontle” is both spare and lyrical, communicating the reality and emotions of the immigrant experience in the U.S., and it comes at a time of hardline immigration rhetoric and policy from the White House.
Texas and Arizona are planning to send hundreds of National Guard personnel to the southern border with Mexico, spurred by President Trump’s urging and vocal disapproval of more than 200 Central-American migrants who are traveling through Mexico to seek asylum from gang violence in Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador.
The president champions a tough stance on migrant apprehensions and deportations. “We’re throwing out by the hundreds,” he recently told a West Virginia roundtable on tax reform.
Meanwhile in U.S. immigration courts, the Justice Department will begin linking job performance with how quickly judges close immigration cases — efforts meant to speed up the deportation process and reduce case backlog, but which leave some worrying that the quotas will compromise individuals’ rights to a fair trial.

Castillo said the inspiration for his work came at a crossroads in his life: his transition from being undocumented to a protected student under Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA.
In the collection, Castillo’s imagery and dream-like phrases allow him to speak of his immigration status in a way he hadn’t been able to before.
“I couldn’t bring myself to talk about being undocumented, what it’s like… being a second grader and… worrying about state tests, if they ask for a social [security number],” Castillo said. “So what else did I have?”
While Trump tweeted earlier this month that “DACA is dead,” statistics from the Justice Department show that more than 50,000 initial and renewal applications for DACA were approved this year. Despite the approvals, the Arizona Supreme Court ruled this week that students with DACA status are no longer eligible for in-state tuition at state colleges.
Given the current politics, Castillo — like many others with a similar immigration status — was cautious about what he could say about himself in writing. He says his poetry “enacts the survival strategies that I grew up with and I’m still trying to negotiate.”
Castillo sees Trump’s push to send the National Guard to the border as part of a campaign to paint immigrants as national enemies. His prose poem “Field Notes Ending in a Deportation,” was written in direct response to these migration policies.
“I turn to somebody who I love, who’s sitting right next to me,” he said, “And I’m like, ‘This is about you right here.’ There there is no gray area.”

Field Notes Ending in a Deportation
By Marcelo Hernandez Castillo
I confess to you my inadequacies. I want to tell you things I do not know about myself. I’ve made promises to people whom I will never see again. I’ve cried in an airport bathroom stall in El Paso, TX when immigration denied my father’s application. It felt like a mathematical equation—everything on one side needed to equal everything on the other. It almost made sense to be that sad. I am not compelled to complicate this metaphor. I’m selling this for two dollars. Years ago, on my birthday, I came out to my friends. I thought about the possibility of painting their portraits. What a stupid idea. I’ve started to cover up certain words with Barbie stickers in my journal. It occurs to me, sitting in my car, at a Dollar General parking lot, in search of cheap balloons for a party which I do not care about, that I am allowed my own joy. I pick the brightest balloons, pay, drive home and dress for the party. I mouth the words happy birthday to you in a dark room lit by everyone’s phone cameras. Afterwards, I enter all of my emails from five years into a cloud engine and the most used word is ok. I confess that I have had a good life. I spend many nights obsessing over the placement of my furniture. I give you my boredom. I give you my obligation. I give you the night I danced and danced and danced at a child’s birthday party, drunk and by myself. I’ve been someone else’s shame. It’s true, at its core, amá was deported because she was hit by a car. For years to come, this will be the ending of a sad joke she likes to tell. I laugh each time she tells the joke to strangers. Something about how there is more metal than bone in her arm. Something about a magnet. She says I thought I had died and death meant repeating a name forever. She says el jardin encierra la boca de mis pasos. But this is a bad translation. It’s more like I felt like a star, I felt like somebody famous.

We take a moment every week to bring you important stories beyond the White House and the Capitol. Here’s what we’re reading now.

Myanmar is not ready for the repatriation of Rohingya refugees, a senior United Nations official said after a six-day visit to the country.
“From what I’ve seen and heard from people – no access to health services, concerns about protection, continued displacements – conditions are not conducive to return,” U.N. Assistant Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs Ursula Mueller told Reuters.
Mueller, the highest ranking U.N. official to visit Myanmar this year, went into Rakhine state, where reports first originated last year that the Myanmar military had burned villages and killed civilians. Mueller also met with Myanmar military and defense officials, as well as de-facto civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi.
In November 2017, Myanmar and Bangladesh signed a deal to allow Rohingya Muslims to return. But the villages where Rohingyas lived have been bulldozed, and Mueller said she didn’t see preparations for Rohingyas to return to that land. Myanmar officials said they razed the villages to build resettlement camps, according to Reuters. [Reuters]
Why it matters: Myanmar and Bangladesh agreed on a two-year window for repatriation in January. Nearly 700,000 Rohingya currently reside in makeshift camps in Bangladesh, which shares a border with Myanmar. In August 2017, reports emerged that the Myanmar military burned Rohingya villages in Rakhine state and killed thousands in response to militant attacks on security forces. The U.N. has called the assault from Burmese security forces ethnic cleansing. Burmese Buddhist writers and human rights advocates have even written an open letter to Buddhist figures in majority-Buddhist Myanmar, urging them to intercede on behalf of the Muslim Rohingya. The return to Myanmar, originally scheduled for January, was postponed because of security concerns for the refugees, and repatriation has not yet begun. It’s not clear what impact Mueller’s report will have on that timeline.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has discovered more than 200 rare antibiotic-resistant genes in bacteria from hospitals and medical centers in the United States.
In a study issued last week, the CDC reported the genes were found in 27 states.
As part of the testing, the CDC reviewed more than 5,000 isolated strains of bacteria. It found one in four of the strains had a gene that would spread antibiotic resistance and 221 “especially rare resistance genes.”
Health officials have monitored changes and mutations in antibiotic-resistant bacteria since first learning about it in 1988, and the presence of varying strains of these germs in medical facilities around the world has grown since then.
This was the first year the CDC tested for rare genes, so the agency does not have trend data.[CNN]
Why it matters: Each year, 2 million Americans get antibiotic-resistant infections and about 23,000 die as a result. Global overuse of antibiotics has become an issue for health care professionals fighting these resistant bacteria. Antibiotic use has more than doubled worldwide since 2000, and immoderate antibiotic prescription and consumption has led to increasingly dangerous resistant infections.
As PBS NewsHour’s Laura Santhanam reported: Simply put, the more antibiotics you use, the more your body normalizes them, and the faster resistance to them will emerge. When the drugs stop working, people can die of once-treatable infections, like pneumonia or gonorrhea. Read her report on what you should know about the overuse of antibiotics here.

There’s confusion surrounding an officer-involved shooting case in Savannah, Georgia.
Earlier this year, after several officers shot and killed Ricky Jerome Boyd outside his grandmother’s home, authorities initially said the 20-year-old black man shot at officers first.
Police officers, along with U.S. Marshals, arrived at the home Jan. 23 to serve a warrant for Boyd, who was the suspect in a homicide investigation. When Boyd was ordered outside the house, he confronted officers with what officers believed to be a firearm. However, an investigation later revealed that Boyd was holding a “C02 powered BB air gun.”
For weeks, Boyd’s family has disputed the police’s version of events, saying the shooting was unjustified because Boyd was unarmed and hadn’t shot at officers. WTOC reported that the police department’s account of events changed, to say Boyd had “confronted” — not shot at — officers and had ignored verbal commands.
Boyd’s grandmother Mattie Wallace told WTOC that moments before officers opened fire, she heard someone say Boyd has a gun. “I say, ‘Don’t shoot. He don’t have no gun. Don’t shoot. Don’t have no gun,'” she told WTOC, adding that Boyd’s hands were raised before he was shot. She said the release of body camera footage would clear Boyd’s name.
Savannah police have not spoken publicly about the family’s request. The Associated Press reported that prosecutors are still reviewing the case, and in Georgia, body camera footage is typically not released during an open investigation. [WTOC]
Why it matters:The Boyd case predates some recent, prominent fatal police shootings that also involve unarmed victims, sparking widespread protests in their communities. In March, police fatally shot Stephon Clark in Sacramento, California, after officers believed the 22-year-old black man had a gun. A cell phone, not a gun, was recovered from the scene.
Last week, Saheed Vassell was shot and killed by New York police officers in the Crown Heights neighborhood of Brooklyn after officers confronted the 34-year-old black man in response to 911 calls about a man threatening people with a gun. Vassell, whose family said he struggled with bipolar disorder, was later shown in released surveillance video to holding up an object to various people in the community. But Vassell did not have a “silver gun” as described in the reports; it was a metal pipe.
Jelani Cobb of The New Yorker pointed to these cases and others,writing that while police shootings disproportionately affect people of color, they affect white Americans, too — and “as Stephon Clark’s death shows, we live in a time when the term ‘unarmed’ is becoming inconsequential — and, for a black man in certain settings, meaningless.” Cobb argues that is in part because of our collective inability to control gun access.
“The super-abundance of guns is presented as a central argument for needing more firearms. The alleged tools of self-protection, in turn, foster new dangers, which are then used to justify even more devotion to firearms,” he wrote.

Viktor Orbán won a third consecutive term as Hungary’s prime minister on Sunday.
Orbán, 54 and a member of the far-right Fidesz party, campaigned on an anti-migrant platform, an issue that has divided European Union members in recent years.
In local elections, the Fidesz party also earned 49 percent of the vote, earning a two-thirds majority in parliament. That “will give the party a free hand to pursue still deeper legal and constitutional changes that have already given it firm control over courts and other state institutions,” the New York Times writes.
The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe said while the country’s election was free, it was not necessarily fair, citing “intimidating and xenophobic rhetoric, media bias and opaque campaign financing.”
“While voters were presented with clear options in these elections, the shrinking of space for genuine debate hindered their ability to make a fully informed choice,” OSCE’s Douglas Wake said in a statement. “The government’s excessive spending on ads that amplified the ruling coalition’s campaign message undermined contestants’ ability to compete on an equal basis.” [The New York Times]
Why it matters: Orbán cruised to victory using the same kind of rhetoric as other popular anti-EU nationalist figures such as Marine Le Pen, the leader of France’s far-right Front National, and Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki, a close ally to Hungary who has refused to accept Eritrean and Syrian refugees awaiting relocation under Europe’s migrant plan, according to the BBC.
Since 2014, more than 1.7 million migrants have flocked to Europe. Overwhelmed by the influx of those seeking asylum or new homes, the EU passed a plan to spread 160,000 migrants across its member countries.
Hungary, Poland and Slovakia challenged that quota system, but the EU’s Court of Justice ruled last fall that the countries must participate, saying the program was “necessary to respond effectively and swiftly to an emergency situation characterized by a sudden inflow of displaced persons.”
Orbán has made a point in the months leading up to the election to call for closing off Hungary to migration quotas, the Times reported, and while in power, has “systematically curtailed the ability of people to seek asylum here.” He has also accused the European Commission, the governing body of the EU, of overreaching on areas like migration, CNN notes.
“Orbán’s new mandate makes it less likely that Brussels will be able to hold him to account over democratic backsliding,” the European Stability Initiative’s András told The Guardian, which noted that the leaders of other European countries may also feel there is “no alternative to Orbán, which would make it harder to apply pressure and give him more leeway to brush off criticism.”

Zoos across the country are looking for ways to give visitors up-close contact with animals like the naked mole rat or armadillo that aren’t as popular as lions or tigers or bears.
These “animal ambassadors” are zoo creatures trained to interact with humans — for a fee.
Walking a cheetah on a leash at the Houston Zoo, for example, costs $195, the Wall Street Journal reported. Personal sessions with other, smaller zoo residents command smaller fees, depending on the animal and its popularity.
For conservationists and zoo employees, the mission is to get people into the same room with less sought-after species and spark a new interest.
“It’s amazing how excited people get,” Erin Gray, head of animal ambassadors at the Nashville Zoo, said about people meeting skunks. “It’s all about changing perceptions,” she told the Wall Street Journal. [Wall Street Journal]
Why it matters: According to researchers, zoo patrons who personally interact with an animal are more likely to support conservation efforts in the animal’s habitat and to express greater concern for the animal after meeting it.

https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/national-guards-last-border-deployments-offer-clues-to-the-future,migrant,771,2018-04-06T12:33:20-04:00,"Elliot Spagat, Associated Press",National Guard’s last border deployments offer clues to the future,"SAN DIEGO — The U.S. National Guard faces a vastly different environment than it did on its last two deployments to the border with Mexico, with far fewer illegal crossings and more Central Americans than Mexicans coming.
Still, its role is shaping up much the same: moving more Border Patrol agents from behind-the-scenes jobs to the front lines.
President Donald Trump told reporters Thursday that he wants to send between 2,000 and 4,000 National Guard members to the U.S.-Mexico border to help federal officials fight illegal immigration and drug trafficking. That estimate is lower than the 6,400 Guard members that former President George Bush sent to the border.
From 2006 to 2008, the Guard fixed vehicles, maintained roads, repaired fences and performed ground surveillance. Its second mission in 2010 and 2011 involved more aerial surveillance and intelligence work. People involved in both operations say the Guard was the Border Patrol’s “eyes and ears.”
Federal law, notably the Posse Comitatus Act of 1878, limits military involvement in civilian law enforcement, creating a supporting role for the Guard. The Trump administration and governors haven’t said precisely what an estimated 2,000 to 4,000 troops will do, but Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen anticipates vehicle maintenance and aerial surveillance will be in the mix.
WATCH: Trump’s tweets about DACA and migrant ‘caravans’ in context
Operation Jump Start, from May 2006 to July 2008, sent 6,000 troops to the border in its first year and 3,000 the second year and was framed as a way to buy time amid an unprecedented Border Patrol hiring spree and heavy political pressure for immediate action. The Border Patrol ballooned by thousands of agents during the operation to about 20,000, roughly where it is today.
About 40 percent of troops went to Arizona, the busiest corridor for illegal crossings at the time, followed in order by Texas, California and New Mexico. The Border Patrol made about 1.1 million arrests the year Jump Start began, nearly four times what it did last year.
The Guard was assigned to observation posts some distance from the border for safety reasons, using binoculars and other gear to spot people crossing. Richard Barlow, then a top Border Patrol official in San Diego, said their success as lookouts varied because they were unarmed and needed protection in more dangerous areas.
“They aren’t allowed to have contact (with people arrested), so they’re basically eyes,” Barlow said.
Arrests had fallen by about half and hundreds of miles of border barriers were added by May 2010, when Operation Phalanx sent 1,200 troops to the border amid backlash to the killing of an Arizona rancher. Crossers were still largely Mexican men entering the country through Arizona deserts.
The Guard flew planes at high altitudes to identify people crossing, said Barlow, then the Border Patrol’s top agent in Tucson, Arizona. It also responded by helicopter to agents who asked for help when closing in on a group.
A bigger focus on intelligence work involved mining for trends and collaborating with investigators from other agencies, Barlow said.
Since then, crossings have shifted to Central American women and children crossing in Texas’ Rio Grande Valley, many who turn themselves in to authorities and seek asylum or other protection. Mexicans accounted for only about 4 of every 10 arrests last year, down from about 9 of 10 during the Guard’s previous deployments.
A shared border means Mexicans can often be quickly turned around, but the Border Patrol holds Central Americans until another agency takes custody, typically within three days.
“The numbers are the numbers, but the type of numbers is what’s critically important today,” said David Aguilar, Border Patrol chief during the Guard’s first deployment and deputy commissioner of parent agency Customs and Border Protection during the second.
Then-Border Patrol Chief Mark Morgan testified in 2016 that he never imagined his job would entail procuring baby powder and baby wipes. Agents’ tasks include making sure burritos are served at the right temperature.
“It takes a tremendous amount of resources to do this,” Morgan said.
Aguilar, who retired in 2013, said he expected the Guard to take on surveillance work again — this time by air, ground and water. It’s unclear if federal law allows troops to run detention facilities, but Aguilar doesn’t see that happening.
“Is (the Department of Defense) and National Guard equipped to do that, trained to do that?” he said. “Just like the Border Patrol, the answer is no, nor should they be encumbered with those responsibilities. That’s not what our military does.”

https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/trump-bashes-immigration-policies-at-tax-cut-event,migrant,688,2018-04-05T16:30:48-04:00,"Catherine Lucey, Associated Press",Trump bashes immigration policies at tax cut event,"WHITE SULPUR SPRINGS, West Virginia — Tossing his “boring” prepared remarks into the air, President Donald Trump on Thursday unleashed a fierce denunciation of the nation’s immigration policies, calling for tougher border security while repeating his unsubstantiated claim that “millions” of people voted illegally in California.
Trump was in West Virginia to showcase the benefits of Republican tax cuts, but he took a big and meandering detour to talk about his tough immigration and trade plans. He linked immigration with the rise of violent gangs like MS-13 and suggested anew that there had been widespread fraud in the 2016 election that cost him the popular vote.
“In many places, like California, the same person votes many times. You probably heard about that,” Trump said. “They always like to say, ‘Oh, that’s a conspiracy theory.’ Not a conspiracy theory, folks. Millions and millions of people. And it’s very hard because the state guards their records. They don’t want us” to see them.
While there have been isolated cases of voter fraud in the U.S., past studies have found it to be exceptionally rare. Earlier this year the White House disbanded a controversial voter fraud commission amid infighting and lawsuits as state officials refused to cooperate.
In recent weeks, Trump has been pushing back more against the restraints of the office to offer more unvarnished opinions and take policy moves that some aides were trying to forestall.
“This was going to be my remarks. They would have taken about two minutes,” Trump said as he tossed his script into the air. “This is boring. We have to tell it like it is.”
As he has done before, Trump conjured images of violence and suffering when he described the perils of illegal immigration, though statistics show that immigrants commit crimes at a lower rate than citizens. He dubbed MS-13 gang members “thugs” and said his administration’s crackdown on the group was “like a war.”
MORE: Trump’s tweets about DACA and migrant ‘caravans’ in context
“MS-13 is emblematic of evil, and we’re getting them out by the hundreds,” said Trump, who sat on stage at a long table in a gym draped in American flags and decorated with signs that read “USA open for business.” ”This is the kind of stuff and crap we are allowing in our country, and we can’t do it anymore.”
Invoking the lines of his June 2015 campaign kickoff speech, in which he suggested that some Mexican immigrants were rapists, the president appeared to claim that a caravan of migrants that had been working its way north through Mexico toward the United States was besieged with violence.
“Remember my opening remarks at Trump Tower when I opened? Everybody said, ‘Oh, he was so tough,’ and I used the word rape,” he said. “And yesterday it came out where this journey coming up, women are raped at levels that nobody has ever seen before. They don’t want to mention that.”
It was not clear what Trump was referring to. White House spokesman Hogan Gidley said Trump wasn’t talking about the caravan but rather about extreme victimization of those making the journey north with smugglers in general.
Trump also defended his proposed tariff plan, which many of his fellow Republicans fear will start a trade war with China. He criticized West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin, a Democrat who has expressed openness to working with the White House, for opposing the GOP tax plan. He praised local West Virginia politicians running for office and reminisced about his 2016 electoral victory in the Mountain State.
All of that overshadowed any time spent promoting the tax plan.
While Trump went off script, the attendees —an assemblage of state politicians, local business owners, workers and families — stayed dutifully on task, talking about how the tax cuts have helped them.
Jessica Hodge tearfully told Trump: “I just want to say thank you for the tax cuts. This is a big deal for our family.” Rep. Evan Jenkins, a Republican, said that “West Virginians understand your policies are working” and that Trump was “welcome to come back any time.”

Trump did not offer further details and the White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Trump told reporters on Tuesday that he’s been discussing the idea of using the military at the border with Defense Secretary Jim Mattis.
“We’re going to be doing things militarily. Until we can have a wall and proper security, we’re going to be guarding our border with the military,” Trump said, calling the move a “big step.”
It wasn’t immediately clear exactly how the proposal would work or what kind of troops Trump wanted to deploy, but the White House later said Trump wanted to mobilize the National Guard.
Federal law prohibits the use of active-duty service members for law enforcement inside the U.S., unless specifically authorized by Congress. But over the past 12 years, presidents have twice sent National Guard troops to the border to bolster security and assist with surveillance and other support. The White House counsel’s office has been working on the idea for several weeks, according to a senior official who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal plans.
Trump has been frustrated by slow action on building a wall along the Mexican border. He’s previously suggested using the Pentagon’s budget to pay for the wall, arguing it is a national security priority, despite strict rules that prohibit spending that’s not authorized by Congress.
President Donald Trump met with the leaders of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania at the White House earlier this week. During those talks, Trump said he wants to deploy the military to secure the U.S.-Mexico border as the administration continues to push for the president’s calls for a border wall.
At the Pentagon, officials struggled throughout the day Tuesday to answer questions about the plan, including rudimentary details on whether it would involve National Guard members.
But the administration appeared to be considering a model similar to a 2006 operation in which President George W. Bush deployed National Guard troops to the southern border.
Under Operation Jump Start, 6,000 National Guard troops were sent to assist the border patrol with non-law enforcement duties while additional border agents were hired and trained. Over two years, about 29,000 National Guard forces participated as forces rotated in and out. The Guard members were used for surveillance, communications, administrative support, intelligence, analysis and the installation of border security infrastructure.
In addition, President Barack Obama sent about 1,200 National Guard troops to the U.S.-Mexico border in 2010 to beef up efforts against drug smuggling and illegal immigration.
Texas also deployed military forces to its 800-mile (1,290-kilometer) border with Mexico. Former Texas Gov. Rick Perry, now Trump’s energy secretary, sent 1,000 Texas National Guardsmen to the Rio Grande Valley in 2014 in response to a sharp increase in Central American children crossing the border alone.
Trump met Tuesday with top administration officials, including Mattis, Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen and Attorney General Jeff Sessions, to discuss the administration’s strategy to address what White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders described as “the growing influx of illegal immigration, drugs and violent gang members from Central America.”
In addition to mobilizing the National Guard, Trump and senior officials “agreed on the need to pressure Congress to urgently pass legislation to close legal loopholes exploited by criminal trafficking, narco-terrorist and smuggling organizations,” Sanders said.
Trump has been fixated on the issue since he grudgingly signed a spending bill last month that includes far less money for the wall than he’d hoped for.
The $1.3 trillion package included $1.6 billion for border wall spending — a fraction of the $25 billion Trump made a last-minute push to secure. And much of that money can be used only to repair existing segments, not to build new sections.
Trump spent the first months of his presidency bragging about a dramatic drop in illegal border crossings. Indeed, the 2017 fiscal year marked a 45-year low for Border Patrol arrests. But the numbers have been slowly ticking up since last April and are now on par with many months of the Obama administration. Statistics show 36,695 arrests of people trying to cross the southwest border in February 2018, up from 23,555 in the same month of the previous year.
At last week’s meeting, Trump “directed a vigorous administrative strategy to confront this threat and protect America’s national security,” said Sanders. Tuesday’s briefing was a follow-up to discuss the plans.
Trump appeared to claim credit Tuesday for halting a caravan of about 1,100 migrants, many from Honduras, who had been marching along roadsides and train tracks in the southern Mexican state of Oaxaca.
“I said (to Mexican officials), ‘I hope you’re going to tell that caravan not to get up to the border.’ And I think they’re doing that because, as of 12 minutes ago, it was all being broken up,” he said.
But the caravan of largely Central American migrants had never intended to reach the U.S. border, according to organizer Irineo Mujica. It was meant to end at a migrants’ rights symposium in central Mexico later this week.
The caravan stopped to camp at a sports field in Oaxaca over the weekend. Mexican immigration officers have been signing them up for temporary transit visas, which would allow them to travel to the U.S. border, possibly to seek asylum, or to seek asylum status in Mexico.

Speaking at a lunch with Baltic leaders, Trump said he’s been discussing the idea with his Defense Secretary, Jim Mattis.
“We’re going to be doing things militarily. Until we can have a wall and proper security, we’re going to be guarding our border with the military,” he said, calling the measure a “big step.”
“We really haven’t done that before, or certainly not very much before,” he said.
Trump has been deeply frustrated about the lack of progress building what was the signature promise of his campaign: a “big, beautiful wall” along the Mexican border. He’s previously suggested using the Pentagon’s budget to pay for building the wall, arguing it is a national security priority, despite strict rules that prohibit spending that’s not authorized by Congress.
The Department of Homeland Security, Pentagon and White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment on how such a plan might work.
Sending military to the border, in the form of National Guard troops, has been done before. In 2006, under Operation Jump Start, 6,000 troops were sent to the border in an effort to increase security and surveillance. The operation used the National Guard to assist border patrol with non-law enforcement duties while additional border agents were hired and trained.
The number declined during the second year to about 3,000.
Over the two years, about 29,000 National Guard forces participated in the missions, as forces rotated in and out.
The Guard members were used for surveillance, communications, administrative support, intelligence, analysis and, in some cases, the installation of border security infrastructure. Over the two years, more than 30 miles of fencing and 13 miles of road were built, and more than 86 miles of vehicle barriers were installed.
Active duty U.S. troops were not used for the operation because there are prohibitions on using so-called Title 10 troops for law enforcement and similar duties within the United States.
In addition, President Barack Obama sent about 1,200 National Guard troops to the U.S.-Mexico border in 2010 to beef up efforts to battle drug smuggling and illegal immigration. Again, the troops did intelligence, surveillance, analysis and other support as more border patrol and customs agents were hired.
At that time, officials also emphasized that the Guard forces would not be working on the front lines or interacting with people crossing the border.
READ MORE: Trump calls for border legislation using ‘nuclear option’
Trump’s announcement came a day administration officials said they’re crafting a new legislative package aimed at closing immigration “loopholes.”
Trump also called on Republican lawmakers to immediately pass a border bill using the “Nuclear Option if necessary” to muscle it through, as part of a flurry of tweets on the subject over the last several days.
The president has also been declaring protections for so-called Dreamer immigrants “dead,” accusing Democrats of allowing “open borders, drugs and crime” and warning Mexico to halt the passage of “caravans” of immigrants or risk U.S. abandonment of the North American Free Trade Agreement.
Trump has been seething since realizing the major spending bill he signed last month barely funds the wall he has promised supporters. The $1.3 trillion funding package included $1.6 billion in border wall spending — far less than the $25 billion Trump made a last-minute push to secure. And much of that money can be used only to repair existing segments, not to build new sections.
Among the new measures the administration is pursuing: ending special safeguards that prevent the immediate deportation of children arrested at the border and traveling alone. Under current law, unaccompanied children from countries that don’t border the U.S. are turned over to the Department of Health and Human Services and undergo often lengthy deportation proceedings before an immigration judge instead of being immediately deported.
The administration is also pushing Congress to terminate a 1997 court settlement that requires the government to release children from custody to parents, adult relatives or other caretakers as their court cases proceed. Officials complain that many children never show up at their hearings.
The proposals appear the same as those included on an immigration wish list the White House released in October but failed to gain traction during negotiations over the border wall. Such proposals are likely to face opposition from moderate Republicans and Democrats going into the midterm elections. But Trump appears intent on ensuring the issues remain at the forefront of public conversation, even though the spending bill was widely seen as the last major legislation likely passed this year.
Trump’s past calls to for the “nuclear option” — changing Senate rules so that a simple majority of 51 votes is needed to advance legislation, instead of the current 60 votes — have been dismissed by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. McConnell says Republicans will welcome the 60-vote margin if they return to the minority. The current 51-49 Senate split favors Republicans.
Trump announced last year that he was ending DACA, the program that protects young “Dreamer” immigrants and allows them to work legally in the country, but the Department of Homeland Security is continuing to issue renewals because of a court order.
Notably, Trump’s favored solution for extending the protections mustered only 39 votes in the Senate, meaning it couldn’t have passed even if the rules had been changed.
Trump also warned Mexico to halt the passage of about 1,100 migrants, many from Honduras, who had been marching in a caravan along roadsides and train tracks in the southern Mexican state of Oaxaca.
“If it reaches our border, our laws are so weak and so pathetic,” Trump claimed. “It’s like we have no border.”
These “Stations of the Cross” migrant caravans have been held in southern Mexico for at least the last five years. They began as short processions of migrants, some dressed in biblical garb and carrying crosses, as an Easter-season protest against attacks against Central Americans as they cross Mexico.
The caravan that once numbered 1,150 or more people actually halted days ago in the town of Matias Romero in the southern state of Oaxaca, where participants slept out in the open. After days of walking along roadsides and train tracks, the organizers now plan to try to get buses to take participants to the final event, an immigrants’ rights conference in the central state of Puebla later this week.

Cash cow NAFTA is in play, as is foreign aid to Honduras and the countries that allow this to happen. Congress MUST ACT NOW!” Trump tweeted at daybreak Tuesday.

Trump spent much of the weekend at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, having meals with his family, watching cable news shows and rubbing elbows with conservative commentators including Fox News host Sean Hannity, according to several club members. Also spotted at the club: champion golfer Dustin Johnson, MyPillow maker Michael J. Lindell, boxing promoter Don King and former New York Police Commissioner Bernie Kerik.

Individuals in the caravans often try to reach the U.S. border but usually not as part of the caravan. The caravans typically don’t proceed much farther north than the Gulf Coast state of Veracruz. The current march is scheduled to end this month with a conference on migration issues in the central Mexican state of Puebla.

We take a moment every week to bring you important stories beyond the White House and the Capitol. Here’s what we’re reading now.

Alabama will become the third state in the country to allow the use of nitrogen gas to execute prisoners — a method that has never been used before.
The Associated Press reported that Gov. Kay Ivey signed a bill last month that would allow the use of nitrogen hypoxia if lethal injection drugs aren’t available or are ruled unconstitutional.
Nitrogen hypoxia would force inmates to only breathe nitrogen, an inert gas, which causes oxygen depletion in the blood stream, the AP said.
When the new law takes effect June 1, Alabama will join Oklahoma and Mississippi as the only states in the country that allow the use of the method. Last week, Oklahoma announced it would start using nitrogen hypoxia as its primary method to execute death row inmates going forward. Mississippi, on the other hand, currently allows its use as an alternative, according to the Montgomery Advertiser. [The Associated Press]
Why it matters
Alabama’s decision to authorize nitrogen hypoxia has raised questions about the ethics behind using untested execution methods.
State Rep. Jim Hill and other supporters have argued that the method is humane and could lead to peaceful deaths, the Advertiser reported. Opponents say it is risky since it has never been tested.
Similarly, when Nevada and Nebraska pushed for the country’s first fentanyl-assisted executions last year, doctors and death penalty opponents argued that they could result in painful botched executions since such methods had never been tested, according to the Washington Post.
Nebraska has already made plans to execute an inmate using a mix of drugs including fentanyl, but it has not yet set a date. Meanwhile, Nevada’s state Supreme Court will hear oral arguments in May about whether to allow the use of fentanyl and other drugs for executions.
A caravan made up of hundreds of Central American migrants is moving northward through Mexico, hoping to reach the U.S. border to ask for asylum.
I’m traveling with a caravan of about 1,200 mostly Central American migrants traveling through Mexico. The group is being organized by Pueblos Sin Fronteras. It’s shaping up to be the largest one they’ve ever had. Here’s a clip from yesterday. pic.twitter.com/9hQt6fb3Wv
— Adolfo Flores (@aflores) March 27, 2018
The group, the majority of them from Honduras, was organized by the volunteer group Pueblos sin Fronteras. The organization told Adolfo Flores of Buzzfeed News, who has been following the procession, that they hope the size of the group is enough to dissuade interference from Mexican authorities, cartel groups and smugglers, all of whom have been flagged by immigrant advocacy groups for their abuses against undocumented migrants.
As has been the case with the waves of Central American migrants fleeing their countries in recent years, they’re often leaving their home countries due to violence, poverty and political unrest.
This latest group started from Tapachula, Mexico, close to the border of Guatemala. As CNN pointed out, this is the fifth caravan spear-headed by the advocacy group, though organizers say it’s the biggest one yet.
Organizers told Buzzfeed News that they expect about two-thirds of the group to ask for asylum when they reach the border, though the migrants have been told that there’s no guarantee that the U.S. will grant that protection. [Buzzfeed News]
Why it matters
It remains to be seen how U.S. authorities will respond to the caravan once it reaches the U.S. border. But President Donald Trump aired his frustrations about the group on Twitter this past weekend, including posting misinformation about the nation’s immigration policies.
On Sunday, Trump tweeted that ‘“caravans’ coming” and that Republicans ought to exercise a “Nuclear Option to pass tough laws NOW. NO MORE DACA DEAL!” Later he suggested the people in the caravan were “trying to take advantage of DACA.” On Monday, he continued to lash out against the caravan and Mexico on Twitter.
Border Patrol Agents are not allowed to properly do their job at the Border because of ridiculous liberal (Democrat) laws like Catch & Release. Getting more dangerous. “Caravans” coming. Republicans must go to Nuclear Option to pass tough laws NOW. NO MORE DACA DEAL!
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 1, 2018
Though Trump connected the caravan to a deal on the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, many of the Central American migrants probably wouldn’t qualify for the granted protection under the program, which protects young immigrants brought to the U.S illegally as children. Dozens in the caravan said so as much, when they spoke with Flores.
For whatever reason Trump is conflating two different issues, DACA and reasons these people are on the caravan. I’ve spoken with dozens of people who cite violence, instability, and poverty as reasons for leaving. Not one has mentioned DACA.
— Adolfo Flores (@aflores) April 1, 2018
On Monday, Department of Homeland Security head Kirstjen Nielsen tweeted,”Working with Mexican officials to address the yearly illegal alien caravan. Exploring all options.”

Thousands of Oklahoma teachers protested at the state Capitol on Monday, the start of what was expected to be several days of walkouts over teacher pay and a lack of education funding.
As the PBS NewsHour’s Victoria Pasquantonio has reported, the teachers have rejected a bill from the state legislature that would raise the average teacher’s pay by about $6,000, and add $50 million to education funding overall.
The teachers, whose salary ranks 49th nationwide, said that wasn’t enough. They haven’t received a pay raise in 10 years, according to Randi Weingarten, the president of the American Federation of Teachers.
While the bill passed last week represents the largest pay raise in the state’s history, 20 percent of school districts in Oklahoma have a four-day school week because of limited funding, Weingarten told NPR. Districts have textbooks that are decades old, and class sizes can reach 50 or 60 students, Weingarten said. Public school fundings need an additional $200 million to get to a five-day school week, she added. Teachers have already planned a second day of walkouts in Oklahoma City and Tulsa, two of the biggest cities in the state, the NewsHour reported. [The PBS NewsHour]
Why it matters
Teachers in Oklahoma began organizing around demands for better pay following a successful teachers’ strike in February in West Virginia. Teachers there went on strike for nine days before they reached a deal with state legislators to raise their pay by 5 percent and stall a hike in health care costs.
The demonstration has also inspired action in Kentucky, where schools in 21 counties closed Monday to protest school conditions, and in Arizona, where teachers have rallied at the state Capitol demanding a 20 percent pay increase.
Weingarten said she expected these kinds of strikes to continue.
“I think teachers are seeing that despair cannot be a strategy. They are seeing that the era of this passive resignation is over … you’re going to see more and more and more of this, because the states that have collective bargaining, they work this out at the bargaining table. But the states that don’t — like Oklahoma or West Virginia — they’re going to get more and more political.”

Malaysia’s lower house of Parliament has passed a bill that would make it illegal to publish or circulate “fake news.”
The New York Times reports that the bill, which is expected to pass the country’s Senate this week, would punish people who create and share misleading information with up to six years in prison. It would also apply to people who spread false reports inside and outside the country if Malaysian citizens are affected.
If approved, the measure would be the first of its kind in the world.
“Fake news has become a global phenomenon, but Malaysia is at the tip of the spear in trying to fight it with an anti-fake news law,” Fadhlullah Suhaimi Abdul Malek, a senior official with the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission, was quoted as saying in the New York Times. Opponents of the bill argue the measure is intended to limit free speech ahead of a general election in Malaysia, particularly discussion about financial scandal involving Prime Minister Najib Razak, who faces a tough contest in the general election this year. [The New York Times]
Why it matters
The decision in Malaysia comes as other countries in Southeast Asia, such as Singapore and the Philippines, are also weighing how to address the spread of “fake news,” Reuters reports. It also comes as the U.S. is weighing its own election security ahead of the 2018 midterms.
Law Minister Azalina Othman Said argued that the Malaysia law aims to protect the public from misinformation while allowing freedom of speech.
But critics, including opposition lawmaker Lim Guan Eng, say the measure would lead the country closer to dictatorship.

A Los Angeles judge has ruled that brewed coffee in California must carry a cancer warning.
The ruling was the result of 2010 lawsuit against Starbucks and about 90 other coffee sellers in The Golden State. The case, filed by the Council for Education and Research on Toxics, hinges on a California law from 1986 that requires warnings in situations where chemicals known to cause cancer or birth defects are present.
Coffee sellers in California must now either add the warnings or prove that their product won’t cause at least one extra case of cancer for every 100,000 people who consume the hot beverage, which would require decades of study. If they cannot, then the coffee makers face civil penalties amount to $2,500 per Californian exposed each day, dating back eight years to when the lawsuit was filed.
“Coffee has been shown, over and over again, to be a healthy beverage,” William Murray, president and CEO of the National Coffee Association, told the Associated Press in reaction to the decision.
Why it matters:
The cancer-linked chemical in question, acrylamide, doesn’t only form in roasted coffee, but many foods cooked above 250 degrees Fahrenheit, along with cookies, potato chips, breakfast cereals, prune juice and almost anything slapped onto a barbecue. Burning cigarettes make acrylamide too.
It’s formed when food is cooked at high temperatures, causing some carbohydrates to chemically react with asparagine, a naturally-occuring amino acid. When acrylamide enters our cells, it can create chemical byproducts that mutate DNA and could ostensibly lead to cancer.
This isn’t the first time businesses in California have had to add warnings about acrylamide to their products. The Metzger Law Group, who is behind the coffee lawsuit, also sued McDonald’s and Burger King in 2002 over the amount of acrylamide in their fried products. The legal action expanded to include potato-chip makers, like Frito-Lay and Kettle Foods, and french fry producers like Heinz in 2005. Fried potatoes possess some of the highest levels of acrylamide found in food products.
That case ended in a settlement in 2008, wherein the fast-food chains agreed to add cancer warnings about french fries and pay small civil penalties. The chip and french fry makers agreed to reduce acrylamide in their foods and pay close to $4 million in penalties and costs.
Despite these rulings, it’s still unclear whether enough acrylamide exists in food to cause cancer — which is why these judgments are so controversial. After reviewing more than 1,000 studies, the WHO decided in 2016 that there is no association between coffee and breast, pancreatic, prostate, uterine and liver cancer, reversing 25 years of earlier warnings about acrylamide. The American Cancer Society also states that “it’s not yet clear if acrylamide affects cancer risk in people.”
If you look at this list of individual food products and their acrylamide levels, you’ll find coffee doesn’t rank among the highest. Some Californians want Gov. Jerry Brown and state legislators to issue an exemption for their morning cup of joe."
https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/hope-and-dignity-pope-calls-for-peace-in-easter-message,migrant,528,2018-04-01T10:40:39-04:00,Associated Press,‘Hope and dignity:’ Pope calls for peace in Easter message,"VATICAN CITY — On Christianity’s most joyful day, Pope Francis called for peace in a world marked by war and conflict, “beginning with the beloved and long-suffering land of Syria” and extending to Israel, where 15 Palestinians were killed on the Israeli-Gaza border two days before Easter Sunday.
Francis reflected on the power of Christianity’s core belief — that Jesus rose from the dead following crucifixion — in his formal “Urbi et Orbi” Easter message delivered from the balcony of St. Peter’s Basilica to a packed square of some 80,000 faithful below.
The pontiff said the message of the resurrection offers hope in a world “marked by so many acts of injustice and violence,” including parts of Africa affected by “hunger, endemic conflicts and terrorism.”
“It bears fruits of hope and dignity where there are deprivation and exclusion, hunger and unemployment; where there are migrants and refugees, so often rejected by today’s culture of waste, and victims of the drug trade, human trafficking and contemporary forms of slavery,” the pope said.
Francis called for a “swift end” to the seven years of carnage in Syria, demanding that aid be delivered to the war-torn country’s needy and calling for “fitting conditions for the returned and the displaced.”
The pope also urged reconciliation in Israel, a place “experiencing in these days the wounds of ongoing conflict that do not spare the defenseless.” His remarks followed the Friday deaths of Palestinian protesters who charged toward Gaza’s border with Israel, the area’s deadliest violence in four years.
Turning to Asia, Francis expressed hope that talks underway could bring peace to the Korean peninsula, urging “those who are directly responsible act with wisdom and discernment to promote the good of the Korean people.”
The pope also urged more steps to bring harmony to divided Ukraine, called for peace in South Sudan and the Democratic Republic of Congo and appealed for the world not to forget victims of conflict, especially children.
“May there be no lack of solidarity with all those forced to leave their native lands and lacking the bare essentials for living,” said Francis, who has often championed the cause of migrants and refugees.
The church’s first pontiff from Latin America cited in particular the problems in Venezuela. He said he hoped the country would “find a just, peaceful and humane way to surmount quickly the political and humanitarian crises that grip it.”
Earlier, tens of thousands of faithful underwent heavy security checks to enter St. Peter’s Square to participate in Easter Sunday Mass celebrated by the pope, followed by his “Urbi et Orbi” message (“to the city and the world.”)
Security precautions included bag checks and metal detector wands for everyone entering the square, while the main avenue leading to the Vatican, as well as smaller adjoining streets, were closed to traffic.
Francis opened Easter festivities with a tweet to his global flock: “Our faith is born on Easter morning: Jesus is alive! The experience is at the heart of the Christian message.”
Elsewhere, hundreds of Christians marked Easter by flocking to Jerusalem’s Church of the Holy Sepulchre, built on the site where they believe Jesus was crucified, buried and resurrected."

Hundreds of Mexicans cross the border and line the sidewalks of Calexico’s tiny downtown by 4 a.m., napping on cardboard sheets and blankets or sipping coffee from a 24-hour doughnut shop until buses leave for the fields.
For decades, cross-border commuters have picked lettuce, carrots, broccoli, onions, cauliflower and other vegetables that make California’s Imperial Valley “America’s Salad Bowl” from December through March. As Trump visits the border Tuesday, the harvest is a reminder of how little has changed despite heated immigration rhetoric in Washington.
Trump will inspect eight prototypes for a future 30-foot border wall that were built in San Diego last fall. He made “a big, beautiful wall” a centerpiece of his campaign and said Mexico would pay for it.
But border barriers extend the same 654 miles (1,046 kilometers) they did under President Barack Obama and so far Trump hasn’t gotten Mexico or Congress to pay for a new wall.
Trump also pledged to expand the Border Patrol by 5,000 agents, but staffing fell during his first year in office farther below a congressional mandate because the government has been unable to keep pace with attrition and retirements. There were 19,437 agents at the end of September, down from 19,828 a year earlier.
WATCH: How increased security affects life for border residents
In Tijuana, tens of thousands of commuters still line up weekday mornings for San Diego at the nation’s busiest border crossing, some for jobs in landscaping, housekeeping, hotel maids and shipyard maintenance. The vast majority are U.S. citizens and legal residents or holders of “border crossing cards” that are given to millions of Mexicans in border areas for short visits. The border crossing cards do not include work authorization but some break the rules.
Even concern about Trump’s threat to end the North American Free Trade Agreement is tempered by awareness that border economies have been integrated for decades. Mexican “maquiladora” plants, which assemble duty-free raw materials for export to the U.S., have made televisions, medical supplies and other goods since the 1960s.
“How do you separate twins that are joined at the hip?” said Paola Avila, chairwoman of the Border Trade Alliance, a group that includes local governments and business chambers. “Our business relationships will continue to grow regardless of what happens with NAFTA.”

Workers in the Mexicali area rise about 1 a.m., carpool to the border crossing and wait about an hour to reach Calexico’s portico-covered sidewalks by 4 a.m. Some beat the border bottleneck by crossing at midnight to sleep in their cars in Calexico, a city of 40,000 about 120 miles (192 kilometers) east of San Diego.
Fewer workers make the trek now than 20 and 30 years ago. But not because of Trump.
Steve Scaroni, one of Imperial Valley’s largest labor contractors, blames the drop on lack of interest among younger Mexicans, which has forced him to rely increasingly on short-term farmworker visas known as H-2As.
“We have a saying that no one is raising their kids to be farmworkers,” said Scaroni, 55, a third-generation grower and one of Imperial Valley’s largest labor contractors. Last week, he had two or three buses of workers leaving Calexico before dawn, compared to 15 to 20 buses during the 1980s and 1990s.
Crop pickers at Scaroni’s Fresh Harvest Inc. make $13.18 an hour but H-2As bring his cost to $20 to $30 an hour because he must pay for round-trip transportation, sometimes to southern Mexico, and housing. The daily border commuters from Mexicali cost only $16 to $18 after overhead.
Scaroni’s main objective is to expand the H-2A visa program, which covered about 165,000 workers in 2016. On his annual visit to Washington in February to meet members of Congress and other officials, he decided within two hours that nothing changed under Trump.
“Washington is not going to fix anything,” he said. “You’ve got too many people – lobbyists, politicians, attorneys – who make money off the dysfunction. They make money off of not solving problems. They just keep talking about it.”
Jose Angel Valenzuela, who owns a house in Mexicali and is working his second harvest in Imperial Valley, earns more picking cabbage in an hour than he did in a day at a factory in Mexico. He doesn’t pay much attention to news and isn’t following developments on the border wall.
“We’re doing very well,” he said as workers passed around beef tacos during a break. “We haven’t seen any noticeable change.”
Jack Vessey, whose family farms about 10,000 acres in Imperial Valley, relies on border commuters for about half of his workforce. Imperial has only 175,000 people and Mexicali has about 1 million, making Mexico an obvious labor pool.
Vessey, 42, said he has seen no change on the border and doesn’t expect much. He figures 10 percent of Congress embraces open immigration policies, another 10 percent oppose them and the other 80 percent don’t want to touch it because their voters are too divided.
“It’s like banging your head against the wall,” he said.

The lawsuit follows action the ACLU took in the case of a Congolese woman and her 7-year-old daughter, who the group said was taken from her mother “screaming and crying” and placed in a Chicago facility. While the woman was released Tuesday from a San Diego detention center, the girl remains in the facility 2,000 miles (3,200 kilometers) away.
Immigrant advocates say the mother and daughter’s case is emblematic of the approach taken by President Donald Trump’s administration. The lawsuit, filed in federal district court in San Diego, asks a judge to declare family separation unlawful and says hundreds of families have been split by immigration authorities.
The lawsuit also raises the case of a Brazilian woman who the ACLU says was separated from her 14-year-old son after they sought asylum in August. The ACLU says the woman was given a roughly 25-day sentence jail sentence for illegally entering the country and then placed in immigration detention facilities in West Texas, while her son was taken to a Chicago facility.
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security has not announced a formal policy to hold adult asylum seekers separately from their children. But administration officials have said they are considering separating parents and children to deter others from trying to enter the U.S.
The department declined to comment Friday on the lawsuit. DHS acting press secretary Tyler Houlton, in an earlier statement on the case of the Congolese woman and her daughter, said government officials have to verify that children entering the U.S. are not victims of traffickers and that the adult accompanying them is actually their parent.
In separate court papers filed Wednesday, the U.S. government said it is awaiting the results of DNA testing to confirm the woman is the girl’s mother.

“We ask that members of the public and media view advocacy group claims that we are separating women and children for reasons other than to protect the child with the level of skepticism they deserve,” Houlton said.
It’s hard to determine how often parents and children are placed in separate facilities after they seek asylum, which is granted to people who have a credible fear of persecution if they are forced to return to their home country.
Different government agencies are responsible for holding adults and children. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detains adults accused of immigration violations, while the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services cares for unaccompanied immigrant children.
Immigration advocates criticized President Barack Obama’s administration for opening new family detention facilities in Texas and called for parents and children to be released. The two Texas facilities that it opened were found by a federal judge in 2015 to violate a long-standing 1997 settlement requiring children be released or otherwise held in the “least restrictive setting” available.
That settlement set other standards for the detention of children. The Trump administration has called for ending the settlement as part of its demands for changes to immigration laws.
Top administration officials have said they believe the asylum process is overwhelmed and challenged by people making frivolous claims. Advocates have also accused border agents of unlawfully turning away people who are seeking asylum at the U.S.-Mexico border.
Michelle Brané, director of the migrant rights and justice program for the Women’s Refugee Commission, said that through attorneys and social service organizations, she had identified at least 426 immigrant adults and children who had been separated by authorities since President Donald Trump took office in January 2017. Brané said she did not have a comparable figure for Obama’s administration.
But Brané said since the new administration began, her office has received far more reports of adults being held in ICE facilities without knowing where their children are.
“A lot of these kids are already afraid because they’re fleeing something and they know they’re fleeing something,” Brané said. “And to have them pulled away, that can be devastating for a parent.”"

Below are questions to help guide your discussions as you read the book over the next month. The questions are broken down by week, or divided into four parts to match your reading speed. (Spoiler alert on the questions that are further down if you read ahead!)
Week One
1. “Exit West” begins with two people meeting in a city “swollen by refugees but still mostly at peace, or at least not yet openly at war” — setting the scene for what’s to come. Throughout the book, as the city descends into war, Hamid never mentions the place’s name. Why?
2. As the book follows its two main characters, Nadia and Saeed, readers also meet a thief in Australia, a suited-man targeting women in Tokyo, and an old man whose house is being surrounded by military men in San Diego, among others. We never meet these characters again. What do you think is the purpose of these interludes?
3. We learn early on that Nadia wears flowing black robes but is not religious. She says she does it so that men won’t disturb her. When she goes to withdraw money from a bank, she is groped in a crowd with “incredible force.” What are we supposed to take away from the scenes about the ways women have to survive in a period of instability?
4. Even as the city descends into war, and events become increasingly scary, Hamid rarely tells us that the characters feel fear. Instead, the reader is left to decipher how the people in the book must be feeling. Why do you think that is?
Week Two
5. Hamid describes windows in people’s houses as a “border through which death was possibly most likely to come,” and the many ways a house has to be rearranged during war to ensure it’s safe. How is the feeling of home as a secure place challenged in this book?
6. After discussing the windows, Hamid introduces the rumors about doors “that could take you elsewhere…” What do we learn about the dangers and promise of these passageways?
7. The militants who take over the city do not allow music, do no not approve of unmarried lovers like Nadia and Saeed, and come looking to kill people of a particular sect. Does this book feel representative of the unrest of our present time, of our past, or both?
8. When Nadia and Saeed learn that the magical doors do exist, and can in fact take them away from the violence of their city, they are excited and immediately pursue an agent to help them leave. Saeed’s father, on the other hand, only says of the doors: “Let us see.’ Does this feel resonant to you of the experience of different generations of migrants?
Week Three
9. Chapter Five ends with Nadia making Saeed’s father a promise to take care of his son, and the line: “That is the way of things, for when we migrate, we murder from our lives those we leave behind.” Is Hamid referring to Saeed’s father and the people we leave behind, or something more?
10. As migrants move through the magical doors to other places, trying to escape war and chaos, the passage they take is described as: “both like dying and like being born.” Does this description feel representative of the experience of people who migrate today?
11. We never hear, though, about what actually happens as people migrate through these doors. Why do you think the migration itself is absent from the narrative?
12. As Nadia and Saeed escape through the doors, we learn that not just their city, but much of the wider world, is in turmoil. Refugees are on the move to Mykonos in Greece and Marin County, near San Francisco. Riots are starting over migrants in Vienna and in London. What do you think Hamid wants us to understand about this global instability?
13. As these cities become more unstable, they also come under greater surveillance, at the hands of unseen authorities. These authorities also control the electricity network and internet connectivity. How do these changes impact the people in the book? How does it feel relevant to today’s world?
Week Four
14. In the cities to which migrants flee, Hamid writes that people began to reassemble with others of their own kind, “like superficially with like.” At one point, even Saeed wants him and Nadia to relocate to live with others like them, though Nadia resists. What do you think is behind this human impulse?
15. As Nadia and Saeed continue to move locations, their relationship becomes increasingly unstable, and the way they speak to each other not as kind. By the end of the book, Hamid writes that they begin “slipping away” from each other, as people all over the world are “slipping away from where they had been.” What does Hamid want us to learn here?
16. And yet at the same time in Amsterdam, two elderly men fall in love. What do you take away from his interlude?
17. The book ends in the city of Nadia and Saaed’s birth, which Hamid writes seems to them both familiar and unfamiliar. How did you feel about this book’s ending?"

Italy’s 2018 national elections could deliver a stable government for the first time since Prime Minister Matteo Renzi stepped down in 2016 after the failure of his reform agenda. But the lead-up to the vote has seen the weakening of traditional parties and the rise of anti-establishment movements, an emerging pattern across the continent.
The outcome will likely have repercussions for the Italian economy, one of the world’s largest, which is still struggling with low growth, high unemployment, and unstable banks. It will also determine the role Italy plays in the European Union as the bloc struggles with further integration, the continuing migration crisis, and a persistent confrontation with Russia.
Italy has been led by a caretaker government since December 2016, when Renzi resigned. Renzi had pressed for constitutional reforms that would have reshaped the legislature, eventually staking his leadership on a referendum on the issue, which Italian voters rejected by a nearly twenty-point margin.
Paolo Gentiloni, a member of Renzi’s center-left Democratic Party (PD) and former foreign minister, was appointed as a temporary prime minister until the next elections. These were scheduled for March 4, 2018.
Front and center is Italy’s role in the migration crisis that has shaken the European Union since 2015. The country’s economic performance has also driven voter dissatisfaction.
Like many other European countries, Italy has seen the rise of anti-establishment, often fringe, political forces. Support for the governing center-left PD has almost halved since the 2013 elections, while the center-right Forza Italia (FI) has needed to form an alliance with several far-right parties to have a chance at forming the next government.
Democratic Party: Since the 2013 elections, the PD passed labor legislation that economists say has created jobs and begun a program of recapitalizing Italy’s banks, but some on the left wing of the party have split with Renzi, weakening his bid to return as prime minister. Renzi remains the party leader, but some observers say that in the case of an inconclusive election, Gentiloni could be reappointed as a compromise choice for head of a grand coalition government.
Coalition of the Right: Former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, who, at age 81, last held office in 2011, has achieved a comeback of sorts by assembling a coalition of right-wing parties. This includes his center-right Forza Italia, which is broadly pro-business. More radical is his ally the Northern League, a party originally devoted to the independence of Italy’s northern regions. Its leader, Matteo Salvini, has rebranded it into a national party based on an anti-immigration and Euroskeptic platform. Salvini has said he would take Italy out of the eurozone, though Berlusconi disagrees.
Five Star Movement: Polls show the most popular party ahead of the elections is the Five Star Movement (M5S), founded in 2009 by comedian Beppe Grillo. The party is an eclectic mix of ideologies and personalities, loosely united by a spirit of protest against Italy’s political establishment, which it sees as corrupt and outmoded. Its leaders have often criticized Italy’s participation in the euro and EU budget rules, and have called for tighter immigration policies.
In 2017, Italy changed its electoral system in a way that experts say makes it harder for any single party to win a majority in parliament. This was meant to encourage coalition building, they say, but could complicate forming a government.
Any party or coalition will likely need more than 40 percent support to win enough seats to govern. None are currently polling above that mark. Berlusconi’s alliance has polled around 35 percent. M5S has polled around 28 percent and Renzi’s PD just over 20 percent.
Berlusconi’s bloc might be forced to form a left-right alliance with the PD to create a broad, centrist coalition. However, a divided vote might also mean a more radical result: depending on the results, the Northern League could try to form its own government, as could, potentially, the M5S. M5S has long ruled out forming an alliance with any other party, but its charismatic young leader, Luigi Di Maio, has softened that stance in the lead-up to the polls.
Any new government could have repercussions throughout Europe. With the UK leaving the union, Italy is poised to become the bloc’s third largest economy, and its ability—or inability—to clean up its banks, return to growth, and put its national debt on a sustainable path will influence the health of other European economies as well as EU monetary and banking policy.
European officials worry especially about the hostility to EU institutions that now animates much of Italian politics. A government led by the Northern League or M5S could see a referendum on Italy’s membership in the eurozone, or a call to renegotiate the European Union’s foundational treaties. Even barring such a dramatic move, a Euroskeptic government would likely throw a wrench in French President Emmanuel Macron’s ambitious plans for deeper European integration.
Finally, most of the opposition contenders hold views on relations with Russia that would represent a sharp break with the status quo. Berlusconi is a close personal friend of Russian President Vladimir Putin. M5S leaders have spoken in support of Russia’s policy in Syria, criticized EU sanctions on Russia over its Crimea annexation, and called for Italy to play a reduced role in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).
Putin’s government has also forged ties with the Northern League, as it has with other right-wing parties across the continent, raising the possibility that the next Italian government will challenge EU unity on its approach to Russia.

https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/china-lifts-xis-term-limit-raising-anxieties-of-return-to-one-man-rule,migrant,1072,2018-02-26T10:38:00-05:00,"Christopher Bodeen, Associated Press",China lifts Xi’s term limit raising anxieties of return to one-man rule,"BEIJING — For some Chinese, their feelings about plans to lift term limits to allow President Xi Jinping to rule indefinitely can be represented best by a cuddly stuffed bear.
Social media users shared images of Winnie the Pooh hugging a jar of honey along with the quote, “Find the thing you love and stick with it.”
The Disney bear’s image has often been compared to Xi, prompting periodic blocks on the use of Pooh pictures online.
Other online commenters wrote, “Attention, the vehicle is reversing” — an automated announcement used by Chinese delivery vehicles — suggesting that China is returning to the era of former dictator Mao Zedong or even imperial rule.
Analysts say the ruling Chinese Communist Party’s move to enable Xi to stay in power indefinitely will ensure some degree of political stability while also reviving the specter of a return to one-man rule.
In a sign of the leadership’s sensitivities, Chinese censors moved quickly Monday to remove satirical online commentary about the development.
A day after the party announced a proposed constitutional amendment ending term limits, internet users found it difficult to signal approval or disapproval by changing their profiles. Key search topics such as “serve another term” were censored.
The country’s rubber-stamp parliament, the National People’s Congress, is all but certain to pass the amendment when it meets for its annual session early next month. Under the 1982 constitution, the president is limited to two five-year terms in office, but Xi — already China’s most powerful leader since Mao — appears to want additional terms to see through his agenda of fighting corruption, eliminating poverty and transforming China into a modern leading nation by mid-century.
Or, some speculated, he may simply wish to retain near-absolute power for as long as possible.
“It is most likely that it will turn into a post of lifelong tenure,” said Zhang Ming, a retired political scientist who formerly taught at Beijing’s Renmin University.
A retired Beijing railroad worker, who gave only his surname, Liu, said he approved of Xi’s performance over his first five years in office and voiced no objection to the lifting of term limits.
“As the leader, he has done pretty well in terms of reform and economic growth,” said Liu, 67. “In foreign policy, he also did a good job by taking tough positions in the face of provocations from the U.S.”
Xi has made robust diplomacy and a muscular military posture in the South China Sea and elsewhere a hallmark of his rule and more can be expected, experts said.
In terms of trade relations with the U.S., entrenched differences between the world’s No. 1 and No. 2 economies will likely remain, said James Zimmerman, former chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in China.
“This announcement on the one hand potentially means continuity, predictability, and stability. But, on the other hand, it also means more of the same; namely, stalled market reforms and limitations on market access,” Zimmerman said.
Professor and political commentator Hu Xingdou said he doubted that Xi wants to be president-for-life, but there were concerns that China could “slide into a kind of fascism or personal dictatorship which will cause very serious consequences.”
“Many consider this a lifetime tenure, but I think it will probably be extended to three or four terms. Maybe an unspoken agreement has been reached inside the Chinese Communist Party that one has to step down after three or four terms,” Hu said.
Others pointed out that authoritarian rule without term limits often leads to abuses and severely complicates the succession process.
In the near term, “this move could actually increase stability, since there would presumably be less jockeying for power,” said William Nee, an Amnesty International researcher on China. “In the long run, however, this will probably further complicate the perennial problem that authoritarian states confront in finding a way to peacefully and orderly transfer power.”
However long Xi wishes to hold on to office, he currently faces little opposition from within the party or mainstream society. Xi already has a firm grip on power as head of the military and party general secretary, a position for which there are no term limits, and has eliminated all challenges to his leadership.
China holds no competitive elections for leadership posts, and the body responsible for reappointing Xi to a second five-year term and amending the constitution next month generally approves the party’s pre-ordained decisions.
Xi appeared to signal his intention at last year’s party national congress by breaking with the convention of appointing an heir-apparent to the all-powerful Politburo Standing Committee.
In addition, Xi has already won two highly significant victories in being named the “core” of the current generation of party leaders, and having his eponymous governing philosophy inserted into the party constitution at last year’s congress.
Recent months have also seen a growing number of references in state media to Xi as “leader,” a minimalist title reserved up until now for Mao. “People love the leader of the people,” read a commentary on the website of state broadcaster CCTV on Monday.
Yet, extending his rule while centralizing power also poses political risks for Xi, making him solely responsible for dealing with knotty problems including the ballooning public debt, an anemic public welfare system, unemployment in the bloated state sector and pushback against China’s drive for regional dominance and global influence.
In recent months, critics have pointed to two major policy missteps.
An effort to cut winter air pollution in the frigid north by slashing coal use had to be reversed after factories were left idle and millions of people shivering in their homes.
Around the same time, a push to clear unregistered residents from Beijing and other cities in the name of safety and social order was roundly criticized for throwing migrant families out of their homes in the dead of winter.
Xi’s rule has been characterized by a relentless crackdown on critics and independent civil society voices such as lawyers netted in a sweeping crackdown on legal activists that began in July 2015.
Following the passage of the constitutional amendment, “there will be even less tolerance of criticism,” said Joseph Cheng, a long-time observer of Chinese politics now retired from the City University of Hong Kong.
“The regime will be even more severe in all kinds of repression,” Cheng said.

Regan,Italian gunman targets immigrants in drive-by shootings,"A gunman shot six African immigrants from his vehicle on Saturday during a 2-hour rampage in the central Italian city of Macerata before he was arrested by police.
The suspect, identified by authorities as Luca Traini, a 28-year-old Italian citizen, left at least one person with life-threatening injuries. Five men and one woman were injured during the shooting spree.
Traini, who police said had no previous arrest record before the shootings, ran a losing bid in local elections last year for the anti-migrant Northern League in the nearby city of Corridonia, about six miles outside Macerata.

The shootings came days after the discovery of a dismembered body in Macerata, identified as Italian teenager Pamela Mastropietro. A 29-year-old Nigerian immigrant is being held on a murder charge after police found several large knives and blood stains in his apartment.
Police did not immediately connect the two incidents, though the city’s mayor, Romano Carancini, said Saturday, “the closeness of these two events makes you imagine that there is a connection.”
Images posted on the website of the Italian newspaper il Resto di Carlino show Traini with an Italian flag draped over his shoulders as he was apprehended by police."
