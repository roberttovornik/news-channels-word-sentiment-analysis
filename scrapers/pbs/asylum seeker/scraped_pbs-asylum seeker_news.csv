The move aims to prevent immigrants from applying for asylum to bide their time and obtain work permits when they don’t qualify for the protection as well as enable those genuinely fleeing persecution in their home countries to settle here, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services said.
More than 300,000 people are waiting for their asylum applications to be reviewed by government officers, compared with 16,000 in July 2012.
Many have been waiting three or four years for an interview, let alone a decision on their cases. While they can obtain work permits during that time, they can’t bring relatives to join them — meaning they may be separated for years from their spouses and children, who can be in danger overseas.
Immigration attorneys said the new plan was absurd and would only result in even longer delays for those in line the longest. They say the government handled cases similarly some years ago before a surge in arrivals on the U.S.-Mexico border, but many applicants didn’t get timely interviews and it didn’t deter people from seeking asylum.
“It is going to create a mess,” said Jason Dzubow, an immigration attorney in Washington. “Whatever number of cases they get per week, they can’t handle it.”
More staffers have been assigned to review asylum requests since the Trump administration scaled back the country’s refugee program, said L. Francis Cissna, director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.
“You have many frivolous cases, you have people who aren’t eligible at all, you have people who filed fraudulent cases, but you also have people with absolutely legitimate claims,” he said in an interview late last year in Los Angeles. “The fact that the backlog is so huge hurts them.”
There are two ways to seek asylum in the United States. Those who arrive on travel, student or other visas can file applications and be interviewed at a government office.
Those whose cases aren’t approved — as well as other immigrants facing deportation — can seek asylum before a judge in immigration court. But the court delays are as long or longer than those in the asylum offices.
The waits create stress and uncertainty for asylum seekers already are coping with learning to live in a new country and separation from family overseas.
A 34-year-old asylum seeker from Syria said he had a hard time getting an engineering job because employers could not tell how long he would be allowed to stay. He was torn about buying a house.
“There is uncertainty all over the place, and you literally are going to die if you go back,” said the man, who came on a student visa and asked not to be named out of fear of reprisals from the Trump administration and the Syrian regime. “You have to figure out all the legal ways, and you have to knock on all the doors.”
The delays may induce some immigrants to apply despite knowing they don’t qualify. They can work legally for several years before facing deportation proceedings and then wait years more for a hearing. Those in the country more than a decade may be able to seek approval for a special green card.
The backlog grew several years ago after tens of thousands of Central American children arrived on the border seeking asylum. Children are entitled to interviews at asylum offices, and the U.S. bumped their cases to the front of the line.
At the end of 2017, asylum officers were interviewing applicants in Southern California who filed their cases almost four years earlier.
The agency is receiving more asylum applications than it wraps up each month. In September, about 8,800 applications were filed and about 5,500 were completed, according to government data.
Immigration lawyers said they have seen asylum seekers divorce after years of separation or become homeless as their money was depleted while waiting for a work permit. The long waits also can weaken their cases if conditions change in their countries or witnesses die.
In some instances, asylum cases get stronger with time. Houman Varzandeh, an immigration attorney in Los Angeles, said his clients who fled religious persecution may have more evidence once they establish themselves in a church community than when they first arrived. But it can come at a tremendous personal price.
“I have people who are now getting divorced — the husband and wife don’t see each other,” he said. “How many years can you spend apart?”"

Goodale visited Emerson, Manitoba, a small border town that has seen some 200 illicit crossings so far this year.
“We all need to work together. We have to have good communication with one another. This is a set of issues that span national, provincial and local responsibilities,” Goodale told reporters at a conference Saturday.
Goodale announced US$22,000 (CA$30,000) to cover extra costs borne by Emerson-Franklin’s volunteer fire department and other agencies in the community, saying more resources will become available.
The Royal Canadian Mounted Police and the Canada Border Services Agency have shifted some resources in southern Manitoba to the Emerson area. The border services agency recently set up a trailer to help process the border-crossers.

The number of illicit border-crossings has jumped in recent months, following the U.S. government’s plans to limit immigration and step up deportations. The Manitoba government has said the influx has created more demand for housing and other support services.
Migrants have been crossing through fields and ditches because, under the Canada-United States Safe Third Country Agreement, they are turned back at official border crossings if they have already made refugee claims in the U.S.
If they get onto Canadian soil before being apprehended, they are allowed to stay in Canada and go through the normal refugee-claim process.
Conservative immigration critic Michelle Rempel has called on the government to ensure migrants who sneak across the border are charged with crossing illegally, but Goodale said they cannot be charged if they make a refugee claim, at least until the claim is dealt with.
“Charges in relation to the crossing of the border cannot be laid until after the case of the particular individual under immigration rules has been finally disposed of,” Goodale said.
He also said the government is examining requests for more aid from refugee support agencies, but did not provide specifics."

The ACLU said late Sunday the administration provided it with a list of 102 children under 5 years old and that “appears likely that less than half will be reunited” by Tuesday’s deadline.

The Justice Department asked U.S. District Judge Dana Sabraw for more time last week but the judge on Friday did not grant a blanket extension, saying only that he would consider certain exceptions. He told the two sides to discuss possible exceptions and report to him Monday. The Justice Department was working through the weekend on a path toward unification and was preparing a progress report for the court.
Children were increasingly separated from their parents after Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced in May that a zero-tolerance policy on illegally entering the country was in full effect. While parents were criminally prosecuted, children were placed in custody of the Health and Human Services Department.
Trump reversed course on June 20 amid an international outcry and said families should remain together.
On June 26, Sabraw set deadlines of Tuesday to reunite children under 5 with their families and July 26 for older children. Sabraw, who was appointed by President George W. Bush, wrote that the “situation has reached a crisis level” and that the “chaotic circumstances” were of the government’s own making.
Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said Thursday there were “under 3,000” children separated from their parents. Previously, he said 2,047.
“It’s extremely disappointing that the Trump administration looks like it will fail to reunite even half the children under 5 with their parent,” said ACLU attorney Lee Gelernt. “These kids have already suffered so much because of this policy, and every extra day apart just adds to that pain.”
The ACLU sued in March on behalf of a Congolese woman who was separated from her daughter for five months after seeking asylum at a San Diego border crossing and a Brazilian asylum-seeker who was separated from her son after an arrest for illegal entry in August near the Texas-New Mexico border.

Hours before a hearing in San Diego, the Justice Department filed papers seeking an extension of the deadline, which is July 10 for parents with children under 5 and July 26 to reunite everyone else.
The administration says federal law requires it to ensure that children are safe and that requires more time. Officials also say that they won’t be able to confirm a child’s parentage by the deadline if DNA testing is inconclusive. They will need more time to collect DNA samples or other evidence from parents who have been released from government custody.
U.S. District Judge Dana Sabraw said he was considering giving the administration until Monday morning to provide the status of the children under 5 who were separated from their parents before he decides whether to extend the deadline.
Of the 101 children under 5, about half are in the custody of Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The others have left the country or were released, according to Justice Department attorney Sarah Fabian. She said it has been more difficult to reunite children when parents are outside government custody.
The judge, who was appointed by President George W. Bush, set the deadline last week, writing that the “situation has reached a crisis level” and that the “chaotic circumstances” were of the government’s own making.
More than 2,000 children were separated from their parents after Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced in May that the zero tolerance policy was in full effect, even if it meant splitting families. While parents were criminally prosecuted, children were placed in custody of the Health and Human Services Department. Trump reversed course on June 20 amid an international outcry, saying families should remain together.

On Thursday, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said less than 3,000 children are believed to have been separated, but that includes kids who may have lost parents along the journey, not just parents who were detained at the border.
About 40 parents of children in the under-5 age group are in Homeland Security custody and another nine are in the custody of the U.S. Marshals Service, the government said in court papers.
Jonathan White, a Health and Human Services official, filed a declaration with the court that gives what is perhaps the most detailed account yet of what the government is doing and the hurdles it faces. Its database has some information about the children’s parents but wasn’t designed to reunify families under the court’s deadline.
The department has manually reviewed the cases of all 11,800 children in its custody by working nights and weekends, White said. The results of that review are being validated.
DNA cheek swab tests on parent and child take nearly a week to complete, said White, who called the risk of placing children with adults who aren’t their parents “a real and significant child welfare concern.”
“The Government does not wish to unnecessarily delay reunifications or burden class members,” the Justice Department filing reads. “At the same time, however, the Government has a strong interest in ensuring that any release of a child from Government custody occurs in a manner that ensures the safety of that child.”

Sabraw’s order in the class-action lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union applies to all families who have been separated and includes a halt to any future separations.
The ACLU sued in March on behalf of a Congolese woman who was separated from her daughter for five months after seeking asylum at a San Diego border crossing and a Brazilian asylum-seeker who has been separated from her son since an arrest for illegal entry in August near the Texas-New Mexico border.
The Congolese woman, identified in court documents as Mrs. L, claimed asylum on Nov. 1, 2017, and four days later was separated from her daughter. The girl, then 6, was sent to a Chicago shelter contracted by Health and Human Services, while the mother was held at a San Diego immigration detention facility until March 6.
The administration says the Congolese woman had no documents and was unable to prove she was the girl’s mother when she claimed asylum. U.S. authorities confirmed through DNA testing on March 12 that the woman was the girl’s mother and the two were reunited.
The Brazilian woman, identified as Mrs. C, served nearly a month in jail after her Aug. 26, 2017, arrest for illegal entry near Santa Teresa, New Mexico, and then spent about six months in immigration detention. Her son was also sent to a Chicago shelter the two recently reunited."

“This policy is relatively new,” said Steven Wagner, an acting assistant secretary at the Department of Health and Human Services “We’re still working through the experience of reunifying kids with their parents after adjudication.”
Federal officials say there are some methods parents can use to try to find their children: hotlines to call and an email address for those seeking information. But advocates say it’s not that simple.

In a courtroom near the Rio Grande, lawyer Efren Olivares and his team with the Texas Civil Rights Project frantically scribble down children’s names, birthdates and other details from handcuffed men and women waiting for court to begin. There are sometimes 80 of them in the same hearing.
The Texas Civil Rights Project works to document the separations in the hopes of helping them reunite with the children.
They have one hour to collect as much information as they can before the hearing begins. The immigrants plead guilty to illegally entering the U.S., and they are typically sent either to jail or directly to an immigration detention center. At this point, lawyers with the civil rights group often lose access to the detainees.
“If we don’t get that information, then there’s no way of knowing that child was separated,” Olivares said. “No one else but the government will know that the separation happened if we don’t document it there.”
Olivares has documented more than 300 cases of adults who have been separated from a child. Most are parents, but some are older siblings, aunts, uncles or grandparents. Some are illiterate and don’t know how to spell the children’s names.
More than 2,000 minors have been separated from their families since early May. The children are put into the custody of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services with the aim of keeping them as close to their parents as possible and reuniting the family after the case goes through the courts, said Wagner.
But it’s not clear that’s working.
According to Olivares, the agency is generally “very willing to help,” often helping to find a child even if there’s a misspelling in the group’s records. But if a child has been transferred out of a government shelter — including if the child has been deported — agency representatives won’t give any information.
“Sometimes the parent gives us contact information for a relative,” Olivares said. “If they have the phone number right and the phone number is working … we call that number and sometimes we’re able to locate that relative and ask them what they know.”
In May, the Department of Justice adopted the zero-tolerance policy in which anyone caught entering the U.S. illegally is criminally prosecuted. Children can’t be jailed with their parents. Instead, after the adult is charged, children are held briefly by Homeland Security officials before being transferred to Health and Human Services, which operates more than 100 shelters for minors in 17 states.
The department has set up new facilities to manage the influx of children, and Wagner said they were prepared to expand as more children come into custody.

The children are classified as unaccompanied minors, a legal term generally used for children who cross the border alone and have a possible sponsor in the U.S. willing to care for them. Most of the more than 10,000 children in shelters under HHS care came to the U.S. alone and are waiting to be placed with family members living in the U.S.
But these children are different — they arrived with their families.
“They should just give the kids back to their parents. This isn’t difficult,” said Lee Gelernt of the American Civil Liberties Union.
Gelernt represents a Brazilian asylum seeker in a closely watched lawsuit that seeks a nationwide halt to family separation. The woman, identified as Mrs. C in court documents, was split from her son for nearly a year after entering the country illegally in August near Santa Teresa, New Mexico.
On Tuesday, Olivares’ team had seven people left to interview with five minutes left. They took down just the names, dates of birth, and countries of origin of the children.
“One woman (said), ‘What about me, what about me?'” Olivares said a few hours later. “She wanted to give us information because she realized what we were trying to do.”

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security said it would refer all arrests for illegal entry to federal prosecutors, throwing its weight behind Sessions’ policy announced last month to vastly expand criminal prosecutions of people with few or no previous offenses. A conviction for illegal entry carries a maximum penalty of six months in custody for first-time crossers, though they usually do far less time, and two years for repeat offenses.
“If you cross the border unlawfully, then we will prosecute you. It’s that simple,” Sessions told reporters on a mesa overlooking the Pacific Ocean, where a border barrier separating San Diego and Tijuana, Mexico juts out into the ocean.
Nearly one of every four Border Patrol arrests on the Mexican border from October through April was someone who came in a family, meaning any large increase in prosecutions is likely to cause parents to be separated from their children while they face charges and do time in jail.
Children who are separated from their parents would be put under supervision of the U.S. Health and Human Services Department, Sessions said. The department’s Office of Refugee Resettlement releases children traveling alone to family and places them in shelters.
“We don’t want to separate families, but we don’t want families to come to the border illegally and attempt to enter into this country improperly,” Sessions said. “The parents are subject to prosecution while children may not be. So, if we do our duty and prosecute those cases, then children inevitably for a period of time might be in different conditions.”
A heckler interrupted Sessions on a megaphone, shouting, “Why are you doing this? Do you have a heart?”

Homan, discussing immigration enforcement actions of the Trump Administration near San Diego, California. Photo by Mike Blake/Reuters
Thomas Homan, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s acting director, said there is no “blanket policy” to separate families as a way to deter others, echoing recent comments by Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen. But he said immigration authorities have long separated families if they have reason to doubt the relationship or if parent is prosecuted.
“Every law enforcement agency in this country separates parents from children when they’re arrested for a crime,” Homan said alongside Sessions. “There is no new policy. This has always been the policy. Now, you will see more prosecutions because of the attorney general’s commitment to zero tolerance.”
Advocacy groups blasted the moves as cruel and heartless, especially in cases where the family is seeking asylum in the United States.
“Criminalizing and stigmatizing parents who are only trying to keep their children from harm and give them a safe upbringing will cause untold damage to thousands of traumatized families who have already given up everything to flee terrible circumstances in their home countries,” said Erika Guevara-Rosas, Amnesty International’s Americas director.
U.S. Rep. Bennie Thompson of Mississippi, the top Democrat on the House Homeland Security Committee, said, “Criminalizing parents seeking protection for themselves and their children is inhumane, excessively punitive, and can deliberately interfere with their ability to seek asylum.”
The American Civil Liberties Union is challenging the practice in a case involving a Congolese asylum seeker who was separated from her 7-year-old daughter for five months and a Brazilian woman who was separated from her 14-year-old son after being arrested and serving nearly a month in jail for illegal entry. At a hearing in San Diego last week, a Trump administration lawyer did not dispute a report in The New York Times that more than 700 children had been taken from their families since October. The attorney, Sarah Fabian, said she couldn’t say whether there was a shift since Trump took office because officials didn’t have historical data.
A sharp increase in prosecutions will strain the court system. Sessions said he has assigned an additional 35 prosecutors and 18 immigration judges to the border regions.

https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/supreme-court-bond-hearings-immigrants,asylum seeker,449,2016-11-30T13:05:51-05:00,"Mark Sherman, Associated Press",Supreme Court weighs bond hearings for detained immigrants,"WASHINGTON — A seemingly divided Supreme Court on Wednesday tried to figure out whether the government can detain immigrants indefinitely without providing hearings in which they could argue for their release.
The justices heard argument in a class-action lawsuit brought by immigrants who spent long periods behind bars, including many who are legal residents of the United States or are seeking asylum.
The issue for the court is whether people the government has detained while it is considering deporting them can make their case to a judge that they should be released.
The case pits the Obama administration against immigration advocates, and the court hearing comes as President-elect Donald Trump has said he will step up deportations.
The San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled for the immigrants, including Mexican immigrant Alejandro Rodriguez, who was detained for more than three years without a bond hearing.
Rodriguez is a legal U.S. resident who was brought to the country as an infant. The Homeland Security Department detained him when it began deportation proceedings because Rodriguez had been convicted of possession of a controlled substance and driving a stolen vehicle, according to the appeals court. He spent no time in jail for the criminal convictions.
In another case, an Ethiopian asylum-seeker was kept in detention partly because a DHS officer wrongly labeled him a Somali, according to the American Civil Liberties Union, which is representing the immigrants.
The 9th Circuit ruled that immigrants generally should get bond hearings after six months in detention, and then every six months if they continue to be held. The government must show why they should remain locked up, the court said.
Justice Stephen Breyer, voicing a sentiment that appeared to be shared by other liberal justices, expressed astonishment that the provisions of immigration law at issue would allow someone released after a hypothetical four-year prison term to be held the same amount of time by U.S. immigration authorities. “How can they be punished for four more years?” Breyer asked.
Acting Solicitor General Ian Gershengorn defended the law, saying Congress clearly gave DHS considerable power to hold people in custody while determining whether to deport them.
Ahilan Arulanantham, the ACLU lawyer representing the immigrants, told the justices the ultimate decision about whether to hold or release people was not at issue before the court. “We’re just talking about the need for an inquiry, the need for a hearing,” Arulanantham said.
But the court’s conservative justices sounded skeptical of Arulanantham’s and the appeals court’s reading of immigration law. “The problem is, that looks an awful lot like drafting a statute or a regulation. … We can’t just write a different statute,” Chief Justice John Roberts said."

A coin flip lands heads three times in a row. What are the odds that it will be heads on the next toss?
A rational decision-maker knows that they are 50-50. But it’s easy to succumb to the belief that streaks don’t occur by chance. This common misperception is known as the gambler’s fallacy. In “Decision-Making under the Gambler’s Fallacy: Evidence from Asylum Judges, Loan Officers, and Baseball Umpires,” Daniel Chen, Tobias J. Moskowitz and Kelly Shue found that in a number of different settings, individuals have a slight bias against deciding the same way in successive cases.
The researchers found, for example, that the odds that a judge rejects an asylum seeker are 3.3 percentage points higher if the judge has approved the previous case, all else being equal. They also noted that the likelihood that judges are influenced by a prior decision increases with the length of the sequence of positive or negative rulings and the similarity of the previous cases.
The researchers also studied loan officers in India. The officers were asked to review loan application files that had already been processed and to make recommendations about whether to approve the loan. They faced different incentive schemes, which placed different degrees of emphasis on an accurate assessment. Because the files had been reviewed previously, the authors could evaluate the quality of the officers’ decisions by examining the actual performance of the loan and exploring whether recommended loans on average were performing better.
Under a flat incentive scheme which rewarded approvals regardless of loan quality, officers — who rejected many loans despite the incentive, perhaps out of intrinsic or reputational motivation — were 8 percentage points less likely to approve the loan currently under review if they had approved the previous loan. This bias became much less significant under plans with stronger incentives for accuracy.

Turning to baseball, the researchers analyzed major league umpires. They examined 1.5 million called pitches when the batter did not swing between 2008 and 2012. They controlled for a wide array of factors, such as pitch count, pitch spin and acceleration, the relative importance of the at bat to the outcome of the game and whether the batter was on the home team. They relied on data compiled by the PITCHf/x system, which tracks the speed and trajectories of pitches in every major league stadium.
They found that umpires were 1.5 percentage points less likely to call a strike if the previous pitch was a called strike. The bias toward an opposite call was also significantly more pronounced when the previous two calls were the same.
Do umpires use subsequent calls to make up for calls they regret? The researchers found that, if anything, umpires were less likely to make an opposite call following an incorrect call than after a correct one. They concluded that, “[F]airness concerns and a desire to be equally nice to two opposing teams are unlikely to explain our results.”

The researchers discovered that the gambler’s fallacy tends to be more evident following longer streaks of decisions in the same direction and when the previous cases have similar characteristics and occur closer in time. It was less evident among more experienced decision-makers.

If there is anything good to be said about my particular line of work, it’s that we get to tell people the news they need to hear, and to put it in context.
To get to that — for one hour every night on the PBS NewsHour, and for an additional half-hour every Friday night on Washington Week, we have to slog through a lot of tough stuff.
We talk to the incarcerated, the drug addicted, the politicians and the policy makers, plus we sit through hours of speeches and committee hearings.
We do this so you don’t have to.
And, occasionally, we glean from you that it’s appreciated. NewsHour executive producer Sara Just received a note this week from viewer Robbie Schaefer, a guitarist, blogger and founder of OneVoice, a program that brings children together through music. We wrote about his program in 2013.
It’s worth it to reprint some of this latest blog here:
Last night my wife and I watched the PBS NewsHour as we do most evenings around 6pm. My youngest son was with us for dinner, so he was watching as well. There was a story about Syrian immigrants waiting and walking in the pouring rain in their struggle to cross Slovenia and Croatia on their way to hopeful asylum in Germany. There was a story about continuing violence between Palestinians and Israelis, including the brutal death of an Eritrean man who was an innocent asylum seeker. He had been mistaken for a terrorist, shot by an Israeli policeman and then kicked and beaten by the crowd while bleeding on the ground. Rage unhinged. Fear will lead us there every time. There was U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, like a decades old recording, calling for an end to the “senseless violence.”
It was enough to ruin your night.
Part of me wanted to turn it all off, make dinner, pet my dogs, watch playoff baseball. A bigger part of me couldn’t. This is the world we live in. All it takes for evil to flourish is for good people to do nothing. And yet, that familiar feeling of helplessness washed over me. I could see it on the faces of my wife and son as well. I got angry. Angry at the world for being this f***ed up. Angry at someone else’s reality intruding on my perfectly comfortable suburban evening. Angry at myself for being angry. And, in short order, anger slid into despair. What to do? Where to start? A facebook posting (or a blog) masquerading as activism is not enough. Not even close.
And that’s when there was a knock on the door.
We live at the end of a cul-de-sac, and this being dinnertime, knocks on the door are uncommon. Isn’t that one of the thin veils we invent to convince ourselves that there is order and civilization in our lives? We don’t interrupt people at dinnertime. Yeah, it’s polite, but it’s also a load of s**t. It turns out an interruption was precisely what was called for here. I opened the door, and there stood Emma, our neighbor’s 8-year-old daughter, with her red Flyer wagon waiting behind her on the sidewalk. There was something about that wagon. Still. Expectant. She explained that she was collecting supplies for people in South Carolina who had lost their homes and most of their belongings in the recent flooding.
Wow. I’d forgotten about that. It was, like, two weeks ago. How quickly I’d moved on from one instance of human suffering to the next.
Toothpaste, toilet paper, shampoo, paper towels. She was going to South Carolina with a group from her school to deliver these things in November. It would be her birthday while she was there, she explained, and she was sad that she wouldn’t be able to have a regular birthday party here at home, but at least two of her friends would be with her and maybe that would be alright.
Emma is the answer.
There’s more. You can read all his blog entries here.
Schaefer’s appeal is in the end a positive one. We need to know what’s happening in the world, but we cannot afford to shrug and walk away.
If we shrug, we don’t get to pick our leaders. If we walk away, we lose out on the interconnectedness that explains our world.
So I’m going to stick that one in my hatband, and set out to tell the stories that shed light and spur action. That way, the bad news can take us to something good."
https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/weeks-long-computer-crash-sends-u-s-immigration-courts-back-pencils-paper,asylum seeker,973,2014-05-23T17:39:56-04:00,Elizabeth Summers,Weeks-long computer crash sends U.S. immigration courts back to pencils and paper,"A catastrophic hardware failure on April 12 disabled the computer system that maintains dockets for the nation’s immigration courts. Six weeks later, the system is still not fully functional.
“Every single thing that we do goes through this docketing system,” said Dana Leigh Marks, president of the National Association of Immigration Judges and a San Francisco-based judge.
From April through May 19, judges were forced to resort to old-fashioned technology, using four-track tape recorders or pencils and paper in the absence of their usual digital audio recording system. Immigrants and family members looking for information on pending cases from the agency’s phone hotline were greeted with a recording that explained that there were no updates “due to system issues.” The 1-800 number went up again this week, but is still “limited to providing information recorded in the electronic database, which our staff will continue to update,” according to a statement on the Department of Justice’s website. The agency did not respond to a request for an interview.
Compared to the Obama administration’s swift public reaction to the HealthCare.gov website snafu, the response to the court system’s crash has been less than urgent, something Judge Marks said she finds “very frustrating.”
“I find it hard to believe that the American government, with the resources it has, couldn’t have found a way to restore the capability faster,” said Marks.
While it is not yet known how many deportation cases were delayed by the network failure, the crash provides a window into the broader problems facing the country’s already severely backlogged immigration courts. According to the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse at Syracuse University, which maintains an ongoing public record of government activity using Freedom of Information Act requests, there were 367,000 pending cases as of March 2014, with the average case taking 578 days to resolve.
“I’m running out of adjectives to try to explain how hard our job is right now,” she said.Marks, who has served as an immigration judge for 27 years, said it’s only logical to think that “antiquated” technology and a lack of resources are at least partly to blame. “I’m running out of adjectives to try to explain how hard our job is right now,” she said. “We were unbelievably saturated before this happened and it just took us to one next level of difficulty.”
Case overload
The nation’s 233 acting immigration court judges are dealing with an average of 1,500 pending cases apiece at any given time, compared to about 440 pending cases for a district court judge. And while district judges commonly employ between two and four full-time judicial law clerks to help summarize cases and research legal issues, one clerk is typically shared among four immigration judges.
Marks, who describes her job as tackling “death penalty cases in a traffic court setting,” said that if a judge makes the wrong decision, such as sending an asylum-seeker back to their home country undeservedly, that person “could go back home and they could be killed — and it has happened. That is the emotional price the judges have to pay.”
For judges who feel overwhelmed by their caseloads already, those daily decisions can be heartwrenching. A 2009 University of California study found that immigration judges suffer from stress levels higher than emergency room doctors or prison wardens. Judges are scheduled to be in court 36 hours a week, with only four hours out of court to read all of the submissions for their weekly caseload. Immigration law is commonly compared to tax law in terms of its complexity, but as Marks points out: “At least with tax law, there’s TurboTax.”
Court advocates say the staffing and budget problems are due partly to the enormous growth of resources for immigration enforcement, with no linkage to the amount of resources devoted to the courts.
Indeed, a recent report by the non-partisan Migration Policy Institute found that while the budgets for Customs and Border Protection and Immigration and Customs Enforcement “have grown dramatically, funding for the work of immigration judges… has not kept pace.” In the past decade, budgets for CBP and ICE rose about 300 percent compared to a 70 percent increase for the Executive Office of Immigration Review, according to the report, and “as a result, judicial removals are a significant choke point in the deportation system.”
A delay tactic, or just a delay?
The computer problems have not generated a coordinated response from either side of the immigration reform debate. Some in favor of increased enforcement have pointed to this slow response time as an example of an administration that doesn’t want to deport people anyway.
But Mark Krikorian of the Center for Immigration Studies, a group that favors stricter limits on immigration, dismissed that notion. “If there was some real angle where the administration could undermine the enforcement of the law this way, I don’t doubt that they would take it,” he said. “I just don’t think that’s what this is.”
Even though the glitches “may help a few people in the sense it will drag their cases out longer,” he added, in the broader sense, “this is no plan cooked up in the White House. It is just simple fecklessness.”
Only time will tell how long it will take to catch up and how many errors occurred during the past five weeks, said Marks, and it’s impossible to know how many materials didn’t get into the system, or how many files failed to make it to the appropriate judges. “It’s not automatically that you flip a switch and we’re completely back up and running.”
Meanwhile, she says, U.S. immigration courts are often the only justice system that foreigners come in contact with while in the United States. “How can we tout us as being the best court system, and one people should emulate, when stuff like this happens?”"

https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/angela-merkel-wont-seek-fifth-term-as-german-chancellor,asylum seeker,817,2018-10-29T10:19:29-04:00,"Geir Moulson, Associated Press",Angela Merkel won’t seek fifth term as German chancellor,"BERLIN — Germany’s Angela Merkel announced Monday that she will step down as head of her conservative party in December after 18 years and won’t seek a fifth term as chancellor in 2021, launching a leadership transition in Europe’s biggest economy.
Merkel has led her conservative Christian Democratic Union since 2000 and Germany since 2005. She put Germany — and Europe — on track toward a new political era after voters punished Germany’s governing parties in a state election Sunday, the latest in a string of woes to hit her fourth-term federal administration.
Merkel currently governs Germany in a “grand coalition” of what traditionally have been the country’s biggest parties — the CDU, Bavaria’s conservative Christian Social Union, and the center-left Social Democrats. Her current coalition took office only in March, after six months of tortuous negotiations, but has become notorious for its squabbling.
The 64-year-old chancellor’s personal popularity remains solid but she appeared keen to launch an orderly transition period amid signs that her authority is eroding. Merkel will now concentrate her energy on keeping her government going until 2021, something that still remains uncertain.
Merkel told reporters in Berlin that she has led the CDU with “passion and dedication” but added “today it is time to start a new chapter.”
That will start with her handing off the party leadership to a successor at a party congress in December.
“This fourth term is my final term as chancellor,” Merkel added. “I will not run as candidate for chancellor in the 2021 election, and will not seek re-election to the German parliament. And, just for the record, I will not aim for any other political office.”
It had been widely assumed this would be Merkel’s final term in office, but the comments were the chancellor’s first public confirmation of that.
For years, Merkel has insisted that the chancellor should also be party leader. But she said Monday that she had decided splitting the two jobs is “justifiable” since she didn’t plan to seek a fifth term as chancellor.
“With this decision, I am trying to contribute to allowing the government to concentrate its strength, finally, on governing well — and people rightly demand that,” Merkel said.
At the same time, she said the CDU will be able “to prepare for the time after me.”
She said she had been mulling her decision for months. Merkel’s one-time mentor, Helmut Kohl, did seek a fifth term in 1998 and lost power after 16 years.
There is precedent for the chancellor not leading his or her party.
Merkel’s predecessor, Gerhard Schroeder, stepped down as leader of his Social Democrats in 2004 as his government struggled, but remained chancellor until he narrowly lost an election 18 months later. Helmut Schmidt, West Germany’s chancellor from 1974 to 1982, never led the Social Democrats.
Two prominent candidates immediately threw their hats in the ring for the CDU leadership. Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, who gave up her job as a state governor earlier this year to become the party’s general secretary, is viewed as an ally of Merkel and largely backs her centrist approach.
And Health Minister Jens Spahn, an ambitious conservative who has talked tough on migration and has criticized Merkel, stands for a more right-wing candidate.
Merkel said she wouldn’t interfere in the choice of her successor.
“Historically, that has always gone wrong and I won’t participate in trying to influence discussions on my successor,” she said. “I see this as an opening, a phase of opportunities.”
Merkel has dragged the CDU to the political center in her years as leader, dropping military conscription, introducing benefits encouraging fathers to look after their young children and abruptly accelerating the shutdown of Germany’s nuclear power plants following Japan’s Fukushima disaster in 2011.
She swung her conservatives behind bailouts for Greece and other struggling eurozone nations, striking a balance between calls for a strict approach at home and more generosity abroad.
In one of her most debated moves, Merkel allowed large numbers of asylum-seekers into Germany in 2015, many of them fleeing the fighting in Syria, declaring that “we will manage it,” before gradually pivoting to a more restrictive approach to migration. That decision has led to lasting tensions in her conservative Union bloc, particularly with Bavaria’s CSU, and helped the far-right anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany party gain support.
At the other end of the spectrum, the traditionally left-leaning Greens have also gained support.
Sunday’s election in the central state of Hesse saw both the CDU and the Social Democrats lose significant ground amid gains for both the Greens and the Alternative for Germany party. Merkel’s party managed an unimpressive win in Hesse, narrowly salvaging a majority for its regional governing coalition with the Greens in the state.
The debacle followed a battering in a state election in Bavaria two weeks ago for the CSU and the Social Democrats.

We take a moment each week to look at what’s happening outside of the Capitol and the White House. Here’s what we’re reading now.
Native American women are going missing at alarming rates, according to an investigation by the Associated Press, which focuses in part on the Flathead Indian Reservation in Montana, seen in this file photo. (Photo by Braunger/ullstein bild via Getty Images)
Native American women are going missing at alarming rates, according to an investigation by the Associated Press.
Last year, Native American women made up more than 0.7 percent of missing cases in the U.S., even though the group represents only 0.4 percent of the population, the AP reported. They are also a group that faces high rates of murder, sexual violence and abuse. According to a 2016 study from the National Institute of Justice, 80 percent of indigenous women have experienced violence in their lifetime.
One of AP’s reports details the case of Ashley HeavyRunner Loring, a 20-year-old woman who disappeared last June inside the Blackfeet Indian Reservation in Montana. More than a year later, the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the FBI, who have both led an investigation into her disappearance, are no closer to answering what happened. Loring’s older sister has organized dozens of searches in the mountains of the reservation. Missing posters continue to be displayed inside the reservation’s grocery stores.
Loring’s case is just one of many across the U.S., reports the Associated Press. [The Associated Press]
Why it matters: Much of the violence against Native women goes unreported. Missing person cases are not often filed, either, in part because of muddled jurisdiction and law enforcement protocols between agencies in and outside the reservations. When a person goes missing on tribal lands, which are considered sovereign nations, the case is referred to tribal police and the Bureau of Indian Affairs. FBI investigators step in in some cases, but when they don’t, tribal access to federal crime information databases is limited.
Federal and state lawmakers have put forward measures to address the problem, including a bill introduced last fall by Sen. Heidi Heitkamp, D-N.D.,that would establish new protocols for the Department of Justice to respond to these cases and increase tribal access to crime databases. More than a year later, the bill is still in committee.

The murder trial for Chicago police officer Jason Van Dyke started with jury selection on Monday. The 40-year-old officer faces six counts of first-degree murder, one count of official misconduct and 16 additional counts of aggravated battery — one for each of the 16 shots fired — in the October 2014 fatal shooting of Laquan McDonald.
Police said McDonald was behaving erratically and holding a knife when he lunged at the officer, prompting the officer to shoot in self-defense. But video released a year later appears to show McDonald walking away from police, sparking widespread protests and ultimately Van Dyke’s trial.
Last week, prospective jurors were asked to fill out questionnaires that included about 125 questions. This week, attorney from both parties and prospective jurors will huddle in a small room next to the Judge Vincent Gaughan’s chambers for the process of jury selection.
The Chicago Tribune noted that this move is a departure from how juries are typically selected — inside a courtroom.
“[Judge Gaughan] believes the more intimate setting makes prospective jurors feel more comfortable answering sensitive questions,” the newspaper wrote, adding that the judge doesn’t want the jurors’ identities public, though attorneys, a small group of journalists and some members of the public will attend the proceedings. [The Chicago Tribune]
Why it matters: Four years after McDonald was shot, “trust in the police remains low, the homicide rate remains high, and new police shootings continue to bring tense protests,” the New York Times wrote this week.
Van Dyke spoke for the first time publicly about the shooting in recent weeks. After giving media interviews in the defense team’s offices, the judge issued Van Dyke a $200 fine, saying the interviews violated a court-imposed rule to not speak about the shooting publicly, the Associated Press reported. In those interviews, Van Dyke said the murder charge against him was political. The Tribune said Van Dyke lamented the “bandwagon of hated” on social media against him. Last week, the judge threatened to hold one of the defense team’s attorneys in contempt for “obstructing the administration of justice.”
After jury selection, the trial is expected to last for at least three weeks. How it plays out could have a notable impact on mistrust between local communities and the police.

Sweden’s growing far-right party, the Sweden Democrats, saw its biggest gains yet in the country’s general election on Sunday. The anti-immigrant party with neo-Nazi roots ended with 17.6 percent of the vote and 63 seats in Sweden’s 349-seat parliament, according to Sweden public Broadcaster STV. That’s up 12.9 percent from the party’s hold in parliament after the last election.
The new surge came at the expense of the country’s two leading blocs. The center-left coalition, led by the ruling Social Democrats, captured 40.6 percent of the vote, and the opposition center-right Alliance, which took 40.3 percent of the vote.
With the remaining votes going to the Sweden Democrats, the far-right party stands in the way for either mainstream coalition to form a majority.
As results rolled in, Jimmie Akesson, the Sweden Democrats’ leader, told supporters at a rally he was willing to negotiate with the parties. But they both have previously said they would be unwilling to engage in talks — painting an uncertain picture of how the parliament’s eight parties will build a working government. [CNN]
Why it matters: Nearly 1 in 5 Swedish voters backed the Sweden Democrats, a party that campaigned hard-line immigration views and crystallized concerns among Swedish voters about crime and economy.
Much like other European countries, frustrations about immigration policy — that in part allowed roughly 163,000 asylum seekers to enter the Sweden in 2015 — fueled the populist party’s rise. Along with reinforcing shift toward ani-immigrant and far-right postures, Sweden’s election also underscored a fragmentation in Europe’s political landscapes — as the Guardian puts it, a “decline of the main parties is making it harder to form coalitions and pursue policies.”

A political battle has ensued over the funding for efforts to recover from historic flooding in India’s Kerala state. The Kerala government has wanted to accept offers of foreign aid, but India’s central government has rejected help from other countries.
The United Arab Emirates, a country with a large population of expatriate Indian workers from Kerala, offered $100 million for flood relief. The offer was (politely) declined.
India “is committed to meeting the requirements for relief and rehabilitation through domestic efforts,” foreign ministry spokesman Raveesh Kumar said in a statement Wednesday night. “The government of India deeply appreciates offers from several countries, including from foreign governments, to assist in relief and rehabilitation efforts after the tragic floods in Kerala,” he continued.
Kerala’s Chief Minister Pinyari Vijayan said Wednesday that “it is only natural for nations to help each other.”
To this point, India’s central government has offered around $85 million in flood relief, about one-fourth of what Kerala has requested. Kerala’s finance minister argued that India’s government should compensate Kerala for the $100 million it rejected from UAE, the Associated Press reported.
Experts have said that the flooding could have been somewhat mitigated if dams were properly managed and began releasing water earlier, the BBC reported. It was only when flooding peaked that water from 80 plus dams was released, which may have actually worsened the flooding.
At least 50 high-power pumps have been deployed in affected areas, along with teams of plumbers and electricians working alongside 50,000 volunteers, the Times of India reported. [Associated Press and Times of India]
Why it matters: As of Aug. 22, the number of deaths caused by torrential rains surpassed 230, according to Reuters. More than 800,000 people were forced into relief shelters.
While floodwaters have slowed and begun receding, much of the state is still filled with slush, caked in mud and littered with debris. Many people in Kerala do not have clean drinking water, and the state is facing drug shortages to address a surge of waterborne diseases.
India has been refusing foreign aid since the 2004 tsunami struck and killed more than 12,000 people. The prime minister at the time set the policy that India would handle its own disasters and would only take aid if it reached out for it, according to The Indian Express.
If extreme weather patterns continue in Kerala, a southern state criss-crossed by a web of 44 rivers, and the Indian government continues to refuse foreign aid, it may complicate future flood relief efforts.
The Ocean Cleanup launched its first ocean trash collector from the San Francisco Bay on Saturday.The Ocean Cleanup / Banjamin Von Wong
A plastic-collecting machine departed the San Francisco Bay on Saturday and will be towed along 1,000 nautical miles until it reaches the Great Pacific Garbage Patch — a massive vortex of garbage collected by ocean currents between Hawaii and California.
The 2,000-foot long plastic-collecting system was developed by the Ocean Cleanup, a nonprofit that estimates its machine will clear half of the vortex’s plastic in the next five years.
Once it reaches the garbage patch and undergoes two weeks of testing, the unit’s giant tubes will be assembled into a U-shape to sit on the surface of the water and redirect debris that passes underneath it. A ship will visit every six weeks, and scoop up the accumulated plastic. If successful, the unit will be a solution to the millions of metric tons that are dumped into the ocean every year. [Business Insider]
Why it matters The Great Pacific Garbage Patch alone holds at least 87,000 tons of plastic and is twice the size of Texas.
While the Ocean Clean Up has deployed a number of prototypes since 2016 to test its plastic-collecting model, the system will be getting its first real test once it reaches the garbage patch.
Some members of the scientific community warn that the system might not be effective at collecting microplastics that make up the majority of oceanic plastic and sink deeper into the water. Others voiced concerns that the unit will pose a risk to marine life, by attracting fish and larger animals that could become entangled.
A preliminary environmental impact assessment commissioned by the Ocean Cleanup found some risk might come to sea turtles genting entangled as they seek shelter under the collected debris. But the report found that generally no serious harm will come to marine life surrounding the contraption.
Other skeptics have simply raised the point that the hyped-up technology will be a distraction from efforts to reduce excessive plastic consumption in the first place."
https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/michael-avenatti-visits-new-hampshire-as-he-considers-2020-bid,asylum seeker,572,2018-08-20T10:38:38-04:00,"Rob Wolfe, Associated Press",Michael Avenatti visits New Hampshire as he considers 2020 bid,"GREENFIELD, N.H. — An attorney who has bedeviled President Donald Trump during the past year over his personal relationships and immigration policies made a presidential pitch of his own to Democratic voters in New Hampshire on Sunday.
Michael Avenatti, who represents adult film actress Stormy Daniels in her case against Trump, told the Hillsborough County Democrats that he was considering matching Trump’s confrontational style with his own pugilistic brand in a 2020 presidential run.
“When they go low, we hit harder,” Avenatti said, modifying a former first lady Michelle Obama slogan.
Avenatti acknowledged that some of the roughly 200 voters at the outdoor barbecue might be thinking, “What is some porn lawyer doing here today?” But, he added, “As you all know, these are anything but usual times.”
Democrats today, he said, are fighting for “nothing short of the survival of our republic.”
Tracing his background, Avenatti said he had grown up in Missouri without a “golden toilet” — an allusion to the Trump family’s wealth — and was the first in his family to graduate from college.
As a trial lawyer, he said, he represented “Davids” against “Goliaths” — and still does now, he said, with his advocacy for Daniels, who says she was coerced into staying silent about her alleged relationship with Trump, and for immigrant families separated by the White House’s crackdown on asylum seekers at the border.

Avenatti has put a toe in the 2020 race, posting a platform on Twitter and recently visiting Iowa, another key primary state that he will soon visit again. On Sunday, he said he was still seriously considering whether to run.
But “what I fear most is that (Democrats) have a tendency to bring nail clippers to a gunfight,” said Avenatti, who has gained notoriety for assailing Trump using the president’s favored medium, Twitter. Speaking to reporters later, Avenatti addressed some Democrats’ concerns about adopting Trump’s tactics, arguing that a successful challenger must be able to counter the president’s provocations. He praised Hillary Clinton’s resume and character, but noted that she lost the 2016 election despite being the most qualified candidate “in U.S. history.”
Avenatti was not the only politician at Sunday’s gathering to use Trump as a motivator for voters. Democratic candidates from county commissioner up to governor sought to tie local Republicans to the president.
Steve Marchand, a former mayor of Portsmouth running for governor, said the Republican incumbent, Chris Sununu, was linked to Trump “by complicity” with his policies on immigration, voter rights and education. Molly Kelly, a former state senator also competing in the Democratic gubernatorial primary, tied Sununu to Education Secretary Betsy DeVos through their support for an educational voucher system, which Kelly said “weakens public education and . will raise property taxes.”
Voters on hand appeared cautiously taken with Avenatti, who received a celebrity reception after arriving Sunday afternoon, stopping every few feet for a selfie photo as he slowly made his way through an energized crowd.
Kathy Boyer, a former law firm clerk from Amherst, said she liked Avenatti’s message and hoped he would prove a viable candidate, despite never having held political office.
“People said the same thing about Donald Trump,” she said. “Look what happened.”

They needed food, clothing, a place to stay and a way to travel to family in the United States. Many were still shell-shocked from weeks in government detention. One father carried an infant who didn’t recognize him after two months apart. A mother held the hand of her 5-year-old daughter, who refused for a time to talk on the phone because she blamed her for their separation.
Scenes such as this are unfolding throughout Texas and Arizona as the Trump administration works to meet a Thursday deadline to reunite immigrant parents and children. The government is releasing hundreds of families to faith-based groups and leaving the groups to care for them.
The Associated Press observed newly reunited families spending their first day together Monday at Catholic Charities of the Archdiocese of San Antonio, which took them in after they were released from custody. The families included children as young as babies and old as teenagers, as well as asylum seekers fleeing violence in Central America and people who were shuttled around the country to various immigrant detention facilities.
___
THE REUNION
Natalia Oliveira da Silva, a mother from Brazil, waited nervously outside the immigration detention center in Pearsall, Texas, for her young daughter, Sara. She soon spotted the 5-year-old coming in a vehicle, a seatbelt over her chest.
Sara got out and was quickly in her mother’s arms, asking her, “They’re not going to take you away again, right?”
Since their separation in late May, the girl had been at a shelter for immigrant minors in Chicago, while Oliveira was moved through facilities across Texas.
Like other families reunited at Pearsall, Oliveira and her daughter were taken to Catholic Charities in San Antonio, about an hour’s drive away. Charity workers checked them into a hotel Sunday night and picked them up Monday morning, along with another immigrant family.
Oliveira, 30, had not slept the night before. Instead, she said, she watched Sara sleep next to her in bed.
At one point while they were detained, Sara refused to talk to her on the phone. She thinks it’s because Sara was angry about what had happened. She’s still angry herself.
“I hope she doesn’t have any memories of this,” Oliveira said.
___
THE DROP-OFF
When Oliveira and her daughter arrived at the Catholic Charities office, two people held open the doors and said “hola.” Inside, volunteers were folding donated clothes and preparing for the day ahead. A local restaurant had dropped off a catered meal of tortillas, beef and grilled vegetables. In a conference room upstairs, parents could pick from shopping racks of clothes and boxes of toys for the children.
U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement had notified Catholic Charities in the morning to expect seven families to be dropped off. Catholic Charities also takes in families that ICE drops directly at the local bus station, but who might otherwise have to stay there overnight or change several buses to reach their destination. Volunteers from a local interfaith group keep watch at the station for immigrant families and call Catholic Charities when they see them.
Drop-offs usually happen in the afternoon or early evening. But the first time that ICE sent families to Catholic Charities, two weeks ago, it didn’t release families until around 3 a.m. And Catholic Charities once found the families it was expecting to receive dropped off at the bus station instead.
“The logic behind how they decide that, we don’t know,” said Matthew Martinez, the group’s vice president of administration.
Caseworkers purchase plane tickets for families and have phones available to call the friend or relative sponsoring them. They also provide hotel rooms for families waiting for buses or planes.
To fund the effort, Catholic Charities has raised $127,000 and received the help of more than 300 volunteers.

THE BONDING
After the reunions, the mood inside the waiting area brightened from somber to joyful.
A group of boys started to play with a foam soccer ball. The younger children played with toy trucks and guitars. Parents holding their children laughed and swapped stories about where they were headed next. Most families were headed to distant locations, from California to Florida.
Many told horror stories about their ordeals, all while cherishing the fact that they had their children back.
Carlos Fuentes Maldonado of Honduras held his 1-year-old daughter, Mia. She and her 4-year-old sister had been taken to a shelter in Arizona shortly after they had tried to cross the Rio Grande about two months earlier. Their mother, Jennifer Maradiaga, said Mia was still breast-feeding at the time they crossed and she was taken away.
When they got her back Monday, the little girl didn’t immediately appear to recognize them, Fuentes said. By the evening, she was nestled on her father’s shoulder.
Around 8 p.m., Maradiaga’s mother and brother arrived to pick them up and take them home. Her mother began to cry as they hugged, holding her daughter’s cheek against hers for several seconds. The members of the family smiled and laughed, taking turns holding Mia.
Other parents recalled how the food in adult detention facilities was sometimes inedible and that detention officers disregarded their complaints or requests. Two mothers said officers told them they might never see their children again. They were watching Spanish-language television when they learned of the Trump administration’s announcement that it would end mass separations.
“Seeing the protests gave us all encouragement,” said Ildra Medrano Castillo, who brought her 9-year-old son from Guatemala. She said an officer at one facility told her son would be put up for adoption.
They had been reunited a few hours before and sat together, eating lunch. Her eyes filled with tears and she laughed when asked what that moment was like.
“It was wonderful,” she said.
___
THE TRIP
The group’s staff took other families to nearby hotels to await their flights the next day. Staff members instructed the families how to use the elevator, since some have never been in one before.
The first wake-ups were at 2 a.m. Tuesday, for a 5 a.m. departure.
“They were tired, but they were happy. They were excited,” said Thelma Gutierrez, the director of one of Catholic Charities’ local shelters for immigrant children.
The parents had their boarding passes and packets of information, along with an information card written in English that they could show if they needed help along the way. Some of them were nervous about what a flight would be like, Gutierrez said.
The staff did several rounds of drop-offs at the airport before dawn, taking a total of 32 people.
“We’re going to do what’s right for them,” Gutierrez said. “For now, this is all we can do.”

His worst fears never came true.
Martinez pleaded guilty to illegal entry on Wednesday — the day President Donald Trump ordered an end to the separating of families — and, while he wasn’t kept under the same roof as his son, they were held in the same compound. They were reunited on Saturday, after five days apart, and were released into the U.S., a tracking device on Martinez’s ankle, while he pursues asylum.
“I was very worried even though we were never really separated,” he said in McAllen’s Greyhound station, as he and his son were about to board a bus to Atlanta to join a friend.
The McAllen station, a hub in the busiest U.S. corridor for illegal crossings, looks much as it did before the administration began enforcing a “zero-tolerance” policy in early May of prosecuting every illegal entry. The policy resulted in the separation of more than 2,300 children before Trump reversed course in the face of an international outcry and said families will remain together.
On a typical day, more than 100 asylum-seekers are released from McAllen-area holding facilities, clutching their belongings in clear plastic bags stamped with Department of Homeland Security logos, said Norma Pimentel, executive director of Catholic Charities of the Rio Grande Valley.
They are led by volunteers to the charity’s headquarters a few blocks away to shower, eat and rest — though volunteers’ first order of business is to distribute shoelaces because they are confiscated from immigrants in custody to prevent suicides.
“Every day is like this. It never ends,” Pimentel said as children played with toys on the floor while adults in ankle monitors sat in rows of plastic chairs. Federal authorities have for years used electronic monitoring devices to keep track of immigrants released while they await further court proceedings.
Still, McAllen, a city of 130,000 people in Texas’ Rio Grande Valley, is just a snapshot of the situation along the border, where Trump’s reversal on family separation has sown chaos and uncertainty and there has been little guidance from the administration.
It is not clear how many asylum-seekers are still entering the country, how many are being detained as families, and how many are being released. Nor it is known how long it will take for all parents and guardians to be reunited with their children.
Homeland Security said late Saturday that 522 youngsters have been reunited since they were separated under the zero tolerance policy and that it has established a process to ensure that family members know where their children are and can communicate with them.
It said that 2,000-plus children remain separated but that the government knows where all them are and is working to reunite them with their families.

Trump vented his frustration over the crisis in a tweet Sunday, saying border crossers shouldn’t be entitled to a day in court.
“We cannot allow all of these people to invade our Country,” the president wrote. “When somebody comes in, we must immediately, with no Judges or Court Cases, bring them back from where they came. Our system is a mockery to good immigration policy and Law and Order.”
Federal authorities are readying a special reunification center at a remote detention center in Port Isabel, about 55 miles (88 kilometers) east of McAllen.
About 70 families arrived at the Catholic Charities’ McAllen shelter late Saturday afternoon, and nearly all were gone by the following day, boarding buses to cities across the U.S.
Pimentel said most of Saturday’s arrivals were not charged criminally but she didn’t believe it signaled a change in the Trump administration’s policy of prosecuting every illegal entry.
Authorities have moved to detain more people, even asylum-seekers, but is constrained by lack of detention space, particularly for families. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has a total of about 3,300 beds at three family detention centers in Texas and Pennsylvania.
“They have a limit as to how much they can manage, and that’s maybe a determining factor in how many are released that day,” Pimentel said.
Patricia Lozano, 27, said she fled Honduras to find a higher-paying job and better support her three children, ages 6, 8 and 9. She was not charged criminally and never separated from her children.
She was on a grueling monthlong bus trip through Mexico when she learned that families were being separated, but she decided to take her chances.
“I was already on the journey,” she said as she waited for a bus to Los Angeles to join family. “Everything turned out OK walking with God.”
Abel, a 40-year-old coffee farmer from Jutiapa, Guatemala, asked for asylum at the U.S. border for himself and his 17-year-old son, Hugo. They were taken into custody Thursday, separated in the same detention center for two days, then reunited and released on Saturday.
He said he left his homeland because gangs were forcing his son to join their ranks. He asked that their last names not be used because he didn’t want to endanger his wife and five daughters back home.
Abel said the word is out that families may be separated at the border.
But “necessity always makes you take risks,” he said. He added of Trump: “The president says it will stop, but people keep coming.”

Let us add some clarity, to the degree we can. Here are a few things we know and don’t know about this policy action, which was initiated by President Donald Trump.
1. So far more than 2,000 children, of all ages — including infants — have been separated from parents due to the Trump administration’s “zero tolerance” policy, which prosecutes everyone who enters the country illegally. United States Customs and Border Protection has put the number at 2,235 children separated from their families between May 5 and June 9. That amounts to an average of 65 kids a day. The Department of Health and Human Services, the agency tasked with caring for the children, told the NewsHour today there is no blanket policy ensuring infants and toddlers stay with parents. The agency says their fate is decided on a discretionary, case-by-case basis.
2. Many of those parents are breaking the law. Other than asylum seekers (see below), parents illegally entering the country are committing a crime, and the federal government can prosecute them as criminals. The White House argues it is a core duty of the president to execute the law fully. The president does have discretion in how that happens, however. Previously, most cases went to civil immigration courts. Now parents are charged as felony criminals, triggering separation from their children. Though the Obama administration did separate some families, that was the exception. It is now the rule.
3. Families are a minority of undocumented immigrants caught in U.S. The United States Border Patrol apprehended 310,531 people in 2017. Of those, the agency estimated that 75,802, or 24 percent, were family units.
4. Undocumented immigrants had a high rate of making court hearings after release. Republicans argue that previous policies provided an enormous loophole, because undocumented families who were released into the interior of the country pending their immigration hearings would skip their court hearings and remain in the U.S. But at least one thorough study shows the opposite is true. Syracuse University’s Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse (TRAC) found that in 2015, 86 percent of immigrants released from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention did show up at their court hearing afterward. That number is even higher for undocumented mothers; 97 percent of them complied with all requirements in the three years after their release.
5. The vast majority of families crossing the border are actual families. The Trump administration has said it’s concerned about smugglers posing as families. But the chief patrol agent at U.S. Border Patrol confirmed today that there were just 148 cases of fraud by those pretending to be family units from last October through April. That’s out of tens of thousands of border crossings.
1. Are families applying for asylum also being separated? The administration insists they are not. But those on the ground say it is happening. It is not clear if this is a case of staff confusion or White House obfuscation on how it’s handling asylum seekers.
2. How many infants and toddlers have been separated from parents? And how does the U.S. government make sure kids who can’t speak yet are returned to a true family member? Neither Customs and Border Protection nor the Department of Health and Human Services could answer the NewsHour’s questions today about how many of the youngest kids are being held in shelters. It is also not clear how kids too young to communicate are being reunited with parents.
3. How long will these kids be in shelters? (And how long will it take parents to reunite with them?) HHS could not answer questions today about the percentage of separated kids who have been reunited with their parents, nor how long it takes for the reunification to happen. An official with the agency told reporters, “the policy is new” and added that “we are still working through this.”
4. Where will DHS and HHS keep all these children? Lawmakers are discussing possible funding for increased beds and facilities, but it is not yet clear how many will be needed. The HHS official who spoke with reporters today said the agency is trying to stay ahead of demand, but also said they hope that the numbers will decrease as families are deterred from trying to enter the country. So far, there is no evidence of a deterrence effect.
5. How will this end? It is far from clear, and it may take many months or more to reach a resolution. Democrats point out that the president could reverse the policy himself, but Trump has said he wants Congress to act and permanently fix the incongruity he sees in immigration law. At this moment, Republicans in Congress are debating different plans to detain families together. Democrats are highly resistant to that idea and would like families to be released while they wait for the immigration process to play out. Those differences seem hard to square. A possible leverage point could come in September. Government funding runs out Sept. 30, and both sides could use that deadline to push for their immigration ideas."

It’s also a situation that has been brewing since the week President Donald Trump took office, when he issued his first order signaling a tougher approach to asylum-seekers. Since then, the administration has been steadily eroding protections for immigrant children and families.
“They’re willing to risk harm to a child being traumatized, separated from a parent and sitting in federal detention by themselves, in order to reach a larger policy goal of deterrence,” said Jennifer Podkul, director of policy at Kids in Need of Defense, which represents children in immigration court.
To those who work with immigrants, the parents’ plight was heralded by a series of measures making it harder for kids arriving on the border to get released from government custody and to seek legal status here.
The administration says the changes are necessary to deter immigrants from coming here illegally. But a backlash is mounting, fueled by reports of children being taken from mothers and distraught toddlers and elementary school age children asking, through tears, when they can see their parents.

About 2,000 children had been separated from their families over a six-week period ending in May, administration officials said Friday.
Among the parents caught up in the new rules is 29-year-old Vilma Aracely Lopez Juc de Coc, who fled her home in a remote Guatemalan village after her husband was beaten to death in February, according to advocates. When she reached the Texas border with her 11-year-old son in May, he was taken from her by border agents, she said.
Her eyes swollen, she cried when she asked a paralegal what she most wanted to know: When could she see her son again?
“She did not know what was going on,” said paralegal Georgina Guzman, recalling their conversation at a federal courthouse in McAllen, Texas.
Similar scenarios play out on a daily basis in federal courtrooms in Texas and Arizona, where dozens of immigrant parents appear on charges of entering the country illegally after traveling up from Central America. More than the legal outcome of their cases, their advocates say, they’re worried about their children.
Since Trump’s inauguration, the administration has issued at least half a dozen orders and changes affecting immigrant children, many of them obscure revisions. The cumulative effect is a dramatic alteration of immigration policy and practice.

The measures require a senior government official to sign off on the release of children from secure shelters and allow immigration enforcement agents access to information about sponsors who sign up to take the children out of government custody and care for them.
The crackdown expanded in April, when the administration announced a “zero tolerance” policy on the border to prosecute immigrants for entering the country illegally in the hopes they could be quickly deported and that the swift deportations would prevent more people from coming.
Parents are now being arrested and placed in quick federal court proceedings near the border. Since children cannot be jailed in federal prisons, they’re placed in shelters that have long existed for unaccompanied immigrant children arriving on the border alone.
The administration insists the new rules are necessary to send a message to immigrants.
“Look, I hope that we don’t have to separate any more children from any more adults,” Attorney General Jeff Sessions said last week. “But there’s only one way to ensure that is the case: It’s for people to stop smuggling children illegally. Stop crossing the border illegally with your children. Apply to enter lawfully. Wait your turn.”
Immigration on the southwest border has remained high since the zero-tolerance policies took effect. Border agents made more than 50,000 arrests in May, up slightly from a month earlier and more than twice the number in May 2017. About a quarter of arrests were families traveling with children.
In addition to those trying to cross on their own, large crowds of immigrants are gathered at border crossings each day to seek asylum. Some wait days or weeks for a chance to speak with U.S. authorities. On a Texas border bridge, parents and children have been sleeping in sweltering heat for several days awaiting their turn.
Under U.S. law, most Mexican children are sent back across the border. Central American and other minors are taken into government custody before they are mostly released to sponsors in the United States.
The arrival of children fleeing violence in Central America is not new. President Barack Obama faced an even larger surge in border crossings that overflowed shelters and prompted the authorities to release many families. Nearly 60,000 children were placed in government-contracted shelters in the 2014 fiscal year.
Obama administration lawyers argued in federal court in Los Angeles against the separation of parents and children and in favor of keeping in family detention facilities those deemed ineligible for release.
Immigrant and children’s advocates said the new measures are not only cruel but costly. They argued that children fleeing violence and persecution in El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras will continue to come to the United States and remain in government custody longer, costing taxpayers more money.
The government pays more than $1 billion a year to care for unaccompanied immigrant children, Sessions has said.
In May 2014, the average length of stay for children in custody was 35 days. So far this fiscal year, it’s taking 56 days for children to be released to sponsors — in most cases, their own relatives.
Many children were released to sponsors who did not have legal immigration status. That’s yet another concern child advocates now have since the Trump administration is requiring fingerprints of sponsors and their household members and will turn that data over to the immigration agency in charge of deportations.
Advocates say the new information sharing might lead some parents to shy away from sponsoring their own children and ask others to do so, a situation that can lead to cases of trafficking or neglect.
Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, legal director of the immigrant advocacy program at the Legal Aid Justice Center in Virginia, said he’s never worked with immigrants who said U.S. policies influenced their decision to move. They are fleeing violence and persecution, and he doesn’t see that changing even if the government deports parents.
“Look six months out from now,” he said. “Are these moms going to stay in Guatemala? Hell no, they’re going to come back looking for their kids.”"

The figures show that 1,995 minors were separated from 1,940 adults from April 19 through May 31. The separations were not broken down by age, and included separations for illegal entry, immigration violations or possible criminal conduct by the adult.
Under a “zero tolerance” policy announced by Attorney General Jeff Sessions, Department of Homeland Security officials are now referring all cases of illegal entry for criminal prosecution. U.S. protocol prohibits detaining children with their parents because the children are not charged with a crime and the parents are.
Sessions announced the effort April 6, and Homeland Security began stepping up referrals in early May, effectively putting the policy into action.
Since then, stories of weeping children torn from the arms of their frightened parents have flooded the media and the policy has been widely criticized by church groups, politicians and children’s advocates who say it is inhumane. A battle in Congress is brewing in part over the issue.

Some immigrant advocates have said women were being separated from their infants — a charge Homeland Security and Justice officials flatly denied. They also said the children were being well cared for and disputed reports of disorder and mistreatment at the border.
On Thursday, Sessions cited the Bible in defending the policy, arguing the recent criticisms were not “fair or logical and some are contrary to law.”
“I would cite you to the Apostle Paul and his clear and wise command in Romans 13, to obey the laws of the government because God has ordained them for the purpose of order,” he said.
The new figures are for people who tried to enter the U.S. between official border crossings. Asylum seekers who go directly to official crossings are not separated from their families, except in specific circumstances — such as if officials can’t confirm the relationship between the minors and adults, if the safety of the children is in question, or if the adult is being prosecuted.
There were an additional 38 minors separated at ports of entry in May through June 6. There were more than 55 in April and a high of 64 in March, according to the figures."
https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/house-republicans-are-working-on-a-fix-for-family-separation,asylum seeker,749,2018-06-12T14:16:12-04:00,Lisa Desjardins,House Republicans are working on a fix for family separation,"Key House Republicans trying to forge an immigration deal have agreed to work on a legislative fix to end family separation for asylum seekers, among other issues facing immigrants, multiple GOP offices involved in the negotiations told the PBS NewsHour.
Republicans are trying to forge an internal compromise on border security and the fate of so-called “Dreamers,” or people brought to the U.S. illegally as children.
The latest development is a sign of rising concern for families and children affected by immigration policy. But despite some areas of unity, GOP conservatives and moderate have not been able to agree on a final deal, several sources involved in the process said. The opposing factions were set to meet Tuesday evening, but multiple offices involved were not optimistic a deal would emerge.
This means moderates are likely to trigger what’s known as a “discharge petition” that could force other immigration votes in two weeks. Here’s what we know.
The issue of family separation entered the Republican talks in recent days amid increased media attention.
In May, the Trump administration began enforcing its new “zero-tolerance” policy, which charges adults crossing illegally as felons in criminal court. Previously, the federal government’s default position had been to charge them in civil court and detain them in immigration facilities. Felony criminal charges, instead, send the adults to prison and trigger automatic separation from their children at that point.
It is not yet clear how many families have been separated as a result of the policy. In May, a Customs and Border Patrol official told a Senate committee that in the first two weeks of the Trump administration’s “zero-tolerance” policy, “658 children with 638 adults” were placed in the prosecution process. It’s unclear how many of these 638 children were separated from their guardians. But advocates placed the figure at hundreds or thousands.
Negotiators are circling around ideas that would ensure that families seeking asylum are not divided while their cases are being processed.
READ MORE: What happens when a child arrives at the U.S. border?
That is not simple. But even more complicated are discussions over how to keep families intact after they’ve been apprehended for crossing illegally but have not initiated the asylum process. There is concern among GOP lawmakers about how to determine whether family members are really related, and when human traffickers may be forcing children to pretend they are part of a family in order to enter the country.
In implementing the “zero-tolerance” policy, the Trump administration cited a 1997 Clinton-era agreement known as the “Flores Settlement,” which requires the federal government to release and not detain immigrant children. But the offices of multiple House GOP lawmakers involved in the current negotiations said they do not believe the Flores rule was intended to separate families.

The inclusion of family separation comes at a critical hour for the all-Republican talks in the House. Moderates pledged that if no acceptable deal was hammered out by Tuesday, they would activate what’s known as a discharge petition, joining Democrats to go around GOP leadership and force votes on other immigration measures.
Such a petition would go into effect if it receives signatures from a majority — or 218 — members of the House.
“There will either be a deal today, or we will hit 218 signatures on the discharge petition,” a spokeswoman for Rep. Jeff Denham, R-Calif, one of the moderate leaders involved in the talks, wrote in an email Tuesday.
As of Tuesday morning, the petition had 215 signatures, but sources told the NewsHour that at least two other House members had committed to sign.
By midday, it looked increasingly likely that the discharge petition would be triggered by the end of the Tuesday. Multiple sources said negotiators were making progress, but that many details remained unresolved.
A discharge petition would launch a potential series of votes on four immigration-related bills — ranging from conservative to moderate proposals — starting on June 25.
But even if the discharge petition is triggered, it could be overridden should a separate immigration deal emerge with wide House Republican support.
Should any bill survive the House process, it would face an uncertain fate in the Senate.

“Generally, claims by aliens pertaining to domestic violence or gang violence perpetrated by non-government actors will not qualify for asylum,” Sessions wrote in 31-page decision. “The mere fact that a country may have problems effectively policing certain crimes — such as domestic violence or gang violence — or that certain populations are more likely to be victims of crime, cannot itself establish an asylum claim.”
The widely expected move overruled a Board of Immigration Appeals decision in 2016 that gave asylum status to a woman from El Salvador who fled her husband. Sessions reopened the case for his review in March as the administration stepped up criticism of asylum practices.

Sessions took aim at one of five categories to qualify for asylum – persecution for membership in a social group – calling it “inherently ambiguous.” The other categories are for race, religion, nationality and political affiliation.
Domestic violence is a “particularly difficult crime to prevent and prosecute, even in the United States,” Sessions wrote, but its prevalence in El Salvador doesn’t mean that its government was unwilling or unable to protect victims any less so than the United States.
Sessions said the woman obtained restraining orders against her husband and had him arrested at least once.
“No country provides its citizens with complete security from private criminal activity, and perfect protection is not required,” he wrote.
The government does not say how many asylum claims are for domestic or gang violence but their advocates said there could be tens of thousands of domestic violence cases in the current immigration court backlog.
Karen Musalo, co-counsel for the Salvadoran woman and a professor at University of California Hastings College of Law, said the decision could undermine claims of women suffering violence throughout the world, including sex trafficking.
“This is not just about domestic violence, or El Salvador, or gangs,” she said. “This is the attorney general trying to yank us back to the dark ages of rights for women.”
Sessions sent the case back to an immigration judge, whose ruling can be appealed to the Justice Department’s Board of Immigration Appeals and then to a federal appeals court, Musalo said. She anticipates other cases in the pipeline may reach the appeals court first.
U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, a California Democrat, said the decision was “despicable and should be immediately reversed.” And 15 former immigration judges and Board of Immigration Appeals members signed a letter calling Sessions’ decision “an affront to the rule of law.”
“For reasons understood only by himself, the Attorney General today erased an important legal development that was universally agreed to be correct,” the former judges wrote. “Today we are deeply disappointed that our country will no longer offer legal protection to women seeking refuge from terrible forms of domestic violence from which their home countries are unable or unwilling to protect them.”
The decision came hours after Sessions’ latest criticism on the asylum system in which he and other administration officials consider rife with abuse. The cases can take years to resolve in backlogged immigration courts that Sessions oversees and applicants often are released on bond in the meantime.
An administration official said last month that the backlog of asylum cases topped 300,000, nearly half the total backlog. Despite President Donald Trump’s tough talk on immigration, border arrests topped 50,000 for a third straight month in May and lines of asylum seekers have grown at U.S. crossings with Mexico.
“Saying a few simple words — claiming a fear of return — is now transforming a straightforward arrest for illegal entry and immediate return into a prolonged legal process, where an alien may be released from custody into the United States and possibly never show up for an immigration hearing,” Sessions said at a training event for immigration judges. “This is a large part of what has been accurately called ‘catch and release.'”"

Trump said that every time someone tries to come into the U.S. illegally from one of the countries that receives aid, “We’re going to deduct a rather large” amount of money. He added, “We’re looking at our whole aid structure.”
READ MORE: What’s behind the Trump administration’s crackdown on MS-13?
Trump has previously accused countries like Mexico of failing to do enough to help the U.S. prevent illegal border crossings.
The president also defended his description last week of MS-13 gang members as “animals” to describe some people who enter the country illegally, in response to a comment about MS-13. Trump says he will continue to use the term in referring to the gang.
He stated that he was met with “rebuke” from Democrats who said the gang members are people. Trump specifically mentioned House Minority leader Nancy Pelosi.
“They’re not people. These are animals and we have to be very, very tough,” Trump said.
Pelosi had commented more broadly on Trump’s rhetoric and policies on immigrants.
WATCH: Trump says he’ll keep using ‘animals’ to describe gang members
MS-13 has been blamed for some two dozen killings on Long Island the past two years. MS-13, or the Mara Salvatrucha, is believed by federal prosecutors to have thousands of members across the U.S., primarily emigrants from Central America. It has a stronghold in Los Angeles, where it emerged in the 1980s as a neighborhood street gang, but it also has wreaked violence in cities and suburbs across the U.S., including Long Island.
The White House released a fact sheet Monday morning titled “WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THE VIOLENT ANIMALS OF MS-13.”
Trump has used the violence to bolster the urgency of his push to overhaul the nation’s immigration laws, as well as the need to build a border wall with Mexico and enact tougher travel restrictions. He’s also argued for loosening restrictions on law enforcement, encouraging police officers whom he calls “rough guys.”
“Please don’t be too nice,” he told law enforcement officials in a similar trip he made to Long Island last July.
The president has called for an end to “catch-and-release” policies, which generally refers to the release of unauthorized immigrants while they await immigration hearings instead of keeping them in custody as well as changes ro rules governing minors and asylum seekers.
Gidley claims the policies “allow hundreds of thousands of illegal and unauthorized aliens to gain entry and release in the United States” and says they can be exploited by violent gangs, cartels, and drug dealers.
Many teenagers on Long Island have been held on gang accusations, swept up in various federal investigations. But immigration advocates say some teenagers arrested in the crackdowns in New York and California have been unfairly tied to gangs and wrongly held at detention centers.
Trump will also attend a fundraiser in his hometown of New York City on Wednesday evening. The 75-person dinner is expected to raise $5 million for the Republican National Committee and the president’s re-election campaign, the RNC said."

Where did these numbers come from? Environmental economists Wolfram Schlenker and Anouch Missirian arrived at these figures by combining asylum-application data with NASA projections on future earth warming. The pair from Columbia University looked at applications to 103 EU nations, filed between 2000 and 2014, and temperature variations in the home countries of those who applied. They found when severe fluctuations in temperatures happened, throwing off the optimal conditions for agriculture, asylum applications increased as a result.
Why it matters: “Our findings highlight the extent to which countries are interlinked, and Europe will see increasing numbers of desperate people fleeing,” Schlenker said. This comes at a time when “Europe is already conflicted about how many refugees to admit.”
Greenhouse gases, by nature, cross geographic borders, and Schlenker told the NewsHour that developing countries will be impacted more severely by climate change, resulting in a human spillover into more resilient nations.

While the future extent of global warming is hard to guess, Schlenker said the best case scenario for emissions would limit warming to 1.8 degrees Celsius. But based on their predictions, asylum applications to the EU would still increase 28 percent — 98,000 extra applications annually.
The EU received 1.2 million applications from first-time asylum seekers in 2015, a record setting number and more than double the year prior. What’s more, about half of Europe’s asylum applicants from 2015 to 2016 still had decisions pending at the end of 2016.
“These findings will be especially important to policymakers since they show that climate impacts can go beyond the borders of a single country by possibly driving higher migration flows,” said Juan-Carlos Ciscar, an economics and climate expert at the European Commission’s Joint Research Centre, who wasn’t involved in the study.
What’s next: Solomon Hsiang, an economist at University of California Berkeley who has linked drought cycles to increased violence, predicts new institutions will be needed to manage the flow of climate asylum seekers.
On December 12, the two-year anniversary of the Paris climate agreement, leaders from across the Americas, including California Governor Jerry Brown, gathered in Ontario, Canada for the launch of Carbon Pricing in the Americas, to discuss carbon policies that work towards a low-carbon future.
The Trump administration spent much of 2017 pulling back on international climate commitments. In June, President Trump removed the U.S. from the Paris climate agreement, which aims to keep the Earth’s warming under 2 degrees Celsius by curbing greenhouse gas emissions. In November, Syria joined the Paris agreement, leaving the U.S. — the second largest carbon emitter in the world — as the sole country opposed to the climate accords.

Scott Pruitt, head of the Environmental Protection Agency, began the process of repealing the Clean Power Plan, an Obama-era rule meant to curb carbon emissions at U.S. power plants. In addition, the Trump administration revised the social cost of carbon — the socioeconomic price of emitting one ton of carbon into the air. Under Obama, the cost was $36 per ton emitted, but Pruitt’s EPA revised the price down to $1 and $6 per ton.
“The World Bank Group stands ready to support countries in the Americas as they work together to implement carbon pricing for ambitious climate action,” Jim Yong Kim, President of the World Bank Group, said at the meeting of the Americas in Ontario.
For years, scientists have argued human migration will be on the rise as long as temperatures continue to increase. This study represents one piece of a growing body of scientific evidence linking climate change to forced migration and human conflict.
“There are tremendous costs, both for refugees and their hosts, when we are caught flat footed,” Hsiang said. “We should plan and prepare.”"
https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/pentagon-chief-mattis-stresses-diplomacy-as-the-answer-to-ending-korean-crisis,asylum seeker,788,2017-10-27T09:03:43-04:00,"Robert Burns, Associated Press",Pentagon chief Mattis stresses diplomacy as the answer to ending Korean crisis,"PANMUNJOM, Korea — On his first visit to the tense but eerily quiet frontier between North and South Korea as U.S. secretary of defense, Jim Mattis conveyed the message he hopes will win the day: Diplomacy is the answer to ending the nuclear crisis with the North, not war.
He made the point over and over — at the Panmunjom “truce village” where North literally meets South; at a military observation post inside the Demilitarized Zone, and in off-the cuff comments to U.S. and South Korean troops.
“We’re doing everything we can to solve this diplomatically — everything we can,” he told the troops after alighting from a Black Hawk helicopter that had ferried him to and from the border some 25 miles north of central Seoul.
“Ultimately, our diplomats have to be backed up by strong soldiers and sailors, airmen and Marines,” he added, “so they speak from a position of strength, of combined strength, of alliance strength, shoulder to shoulder.”
At Panmunjom, where the armistice ending the Korean war was signed in July 1953, Mattis quoted Secretary of State Rex Tillerson as saying, “Our goal is not war.” The aim, he said, is to compel the North to completely and irreversibly eliminate a nuclear weapons program that has accelerated since President Donald Trump took office.
Despite unanimous condemnation by the U.N. Security Council of the North’s missile launches and nuclear tests, “provocations continue,” Mattis said.
As Mattis arrived at Panmunjom alongside South Korean Defense Minister Song Young-moo, a small group of apparent tourists watched from the balcony of a building on North Korea’s side of the line that marks the inter-Korean border. Uniformed North Korean guards watched silently as Mattis and Song stood just yards away.
Atop Observation Post Ouellette, where he could see deep into North Korea and hear their broadcast taunts of the South, Mattis listened to Song recount some of the history of the 1950-53 Korean war in which thousands of Americans and perhaps more than a million Koreans died in a conflict that remains officially unsettled.
“It reminds us that we fought together in very difficult times, and we stick together today,” Mattis said inside a Demilitarized Zone of craggy terrain, millions of landmines and ghost-like reminders of the war.
The U.S. has about 28,500 troops based in South Korea and has maintained a military presence there since the Korean War ended.
Mattis’s counterpart, Song, gave the former four-star Marine general the lay of the land, noting that the North has 342 long-range artillery pieces aimed at Seoul, among other weapons. That’s a threat that cannot be defended against, Song said, so Washington and Seoul must come up with “new offensive concepts” to be able to eliminate the artillery before it can be used, should war break out.
Mattis called the North “an oppressive regime that shackles its people, denying their freedom, their welfare and their human dignity in pursuit of nuclear weapons and their means of delivery in order to threaten others with catastrophe.”
He noted that earlier this week in the Philippines, he and Song joined Southeast Asian defense ministers in committing to a diplomatic solution to the North Korea problem, even though Pyongyang and its young leader, Kim Jong Un, show no interest in negotiations.
Two other developments Thursday showed the U.S. intention to continue building diplomatic and economic pressure on Pyongyang. The Trump administration imposed sanctions on 10 North Korean officials and organizations over human rights abuses and censorship, including a diplomat in China accused of forcing North Korean asylum seekers home.
Meanwhile, a rare military exercise involving three of the U.S. Navy’s aircraft carrier strike groups was being planned for next month in the Asia Pacific, a U.S. official said. The likely exercise would happen around the time that Trump travels to the region, including to Seoul.
The three Navy carriers and the ships that accompany them are currently thousands of miles apart in the Indian Ocean and the Pacific. But they are moving through the region and could be closer together in weeks.
Trump entered office declaring his commitment to solving the North Korea problem, asserting that he would succeed where his predecessors had failed. His administration has sought to increase pressure on Pyongyang through U.N. Security Council sanctions and other diplomatic efforts, but the North hasn’t budged from its goal of building a full-fledged nuclear arsenal, including missiles capable of striking the U.S. mainland.
On Saturday, Mattis will be joined by Gen. Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, in annual consultations with South Korean defense officials. They are expected to admonish North Korea, vow to strengthen allied defenses, and discuss prospects for eventually giving South Korea wartime control of its own forces."

“We are aware of irregular border crossings by individuals who request refugee protection upon arrival in Canada,” the nation’s Immigration and Citizenship agency said in a Facebook post. “In some countries, messages have been circulating through channels such as WhatsApp which suggest that Canada is inviting individuals to seek refugee status here.
“In fact, the government of Canada discourages people from entering Canada outside of designated ports of entry as it can be dangerous and is a violation of the law.” The post links to the proper procedure to claim refugee protection.

When renewing the status in May, officials said conditions in Haiti were improving so the program might not be extended again.

1. Canada is struggling to deal with asylum seekers fleeing the U.S.
Refugees and some of their Canadians supporters mingle outside Olympic Stadium in Montreal, Quebec, August 5, 2017. Photo by Geoff Robins/AFP/Getty Images
Last week, officials in Montreal had to convert Olympic Stadium into a temporary shelter to house the influx of asylum seekers they’ve intercepted crossing the U.S. border into Canada. As of July, Canada has already admitted 75 percent as many asylum seekers as were admitted in 2016, and the rate of new arrivals recently jumped from about 50 per day to 150 per day, CNN reports. One hundred and fifty cots have been setup in the stadium to help house the new arrivals.
Haitians who were granted asylum in the U.S. after the 2010 earthquake have been unsure of their status since President Trump signaled he’d like to end the program that grants them residence and the right to work in May.
But handling the asylum seekers is a challenge for Canada as well, and the latest influx, who have to avoid crossing the border at official checkpoints to maintain their asylum status, is leading some Canadians to call for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to review polices for refugee admittance, the New York Times reports.
Why it’s important
Immigrant communities are on edge in the U.S. after an uptick of ICE raids, deportations, and increasingly harsh rhetoric about immigration coming from the White House. Meanwhile, ICE has denied that much has changed about how they carry out deportations, despite evidence to the contrary. This uncertainty can have unexpected consequences.
Earlier this year, for instance, the Los Angles police department reported that Latinos have been less likely to report sexual assaults in this new environment, due to their fears of deportation.
Last week, ICE detained two brothers during a regular check-in with authorities and deported them to El Salvador. The men had been motivated to contact ICE to notify the agency of their plans to attend college, one on a scholarship.

Acid attack victim Jameel Muhktar tells his shocking story
“I honestly feel that if this was a white person attacked by an Asian…it’d be all over the news.” Jameel Muhktar and his cousin had acid thrown in their car eight days ago – he told Assed Baig the shocking story of the incident and its aftermath.
Posted by Channel 4 News on Thursday, June 29, 2017
On Friday, UK police arrested four teenagers in London who were thought to be involved in acid attacks, the BBC reported. Authorities said the teens were not detained in connection to a specific incident.
The arrests follow an incident in late June in which a man doused Resham Khan with acid on her 21st birthday. Khan and her cousin, Jameel Mukhtar, 37, were waiting in traffic when a man approached their vehicle and threw the corrosive substance at them.
Authorities are treating the incident as a hate crime.
Mukhtar, who doctors had to place in a medically-induced coma so they could treat his injuries, criticized the response from police.
“I honestly feel that if this was a white person that got attacked by an Asian person, he’d be caught within 24 hours. It would be all over the news, there’s be a national manhunt,” he told Channel 4 News.
No arrests have been made yet.
Khan has been documenting her recovery (with some levity) on Twitter.
“Throughout my treatment, I would question the doctors and police about my attack. How did the attacker get acid? Where is it from? Who does that? Is it a trend? Where did the idea come from? Is this common?” Khan said in a blog post on her website. “And the answers I got were the truth, but not enough.”
Why it’s important
Acid attacks are on the rise in the UK. According to latest figures from the Metropolitan Police, there were 261 acid attacks in 2015 and 454 in 2016, the BBC reported. This year, the number of attacks involving an attacker throwing corrosive liquid onto a victim is expected to surpass those levels.
Police told The Guardian they suspect the spike in attacks is related to organized crime, pointing to a similar mode of transportation — mopeds — to carry out the attacks as one piece of evidence that they are linked to gang activity.
Medical professionals are now offering guidelines on how bystanders can best treat victims in an acid attack, including washing the affected areas with lots of water.
For instance, many think a bottle of water is sufficient to wash away acid, when, in fact, it can take over 10 gallons of water to properly dilute it, Dr. Johann Grundlingh says.
“We’ve seen people who have had highly concentrated acids thrown at them but they washed it off so quickly with a lot of water, that they only really end up with what looks like a bad sunburn,” Grundlingh, a consultant in emergency medicine, told Stat News. “And then you get other people who have had a weaker acid on them, but they didn’t take it that seriously, they didn’t really wash it off effectively, and then they end up with quite severe scarring.”
Meanwhile, Parliament is planning to meet next week with police officials as it weighs tougher laws and sentencing around acid attacks, The Guardian reported.
3. Is the so-called “nuclear renaissance” slowing down in the U.S.?

About a decade ago, South Carolina and Georgia green-lit nuclear power reactors in their states. These new reactors would be among the nation’s first additions to an aging nuclear fleet in three decades.
But early last week, the V.C. Summer nuclear plant in South Carolina announced that it was halting the project, citing ballooning costs. The project’s tab was heading toward $23 billion, analysts said, nearly double its initial estimate of $14 billion.
Days later, the Vogtle Electric Generating Plant in Georgia signaled similar concerns about rising costs that nearly doubled their initial estimates. While the utility company there has promised to press forward, the future looks bleak for what had once been promising nuclear reactors in the U.S.
Why it’s important
In both cases, the utility companies behind these projects cited problems beyond not being economically feasible. There were construction delays, manufacturing problems and, in particular, bankruptcy woes for the contractor connected to the nuclear project in South Carolina.
And other reactors have faced problems, too. The Tennessee Valley Authority’s Watts Bar 2 nuclear power plant first became operational in 2016 and was touted as the nation’s “first new nuclear generation of the 21st century.” But it shut down five months later for a broken condenser. It only became operational again last week.
Rochelle Becker, executive director of the Alliance for Nuclear Responsibility, referred to the reactors as “very expensive dominoes that are falling.”
“With the price of natural gas and the availability of renewable and new sources that are continuing to hit the market, nuclear is pretty much dead in this country,” Becker, a critic of the plants, told The San Diego Union Tribune.
“It doesn’t surprise me at all that these plants are getting canceled,” he added.
Now, with the project in South Carolina out, the Vogtle plant in Georgia could be the only new reactor under construction in the U.S.
On a conference call with analysts, the chief owner of Southern Co. emphasized the company’s resolve to finish the project, The Wall Street Journal reported.
“When you abandon, you have nothing to show for the amount of money you have spent,” Southern chairman Thomas A. Fanning said. “If you go forward, you have a nuclear plant that will serve us for decades to come.”
4. An ancient asteroid family reveals clues about the birth of the solar system
Illustration by NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center Conceptual Image Lab
An international team of scientists tipped a long-standing debate Thursday with the discovery of an asteroid family nearly as old as the solar system.
Their work uncovers how some of the first asteroids formed 4 billion years ago and point to how planets like Earth came to be.
“This family is like a big missing piece of a puzzle that we found,” said Marco Delbo, a planetary scientist at the Observatoire de la Côte d’Azur in Nice, France, and the study’s lead investigator.
Asteroid families form when one asteroid hits another. The asteroid pieces that break off from the collision are a family — they orbit together as a scar of the original impact. Small pieces spread out farther and wider than larger fragments, which remain clustered near the point of impact. Together the pieces form a shape like the letter “V.”
This V formation can expose the age of an asteroid family. The longer it’s been since the initial collision, the more time smaller pieces have had to spread out into the belt.
In 2012, Delbo and his team launched an asteroid belt treasure hunt to learn as much as possible about dark asteroid families in the region of the belt closest to Earth and Mars.
The researchers discovered this ancient asteroid family based on its unique V shape.
“We discovered this family that is more ancient than anything we know,” Delbo said.
Why it’s important

Beyond the edge of the newly-identified family is a void, where only a few orphan asteroids live.
“This is the holy grail of the asteroids,” Delbo said, in part because they are the “original settlers” — they existed in the inner belt before anything else.
These orphan asteroids are large, ranging from 21 to about 93 miles across. Their size suggests the solar system was likely formed by gravitational collapse — a recent hypothesis that posits sizable celestial bodies formed from an accumulation of space dust that gravity suddenly collapsed into large objects. In the past, people thought this space dust had aggregated over a much longer period of time.
Delbo’s study provides evidence for the gravitational collapse hypothesis by suggesting the oldest asteroids started out large, and then became smaller through collisions and other destructive forces happening in the ancient solar system. Planetary scientists have been debating this hypothesis for nearly a decade.
NASA’s OSIRIS-REx mission will visit the region Delbo studied when it stops at the near-Earth asteroid Bennu and collects a sample. Bennu is almost certainly a member of one of these dark asteroid families, Delbo said, and could offer even more clues about the origins of the solar system.
5. Do you know what’s in your eyeliner? The FDA says it has limited resources to inspect beauty products shipped to the U.S.

At least three million cosmetic shipments make their way to the U.S. every year. Unbeknownst to many beauty enthusiasts, some of those cosmetics — including nail polish, face powders, tattoo inks, eyeliners and lipstick — contain high levels of metal or contamination from things like mercury, bacteria and asbestos.
Now, the Food and Drug Administration says it wants more thorough inspections of makeup imports. But it told Congress last week that it has “limited resources” to make them happen, The New York Times reported.
The FDA only has approximately six full-time inspectors to monitor the millions of shipments of product it receives each year, the Times reported. That means fewer than 1 percent of the makeup that comes into the country is examined.
About 15 percent of what those employees were able to inspect was problematic, the FDA says.
Rep. Frank Pallone Jr., D-N.J., a top politician on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, has advocated for more FDA resources. The FDA sent a letter to Pallone on June 30 that detailed exactly what was escaping inspectors. The letter showcases a range of problems, including:
Why it’s important
The letter notes that some countries have notably increased their exports to the United States in the past five years. The FDA highlights China, where exports to the U.S. have increased by 79 percent; Canada and Mexico followed with increases of 60 percent or more. But of the approximately 29,000 foreign companies the FDA says ship cosmetics to the country, few have voluntarily registered, essentially shielding them from inspection for hazardous material.
Trump’s proposed 2018 FDA budget would cut spending for the testing of cosmetics imports, forcing the FDA to reduce the number of shipments inspected from 10,000 a year to about 1,600, The Times reported."

The four-bedroom house in Tucson, Arizona, is stocked with stuffed animals, spare car seats and a small shelf of children’s books. Pantries are meticulously labeled in English and Spanish — latas de comida for canned food and leche en polvo for dry milk. A closet holds all the diapers and towels. Toys are scattered in the backyard.
Artwork drawn and colored by children hang in almost every room of the house, thanking Casa Alitas (Spanish for “wings”) for its charity.

But this isn’t a daycare; there are no children.
Instead, it’s a safe house, set up 2014 by Catholic Community Services to help address the record waves of Central Americans seeking asylum at the U.S.-Mexico border. An array of flags hang above the dining room, representing the many homelands of the families, largely mothers and their children, that are dropped off — many of them from Guatemala and Nicaragua, fleeing violence and poverty in their countries.
The latest family to come through this Tucson safe house left the day before I arrived last month. Co-coordinator Maritza Black, 19, said Casa Alitas has received only five families in the weeks since then. The slowdown is unusual for a safe house that used to host, on average, four families a day.

Black, along with co-coordinator Dora Haydee Lopez, 66, pointed to the Trump administration’s rhetoric and overall conversation around immigration as a direct factor in the noticeable dip they’ve seen in the number of families Immigration and Customs Enforcement drops off at their doorstep.
In January, when Trump signed an executive order to step up deportations, the program coordinator contacted ICE to ask whether policy changes were going to directly affect the agency’s arrangement with Casa Alitas. According to coordinators, the agency said it was not doing anything different in regards to its policy. Later, when coordinators started to see a decline in the number of families sent their way, they checked in again. The agency maintained its position.
ICE didn’t immediately respond to PBS NewsHour’s request for comment on whether it is changing its policy for asylum-seekers.
But numbers appear to be down. According to the latest figures from the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the number of immigrants apprehended at the Southwest border as well as the number of those considered “inadmissibles,” immigrants who present themselves to agents at ports of entry, have been down for the past few months. In March 2017, CPB reported that 16,600 immigrants were apprehended or classified as inadmissible. The agency said this is a 64 percent drop from the same month in the fiscal year 2016.
But it’s hard to say whether the drop in numbers so far in 2017 can be attributed to the strong rhetoric and actions of the Trump administration or to the wait-and-see approach families may be adopting, said Doris Meissner, who heads the U.S. immigration policy program at the Migration Policy Institute in Washington, D.C. Families may be waiting to see whether the communicated plans about stepped up deportations and enforcement actually take place, she said.
During his tour of the U.S.-Mexico border Tuesday in Arizona, Attorney General Jeff Sessions cited a drop in border apprehensions this year, linking the decline to President Donald Trump.
“This is a new era. This is the Trump era,” Sessions said, before outlining new plans to enforce the country’s immigration laws.
But while Sessions spent a large amount of his time on immigration prosecutions, there was no mention of any policy changes on how to address Central American asylum seekers, who are processed differently from Mexican nationals. As described in this Council for Foreign Relations explainer, asylum seekers are granted a hearing before being possibly deported to their home country.

“There’s so much uncertainty, a fear of not knowing,” co-coordinator Dora Haydee Lopez told the NewsHour in March, nodding to the broad but strongly worded immigration plans signaled by the Trump administration.
Last month, Secretary of Homeland Security John Kelly said he doesn’t intend to separate mothers and children at the border, though he eventually walked back that statement.
Casa Alitas, too, is in a wait-and-see position.

Before the house existed, border officials dropped off families at a Greyhound bus depot in the city after they were processed and had a scheduled court date. Black said CSS began to work with Immigration and Customs Enforcement after Greyhound complained to the agency about people being left at the depot overnight.
With families now being redirected to the safe house, volunteers offer immediate assistance. Among their first tasks is to help families arrange phone calls and bus rides to their relatives in the U.S, until their court date. Volunteers also make sure a homecooked meal is waiting for the families when they arrive, along with a shower, clothes and a bed, should they need to rest or stay the night.

There was a time when volunteers were in short supply for the safe house. Two shelters opened up elsewhere in the city to help with overflow at Casa Alitas.
With fewer families being dropped off at Casa Alitas, that’s no longer the case. Volunteers haven’t been as needed; the two shelters are still open, but sometimes on a shorter schedule, depending on demand.
Despite the lack of families seen this year, though, the coordinators said Casa Alitas will remain flexible as a program.
It has also expanded its operation to taking in people with special needs, like a man with a feeding tube, and providing long-term shelter to those with complicated cases.

A woman from Cameroon, who has 3-month-old twins, has been at the house for about four weeks now. She and her husband presented themselves to Border Patrol agents and requested political asylum at the port of entry in Nogales, Arizona. The woman was granted a deportation hearing and dropped off at Casa Alitas with her twins. Her husband, however, was taken to a detention center in Eloy, Arizona, a city approximately halfway between Tucson and Phoenix.
Even if numbers continue to drop, Black said, Casa Alitas’ organizers want the safe house to remain open.
“We believe that no matter how much the numbers are down, there will always be a handful of people entering [the U.S.] on political asylum,” Black said.

Congress has been unable to reach an agreement on comprehensive immigration reform for years, effectively moving some major policy decisions into the executive and judicial branches of government, and fueling debate in the halls of state and municipal governments. Meanwhile, the fates of an estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants in the country, as well as rules for legal immigration, lie in the balance.
The immigration debate moved to the fore once again with the inauguration of Donald J. Trump, who made the issue a centerpiece of his presidential campaign. Shortly after taking office, President Trump signed executive orders on border security, interior enforcement, and refugees, which attempt to follow through on some of his controversial campaign pledges. Some U.S. cities, states, and individuals have challenged the orders in court.
Immigrants comprise about 13 percent of the U.S. population: some 43 million out of a total of about 321 million people, according to Census Bureau data from 2015. Together, immigrants and their U.S.-born children make up about 27 percent of U.S. inhabitants. The figure represents a steady rise from 1970, when there were fewer than 10 million immigrants in the United States. But there are proportionally fewer immigrants today than in 1890, when foreign-born residents comprised 15 percent of the population.
Illegal immigration. The undocumented population is about 11 million and has leveled off since the 2008 economic crisis, which led some to return to their home countries and discouraged others from coming to the United States. In February 2017, Customs and Border Protection reported a 36 percent drop in crossings from the year before, which some attribute to the Trump administration’s policies.
More than half of the undocumented immigrants have lived in the country for more than a decade; nearly one-third are the parents of U.S.-born children, according to the Pew Research Center. Central American asylum seekers, many of whom are minors who have fled violence in their home countries, make up a growing share of those who cross the U.S.-Mexico border. These immigrants have different legal rights from Mexican nationals in the United States: under a 2008 anti–human trafficking law, minors from noncontiguous countries have a right to a deportation hearing before being returned to their home countries.
Though many of the policies that aim to reduce unlawful immigration focus on enforced border security, individuals who arrive to the United States legally and overstay their visas comprise a significant portion of the undocumented population. According to the Center for Migration Studies, individuals who overstayed their visas have outnumbered those who arrived by crossing the border illegally by 600,000 since 2007.
Legal immigration. The United States granted more than 1 million individuals legal permanent residency in 2015, nearly two-thirds of whom were admitted based on family reunification. Other categories included: employment-based preferences (14 percent), refugees (11 percent), diversity (5 percent), and asylees (3 percent). In 2016 there were more than 4 million applicants on the State Department’s waiting list for immigrant visas [PDF].
Hundreds of thousands of individuals work legally in the United States under various types of nonimmigrant visas. In 2016, the United States granted [PDF] more than 180,000 visas to high-skilled workers, known as H-1B visas, and more than 200,000 visas to temporary workers in agriculture and other industries. The issuance of new H-1B visas is capped at 85,000 per year.
Immigrants made up roughly 17 percent of the U.S. workforce in 2014, according to Pew Research Center; of those, around two-thirds were in the country legally. Collectively, immigrants made up 45 percent of domestic employees; they also comprised large portions of the workforce in U.S. manufacturing (36 percent), agriculture (33), and accommodation (32). Another Pew study found that without immigrants, the U.S. workforce is expected to decline from 173.2 million in 2015 to 165.6 million in 2035; the workforce is expected to grow to 183.2 million if immigration levels remain steady, according to the report.
A 2016 Gallup poll found that 72 percent of Americans considered immigration a “good thing” for the United States, and as many as 84 percent supported a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants if they meet certain requirements. A separate Gallup poll found that among Republicans, support for a path to citizenship (76 percent) was higher than support for a proposed border wall (62 percent).
Congress has debated numerous pieces of immigration reform over the last two decades, some considered “comprehensive,” others piecemeal. Comprehensive immigration reform refers to omnibus legislation that attempts to address the following range of issues: demand for high-skilled and low-skilled labor; the legal status of the millions of undocumented immigrants living in the country; border security; and interior enforcement.
The last time legislators came close to significant immigration reform was in 2013, when the Democrat-led Senate passed a comprehensive reform bill that would have provided a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants as well as tough border security provisions. The bill did not receive a vote in the Republican-controlled House of Representatives.
Barack Obama. President Obama took several actions to provide temporary legal relief to many undocumented immigrants. In 2012, his administration began a program, known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), that offers renewable, two-year deportation deferrals and work permits to undocumented immigrants who had arrived to the United States as children and had no criminal records. Obama characterized the move as a “stopgap measure” and urged Congress to pass the Dream Act, legislation first introduced in 2001 that would have benefited many of the same people. As of September 2016, more than 750,000 people had taken advantage of DACA.
In 2014, Obama attempted to extend similar benefits to as many as 5 million undocumented parents of U.S. citizens and permanent residents. However, more than two dozen U.S. states sued the administration, alleging that the program, known as Deferred Action for Parents of Americans (DAPA), violated federal immigration law and the U.S. Constitution. A Texas federal judge blocked the program in 2015, and the Supreme Court effectively killed it in 2016.
Donald J. Trump. Trump made immigration and national security signature issues of his presidential campaign, often staking out controversial positions. During his first few weeks in office, he signed several executive orders attempting to follow through on some of his campaign pledges. The first, which focused on border security, instructed federal agencies to construct a physical wall “to obtain complete operational control” of the U.S. border with Mexico. The second, which focused on interior enforcement, broadened definitions of those unauthorized immigrants prioritized for removal, ordered increases in enforcement personnel and removal facilities, and moved to restrict federal funds from so-called sanctuary jurisdictions, which in some cases limit their cooperation with federal immigration officials. This rule also expands the application of “expedited removal” to anyone who cannot prove they have been in the United States for two years, allowing them to be removed without a court hearing. The third, which focused on terrorism prevention, banned nationals from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen from entering the United States for at least ninety days; blocked nationals from Syria indefinitely; and suspended the U.S. refugee program for 120 days.
The actions, particularly the ban on travelers from seven Muslim-majority countries, drew widespread protests and legal challenges from individuals, cities, and states. In February 2017, a federal judge in Washington State imposed a nationwide restraining order on the so-called travel ban, ruling that the plaintiff states, Washington and Minnesota, had been injured by it and were likely to win their lawsuit challenging its constitutionality. After an appeals court affirmed the ruling, the Trump administration issued a revised order that, among other things, dropped Iraq from the list of affected countries, removed a provision giving preferential treatment to religious minorities (which was seen by critics as a way to exclude Muslims), and excluded those that already had U.S. visas. Additionally, the ban on Syrians was reduced to 120 days. In March, a federal judge in Hawaii imposed a temporary restraining order on this order.
President Trump lowered the annual cap of refugees admitted to the United States from 110,000 to 50,000, and his orders may also make it more difficult for individuals to seek asylum. According to U.S. figures, more than 83,000 people [PDF], many of whom were unaccompanied minors from Central America, filed for asylum in 2015. The new executive orders call for an amended questioning process for those seeking asylum, intended to vet for “fraudulent answers.” Experts say this change could allow immigration officers to be tougher in interpreting standards for asylum. Parents in the United States who pay smugglers to bring their children north could also face legal action, including deportation, under the executive orders.
States vary widely in how they treat unauthorized immigrants (or anyone suspected of being unauthorized). Some states, like California, allow undocumented immigrants to apply for drivers’ licenses, receive in-state tuition at universities, and obtain other benefits. At the other end of the spectrum, other states, like Arizona, have passed laws permitting police to question people about their immigration status.
The federal government is generally responsible for enforcing immigration laws, but it may delegate some immigration-control duties to state and local law enforcement. However, the degree to which local officials are obliged to cooperate with federal authorities is a subject of intense debate. Proponents of tougher immigration enforcement have labeled state and local jurisdictions that limit their cooperation with federal authorities as “sanctuary cities.” There is no official definition or count of sanctuary cities, but the Immigrant Legal Resource Center identifies more than six hundred counties with such policies.
The Obama administration’s enforcement practices drew criticism from the left and the right. Some immigrant advocacy groups criticized his administration for overseeing the removal of more than 3 million people during his eight-year tenure, a figure that outpaced the administrations of former Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush. Many Republicans said the administration was soft on enforcement in narrowing its removal efforts to undocumented immigrants who have committed serious crimes.
President Trump decried sanctuary cities throughout his campaign and has issued executive orders to block federal funding to such municipalities and to reinstate a controversial program, known as Secure Communities, in which state and local police provide fingerprints of suspects to federal immigration authorities, and hand over individuals presumed to be in the country illegally. He also ordered the expansion of enforcement partnerships between federal, state, and local agencies. Several cities have filed lawsuits challenging Trump’s attempt to block federal funding to sanctuary jurisdictions.
Experts say the prospect for comprehensive immigration reform is dim given President Trump’s positions and general political divisions in Washington. “There is no appetite in the Republican party to try to go down the comprehensive [immigration policy reform] road again,” says CFR’s Edward Alden. Some lawmakers may attempt to take a piecemeal approach, starting with enforcement measures, but bipartisan support for “cherry picking” policies is unlikely, he says.
However, one area of immigration policy that could see congressional action is the H-1B program. Democratic and Republican lawmakers have expressed interest in reforming the program, which critics say has been abused by companies to outsource skilled labor and cut costs. In March 2017, the Trump administration announced it would temporarily suspend a program to fast-track H-1B applications.

These immigrants, mainly from Africa and the Middle East, are entering illegally from the U.S., though the exact reason is unknown.
In January and February, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police caught 1,134 people entering Canada illegally, or away from designated checkpoints, amounting to almost half of the number for all of last year, the Associated Press reported. In 2016, the total number was 2,464.
Most of the people entering Canada were in the U.S. legally, judging from their documents, Canadian Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale told reporters, according to Reuters. It’s not clear if the election of President Donald Trump and his policies on immigrants and refugees were motivating factors for them to leave. Some of the immigrants had been planning their move since early 2016, which made it appear unrelated to the election, Goodale said.

But others did express hopes for a better life in Canada. “We didn’t see any future there (in the U.S.), so that’s why we came over,” Pakistani refugee Mohammed Ahmed told NPR.
After President Trump signed his initial executive order suspending the refugee program, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau tweeted that “Canadians will welcome you, regardless of your faith.”

Despite the warm reception from the prime minister, a Reuters/Ipsos poll released March 20 showed that 48 percent of Canadians thought those who crossed over illegally should be deported, while 36 percent said they should be allowed to stay. Concerns over safety were the predominant reason.
Canada, which has a population of 35 million, has set a target of admitting 300,000 immigrants in 2017, including 25,000 refugees. By comparison, the Trump administration has indicated in executive orders that it intends to bring 50,000 refugees into the U.S., a drop from 85,000 during the previous year. And in 2015, about 1.38 million foreign-born people moved to the U.S., according to the Migration Policy Institute.

Back in Canada, when people enter illegally, they are detained and questioned by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. Once they are deemed to not pose a national security risk, they are sent to the Canada Border Services Agency to be screened with other asylum-seekers.
After they are cleared to stay, Canada offers financial, language and logistical assistance. In addition, individuals can privately sponsor refugees for a year after their arrival in Canada.
There’s no simple explanation for the influx of asylum-seekers. Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly told CTV during a recent visit to Ottawa that he has discussed the recent surge in asylum-seekers crossing into Canada with his Canadian counterparts, and they were just as puzzled.
“Those that have been in the business – your ministers – longer than I have are equally as perplexed as to why people who, generally, as a group, have come to the United States legally … enter Canada between points of entry,” he said.

Now what?,"Editor’s Note: The UK formally triggered Article 50 to leave the EU on Wednesday. Learn about what Brexit means for Britain and other countries in this Council on Foreign Relations backgrounder.
Introduction
For decades, the United Kingdom has had an ambivalent and sometimes contentious relationship with the European Union. London has kept its distance from Brussels’ authority by negotiating opt-outs from some of the EU’s central policies, including the common euro currency and the border-free Schengen area. Even still, the EU’s faltering response to recent crises has fueled a renewed euroscepticism. Advocates for a British exit, or Brexit, from the union argued that by reclaiming its national sovereignty, the UK would be better able to manage immigration, free itself from onerous regulations, and spark more dynamic growth.
The victory of the Leave campaign in a June 2016 referendum on the UK’s future in the bloc led to tumult in financial markets and the resignation of Prime Minister David Cameron. Now led by Prime Minister Theresa May, the UK must negotiate a new relationship with the EU. With May triggering the exit process in March 2017 and committing to leaving the EU Single Market, the UK may face the loss of preferential access to its largest trading partner, the disruption of its large financial sector, a protracted period of political uncertainty, and the breakup of the UK itself. Meanwhile, Brexit could accelerate nationalist movements across the continent, from Scotland to Hungary, with unpredictable consequences for the EU.
What is the history of the UK’s membership in the EU?
The UK remained aloof from the continent’s first postwar efforts toward integration, the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) and the the European Economic Community (EEC), formed in the hopes of avoiding another devastating war. “We did not enter the EU with the same political imperatives [as France and Germany],” Robin Niblett, head of the London-based think tank Chatham House, has argued. “We had not been invaded, we did not lose the war, and we have historical connections to all sorts of other parts of the world from our empire and commonwealth.”
The UK didn’t join the EEC until 1973. The British people approved membership in a 1975 referendum, but suspicion of political union with the rest of Europe remained strong. Critics argued that the European project was already moving beyond mere economic integration and toward a European “superstate.”
As integration deepened throughout the 1980s and 1990s, the UK’s leaders pushed for opt-outs. The UK didn’t join the single currency or the border-free Schengen area, and it negotiated a reduced budget contribution. Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher declared in 1988, “We have not successfully rolled back the frontiers of the state in Britain only to see them reimposed at a European level.”
Why did Prime Minister David Cameron try to change the terms of membership?
Many conservatives never reconciled with membership in the EU, and discontent rose in particular over immigration. The issue of migration from within the EU is fraught, as the UK is currently required to accept the free movement of EU citizens.
Economic migration from eastern Europe spiked after the EU expansions of 2004 and 2007, pushing net migration to the UK to more than three hundred thousand people a year by 2015. Conservative Prime Minister Cameron called the situation unsustainable. “It was never envisaged that free movement would trigger quite such vast numbers of people moving across our continent,” he said in 2015. Drawing on this anger, in 2014, the anti-EU UK Independence Party (UKIP) surged, winning the most votes in the UK’s elections to the European Union parliament with an anti-immigration platform.
A wave of asylum seekers arriving from beyond the bloc’s borders has also driven tensions. The UK is exempt from the EU’s 2015 plans to resettle hundreds of thousands of migrants and refugees from the Middle East and Africa, thanks to opt-outs from EU immigration policy. But for eurosceptics, Brussels’s faltering response has highlighted the EU’s dysfunction, and UK policymakers have bristled at suggestions that EU asylum policy might be altered to make it harder to deport migrants to other EU countries. (Under the current system, non-EU asylum seekers are supposed to remain in the first EU country they enter.)
The eurozone crisis also created strains after the EU proposed an unprecedented “fiscal compact” to coordinate budget policy. Cameron rejected the idea in 2012 as harmful to the UK’s financial sector and chafed at the possibility of an additional treaty change.
In a 2013 speech, Cameron attacked flaws in the eurozone and what he called the EU’s excessive bureaucracy and lack of democratic accountability. He also promised to hold a referendum on the UK’s EU membership if his Conservative Party won the 2015 elections, which it subsequently did.
In November 2015, Cameron announced that before holding a referendum, he would seek EU reform in four major areas: national sovereignty, immigration policy, financial and economic regulation, and competitiveness. In February 2016, EU leaders agreed to a number of changes, including protections for non-euro currencies within the EU, new limits on migrants’ benefits, a commitment to reducing EU regulation, and official recognition that the push for “ever closer union” does not apply to the UK.
With these reforms, Cameron hoped to quell the country’s euroscepticism, but the specter of mass migration, combined with several major terrorist attacks in Europe, gave the Leave camp new ammunition. “What he didn’t bargain for was that the migration crisis would get very bad,” says CFR Senior Fellow Sebastian Mallaby. EU leaders have made clear that the subsequent Leave win invalidated the reforms.
What was on the ballot?
In the referendum that took place on June 23, 2016, voters in the UK made a choice on the following question: “Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union or leave the European Union?”
While the Left largely supported remaining in the EU, the Leave camp included a wide swath of antiestablishment ideologies, from disaffected Labourites to the far right UKIP. Meanwhile, the referendum deeply split the UK’s mainstream conservatives. Cameron had staked his political future on the Remain position and announced his resignation in the wake of its defeat, but about half of the Conservative Party, including several of his cabinet ministers, supported Leave. High-profile Conservative defectors included former Mayor of London Boris Johnson, former party leader Iain Duncan Smith, Justice Minister Michael Gove, and Employment Minister Priti Patel.
Despite late polls showing Remain gaining a lead, the British people voted Leave by a margin of 52 to 48 percent, with a robust 72 percent turnout, shocking the UK’s political establishment.
What happens now that the British people have voted Leave?
The UK’s situation is unprecedented; no full member of the EU has ever left. (Greenland, a territory of Denmark, left in 1982.)
Under Article 50 of the 2009 Lisbon Treaty, the UK will have a two-year period to negotiate its withdrawal. However, the UK government must choose when to invoke Article 50, which will make Brexit irrevocable. This has led to debate over when, or even if, the article should be invoked, and whether the UK Parliament could block it. However, Prime Minister May, who won the Conservative Party leadership race to succeed Cameron in July 2016, made clear that “Brexit means Brexit.” She committed to trigger Article 50 on March 29, 2017, though the start of formal talks may be delayed until June.
Once negotiations begin, they will be extremely complex. The UK will need to determine numerous transitional procedures (PDF) for disentangling itself from EU regulations, settling the status of the millions of UK citizens residing in the EU and non-UK EU citizens in the UK, and deciding the future of UK-EU security cooperation. The final withdrawal deal must be approved by a supermajority of EU countries, as well as by a majority in the European Parliament.
Separately but simultaneously, the UK will need to negotiate the terms of its future association with the EU. It’s unclear what such a relationship would look like, but several non-EU countries offer potential models (PDF). Norway, for instance, is a part of the European Economic Area (EEA), which gives it partial access to the Single Market in goods and services. However, it has no say in making EU law even though it has to contribute to the EU budget and abide by EU regulations. Switzerland is not part of the EEA, but it has partial access to the Single Market through a web of bilateral agreements that cover goods but not services, which comprise almost 80 percent of the UK economy. Turkey has only a customs union, meaning a free market of goods but not services as well. However, both Norway and Switzerland must also accept the free movement of people from anywhere in the EU, one of the Leave campaign’s primary complaints.
In a January 2017 speech, May confirmed that the UK will not remain in the Single Market or EU customs union after Brexit. Instead, the government will pursue a new trade agreement with the EU. That decision, combined with France’s assurance that the UK will pay a “price” for leaving, has raised fears of a “hard Brexit,” in which negotiations fail to produce some sort of special arrangement within the two-year window.
What were the arguments for leaving the EU?
Reclaiming sovereignty was at the forefront of the Leave campaign. For Leave supporters, European institutions have changed beyond recognition since 1973, and they accuse the EU of becoming a suffocating bureaucracy with ever-expanding regulations. “Laws which govern citizens in this country are decided by politicians from other nations who we never elected and can’t throw out,” argued Justice Minister Michael Gove.
Immigration was the leading complaint. The number of EU migrants in the UK nearly tripled (PDF) between 2004 and 2015, from about one million to over three million, almost totally due to an influx of citizens from newer members including Poland, Bulgaria, and Romania.
At the same time, terror attacks in Paris and Brussels involving EU citizens raised fears that the free movement of people leaves the UK vulnerable. With over three thousand EU nationals having traveled to Syria to fight with the self-proclaimed Islamic State, the former head of UK intelligence, Richard Dearlove, argued that controlling immigration would be the primary security benefit of a Brexit. (On the contrary, critics said Brexit would hurt intelligence cooperation.)
The immigration issue powerfully combines anxieties over identity, economic security, and terrorism, says Matthew Goodwin, an expert on UK politics at the University of Kent. “The referendum is as much about immigration as it is about Britain’s relationship with Europe,” he says.
For some analysts, European institutions are ill-equipped to address the economic challenges of the modern world. Economist Roger Bootle, author of The Trouble With Europe, argues that the EU’s focus on “harmonization”—the continent-wide standardization of everything from labor regulations to the size of olive oil containers—threatens Europe with persistent low growth and high unemployment.
Leaving will spark economic dynamism, according to Dominic Cummings, director of the Vote Leave campaign. The EU is “extraordinarily opaque, extraordinarily slow, extraordinarily bureaucratic,” he says. Leave supporters believes that without that burden, the UK can reduce regulation, improve competitiveness, and forge trade deals with fast-growing emerging economies. To Cummings, the reforms Cameron negotiated were trivial, leaving the UK no choice but to eject from a dysfunctional union.
How has the UK benefited from membership, and what are the risks of leaving?
The UK is highly integrated with the rest of the EU in terms of trade, investment, migration, and financial services (see graphic). The Remain side cautioned against risking that relationship: Cameron warned about a “leap into the dark,” while Finance Minister George Osborne foresaw a “convulsive shock.”
In the days after the Brexit vote, global markets shook. The British pound fell sharply, reaching a low not seen in more than a century. In response, the UK central bank unveiled a large package of stimulus measures, including its first cut in interest rates in more than seven years. At the same time, driven by stronger-than-expected growth in manufacturing, partly due to a weaker currency, the UK became the world’s fastest-growing developed economy, though International Monetary Fund economists warn that the boost is only temporary.
The long-term outlook is still uncertain. For Adam Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics and former voting member of the Bank of England, the pro-Brexit camp’s economic arguments were a “fantasy.” He argues that immigration from the EU has driven growth and that belonging to the EU has allowed the UK to “punch above its weight” in trade, since the larger bloc can negotiate more favorable market-access deals with outside countries.
Other U.S. observers have warned that a Brexit would damage the UK’s special relationship with the United States. On an April 2016 state visit, President Barack Obama argued that membership in the EU enhances the UK’s global influence and aids U.S. interests. But the administration of President Donald J. Trump is likely to take a different tack. Trump has praised the Brexit vote and promised a rapid start to new trade talks between the UK and the United States.
Much will depend on the UK’s post-Brexit relationship with the EU. Losing barrier-free access to the Single Market, with its more than five hundred million consumers and over $18 trillion worth of GDP, places more pressure on UK policymakers to strike a trade deal with the EU. Without it, UK exports would be subject to the union’s external tariff starting in 2019. Trade would suffer and some foreign investors would likely pull out of major industries, such as the thriving automotive sector. The UK would also be shut out of any EU-U.S. free-trade deal (known as TTIP) and would need to renegotiate trade access with the fifty-three countries with which the EU currently has trade agreements.
Particularly hard hit, argues founder of the pro-Remain website InFacts, Hugo Dixon, will be financial services. They currently enjoy “passporting,” meaning UK-based financial institutions can operate freely anywhere in the EU. If that is lost, many firms are likely to move their offices—and jobs—out of the UK to elsewhere in Europe.
How could the Leave vote affect the rest of Europe?
The most immediate consequence could be the breakup of the UK itself. Scotland, which held an unsuccessful independence referendum in 2014, voted to remain in the EU. In March 2017, Scotland’s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, proposed a new referendum, arguing that the largely pro-Remain citizens of Scotland deserve a choice over whether to remain in the EU by leaving the UK. However, Prime Minister May rejected such a vote, which must be approved by London.
Ireland, too, will face a dilemma; it is strongly committed to the EU but nonetheless economically intertwined with the UK. Ireland’s government has also warned that a Brexit could upend Northern Ireland’s peace settlement and complicate border between Ireland and Northern Ireland.
Elsewhere, Brexit may embolden eurosceptics by providing a “template” for leaving, says CFR’s Mallaby. “The younger generation of Italians, Portuguese, and Greeks associate membership of the eurozone, and, by extension, the European Union, with a terrible depression,” he says. That has translated into electoral gains for anti-EU parties, such as France’s National Front, Germany’s Alternative für Deutschland, and Hungary’s Jobbik. Polling has found that a majority of French citizens want their own EU referendum.
The ultimate fear around the continent is that Brexit could unravel the rest of the EU, especially if the UK economy performs well in its aftermath. Even barring that, Brexit will be a heavy blow to a union that has struggled to maintain a united front maintaining sanctions on Russia and managing the unprecedented wave of migrants. And, in the wake of 2015 terrorist attacks in Paris, when France invoked the EU’s mutual defense clause for the first time, Brexit threatens to end Europe’s hopes for a truly common security and defense policy once and for all.

BERLIN — German Chancellor Angela Merkel heads to Washington on Monday ahead of her first meeting with President Donald Trump. The encounter between the trained physicist and veteran politician, renowned for her measured comments and reserved style, and the billionaire real-estate outsider whose off-the-cuff tweets and undiplomatic approach have rocked American politics could produce an interesting dynamic.
But despite the difference in styles, hopes are high that Europe’s most powerful leader will be able to use her savvy and experience to dispel some of the angst that has grown internationally over the first weeks of Trump’s administration.
Though she’s talked by phone with Trump, Tuesday’s meeting in person with the new president will present her with a good opportunity to get a read of “who is calling the shots” and “who has the president’s ear,” said Sylke Tempel, an expert with the German Council on Foreign Relations.
READ MORE: Trump and Merkel to discuss NATO, terrorism in next week’s meeting
“You can only find that out when you’re there, and this is a situation where she’s particularly good because she observes things,” Tempel said.
In Merkel’s 12 years as chancellor she worked well with both Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama, and she’s also demonstrated that she won’t be pushed around by leaders who try to use what Tempel called “macho” tactics with her.
“Putin tried that on her, Erdogan tried that and there are quite a few others,” Tempel said. “She has an enormous amount of patience, an internal calm and self-confidence, and the kind of personality that would say ‘I’ve seen macho characters come and go, and I’ve seen men making a lot of mistakes.'”
In addition to establishing a relationship with Trump and getting a firsthand read of the new White House dynamics, there are a wide range of issues that Merkel is expected to address.
With Trump’s “America first” economic leanings, his questioning of multilateral trade deals and enthusiastic endorsement of Britain’s decision to leave the European Union, Merkel’s main goal is expected to be to impress upon the president her view that a strong EU is also in Washington’s strategic and economic interests.
Alluding to this, she told Parliament on Thursday that she plans to emphasize that “even if in parts of the world we see protectionist and nationalist approaches on the rise, Europe may never isolate, seal itself off or withdraw.”
She’s bringing with her a trade delegation that reportedly includes the heads of both BMW and Siemens, whose companies together employ around 120,000 people in the U.S. in their factories and related businesses.

Trade between the U.S. and Europe is “advantageous for both sides,” Merkel said after meeting German business leaders in Munich on Monday.
“Talking directly is always much better than talking about each other,” she said. “That will be my motto on this visit, which I am looking forward to.”
Trump has vocalized several other differences with Merkel, notably on the campaign trail last year when he called her decision in 2015 to allow 890,000 asylum seekers into Germany a “disaster” and said that “Hillary Clinton wants to be America’s Angela Merkel.”
Trump has also openly suggested that NATO is obsolete and has urged European countries to live up to commitments to spend at least 2 percent of gross domestic product on defense, though U.S. Vice President Mike Pence reassured Europeans in Munich last month that America’s commitment to the alliance was “unwavering.” Trump has elicited European concerns on multiple other issues, too, including his more friendly approach to Russia and his position on climate change.
In pointed remarks about Germany specifically, White House trade adviser Peter Navarro last month said that the country was using a “grossly undervalued” euro to “exploit” the U.S. and EU, and last week singled out the U.S. deficit with Germany as “one of the most difficult” trade issues Washington faces.
Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble scoffed at the idea Germany was somehow using currency manipulation to bolster exports, telling a group of foreign reporters in Berlin last week that the trade surplus was due to “the competitiveness of German industry” — in other words, Germany makes products Americans want to buy.
Despite the differences, Merkel told Parliament she would emphasize how much the U.S. and Europe have in common.
“I am deeply convinced that the trans-Atlantic partnership based on common values is in all of our interests, not only for us Europeans,” she said.
“I’ll hold my talks with President Donald Trump in this spirit. Precisely because the nature of the trans-Atlantic relationship has changed, Europe has decided to take more responsibility in the future, both in our own neighborhood and beyond.”"
https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/fallout-grows-trumps-new-immigration-crackdown,asylum seeker,768,2017-01-28T16:11:54-05:00,"Alicia A. Caldwell, Associated Press",Fallout grows from Trump’s new immigration crackdown,"WASHINGTON — The fallout grew Saturday from President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown as U.S. legal permanent residents and visa-holders from seven Muslim-majority countries who had left the United States found they could not return for 90 days.
It was a period of limbo for an unknown number of non-American citizens from Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia or Yemen now barred from the country where they were studying or had lived, perhaps for years.
A federal law enforcement official who confirmed the temporary ban said there was an exemption for foreigners whose entry is in the U.S. national interest. It was not immediately clear how that exemption might be applied.
Trump’s order exempts diplomats.
Those already in the U.S. with a visa or green card will be allowed to stay, according to the official, who wasn’t authorized to publicly discuss the details of how Trump’s order was being put in place and spoke only on condition of anonymity.
Customs and Border Protection was notifying airlines about passengers whose visas had been canceled or legal residents scheduled to fly back to the U.S. Airlines were being told to keep them off those flights.
Trump’s order barred all refugees from entering the U.S. for four months, and indefinitely halted any from Syria. He said the ban was needed to keep out “radical Islamic terrorists.”
The next group of refugees was due to arrive in the U.S. on Monday, but the official said they would not be allowed into the country.

The president’s order immediately suspended for four months a program that last year resettled in the U.S. roughly 85,000 people displaced by war, political oppression, hunger and religious prejudice. An immediately 90-day ban was put in place for all immigration to the U.S. from the seven Muslim majority nations.
Trump’s order singled out Syrians for the most aggressive ban, ordering that anyone from that country, including those fleeing civil war, are indefinitely blocked from coming to the U.S.
“We want to ensure that we are not admitting into our country the very threats our soldiers are fighting overseas,” Trump said as he signed the order at the Pentagon. “We only want to admit those into our country who will support our country and love deeply our people.”
Trump’s ban on asylum-seekers came down even as Iraqis endangered by work for the United States in their home country were midflight to their hoped-for refuge in the United States. As a result, they and countless other refugees, their families and aid workers scrambled Saturday as Muslim travelers were turned back on arrival at U.S. airports or blocked from boarding flights to America.
Organizations including the International Refugees Assistance Project, which helps former Iraqi translators for the U.S. military and other refugees seeking entry to the United States, and other organizations aiding asylum-seekers, rushed translators and lawyers to airports to try to help U.S.-approved asylum-seekers already on their way to the country as Trump’s ban came down.
Trump said the halt in the refugee program was necessary to give agencies time to develop a stricter screening system. While the order did not spell out what additional steps he wants the departments of Homeland Security and State to take, the president directed officials to review the refugee application and approval process and find any more measures that could prevent those who pose a threat from using the refugee program.
The U.S. may admit refugees on a case-by-case basis during the freeze, and the government will continue to process requests from people claiming religious persecution, “provided that the religion of the individual is a minority religion in the individual’s country.”
In an interview with CBN News, Trump said persecuted Christians would be given priority in applying for refugee status.
As a candidate, Trump called for a temporary ban on all Muslim immigration to the U.S. He later shifted his focus to putting in place “extreme vetting” procedures to screen people coming to the U.S. from countries with terrorism ties.
The Council on American-Islamic Relations said it would challenge the constitutionality of the executive order.
During the past budget year, the U.S. accepted 84,995 refugees, including 12,587 people from Syria. President Barack Obama had set the refugee limit for this budget year at 110,000.
According to Trump’s executive order, he plans to cut that to 50,000. Refugee processing was suspended in the immediate aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks and restarted months later.

Asked at a news conference Saturday about protectionist tendencies in the U.S., Merkel said she will seek a dialogue with the new president.
“I don’t want to get ahead of that, but I am very much convinced that we as partners benefit more if we act together than if everyone solves problems for themselves, and that is a constant fundamental attitude on my part,” she said.
Underlining the importance of the Group of 20 industrial powers, which Germany chairs this year, she said that the international response to the financial crisis “was not a response based on isolation, but a response based on cooperation, on common rules for regulating financial markets, and I think that is the promising path.”
Merkel has made clear that she’s unhappy about the possible demise of the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement as a result of Trump’s desire to withdraw the United States. Trump has criticized Merkel’s decision to allow large numbers of migrants into Germany.

Merkel said there are contacts “at adviser level” with Trump’s team, though there was no immediate word on any plans for a meeting beyond the summits of the Group of Seven and G-20 in May and July respectively. Merkel will host the latter summit in the German city of Hamburg.
“We’ll wait for the inauguration and then we will talk about this,” she said at a news conference. Trump will be inaugurated on Friday.
Merkel is seeking a fourth term in an election expected in September. Leaders of her conservative Christian Democratic Union met Friday and Saturday in Perl, in western Saarland state, to kick off the election year — which also features three state elections, the first in Saarland in March.
Merkel has said she expects her most difficult election yet, though she was confident Saturday that a simmering dispute with her allies in Bavaria, the Christian Social Union, won’t get in the way of a joint conservative campaign.
The CSU has demanded for the past year an annual cap of 200,000 on the number of refugees Germany accepts, an idea Merkel rejects. Germany saw 890,000 asylum-seekers arrive in 2015 and 280,000 last year.
Merkel said leaders of her party agreed “that we can live with such a disagreement.”
She renewed her pledge of improved security following last month’s deadly attack on a Berlin Christmas market. “We are making clear that every person has a right to security, and only those who are secure can live in freedom,” she said.
Germany’s 16 states must have the same security standards, Merkel said, arguing that it’s not sensible for regions to have different rules on matters such as video surveillance."
https://www.pbs.org/newshour/economy/column-italys-referendum-means-european-union,asylum seeker,1129,2016-12-01T08:12:12-05:00,Vikram Mansharamani,Column: What Italy’s referendum means for the European Union,"This weekend, Italians will vote on constitutional changes proposed by Prime Minister Matteo Renzi. And although the vote is technically about reforms the 41-year-old former Mayor of Florence wants to implement, Italians no longer see it that way. It’s now a vote about the nation, its leadership and possibly even its future relationship with Europe. Anti-establishment populists have rallied the citizenry against Renzi and the governing elites. This Sunday’s vote, The Economist notes, is effectively a “Renzi-ferendum.”
The irony is that Renzi rose to power on a promise to radically reform the Italian government. But even before he was elected Prime Minister in 2014, he was known as “Il Rottamatore,” meaning “The Demolition Man,” of Italian politics. He earned the nickname by incessantly lampooning the government and pledging to upend the country’s political establishment. Today, he’s deemed part of the establishment.
Believing institutional paralysis to be one of Italy’s biggest problems, Renzi is trying to improve the country’s governability by assuring greater political stability and streamlining the legislative process. Specifically, Renzi’s plan would reduce the size and authority of the Senate, clarify responsibilities in areas where regional and central government jurisdictions overlap and remove a layer of local government.
In part because of the Senate’s existing powers, the country has had 63 governments in the last 70 years (and no, that’s not a typo). But, as The Economist notes, “the mayfly-like lifespans of Italian governments is not the sole reason” that it is difficult to govern Italy. Legislative gridlock is another.
Because of equal powers given to both houses in the parliament, legislation can bounce between the two bodies until it is approved in identical form. It’s not unusual for bills to be debated for years. For example, a bill that makes torture an offense has been discussed in the Italian parliament for 27 years, most recently in July.
Given these dynamics, you might imagine support for the reforms would be strong. You’d be mistaken.
Renzi’s announcement that he would resign if the referendum failed changed the dynamics around the upcoming vote. It went from being about the reforms to being about him. One poll cited by The Guardian found “only 40% of Italians say they will vote on the reform package; 56% consider their vote to be more a verdict on the prime minister, his government and, by implication, the state of the nation.”

Further, Mario Margiocco asserts “to vote ‘no’ is to vote against the system and all its corruption…and who isn’t against corruption?” Even The Economist, citing risks to the emergence of a unaccountable strongman, advised, “No is how Italians should vote.” The last poll published before the vote indicated 55 percent opposition to the reforms.
The economy isn’t helping Renzi’s cause. The country’s GDP is smaller than it was before the financial crisis. But because of population growth, GDP per capita is today roughly where it was in the late 1990s. Employment levels in Italy are the second lowest in Europe, slightly better than Greece, and the country’s debt-to-GDP ratio is above 130 percent. And the banking industry, Europe’s fourth largest, is teetering under $400 billion of problem loans, equivalent to more than 20 percent of the country’s GDP. At one point earlier this year, Monte dei Paschi di Siena, the world’s oldest bank, had problem loans of more than 50 times its market capitalization. The overhang of bad loans is starving Italian entrepreneurs and small business owners of capital they need to grow.
There’s also the migrant crisis. According to the UN refugee agency and the Italian government, more than 170,000 asylum seekers have reached Italy by boat so far this year, exceeding the standing record set in 2014. One reason for the recent surge, notes The Guardian, is that greater Turkish policing and aggressive deportation threats by Greek officials have resulted in “the Italian route once again becoming the main migrant gateway into Europe.”
Unsurprisingly, the combination of economic malaise and record migrant inflows is bolstering populists. Two groups in particular stand to win if Renzi loses: the populist Five Star Movement and the anti-immigrant Northern League. Both are anti-establishment organizations that question the value Italy receives from being part of the European Monetary Union or from using the euro as its currency. As a result of this setup, the stakes of the December 4th vote are enormous. A Renzi defeat may affect Italy’s future relationship with Brussels.
Could this weekend’s vote lead to Italy’s exit from the European Union and a reversion to the lira? The logic is straightforward: Renzi loses, anti-establishment parties come to power, Italy exits. A believable story, for sure. Because of these dynamics, my friend John Mauldin has said “a ‘no’ vote would be the death knell for the euro.” And if you believe, as I do, that Europeans will ultimately choose individual countries with their own currencies instead of opting to join the United States of Europe, then a Renzi loss might help speed along an already unfolding process.
But on the other hand, it’s also possible that a ‘no’ vote doesn’t directly affect the euro’s short-term viability. A poll published earlier this month found that only 15.2 percent of Italians were in favor of leaving the single currency, “with 67.4% declaring themselves true single currency believers.” Although our recent experience with polls in the United States and the United Kingdom may lead us to skeptically interpret their conclusions, our prior faith in polls was based on their historical accuracy. It would be foolish to dismiss the data entirely.
If the referendum fails to pass and Renzi resigns, one thing is certain — market volatility and political uncertainty will increase. One report suggests that investor confidence would plunge, and up to eight Italian banks might fail if the reforms are rejected. The fear might spread to Europe more generally, leading to a materially weaker euro as capital flees the continent. If this happens, the U.S. dollar would likely strengthen. And Italy might call for an early election next year, creating a situation in which, as noted by Bloomberg, “governments accounting for more than 75% of the euro area GDP would be in play in just one year.”
A Renzi victory, on the other hand, might turn the anti-globalization tide and help Italy attract much needed capital for its banks and economy. It might even deter citizens of France, Austria and other countries from voting in populist leaders. As for the currency impact, that is less clear.
In either case, the hard work of reforming the Italian system (and fixing Europe) still lies ahead."

BEKAA VALLEY, Lebanon — They are two faces of what many here fear is a “lost generation” of Syrian refugees.
The tender, smooth face of Batoul, 14, was revealed when she adjusted a traditional headscarf, showing no physical wounds of the brutal war that began in her native Syria five years ago this month.
But as she wiped away a tear and explained the decision her parents made to offer her hand as a child bride at the age of 13, the wounds pushed to the surface: “I feel trapped now. I feel like I am in prison.”
Mohammed, 13, whose family also fled the war in neighboring Syria, tried his best to steel his face with confidence as he spoke of his days working in a metal shop, missing several years of schooling yet holding on to his dream to become a scientist. Still, the sorrow came through every word of a popular poem about the war, which he recited from memory:
“Syria, five years and more of a crazy and selfish and illogical war.
Five years in which souls, hearts and minds have been destroyed…”
These are two faces among more than 4.8 million refugees — about half of whom are children — who fled the war in Syria to neighboring countries and to Europe, spurring a refugee crisis which the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees has called the worst since World War II.
The conflict began on March 15, 2011 in the cities of Damascus and Aleppo, when President Bashar al-Assad ordered armed troops to move in on what had been largely nonviolent protests.
In the five years since, Assad’s regime has steadily stepped up attacks with tanks and airstrikes against an armed opposition and the civilian population. An amalgam of armed groups fractured into militias and then splintered further into Islamic extremist insurgents including the self-proclaimed Islamic State group.
An estimated 300,000 people have been killed and hundreds of thousands more wounded. In addition to the 4.8 million refugees, there are some 6 million internally displaced people in Syria, according to the United Nations.
A tenuous “cessation of hostilities” was put in place last month, and peace talks are getting underway again in Geneva this month. But few international observers believe the end of the war is in sight. The neighboring countries of Lebanon, Jordan and Turkey are now restricting the wave of refugees trying to cross over from Syria.
And the European Union, which accepted a wave of asylum-seekers over the summer, is now grappling with a realization that the refugee crisis is untenable, and countries there are securing their borders as well.
Meanwhile, in the muddy warrens of the informal tented settlements, where refugees are scratching out an existence in Lebanon, the U.N. food subsidy of $184 per month per family is often not enough. Life is getting harder and harder, particularly for the children.

Girls like Batoul are being married off as child brides because their parents can’t afford to keep them or because their families fear sexual assault and harassment, which advocates and aid workers say is rampant in the chaos of the camps. Children of both sexes, they add, also are exploited physically and sexually.
Because men are not permitted to work in the host countries like Lebanon, where official work permits are hard — if not impossible — to come by, children are often forced to work in agriculture or factories or peddle on the streets. Aid workers call it a “lost generation” of Syrian children who have fallen far behind in schooling and who suffer greatly from collective trauma.
“That is ultimately the saddest,” said Maeve Murphy, head of UNICEF in Lebanon’s Bekaa Valley, where many of these refugees have settled to wait out the war. “You see young people whose dreams will never materialize unless they have some stability and unless they are able to access education.”
Batoul sat beside her mother and father, who could not hold back tears as they described escaping the fighting that surrounded their home in Homs, Syria’s third largest city and a key battleground in the uprising against the regime. They recounted the troubles they’ve faced as refugees in Lebanon. Her father, Mohammad, 41, was a mason who made a decent living in Syria pouring foundations for new homes and buildings before the family fled Homs in 2012.
Now, they live in a corrugated tin hut with UNHCR canvas for a roof. Over the last four years, Batoul’s father said all of their savings disappeared. The economic desperation that set in, along with the parents’ deep concerns for their daughter’s protection, forced Mohammad to allow his beloved daughter to be taken as a child bride by her cousin. Both he and Batoul’s mother now regret that decision.
“If God would allow us to undo what we have done, we would do it,” said Batoul’s mother, Amina, 33, through tears which she dabbed with a traditional headscarf. “We put a burden on her that she can’t handle. It was a terrible mistake. We have stolen her childhood.”

Aid workers and advocates say child marriages are happening at an alarming rate for Syrian girls as young as 12 years old. But because these marriages fall under Islamic religious laws, which by some Quranic interpretations permit brides as young as 9, the government in Lebanon looks the other way.
At the same time, women’s rights organizations have railed against the practice as a human rights violation and as a health risk. The second highest cause of death for girls 15 to 19 is complications during childbirth, according to the World Health Organization.
Amina is despondent over her daughter’s fate, and is worried about her psychological and physical wellbeing. Recently, Amina has begun working with an advocacy center for women and girls that tries to help refugee families avoid the mistake she made. She’s tried to instill this spirit of advocacy for the rights of women in Batoul, as well, who says she wants to be a lawyer.
“I want to help other women and be sure they know their rights,” said Batoul.
Patricia Mouamar, communications director for World Vision in Lebanon, explained that in her experience the number of child brides is on the rise: “There are no official statistics when it comes to early marriage. But I have been seeing refugees for the last five years. And every time I come I meet a family that has to make this difficult decision.”
Amina said she feels she has lost her daughter, adding, “I don’t think about the future, I don’t think about hope.”
But Batoul tried to comfort her mother on a visit home on a recent afternoon, saying, “I do have a lot of hope, hope in returning to Syria. There will be better days than these days. Even if there are problems, they will be better than the problems here.”

That sense of resiliency was not uncommon among many of the young people we interviewed in the ramshackle communities of tents that dot the landscape in the flat, fertile land of the Bekaa Valley. Syrian children seemed to be everywhere here, working in tire repair shops and gas stations and sweeping the floors at local produce markets.
“Child labor is a phenomenon that has been increasing. These children should not be on the streets, they should be playing and they should be going to school. Sadly, it is not happening because they have to survive. When it comes to basic instincts for survival, you have to do what you have to do to survive and help your family,” said Mouamar.
At one World Vision youth center, part of a program known as a Child Friendly Space which offers a protective community and remedial schooling, the 13-year-old Mohammed stood out from a crowd of young boys. He puts long hours in at the metal shop, and talked about memories of his home in Syria: “I remember my friends and I miss my school. Syria is so beautiful. More beautiful than here.”
Mohammed carried himself with great confidence, as he recited the poem titled “To Our Country.” The poem, he explained, was written by Syrian sisters Rihan and Faia Younan and became a viral sensation on YouTube.
Many Syrian children have committed it to memory, as he has:
“A war that sneaked through doors to settle down inside the home and humiliate their owners.
A war in which children and women were sold in slave markets.
A war that brought the nation’s mothers to tears, and exhausted its men.
A war that never knew its beginning.
A war that dreams of an end.”

Under the usual Swedish immigration policy, all those granted asylum are given permanent residency. With the new measures, however, temporary residence permits will only be given to the minimum number of refugees Sweden is obliged to help under EU and UN conventions. In addition, the country will enforce strict ID checks on all public transportation in and out of Sweden.
These new policies are in response to the fact that Sweden feels it has been taking a disproportionate amount of responsibility in the migrant crisis facing Europe. Currently, Sweden has the largest proportion of Syrian refugees per population in Europe.
The nordic country has been a top choice for migrants due to its generous asylum policy, well-developed welfare state, and high standard of living – all distinctions that Sweden prides itself on. However, in October, the Swedish Migration Agency declared that it expects to take in up to 190,000 asylum seekers in 2015 – double the number originally predicted in July.
The announcement is an effort to compel other EU countries to take action in the growing refugee crisis.
Back in August, Germany responded to the escalating crisis by temporarily suspending the Dublin Regulations, the EU immigration policy which states that immigrants must register for asylum with the first EU country they enter. However, in early November, Germany stated that it is “returning to orderly procedures” and installed a temporary border control on its border with Austria in response to the overwhelming number of Syrian refugees.
The Dublin Regulation is largely not being followed in the current refugee crisis because a majority of migrants are entering through Greece, which does not have the capacity to handle them. The Swedish Prime Minister highlighted the urgent need for the 28-member bloc to create a permanent system that takes the burden off of border countries such as Greece and Macedonia and the “popular” countries such as Sweden and Germany to evenly share the burden of refugees and asylum seekers.
“The situation is untenable,” Prime Minister Lofven told reporters. “It is clear that migration politics in the EU need to be completely reviewed.”"

Starting Sept. 15, Orban said Hungary will impose tougher laws for immigrants. He told reporters that immigrants have rebelliously seized train stations and failed to cooperate in their registration process.
Hungary has been hit hard with refugees trying to make their way to wealthier European Union countries with more liberal immigration laws like Germany, Austria and Sweden.
So far this year, over 150,000 migrants and refugees from Syria and other parts of the Middle East have made their way into Hungary.
Hungary, now overwhelmed, announced yesterday that it would begin using its army to guard the southern border. Soldiers are working to complete the fence on the Serbian border.
The crisis has drawn attention to the plight and treatment of refugees and migrants who are being held in camps without any word of what will happen next. The Human Rights Watch put out a statement today saying the camps are abysmal, filthy and overcrowded.
Earlier this week, the European Commission presented a plan to distribute refugees and migrants across Europe and add an additional 120,000 asylum seekers to the quota. Finland has agreed to take in 2,400."

Where the candidate stands on 10 issues,"He’s the son of Cuban immigrants. A law school student who got his political start as a congressional intern and rose to become Florida’s youngest-ever state House speaker. And his favorite hip hop songs come from N.W.A, Eminem and Tupac Shakur. But where does Marco Rubio stand on the issues? Here is a look at 10.
The budget: Balance it. Prioritize defense.
Rubio supports balancing the federal budget within 10 years and has long advocated freezing spending for everything but defense at 2008 levels. This year, the Florida senator proposed raising defense spending. He voted for the Senate Republican plan, which balances the budget and cuts $4.3 trillion in spending, including funds from Medicare and other programs.

Climate change: It is real. It is not caused by man.
In January, Rubio supported a Senate measure stating that “climate change is real and not a hoax.” On a separate vote, he opposed a measure stating that human activity contributes to changing temperatures. That reflects a consistent stance from Rubio that mankind is not having the effect on the climate that scientists portray.

Obamacare: Repeal it. Replace it with tax credits and fewer regulations.
Rubio has attacked the Affordable Care Act and wants to repeal it. His replacement proposal, outlined in a Fox News op-ed, calls for new tax credits to help people purchase insurance, revising health insurance regulations and reforming Medicare and Medicaid.
READ MORE: What does Donald Trump believe?
The Internet: Oppose net neutrality.
Last month, Rubio outlined strong opposition to “net neutrality”, or the new government policy that Internet providers should not charge different prices for different types of content. Rubio argues this gives the government too much power over winners and losers on the Internet. He is opposed to implementing further taxes on the Internet.
Immigration: Secure the border, then work towards a legal status and possible path to citizenship. More vetting for refugees.
Rubio supports a legal status for undocumented immigrants, but only after the U.S. border is secure. To accomplish that, Rubio said he would hire 20,000 new border agents and would complete the 700-mile fence at the border. The Florida Senator said he would not deport all of the undocumented immigrants in the country now.
READ MORE: What does Bernie Sanders believe?
In 2013, Rubio joined the “Gang of Eight,” which drafted and pushed a comprehensive immigration reform bill, including a path to citizenship, through the Senate. After the bill froze in the House, Rubio refocused his efforts on securing the border with Mexico.
Rubio wants a more stringent vetting process for incoming refugees, one that would block many asylum seekers from resettling in the U.S. (He supported a bill to that effect in January, 2016.) He also believes in “commonsense” vetting standards that would allow very young and very old refugees into the country with fewer background check requirements than other refugees.
Social issues: The Supreme Court decision on gay marriage is the law of the land. Ban abortion after 20 weeks. Marriage is between a man and a woman.
Rubio disagreed with the Supreme Court decision legalizing same-sex unions in all fifty states but said that Americans must abide by the ruling. Personally, the Florida senator told CNN that he believes marriage is between a man and a woman. Holding a nuanced position on Indiana’s Religious Freedom Restoration Act, Rubio believes some kinds of businesses, like wedding photography, should be allowed to turn away gay customers, and others, like hotels, should not.
On abortion, Rubio co-sponsored a 2013 Senate bill to ban abortion after 20 weeks since fertilization, making exceptions for the life of the mother, rape or incest.

Taxes: Cut corporate taxes to 25 percent. Reform the tax code. Cap economic regulations.
Rubio proposes to simplify the tax code, outlining his tax reform plan in an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal.
Rates for corporations would fall to 25 percent, and they would still be able to deduct the full cost of their capital expenses. Individuals would be subject to just two rates: 15 percent for those earning under $75,000, and 35 percent for those earning above that. Capital gains taxes would be erased and families would be eligible for a new $2,500-per-child tax credit.
Rubio also proposes budget reforms that would leave the government and federal agencies unable to institute new economic regulations without repealing an equal amount of existing ones, essentially putting a halt to regulatory growth. He opposes replacing the sales tax with a Value-Added Tax.
Cuba: Block the Obama administration’s “normalization”
Rubio has vowed to block President Obama’s effort to work with the Castro-led government of Cuba and establish more normalized ties with its leadership. He argues the policy shift comes “at the Cuban people’s expense.”
In March, Rubio sent a letter to Secretary of State John Kerry, urging the administration to keep Cuba on its list of state sponsors of terror.
Iran: Toughen sanctions. Scrap proposed nuclear deal.
A hawk on Iran, Rubio told radio host Hugh Hewitt in February that the only acceptable deal with Iran is one that totally ends its enrichment program.
He was one of the 47 Senate Republicans who signed an open letter to Iran’s leaders, warning about potential Congressional opposition to the deal. Rubio’s position: Increase sanctions on Iran until its government “completely gives up its nuclear ambitions.”
Islamic State: Aid local forces in Syria and Iraq.
To defeat ISIS, Rubio would expand air strikes against the group and work to build a stronger multinational coalition. He believes that both ISIS and the Al-Assad government pose threats to stability in the region. The Florida senator would provide arms directly to tribal and Kurdish forces in Iraq.
In addition, Rubio told Fox News he would like a permanent U.S. presence in Iraq to counteract Islamic State and other opposition forces.

Three years ago, 13-year-old “Claude” — a pseudonym used for his protection — had to flee his home in the Democratic Republic of Congo when his village came under attack. He was separated from his mother and he hasn’t seen her since.
Now, living as a refugee in Nairobi, Kenya, with his grandmother, aunt, sister and brother, he still doesn’t feel safe. “My grandmom only wants us to play on the roof because she is afraid we will get hurt or kidnapped in the streets, so we spend a lot of time on the roof,” he told photojournalist Amy Toensing.
Toensing spent three weeks documenting urban refugee children in Nairobi. She and her husband Matt Moyer collaborated on the above video. Their work is now on display at the Salt Gallery in Portland, Maine, until Aug. 8.

Claude said people have threatened him with beatings and that they’ll send him back to DR Congo. Refugees often are blamed for criminal activity in cities, whether they are involved or not.
He is one of 51.2 million people — half of whom are children — who have been forced to leave their homes, mostly due to conflict. That number of forcibly displaced people is now the largest in the post-World War II era, the U.N. refugee agency reported Friday.
Among other findings in the U.N. refugee agency’s annual Global Trends report:
One way to address the enormous refugee problem is to resettle them in other countries. RefugePoint, based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, is one of the organizations working to ensure that receiving countries are using as many slots as are designated per year for resettling refugees.

Last year, the United States filled practically all of its 70,000 resettlement slots with refugees from 65 countries, which Sasha Chanoff, RefugePoint’s founder and executive director, considers a success.
Resettling refugees gives them more options to support themselves and get on with their lives, as opposed to living in a refugee camp for many years, said Chanoff. When people are fleeing countries in conflict, “there’s an emergency response to provide food and health,” he said. “But then there’s no change in that emergency response. One year turns into five years, which turns into 10 years.”
For example, in the world’s largest refugee camp — Dadaab in northeastern Kenya — more than 350,000 refugees and asylum-seekers are living in tents, some since the camp opened 23 years ago.
RefugePoint is working on getting Claude’s family resettled through the U.N. refugee agency. Claude is one of the lucky ones, said Toensing, who met the boy through RefugePoint, because he is being considered for resettlement, though the RefugePoint staff caution that it can take years.

The Israeli government will stop giving birth certificates to babies born to foreigners to prevent the usage of the documentations to claim the right to stay in the country, the Guardian reports. Babies born to foreigners will instead be issued a handwritten hospital birth notice, which will not be considered an official government document.
This new law could affect migrants, diplomats, asylum seekers and international workers later in life when needed to apply for passports or even marriage licenses. Israel said it has no legal obligation to provide birth certificates to foreigners.
Rights groups Association of Civil Rights in Israel, the Hotline for Migrant Workers and Physicians for Human Rights look to challenge the move in court Sunday on behalf of a family from the Democratic Republic of Congo denied a birth certificate. The parents, who have work permits according to The Guardian, were also denied the ability to transfer the father’s last name to their daughter.
The state said in a brief that listing the father’s name would grant legal recognition of paternity without proof, inviting serious legal ramifications.
“Determining paternity is liable to determine the status of father and child in civil law on matters such as inheritance, child support, custody, conversion, names, citizenship, residency, registration in the Population Registry and more,” the brief explained.
Oded Feller, a lawyer with ACRI, told the Guardian: “The state has an obligation to protect the identities of all the children in Israel equally. It is also obligated to grant all children, without discrimination, birth certificates. The interior ministry is not authorized to erase elements of a child’s identity. It is not entitled to cancel the parenthood of fathers who are not Israeli, nor is it authorised to take away the names given to children by their parents.”

Korea, Asylum Ferry Sinks Near Australia","New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson is traveling to North Korea on a personal, privately funded trip intended to ease tensions on the Korean Peninsula. Richardson was invited by North Korea, which has been denied direct talks with the United States and has traded threatening rhetoric with South Korea since the shelling of Yeonpyeong Island on Nov. 23.
Richardson has traveled to North Korea in the past to negotiate the release of jailed Americans, and has served as an unofficial liaison. While the U.S. government is emphasizing that he will not deliver an official message, State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley said that, as with past visits, Richardson will likely “report back after he’s done.”
“If I can contribute to the easing of tension on the peninsula, the trip will be well worth it,” said Richardson.
Before serving as governor of New Mexico, Richardson was ambassador to the United Nations.

Meanwhile, South Korea held a national emergency drill, preparing for a possible military attack. Jets flew low over Seoul and Busan, and students were sent to underground bunkers in the largest drill of its kind in 35 years. North Korea maintains that the provocation is coming from South Korea and has threatened of nuclear retaliation.
Ferry Filled with Asylum Seekers Overturns Near Australia
At least 27 people, including many women and children, are dead after a ferry smashed against a wall of rocks off of Christmas Island, about 750 miles from mainland Australia.
Rescuers were able to pull some survivors from the choppy waters, but some died after being in the water for several hours. The vessel was believed to be carrying asylum seekers from Iran and Iraq.
Prime Minister Julia Gillard is returning from a holiday trip to oversee the rescue and recovery effort.
Bombing at Iranian Mosque Kills at Least 39
Two bombs exploded at a Shia mosque in the city of Chahbahar, killing at least 39 people. A Sunni Muslim rebel group called Jundallah claimed responsibility for the attack, which targeted worshippers marking the mourning period known as Ashura.
Iranian officials said they had arrested a third man after the first was killed in the explosion and a second was killed on scene by police.
Iranian officials are also laying blame on intelligence services in Pakistan and the United States, which it says has supported Jundallah.
ICC Names Suspects in Connection with 2007 Kenya Violence
Prosecutors from the International Criminal Court named seven people, including high-ranking government officials, on charges related to the country’s election-related violence in 2007 and the beginning of 2008.
The violence started when incumbent president Mwai Kibaki declared victory over rival Raila Odinga, who eventually agreed to a power-sharing deal that made him prime minister. The ethnically motivated violence included the burning of a church with people trapped inside and resulted in the deaths of over 1,000 people across the country.

This weekend’s national elections are proving the point again. The two major party leaders both reached their positions stepping over the political corpses of their immediate predecessors. The issue that created the convulsions down under also would be familiar to Americans: climate change. Australia may be, as the writer Bill Bryson famously described it, the “sunburnt country,” but drought and some horrific forest fires have made global warming a top concern of the citizenry. But trying to craft climate change legislation is another matter in an economy heavily dependent on mining and agriculture.
When Australians vote Saturday for their members of parliament (and they face a fine if they fail to show up), they also will have heard debates on the economy and immigration, two other issues familiar to American and other western electorates.
By comparison with the American economy, Australia is thriving, thanks in good measure to China scooping up its minerals and the general Asian economic boom bolstered by Chinese super-growth. Unemployment is 5.3 percent, slightly more than half the U.S. rate. There also has been debate over the deficit, 46 billion Australian dollars, in contrast to U.S. trillion dollar deficits. Australia’s budget probably will be back in balance in four years or less. The ratio of debt to GDP is the lowest in the industrial world at 6 percent.
Immigration has struck an emotional chord in some Australian quarters, most recently fueled by a jump in asylum seekers, including more than 1,000 this year from neighboring Indonesia. There are an estimated 48,000 illegal immigrants among Australia’s 22 million population.
In foreign policy, Australia’s 1,500-troop contribution to the NATO fight in Afghanistan has not yet provoked the political backlash that Vietnam and Iraq did in years past. The tight links between the U.S. and Australia, which go back to World War II when the U.S. assumed the Asian defense burdens of the British Empire, have been reaffirmed by every U.S. president and Australian Prime Minister since, including most recently President Obama and the recently-ousted Labor Prime Minister Kevin Rudd.
By mid-day Saturday in the U.S., we should know if Prime Minister Julia Gillard and her Labor Party have been returned for another term or whether they have been ousted by Tony Abbott and the Liberals (who are really conservative). Gillard, Australia’s first female prime minister, has regained a slight lead in the polls, but a close count is anticipated for all 150 seats in the House and half the Senate.

But Utica is the proverbial exception that proves the rule: immigration has become a hot button topic across America. So what do we do about the immigration in the U.S.? How does immigration play into the negotiation of NAFTA, for example? What do we do about the millions of illegal immigrants already here?
Hannah Carrese, a young scholar who has worked with refugees, most recently in Mexico, has a radical solution to many of these problems — returning America to a policy of the not-so-distant past: the bracero program.
— Paul Solman, Economics Correspondent
Watch Making Sen$e’s broadcast story on Utica, New York, “the town that loves refugees,” above.
America and Europe have spent the past year eulogizing free trade agreements. Politicians, and in some cases voters, have become convinced that free trade means free migration, that free movement of goods inevitably leads to free movement of people.
In the U.K., Brexit voters knew that to remain part of the EU’s single market would be to accept the EU’s permissive border policies. In the U.S., President Donald Trump pulled out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, and has muddled his way to a similar idea as he pledges to renegotiate NAFTA: the U.S. does not want Mexico’s hombres, and the U.S. does not want Mexico’s goods.
This linking of trade and migration makes sense in the European Union, where the “four freedoms” central to the Union’s founding treaties enshrine free movement of goods and free movement of people.
But the link is less clear in the United States. Our country’s preeminent free trade agreement, the North American Free Trade Agreement, is predicated on the idea that free trade discourages migration — that if countries open their borders to goods, they won’t have to worry about closing them to people.
NAFTA negotiators in the U.S. and Mexico agreed on this point as they crafted the treaty. In 1992, for example, Mexican President Carlos Salinas made clear his country’s aim in joining a North American free trade bloc: “we want,” he said, “to export goods, not people.” During a 1993 signing ceremony for NAFTA, former U.S. President Gerald Ford said much the same: “Defeat NAFTA and there will be a tremendous flow of Mexicans to the United States wanting jobs in the United States. We don’t want that. We want Mexicans to stay in Mexico so they can work in their home country.”
Economists provided what seemed a common sense justification for this decoupling of free trade and free migration. If governments and markets and citizens behaved as expected under NAFTA, new factories and farms would spring up in Mexico, opening up new jobs. In this more competitive labor market, and in Mexico’s inevitably growing economy, wages would rise. Of course, Mexicans who had work and were paid well for doing this work would have no incentive to migrate north. Some scholars suggested that Mexican migration to the U.S. would surge as both economies adjusted to new trade patterns. They were sure, however, that this “migration hump” would at its worst reach an apex by the mid-1990s. It would decline thereafter.
But this vision of migration discouraged by free trade proved a mirage. During the 1990s, the population of Mexican nationals living in the U.S. more than doubled, to 9 million people. Migration, legal and illegal, from Mexico to the U.S. kept crescendoing through 2008.
The reasons are clear. One real world effect of NAFTA was that foreign companies built factories primarily in northern Mexico, near the U.S. border. This left the rest of the country bereft of the jobs the treaty, and economists, promised. Another effect: imports like Kansas corn, cheap because the U.S. government subsidized them, inundated Mexico. Millions of farmers of this staple Mexican crop were pushed out of the market, out of their livelihood and often out of their homes. Plans for these sometime corn farmers to become strawberry farmers — occupying a new niche in a new economy — never materialized. Nor did the ambitious infrastructure and development programs promised by Mexico’s government as a method for keeping Mexicans in Mexico.
If NAFTA had not been ratified, would President Ford have proved prophetic? Would the flow of migrants north have been even more tremendous? Perhaps, although we are ill-equipped to tackle this “what if.” But 23 years into NAFTA, we can be sure of this: Presidents Salinas and Ford, and their contemporaries, were premature in pronouncing the decoupling of trade and migration.
It should, then, be no surprise that the “new world order” vaunted by George H. W. Bush and Bill Clinton, the American presidents who negotiated NAFTA, seems also to be failing. NAFTA was, after all, fundamental to Bush and Clinton’s idea of an American-led liberal system of peaceful commerce and international law. Echoing presidential rhetoric, Henry Kissinger wrote in the summer of 1993 that “NAFTA will represent the most creative step toward a new world order by any group of countries since the end of the Cold War, and the first step toward an even larger vision of a free-trade zone for the entire Western Hemisphere.” NAFTA was the contract pledging that the U.S. would construct a new international order after the fall of the Berlin Wall.
Donald Trump — elected president 28 years to the day after the wall was ruptured — will now renegotiate NAFTA in pursuit of another “new world order.” Unlike Presidents Bush and Clinton, who worked to level walls, President Trump lauds them. And once again, questions of trade seem inseparable from those of migration. The manifestation of the Bush/Clinton vision was the successful — although tardy — U.S. intervention to quell a refugee crisis in Bosnia. The impetus for Trump’s vision is in large part a global population of displaced people that has now crested 65 million. These migrants and asylum-seekers are, rightly or wrongly, scaring citizens from Moscow, Russia to Moscow, Idaho.
Therefore, as we renegotiate NAFTA, U.S. politicians and citizens must ask: Is Trump — and are Brexit voters — right? Must we restrict trade in order to restrict migration? How much should we aim to restrict either?
In the U.K., the hope that migration and trade can be decoupled persists, tenaciously if tenuously. Brexit negotiators will work for a deal that allows Britain to restrict immigration while retaining access to the EU’s free trade zone. It is not at all clear they will succeed.
But North Americans should develop a healthier, and a more realistic, answer to these questions. We should recognize the link between trade and migration and craft a new NAFTA, one guided not by the Bush/Clinton new world order but by an older world order, built on this continent during the 1940s: the bracero program.
In need of labor during World War II, U.S. officials reversed a decade of policy hostile to Mexican guest workers and established what became known as the bracero (or manual laborer) program. Mexican migrants worked during the growing season on sugar beet, lettuce, asparagus, grape farms in the U.S. During the winter, they returned home to build houses, celebrate weddings or bury family members. They worked in the United States and lived in Mexico.

In the U.S., braceros were promised a regulated economy: a minimum wage, decent living conditions, food, housing. Under the H2A visa program, the much smaller modern iteration of the bracero program, guest workers are paid wages higher than the state minimum in an effort to ensure that they aren’t “cheap labor,” taking jobs from Americans. Companies must apply for permits to hire workers, to show both that the workers are needed and that they will be cared for in the U.S.
Mexican officials have long been amenable to this kind of program. Presidents George Bush and Vicente Fox discussed establishing a bracero-like initiative before 9/11. In 2016, the Mexican ambassador to the U.S. — now Mexico’s Subsecretary for North America, working to set policy on NAFTA — said of the end of bracero: “the circular migration of the past was broken, and that’s when the problems began … we need to re-establish the movement.”
In fact, Mexico has instituted a guest worker program for citizens of Belize and Guatemala at its own southern border. This program is a component of Mexico’s Southern Border Plan, a 2014 border enforcement law supported by $70 million from the Obama administration. President Trump and Congress should view a new guest worker program in the U.S. as implying the same compromise envisioned in Mexico’s Southern Border Plan: more leeway for legal migration coupled with better enforcement of laws against illegal migration. (Of course, the program should also avoid some of its previous faults. Ten percent of braceros’ salaries were deducted and given to the Mexican government to pass on to workers, but many laborers never received the pay and fought for years for proper compensation. The braceros were eventually paid under a 2008 settlement.)
President Trump should not expect most Mexicans now living without documents in the U.S. to “self-deport” — to return south to Mexico voluntarily. At the end of 2014, 78 percent of the 5.5 million undocumented Mexicans had lived in the U.S. for 10 or more years. These migrants who have made the U.S. their home over a decade or more are not the kind of migrants who typically return to Mexico. The Mexican government reported that from 2009 to 2014, migrants returning to Mexico had lived in the U.S. for an average of just over a year.
This means that we should structure a new guest worker program so that Mexicans living without documents in the U.S. are immediately eligible. To do this would be to recognize an informal migration cycle that already exists in most U.S.-Mexico border towns. Many Mexican nationals living along the border pass frequently between the United States and Mexico. Good “border shoppers” know what to buy in Mexico and in the U.S. In Ciudad Juárez, Mexico, for example, milk, eggs and doctor’s appointments are cheaper than in U.S. And Mexicans seek luxury goods north of the border: when a Coach outlet opened in El Paso recently, it was flooded by Chihuahuans who came to buy handbags.
Comprehensive immigration reform has become a chimera in U.S. politics — exotic and interesting, but impossible. This is in part because there seems no way to begin. Do we start with border enforcement? With amnesty? With deportations? With a work program?
None of these front doors to changing U.S. immigration policy have worked. We should acknowledge the link between trade and migration and try a side door — a NAFTA built around a U.S.-Mexico guest worker program.
The slogan for this new NAFTA, founded in old North American policies, is simple: rather than free trade, free movement — fair trade, fair movement."

Their story, which features three distinct immigration battles within one household, shines a light on the complexities of the U.S. immigration system and the challenges facing reform.
Macky Fofana spends his days flipping pizza dough and his nights searching for news on immigration reform. His soft-spoken younger brother Mohamed is a middle-school basketball star. And then there’s 17-year-old Ramata, fashionista and high school track athlete, who cooks dinner for her two brothers in their three-bedroom Baltimore apartment every evening while their mother and father work.
Macky, who is 21, was recently granted a permit to work here legally under an Obama administration rule issued last summer. Fourteen-year-old Mohamed is, for all practical purposes, without a legal status. Ramata has permission to stay in the U.S. temporarily, due to a judge’s ruling that if she were to return to her native country, she’d almost certainly be pressured to undergo female circumcision. And this year marks the tenth time — but not the last — that parents Coumba Konte and Aliou Fofana must reapply for permission to continue raising their three children in the U.S.
For an individual, attaining U.S. citizenship can be like groping through a maze. For the Fofana family, and the 16 million others living in mixed-status families in the U.S., becoming part of the American dream requires navigating several different mazes, the paths of which are constantly changing. The family arrived in the U.S. more than a decade ago, and while each family member’s goal is the same — to achieve American citizenship — their roads to get there are strikingly different.

Defying Tradition
Coumba, 50, remembers the precise moment her daughter’s secret was discovered. It was 1998. Her mother-in-law was bathing then 2-year-old Ramata, in their rural town in central Mali, when she realized the girl’s clitoris was still intact.
Her relatives were furious, Coumba says, and accused her of shaming them by going against tradition in a country where more than 80 percent of women across all swaths of social stature and education levels undergo female genital mutilation, most of them at a young age. The most common form involves cutting off the clitoris with a saw-toothed knife, and Coumba, who was circumcised herself as a child and describes the still-lingering pain as unbearable, says she couldn’t stand to watch her daughter grow up the same way. Instead, she and her husband lied and said their daughter had the procedure done shortly after her birth.

Mothers in Mali are often powerless to stop the barbarity. More than half of girls who have undergone the procedure are daughters of mothers who oppose it, according to a recent UNICEF study. In Mali, Coumba explains, children belong to the whole society, not just to the parents. That means any family member “can just come and take your daughter, and just do it,” she says. “There is no law against it; there is nowhere you can go to complain. It’s tradition.”
In Mali, Coumba explains, children belong to the whole society, not just to the parents. Before the discovery, “life in Mali was good,” Coumba says. She had a master’s degree in veterinary science and owned her own business, buying cows and reselling them at a profit after they had been vaccinated and deemed healthy. In addition to Ramata, she and her husband had two healthy sons, Macky and Mohamed.
But after her lie was discovered, life became unbearable. Relatives tried on several occasions to kidnap Ramata to perform the procedure.
On the pretense of taking a two-week vacation, Coumba threw her family’s most precious belongings in suitcases and left for the United States, using a temporary visitor’s visa. She arrived on August 21, 2003, with three children under the age of 12, joining her husband, who had arrived earlier to get settled. No one in the family spoke English.
Eleven years later, husband and wife both hold full-time jobs — Aliou as co-owner of a transportation company and Coumba as a nursing assistant — and pay sales and income taxes. Even so, their ultimate dream of becoming American citizens quickly became tangled in U.S. immigration limbo, with various paths to citizenship and legal statuses that can and do change at any moment.

The winter after she entered the U.S., Coumba contacted a human rights organization to try to find a way to stay in the country legally. In the four-and-a-half months since her family’s arrival, she had learned English through courses at the local community college, bringing the total number of languages in which she was proficient to five. She enrolled her children in public school and found work braiding hair in a beauty salon — not her dream career after working as a highly-educated veterinarian, but a job just the same.
The path to secure a place for her children in their new country, however, has been full of twists and turns.
Temporary Stay of Deportation
In 2004, Coumba suffered two life-threatening ectopic pregnancies, both requiring surgery, in less than four months. Once back on her feet, she met with immigration attorney Edward Neufville. She applied for asylum on the basis that her daughter would be subjected to female circumcision if the family was sent back to Mali. In her court interview, Neufville says that although “for all intents and purposes the asylum officer believed her,” it came down to the fact she hadn’t applied in time.
She had missed the one-year deadline after her arrival to file for asylum.
Coumba keeps all of her hospital records neatly stored in a thick, red three-ring binder. Had she known about the deadline, she says, she would have applied sooner — even if she had to crawl. But when you’re that sick, she says, it’s hard to do anything. “And time doesn’t wait,” she adds.
Not everyone sympathizes with her situation. “She didn’t assert her claim on a timely basis,” says Dan Stein, president of the Federation for American Immigration Reform, an advocacy group that favors lowering immigration rates to the U.S.
“Our asylum system has become a fraud-ridden mess, partly because the basis for providing proof is almost non-existent.”
“Our asylum system has become a fraud-ridden mess, partly because the basis for providing proof is almost non-existent,” he says. And when asylum-seekers don’t play by the rules, Stein maintains, they should suffer the consequences.
“You’re asking to jump ahead of a line of tens of millions of other people who would like to live here. We’re within our rights to ask a person to make a claim immediately.”
Despite a supportive letter from a human rights group vouching for her good intentions, the immigration judge didn’t budge. And that’s not rare. According to a 2010 study by Georgetown and Temple University law professors, more than 20,000 refugees who otherwise met the criteria for asylum have been denied due to missing that one-year deadline since it was first established in 1998.
Instead of being granted asylum, Coumba was granted a temporary stay of deportation, known as “withholding status,” along with her daughter and husband. In other words, the judge technically ordered them deported, but allowed them to stay in the country for one year. They must renew the stay annually and report to immigration court every three months.
Coumba says she lives in constant fear of being sent back and wonders why she is always instructed to bring her family’s passports with her when they go for renewal. Any given year, she says, “we could be deported. We don’t know.”
The broader point, Stein argues, is that the longer people remain in the U.S. in some kind of illegal status, the more complex the situation becomes, and the more difficult it is to find solutions.

Indeed, Coumba’s two other children were not covered through the measure. “The judge said for the sons, there was nothing really we could do,” says attorney Neufville. “They couldn’t ride on top of the sister.”
But the family accepted the withholding offer, deciding it was better to have half the family covered than none. The Department of Homeland Security put the two brothers under an order of supervision that allowed them to stay in the country, temporarily, for the cost to the family of about $700 per son each year.
“If you’re under supervision, you can apply for employment authorization, but it’s not a status. It’s much more of a limbo,” Neufville says. Technically, “they had no status.”
Individuals with withholding status, like Coumba, Aliou and Ramata, do not have the same rights as refugees who have been granted asylum. They cannot apply for legal permanent residence or travel outside the United States. And, though it happens rarely, if Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials determine that conditions in an immigrant’s host country have become safe, they can re-open the case and try to revoke the stay. Immigrants with stays of deportation can work in the U.S., as long as their work authorization is renewed annually. Similar to those with asylum, Coumba is eligible to receive welfare, Medicaid, Supplemental Security Income, food stamps and certain government housing subsidies for up to seven years, although her family has never taken advantage of these programs.
Death of a Senate Bill
Meanwhile, recent high school graduate Macky, who had begun attending community college with the goal of transferring to a four-year school and eventually studying criminal justice, discovered he was eligible for a new kind of work permit. The Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program announced by the Obama administration in June 2012 cost him $465 to apply, less than the $715 he had been paying for the supervision status he shared with his little brother.
He was approved in December, one of roughly 522,000 people to be accepted since the program went into effect. The nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute estimates that some 1.1 million young people are eligible. After two years, Macky can apply to renew his temporary status. But he hopes that by then, there will be another option for him.
And that’s where Congress comes in.
In June 2013, the Senate, after months of heated rhetoric from both sides of the aisle, reached a bipartisan agreement on a comprehensive immigration reform bill. It included a $46 billion plan to ramp up security along the U.S.-Mexico border and established a 13-year path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants who passed the necessary background and criminal checks, paid penalties and fees and learned English, among other requirements.
Republican leaders in the House insist they are open to immigration reform, and Speaker John Boehner gave positive signs after a GOP retreat in January, releasing a list of Republican principles for enacting reform in a piecemeal fashion.
But the following week, Boehner walked back his earlier optimism, stating in a Feb. 6 news conference that many Republicans couldn’t “trust” President Obama to implement changes to the law, and casting doubt on the prospects for any kind of agreement this year.
Many Republican strategists think that’s fine. William Kristol, editor of the conservative Weekly Standard, dismisses the argument that a lack of action on immigration reform will hurt his party’s reputation in a country whose demographics are changing rapidly.
“I think doing nothing won’t have much in the way of consequences,” says Kristol, who isn’t convinced that Democrats are as committed to reform as they claim to be.
“I’ve been around politics for a long time,” he says. “If something is a good issue, the Democrats would be talking about it. But what are they talking about? Not immigration reform — minimum wage. It’s because they know people like it. They feel that’s more of a winner than immigration.”
Macky, who in his spare time volunteers with a Maryland advocacy group to promote immigration reform, is trying not to lose hope as he follows the developments on Capitol Hill.
He considers himself a citizen of this country, even if the law doesn’t. He grew up here, but his first language is French. “I don’t even speak it anymore, so imagine … where would I begin if I went back home? It doesn’t make sense.”
Macky knows he is safe for the next two years because of his work permit, but says that until actual legislation passes, it’s impossible to know what the future holds for him or his family.
“A path to citizenship, that’s what I’m hoping for,” he says.
What would change for Macky and his family if a bill that included a path to citizenship became law? For one, they could stop living in fear.
“From my read of what came out of the Senate, they’d have an option to apply and have that provisional status for 10 years,” says Neufville. “This is a woman who speaks French, English and Russian and has her degree in veterinary science. What’s holding her back is if she applies for work, people say, ‘How long can you work here for?’”
Under Coumba’s current stay of deportation, she has no path to citizenship. “You’re kind of stuck,” says Neufville, “unless your circumstances change. If her daughter were to, for instance, marry a U.S. citizen, she could come back and reopen her deportation proceedings and potentially get her residence status through that.”
For Ramata, who fears deportation “all the time,” citizenship is appealing for a more pressing reason: the prospect of financial aid.
Ramata’s high school guidance counselor called the house recently to ask Coumba why her daughter hadn’t applied for aid to the colleges she was pursuing. Under current law, undocumented students are not eligible for state or federal financial aid, although they can apply for private scholarships.
“I explained our situation,” Coumba says, adding that it just feels “wrong” to be “left to the sidewalk.”
Another drawback is that those under withholding status are not permitted to travel outside the U.S. For Coumba — who in addition to her parents in Mali has a sister in Paris — that hurts. When her father died recently, she couldn’t travel to her home country for his funeral, for fear of not being allowed re-entry into the U.S.
“It’s really hard, but what can we do,” she says, tearing up as she recalls comforting her mom, whom she hasn’t seen in more than 10 years, over Skype.
“On the one hand,” says her lawyer, “you’re allowed to work and remain here, but it’s also kind of a dead end, as long as the situation back home remains the same.”
And that situation, as Coumba sees it, is not changing anytime soon.
“I cannot imagine my daughter going back home,” she says. Female circumcision can be performed at any age, and “there are some people waiting for the moment the girl is getting married to perform it.”
A 2004 letter sent to Coumba by her relatives in Mali supported this fear, accusing her of committing “sacrilege” with her “unpardonable” behavior, and warning: “Ramata must pass this way like all the others. She is not going to be an exception to this tradition.”
Meanwhile, Macky has a routine at the end of every day. His shift at the pizza place ends around 2 a.m., and by the time he gets home, showers and heats up leftovers from the refrigerator for a late dinner, it’s usually close to 4 a.m. No matter how tired he is, just before he collapses into bed in the room he shares with his brother Mohamed, he searches the Internet for news on immigration reform. And then he turns out the light.

And why did the inhabitants leave? It’s a natural curiosity, says Andre Govia, a photographer and urban explorer, but fear of getting in trouble and the unknowns within prevent most people from walking inside. Undeterred, Govia began exploring abandoned buildings in 1999.
The decaying buildings and derelict landscapes he encountered were often vandalized, demolished or converted into newer structures. To preserve a record of the unseen history decomposing before him, he brought a camera. Soon, documentation turned to art.

In December, Govia released, “Abandoned Planet,” a book that contains 380 of the thousands of photographs he has taken during his adventures. The book is filled with images of deserted hospitals, hotels, schools, theme parks, mansions, cottages, car graveyards and industrial spaces. In all, the explorer has visited more than 900 locations in about 22 countries.
“I went to Germany 15 times last year, also Portugal, Spain, France, Holland, Austria, America, Sweden and Norway, and we have Iceland coming up and maybe Russia,” Govia told Art Beat.

Every place decays differently, Govia said. North Wales, for example, has a dense, “black” decay. In New Jersey, the decay is “very green.” The Catskills have a “more deep-set decay,” whereas Miami, Spain or Portugal has a “very dusty decay.”
“You can kind of tell where a place is if you know what your decay is,” said Govia. “I rather enjoy it — the different decay and different smells.”

In British mansions, hidden away from society and preserved just as its inhabitants left them 20 or 30 years earlier, Govia might find an unmade bed or a jacket hanging on a doorknob. In Germany and Italy, he saw beautiful paintings decorating ceilings and sculptures in homes and hospitals.
“Even the mental asylums and the crematoriums in Italy have painted ceilings, it’s amazing. You’ll be in an operating theater, and you’ll look up, and it’s got painted ceilings with God knows what on it, cherubs,” Govia said.

Despite the beauty, he is quick to point out the dangers. Thin floor boards, disintegrating roofs, asbestos and rampant nails are just a few to contend with, not to mention the security systems. Govia himself has fallen into a few basements; he’s seen friends land on nails or break their legs and even their necks – and these are the seasoned explorers. Govia remembers watching a security guard walk toward him and fall through the very floor that he just walked over.
“I’m not a photographer who wants to try my luck at taking photos in an abandoned location that looks cool. It’s dangerous, it’s guerrilla, and you have to know the hazards.”

So Govia and his network of urban explorers keep their locations secret. They don’t want unskilled adventure seekers getting hurt and they want to protect the buildings from getting further destroyed. In fact, the explorers have a code — and they adhere to it strictly.
“We don’t damage anything. We don’t break into a building … We never remove items from a building, never deface a building. We’re there to actually capture the glory of the building,” said Govia. “If somebody is found to have removed an item or someone is found to have damaged a property to gain entry, then they are very much frowned upon and often outcast.”

That code is shared different types of urban explorers, whether they climb on rooftops to see far-reaching aerial views from above the city, abseil into the sewers and underground tunnels to experience the often ignored subterranean worlds or, like Govia, explore the overlooked corners on ground level.
The photographer has rules for his art, as well. He will not bring anything in or out of a building, but if a photo needs something, he might move a chair from the hallway or lift some family portraits off the floors to help capture the essence of the room. He uses objects in the space to enhance the feeling of the photograph.

There are very few descriptions in “Abandoned Planet.” Govia doesn’t want to disrupt how the viewer perceives the space – and in the end, he doesn’t think it’s important if you assume a hallway is from a hospital if it’s actually from a hotel or a school.
“I wouldn’t want to taint your vision of what you’re seeing … it’s cinematic photography and it’s trying to put you in the photo so you can almost feel the ambiance within the location.”

Viewers also come to the book for different reasons. Some are those interested in the fantasy-like photography, some are excited by the curiosity of urban exploration, and others are attracted to the historical documentation and access to aspects of life they would never normally see.
“You don’t have to like abandoned buildings to like the photography, and you don’t have to appreciate the photography to like the abandoned buildings.”
