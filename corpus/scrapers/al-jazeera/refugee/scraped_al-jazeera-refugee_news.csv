https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/11/aid-trucks-reach-remote-refugee-camp-syria-181103123205889.html,refugee,587,Sat Nov 03 2018 15:46:22 GMT+0000,None,UN aid trucks reach remote refugee camp in Syria,"A United Nations aid convoy has reached Rukban refugee camp in Syria, next to the border with Jordan, where thousands of people are stranded, a member of the camp's local council has said.
""The first convoys have entered the camp,"" said Abu Abdullah, a member of the civilian council that runs the camp and coordinates with the UN on humanitarian aid, on Saturday.
UN humanitarian coordinator in Syria, Ali Al-Za'tari, said in a statement the situation in the camp is critical. It is the first time since January that the displaced Syrians have received aid.
""We are delivering food, sanitation and hygiene supplies, nutrition and health assistance in addition to other core relief items in cooperation with the Syrian Arab Red Crescent,"" Al-Za'tari said.
""We are also conducting an emergency vaccination campaign to protect some 10,000 children against measles, polio and other deadly diseases.""
He added that although Saturday's arrival of help was a good first step, a long-term solution is needed for the refugees in Rukban.
""We must do everything we can to continue helping civilians living in the harshest conditions in there,"" he said.
Rukban, located close to the Tanf US military base in the desert near where the borders of Syria, Jordan and Iraq converge, is home to more than 50,000 people.
Last month, the camp was besieged on the Syrian side of the border by its army, preventing smugglers and traders from delivering food.
A US-backed rebel group controls the area, but it abuts Jordan's border and is encircled by the Syrian army.

According to Madeline Edwards, associate editor with the news website Syria Direct, conditions in the camp have become worse over the last month.
""Conditions have gotten worse after a major smuggling route that used to bring in basic medical supplies and food into the camp was cut off,"" Edwards told Al Jazeera.
""We're seeing a huge shortage of food, medicine and basic items like baby formula."" she said, adding that prices had increased signigicantly for items still available in the camp.
Last month, residents of the camp sent a letter to the UN and the Jordanian government, appealing for their help in lifting the blockade which they described as a ""slow death"".
""Children and babies are dying because of the siege enforced by the Syrian regime and her allies 10 days ago,"" the letter stated.
""If this situation continues, the camp will become a cemetery for its people"", it said.
Jordan has put a block on aid crossing the frontier after allowing the January delivery through its territory, and says it should not be held responsible for conditions in the camp.
Edwards said Jordan is claiming the camp is a Syrian problem, whereas those involved in the Syrian crisis are putting the blame on each other.
UN relief trucks had planned to deliver aid to Rukban a week ago after gaining clearance from Damascus, but were delayed for logistical and security reasons, the UN said.
Shortages of food and medicine at the camp have caused at least a dozen deaths in recent weeks. The UN described the conditions as ""concerning"" and said thousands of lives were at risk.
Syria's civil war has killed more than 360,000 people and displaced millions since it started with the brutal repression of anti-government protests in 2011.

The child died of malnutrition in a refugee camp in northern Yemen, her family told the Times on Thursday.
""My heart is broken,"" Mariam Ali, the girl's mother, was quoted as saying.
""Amal was always smiling. Now, I'm worried for my other children.""
The Times also quoted Mekkia Mahdi, a Yemeni doctor who had treated the girl shortly before her death, as saying: ""We have many more cases like her.""
A starving Yemini child captured in photos by @NYTimes last week has died.Amal Hussain was 7-years-old.""My heart is broken,"" her mother said. ""Amal was always smiling. Now I'm worried for my other children."" https://t.co/O0uRcNv2Ca pic.twitter.com/JVzRm3P24N
The photograph by Pulitzer Prize-winner Tyler Hicks, which showed the emaciated girl lying on a bed inside a mobile UNICEF clinic in Aslam, touched a nerve with people across the world and sparked an outcry over a crisis that has been called by the United Nations the worst in the word.
Speaking to The Takeaway radio programme earlier this week, described how photographing Amal was ""difficult"" and ""heartbreaking"" but also ""important."" ""She really sums up how tragic and how bad the malnutrition and the starvation have really become in Yemen,"" the photographer said.
Yemen, the Arab world's poorest country, has been embroiled in a devastating war since September 2014, when Houthi fighters swept into the capital, Sanaa, and overthrew President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi's internationally recognised government.
Worried by the rise of the Houthis, believed to be backed by regional rival Iran, a Saudi-UAE-led military coalition launched an intervention in 2015 in the form of a massive air campaign aimed at reinstalling Hadi's government.
Civilians, including children, have borne the brunt of the conflict which has killed at least 10,000 people since the coalition intervened in Yemen, according to the UN. The death toll has not been updated in years and is likely to be far higher. The Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project (ACLED), an independent watchdog, recently said around 56,000 Yemenis had been killed in the violence.
The UN has repeatedly criticised the alliance's bombing campaign and placed it on a blacklist of child rights violators last year.
Last week, UN humanitarian chief Mark Lowcock told the UN Security Council that Yemen is in danger of being engulfed by an ""imminent and great big famine"" that could affect 14 million people, or around half of the population. Lowcock said that the looming famine could be ""bigger than anything any professional in this field has encountered during their working lives"".
The cost of food has increased by 35 percent in the last 12 months and if trends continue the riyal will reach an exchange rate of 1,000 to the US dollar, UN officials have also warned.
""Lack of food, displacement, poor nutrition, disease outbreaks and eroding healthcare"" have also affected 1.1 million malnourished and lactating women, and if the situation continues to deteriorate, up to two million mothers may be increasingly at risk of death,"" the UN Population Fund reported on Thursday.

The government has been under mounting pressure over its treatment of the children.
Some have languished on Nauru for as many as five years and doctors and refugee groups have expressed increasing concern about their health and well-being. Some 46 children were born on Nauru.
Activists said there were currently 38 children on the island. Men are sent to a separate camp in Papua New Guinea.
""There are hardly any children on Nauru ... and we expect that by the end of this year, there will be none,"" Australia's top diplomat in Britain, High Commissioner George Brandis, told the London radio station LBC.
""Children have been transferred off Nauru, that's been happening for some time,"" Prime Minister Scott Morrison told Sydney Radio 2GB on Thursday.
""It's been done in accordance with our policies, our existing policies, and I obviously don't go into the operational arrangements,"" he added.
When Morrison took over as prime minister in August, there were 113 asylum-seeker children on Nauru. Last week, the government said that number was down to 52.
Australia has all but stopped people trying to get to the country by boat since it announced five years ago that anyone who tried to claim asylum after arriving by sea would never be allowed to settle.
Instead, people were sent to detention centres in the Pacific.
Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton has warned any asylum seekers who attempt to reach Australia by boat will continue to be sent to Nauru no matter their age.
Pressure has mounted on Australia to make an exception for children, amid reports of serious physical and mental health problems among those held.
Asylum Seekers Resource Center Director Jana Favero said 47 children, plus 88 adult family members, had been brought to Australia from Nauru in the past two weeks.
The children were provided medical treatment and none of the families were told they could stay in Australia, she said.
""The condition of the children has been pretty shocking,"" Favero said. ""We have seen children not eating or drinking for days in a comatose state. The mental and physical conditions of these children on Nauru have been devastating.""
The United States agreed in 2016 to accept up to 1,250 refugees from Nauru and Papua New Guinea. But after more than a year of screening, only 439 have found new homes there.
New Zealand has also offered to take some of the refugees, but Australia has declined the offer because it fears that would allow asylum seekers to enter through the ""back door"". New Zealanders are allowed to live and work in Australia for as long as they like.
A YouGov Galaxy national poll taken last month found 79 percent of respondents wanted the government to take up New Zealand's offer to accept 150 children and their families.
Human rights lawyer George Newhouse said his organisation, National Justice Project, had taken court action to bring about 50 children to Australia for medical treatment, including kids who have been taken directly from the airport to intensive care units because their organs were failing.
""It's taken court hearings and a groundswell from the community to get the government to act to get these kids off Nauru,"" Newhouse said.

The IOM's tally, which mainly focuses mostly on migrants heading to Europe, stood at 28,500 as of October 1.
The Associated Press reported on Thursday that an additional 28,300 people had either died or gone missing according to data it compiled from international groups, forensic records, missing persons reports, death records, and interviews with migrants and refugees.
As an example, the AP said that when 800 people died in an April 2015 shipwreck off the coast of Italy, Italian investigators had pledged to identify them and find their families. More than three years later, under a new populist government, funding for this work was being cut off.
Beyond Europe, the AP said information on the fate of migrants was even more scarce.
Little was known about the toll in South America, where migration among Venezuelans was among the world's biggest today. Or in Asia, the leading region for migration.
""No matter where you stand on the whole migration management debate ... these are still human beings on the move,"" said Bram Frouws, the head of the Mixed Migration Centre, which surveyed more than 20,000 migrants and refugees since 2014.
""Whether it's refugees or people moving for jobs, they are human beings.""
Despite talk of the 'waves' of African migrants trying to cross the Mediterranean, as many 16 million people migrate within Africa, the AP said.
Since 2014, at least 18,400 African migrants had died travelling within the continent, according to the figures compiled from AP and IOM records. That figure included more than 4,300 unidentified bodies in the South African province of Gauteng.
Zimbabwean migrant Kholakele, who entered South Africa illegally three years ago, said she had heard stories of people going missing.
Afraid that one day they will end up as anonymous bodies in the streets of Johannesburg, where crime rates and traffic accidents are steep, she told the AP that she barely let her five children out of sight.
""If one of them stays away for longer than 10 minutes, we phone them,"" Kholakele said.
With a prosperous economy and stable government, South Africa draws more migrants than any other country in Africa.

In a report published on Tuesday, Human Rights Watch (HRW) said while the law, passed in September, serves as an ""example for the region"", it still imposes ""restrictions on freedom of movement and expression"".
""Qatar's asylum law is a huge step forward in a region made up of wealthy states that have historically shut their doors to refugees,"" Lama Fakih, deputy Middle East director at the HRW, said in a release.
""But Qatar should go further and amend the law so that it fully aligns with its obligations under international human rights and refugee law,"" she added.
Qatar's asylum law was among a batch of legislations on residency in the Gulf state passed on September 4 by Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani.
One of the laws abolished exit permits for most migrant workers, the other allowed people to apply for permanent residency for the first time.
The new asylum law addresses any person ""unable or unwilling to return"" to his country due to a ""justified"" fear of execution or torture over ""ethnicity, religion, affiliation with a group or political beliefs.""
The landmark laws were passed as Qatar prepares to host the 2022 football World Cup even as a Saudi-led blockade continues since June last year.
However, the HRW points out that the asylum law still prevents the refugees from engaging in any political activity while residing in Qatar. It also does not allow them free movement within the country.
The law also allows a rejected asylum petitioner to appeal to the prime minister but does not permit an appeal before a court or judicial tribunal for a full examination of both facts and points of law.
HRW says such provisions violate the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, a human rights treaty Qatar joined earlier this year.
Despite restrictions, the law received recognition, with Sara Leah Whitson, executive director of the Middle East and North Africa division at HRW, calling it a ""big deal"".
Great news that #Qatar has passed region’s first Asylum Law - real security for political exiles in region, hopefully a model for other GCC states who have no asylum or refugee laws. This is a very big deal.
In recent years, the Gulf countries have come under pressure from the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to sign on and develop legal systems to process refugeess.
Currently, more than five million displaced Syrians live in various countries in the Middle East and North Africa, according to the UNHCR.
Nearly a million Syrian refugees also moved to Europe as asylum seekers since the conflict began in 2011.

The Great March of Return rallies culminated on May 15 to mark what Palestinians refer to as the Nakba, or Catastrophe - a reference to the forced removal of 750,000 Palestinians from their homes and villages to clear the way for Israel's establishment in 1948.
The mass Friday demonstrations have continued since.
Since the protests began on March 30, Israeli forces have killed at least 210 Palestinians in the besieged coastal enclave and wounded more than 18,000 people, according to health officials in Gaza.
A Palestinian was killed by Israeli fire during ongoing protests along the Israeli separation fence east of Gaza, according to the enclave's health ministry.
The health ministry's spokesperson, Ashraf al-Qidra, identified the man as 27-year-old Mohammed Abd al-Hay Abu Abada from al-Shati refugee camp in northern Gaza.
Three Palestinian boys aged between 13 and 14 were killed in an Israeli air strike in the southeastern Gaza Strip near the fence with Israel, according to health officials.

Israeli soldiers have wounded at least 130 Palestinians including 25 children, according to the spokesman for the Palestinian health ministry, Ashraf al-Qidra.
The official said protesters had been targeted with live ammunition and that there had not been any Palestinian fatality thus far during Friday's protest.
It was the 30th consecutive Friday that Palestinian demonstrators converged on the Gaza-Israel buffer zone to protest Israel's decades-long occupation.
Israeli forces have killed seven Palestinians, including two teenage boys, during ongoing protests along the Israeli separation fence east of Gaza, according to the enclave's health ministry.
Four Palestinians were killed along the fence east of Al-Bureij in the centre of the Gaza Strip, while one died east of Gaza City, Dr Ashraf al-Qedra, spokesman for the health ministry, said.

""We're ready for negotiations with Israel - either in public or behind closed doors - with the [Middle East] Quartet as sponsor,"" said Abbas.
The so-called Middle East Quartet is comprised of the US, Russia, the UN and the EU.

Friday, August 31
More than 200 wounded across the Gaza Strip
At least 240 Palestinians have been injured by Israeli forces in Friday's protest, according to Ashraf al-Qidra, the spokesperson for the ministry of health in Gaza.
Two cases - a female medic and a 10-year-old child - were in serious condition.
Qidra also said that an ambulance belonging to the Red Crescent was targeted by Israeli forces north of the Strip, resulting in broken windows and injuring one medic.
Mueen al-Masry, who was hit in the chest with a tear gas canister inside the vehicle, was taken to the nearest hospital for treatment.
50 Palestinians wounded by live bullets
Israeli forces fired live bullets and tear gas at protesters near the fence with Israel, wounding at least 189 Palestinians, according to health officials in Gaza.
Of those injured, 50 were hit by live bullets, Palestinian news agency Wafa reported.
""We've seen a lot of tear gas fired ... [and] what sounds like live ammunition as well,"" said Al Jazeera's Charles Stratford, reporting from the protests.
Approximately, 5,000 people attended Friday's demonstration, the 22nd Friday of rallies.
""There are fewer people here this week that we've seen in recent weeks,"" said Stratford.
""Some ... think that one of the reasons why the protests are being [attended by fewer people] this week is because we are expecting the resumptions of the talks being mediated by the Egyptians in Cairo, between Hamas and Israel.
""Israel denies that there is any direct conversation going ... but we do know the Egyptians are being very keen and are working very hard to get both parties to agree to some sort of lasting ceasefire,"" he added.
Palestinian killed in Rafah
Ashraf al-Qidra, the spokesperson for Gaza's ministry of health, said a second Palestinian had been shot dead by Israeli forces on Friday.
Sa'di Akram Muammar, 26, was killed east of Rafah, in the southern Gaza Strip.
The number of wounded protesters has risen to 270.
One killed, scores wounded
One Palestinian has been killed by Israeli forces, according to health officials in Gaza.
Karim Abu Fatayer, 30, died after being shot in the head by an Israeli sniper.
Health officials said 154 other protesters were wounded, including four medics who suffocated from tear gas.
Abu Fatayer's death brings the number of Palestinian protesters killed since March 30 to 165.
'Quiet build-up' to this week's protest
According to the Gaza Ministry of Health, at least 10 Palestinians have been injured near the Israeli fence.
Speaking from Gaza, Al Jazeera's Charles Stratford said that the protests have been quiet so far.
""So far today we've seen far less of the incendiary balloons and kites that Israel says have caused so much damage across the border,"" he said.
""It has been quiet in the build-up to this week's protest, and we saw that Israel has allowed the opening of Gaza's only commercial crossing Karem Abu Salem earlier this week, and expand the restricted area which the fishermen can operate,"" he continued.
""It's vital if this calm is going to be maintained between Israel and Hamas that neither side commits what either side perceive as being a provocation.""
There have also been reports circulating in Israeli media of an Egypt-UN mediated agreement between Hamas and Israel being reached, which includes an extended ceasefire.
""There's also been talk of potentially the rebuilding of some of Gaza's infrastructure using foreign funding, and a lot of emphasis on a prisoner exchange as well,"" Stratford said.
""But Hamas has not confirmed these reports, and there hasn't been an official statement regarding these talks from the Israeli side.""
Gaza flotilla to protest against Israeli blockade
Palestinian fishermen in the Gaza Strip are set to stage a protest against Israel's nearly 12-year land, air and sea blockade of the enclave.
Protest organisers told Al Jazeera that around 40 to 50 boats are expected to leave the Gaza port on Saturday and sail north towards Israel.
""The protesting fishermen are highlighting their suffering and the restrictions they are under because of the Israeli blockade,"" said Al Jazeera's Charles Stratford, reporting from the Gaza port. ""Fifty thousand families are in some way dependent on the fishing industry here.""
Last month, Israel's defence minister restricted Gaza's fishing boundaries from six to three nautical miles off the coast.
The Israeli navy intercept ships attempting to breach the naval blockade, and often fire on fishermen who cross into restricted areas.
Also enforced by Egypt, the blockade has been in place since Hamas began administering the Strip in 2007.
Two Israeli drone strikes, two injured
Israeli drone strikes in Gaza targeting Palestinian protesters trying to launch incendiary balloons and kites across the fence with Israel have wounded at least two people, sources have told Al Jazeera.
""In the last hour or so, there was one [strike] in Beit Hanoun in the north of Gaza - no casualties reported there,"" Al Jazeera's Charles Stratford, reporting from Gaza, said on Saturday afternoon
""The second strike in the east of the central region injured at least two people,"" he added.
UN delegation to meet Hamas officials
A UN delegation representing the special coordinator for the peace process, Nickolay Mladenov, has arrived in Gaza for meetings with Hamas officials.
The visit is part of an ongoing effort to lower tensions between Hamas and Israel. The talks are expected to focus on the details of a ceasefire proposal.
Al Jazeera's Charles Stratford, reporting from Gaza, said that no lines have come out of the meetings so far.
""These meetings with Hamas are pretty much always behind closed doors, but what they do suggest is this incredible urgency that is needed in order to try and establish some sort of lasting truce between Hamas and Israel after the escalations in recent weeks,"" he said.
Thousands pay last respects to three Palestinians killed
Thousands of Palestinians on Saturday attended funerals for three Palestinians killed by Israeli gunfire a day earlier.
Mourners laid volunteer paramedic Abdullah al-Qutiti, 22, to rest in the southern city of Rafah. Saeed Aloul, 55, and Ahmed Abu Louli, 40, were also buried in Rafah amid angry chants against Israel by mourners.
Palestinian dies after being shot at protest
A 40-year-old Palestinian hit by Israeli fire during protests on the Gaza border died of his wounds on Saturday, taking the previous day's death toll to three, the territory's health ministry said.
He was among at least 131 Palestinians wounded by Israeli bullets during Friday's protests, even as an informal truce agreed after a deadly flare-up between Gaza's rulers Hamas and the Israeli army largely held.
The health ministry identified the dead man as Ahmed Abu Louli and said he was shot in a section of the border east of the southern city of Rafah, where two other Palestinians were also killed.
Two Palestinians killed, hundreds wounded by Israeli forces
Israeli forces have shot dead two Palestinians, including one volunteer paramedic, according to health officials in the Gaza Strip, as protesters gathered along the Israeli border fence for the 20th week.
Abdullah al-Qatiti, a 26-year-old paramedic, and Saeed Aloul, 55, were shot and killed in southern Gaza on Friday, health ministry spokesman Ashraf al-Qidra said.
Hundreds of others were injured, with 176 being treated on the field and 131 taken to hospital, added al-Qidra
""There is a lot of tear gas being fired by the Israeli military using drones,"" said Al Jazeera's Charles Stratford, reporting from the protests in Gaza.
""The coming hours will be critical,"" he added. ""It is tense here and there are fears that if there is any serious provocation by either side, we could yet again see another escalation in violence.""
This week's protests, which follow deadly Israeli air attacks and artillery shelling on the besieged enclave, began at around 14:00 GMT.
The demonstrations come a day after Hamas and Israel reached an Egypt-brokered deal to end the flare-up in violence. But the Israeli government has not officially confirmed the agreement.
EU sounds alarm over Gaza violence
The European Union says a recent escalation of violence ""has brought Gaza and Israel dangerously close to yet more conflict"", adding that an urgent ""de-escalation"" was needed to keep civilians from further risk.
On Wednesday, Israeli forces killed at least three people in Gaza, including a 23-year-old woman, who was almost nine months pregnant, and her 18-month-old daughter.
The Israeli military launched more than 140 attacks after about 150 rockets were fired from the coastal enclave.
A statement by Hamas' military force said it was responsible for the rockets. It said the Palestinian ""resistance"" had fired a large number of projectiles at ""enemy positions in the Gaza envelope"".
""The rocket fire from Gaza towards communities in southern Israel as well as other violent actions and provocations against Israel by Hamas and other Palestinian militants are totally unacceptable,"" an EU foreign affairs spokesperson said in a statement on Friday.
""While having the right to defend itself, Israel is expected to continue to exercise restraint and do everything to avoid civilian casualties in Gaza. The death of a pregnant Palestinian mother and her child in this latest escalation is a tragic loss.""
A Palestinian teenager has died from his wounds after being shot in the abdomen by Israeli forces during a protest on Friday.
Muaz al-Suri, 15, was demonstrating near Gaza's fence with Israel when he was shot east of the Bureij refugee camp. He died early Saturday, the health ministry said.
Palestinian killed by Israeli army sniper
A Palestinian man has been shot dead by Israeli soldiers and at least 220 others were wounded during protests near the fence with Israel in the Gaza Strip, according to Palestinian health officials.
Ahmed Yaghi, 25, was killed by a sniper east of Gaza city, health ministry spokesman Ashraf Al-Qidra said.
Of the 220 injured, 90 suffered wounds as a result of live fire, he added.
Hamas leaders to discuss ceasefire deal
Several exiled Hamas leaders have entered Gaza to discuss a ceasefire deal brokered by Egypt and the UN.
Prominent leader Saleh al-Arouri, who is wanted by Israel, returned from Lebanon for the first time since 2010 to attend the talks scheduled for Friday.
He crossed the border from Egypt on Thursday, after Egyptian and UN assurances over his safety, with eight other Hamas leaders based outside the besieged Gaza Strip.
Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has also delayed a visit to Colombia and called a special cabinet meeting on Sunday to monitor developments.
""We are seeing these intensive efforts and there is more international spotlight on the situation because the life for people here has become increasingly difficult over the years under the siege by Israel, Egypt's blockade and also the sanctions from the Palestinian Authority,"" said Al Jazeera's Stefanie Dekker, reporting from Gaza.
Gaza teen dies of wounds from Israeli border fire
A Gaza teenager died of his wounds on Saturday after being shot by Israeli troops during protests along the border.
The health ministry in the Hamas-run Palestinian territory in a statement identified him as Mohmen al-Hams, 17. He was shot in the chest during protests near the southern Gaza town of Rafah on Friday.
Troops shot dead two other Palestinians during Friday's protests.
Israeli forces kill Palestinian, 12
Majdi Ramzi Kamal al-Satra, a 12-year-old Palestinian, was killed by Israeli army fire, according to health officials in the besieged Gaza Strip.
Ashraf al-Qidra, spokesperson for the health ministry in Gaza, said the boy was killed east of Khan Younis.
His killing raises the number of Palestinians shot dead on Friday to two. Earlier in the day Ghazi Mohammad Abu Mustafa, 43, succumbed to his wounds after being shot in the head.
Al Jazeera's Stefanie Dekker, reporting from the protest site in Gaza, said the Israeli military was also using drones to drop tear gas on demonstrators.
""Israel has been using these drones to drop tear gas further back into the crowd. Closer to the fence, Israeli snipers keep watch and sporadically open fire.""
A female protester told Al Jazeera that the poor living conditions in the besieged enclave were pushing people to go out and demand their rights.
""We are suffering, there is no electricity, no water ... people are going hungry. It's painful, we will keep standing, we will come here to show the whole world we want our rights.""
At least 184 Palestinians were wounded by Israeli forces on Friday, 117 of whom needed hospital treatment, said al-Qidra. Seventy cases involved live bullets. Among the wounded were 14 children and 10 women, as well as four paramedics and one journalist.
A total of 151 Palestinians have been killed since the Great March of Return protests started on March 30.
Al Jazeera's Charles Stratford, reporting from the protests in the Gaza Strip, said that apart of the killing of Ghazi Mohammad Abu Mustafa by Israeli forces, 11 other Palestinians were believed to have been wounded.
Stratford said that Israeli soldiers also used ""a lot of tear gas"" against protesters, with much of it fired from drones.
""The situation is very tense,"" added our correspondent, adding there were growing fears of a further escalation following the recent wave of attacks that hit the besieged enclave.
""What we're seeing here is a standoff between Hamas and the various armed factions in Gaza and the Israelis. Hamas says that these people have every right to continue demonstrating and describe this form of protest using incendiary balloons and kites as being peaceful and they say they have every right to defend the people of Gaza using their weapons.""
Israeli soldiers have shot dead Ghazi Mohammad Abu Mustafa, a 43-year-old Palestinian, near Khan Younis in the Gaza Strip, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health.
Three ambulance volunteers also were injured in the shooting near the fence with Israel.
According to Palestinian news agency Wafa, Mustafa was shot in the head and subsequently taken to a hospital, where he died of his wounds.
The total number of Palestinians killed so far in the ongoing protests since late March is now 150. More than 16,000 others have been wounded.
Half of those suffering wounds were hit by live gunfire, and at least 60 of them have had a limb amputated.
An Israeli air raid in the Gaza Strip killed three Palestinians on Wednesday.
Ahmed al-Bsous, 28, Ubadah Farawneh, 29 and Mohamed al-Aareer, 27, died of their wounds shortly upon arriving at the al-Shifa hospital in Gaza.
The attack came days after a United Nations-brokered ceasefire helped halt an earlier wave of assaults against the Gaza Strip last week.
The ""return to calm"" announced by Hamas in Gaza appears to be holding.
Israeli officials have yet to comment on the ceasefire announced by Hamas earlier in the morning.
Hamas and Israel agreed to a ceasefire early on Saturday, according to a spokesman for the Palestinian group governing the besieged Gaza Strip. ""With international and UN efforts, we reached (an agreement) to return to the previous state of calm between the (Israeli) occupation and the Palestinian factions,"" Hamas spokesman Fawzi Barhoum said in a statement.
Israeli forces have shot dead a Palestinian during the protests in the Gaza Strip near the fence with Israel, raising the number of Palestinians killed on Friday to four.
Israeli soldiers fired live bullets and teargas canisters towards the protesters along the fence, killing Mohammad Sharif Badwan and wounding 120 others, according to health officials in Gaza.
The killing of Badwan, 27, came after Hamas said three of its members were killed earlier in the day in air strikes in the southern part of the Strip.
Later on Friday, the Israeli military said gunfire at the Gaza fence killed an Israeli soldier.
The military said a ""terrorist squad"" fired at troops and one soldier was severely injured and later died of his wounds. He was the first Israeli military fatality in months of violence along the Gaza fence.
The violence raised fears of a new conflict.
""We understand that the Israeli security cabinet has been meeting this afternoon in order to assess whether a large-scale military operation is needed on Gaza,"" said Al Jazeera's Charles Stratford, reporting from the besieged enclave.
""The people of Gaza this evening are very afraid after today's protests and certainly these air strikes that have happened,"" he added.
The Israeli air force has launched a series of air strikes on several places in the Gaza Strip.
The targets, allegedly belonging to Hamas, were attacked as a result of Friday's shooting incidents in which at least one Israeli soldier was wounded.

Israeli soldiers have been put on high alert, the spokesperson for the Israeli army added.
Al Jazeera's Stefanie Dekker, reporting from the protests in Gaza, said tensions were on the rise despite the relatively small crowd that showed up.
""We haven't seen huge numbers of people turn out - yes, there's been a presence, yes the protest took shape the way we have seen over the past 17 weeks but the crowds were smaller,"" Dekker said.
""What makes it more tense is there has been an exchange … of fire between Israel and Hamas, and Israel attacked various Hamas posts,"" she added.
""This all comes amid a very tense political situation. Israel has made it very clear that if Hamas doesn't stop the incendiary balloons and kites across the fence that it will clamp down heavily militarily.
""We haven't seen any incendiary balloons or kites across the fence where we are, but certainly there is a feeling of unease here - there might be behind-the-scenes negotiations going on, but everyone you speak to will tell you that the situation remains very hard to read, whether there is going to be an escalation between the two sides or not,"" Dekker said.
As protests along the fence with Israel entered the 17th straight week, Israel on Friday attacked Hamas positions in the Strip, killing at least three people, according to health officials in Gaza.
""Three Palestinians were martyred by Israeli occupation forces, including two in the northern Gaza Strip and a third in the southern city of Rafah,"" ministry spokesman Ashraf al-Qidra said in a statement.
He did not provide the names or ages of the individuals.
However, the Ezzedine al-Qassam Brigades, the armed wing of Hamas, which has governed the Gaza Strip since 2007, said three of its members had been killed by Israeli air raids and tank fire in Khan Younis and Rafah.
In a statement, the group identified the men as Shaaban Abu Khater, Mohamed Abu Farhana and Mahmoud Qeshta.
The Israeli army said the attacks were in response to shots being fired at their troops along the Gaza fence.
Al Jazeera's Stefanie Dekker, reporting from the protests in Gaza, said tensions were on the rise.
""We've had a couple of incidents today. We've had Israel target three Hamas watchtowers. In the south of Gaza, two Palestinians were killed and one Israeli soldier was injured in what we understand was an exchange of fire in the southern Gaza Strip,"" Dekker said.
""The shooting across the border, the gunfire, the tank shelling - it shows that this is politically not resolved and it could still go any way really.""
Earlier on Friday, Israel's Defence Minister Avigdor Liebermann said that there is a risk of military escalation if incendiary kites and balloons continue to be sent over the fence by protesters.
Those devices have led to the burning of thousands of acres of Israeli land.
""We tried to be sensible and responsible but the heads of Hamas are leading us to a defensive situation, a situation where we would have to go for a wide painful military operation,"" Liebermann said.
An air raid by the Israeli air force killed one Palestinian and wounded three others, in an attack east of Rafah in the southern Gaza Strip, the health ministry said.
A family member said on Thursday that the man killed was working as a border policeman in the Hamas-run enclave. Al Jazeera's Charles Stratford said the 22-year-old was a member of the Qassam Brigades, the armed wing of Hamas.
Israel said one of its aircraft targeted a group launching balloons carrying firebombs over the border fence to burn Israeli farmland.
Israel's fire service says hundreds of fires have burned about 3,000 hectares, causing damage amounting to hundreds of thousands of dollars.
On Wednesday, Israel tightened its blockade on the Gaza Strip, preventing gas and fuel deliveries through its only commercial crossing with the Palestinian besieged enclave a week after Israeli authorities announced the closure of the crossing.
The Kerem Shalom crossing, known to Palestinians as Karem Abu Salem, was shut down on July 9.
Initially, only items deemed as ""humanitarian"" were to be allowed to enter Gaza, such as food, hygiene and medical supplies, fuel, animal feed and livestock.
However, the defence ministry announced late on Monday that fuel and gas deliveries would also be suspended, and that the crossing would remain open only for food and medicine on a case-by-case basis.
Furthermore, the fishing zone, enforced by Israel, in the waters off the Gaza Strip would also be reduced from six nautical miles to three - after it was already reduced last week from 12 nautical miles.
The UN and Gisha, the Legal Centre for Freedom of Movement, called Israel's latest measure an act of ""collective punishment"".
Two teenagers in the Gaza Strip were killed by Israeli air raids on Saturday, according to Palestinian health officials, as Israel carried out the largest daylight attack on the besieged enclave since the 2014 war.
Amir al-Nimra, 15, and Luay Kaheel, 16, died of their wounds on Saturday shortly after an air strike targeted al-Kateeba, an area in western Gaza, the health ministry said.
Twelve others were wounded by the attack.
The al-Kateeba square is adjacent to a park frequently visited by families over the weekend, especially during the summer months
Hamas has condemned an Israeli decision to seal off the Karam Abu Salem commercial border crossing, the primary passageway that transfers necessities to residents of the besieged Gaza Strip.
The group, which governs the enclave, described Monday's measure as a ""crime against the people of Gaza"", blaming the international community's prolonged silence that encourages Israel's blockade on Gaza.
Earlier on Monday, Israel said it will be closing off the Karam Abu Salem border crossing, saying it was in retaliation over Palestinians setting fire to Israeli land.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the decision to shut down the border was taken in coordination with the country's defence minister.
The move, which will come into effect on Tuesday, will only allow for the transfer of humanitarian needs such as cooking gas as well as wheat and flour into Gaza, an official responsible for coordinating the movement of cargo through the border confirmed to Al Jazeera from Gaza.
Health officials in Gaza said two Palestinians have been killed by Israeli fire during demonstrations. Hundreds of other protesters were also wounded.
The victims included 11-year-old Yasser Abu al-Naja who died after sustaining a gunshot wound to the head east of Khan Younis, Ashraf al-Qidra, spokesperson for Gaza's health ministry, said.
Mohammad Fawzi Hamaydeh, 24, was also pronounced dead shortly after being shot by Israeli live fire in the abdomen and foot, east of Rafah in the southern Gaza Strip.
Among the 415 wounded at Friday's demonstration, 11 were children. Three of the injured cases were severe.
Hundreds of mourners marched in Gaza on Saturday at the funeral of a Palestinian man killed by Israeli forces on the 15th consecutive Friday of the Great March of Return.
Ashraf al-Qidra, spokesperson for Gaza's health ministry, said that 22-year-old Mohammad Jamal Abu Halima was killed after being shot in the chest.
He added that 396 others were wounded.
Among them, 13 were children. Fifty-seven were injured from live ammunition.
Ahmed Ziad al-Assi, 21, died on Thursday morning east of the Gaza Strip as a result of wounds inflicted by Israeli forces on June 8, according to Palestinian health officials.
Israeli forces shot al-Assi in the head during the 11th Friday of the Great March of Return protests.
His death takes the number of Palestinians killed by Israeli forces since the protests began to at least 129.
The UN General Assembly will hold an emergency meeting on Wednesday to vote on an Arab-backed resolution on Gaza, the body's president Miroslav Lajcak has announced.
The resolution will condemn Israel, and will be similar to one vetoed by the United States in the Security Council last week, which called for protecting Palestinians from Israeli aggression, according to diplomats.
There are no vetoes in the 193-member world body, but while Security Council resolutions are legally binding, General Assembly resolutions are not.
Health officials in the Gaza Strip say the number of Palestinians killed by Israeli forces during protests near the fence with Israel has risen to four.
Yousef al-Fasih, 29, was shot dead while demonstrating in the eastern Gaza Strip, Palestinian news agency Wafa said.
More than 600 people were wounded by Israeli forces, including photographer Mohammed Abed al-Baba, who was shot in the leg.

Al Jazeera's Imran Khan, reporting from the protests in the Gaza Strip, says Israeli forces are firing teargas at protesters.
""They are using this in two ways, firstly coming in from jeeps ... to try and disperse the [crowd], [and] they are also using teargas drones,"" he said.
""However, the Palestinians have figured out a way of dealing with these drones ... they've figured out that they can entangle a drone into kites, and they have managed to bring down an Israeli drone,"" he added.
Health officials in the Gaza Strip say Israeli forces have killed at least three Palestinians and injured more than 500 during protests near the fence with Israel.
Israeli troops shot and killed 15-year-old Haitham al-Jamal east of Khan Younis, in southern Gaza Strip, Palestinian news agency Wafa said, citing the health ministry.
Ziad Jadallah Bureim was also shot dead while participating in protests in the southern Gaza Strip, while Imad Nabil Abu Darabi, 26, was killed east of Jabalia town in northern Gaza Strip, Wafa added.
Of those injured, 92 protesters sustained live fire wounds, including seven who are critically wounded. Twenty-six children and 14 women are among the wounded.
The remaining injuries were caused by teargas inhalation.

Gaza's health ministry says at least 386 Palestinian protesters near the fence with Israel have been wounded by Israeli forces.
The ministry says five of the wounded were in serious condition.
People are gathering near the border with Israel, defying warnings from the Israeli army.
Reporting from the border, Al Jazeera's Imran Khan said: ""today is Jerusalem day, created by Iranians after the Islamic Revolution in 1979 and that's why people are arriving earlier than they normally would on a Friday to protest at the border"".
Protest organisers have urged people to stay away from the buffer zone to avoid casualties, Khan said.
""If you're a member of Islamic Jihad or Hamas, you're probably likely to listen to the protest organisers and not go towards the buffer zone.
""However if you're just one of these little kids who are flying kites, throwing rocks, you don't have to listen to anybody.
""That's a real fear for many people here, that they won't listen to those instructions not to go near the border, and that's why there may well be casualties,"" Khan said.
The Israeli army has warned people in Gaza not to come close to the border with Israel during Friday's protests, a day when a big turnout is expected.
In a series of tweets issued on Thursday, the Israeli army said they had dropped leaflets in Gaza warning people from approaching the security fence.
Israeli newspaper Haaretz said the leaflets urged people in Gaza ""not to let Hamas turn you into a tool to serve its narrow interests"".
""We urge you not to take part in demonstrations and anarch and not to put yourself in danger,"" the leaflets reportedly said.
The IDF is again warning the people Gaza not to serve as Hamas' tool – as they have been in the violent riots of recent months. The IDF is prepared for a multitude of scenarios & is determined to protect Israeli civilians & sovereignty
Mohammed Naaim Hamada, 30, died on Sunday morning east of the Gaza Strip as a result of wounds inflicted by Israeli forces on May 14, according to Palestinian health officials.
Israeli forces shot Hamada during the Great March of Return protests that coincided with the opening of the US embassy in Jerusalem, and a day before Palestinians marked 70 years since the Nakba, or Catastrophe.
Hamada's death takes the number of Palestinians killed by Israeli forces since the protests began to at least 121.
Razan al-Najjar was killed by Israeli live fire during the protests east of Khan Younis, a city in southern Gaza, according to Palestinian health officials.
The 21-year-old volunteer paramedic died of a gunshot wound to the chest, the Palestinian health ministry said.
A witness said she was shot while running towards the fortified fence to help a casualty.
Wearing a white uniform, ""she raised her hands high in a clear way, but Israeli soldiers fired, and she was hit in the chest"", the witness told Reuters news agency.
Palestinian medical sources say more than 100 other protesters were wounded, 40 of them with live fire.

Al Jazeera's Harry Fawcett, reporting from the rally in Gaza, said the demonstrations ""showed no signs of ending"".
""These protesters have once again been met with live fire from Israeli forces and repeated, very heavy use of tear gas as well,"" he said.
""But how long this is sustainable? It is still seen by many Palestinians here in Gaza as a way of venting their continued desperation with the worsening humanitarian situation.
""The real question though is when the political decision from Hamas will come to end these protests, if it does,"" added Fawcett.
""A senior adviser to the Hamas leadership told Al Jazeera that it is a question of Israel lifting the siege and the blockade. At that point, this strategy of peaceful protests could perhaps change.""
The US will ""unquestionably veto"" a UN draft resolution which calls for ""the consideration of measures to guarantee the safety and protection"" of Palestinian civilians.
US Ambassador Nikki Haley called the Kuwait-sponsored resolution ""grossly one-sided"" and ""morally bankrupt"".
""The resolution calls on Israel to immediately cease its actions in self-defense, but makes no mention of Hamas' aggressive actions against Israeli security forces and civilians,"" she said in a statement.
The draft resolution ""deplores"" and calls for a halt to ""the use of any excessive, disproportionate and indiscriminate force"" by the Israeli military. It also ""deplores the firing of rockets from the Gaza Strip at Israeli civilian areas"".
It asks UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres for a report on a potential ""international protection mechanism"".
A vote on the draft resolution is expected to take place on Friday.
Mouin Abdelhamid al-Saai, a 58-year-old man, died in Gaza's al-Shifa hospital on Saturday, according to Gaza's Ministry of Health.
Israeli forces shot al-Saai on Monday as they fired live ammunition, tear gas and firebombs at protesters during demonstrations that coincided with the opening of the US embassy in Jerusalem.
The protests also came a day before Palestinians marked 70 years since the Nakba, or Catastrophe, the day on which the state of Israel was established on May 15, 1948, in a violent ethnic cleansing campaign.
Mohammed Mazin Alian, a 20-year-old man, also succumbed to his wounds on Saturday after he was shot by Israeli forces on Monday east of the al-Bureij refugee camp in central Gaza.
This brings the total number of Palestinians killed since Monday in Gaza to 64.
The Israeli army has said it launched overnight air raids on Hamas ""infrastructure in military compounds"" and ""weapons production"" facilities in the north of the besieged enclave of Gaza.
The army alleged the ""strikes were conducted in response to the heavy machine gun fire that targeted the city of Sderot"" in the south.
While Hamas has not officially responded to the attacks, a security official from the movement told Anadolu Agency that several of its positions had been targeted.
The Ministry of Health in the Gaza Strip said no one had been injured in the attacks.
The Palestinian envoy to Washington has been recalled to Ramallah in protest over the US relocating its embassy to Jerusalem.
Husam Zomlot was instructed to return by President Mahmoud Abbas, the foreign ministry announced in a statement.
It did not say how long Zomlot would be at headquarters.
Riad al-Malki, the foreign minister, said: ""When they [the US] opened their embassy in Jerusalem there was a need for a decision from our side and this was our decision.""
Israeli border police forces and Palestinian protesters clashed near Jerusalem's Damascus Gate.
Many protesters were removed from the plaza, and others were arrested in the nearby area.
Demonstrators had gathered at the square outside the gate as part of Nakba Day protests.
""The Palestinians have been living here, I was born here, my father, my grandfather, my great great grandfather, I have no other place to go, I don't even have a passport to go anywhere else,"" said Mujid Keluti, a Jerusalem resident.
Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu exchanged heated words on Twitter over Israel's killing of Palestinian protesters in the Gaza Strip.
Netanyahu, in a Twitter post, said Erdogan ""well understands terrorism and slaughter"" because of his support for Hamas, a day after the Turkish leader accused Israel of ""state terror"" and ""genocide"".
Erdogan is among Hamas's biggest supporters and there is no doubt that he well understands terrorism and slaughter. I suggest that he not preach morality to us
Erdogan tweeted back that Netanyahu was the leader of ""an apartheid state that has occupied a defenseless people's lands for 60 years in violation of UN resolutions"", adding that he was criticising Turkey to deflect attention.
""Want a lesson in humanity? Read the 10 commandments"".
Netanyahu is the PM of an apartheid state that has occupied a defenseless people's lands for 60 yrs in violation of UN resolutions. He has the blood of Palestinians on his hands and can't cover up crimes by attacking Turkey. Want a lesson in humanity? Read the 10 commandments.
The row came as the two countries expelled each other's senior diplomats.
Earlier in the day, Turkey told Israel's ambassador to temporarily leave the country, prompting Israel to order the Turkish consul in Jerusalem to leave for an unspecified period, according to the Israeli foreign ministry.
The dispute appears to mark the worst diplomatic crisis between the two regional powers since Israeli marines stormed an aid ship to enforce a naval blockade of Gaza in 2010, killing 10 Turkish activists and prompting a downgrade in diplomatic ties that lasted until 2016.
Marking the 70th anniversary of the Nakba, or the Catastrophe, Hamas leader Ismail Haniya visited protesters east of Gaza City, vowing to continue weeks of protests along Israel's border.
""Our message today is the Return March and siege-breaking is going on and that the massacre the Israeli occupation committed against our revolting and returning youths will only increase our steadfastness, determination and sticking to the right of return,"" said Haniyeh.
""We are coming to tell the whole world: no to the deal of the century and no to the moving of the embassy to Jerusalem and Jerusalem is our eternal capital, the capital of the Palestinian state and Jerusalem's identity will not be changed by a resolution from Trump nor Netanyahu.""
A second Palestinian was killed by Israeli gunfire on Tuesday, the Ministry of Health announced, a day after the Israeli army killed 60 people - the highest death toll in years.
The ministry said the man, who was not named, was killed east of Bureij in central Gaza.
Tuesday's protests were far smaller than the previous day's.
Danny Danon, Israel's ambassador to the UN, has described the longstanding Palestinian demand for the right of return of refugees who fled their homes during the 1948 Arab-Israeli war as a call to destroy Israel.
""Let me be very clear,"" Danon told an emergency session of the UN Security Council. ""When the Palestinians say right of return, they mean destruction of Israel.""
He also accused Hamas of using a strategy of ""orchestrated riots"" and ""planned casualties"" to seek international sympathy.
Hamas activists were using civilians as human shields in the ongoing protests along Gaza's border with Israel, in an attempt to breach the fence and stage attacks on Israel, he added.
Riyad Mansour, Palestine's envoy to the United Nations, accused Israel of committing ""war crimes"" against Palestinian protesters in the Gaza Strip and slammed what he said was the UN Security Council's failure to hold Israel accountable.
""For the past eight weeks, we have begged you to prevent another massacre by Israel, the occupier,"" he told an emergency session of the UN Security Council.
""Is it possible that you did not hear our calls? Is it possible that you did not take our warnings seriously?""
Calling for a transparent and investigation into the killings along the Israel-Gaza border, he said: ""Let us investigate what is happening on the ground. We will accept the outcome of such an investigation.""
The Arab League's Permanent Committee on Human Rights called on the International Criminal Court prosecutor to urgently investigate ""the crimes of the Israeli occupation"" against Palestinians.
""Israel is an oppressive and murderous entity, and its politicians and officers must be taken to the International Criminal Court,"" Amjad Shamout, the committee's chairman, said in a statement.
Arab League chief Ahmed Abul Gheit condemned the ""massacres"" of Palestinians, which he said resemble ""war crimes"".
In a statement, he called on the international community to ""protect the Palestinian people, who have chosen the path of peaceful struggle and have been confronted with brutality, violence and murder"".
The chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court said she was watching closely the unrest in Gaza, and would ""take any action warranted"" to prosecute crimes.
""My staff is vigilantly following developments on the ground and recording any alleged crime that could fall within"" the tribunal's jurisdiction, she warned in a statement to AFP news agency.
""The violence must stop,"" she added.
US ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley tells the Security Council, ""no country in this chamber would act with more restraint than Israel has"".
She said Hamas had been documented by news media as inciting Palestinians to storm the Gaza border.
""The Hamas terrorist organisation has been inciting violence for years, long before the United States decided to move our embassy,"" says Haley.
""This is how determined they are to make the lives of the Palestinian people miserable ... Make no mistake. Hamas is pleased with the results from yesterday.""
Nikolay Mladenov, UN's special coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process, has called on the international community to act quickly and effectively to end the ""senseless violence"" in the Gaza Strip.
""For it to end, it needs every one of us to put in their best effort into preventing an explosion that can drag the whole region into another deadly confrontation,"" he told an emergency session of the UN Security Council.
""The international community must step in and prevent war"", he said.
He called on Israel and Hamas to exercise restraint and to avoid any further escalation, while also urging Israel to investigate any incident that led to the loss of lives.
Belgium demanded a UN inquiry into the violence in Gaza and summoned Israel's ambassador to the foreign ministry after she described all the Palestinian victims as ""terrorists"".
Belgium's foreign ministry said it summoned ambassador Simona Frankel over her remarks while Prime Minister Charles Michel said: ""We call for an international inquiry led by the United Nations.""
French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian described the situation in the Middle East as ""explosive"" and criticised the United States for unilateral acts in the region.
""The situation in the Middle East is explosive, violence is doing the talking, war could loom,"" he told lawmakers in parliament.
Israeli forces killed a Palestinian near the Gaza border on Tuesday, local health officials said.
The 51-year-old man was fatally shot along the frontier in the central Gaza Strip after thousands of Palestinians took part in funerals for Monday's dead.
Palestinian protesters turned out in smaller numbers than on Monday, when dozens were killed by Israeli gunfire.
The UN Security Council is holding an emergency session in New York to discuss violence along the border between Israel and the Gaza Strip.
The meeting began with a minute of silence for the more than 60 people who were killed in Monday's protests.
Speaking before the meeting, Danny Danon, Israeli ambassador to the UN, accused Hamas of attempting to breach the border fence by organising violent protests along the Israel-Gaza border and defended Israel's right to security.
He also accused Hamas of committing 'war crimes' against Palestinian and Israeli civilians.
Turkey's official news agency says the country has asked Israel's ambassador to temporarily leave Turkey.
Anadolu news agency said Tuesday the Turkish foreign ministry notified Eitan Na'eh, the Israeli ambassador that ""it would be appropriate for him to return to his country for some time"".
The ministry summoned the ambassador to protest Israel's use of deadly force on Palestinians and the U.S. decision to relocate its embassy there to contested Jerusalem.
Turkey has also called home its ambassadors to Washington and Tel Aviv for consultations.
Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas called on residents across the occupied West Bank to hold a general strike on Tuesday in honour of those killed in the Gaza Strip on Monday.
Schools, universities, banks, and private and public businesses are closed as part of the strike, which comes as Palestinians commemorate 70 years since the Nakba - or the ""catastrophe"" - when the state of Israel was created, and hundreds of thousands of Palestinians were forced from their towns and villages.
Laila Anwar al-Ghandour, an eight-month-old baby, died of tear gas inhalation at dawn on Tuesday, according to Gaza's ministry of health.
On Tuesday morning, 30-year-old Omar Jumaa Abu Foul succumbed to his wounds from Monday's protests, raising the death toll to 60.
The United Kingdom on Tuesday called for an independent investigation into the violence at the Gaza border with Israel after the United States blocked a United Nations Security Council statement calling for a probe.
Germany also announced its support for an independent inquiry into the deadly violence.
""It is our view that an independent investigation commission can clarify the violent incidents and the bloody violations at the border area,"" said government spokesman Steffan Seibert.
At least 58 Palestinians were killed on Monday in Gaza and more than 2,700 others wounded as the Israeli army fired live ammunition, tear gas and firebombs at protesters assembled along several points near the fence with Israel.
The demonstrations coincided with protests against the opening of the US embassy in Jerusalem.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has accused Israel of ""state terror"" and ""genocide"", according to state-run Anadolu agency, as Ankara announced three days of national mourning over the killing of scores of Palestinians in Gaza.
""Israel is wreaking state terror. Israel is a terror state,"" Erdogan told Turkish students during a visit in Britain's capital, London.
""What Israel has done is a genocide. I condemn this humanitarian drama, the genocide, from whichever side it comes, Israel or America,"" he added.
Thousands had earlier marched through central Istanbul to denounce the bloodshed as the US moved its Israel embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem in defiance of widespread outrage in the Islamic world.
White House spokesman Raj Shah has accused Hamas' leaders of making a ""gruesome and unfortunate propaganda attempt"" after the killing of at least 55 Palestinian protesters by Israeli forces.
Speaking to reporters at a White House briefing, Shah also declined to join with other countries - including France and Britain - in calling for Israel to exercise restraint in its response to the demonstrations.
The White House instead reiterated the Trump administration's refrain that Israel had a right to defend itself.
""The responsibility for these tragic deaths rests squarely with Hamas,"" Shah said. ""Hamas is intentionally and cynically provoking this response.""
Ankara has recalled its ambassadors to Tel Aviv and Washington for consultations, according to Turkish Deputy Prime Minister and government spokesman Bekir Bozdag.
Turkey also called for an emergency meeting of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) this week, said Bozdag, hoping it will be held on Friday.
Turkey has accused the United States of sharing responsibility with Israel for a ""vile massacre"" along the Gaza border.
""The United States, unfortunately, took its place without complaint alongside the Israeli government in this massacre of civilians and became a party to this crime against humanity,"" Prime Minister Binali Yildirim told reporters in Ankara.
""This is a vile massacre, and we condemn it strongly,"" he added.
Yildirim said the events were ""incompatible"" with the US acting as a mediator or protector of world peace.
Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein, the UN high commissioner for human rights, says Israeli live fire killing dozens and wounding hundreds in Gaza must stop immediately.
He also calls on the international community to bring those responsible to justice.
""Shocking killing of dozens, injury of hundreds by Israeli live fire in #Gaza must stop now. The right to life must be respected. Those responsible for outrageous human rights violations must be held to account. The int'l community needs to ensure justice for victims"" – #Zeid. pic.twitter.com/hBb7825Sp8
Palestinian health officials say 55 people have been killed and more than 2,770 others have been wounded so far.
This brings the total death toll since the beginning of the weeks-long protests to 104.
Al Jazeera's Stefanie Dekker, reporting from Gaza City, describes witnessing ""extraordinary scenes"" at the protests along the fence with Israel.
""There was an incredible amount of live fire; it explains the high death toll and the more than 2,000 injured.
""There was tear gas raining down on people and people being shot at, people who were peacefully protesting at the border.""
Dekker says hospitals in the Gaza Strip have now reached ""breaking point"" as medical staff struggle to treat the thousands wounded during the demonstrations.
""Yes the boys, the young men, will tell you that they throw Molotov cocktails and rocks [at the Israeli forces], but they say that is their legitimate right in terms of a resistance to the Israeli occupation.""
""The factions here have all come together to issue a statement saying they all hold Israel responsible for the high death toll,"" she added.
The French presidency has condemned ""the violence"" in Gaza after the killing of 52 Palestinian protesters by Israeli forces.
President Emmanuel Macron ""will speak to all the actors in the region in the coming days"", his office said in a statement.
Kuwait has requested an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council on Tuesday, according to the country's mission to the world body.
""We condemned what has happened,"" Ambassador Mansour al-Otaibi told journalists.
Kuwait is a non-permanent council member.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has responded on Twitter to criticism over the Israeli army's conduct in Gaza, saying it acted in self-defence by firing at protesters.
""The Hamas terrorist organisation declares it intends to destroy Israel and send thousands to breach the border fence in order to achieve this goal,"" Netanyahu wrote.
""We will continue to act with determination to protect our sovereignty and citizens.""
The South African government has condemned the actions of the Israeli armed forces near the fortified fence in Gaza.
In a statement released on Monday, the Department of International Relations (Dirco) says: ""The latest attack has resulted in scores of other Palestinian citizens reported injured, and the wanton destruction of property.""
""Given the indiscriminate and gravity of the latest Israeli attack, the South African government has taken a decision to recall Ambassador Sisa Ngombane with immediate effect until further notice.""
An Israeli drone with a tear gas canister has targeted a group of journalists in Gaza , including an Al Jazeera TV crew.
Al Jazeera correspondent Hoda Abdel-Hamid was standing in a media row with several other reporters when she was hit by the tear gas canister.
Abdel-Hamid has been sent to hospital to be treated for the after-effects of the tear gas.
Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has described the events in Gaza as ""one of the most ferocious days"" during a press conference.
He also told a press conference that the move of the US embassy to Jerusalem was an assault on the sovereignty of the Palestinian people.
""On this day, the Israeli massacres against our people continue in the Gaza Strip as well as the West Bank. Today is one of the most ferocious days that our people have witnessed,"" said Abbas.
""As we speak, about 52 Palestinians have been killed, a number which is likely to increase. This is an indication of the level of Israeli brutality.""
""Today Israel is celebrating the opening of the US embassy. They allege that the occupied land of Jerusalem is the land of their forefathers. That is a falsification of history.
""Palestinians have been living continuously on this land. Our people will not give up their peaceful demonstrations until we reach victory with Jerusalem as our capital.
""By this move [of the embassy] the US has excluded itself from the peace process in the Middle East. It can no longer act as mediator, and its role will no longer be valid.""
Riyad Mansour, the Palestinian Authority's UN ambassador, has condemned Israeli strikes on unarmed Palestinians in Gaza.
Speaking at a press conference in New York, Mansour described Washington's decision to open its embassy in Jerusalem as ""very tragic"".
""We will use all of our available rights in the security council to see it shouldering its responsibility to condemn this massacre and bring those responsible to justice,"" said Mansour.
""Very tragic that they (America) are celebrating illegal action while Israel is injuring and killing thousands of Palestinians.
""Tragic day for Palestinians and shame on those who ignore the pain and suffering of the Palestinian people.""
The Palestinian Ministry of Health has put out a call on Twitter for people in Gaza to head to donation centres to donate their blood.

British Prime Minister Theresa May's spokesman urged ""calm and restraint"" in the Gaza Strip ahead of the opening of the US embassy in Jerusalem.
Foreign Office minister Alistair Burt also expressed concern that peaceful protests were being exploited by extremist elements while adding: ""(I) urge restraint in use of live fire.""
The prime minister's spokesman said: ""We are concerned by the reports of violence and loss of life in Gaza. We urge calm and restraint to avoid actions destructive to peace efforts.
""The prime minister had made her views clear in December that we disagreed with the decision (to move the US embassy). We believe it's unhelpful in terms of prospects for peace in the region.""
The spokesman also reiterated Britain's commitment to a two-state solution between the Israelis and Palestinians with Jerusalem as the shared capital.
Palestinian health officials say 43 people have been killed and 1,960 others have been wounded so far.
Of those killed, the Ministry of Health says at least six are below 18, including one female. Of those wounded, at least 200 are below the age of 18; seventy-eight are women, and 11 are journalists.
According to the ministry, some 918 people were shot at with live ammunition.
At least 39 are in critical condition, and there are fears that the death toll could rise.
""The hospital smells like blood, there is blood everywhere,"" local journalist Maram Humaid told Al Jazeera from the Indonesia Hospital in the northern Gaza Strip.
""Those wounded are lying on the floor - there are no more beds to accommodate them. The hospitals are overflowing,"" Humaid added.
""There is a state of anxiety in the hospitals. Ambulances have not stopped arriving. The refrigerators are filling up with bodies and hundreds of people are crowded near them, distressed by the news of the killing of their loved ones.""
Egypt and Jordan have condemned Israeli action in the Gaza Strip, where dozens of Palestinians have been killed by Israeli fire at the border.
Jordan's government spokesman, Mohammed al-Momani, condemned Israel's use of ""excessive force against the defenceless Palestinian people"" and described the violence as a ""crime"".
Egypt meanwhile ""expressed its strong condemnation for the targeting of unarmed Palestinian civilians by the Israeli occupation forces"", according to a foreign ministry statement.
Egypt and Jordan are the only two Arab states with formal diplomatic relations with Israel. Cairo signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1979 and Jordan followed in 1994.
Organisers of the Great March of Return say they are expecting as many as one million people to join the demonstration and attempt to cross the fence with Israel at various points along the border.
A leaflet circulated by the organisers reads: ""The national committee for the Great March of Return invites you to participate in the peaceful popular protest, the Million Man March of Return and Breaking the Siege"".
A spokesperson for the Great March of Return, Ahmad Abu Artema, told Al Jazeera that the goal of trying to cross the fence is to ""send a message the Palestinian people have not and will not adapt to 70 years of being refugees, estrangement and difficult conditions.""
""We are adamant to return, no matter what happens. This is what the people of Gaza want - it's about popular will. And this is their right.""
The Right of Return is enshrined in United Nations Resolution 194.
Israeli officials have accused Hamas of being behind the protests, saying the movement exploits Palestinians and deliberately exposes them to danger near the border fence.
The organisers behind the Great March of Return have rejected these claims.
Early on Monday, the Israeli military, which has imposed a land, sea and air blockade on the Gaza Strip for more than a decade, dropped leaflets warning Palestinians to stay away from the border.
Jamal Afanah, a 15-year-old boy, died on Saturday in the southern Gaza Strip as a result of wounds inflicted by Israeli security forces the day before, according to Palestinian health officials.
Israeli forces shot Afanah on Friday during protests which took place for the seventh Friday in a row as part of the Great March of Return movement.
Afanah's death takes the number of Palestinians killed by Israeli forces since the protests began to at least 49.
The Palestinian embassy in Cairo announced that Egypt would open the Rafah border crossing for four days and would allow movement in both directions.
The opening is meant to attend to humanitarian cases, as well as to those whose names are registered waiting to leave the Gaza Strip.
Hundreds of Palestinians in the southern Gaza Strip attended the funeral of 40-year-old Jaber Salem Abu Mustafa, who was shot by Israeli forces.
Mustafa was shot in the chest near the Israeli border, east of Khan Younis, on Friday, May 11.
Israeli forces have shot dead a 40-year-old man, Jaber Salem Abu Mustafa, east of Khan Younis, according to Palestinian health officials.
Abu Mustafa died when he was shot in the chest with live ammunition.
Ashraf al-Qidra, spokesperson for Gaza's health ministry, said 167 other people had been wounded by live ammunition, tear gas, and rubber-coated steel bullets.
One journalist was among those injured. He sustained an injury in his foot east of Khan Younis.
Al-Qidra said medical staff are conducting therapeutic treatment for dozens wounded by Israeli forces, including women and children.
Al Jazeera's Stefanie Dekker, reporting from the Gaza-Israel border, said young people have been arriving at the protests with tyres to be burned to reduce their visibility to Israeli forces positioned with snipers on the other side of the fence.
""We've already seen one youth injured this morning, hit by live fire. He was very close to the fence, taken away in an ambulance,"" Dekker said.
""What people here will tell you is that there is a lot of pressure. It has resulted in a lot of pressure on Israel.
""We're understanding from sources that there are talks under the table to prevent the Nakba protest from happening. Why? Because hundreds of thousands of people are expected to show up - not just at this point but all along the border with Israel.""
Dekker explained that there might be fewer demonstrators attending this Friday's protests compared with previous weeks because Palestinians are preparing for far bigger protests in the days to come.
Around noon, some 50 Israelis began marching towards the Gaza border protesting against the Israeli blockade on the Gaza Strip and the Israeli army's use of lethal force against unarmed Palestinian protesters.
Israeli forces have fired tear gas and live rounds at Palestinian protesters on the Gaza-Israel border, wounding at least 40 people.
At least 13 people were wounded by live fire, according to the health ministry in Gaza.
Al Jazeera's Harry Fawcett, reporting from the Gaza-Israel border, said there were no reports of deaths and that the number of people injured on Friday marked ""a substantial decrease"" as compared to previous weeks.
But that figure could rise, he said, adding: ""We have heard live fire being used on several occasions today. There has been a lot of tear gas, a lot of warnings coming from the Israeli side.""
Protesters burned tyres at the site sending black smoke billowing into the air.
These are the 56 Palestinians that have been killed by Israel since the start of the protests:
In two separate incidents, Israeli forces shot dead three Palestinians at the Gaza-Israel border fence late Sunday evening. The spokesperson for the Israeli army confirmed the deaths on Twitter and added that another Palestinian had been detained.
Azzam Oweida, a 15-year old boy, who was shot in the head by Israeli military on Friday has died of his wounds on Saturday.
Hundreds in Khan Younis gathered to pay their last respects for Hillal on Saturday.
Three other Palestinians were shot dead during Friday's peaceful protests.
Four Palestinian demonstrators were killed and 955 injured by Israeli forces during the protests on Friday.
The health ministry identified the three men and child as Khalil Atallah, 22, Muhammad Amin al-Muqid, 21, Abd al-Salam Eid Zuhdi Baker, 33, and Azzam Oweida, 15.
""Thousands of people stood right at the border, then we heard Israeli forces opening live fire. They're still doing that sporadically as we speak,"" Al Jazeera's Stefanie Dekker reported from the Israel-Gaza border.
""Ambulances are rushing towards that area... The scenes that we have witnessed here over the past half hour or so are the most dramatic.""
Eighteen medical personnel and journalists were among the wounded.
Ashraf al-Qidra, spokesperson for Gaza's health ministry, said Israeli forces targeted medical service points twice with an unidentified gas east of the al-Bureij refugee camp in central Gaza.
A number of victims experienced convulsions as a result of their exposure, he said.

At least 25 Palestinian protesters have reportedly been injured by live Israeli gunfire or have suffocated from tear gas inhalation, as demonstrations erupted for the fifth Friday in a row in Gaza, according to reports.
The Palestinian news agency WAFA reported that at least six Palestinians were injured when Israeli forces fired live ammunition at protesters, while the rest were hurt because of teargas inhalation.
Hundreds of protesters have been gathering at the eastern and northern borders of the Gaza Strip on what they called the ""Friday of Rebellious Youth"".
UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein has condemned Israel's use of ""excessive force"" against Palestinian protesters, saying its security forces must be held to account for the many deaths and injuries sustained by Palestinians in the past month.
""The loss of life is deplorable, and the staggering number of injuries caused by live ammunition only confirms the sense that excessive force has been used against demonstrators - not once, not twice, but repeatedly,"" Zeid said.
In the past four weeks, 42 Palestinians were killed and more than 5,500 injured along the fence in Gaza, with no reports of Israeli casualties.
Palestinian officials say the death toll on Friday has risen to four, with Mohammed Ibrahim Ayyoub, a 15-year-old from Jabalia in the northern Gaza Strip, joining the growing list of fatalities.
Ashraf al-Qidra, spokesperson for Gaza's health ministry, added that at least 729 Palestinians, including 45 children, had been wounded by Israeli forces.
The other three victims were identified as Ahmed Rashad, 24, Ahmed Abu Aqil, 25, and Saad Abdul Majid Abdul-Aal Abu Taha, 29.
Yahya Sinwar, the leader of Hamas in the Gaza Strip, has made a rare public appearance at a protest near Gaza City.
Freed in a 2011 prisoner swap with Israel after more than 20 years in jail, Sinwar told the crowd of protesters that they would ""march on Jerusalem"".
Asaad Abu Shariek, a spokesman for the Great March of Return protest movement, said demonstrators were following a path laid down by South Africa during its struggle against apartheid.
""People are very enthusiastic to come and take part in the protests because they know without participating in this non-violent form of resistance they can't achieve their objective,"" Abu Shariek told Al Jazeera.
When asked whether the protests would lead to any tangible concessions by the Israelis, Abu Shariek said: ""We are implanting an idea in the minds of people across the world that Palestinians have rights and they hope for the right of return.
""We want the world to impose a military embargo on Israel and the BDS [Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions] strategy. South Africa used this method, and they emerged victorious, and I think we will be no exception.""
'Barrage of tear gas'
Reporting from the protest site, Al Jazeera's Bernard Smith said the thousands of Palestinians in attendance were being subjected to a ""barrage of tear gas from Israeli soldiers"".
""Thick black smoke has now filled the air as they try to obscure the view for Israeli soldiers,"" Smith said.
""This is a peaceful protest as it has been over the last few weeks.
""There will be more protests like this until May 15, the day the Palestinians call the Nakba that marked the founding of the state of Israel.""
Ahmed Rashad, 24, was pronounced dead by the Palestinian Ministry of Health after being hit by a live bullet fired by Israeli forces. This brings the death toll to 37 Palestinians since protests began on March 30.
Ahmed Abu Akil, 25, died in the hospital after being shot with a live bullet, according to the Palestinian health ministry.
Palestinian protesters along the Gaza border have sent kites over the fence into Israel, including some carrying notes telling Israelis: ""There is no place for you in Palestine.""
At least 40 Palestinians have been wounded by Israeli use of live fire and tear gas during protests along the Gaza-Israeli border, reported by the Palestinian Ministry of Health.
Among the wounded is Ahmed Abu Akil from Jabaliya. He has been moved to the intensive care unit after being injured in the head by live bullets fired by the Israeli forces, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health.
Another two Palestinians have also been reported injured in the Gaza Strip after Israeli forces fired live bullets at protesters.
Israel dropped leaflets in the Gaza Strip warning Palestinians not to approach its border fence as the military braced for fresh Palestinian protests along the eastern borders of the Gaza Strip.
It was the first time leaflets have been dropped in the recent round of demonstrations.
The Israeli army ""is prepared for all scenarios. Stay away from the fence and do not attempt to harm it,"" read the leaflets, which were scattered by Israeli aircraft along the border in the early morning.
The Palestinian Ministry of Health is reporting that a total of 969 people have been injured by Israeli forces

The spokesperson for Gaza's health ministry Ashraf al-Qidra had condemned Israeli forces targeting a mobile clinic east of Khan Younis with tear gas, resulting in the suffocation of 10 medical staff.
""Despite the direct targeting of our medical points, we are determined to continue providing treatment to our people under all circumstances,"" he said.
The Ministry of Health also said that 30 protesters have been injured so far.
Al Jazeera's Harry Fawcett said that three protesters east of Gaza City have already been wounded by Israeli forces.
""What we have seen over the past two Fridays is a great number of people shot by Israeli snipers,"" he said, speaking near the encampment near Gaza City.
According to Gaza's Ministry of Health, more than 1,600 Palestinians were wounded last Friday.
Last Friday, nine journalists who were covering the protests were hospitalised with serious leg injuries after Israeli forces shot at them.
One them, Izz Abu Shanab, is a freelance photographer and told Al Jazeera he was wearing a flak jacket marked with ""PRESS"" and a helmet.
""As I was working about 400 metres away from the border fence, the Israelis shot me with a live bullet in the leg,"" Abu Shanab said. ""It broke the bone because it was an explosive bullet.""
Another journalist, Jameel Dahlan, said that despite concern from family members, he will continue to cover the protests.
""We as journalists send a message,"" he told Al Jazeera. ""No matter what my wife or mother says, we love our work. Because of that we'll keep coming here.""
Amer Shreiteh, member of the Coordinating Committee for the Return March, told local Palestinian media that Friday's protest theme has been dubbed as ""Burn the Israeli flag and raise the Palestinian one"".
""A 25-metre flag mast has been built for each of the five encampments along the border,"" he said.
In a statement, the Committee confirmed its commitment to a peaceful, popular protest.
For a second week, thousands of Palestinians protested along the eastern borders of the Gaza Strip, as part of the Great March of Return movement.
Israeli forces have killed 29 Palestinians during the past week, including 21 during and after the March 30 protests, which wounded more than 1,600 others.
Eight Palestinians died last Friday, including one who succumbed to his wounds after being shot last week.
Two more died from their wounds the following day, including journalist Yaser Murtaja.

Freed in a 2011 prisoner swap with Israel after more than 20 years in jail, Sinwar told the crowd that Gaza would ""stand tall"" in the face of Israeli occupation.
""The plot of starvation and siege have failed to incite the Palestinian people against the resistance [Hamas].
""Gaza will not starve and will not abandon its national objective.
""Our people came out to tell the world that Gaza is free and that we will stand tall and resist the Israeli occupation.""

Salem witnessed his colleague Yaser Murtaja, a 30-year-old journalist with a local media outlet, drop to the ground after he was shot by Israeli forces in the stomach.
""Yaser was filming with his camera next to me when we heard the sound of gunfire,"" Salem said. ""He just fell on the ground and said, 'I've been shot, I've been shot'.""

Half an hour ago the occupation army shot my brother, journalist, Ibrahim Zanoun in the arm!
The Palestinian Ministry of Health says protester Majdi Ramadan Shbat has been killed east of Gaza City by Israeli forces.
The number of those wounded has risen to at least 250, according to the ministry.
Shbat's death brings the total number of protesters killed on Friday to three, after Thaer Rab'a, who was shot by Israeli forces during the March 30 demonstrations, succumbed to his wounds earlier in the day.
Al Jazeera's Hoda Abdel-Hamid, reporting from Gaza, says Palestinian protesters have remained ""defiant"" despite Israel saying it will not change its rule of engagement.
""Some young boys have been carrying mirrors to blind the soldiers stationed all along the border,"" she said. ""We've seen them with makeshift homemade gas masks which won't really protect them from anything.
""Tension is growing because more and more people are arriving, but it seems that the Israelis are showing some degree of restraint compared to last week,"" she continued. ""They are still using live ammunition and high-velocity bullets which don't kill but maim protesters.""
The Palestinian Ministry of Health has confirmed that 38-year-old Osama Qdeih has been killed by Israeli live fire east of Khan Younis.
The number of wounded has increased to at least 150, the ministry added.

According to Ashraf al-Qidra, the health ministry's spokesperson, five are in critical condition after being shot in the head or in the upper body.
Mahjoob Zweiri, a professor at Qatar University, told Al Jazeera that the protests are the outcome of ""years and years of frustration"" by the residents of the Gaza Strip.
""If you look at the past 60 years there has always been delayed action from the Arab League and the international community [with regards to] the Palestinian question,"" he said.
""That delay of action is an indication that there is no serious attempt to stop Israel from doing what it is doing now.""
UN High Commissioner for Human Rights spokeswoman Liz Throssell has expressed concern over further violence during Friday's demonstrations and in the weeks ahead.
Speaking at a press conference in Geneva, Throssell said: ""We remind Israel of its obligations to ensure that excessive force is not employed against protesters and that in the context of a military occupation, as is the case in Gaza, the unjustified and unlawful recourse to firearms by law enforcement resulting in death may amount to a willful killing, a grave breach of the Fourth Geneva Convention.""
Earlier, Gaza's Ministry of Health confirmed the death of Thaer Rab'a, 30, who succumbed to his injuries after he was shot by Israeli forces last Friday.
This brings this week's death toll to 22 Palestinians.
Palestinians have gathered hundreds of spare tyres and plan on setting them on fire in order to create a smokescreen to obstruct the vision of Israeli snipers.
Al Jazeera's correspondent in the Gaza Strip, Hoda Abdel-Hamid, said that the situation is calm at the moment, despite five Palestinians so far being wounded by live ammunition
""[At the five encampments along the border] you have entire families with their children dressed in traditional Palestinian clothes,"" she said. ""They are having picnics, they are sitting on the floor, and there's a lot of vendors on the side.
""It is a completely different atmosphere and that's where the vast majority of people are.""
On Thursday night, the internal security of Hamas released a statement calling on all protesters to ""avoid friction with the Israeli occupation forces, and cooperate with the instructions of the organizers of the events.""
The statement also called on participants to avoid wearing distinctive clothes and to not take photos or use their mobile phones.
""The march is organised by refugees, doctors, lawyers, university students, Palestinian intellectuals, academics, civil society organizations and Palestinian families,"" Asad Abu Sharekh, the spokesperson of the march, told Al Jazeera.
""Using these claims of Hamas being behind the protests, Israel is trying to sabotage the idea of the march to justify its escalation against protesters.""
The planned protests, which started on March 30, or Land Day, will continue until the Nakba anniversary on May 15, which marks 70 years since 750,000 Palestinians were expelled from their villages and towns by Zionist militias in 1948.
Makeshift tents have been erected 700 metres away from the Israeli fence, symbolising the right of return for Palestinian refugees, who make up 70 percent of the Gaza Strip's population of two million.

The 64-year-old confirmed on Monday that she will continue her fourth and last term as chancellor until the 2021 polls, after which she would not contest for political positions.
""Firstly, at the next CDU party conference in December in Hamburg, I will not put myself forward again as candidate for the CDU chair,"" she told reporters at her party headquarters in the capital, Berlin.
""Secondly, this fourth term is my last as German chancellor. At the federal election in 2021, I will not stand again as chancellor candidate, nor as a candidate for the Bundestag [federal parliament] and ... I won't seek any further political offices,"" Merkel added.
The chancellor also said that she would not run for office should a snap election be held before 2021.
""Today it is time to begin a new chapter,"" said Merkel, who revealed that she had made the decision to resign before the German parliament's summer recess and had planned to announce it on the first week of November.
The developments come as her party and governing coalition partner, the centre-left Social Democrats (SPD), have been losing national support.
The CDU came first but bled support in a vote in the western state of Hesse on Sunday, the second electoral setback in as many weeks for Merkel's conservative alliance.
Both parties also suffered heavy losses in the southeastern state of Bavaria earlier this month.
Standing down from the party chair would allow a new CDU chairperson to build a profile before the next national election, due in 2021.
Merkel's favoured successor is thought to be party Secretary-General Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, who, along with Health Minister Jens Spahn, announced her candidacy on Monday, Merkel confirmed.
However, the chancellor refused to back either candidate, saying she would not try to influence talks on who replaces her as party leader.
Merkel and her party have faced a growing backlash from Germany's far right over migration and refugee policies that allowed hundreds of thousands of refugees to enter the country.
The Christian Social Union (CSU), Merkel's Bavarian allies, have given her an ultimatum to improve results or they will pull the plug on the partnership.
Matthew Qvortrup, Merkel's biographer, believes Merkel is stepping down as the party leader before she could be pushed out because of the ""massive losses"".
""She's resigning mainly because it's becoming almost untenable for her to stay on,"" he told Al Jazeera in an interview from Berlin. ""She had to do something and this is the next card she can play.""
""She's still relatively popular in the country as a whole - about almost 50 percent actually support her policies and support her - but internally in the CDU party, she needed to do something.""
Merkel's weakness at home may limit her capacity to lead in the European Union at a time when the bloc is dealing with Britain's departure from it, or Brexit, a budget crisis in Italy and the prospect of populist parties making gains in European Parliament elections next May.
She told reporters on Monday that Brexit and US-Russia tensions would continue to be her main focus for the remainder of her chancellorship and that not much would change on Eurozone issues as the German parliament will have to approve any major decisions.

Wendell Hissrich, the city's public safety director, said Saturday's suspected attacker was at a hospital in fair condition with multiple gunshot wounds.
FBI special agent Bob Jones said the attacker used an assault rifle and three handguns inside the Tree of Life Synagogue in the Squirrel Hill neighbourhood.
The attacker was leaving when he met an officer, Jones said.
Local television station KDKA said the suspect in custody was a ""white male"". A law enforcement official, who spoke to The Associated Press news agency on condition of anonymity, identified the detainee as Robert Bowers, a man in his 40s.
An earlier social media post by Bowers said: ""[A Jewish refugee organisation, the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society] likes to bring invaders in that kill our people. I can't sit by and watch my people get slaughtered. Screw your optics, I'm going in.""
The comment was posted on Gab, a Philadelphia, Pennsylvania-based social networking service created as an alternative to Twitter.
Bowers also recently posted a photo of a collection of three semi-automatic handguns he titled ""my glock family,"" a reference to the firearms manufacturer.
He also posted photos of bullet holes in person-sized targets at a firing range, touting the ""amazing trigger"" on a handgun he was offering for sale.
In a statement, Gab.com confirmed the profile belonged to Bowers.
""Gab took swift and proactive action to contact law enforcement immediately,"" it said.
""We first backed up all user data from the account and then proceeded to suspend the account. We then contacted the FBI and made them aware of this account and the user data in our possession.""
Al Jazeera's John Hendren, reporting from Washington, DC, said the shots began at about 10am local time as worshipers were gathering for Sabbath (Saturday) services.
""There were perhaps 60 to 100 people inside there,"" he said.
The Tree of Life synagogue describes itself on its website as a traditional, progressive and egalitarian congregation. Few other details were immediately available.
The tree-lined residential neighbourhood of Squirrel Hill close to the city centre is the hub of Pittsburgh's Jewish community.
Local TV news footage showed police at that location with rifles and wearing helmets and other tactical gear.
Paramedics also were stationed near the synagogue and police vehicles were blocking some streets in the area.
US President Donald Trump took to Twitter to say he was watching events in Pittsburgh: ""Looks like multiple fatalities. Beware of active shooter. God bless all!""
Later, he told reporters: ""It's a terrible, terrible thing what's going on with hate in our country frankly, and all over the world. Something has to be done. When people do this, they should get the death penalty.""
Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf called the shooting an ""absolute tragedy"".
""We must all pray and hope for no more loss of life,"" Wolf said. ""But we have been saying 'this one is too many' for far too long. Dangerous weapons are putting our citizens in harm's way.""
Saturday's shooting incident is the latest in the United States, where firearms are linked to more than 30,000 deaths annually.

Bowers is a resident of Baldwin, a borough south of Pittsburgh.
He was a user of Gab, a social media site that promotes itself as a bastion of free speech but has become popular with white nationalists, many of whom were blocked by other social media.
According to screenshots of Bower's Gab account, from where most information concerning the alleged synagogue shooter comes, he often wrote anti-Semitic posts.
Bowers' profile description quotes a Bible verse, John 8:44, in which Christ says that members of the Jewish community speaking out against him ""belong to their father,"" or the Devil.
Most biblical scholars believe Christ meant the members of the Jewish community were following Satan's desire to stop a man from speaking the truth.
Suspect in the shooting is Robert Bowers. This is what he posted on Gab, and Gab is now conveniently down. pic.twitter.com/JqFw4fAGuS
The profile simply states: ""jews [sic] are the children of satan [sic].""
Bowers appears to have associated the US Jewish community with bringing in refugees, a common target of the global far-right.
""[A Jewish refugee organisation, the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society] likes to bring invaders in that kill our people. I can't sit by and watch my people get slaughtered. Screw your optics, I'm going in,"" he wrote.
Bowers also posted an image of three pistols. The alleged attacker was reportedly armed with an AR-15 assault rifle and three handguns when he attacked the synagogue.
The alleged assailant also posted images of three pistols that he called his Glock ""family"".
Post on gab from the shooter, he could have used one of these. pic.twitter.com/CwhLfueetw
FBI Agent Bob Jones said Bowers was not known to law enforcement before the attack and it is currently believed the suspect was acting alone, the Associated Press news agency reported.
Federal authorities have charged Bowers with 29 criminal counts including violence, 11 counts of use of a firearm to commit murder and four counts of obstruction of exercise of religious beliefs resulting in bodily injury to a safety officer and death, which are hate crimes.
""The crimes of violence are based upon the federal civil rights laws prohibiting hate crimes,"" US Attorney Scott W. Brady and Bob Jones, FBI special agent in charge of Pittsburgh office, said in a statement.
If Bowers is convicted of a hate crime he could face the death penalty.
""Today 11 innocent people were suddenly and viciously murdered during religious services,"" said Attorney General Jeff Sessions in a statement Saturday. ""These alleged crimes are reprehensible and utterly repugnant to the values of this nation.""
Hate crimes charges are separate from domestic violence charges under US law.
Most people who face ""terrorism"" charges in the US are accused to have provided material support to foreign groups designated as ""terrorist"" organisations by the US government, according to a report by the Center on Law and Security.
The US Constitution affords protection on speech and assembly in the First Amendment, making it difficult - though not impossible - to charge US citizens with terror-related offences that do not involve international actors.
US President Donald Trump has said its ""incredible"" that an anti-Semitic attack could take place.
Trump has faced criticism over his use of divisive rhetoric and support from far-right figures.
A recent string of mail bombs sent to Trump's critics and Democrats, allegedly by suspect Cesar Sayoc, has intensified concern over the president's rhetoric.
The president was quick to say that Bowers was not one of his supporters.
Bowers also posted anti-Trump rhetoric, calling him a ""globalist"" and not a ""nationalist"", which Trump recently claimed to be. Bowers used an anti-Semitic slur to say that as long as there Jewish people in the US, the country would never be great.
robert bowers is a typical paul nehlen supporter, this is ultimately what special agent nehlen wanted his supporters to do. he was never a political candidate but a fed plant used to MKultra spergs and mentally disabled people, it worked. pic.twitter.com/Btr1lWQTZl
Hate crimes have increased under the Trump administration. The Anti-Defamation League, a Jewish NGO that tracks anti-Semitism, found that anti-Semitic incidents in the US rose 57 percent in 2017.
It found 1,986 cases of harassment, vandalism or physical assault against Jews and Jewish institutions last year.

Saturday's meeting in Istanbul was aimed at laying the groundwork for an eventual peace plan in a country devastated by more than seven years of war.
In a joint communique following their meeting, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Emmanuel Macron and Russian President Vladimir Putin called for ""an inclusive, Syrian-led and Syrian-owned political process"" and said conditions needed to be created for the safe and voluntary return of refugees.
The summit, which was not attended by any Syrian groups, was the first to bring the four leaders together.
Erdogan said the constitutional committee, which was first agreed upon in January during Russian-sponsored talks at the Black Sea resort of Sochi needed to convene ""as soon as possible"".
However, efforts to bring Syria's warring factions together to draft a new constitution under which elections would be held have stalled, with the committee failing to meet even once.
Syria's major opposition groups had boycotted the Sochi event, officially known as Syrian Congress of National Dialogue, and rejected the constitutional plan. The fate of President Bashar al-Assad, a major sticking point that has repeatedly caused negotiations to fail, had not been mentioned in the final statement of the Sochi summit.
""The people of Syria will determine the future of President Bashar al-Assad,"" said Erdogan, whose administration backs certain rebel groups in Idlib.
""As far as we are concerned, Assad is someone who has killed nearly one million of his citizens. He is not someone who we hold in high esteem. Massacres continue as before, but it is our wish that this process comes to an end and the people of Syria can begin to live their lives again.""
Since the beginning of the Syrian uprising, hundreds of thousands of Syrians have been killed and over 12 million people - half the country's prewar population - have been displaced.
Erdogan said while Turkey had welcomed more than three million Syrian refugees, ""they should be allowed to return to Syria, and this should be done in a voluntary fashion.
""With the cooperation of the United Nations, this can and should be done,"" he said.
Also discussed at the summit was a demilitarised zone around the densely-populated Idlib province, a Turkish- and Russian- backed initiative aimed at preventing a large-scale military assault on the last rebel enclave in Syria.
Al Jazeera's Zeina Khodr, reporting from Istanbul, said France and Germany were attending the summit because they want the situation in Idlib to ""remain quiet"" and ""do not want an offensive that will create a humanitarian catastrophe and a new wave of refugees reaching Europe"".
""France and Germany are in attendance on the basis that there will not be a Syrian government offensive on Idlib,"" said Khodr.
""Meanwhile, Russia and Turkey want Europe on board to help pay for Syria's reconstruction.
""They do not believe the West should wait for a political solution agreed by all those involved in the crisis before reconstruction work begins.
""But Europe and the US don't see it that way.
""What is also significant about this summit is that France is trying to mediate between the Russian and the Americans - what we're hearing is that Macron is trying to set-up a high-level meeting in Paris. At the end of the day, you're going to need the US on board if you want to reach an internationally backed-deal to end the war.""
Putin, a major backer of Assad, called the 15-20km zone ""a temporary measure"", adding that he hoped ""the Turkish government will ensure, in the near future, the complete withdrawal of the [armed] opposition from the zone and heavy artillery"".
On Friday, Syria's UN envoy Bashar al-Jaafari also called that the buffer zone ""temporary"", adding that Idlib would eventually revert to government control.
An estimated three million Syrians live in Idlib, half of them already displaced from cities and towns under state control.
Putin added that Moscow reserved the right to help Damascus ""eliminate terrorists"" in Idlib in the event of any provocations.
According to an agreement brokered between Ankara and Moscow last month, opposition groups are to remain in areas where they are already present in Idlib, while Russian and Turkish forces will carry out joint patrols in the area with a view to preventing a resumption of fighting.
For her part, Merkel renewed a call for elections and said ""all Syrians must be allowed to decide the country's future, in free, transparent elections which must be supervised internationally"".
Meanwhile, Macron called on Russia to exercise ""very clear pressure"" on Damascus ""which depends on it for survival"".
A final statement from the four leaders also rejected ""separatist agendas aimed at undermining the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Syria as well as the national security of neighbouring countries"".
Al Jazeera's Zeina Khodr, reporting from Istanbul, said ""there was little consensus"" among the Istanbul summit attendees, adding that ""the differences of opinion were out in the open"".
""France attended the Istanbul summit because they wanted to get a guarantee and a commitment from Turkey and Russia that the Idlib deal to create a demilitarised zone will become a lasting ceasefire.
""But we know that Russia and Turkey wanted a commitment from Europe to help pay with the reconstruction of Syria - and Russia and Turkey did not get that from the Europeans.""
""So, the different players are still so far apart and yet we heard all of them say there is a need to get other players on board.""
Joshua Landis, director of the Center for Middle East studies at the University of Oklahoma, described the Istanbul summit as ""a big departure"" from the United Nations-backed Geneva process and ""a vote of no-confidence to the US"".
Speaking to Al Jazeera, he said ""the big gain"" for Erdogan is getting ""Europe involved into the Astana process"", referring to a separate diplomatic track led by Turkey, Russia and Iran in Kazakhstan's capital.
""Erdogan wants to counterbalance Russia with some German and French muscle to stabilise the Idlib situation and make sure that Russia and Syria don’t invade and drive all these rebels and jihadists into Turkey, as well many more Syrian refugees which would be a disaster for Turkey and very bad for Europe.""
Commenting on the talk about constitutional reform and ""free and fair elections"", Landis said ""that is not going to happen"".
""Assad won this war and of course this is a fig leave being brought by Europe - and of course the US behind it - and Turkey, saying that somehow we are going to get the opposition in power in Damascus,"" Landis said.
""Assad fought this war brutally in order to stop that and Russia sided with him. I don't think that these peace negotiations are going to end up winning the war that the militaries could not do in the country.
""But there are many issues, including what is going to happen to all those rebel fighters in Idlib? Are they going to be destroyed and arrested or are they going to own a country, a little enclave, protected by Turkey and Europe?""

In Saturday's meeting, Ankara is expected to press for a clear outline of steps towards a political resolution, as well as for the preservation of a deal reached in September with Moscow that set up a demilitarised zone around Idlib, the last major rebel bastion in Syria.
The solution in Syria ""is a political one, not a military one,"" Ibrahim Kalin, spokesperson for the Turkish president, said on Friday.
Erdogan and his guests - German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Emmanuel Macron and Russian President Vladimir Putin - will also hold discussions on humanitarian aid, the drafting of a constitution and reconstruction of the war-torn country.
On Friday, seven people were killed in rebel-held areas in Idlib after Syrian government forces shelled two villages, according to opposition activists.
The UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) said three children were among those killed in the shelling of Rafa and Umm Jalal villages.
The White Helmets, a civil defence group operating in rebel-held parts of Syria, also reported the same death toll, as cited by Anadolu news agency.
The villages are part of the demilitarised zone in Idlib, agreed by Turkey and Russia in Sochi last month.
The agreement reached between Russia and Syria prevented a government offensive on the last rebel stronghold in the country.
Idlib has been relatively calm since, though some armed groups have not met an October 15 deadline to evacuate the demilitarised zone.
Many feared that a government offensive in Idlib would trigger a new refugee crisis as the region is home to some three million people, many of whom were already displaced by the war from other parts of Syria.
France has said it intends primarily to promote the maintenance of the ceasefire in Idlib to avoid a humanitarian catastrophe and a new mass wave of refugees.
Paris also said it wants the effective launch of an inclusive political process in accordance with a United Nations resolution.
The summit comes amid Turkish threats of a new military operation across the border into northern Syria, in zones held by Syrian Kurdish fighters.
Turkey considers the Syrian Kurdish militia, which is backed by the United States, to be ""terrorists"" and a part of the Kurdish armed campaign within Turkey.
On Friday, Erdogan said Ankara would not allow ""terror groups located east of the Euphrates River"" to threaten Turkey's security.
Turkey launched two incursions into Syria, in 2016 and 2018, into areas west of the Euphrates, pushing fighters from the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) armed group as well as Syrian Kurdish fighters from its border.

Speaking at the House of Commons on Thursday, Home Secretary Sajid Javid said: ""at the end of June we became aware of some immigration cases where the provision of DNA evidence had been made a requirement - and it was not simply a request.
""This published guidance was wrong and has now been updated ... Today I want to take this opportunity to apologise to those who have been affected by this process.""
According to the Guardian newspaper, a review by the Home Office found that at least 449 demands for DNA were issued to migrants, including 51 to Gurkha soldiers - Nepalese recruits who served in the British military - and some to Afghan nationals who worked as translators for the UK.
The paper said at least seven people, including four from one family, were denied the right to stay in the UK because they refused to provide DNA samples to prove they had family ties.
""No one should have faced a demand to provide DNA evidence and no one should have been penalised for not providing it,"" Javid said.
""Mandatory testing should not have been part of this scheme and this requirement has now been removed.""
Campaigners described Thursday's revelation as another sign that despite the Windrush scandal, the government ""consistently encouraged policies and practice which disrespect the law"".
The Windrush scandal refers to immigrants from Caribbean countries such as Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago and Barbados who were invited to the UK between 1948 and 1971 and later wrongly detained, denied legal rights and threatened with deportation.
Steve Valdez-Symonds, Amnesty International's UK refugee and migrant rights programme director, said the Home Office had ""once again been exposed as being a law unto itself"".
""The home secretary needs to face up to the fact that problems in his department are systemic, chronic and deep-rooted. Over several decades, successive governments have consistently encouraged policies and practice which disrespect the law and harm the people directly affected.
""This dysfunctional department cannot continue to be rewarded by being given more powers while vital safeguards, such as appeal rights and legal aid, are stripped away.""

The border was closed, so sticking to the highway was not an option.
Sanchez, her partner and their baby daughter left Ocotepeque, Honduras on foot at 2am and arrived at the migrant shelter over the border in Esquipulas, Guatemala, shortly before mid-day on Monday.
""There was no way through. We went into the bush,"" Sanchez told Al Jazeera, her blistered feet resting atop worn shoes. ""We passed through forest. We crossed rivers.""
Sanchez, 30, and her family are among several groups of Hondurans attempting to make their way north, following in the footsteps of thousands of migrants and refugees who have made the trek over the past week. Most say they are fleeing unemployment and violence, but some told Al Jazeera they are fleeing political persecution and other targeted threats.
The initial wave, dubbed a migrant caravan, now has more than 5,000 participants and is making its way through southern Mexico.
US President Donald Trump ramped up his threats against Central American countries on Monday, tweeting the US would begin cutting or substantially reducing aid to the region. He also said that had put the US military and Border Patrol on alert.
Amid the threats, the governments of Honduras, Guatemala and Mexico fortified parts of their borders, deployed police and military forces and held or returned migrants and refugees.
Some of these measures violate international law or risk doing so, according to human rights groups and international agencies.
Trump on Sunday tweeted that people should first seek asylum in Mexico, ""and if they fail to do that, the U.S. will turn them away"".
""The courts are asking the U.S. to do things that are not doable!"" he said.
But there is no obligation to first apply for asylum in Mexico, legal experts and human rights organisations point out, and requiring Central Americans to do so would violate international law.
""Congress adopted the Refugee Act of 1980 to bring the United States into line with its obligations to protect refugees under international law,"" Human Rights First, a US-based group, wrote in a statement Monday debunking several of Trump's tweets about the migrant caravan.
""The United States is obliged to provide protection to people fleeing persecution, including asylum seekers. These individuals are entitled to a screening interview to determine whether they have a credible fear of persecution,"" the group wrote.
For those who do plan on applying for asylum in Mexico, Amnesty International says they are essentially being detained in areas that authorities describe as a shelter.
More than 1,000 people have already done so, Madeleine Penman, a researcher on Mexico for Amnesty based in Mexico City, told Al Jazeera via telephone.
""At this stage, they're applying a regime of mandatory detention to [those] who even ask for asylum,"" she said. ""So they have made available a shelter for members of the caravan. However, the reality of the shelter is that it is functioning as a detention centre.""
Once people are inside, the only ways they can get out are deportation or a stay of weeks or months, Penman added.
""The Mexican government has shown itself as routinely violating international law in the past by returning every year thousands of people who could be at risk of their lives in countries such as Honduras,"" she said.
Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto issued a statement on Friday, declaring that, ""like any other sovereign country, Mexico does not permit, nor will it permit, entry into its territory in an irregular manner, and much less in a violent manner,"" referring to the initial caravan group Friday, when thousands pushed past fences, resulting in a clash with police, who used tear gas on the crowd.
""Members of the caravan may request entry according to the manners established by our laws and international law,"" Pena Nieto said.
The Mexican National Immigration Institute did not respond to Al Jazeera's repeated requests for comment.
In Guatemala, caravan participants have been stopped by police checkpoints.
Suspected migrants and refugees are asked to show a slip of paper granting permission to enter from Guatemalan immigration authorities. Many do not have the official document as Guatemala's immigration control centre at the Agua Caliente border cross was shut down last Tuesday, reopened Thursday, and has since been shut down.
Hondurans who cannot produce the small document are transported back to the Honduran side of the border, where police prevent their exit from the country, more than a dozen migrants, refugees, police officers and local taxi drivers confirmed to Al Jazeera.
The Honduran government announced on Saturday that its immigration control point at the Agua Caliente border crossing would be closed until further notice. The measure was due to a ""crisis provoked by sectors outside of national interests"", the Honduran National Immigration Institute said in a statement.
Days prior to the immigration control point shutdown, Honduran police blocked the way out for those looking to flee, using force to prevent their exit.
On both sides of the border, there has been a heavy presence of security forces as Honduran police stop migrants and refugees from crossing into Guatemala.
Guatemalan soldiers were also in the area, as were US-donated Jeep J8 vehicles belonging to a border region task force.
On the Honduran side, members of the US-trained TIGRES and Rurales special police forces stood with riot gear across the road, checking the identification of pedestrians who were let through because they were Guatemalan locals heading home. A handful of Honduran soldiers were also in the vicinity.
According to a general of the Honduran police force, there were about 200 police and special forces resting nearby.
Additional forces were sent following the incident Saturday when hundreds of people, as well as a semi-trailer, pushed through police lines after being forbidden to leave their country.
""This blocking of the border between Honduras and Guatemala is completely unprecedented and violates international law,"" Penman told Al Jazeera.
UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres was in touch with different leaders in the region over the weekend, Deputy Spokesman for the Secretary-General Farhan Haq said at a daily press briefing on Monday.
""The thing [Guterres] has been stressing is the need for the leaders to work with the International Organization for Migration, the IOM, and the UN Refugee Agency, UNHCR. He believes that this situation needs to be dealt with in line with international law and with full respect for countries' rights to manage their own borders,"" Haq said.
Article 13 of the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights guarantees the right to freedom of movement and also states that ""everyone has the right to leave any country, including his own,"" noted Penman.
Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador and Nicaragua make up the C4 region and have border, immigration and customs agreements. Citizens of the four countries are supposed to have freedom of movement within the region using their national identification cards, with no passport or visa requirements.
""Honduras cannot act as a closed country at the moment. Guatemala cannot undertake the unlawful return of people whose lives are at risk,"" Penman said.
Al Jazeera contacted the spokesman for the Guatemalan Ministry of the Interior, which governs the national police force, as well as the presidential spokesman, but neither responded to requests for comment by the time of publication. Al Jazeera also attempted to reach Honduran officials, but they were not immediately available for comment.
Humanitarian, human rights and solidarity responses are needed from the Central American and Mexican governments, according to Penman.
""We do not need these governments to be intimidated by Trump at this time. We also call on US Congress to block the unlawful decisions that Trump may make,"" she said.
But more than 5,000km by road from Washington, DC, migrants and refugees like Kenia Sanchez face the consequences of US pressure on Central American governments to shut the caravan down.

At the Casa del Migrante Jose shelter in Esquipulas, Sanchez rested her feet, nursing her one-and-a-half-year-old daughter. She and her family had no choice but to leave their home in the Olancho department in eastern Honduras, she said.
""Sometimes we do not eat. There is no work,"" she said, adding that her partner has been threatened by criminal gang members when he has visited his relatives in the capital.
Faced with a border shutdown, Sanchez and her family have one day of walking down. There are police and immigration checkpoints along the road heading north, so, for now, they plan to wait for more Hondurans to come join them before setting off again.

On Monday, a delegation from the Italian interior ministry was expected in the Italian mountain village of Claviere, 80km north of Turin, to investigate increasing reports of illegal crossings by French officers.
""The French are trespassing, dumping migrants at their pleasure … but Italy is no longer the refugee camp of Europe,"" said Italian Interior Minister Matteo Salvini, as he ordered a fresh military deployment to check the border on Sunday.
Italian authorities claim that French officers disregard the frontier line as well as standard refoulement procedures for migrants, often dropping them in the woods between Claviere and the French town of Montgenevre.
To defuse the tensions, Christophe Castaner, the newly-appointed French interior minister, said he wished to improve border cooperation but called for more stringent measures against undocumented immigration, supposedly in Italy.
""We have to be more efficient in the expulsion procedures of illegal migrants or those whose asylum request have already been denied,"" he told Journal du Dimanche.
Salvini, who is also a deputy prime minister and the head of the far-right League party, did not wait long to issue a sharp retort.
""I am happy Castaner shares my views about illegal migrants. When I spoke of expulsions I was labelled a racist, even by the French. Better late than never"".
The Italian government's hard line on migration has come under fire by French President Emmanuel Macron, but Castaner has tried to refrain from engaging in a spat with Salvini.
Macron, however, has not hidden his antipathy for Salvini and his anti-migrant policies, describing the interior minister's approach as ""nauseating"".
The two have engaged in a tit-for-tat, with Salvini replying by calling Macron a hypocrite disguised as a humanitarian who invokes solidarity while pushing away migrants, including children.
Perhaps paradoxically, Salvini's accusations are now finding an echo in the opposite camp of human rights watchdogs.
On Wednesday, Amnesty International and 12 other charities accused France's authorities of mistreating refugees and migrants, including children, at the borders with Italy in what they described as the ""inhuman and hypocritical behaviour of the French authorities"".
The allegations came after a task force of 60 human rights lawyers and activists conducted a two-day mission at the French border town of Briancon, not far from Claviere.
""The list of violations is long, and we join our voices to those of local NGOs so that the French government stops turning a deaf ear and stops these illegal and degrading practices,"" said Agnes Lerolle, coordinator of the French-Italian task force.
""This inhuman and hypocritical behaviour is unacceptable in a state of law.""
Amnesty said the violations include obstruction of asylum requests, neglect of unaccompanied minors, mistreatment, harassment and denial of emergency healthcare and humanitarian assistance.
""The attitude of French border control authorities is appalling,"" Riccardo Noury, a spokesperson for Amnesty told Al Jazeera. ""The use of threats, scornful and aggressive behaviour towards defenceless people, especially migrant children, is deplorable.""
Amnesty denounced a systematic violation of the rights of migrants to request asylum. Under international law, migrants should always be granted the right to request asylum and unaccompanied children should be provided immediate protection, regardless of their status.
""France is violating both principles,"" Noury said.
The French Ministry of Interior did not respond to Al Jazeera's request for comment on the alleged abuses.
In one documented case, an Ivorian migrant was denied medical care after sustaining an injury during a chase by French guards in the woods.
""Border police threatened to shoot him down if he didn't stop,"" said Noury. ""He received medical attention only after being taken back into Italy.""
An unaccompanied minor from Ivory Coast told Amnesty the French border police refused to acknowledge his age, saying ""all migrants claim to be minors"".
""I was told, I cannot live in France if I am not a French citizen and I can never hope to become one,"" the minor told the UK-based rights group.
In just two days, the task force witnessed 26 cases of migrants pushed back into Italy, eight of whom were unaccompanied minors. According to Amnesty, at least 11 of these refoulements were illegal and its lawyers have appealed to the Tribunal of Marseilles for their annulment.
In June, Oxfam, Intersos and other human rights watchdogs condemned French methods - especially towards minor children along the southern border with Italy.
They said minors as young as 12 were being held without food or care, put on trains or left at the border without any assistance despite their requests to remain in France.
The charities accused French police of falsifying the birth dates of migrant children travelling alone in an attempt to pass them off as adults and send them back to Italy, as well as cutting the soles off their shoes to prevent them from trespassing again.
But while France is allegedly violating the fundamental human rights of migrants, Italy has also come under criticism for its inability to implement a strict registration system of refugees arriving on its soil.
The country has been unable to sustain a proper registration process for asylum seekers, who at times arrive by the thousands on Italian shores. Most migrants' centres are near collapse.
There is no mechanism in place allowing for an integration process and stranded refugees remain exposed to the web of illegal labour and human trafficking at the hands of criminal organisations.
""In this ongoing ping-pong game of migrants between France and Italy there is a fundamental international norm that is being violated: the right to asylum,"" said Noury.
""The Dublin Accord has turned the countries of the south, like Italy and Greece, into parking lots for human beings, because it lacks a solidarity principle of redistribution of migrants.""
The accord stipulates that a migrant should file their asylum request in the country of entry. The evaluation process can last many months and its acceptance is not granted. In the meantime, the host nation is left to bear the migrant's costs indefinitely.
Southern countries such as Italy and Greece say refugees and migrants should be distributed among European states. Many also believe that the Dublin system pushes migrants to choose illegal ways to reach the north of Europe, thus increasing human trafficking.
According to estimates with the Italian Ministry of Interior, out of 82,000 asylum requests examined in 2017, some 52.4 percent were not eligible. Today, there are an estimated 600,000 undocumented migrants in Italy.
""There is consensus over the fact that Dublin needs to be changed, but we are stuck,"" Hanne Beirens, acting director of the Migration Policy Institute Europe, told Al Jazeera.
""In the absence of a politically acceptable solution, countries are now adopting these ad hoc measures at the borders, like stopping secondary movements of migrants within Europe.""

https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/10/migrant-caravan-stopped-mexico-guatemala-border-181020055643727.html,refugee,915,Sat Oct 20 2018 07:40:20 GMT+0000,None,Migrant caravan stopped on Mexico-Guatemala border,"Hundreds of people in a caravan of migrants and refugees that crossed from Honduras into Guatemala staged a dramatic bid to breach the Mexican border on Friday, as local governments began preparing to disperse the convoy under pressure from Washington.
Caravan members poured through Guatemalan border posts in the town of Tecun Uman and onto a bridge leading to Mexico, only to be halted by dozens of Mexican police in riot gear. Mexico's president sharply rebuked the migrants for the border surge.
US President Donald Trump has warned the Central American caravan must be stopped before it reaches the United States, and Honduras and Guatemala said late on Friday they were mobilising to assist the return of Honduran migrants to their homeland.
Some migrants violently shook fences at the border and police said a few officers were injured in clashes. A handful of people jumped into the Suchiate River below to swim for rafts. Others turned back towards Guatemala.
Carrying backpacks and small children, many bedraggled migrants simply sat down on the bridge. Some said that they had been teargassed. As the afternoon drew on, a tropical storm, Vicente, formed nearby off the Pacific coast.
Jose Brian Guerrero, a 24-year-old Honduran travelling with neighbours and his extended family, said he had joined the caravan to escape violent street gangs, and to find work.
""There's nothing for us in our country,"" said Guerrero, who used to sell beans in Honduras.
On Friday evening, Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez said he had spoken to his Guatemalan counterpart Jimmy Morales for clearance to send civil protection personnel to help the Hondurans and to find transport for those wanting to return.
""We'll continue this operation for as long as is necessary,"" Hernandez said in a post on Twitter.
Shortly afterwards, Guatemala's government tweeted that Hernandez would meet Morales on Saturday in Guatemala City to implement a strategy for returning the Honduran migrants.
Meanwhile, in a late televised address, Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto called the mass rush to penetrate the border ""unprecedented"", accusing some migrants of attacking police.
""Mexico does not and will not allow (people) to enter its territory illegally, let alone violently,"" he said.
A similar caravan of Central Americans that formed in southern Mexico in late March also drew the ire of Trump, who on Thursday threatened to use the military and close the southern border if Mexico did not halt the new march.
Such a move would cause chaos on the crossing, one of the world's busiest, and badly disrupt trade.
Speaking in Scottsdale, Arizona on Friday, Trump said he ""appreciated very much"" Mexico's efforts to stop the caravan.
""If that doesn't work out, we're calling up the military - not the (National) Guard - we're calling up the military,"" he told reporters. ""They're not coming into this country.""
Trump has also threatened to cut off aid to Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador - some of the poorest and most violent countries in the Americas - if they fail to prevent undocumented immigrants from heading to the US.
Their emigrants make up the bulk of people now caught trying to enter the US illegally every year.
Several migrants at the Guatemala-Mexico border spoke of entire neighbourhoods leaving their homes to join the trek after news circulated on social media of a call for a new ""caravan"" to Mexico six months after the previous one.
Earlier, Mexican Foreign Minister Luis Videgaray and US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo met in Mexico City and discussed the caravan, which set off from Honduras last weekend.
""It's a challenge that Mexico is facing, and that's how I expressed it to Secretary Pompeo,"" Videgaray told a joint news conference.
Pompeo said he and Videgaray spoke of the importance of stopping the caravan before it reaches the US border.
In contrast to the earlier caravan, which had advanced into Mexico before officials began intensive efforts to process the migrants, the Mexican government turned its attention to the new group right on its southern border.
Mexico's government has sought assistance from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).
On Friday morning, Videgaray said the caravan had close to 4,000 people and that the migrants could individually present their claims to enter Mexico or seek refugee status.
""We haven't had a caravan or group of this size seeking refuge at the same time, that's why we've sought the support of the United Nations,"" he told Mexican television.
Mexico says the migrants without a legitimate case to claim refuge in Mexico will be returned to their countries of origin. A Mexican official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the country had the capacity to process around 200 people a day.
Hundreds of Mexican police were sent to guard the border between the Guatemalan town of Tecun Uman and Ciudad Hidalgo in Mexico to prepare for the migrant caravan's arrival.
Manelich Castilla, the head of Mexico's federal police, said at the scene that his officers had restored order after the rush of migrants towards the border, and would begin allowing people to be processed in an orderly fashion.
Six police had been injured, Castilla said.
UNHCR spokesman Charlie Yaxley said the agency was reinforcing capacity in southern Mexico to offer counselling, legal assistance and humanitarian aid to asylum seekers.
""UNHCR is concerned that the mobilization of such a large number of people in a single group will overwhelm the capacities that exist in the region,"" he told a news conference.

Prime Minister Scott Morrison said on Wednesday he was willing to brief non-government senators on a travel ban bill. ""There is no support for that bill at present,"" Morrison told reporters.
The opposition Labor Party has argued that a lifetime ban on the refugees ever visiting Australia on a tourist or business visa is unnecessary and against Australia's interests.
New Zealand citizens are allowed to live and work in Australia for life, a unique status the government fears banished refugees would use as a ""backdoor"" into Australia.
The conservative government is under mounting pressure to relax a five-year-old policy that detains asylum seekers who try to get to Australia by boat on Nauru and Manus islands and bans them from ever settling in Australia.
While the policy appears to have ended people-smuggling, there is mounting concern over the fate of hundreds of people, including children, confined to the Nauru detention centre and in Manus, which is reserved for single men and is part of Papua New Guinea.
The UN refugee agency urged the government last week to bring the asylum seekers to Australia amid a ""collapsing health situation"". Three government lawmakers have also appealed to Morrison to accept families with children from Nauru so they can receive adequate medical care.
Morrison's policy shift could also be influenced by a crucial by-election in a progressive Sydney electorate on Saturday with the government's single-seat majority in the lower house at stake.
The United States has agreed to resettle up to 1,250 refugees from the islands, but only 462 had found new homes in the US in the past 14 months, according to Refugee Action Coalition spokesman Ian Rintoul. A plane carrying 17 men from Papua New Guinea to the US left on Tuesday.
There are 1,337 refugees and asylum seekers on the islands, according to a government statement released on Wednesday.

The International Organisation for Migration (IOM) said it had identified 99 cases of human trafficking during the year since September 2017, although it cautioned that the actual number was likely far greater.
Of the victims, 35 were girls and 31 were women, the IOM said in a report this week. Thirty-one of the girls ended up in forced labour as did 26 of the women.
""The stories we commonly hear are of vulnerable people being approached by traffickers with false promises of work and a better life,"" said IOM spokeswoman Dina Parmer, adding some refugees were unaware of the risks.
""Others may be aware it is dangerous, but feel their situation is so desperate that they are willing to take extreme measures, perhaps sacrificing one family member for the sake of the rest of the family,"" she said in a statement.
The rest of the trafficking survivors comprised of 25 adult men and eight boys who were forced into labour. Five women and four girls ended up in situations of sexual exploitation.
The Bangladeshi charity Young Power in Social Action (YPSA) is raising awareness among refugees of the dangers of trafficking and has been collecting reports from Rohingya community leaders, as well as local and international groups.
""More than 1,000 have been identified as victims of human trafficking,"" said Jishu Barua of the YPSA.
More than 900,000 Rohingya, an ethnic and religious Muslim minority in Myanmar, live in Bangladesh's Cox's Bazar district, the vast majority in camps, according to the UN.
About 700,000 of them arrived in Bangladesh last year following a bloody military offensive launched by the Myanmar army.
The UN, the US and human rights groups have said civilians were targeted in the crackdown. In a report released last month, the UN fact-finding mission said that Myanmar's top generals - including Commander-in-Chief Min Aung Hlaing - must be investigated and prosecuted for genocide in Rakhine State.
Myanmar has denied most of the allegations.
Bangladesh bars refugees from leaving the camps or holding jobs other than participating in small-scale cash-for-work programmes run by humanitarian agencies, IOM noted.
""They are desperate to get out of the camps to make some money,"" Barua told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by phone from Cox's Bazar.
Traffickers prey on that desperation, offering transportation and work opportunities, according to IOM.
Among the cases IOM documented, one woman was forced to work ""extremely long hours for very little pay in the fish processing industry"", while girls and young women were used as domestic maids.

The Italian Swedish diplomat, who became the UN's third Syria envoy in July 2014, told the UN Security Council on Wednesday he was leaving for ""purely personal reasons"".
""I am not laying down the charge until the last hour of the last day of my mandate,"" he said.
De Mistura said he will be making an intensive effort to get agreement on a committee to draft a new constitution for war-torn Syria before he resigns next month.
Objections by the Syrian government are still holding up the launch of that committee, he said.
His departure will complicate UN peace efforts at a time when the Syrian government is continuing to make territorial gains, opening up prospects for a political settlement to end the war.
Among the names being floated as a possible successor are the UN's Middle East Peace Coordinator Nickolay Mladenov and the UN Envoy for Iraq Jan Kubic, the AFP news agency reported, citing UN diplomats.
De Mistura was appointed UN envoy for Syria after veteran Algerian diplomat Lakhdar Brahimi resigned following the failure of peace talks in Geneva in 2014.
Brahimi spent two years in the position, stepping in after former UN chief Kofi Annan quit just six months into the role.
Annan had described the Syria envoy's job as ""mission impossible"".
More than 360,000 people have died in the war in Syria, which began in March 2011 as an uprising against President Bashar al-Assad but has since morphed into a complex war with myriad armed groups, some of which have foreign backing.
During his tenure, De Mistura worked to keep UN-sponsored peace talks alive even as fighting on the ground killed off chances of a deal.
""We will continue asking until we are red in the face, blue in the face for both sides ... to stop shelling each other's area,"" de Mistura told reporters about a ceasefire effort earlier this year.
Last year, Russia, Iran and Turkey set up the Astana process to advance diplomatic efforts in Syria, a move that effectively sidelined the UN-led process that De Mistura was shepherding in Geneva.
Still, the 71-year-old diplomat showed tenacity in the job.
While there were no breakthroughs in peace talks in Geneva, he insisted that incremental progress was being made.
He was consumed in recent weeks with preventing a bloodbath in Idlib, the last rebel-held region in Syria, engaging in conversations with stakeholders from Russia, Iran, Turkey and Syria.
In his efforts to put an end to Syria's seven years of violence, de Mistura navigated between world powers Russia and the US, regional players - Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Iran - as well as the feuding factions within Syria.
His latest push for a committee to agree on a new constitution and power-sharing arrangements for Syria could pave the way for reconstruction aid and refugee return.
On Wednesday, he reiterated that there is agreement on 50-member government and opposition delegations - but the government objects to the 50-member delegation the UN put together representing Syrian experts, civil society, independents, tribal leaders and women.
De Mistura said will go to Damascus next week to discuss the committee's formation.

About 500 protesters representing 30 different groups from around rural Australia, including high school students, took part in the rally, amid mounting concern over a five-year-old offshore detention policy that requires any asylum seekers who attempt to get to Australia by boat to be held offshore and banned from ever settling in Australia itself.
The march was organised to ""focus attention on the plight of asylum seekers and refugees who remain on Nauru and Manus Island, and particularly the need to provide homes and safety for children and their families either in Australia, or in another country that would welcome them"", Rural Australians for Refugees said in a statement.
On Monday, nearly 6,000 doctors delivered a letter calling on Prime Minister Scott Morrison to remove children from detention given the serious physical and mental health risks they face.
""The medical profession is demanding children and families be moved from Nauru,"" the Australian Medical Association tweeted on Tuesday. ""For thousands of doctors to be motivated to take this course of action is testament to the severity and the urgency of this issue.""
Three representatives from the ruling Liberal Party also broke ranks to call for the children to be brought to Australia.
About 1,100 people are currently being held on Nauru including 102 children, according to the Asylum Seeker Resource Centre. Single men are detained on nearby Manus Island.
The fate of the families threatens to become a major political problem for Morrison's government, which has a parliamentary majority of just a single seat and is facing a by-election this weekend in Sydney.
The constituency of Wentworth, which includes the beachfront suburb Bondi and some of the city's wealthiest neighbourhoods, was previously held by Malcolm Turnbull who was deposed by Morrison in late August.
""The issue is front and centre of the by-election campaign,"" said Al Jazeera correspondent Andrew Thomas.
In a close race, the Liberal Party is defending a winning margin of 17.7 percent, which was supported by Turnbull's personal popularity. The electorate is seen as one of the most progressive in Sydney.
Doctors Without Borders (known by its French initials, MSF), which worked on Nauru for nearly a year until it was forced to leave by the island's government last week, said the mental health situation was ""beyond desperate"". The medical group was given just 24 hours to leave.
""The mental health situation of the refugees indefinitely held on Nauru is devastating,"" Dr Beth O'Connor, MSF psychiatrist, said in a statement last week. ""Over the past 11 months on Nauru, I have seen an alarming number of suicide attempts and incidents of self-harm among the refugee and asylum-seeker men, women and children we treat.""
Some children were suffering from traumatic withdrawal syndrome and were unable to eat, drink or even walk to the toilet, O'Connor added.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees has also called for the evacuation of the offshore camps given the deteriorating health of those confined there, stressing that Australia has a responsibility to those that seek its protection.
Meanwhile, Morrison's government is also facing ridicule after some of its own members backed a parliamentary motion declaring ""it is OK to be white"".
Officials blamed an ""administrative process failure"" after it emerged on Tuesday that the attorney general had issued instructions to Liberal members to back the motion, drafted by right-wing populist Pauline Hanson and railing against what it described as ""the deplorable rise of anti-white racism"".
The motion was defeated 31-28, with several government ministers voting in favour, including its top official for indigenous affairs.

https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/10/greek-official-blows-whistle-refugee-costs-181012195955232.html,refugee,1083,Mon Oct 15 2018 23:59:31 GMT+0000,John Psaropoulos,Greek official blows the whistle on refugee costs,"A senior Greek official has described the way the government buys migration-related services as ""chaos,"" after Greece's top court ordered an inquiry into the handling of European Union funds paid to Athens to assist with the refugee and migration crisis.
Andreas Iliopoulos, the head of the government agency that registers refugees and migrants in Greece, says Greek and European taxpayers may be subject to fraud because many contracts are awarded directly without going through a competitive bidding process.
""[Fast-track procedures mean] I can go directly to interested parties. I can come to you and make a deal without revealing too much information to others,"" Iliopoulos told Al Jazeera in an exclusive interview.
The so-called fast-track funding was introduced in 2015 at the height of the refugee crisis, but continuing with that policy is harder to justify now, said Iliopoulos.
""That makes sense when people are landing on the beach and we have to feed them and there are no obvious means of doing so.""
Andreas Iliopoulos, former head of Reception and Identification Service
Greece depends on the EU to run services for about 60,000 asylum seekers and migrants who live in the country. The EU covers some 70 to 80 percent of costs.
Athens applies for the EU funding after it has already awarded contracts for services, and it could be months before it finds out if the EU will pay.
Iliopoulos said fast-track claims are more likely to be disqualified by the EU.
""When a funding request is rejected, it's paid by Greek taxpayers,"" he said. ""Right now, it's my impression that a sum of about 10 million euros ($11.6m) worth of funding claims may be dismissed for services like catering, sewage treatment and others.""
Iliopoulos first blew the whistle on the alleged corruption in the functioning of the Reception and Identification Service (RIS) in an interview with the Fileleftheros newspaper on October 4.
Four days later, the Greek Supreme Court ordered an inquiry into the handling of European funds paid to Athens to assist the country with the refugee crisis of 2015-16.
The European Commission has allocated $1.8bn to Greece for migration-related costs for the 2014-2020 period, and has earmarked even more.
It's unknown exactly how many Greek contracts the EU has rejected for co-funding.
Al Jazeera has seen a number of directly awarded government contracts.
""We award this contract, through a process of negotiation, without the proclamation of a competitive bidding process,"" is a typical phrase used to buy catering services and to rent housing.
These contracts can involve substantial sums. A 10-day contract to feed 8,300 people in Moria camp on the island of Lesbos, is worth 415,000 euros, or close to half a million dollars, minus a 4.2 percent tax.
None of the catering contracts seen by Al Jazeera contains specifications as to what food is to be served, only that the contractor must serve three meals a day and 1.5 litres of bottled water; so the contractor is able to expand its profit margin at the expense of providing quality food.
Asylum seekers frequently complain about the food mess on the islands and use their own money to buy fresh produce to cook.
Iliopoulos says the contracts that brought his biggest disagreements with the government concerned sewage shipments from Moria camp to a treatment plant about four kilometres away.
""We can't go on saying catering needs to be contracted under fast-track procedures, or sewage needs to be taken away by trucks at a cost that looks quite impressive on paper. This has to change,"" he said.
Plans for a pipeline connecting Moria to the plant have been ready for at least two years, said Iliopoulos.
The regional governor for the north Aegean, Christiana Kalogirou, confirmed this, adding that trucks are not sufficient for the job.
""Not connecting Moria to [the plant] leads to the sewage being dumped in the surrounding dry river beds,"" she told Al Jazeera.
""We have been forced in the interests of public health and the environment, to impose fines of 50,000 and 80,000 euros ($58,000 and $92,000) on the migration ministry because the water table is being contaminated.""
Kalogirou said pipeline construction has now been slated to start in December and is expected to take six months.
Iliopoulos said camp maintenance is sub-contracted to NGOs he cannot probe. ""I've asked for the contracts we have with aid groups that receive EU funding,"" he said.
""What do they do, exactly? ... I've asked the [migration] ministry for this information. No one has given me an answer.""
Migration Minister Dimitris Vitsas declined to comment on the allegations.
Vitsas previously told a local Greek television channel that he tried to dismiss Iliopoulos after he first blew the whistle.
""I called him and told him that we cannot continue to work together … and because I respect him and his rank, I asked him to choose whether to resign or follow the severance procedure which would entitle him to compensation,"" he said.
The launch of a judicial inquiry was the government's second migration-related embarrassment in the past month.
On September 22, Defence Minister Panos Kammenos sued the Fileleftheros newspaper, for alleging that his ministry had mishandled funds for services meant for refugees.
Pictures on national television showed three journalists with their hands cuffed behind their backs being led into the Athens police headquarters. The journalists were released the same day.
""The prosecutor threw out the libel charge and ordered a preliminary investigation. He did not charge us,"" says Fileleftheros' editor, Panayotis Lampsias.
""Mr Kammenos tried to intimidate us, and through us, to silence the rest of the media. We don't accept these threats. We continue to do our work.""
The European Commission said on September 26 that it had not found proof of wrongdoing, but had referred the matter to OLAF, the EU Anti-Fraud Office.
Vitsas defended the government in a second interview on state television on October 9.
""In the last three years, catering alone cost over 300 million [euros] ($347m), home rentals cost another 200-300 million ($232m-$347m), and if you add the construction costs for 34 reception centres, which at one point were as many as 40 … you'll see that the total cost is not only justified, it is more than made up for.""
Iliopoulos insisted that the system is broken.
""What does this chaos enable? Certainly not oversight and spending money effectively. The money that's been spent on NGOs and the state doesn't justify what we're seeing right now.""

Upon arriving at Madrid's airport Saturday, Saleh told the media and a small group of exuberant Venezuelan opposition supporters that ""the fight goes on"".
""What I ask is that we all think about the fact that in Venezuela there are innocent people behind bars, people that have been kidnapped and who deserve to cross the same bridge that I have,"" Saleh said.
Saleh said that he did not know he was being released until the last minute.
""They had already put me in a police car and we were heading to the airport when they told me,"" Saleh said.
""Today, I have been able to see the sunrise for the first time in four years, and I am still coming to grips with that.""
His release came just days after Fernando Alban, a Caracas city council member accused of taking part in a failed drone attack on President Nicolas Maduro, died in pretrial detention, an incident that sparked international outrage.
Authorities say the 52-year-old committed suicide by jumping out of a 10th-floor window of the state intelligence service headquarters. But his supporters and family say he was tortured to death and then thrown out.
Several foreign governments and the United Nations have called for an independent investigation to determine whether foul play was involved.
A government truth commission said Saleh was at risk of causing harm to himself after being evaluated for suicidal tendencies while imprisoned. It said he should be released as part of efforts to ease political tensions in the South American nation.
Saleh was arrested in Colombia in 2014 after he appeared on a video phone call leaked by Venezuelan authorities bragging to an unknown person about plans to hire sharpshooters to sow unrest in Venezuela and was extradited, .
His extradition was widely condemned by human rights groups, who argued he could never get a fair trial in Venezuela and would be subjected to harsh conditions of confinement.
News of Saleh's release on Saturday also came as a shock to his supporters, and even his mother, who rushed to a Caracas jail expecting to receive her son only to learn he had been sent to Europe.
""I didn't know anything about this. I thought he'd be turned over here, but what's important is that he's free,"" a weeping Yamile Saleh told journalists outside the jail.
""He tried to calm me, saying he is with people he trusts,"" she said after speaking to her son by phone.
Saleh thanked Spain for its role in his release and said that he hoped to see his mother soon.
Spain released a statement following Saleh's arrival saying that diplomat Juan Pablo de Laiglesia had travelled with Saleh.
The statement said Spain considered Saleh's release ""the correct decision by the Venezuelan government to move in the correct direction of helping generate a climate of trust"".

https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/10/profile-andrew-brunson-pastor-detained-turkey-181012074308490.html,refugee,690,Fri Oct 12 2018 15:47:36 GMT+0000,None,"Profile: Who is Andrew Brunson, the US pastor released by Turkey?","A Turkish court on Friday ordered the release of American pastor Andrew Brunson, who has been held for the last two years in Turkey, in a case that sparked a crisis in ties with the US.
The court in Izmir convicted Brunson on terror-related charges and sentenced him to three years, one month and 15 days in jail, Al Jazeera's Sinem Koseoglu said
However, Brunson was freed, taking into account time served and good conduct during the trial, with the court lifting his house arrest and overseas travel ban. He flew out of Turkey on Friday evening.
The 50-year-old evangelical preacher was imprisoned in October 2016, following a failed coup attempt in July that claimed more than 250 lives and wounded nearly 2,000 people.
Turkey blamed Fethullah Gulen, a former ally of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, for the failed coup. Gulen, who has denied any involvement, lives in the US in self-imposed exile.
Brunson was detained for 24 months, charged with terrorism by the Turkish government for alleged links to Gulen's organisation and attempts to convert Kurds to Christianity to sow discord in Turkey, according to his indictment.
He had been under house arrest since July.
The preacher, originally from North Carolina, has lived in Turkey for two decades. He is the pastor of the Izmir Resurrection Church, a small congregation of about 25 people.
Brunson and his wife raised three children in Izmir, a Turkish city on the Aegean coast, according to The Economist.
His children have been educated in Turkish schools and two of them were born in the country, according to the European Centre for Law and Justice, which has advocated for the pastor's release.
The Izmir Resurrection Church belongs to the Evangelical Presbyterian Church, an ideologically centrist group within ""Presbyterianism's liberal-conservative spectrum"", The Economist wrote.
The US preacher's detention adversely affected US-Turkey relations, triggering sanctions and tariffs against Ankara.
US President Donald Trump, who had called for the pastor's release, said a ""great patriot"" was being held ""hostage"".
The diplomatic spat put increased pressure on the Turkish economy, decreasing the value of Turkey's currency, the lira.
Turkey is an important ally of both the US and the European Union. Ankara plays a strong role in the Middle East, including mitigating the refugee crisis and putting pressure on the government of President Bashar al-Assad in Syria.
""Look, the Turkish government made a big mistake in not releasing Pastor Brunson,"" US National Security Adviser John Bolton told the Reuters news agency in an interview during a visit to Israel.
""Every day that goes by that mistake continues, this crisis could be over instantly if they did the right thing as a NATO ally, part of the West, and release pastor Brunson without condition.""
Brunson's case has become a rallying cry for US evangelicals, a powerful segment of Trump's support base.
Vice President Mike Pence, himself an evangelical, said ""Brunson is an innocent man, there is no credible evidence against him,"" in July, before threatening ""significant sanctions on Turkey.
John Fea, a professor at Messiah College and author of Believe Me: The Evangelical Road to Donald Trump, told Turkish agency Ahval that ""Religious liberty was one of Trump's most important campaign promises to American evangelicals. Every time he and Mike Pence weigh in on the Brunson case, they score points with this part of his political base"".
According to Turkish state media TRT World, Christian lobbyists in Washington, DC, pushed Brunson's case among legislators and recommended sanctions against Ankara.
Turkish leaders repeatedly rejected US calls for Brunson's release.
""Attempting to force my government to intervene in the judicial process is not in line with our constitution or our shared democratic values"", Erdogan warned in a New York Times opinion piece published in August.
Brunson's imprisonment also prompted accusations that minority religions in Turkey were under 'pressure' from the government that inhibited the practice of their faiths.
Leaders of every minority faith, including figureheads of Turkey's Christian community, however, signed a joint declaration in July that denied government interference in the practice of their faiths.

They seem calm and their voices sound peaceful, although most Syria observers would find their words hard to accept.
At the heart of their message: Syria is a safe country for refugees to return to.
Alternative Help Association - a far-right identitarian organisation from Germany, known by its acronym AHA, is back in the Middle East.
Several months after their trip to Lebanon, which Al Jazeera reported on in June this year, the group has now visited Syria, taking its involvement in the region to the next level.
Its key aim is to keep Syrian refugees in the Middle East out of Europe.
While marginal and involved in small-scale projects, AHA has sparked outrage as the only NGO which aims to prevent refugees from reaching safety in Europe.
In Lebanon, the group discouraged refugees there from travelling west.
With the new phase of their project in the Syrian village of Maaloula, the group is sending yet another message: that areas controlled by Syrian President Bashar al Assad's forces are safe. Syrian refugees should now rush to return back home to rebuild their war-damaged country.
Home to heavy fighting in 2013 and 2014, Maaloula, 55km north of Damascus, is a Christian village and one of the few places where the local population speaks Aramaic - the language of Jesus Christ.
Wassim, Syrian refugee journalist in Europe
""The purpose of AHA's first visit in Syria was mainly to get a foot on the ground, establish first contacts with local players and figure out by what means we can provide help where it is needed,"" Mario Muller, one of the AHA workers who appears in the video, told Al Jazeera.
""Reasonable help for Syrians can only take place locally: every Euro we spent in our country for social benefits, integration and security related to refugees will do much better in their homeland.""
The group claims to have made a donation to the Maaloula Foundation to rebuild a parish hall for the local community and is considering sending volunteers to the village to work and share ""cultural experiences"" with young Syrians.
Wassim, a Syrian journalist currently working in Europe, said the far-right group's project was ""hard to understand"".
He left Syria in November 2012 following a six-month detention in the Air Force Intelligence Directorate in Damascus suburbs.
""It's hard for me to understand how anyone could ask the Syrians to come back to a country where the government is arresting the White Helmets and accusing them of being terrorists, while all they do is saving the people bombed by the same government.
""Or ask people to get back to a country where more than 250,000 persons are missing after getting arrested by the regime,"" Wassim told Al Jazeera.
He says he was arrested for helping a foreign media outlet cover the situation in his neighbourhood. After two weeks of torture, including electric shocks, beating and hanging upside down, he confessed to everything the Assad government accused him of.
""You didn't have to carry a gun or attend the protests to be considered a traitor. Not showing your support for the regime alone could make you one,"" Wassim added.
""I don't think anyone who had written a single word against the regime, or even joined any discussion about the regime would dare to even think about getting back to Syria.""
AHA's last visit aims to demonstrate that Assad's government will ensure Syria's stability, a view held widely across the European far right.
AHA was founded in the summer of 2017 by the German Identitare Bewegung (German Identity Movement) - a local branch of the far-right identitarian movement.
Under the slogan of ""Homeland - Freedom - Tradition"", identitarians have sought to halt mass migration to Europe, secure national borders and preserve Europe's ethnocultural identity.
""It seems like Assad, though he surely doesn't run a Western democracy, is the only guarantee for the many minorities like Christians, Shia or Druze to have a future in their homeland"", Muller told Al Jazeera.
""We never felt insecure in those areas and the refugees can and have to return and help in rebuilding their country. This is also what many Syrians told us. Their country needs the refugees, now.""
According to international rights organisations such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, world leaders, hundreds of thousands of Syrians and the UN, the Syrian government has been responsible for some of the most egregious crimes in the war, including chemical attacks against civilians.
In March 2016, Staffan de Mistura, the UN's special envoy for Syria, estimated the death toll to be at around 400,000. The number killed is now believed to have risen above 500,000, while millions remain displaced and impoverished.

A decree published by state media on Tuesday said the amnesty applies to men ""inside and outside the country"" and covers all punishments for desertion.
Men inside Syria will have four months to take advantage of the amnesty while those outside will have six months.
The move could help boost the return of refugees, some of whom have not been able to go back home because they were blacklisted.
Under Syrian military law, deserters can face years of prison if they leave their posts and do not report for service within a set amount of time.
While Tuesday's amnesty covers desertion, it does not cover fighting against the government or joining the rebels, who are regarded by the Syrian government as ""terrorists"".
Syria's conflict began in 2011 after the mass uprising against Assad's rule met a brutal government crackdown. The violence escalated and the country descended into a civil war that has claimed up to half a million lives.
Many soldiers deserted, some to join the rebels and others to escape the fighting. More than half the prewar population fled their homes.
About five million went abroad and millions of others were displaced internally, creating one of the worst refugee crises of the modern times.
The decree comes at a time when government forces have managed to capture wide areas once held by rebel fighters, including in southern Syria and the eastern suburbs of the capital, Damascus.
The flashpoint in Syria is now the country's northwestern province of Idlib, the last remaining stronghold of rebels.
Lebanon says 50,000 Syrian refugees, among the more than a million it says are on its soil, have gone home voluntarily in assisted returns this year.
However, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) says conditions have not yet been fulfilled for mass refugee returns.
Speaking in Beirut in August, UNHCR chief Filippo Grandi said refugees were concerned about conscription, as well as other issues such as the lack of infrastructure.

More than 70,000 homes were destroyed or damaged by the magnitude 7.5 quake that struck on September 28, launching waves as high as six metres that slammed into Sulawesi at 800 km/h.
More than 2,500 people were injured and almost 75,000 displaced.
Live updates:
Children in Palu have started going back to school on Monday to tidy up their classrooms a10 days after a major earthquake and tsunami hit their city.
One school principal Kasiludin said authorities told all teachers to show up for work from Monday to collect information on the number of students returning to schools.
""We won't force the students to come back because many are traumatised. But we must start again soon to keep their spirits up and so they don't fall behind,"" he said.
At the SMP Negeri, 15 Palu middle school, fewer than 50 of its 697 students showed up.
Indonesia's government has said search efforts will continue until October 11, after which they hope people ""cant start living like normal"".
On Sunday, the death toll went up to 1,763, with 2,632 people seriously wounded.
So far, 186 people have been rescued in liquefaction areas, where the earth shifted and swallowed up buildings and people. Government officials are currently considering designating some areas as mass graves as hopes of recovering bodies fade.
On Sunday, Christians, who make up about 10 percent of Palu's population, sought solace in sermons, Many traveled into the city in search of a church after their local place of worship was destroyed.
As relief efforts finally began to reach remote areas, a clearer picture of the extent of the damage is starting to form. Almost 3,000 schools have been damaged, according to the Ministry of Education. Most of those worst hit are in the central Sigi district.
On Saturday, Indonesia's top security minister, Wiranto, said the government is considering designating Balaroa and Petobo - two Palu neighbourhoods essentially wiped off the map - as mass graves.
Rescue efforts have halted as officials say there is little hope of finding survivors under the rubble after a week, but searches for remains continue.
Petobo disappeared into the earth as the force of the quake liquified its soft soil. Liquefaction also struck a large section of Balaroa.
Hundreds of bodies are thought to be buried beneath the ruins of the two towns.
Wiranto said it is not safe for heavy equipment to operate there and that the government is in discussion with local and religious authorities, as well as the victim's families, to halt search efforts and have these areas declared as mass graves, saying the victims can be considered ""martyrs"".
Rescuers issued a fresh public health warning on Saturday as more decaying corpses were unearthed from beneath the ruined city of Palu.
There are fears that vast numbers of bodies could be buried beneath Petobo and Balaroa - two areas virtually wiped off the map.
""Most of the bodies we have found are not intact and that poses a danger for the rescuers. We have to be very careful to avoid contamination,"" Yusuf Latif, a spokesman for the country's search and rescue effort told the AFP news agency.
""We have vaccinated our teams, but we need to be extra cautious as they are exposed to health hazards. This is also a health concern for the public. It is very hard to control the crowd ... people might be exposed to danger.""
Also on Saturday, passengers faced a long wait at Palu airport due to cancellations, delays and overbooking of commercial flights, according to Al Jazeera's Ted Regencia who was reporting from the disaster-struck region.
Some passengers, with bookings from Friday, were only accommodated by the airlines the following day.
Parts of the city, meanwhile, were trying to return to normality, with some shops and food stalls opening and electricity restored.
In Palu, parks have become refugee camps for those whose houses have been destroyed and have nowhere else to go.
Many are sleeping in the open, waiting for assistance.
""There is still a lack of basic supplies in the affected areas, including here in the heart of Palu city where people have been camping for a week,"" said Al Jazeera's Wayne Hay.
""Despite all the money from the Indonesian government and offers of assistance from foreign governments, no one has been able to supply these people with temporary toilets or adequate shelter,"" he said, reporting from Palu.
Refugees say they are grateful for the land to sleep on, but they need more help.
""I can tell you there are some toilets over there, but they are full of excrement so I eat only once a day so I don't have to go,"" said Haji Ratnawati Tawaka, a Palu resident.
The United Nations has said it is seeking $50.5m ""for immediate relief"" to help victims of the devastating quake and tsunami in Indonesia.
The UN plan, published on Friday and developed in consultation with Indonesian government officials, outlined ""how the humanitarian community working in the country will provide targeted, technical assistance"".
The UN plan aims to provide help to 191,000 people over the next three months, according to a statement by the global body's Indonesia office.
According to UN estimates, 65,000 homes have suffered some form of damage, a figure that includes 10,000 homes ""completely destroyed by the tsunami"" and 15,000 homes severely damaged by the earthquake.
Hundreds of people gathered at Talise beach in Palu on Friday to attend a mass prayer for the victims one week after disaster wreaked havoc in the Muslim island of Sulawesi.
With many of the mosques completely destroyed by tsunami waves, Friday prayers were held outside in different parts of Palu city.
""I hope my dead son has gone to heaven because he was in the middle of praying,"" said Abu Shamsuddin, who attended the weekly prayers in the afternoon outside the damaged Agung Mosque. ""Allah willing, heaven for him. I have faith in that.""
Men in prayer caps sat on prayer mats in an open field, some weeping openly. Others braved the scorching sun as they listened to the mosque's imam encouraging them to be courageous.
Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, Indonesia's disaster management agency spokesman, said about 1,000 people may be buried in areas liquefied by the earthquake in Palu city's Balaroa and Petobo. The areas were swallowed by three-metre deep mud.

Search-and-rescue operations have been hindered because the land is still too wet to manoeuvre on.
So far, only 26 survivors have been found in Petobo and 48 in Balaroa. ""We will continue searching,"" Sutopo said.

In the Palu neighbourhood of Balaroa, about 1,700 houses were buried when the earthquake caused soil to liquefy, the national rescue agency said.
Liquefaction is a phenomenon where saturated sand and silt take on the characteristics of a liquid during the intense shaking of an earthquake.
Among the more than 1,550 people killed in the quake-tsunami were 34 children at a Christian bible study camp that was hit by liquefaction.
A French rescue team using high-tech equipment failed to find anyone alive under the rubble of a hotel in Indonesia's central Sulawesi.
A member of the French organisation, Pompiers de l'urgence, said on Thursday the team's sensors ""detected the presence of a victim"" in the wreckage of the four-star Mercure Hotel in Palu.
The device can pick up breathing and heartbeats, but the team also cautioned that gas leaks and other factors can result in false positives.
On Friday, however, the resucers said no sign of life had been found by the equipment and the team was moving on to other areas.
""Yesterday we had a heart beat and sign of breathing, there were no other movements so it means it was someone who was motionless, confined,"" said Philippe Besson, president of the organisation.
""Today we have no signal.""
Rescue efforts since the September 28 quake have been greatly impeded by a shortage of heavy equipment.
Authorities previously set a tentative deadline of Friday for finding anyone trapped under ruined buildings, although chances of pulling survivors alive from the rubble at such a late stage are almost zero.
Search efforts focused on eight key locations on Friday, including a beach and the Balaroa area where the sheer force of the quake turned the earth temporarily to mush.
""We have to use heavy equipment now because it is very difficult to sift through the rubble by hand,"" Yusuf Latif, a spokesman for Indonesia's search and rescue agency, told AFP news agency.
Local military spokesman Muhammad Thohir said the death toll had risen to 1,558.
Relief efforts kick into full gear
After days of delays, international aid has finally started to arrive in the disaster zone, where the UN says almost 200,000 people are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Survivors have ransacked shops and supply trucks in the hunt for basic necessities, prompting security forces to round up dozens of suspected looters and warn that they were prepared to open fire on thieves.
About 20 planes carrying vital supplies such as tarpaulins, medical equipment and generators are now heading from all over the world to the disaster zone after a long delay.
Indonesia was initially reluctant to accept outside help, insisting its own military could handle the response, but as the scale of the devastation became clearer, President Joko Widodo agreed to allow in foreign aid.
Governments from Australia to Britain are flying in supplies, the United Nations has pledged $15m to the relief effort, and aid groups including Save the Children and the Red Cross are also on the ground.
There were signs of life returning to normal, with children playing in the streets, music blaring out of radios and electricity back up and running in most places.
""Things are improving,"" Azhari Samad, a 56-year-old insurance salesman, told AFP at a mosque in Palu.
But for the area to recover fully from the disaster ""will take years"", he added.
""The first six months will be traumatic, maybe in one year we have some progress. The government will help, people will help from all over the country. Indonesians have a big heart.""
Power was restored and some shops reopened in Indonesia's disaster-stricken city of Palu, The Associated Press said on Thursday.
Traffic lights and televisions flickered back to life in the small city of 370,000 people, which has been the focus of the aid effort launched after last Friday's magnitude 7.5 earthquake and tsunami on the west coast of Sulawesi island.
While international help in searching for survivors has gathered pace, communities in more remote areas have been cut off by damaged roads, landslides and crippled communications.
""There are so many challenges with this disaster, it's never been so bad,"" said Frida Sinta, an aid volunteer trying to get basic food and other supplies out to fellow residents of Palu.
Al Jazeera's Wayne Hay reports from Donggala, the first area hit by the tsunami, that aid has taken time to reach Donggala, as most of the rescue efforts after Friday's devastating disasters focused on Palu City.
""People have been complaining that they are being treated like second-class citizens here because they are not receiving the aid [other] areas have,"" Hay said.
""Slowly but surely, that is improving, the roads to Palu are opening so we are seeing some aid, some assistance, coming through here.
""There is no search and rescuing operation going on, there are still people missing but they assume that these people have now been swept off to sea and will not be seen again.""
Hay added: ""The scene in Donggala is of devastation in the small, peaceful and once-picturesque fishing villages. As the tsunami came through here, it took absolutely everything with it. People's homes, businesses and their livelihood, as the wave swept through here, into the bay towards Palu city itself.
""Officially, the death toll is just over 150 people, relatively low considering the number of people who live here and the size of the wave that came here... That is because a lot of people simply escaped… up onto some pretty high hills...""
At least 600,000 children have been affected by the quake, Save the Children said, with many sleeping on the streets among ruins.
""It's hard to imagine a more frightening situation for a child,"" said Zubedy Koteng, the group's child protection adviser. ""Many children are in shock and traumatised, alone and afraid. Young children searching for surviving relatives will have witnessed and lived through horrific experiences which no child should ever have to see.""
At least 92 people have been arrested for looting in areas devastated by the earthquake.
Local television reported that the people arrested for looting were caught with goods including motor oil, tires, ceramic tiles, and farming equipment. They were from Palu and the surrounding districts struck by the disasters.
Al Jazeera's Ted Regencia, reporting from the Balaroa area in Palu, witnessed a man armed with a katana being arrested by the Indonesian army for stealing motorcycle spare parts.
Indonesia's military said it will shoot looters in the earthquake and tsunami-ravaged province of Sulawesi after desperate survivors emptied shops of food and water.
Signs of desperation are growing with police officers forced to fire warning shots and tear gas to ward off people ransacking businesses. With food and clean water in short supply, survivors are battling thirst and hunger.
""If there is looting again, we will quickly fire a warning shot and then shoot to immobilise,"" Colonel Ida Dewa Agung Hadisaputra told AFP news agency.
According to the UN's humanitarian office, almost 200,000 people need urgent help, among them tens of thousands of children.
Officials on the ground said while the government had invited offers of foreign help, there is still no ""mechanism for this to be implemented"".

International efforts to help survivors of Indonesia's devastating earthquake and tsunami gathered pace on Thursday.
Desperate residents on the west coast of Sulawesi island were scavenging for food in farms and orchards as the government struggled to overcome shortages of water, food, shelter and fuel in a disaster zone with no power and degraded communications.
""The government of Indonesia is experienced and well-equipped in managing natural disasters, but sometimes, as with all other countries, outside help is also needed,"" UN Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator Mark Lowcock said in a statement. He announced an allocation of $15m.
The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies said it was appealing for $22m to help Indonesia.
Some aid from the UK and Australia as also due to arrive on Thursday.
In all, about 20 countries have offered help.
A trickle of emergency aid is only now reaching parts of Sulawesi island and some increasingly desperate survivors are taking matters into their own hands.
Climbing over reeking piles of sodden food and debris, a crowd on Wednesday searched a wrecked warehouse for anything they could salvage: cans of condensed milk, soft drinks, rice, candy and painkillers.
""We came here because we heard there was food,"" Rehanna, a 23-year-old student wearing a red motorcycle helmet, told the Associated Press news agency. ""We need clean water, rice.""
Palu resident Rikardi Safarudin found the house his mother was in when the tsunami hit the small city on Friday.
The house was among those carried hundreds of metres by the waves of mud.
""Looking at all this I know, really, it's impossible she's alive,"" he told Al Jazeera. ""But I can't quite bring myself to give up hope.""
Aeroplanes bringing in aid supplies, humanitarian workers and volunteers from different countries continued to land at the Palu airport late on Wednesday.
""We've seen them arrive with their own cargo of medical assistance and kits that they've brought in,"" said Al Jazeera's Jamila Alindogan, reporting from the Palu airport.
""We're also seeing an influx of forces, presence of the military as signs of reassurance from the government that life can be picked up here again and that security is very much in place,"" she added.
With many areas inaccessible and blocked, machines to clear the debris have also been brought in, Alindogan reported.
""There are areas that remain closed off, where many civilians are still believed to be trapped, and this is a logistical issue,"" she said.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo has said that the evacuation process, cleaning and the search for victims in the quake-hit city of Palu are going according to plan.
On his second visit to the affected area on Wednesday, Widodo stressed that the government wants to ""immediately revive economic activity in markets and shops"".
""The first step is evacuating, after that is rehabilitation and reconstruction,"" he told Al Jazeera's Andrew Thomas in Palu.
During his visit, Widodo scanned different areas of devastation within the city, met some of the evacuees and went to a hospital.
""His presence here signals that the government is in full control,"" said Al Jazeera's Alindogan.
""It is going to be a long process, but the government is basically assuring the people of Indonesia that they are in charge and you can see that just by how things are moving here at the airport,"" she added.
Survivors in Donggala, a region of 300,000 people north of Palu and closer to the epicentre of Friday's earthquake, said they were scavenging for food in farms.
Johnny Lim, a restaurant owner reached by telephone in Donggala town, told Reuters he was surviving on coconuts.
""It's a zombie town. Everything's destroyed. Nothing's left,"" Lim said over a crackling line.
""We're on our last legs. There's no food, no water.""
In another part of Donggala, Ahmad Derajat said survivors were scavenging for food in fields and orchards.
""What we're relying on right now is food from farms and sharing whatever we find like sweet potatoes or bananas,"" said Derajat whose house was swept away by the tsunami, leaving a jumble of furniture, collapsed tin roofs and wooden beams.
""Why aren't they dropping aid by helicopter?"" he asked.
Aid worker Lian Gogali described a perilous situation in Donggala, which includes a string of cut-off, small towns along a coast road north of Palu.
""Everyone is desperate for food and water. There's no food, water, or gasoline. The government is missing,"" Gogali told Reuters.
She added that her aid group had only been able to send in a trickle of rations by motorbike.
The official death toll from the magnitude 7.5 earthquake and tsunami that hit the west coast of Sulawesi island has passed 1,407.
But officials fear the toll could soar, as most of the confirmed dead have come from Palu, a small city 1,500 km northeast of Jakarta and losses in remote areas remain unknown, as communications are down and bridges and roads have been destroyed or blocked by landslides.
A volcano that erupted on Wednesday on disaster-struck Sulawesi island did not cause any additional casualties, Indonesia's National Disaster Agency said.
Mount Soputan, at the northern tip of Sulawesi Island, spewed a massive column of ash more than 6,000 metres into the air, but did not affect any residential areas, said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson for the agency.
""There were no casualties,"" he told reporters in Jakarta. ""The danger zone is only in the radius of four kilometres from the volcano peak. Within the four kilometre radius, there are no residential areas.""
He dismissed concerns that the volcano's eruption could affect planes transporting aid and supplies to the quake disaster areas in and around the city of Palu.
""The volcanic ash from Mt Soputan did not head toward the airport in Palu, so it did not disrupt the airport and evacuation activities there,"" he said.
Residents in one Palu neighbourhood that was devastated by the twin quake-tsunami disaster clapped and cheered in excitement on Wednesday when a truck laden with supplies came in to their area.
""I'm so happy,"" said 63-year-old Heruwanto, while clutching a box of instant noodles.
""I really haven't eaten for three days,"" he told The Associated Press news agency.
Elsewhere in the city, desperate people searched for anything edible in the shell of a warehouse that tsunami waves pounded. People pulled out small cartons of milk, soft drinks, rice, sweets and painkillers from piles of sodden goods.
Andi Arif told AP he was looking for medicine and food for his children.
""There is some aid but we never got it,"" he said, referring to government aid.
More than 25 countries have offered assistance after Indonesian President Joko Widodo appealed for international help. Little of that, however, has reached the disaster zone.
Al Jazeera's Wayne Hay, reporting from the airport at Palu, the largest city heavily damaged by Friday's disaster, said ""there was no shortage of aid coming in"".
""We are seeing medical supplies, food, water and body bags come in. But much of the aid does seem to be sitting at the airport and not getting out fast enough to the areas that need it most,"" he said.
An aircraft carrying 12,000 litres of fuel had arrived, and trucks with food were on the way with police escorts to guard against looters.
Many gas stations were inoperable, either because of quake damage or because of people stealing fuel, national disaster agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said in Jakarta.
Indonesian military chief Hadi Tjahyanto said one armed soldier and one armed police officer would be placed on every aid truck and soldiers would be sent to secure markets, the airport and fuel depots to maintain order.
He added that a Singaporean military transport plane will help evacuate victims from the airport in Palu.
Australia announced it will send 50 medical professionals as part of a $3.6m aid package. The United States and China are among other countries that have offered assistance.
At the quake zone, water is the main issue because most of the supply infrastructure has been damaged, UN deputy spokesman Farhan Haq told reporters at UN headquarters in New York.
Haq said the Indonesian Ministry of Social Affairs has asked the UN children's agency, UNICEF, to send social workers to the affected area to support children who are alone or became separated from their families.
And he said the World Health Organization is warning that a lack of shelter and damaged water sanitation facilities could lead to outbreaks of communicable diseases.
The Indonesia-based ASEAN Coordinating Centre for Humanitarian Assistance said that more body bags were ""urgently"" needed as fears grow that decomposing corpses could provide a breeding ground for deadly diseases.
The death toll has increased to 1,407, according to Indonesia's disaster agency.
Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson for the national disaster agency, said on Wednesday that 519 bodies have been buried as rescue workers scrambled to locate survivors around the ravaged city of Palu.
Underlining the growing sense of urgency, Indonesian President Joko Widodo made his second visit to the disaster zone on Wednesday, putting on an orange hard hat to talk to rescue workers at a collapsed Palu hotel.
""What I've observed after returning now is heavy equipment has arrived, logistics have started to arrive although it's not at maximum yet, fuel has partly arrived,"" Widodo told reporters.
The president called for reinforcements in the search for victims, after inspecting what he called an ""evacuation"" effort at the Hotel Roa Roa, where he said some 30 people lay buried in the ruins.
""We'll continue this process so all the victims can be retrieved,"" he said.
Rescue workers were scrambling on Wednesday to locate survivors around the ravaged seaside city of Palu, with officials saying they are ""racing against time"" to find anyone alive.
Rescuers were focusing on half a dozen key sites around Palu - the Hotel Roa-Roa where up to 60 people are still believed buried, a shopping mall, a restaurant and the Balaroa area where the sheer force of the quake temporarily liquified the earth.
Authorities set a tentative deadline of Friday to find anyone still trapped under the rubble, at which point, the chances of finding survivors will dwindle to almost zero.
At Palu's stricken airport, hundreds of victims were waiting to board Indonesian military transport planes to be evacuated to Makassar, capital of South Sulawesi province. The injured and those with children received priority seating on the Hercules C-130 aircraft.
""The evacuation was orderly and there was no panic. But they obviously looked tired and stressed out,"" Al Jazeera's Ted Regencia reported from the scene.
Outside Palu's Mutiara Al Jufri Airport, hundreds of others were camped out, some receiving medical treatment, others awaiting a chance to escape.
There was mounting concern over Donggala, a region of 300,000 people north of Palu and closer to the epicentre, and two other districts - with a combined population of about 1.4 million.
Initial reports from Red Cross rescuers who reached the outskirts of Donggala district were chilling.
The situation in the affected areas is nightmarish,"" Jan Gelfand, head of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) office in Jakarta, said in a statement.
""The city of Palu has been devastated and first reports out of Donggala indicate that it has also been hit extremely hard by the double disaster.""

More than 14,000 have arrived in Bosnia so far this year, compared to just 755 in 2017. The migrants say they want to seek refuge in Western Europe.
Asim Latic is just one of many Bosnians that have been stepping up, providing humanitarian assistance to migrants stranded in Bosnia, a country that is still recovering from the war and has little resources of its own.
The 63-year-old has provided over 80,000 free meals since he closed his restaurant to locals in February, noticing that many of the refugees and migrants were hungry but had no money to pay for food.
Every day from 11am, 400 to 500 migrants arrive to eat at his restaurant in the small town of Velika Kladusa, by the Croatian border.
""They need help; they have no other option,"" Latic told Al Jazeera. ""In Bosnia, we experienced war for four years. We were hungry, thirsty … children as well. We sympathise with these people. They have nowhere to go. They're looking for a better life.""
Latic provided free meals for the first two and a half months on his own with a team of four friends, relying on donations.
As word spread, more locals arrived, pitching in with food, supplies and donations. Now, the UN Migration Organisation (IOM) supports their initiative.
""They're people who are seeking refuge. They want to work; they want to provide for their families just like us. They aren't people who are looking to create problems,"" Latic said.
A 10-minute walk from Latic's restaurant, Hasan Coragic has invited the fourth refugee family to live in his house.
He had met the Syrian family at the local mosque and was moved when he saw children with them, homeless, with all their belongings in one bag.
""They're in a much more difficult situation than I was [during the war],"" Coragic said. ""I was at least in my own country, but they don't know where to go or what to do. They don't know the language. They only have one bag and nothing else.""
Bosnians have been pitching in across the country.
According to Peter Van der Auweraert, Western Balkans Coordinator for the IOM, the Sarajevo-based NGO Pomozi.ba asked for donations for refugees and migrants for Eid al-Adha and received 80 tonnes of meat from Sarajevo citizens.
""This is absolutely remarkable,"" Van der Auweraert said.
""No matter what the political rhetoric is in the country, there are fundamental European values that are shared across the population and that is something that is quite spectacular.""
Hundreds of refugees and migrants, many of them women and children, have been living in makeshift tents on a field in Velika Kladusa with winter fast approaching.
The Kladusnica river poses an additional problem as it often floods the field following rainfall.
Authorities have not yet agreed where they can accommodate these newcomers.
Danica Jurisic, once a Bosnian minor refugee herself, helped collect 3.5 tonnes of blankets last spring which she shipped to Sarajevo from Paris, with the help of Pomozi.ba. She is currently collecting another 10,000 blankets to send before winter arrives.
For the past three years, she has travelled across Europe, volunteering at migrant and refugee camps in Belgium, France, Italy, Greece and Serbia.
She said nothing could have prepared her for what she witnessed in Bosnia.
""The images from Velika Kladusa are haunting me. It's really worrying,"" Jurisic said, from her home in Paris.
Jurisic was shocked when refugees migrants showed her their injuries and shared stories of being beaten and abused by the Croatian police as they attempted to trek through Croatia and Slovenia.
They also claimed their money and valuables were stolen and their mobile phones damaged beyond repair.
That's why, before embarking on a 20-hour ride to Bosnia from Paris, Jurisic stuffed a suitcase with around 100 power banks for phones, seven smartphones and laptops as well as an odd purple box called ""Jangala"" that provides wifi in humanitarian emergencies, providing internet for about 200 users in a radius of 50 metres.
""We wanted to help those refugees just to try to recover from the violence. I brought several phones with me that were still usable so they can get in touch with their families. They're completely cut off and isolated because they had no access to any kind of devices,"" Jurisic said.
""We wanted to give them a chance to be appreciated.""
I have seen that Bosnia and Herzegovina citizens, whether they are poor, middle-class, rich, whether they are Serbs, Croats or Bosniak - the overwhelming majority responded with solidarity, understanding and humanity.
Peter Van der Auweraert, Western Balkans Coordinator for the IOM
In stark contrast, in September, Josip Tomic, a Croatian Catholic priest living near the Slovenian-Croatian border advised locals against giving refugees and migrants food or water.
On a Facebook page he manages, with a stated goal to ""promote history, Croatian culture, and the Catholic religion"", the priest described men fleeing war and persecution as ""military deserters"" and warned of ""suspicious movements of women and children with the goal of settling in European cultural countries.""
""They are not ready to accept our tradition, customs and culture,"" the priest warned, adding that locals should immediately report unknown people to authorities.
""For 500 years, Croatia was the bulwark of Christianity and a defender of Europe from Islamic heresy. Let's continue this tradition and protect Europe from the invasion of illegal Islamic migration,"" the priest said.
Similarly, Bosnian Serb leader Milorad Dodik stated in May that the arrival of refugees and migrants was part of a conspiracy concocted by a ""hidden Sarajevo structure"" to boost Bosnia's Muslim population, declaring that he refused to have any stationed in Republika Srpska, Bosnia's Serb entity.
Despite political rhetoric, Bosnia's population has responded in its own way.
Van der Auweraert, the IOM coordinator, noted that despite the influx in western Bosnia, no anti-refugee protests have been organised.
""I can tell you, if we would have the same situation in similar towns in Belgium, we would have had extreme right-wing demonstrations against migrants already a long time ago. We haven't seen anything like that in either Velika Kladusa or Bihac,"" he said.
""I have seen that Bosnia and Herzegovina citizens whether they are poor, middle-class, rich, whether they are Serbs, Croats or Bosniak - the overwhelming majority responded with solidarity, understanding and humanity.""
Van der Auweraert recounted a story of how a man, dressed in a suit, drove up in a Porsche Cayenne to the park in Velika Kladusa where refugees and migrants were camping.
He had come with his two children to donate sleeping bags and blankets to show his family what solidarity is.
""In Belgium, someone who drives a Porsche Cayenne doesn't come close to a migrant camp in any sort of way, shape or form,"" Van der Auweraert said.
For Jurisic, the Paris-based volunteer, seeing the refugees on the Bosnian-Croatian border brings up memories of her difficult time.
She recalls escaping her hometown of Sarajevo on May 1, 1992, the last week before Sarajevo was completely sealed off by Serb forces.
Only 16 years old, she managed to cross into Croatia on her own, without any documents, by hopping on a bus that was heading to the coastal city of Split.
Various military groups stopped the bus along the way but fortunately, they weren't turned away.
Although safe from the shelling and sniper attacks in Sarajevo, life was still difficult as a refugee in Croatia.
""When I [arrived in Croatia], people weren't happy with me as a refugee from Sarajevo,"" Jurisic said, adding that she received threats from locals who told her that she was ""contaminated with Muslim culture"".
""I would just like for people to start thinking, not about what is legal and what is documented and who has the papers, but just to remember that we're all people,"" Jurisic said.
""This is not about who is legal or who has the right to cross the border. This is about - are we going to save our humanity? How are we going to react?""

In a letter published Friday addressed to Croatian Prime Minister Andrej Plenkovic, Commissioner Dunja Mijatovic wrote that she was ""worried"" by reports from ""expert refugee and migrant organisations that provide consistent and substantiated information about a large number of collective expulsions from Croatia to Serbia and to Bosnia and Herzegovina of irregular migrants, including potential asylum seekers"".
Particularly worrisome, Mijatovic wrote, were the allegations of systematic violence by Croatian law enforcement officials against those people, including pregnant women and children.
UNHCR has received reports of some 2,500 migrants being pushed back from Croatia since the beginning of 2018, with 1,500 people being denied access to asylum procedures, including over 100 children.
More than 700 people have reported violence and theft by Croatian officers.
""Concerns in this context have also been expressed by the Croatian Ombudswoman, including in her 2017 Annual report, in which she noted, inter alia, that the authorities had not responded to her requests for information about pending investigations into the allegations of police violence against migrants,"" Mijatovic wrote.
Violence carried out by the Croatian police against refugees and migrants has been documented since 2017 by various organisations including Doctors Without Borders, the Red Cross, No Name Kitchen, UNHCR, Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International Slovenia and many others.
However, in a letter also published on Friday, the Croatian Ministry of Interior rejected the Council of Europe’s allegations.
According to Minister of Interior Davor Bozinovic, all reports received by organisations have been examined, but there wasn't enough concrete data for a criminal investigation.
""Up to this point, no cases of coercive means being applied to migrants by police officers have been confirmed. Likewise, the allegations that police officers have committed acts of theft against third-country nationals have not been confirmed either,"" Bozinovic wrote.
Lydia Gall, researcher at Human Rights Watch (HRW), said that HRW welcomed the letter by Commissioner Mijatovic and stated that the rights group has documented numerous cases of violent pushbacks in detail. European Union institutions should make it clear that violent pushbacks contravene EU law, she added.
""No deterrence policy can ever justify acts of indiscriminate violence against migrants and Croatian authorities should ensure these practices stop,"" Gall told Al Jazeera.
""Croatian authorities should also ensure that people are able to exercise their right to seek asylum, regardless of how they entered the country, and have their claims reviewed in a just and fair manner.""
Mijatovic reminded Croatia in the letter that all efforts to manage migration should be aligned with international legal principles, including the absolute prohibition of torture and inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, as well as the prohibition of collective expulsions enshrined in the European Convention on Human Rights.

Nir Barkat on Thursday said schools, clinics and sports centres, among other services operated by the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) in East Jerusalem, will be transferred to Israeli authorities.
The municipality did not provide an exact timeline, but it said schools serving 1,800 students would be closed by the end of the current school year.
Barkat, who is set to step down following municipal elections at the end of the month, said the US decision to cut $300m in aid to the agency earlier this year prompted the move.
""The US decision has created a rare opportunity to replace UNRWA's services with the services of the Jerusalem Municipality,"" he said, accusing the body of operating illegally and promoting incitement against Israel.
""We are putting an end to the lie of the 'Palestinian refugee problem' and the attempts at creating a false sovereignty within a sovereignty,"" Barkat said in a statement, claiming the schools and clinics were illegal and operating without an Israeli license.
UNRWA did not immediately respond to a request for comment by the Associated Press.
UNRWA was established in 1949 after 700,000 Palestinians were forcibly displaced from their homes by Zionist paramilitaries in the run-up to the establishment of the state of Israel.
The agency now provides education, healthcare and social services to more than five million Palestinian refugees in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, as well as Jordan, Lebanon and Syria.
The agency helps more than half of the Gaza Strip's population of two million, devastated by more than 10 years of blockade.
Israel criticises UNRWA for the way it counts the refugees - its total includes the descendants of refugees who were originally displaced by the creation of Israel.
Israel fears that the passing of refugee status from parents to children could threaten the country's so-called ""Jewish character"", as Palestinians claim the right of return to their ancestral homeland.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has accused UNRWA of promoting ""fictitious refugees"", calling for its responsibilities should be taken over by the main UN refugee agency.
The US, meanwhile, has demanded the agency carry out reforms before it restores funding.

""Whenever the Syrian people hold an election, we will leave Syria to its owners,"" Erdogan said at the TRT World forum in Istanbul on Thursday.
Turkey sent troops to Syria in August 2016 to clear a border area of fighters belonging to the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL, also referred to as ISIS).
It launched another operation earlier this year in the northern Syrian enclave of Afrin to remove Kurdish fighters affiliated with the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK).
Erdogan agreed with President Vladimir Putin of Russia last month to establish a ""demilitarised zone"" between rebel and government fighters in northern Syria.
The zone, which will have a depth of 15 to 20km will see groups deemed radical by Moscow withdraw from the area by October 15.
Erdogan added on Thursday that Ankara did not encounter difficulties in conducting talks with various rebel factions in northern Syria's Idlib province, the last major rebel-held stronghold that is outside Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's control.
Hay'et Tahrir al-Sham, which includes the al-Qaeda-linked group formerly known as al-Nusra Front, is believed to be the most powerful armed group in Idlib.
Turkey designated the group a terrorist organisation in August, matching a decision by the United Nations in June.
On Thursday, Erdogan said that in addition to 12 observation points hosted by Turkey in the Idlib region, Russia has 10 and Iran has six.
""Securing this corridor means securing Idlib,"" he said. ""And we have started fortifying our observation posts.""
Since the brutal Syrian civil war began in 2011, some 5.6 million people have fled the country, with as many as 6.6 million others internally displaced, according to the United Nation's refugee agency.
Last week, while addressing the UN General Assembly, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Walid al-Muallem said his country's ""battle against terrorism is almost over"" and that it is now ready to welcome the millions who fled back.
Turkey, which backs opposition fighters seeking to overthrow the Syrian government, fears a large-scale offensive against the rebels could trigger a mass exodus towards its border.
As part of its diplomatic efforts to prevent what the UN fears may be a ""bloodbath"" in Idlib, Turkey has been reaching out to other stakeholder nations.
Later this month, a four-way talk between Turkey, Germany, Russia and France over the Idlib situation is expected to be held after Erdogan made a rare trip to Berlin in September.

Two boats have been detained on Malta, a tiny island off the African coast and smallest member-state of the European Union.

Domenico Lucano, who has been the mayor of the southern Italian town of Riace since 2004, is also accused of unlawful conduct in assigning contracts for rubbish collection services.
Lucano's partner, Tesfahun Lemlem, was banned from living in the town under the same charges.
The arrest on Tuesday morning came amid a government inquiry into the allocation of funds for refugees in the town.
Italy's populist government has adopted a hardline stance on migration controls in recent months.
Lucano has won international acclaim for 'repopulating' Riace with migrants and successfully integrating the arrivals.
With a population of about 1,500, the town hosts around 500 migrants and refugees from more than 20 countries.
Like other small towns across Italy, it has witnessed the massive flight of young people in recent decades, who left looking for economic opportunities elsewhere.
Lucano's model gained international attention at the peak of the refugee crisis in 2015 and he made Fortune Magazine's 50 greatest leaders list in 2016.
Refugees and migrants in Italy are usually hosted in reception centres, most of them privately run but publicly funded, with strict rules and timetables guests have to follow.
These rules and the centres' locations, often far from city centres, have made it difficult for refugees and asylum seekers to integrate and hold down a job.
In Riace, they have been given homes left empty by former residents. They also have the opportunity to work through a programme that has created employment among both refugees and locals - the first focused on cultural mediation and local craftsmanship and the second on language teaching.
The investigation against Lucano began in November last year. Prosecutors said in a note that ""it brought to light the unscrupulousness of Mr Lucano, despite his institutional role, in organising 'weddings of convenience' between Riace citizens and foreign women, with the ultimate aim to facilitate the latter's stay in Italy.""
Authorities wiretapped a conversation between the mayor and his partner where he talked about ways to help a Nigerian woman who had been denied a stay permit three times.
""It seems to me there are a number of irregularities in that supposed model,"" Italy's right-wing interior minister Matteo Salvini stated in late August, after anti-mafia writer Roberto Saviano, an outspoken supporter of the mayor's work, called for him to visit Riace.
""I have been and I will go back to [the Calabria region] to visit all those mayors who work for Italian people, and not for the immigration business,"" Salvini said.
In a Facebook post after Lucano's arrest on Tuesday, Saviano wrote: ""the goal of Mimmo [Domenico] Lucano's actions is not profit, but civil disobedience.""
""Civil disobedience: this is the only weapon we have to defend not only the rights of migrants, but everyone's,"" argued the author, concluding that the investigation is ""the first step towards Italy's definitive transformation from democracy to an authoritarian state.""
A number of civil society organisations have expressed concern about the arrest, which they see as yet another attack by a government that has built its popularity partly on anti-migrant rhetoric.
""It started with NGOs saving lives at sea. Now it's the turn of those who do it on land,"" wrote Naples-based anti-racism group Associazione 3 Febbraio in a statement calling for solidarity with the mayor.
For Leonardo Neglia, the mayor of Petralia Sottana, a town near Palermo with less than 3,000 residents, Lucano's reception model is one to replicate.
Neglia had considered starting a similar project in Petralia Sottana, although the idea has been put on hold after the government's 'migration and security' decree.
""Beyond technical and juridical considerations, I think his reception model should be recreated in other municipalities,"" he told Al Jazeera.
""We were looking for people who would be willing to make their empty homes in the city centre available for the project. There are many, due to the depopulation of our towns as many young people leave, creating a vicious circle of impoverishment,"" Neglia added.
""But this [arrest] sends a message that times have changed.""

Al Kontar, 37, had been living inside KLIA's domestic transfer lounge since March, after being denied entry to Cambodia and sent back to Malaysia.
The Syrian refused to seek asylum in Malaysia and decided to remain at the airport. Many view this move as a protest against Malaysia's arbitrary detention of refugees and it not being a signatory to the UN Refugee Convention.
Al Kontar turned to social media to share his story of a life in limbo.
He first arrived in Malaysia in October 2017 after being deported from the United Arab Emirates, where he had lived for 11 years, avoiding Syria's devastating war and compulsory military service.
Al Kontar pleaded with UAE authorities to be sent to Malaysia, one of the few countries that allow Syrians to obtain visas on arrival.
He overstayed his Malaysian tourist visa last March and paid a penalty fee before attempting to depart. Then Al Kontar ended up at KLIA terminal two domestic transfer lounge, where he spent the last six months looking for options.
A group of Canadian volunteers filed a refugee sponsorship application to Canada on Al Kontar's behalf on April 25, 2018. The processing time for a refugee application to Canada is 23 months and there is no guarantee he will be accepted.
Canada Caring Society started an online petition to call on Canadian Minister of Immigration Ahmed Hussen to allow Al Kontar to go to Canada on humanitarian grounds until his refugee application can be processed.
Al Kontar has family in Canada and friends and supporters there have found him a job. His Syrian passport expires in January 2019.
Malaysian police transferred Al Kontar to the immigration department. It stated it would contact the Syria embassy to facilitate his deportation from Malaysia.
The UN refugee agency's Malaysia office is aware of Al Kontar's arrest but has been unable to comment on specific cases.
Supporters inside Malaysia fear he will be placed in immigration detention until deportation, where conditions have been referred to as ""torture-like"" by SUHAKAM, Malaysia's human rights commission.
Al Kontar's Canadian lawyer Andrew Brouwer was unavailable for comment.

Helena Maleno, a Morocco-based activist with Spanish NGO Caminando Fronteras, said on Tuesday that 34 of a total of 60 migrants died after authorities failed to respond to earlier reports of the incident.
TRAGEDIA 📢 34 muertos, entre ellos un bebé, de la patera con 60 personas que antes de ayer se hundía frente a Marruecos. 24 horas estuvieron pidiendo auxilio y les dejaron morir lentamente. #FronteraSur
""They had been asking for help for the past 24 hours but we let them die slowly,"" she posted on Twitter.
Joe Millman, a spokesperson of the International Organization for Migration (IOM), told Reuters news agency that ""the boat was adrift since Sunday with 60 people on board. At least 34 people have drowned, it looks like there were 26 survivors.""
A Moroccan official who wished to remain anonymous told Reuters that 11 bodies had been recovered so far, adding that none of the deceased were Moroccan nationals.
For the first time since the refugee crisis began in 2015, the Morocco to Spain route has become the most popular path for asylum seekers attempting to reach Europe's shores.
Up until September 10 this year, a total of 34,994 people made the perilous journey, dwarfing numbers for the Libya-Italy and Turkey-Greece routes with 20,210 and 20,827 respectively. This figure is also already treble that of 2017.
According to some reports, Moroccan authorities believe 50,000 migrants and refugees are currently based in Tangier and its surrounding area.

In a statement, the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) said it has ""decided to temporarily withdraw part of its international staff from Gaza following a series of worrying security incidents affecting its personnel in the strip.""
A source with the agency said around 10 staff members crossed into Israel from the Gaza Strip on Monday, amid reports of harassment in relation to job cuts.
An UNRWA source said a protest was held Monday outside a Gaza City hotel where agency officials were meeting.
The agency's statement said that ""earlier today, a number of staff were harassed and prevented from carrying out their duties"".
""Some of these actions have specifically targeted the UNRWA management in Gaza,"" it said.
Hani al-Omari, a local UNRWA employee, told Reuters news agency that dozens of people whose jobs were recently cut or reduced had gathered outside a hotel where they heard UNRWA international staff were meeting, some surrounding the vehicle of one of them.
""We wanted to send a message to them that they will not be comfortable while they plan to execute us by cutting our jobs,” al-Omari said.
UNRWA in its statement called on Gaza authorities to ""provide effective protection to its employees and facilities"".
Gaza is controlled by the Hamas movement.
Eyad al-Bozom, spokesman for the Hamas-led interior ministry in Gaza, said the ministry was committed to the protection of UNRWA's staff and facilities.
""The protection measures did not change, but due to the recent job reductions in the Gaza Strip, there has been anger among the employees. We will not let these protests develop and we will not allow any attacks against employees or facilities,” he said.
In August, the United States announced it would stop funding the UN body, which services five million Palestinian refugees in the occupied West Bank, Gaza Strip, Lebanon, Jordan and Syria. Most of the refugees are descendants of the 700,000 Palestinians who were forcibly displaced from their homes by Zionist paramilitaries in 1948.
US State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert called UNRWA an ""irredeemably flawed operation.""
The US had been the agency's largest contributor by far, providing it with $350m annually - roughly a quarter of its overall budget.
The Trump administration's decision to cancel all aid to the agency has led to job cuts at UNRWA programmes across the occupied West Bank and the Gaza Strip.
According to the UNRWA employees' union, funding cuts have forced the agency to close its mental health programme, which provided direct services to Palestinian refugees in Gaza and had employed about 430 people.
Palestinians have protested the cuts on a near-daily basis since they were announced, saying that the UN has a responsibility to act and ensure that operations continue.
Last week, tens of thousands of students enrolled in UNRWA schools in the occupied West Bank went on strike, citing their concern over whether their schools would have enough funds to function until the end of the academic year.
On Monday, dozens of Palestinians staged a rally outside the office of the UN refugee agency in occupied East Jerusalem.
Among the leading participants were Archbishop Atallah Hanna and Sheikh Ikrema Sabri, an imam of al-Aqsa Mosque.
The protesters handed over a message to the UNRWA operations director, in which they ""highlighted the UN responsibility and historic role towards the Palestinian issue"".
The message cited UN General Assembly resolution 302 that calls for the provision of services to refugees by UNRWA until reaching a just settlement to the issue of Palestinian refugees.
Participants also appealed to international donors to increase their funding to the UN refugee agency ""to guarantee UNRWA to continue to do its role"".

An influential figure in Stockholm's cultural scene, 72-year-old Jean-Claude Arnault went on trial last month on two counts of rape relating to incidents dating back to 2011.
In a unanimous ruling, the Stockholm District Court on Monday found Arnault guilty of one of the charges while acquitting him of the other.
""The defendant is found guilty of rape committed during the night between the 5th and 6th of October 2011 and has been sentenced to imprisonment for two years,"" a court statement said.
""The injured party has been awarded compensation for damages,"" it added.
Prosecutors had called for a minimum sentence of three years in what was one of the first big trials to come out of the #MeToo movement.
Arnault's conviction came minutes before the academy announced American James Allison and Japanese Tasuku Honjo as winners of this year's Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine.
Arnault is married to poet Katarina Frostenson, a member of the Swedish Academy, which awards the Nobel Literature Prize.
The revelation of the scandal prompted the cancellation of this year's Nobel prize for literature - a first in 70 years - and saw seven members of the academy either being forced to leave or quitting in April, including Frostenson.
The scandal erupted in November 2017, a month after rape and sexual abuse accusations surfaced against Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein.
At the time, Swedish daily Dagens Nyheter published the testimonies of 18 women claiming to have been raped, sexually assaulted or harassed by Arnault. The Frenchman also ran the Forum club, a meeting place for the cultural elite and popular among aspiring young authors hoping to make contact with publishers and writers.
The two counts of rape involved one woman. According to the prosecution, Arnault allegedly forced the woman - who was in a state of ""intense fear"" - to have oral sex and intercourse in a Stockholm apartment on October 5, 2011. He was also accused of raping her during the night of December 2-3 the same year while she was asleep, but was acquitted on that charge. The trial was heard behind closed doors to protect the victim, whose identity has not been disclosed.
In Sweden, rape is punishable by a minimum of two years and a maximum of six years in prison.
Arnault has maintained his innocence from the start. He has been held in preventive custody since the end of his trial on September 24 and will remain in jail until the formal start of his sentence, the court said. His accusers claim the Swedish Academy was well aware of his behaviour, and blame the institution for helping create a ""culture of silence"" that pervaded Sweden's cultural circles. An internal Academy probe had concluded there were conflicts of interest between Arnault and the Academy, and found that several female Academy members and people close to them had also been harassed or assaulted by the Frenchman. According to Swedish daily Svenska Dagbladet, Arnault was born in Marseille in 1946 to Russian refugee parents. He arrived in Sweden in the late 1960s to study photography. He had bragged about being the ""19th member"" of the Academy, and according to the internal probe, he leaked the names of Nobel literature laureates on several occasions.

The migrants, including Libyans, sub-Saharan Africans and Afghans, boarded two buses at a Malta Armed Forces base in Valletta on Sunday after being transferred from the Aquarius to a Maltese patrol boat in international waters.
""All migrants who disembarked in Malta will be transferred to four other European countries in the coming days,"" the Government of Malta said in a statement.
The migrants include a five-month pregnant woman and Bella the dog, the first animal rescued with migrants in the Mediterranean and they are to be sent on to four European countries after a tense standoff over their fate last week.

The UN refugee agency UNHCR said that it had not yet been decided where which of the migrants - 18 children, 17 women, 23 men and a dog - would go.
""We hope that they will leave Malta in a few days,"" UNHCR representative Paolo Biondi told AFP news agency at the base.
France has agreed to take 18 of the migrants, Germany and Spain 15 each and Portugal 10.
""The de-registration of the Aquarius is deeply worrying and would represent a dramatic reduction of search and rescue capacity at precisely the moment when it needs to be stepped up,"" the UNHCR statement added.
Panama pulled its flag from the ship a week ago, meaning the unregistered Aquarius would not be able to leave any port, while other rescue vessels already impounded in Valletta fight a protracted legal battle.
Italy convinces Panama to revoke the flag of the rescue ship Aquarius, effectively stopping it and making it more likely that migrants will drown in the Mediterranean. Italy also illegally restricts the rights of asylum seekers who make it to its shores. https://t.co/x2qua4NCv2 pic.twitter.com/F9NeIxKVVo
The group were picked up from two boats plying the perilous route between North Africa and Europe last Monday.
The Aquarius, chartered by Doctors Without Borders (MSF) and SOS Mediterranee, is the only civilian ship still trying to rescue migrants making the perilous journey from North Africa to Europe.
""After five days waiting at sea near Malta, this morning all 58 rescued people on board the Aquarius will be transferred to the Maltese maritime authorities for disembarkation in Malta,"" MSF wrote on Twitter.

In the morning session, India and Pakistan traded blows over disputed Kashmir, while an envoy from war-torn Syria took to the stage to defend his country's sovereignty and announce that the country's bloody seven-year-long conflict was ""almost over"".
Later, North Korea asked the US for less sanctions and more understanding, while the Philippines slid a justification for alleged human rights abuses into a hopeful, upbeat speech centering on global citizenship.
Follow live updates:
Bahrain's Shaikh Khalid bin Ahmed al-Khalifa used his address to slam Iran for attempting to overthrow states and interfering in the affairs of neighbouring countries.
The foreign minister repeatedly decried Iran's foreign policy, including in Yemen and Morocco, saying that the Islamic Republic is attempting to export its ideals.
The views were echoed by Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed al-Nahyan, the UAE's foreign minister, who accused Iran of spreading ""chaos, violence and sectarianism"" and of occupying three islands he says belong to the UAE.
Bahrain and the UAE are two of four countries currently engaged in a blockade against Qatar and both envoys justified the action during their speeches as a means of ensuring security in the Middle East, with al-Nahyan calling the embargo ""vital and decisive"" in persuading Qatar to cease its alleged support of armed groups.
Both Bahrain and the UAE praised a recent peace deal between Eritrea and Ethiopia, reiterated their commitments to resolving the conflict in Yemen and pledged continued support to the Palestinians.
Pakistani Foreign Minister Makhdoom Shah Mahmood Hussain Qureshi hit back at claims made by India earlier in the session that it harbours ""terrorists"", charging its neighbour with the same accusation.
He accused India of perpetrating ""state-sponsored terrorism"" in disputed Kashmir, calling alleged human rights abuses by Indian forces a ""blot on the conscience of humanity"".
Qureshi dismissed India's cancellation of talks on ""flimsy"" grounds, saying the country was putting politics over peace.
Qureshi claimed Pakistan had undertaken the ""largest and most effective"" counterterrorism campaign in the world and praised China's Belt and Road initiative as a means of preventing terrorism through development.
Qureshi also said his country had shown a ""fundamental shift in paradigm of governance"" by electing Imran Khan as Prime Minister in July and are focused on pursuing a policy of ""peace, partnerships and prosperity"" in the region and internationality.
A fleeting mention of President Rodrigo Duterte's war on drugs was sandwiched between hopeful messages about global citizenship and the value of loving ""thy neighbour"" in a sermon-like address by Alan Peter Cayetano.
The Filipino secretary for foreign affairs said Duterte's efforts had ensured the Philippines was no longer on the road to becoming a narco state and that, while the human rights of each and every person in the Philippines were to be respected, if forced to choose between a law-abiding citizen or law enforcer and a drug dealer, they would always choose the former.
""Which country, which leader wouldn't do the same?,"" he said.
North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho praised the ""tangible trend of peace and development"" seen in the Korea Peninsula since diplomatic ties between North and South Korea were rekindled.
Ri ascribed this progress almost entirely to efforts by the Koreas, saying the US continued to damage the peace protest by mistrusting North Korea.
Frequently reemphasising the need for trust, Ri said there was ""no way"" North Korea would unilaterally disarm themselves before ""coercive"" sanctions were lifted, adding that the idea that sanctions would bring North Korea to its knees is a ""pipe dream"" of those who don't understand the country.
Ri called for the implementation of the agreements made between the US and North Korea at the Singapore summit, saying the UN should do more to support the peace talks, which will allow ""the hottest spot in the globe [to] become the cradle of peace and prosperity"".
A muted applause greeted Syrian Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Walid al-Moallem as he took to the podium.
Al-Moallem took the opportunity to decry international interference in domestic Syrian affairs, framing the country's brutal seven-year-long civil war as a battle against ""terrorism"".
In a damming speech, al-Moallem accused the US coalition of war crimes, including massacres of civilians and said that countries which had not supported Bashar al-Assad's goverment would not be welcome to take part in rebuilding Syria.
Al-Moallem condemned all use of chemical weapons, saying Syria has eliminated it's chemical programme ""completely"".
According to al-Moallem, everything is in place to allow refugees to return voluntarily. Now that Syria's ""battle against terrorism is almost over"".
Sushma Swaraj, India's foreign minister, used the address to praise developments under Prime Minister Narendra Modi and slam neighbouring Pakistan for supporting ""terrorism"".
Without mentioning Kashmir by name, Swaraj made several references to ""terrorism"" in the disputed region.
Swaraj blamed Pakistan for the breakdown of peace talks, saying that each time both sides had agreed to a dialogue, Pakistani-backed attacks had forced India to withdraw.
Accusing Pakistan of ""verbal duplicity,"" she noted that Osama bin Laden was found living there after 9/11 and said that the mastermind behind the 2008 attack on a Mumbai hotel ""still roams the streets of Pakistan with impunity"".
Swaraj also took time to list progress that has been made under Modi, including the country's maternity benefit scheme, which allows women to take 26 weeks of paid leave.
Swaraj and her Pakistani counterpart were due to meet on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly this week, but India called it off only one day after it was announced, following the killing of an Indian border guard in Kashmir.
Pakistans foreign minister is due to speak later today.
Envoys from two of the world's most troubled countries are set to have their say before the world body.
North Korea and Syria will take to the stage during morning session, along with representatives from India, Pakistan, and several Gulf states.
Syria's Foreign Minister Walid al-Moallem will take the podium as his government is firmly in control of most of the territory that opposition forces held for much of his country's seven-year conflict.
A military offensive on Idlib - the last remaining rebel-held region in Syria - was averted last week by a deal reached between Russia and Turkey to set up a demilitarised zone along the western, southern and eastern reaches of the province.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov denounced what he said are ""baseless accusations"" of Russian interference in foreign affairs and lashed out at US policies in Iran, Syria and Venezuela.
Lavrov used Russia's speech at the annual UN General Assembly to vigorously defend multilateral organisations like the United Nations and warn against unilateral moves by the US or other countries.
Lavrov accused unnamed forces of ""endeavors to undermine democratically elected governments,"" in an apparent reference to US and EU support for Russia's neighbours and the Syrian opposition.
Russia has denied widespread evidence tying it to meddling in the 2016 US election, a nerve agent attack in Britain and other actions abroad.
Greece is using its address to world leaders to chastise some European neighbors for turning their backs on refugees and migrants who continue to pour into Europe by land and by sea.
Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras said on Friday that Greece is dealing with the highest refugee flows since World War II and notes that Greeks have ""opened their arms to incoming migrants, showing the world what solidarity means.""
He said Greeks did not ""give in to nationalistic and xenophobic voices that called for pushback in the sea or a superficial asylum process aimed at rejecting everyone.""
Most refugees and migrants land in Italy and Greece and those countries feel abandoned by their EU partners.
Member states like Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovakia are unwilling to share the burden and refuse to accept refugee quotas.
Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad is criticising growing political, economic and social turmoil around the world, saying the situation has only worsened since the start of the century.
The 93-year-old Mahathir told the UN General Assembly on Friday that when he last spoke to the forum in 2003, shortly before retiring, ""I lamented how the world had lost its way.""
Mahathir returned to politics this year and says that ""if at all, the world is far worse than 15 years ago.""
He cites the trade fight between China and the United States, saying that ""the rest of the world is feeling the pain.""
And he criticises the government of Myanmar for its treatment of its Rohingya Muslim minority and accuses the rest of the world of failing to act.
Mahathir asked fellow leaders: ""Nations are independent, but does this mean that they have a right to massacre their own people?""
The UN's deputy humanitarian chief said Myanmar has not ""substantively and concretely"" addressed the issues that led more than 725,000 Rohingya Muslims to flee, and therefore conditions aren't right for their repatriation from Bangladesh.
Ursula Mueller told a high-level event at the UN General Assembly's ministerial meeting on Thursday that the government ""must take real steps forward, clearly demonstrating a commitment to immediate change on the ground.""
In her speech, circulated on Friday, Mueller said the Rohingya are now ""the world's largest stateless population.""
She urged donors to respond to the refugee crisis, stressing that the appeal for Bangladesh is only 38 percent funded.
Mueller also urged Myanmar's government to dismantle segregated facilities for the roughly 600,000 Rohingya who remain in Myanmar and end the marginalisation and ""deplorable conditions"" many are forced to live in.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said on Thursday that steps by North Korea towards gradual disarmament should be followed by the easing of sanctions against Pyongyang.
Lavrov's proposal at the UN Security Council meeting challenges US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's demand that sanctions should be ""vigorously"" enforced until such time that North Korea denuclearises.
Russia's top diplomat also called on other countries to refrain from imposing ""unacceptable"" secondary sanctions on North Korea while talks continue.
Earlier, Pompeo said that North Korea has already breached the cap on refined petroleum set by the UN Security Council last year.
UN restrictions allow Pyongyang to import 500,000 barrels a year, but between January and September, the rogue nuclear nation has already obtained around 800,000 barrels, according to US estimates.
US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said that the only path for North Korea through diplomacy and denuclearisation.
Pompeo said during the UN Security Council meeting that any other path will lead to isolation and pressure. He added that sanctions will be ""vigorously"" enforced until such time that North Korea will denuclearise.
On Wednesday, Pompeo announced that he would travel to Pyongyang in October to make preparations for a second summit between US President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un.
New Zealand's prime minister is highlighting gender gaps in pay and domestic violence as continuing problems as she calls for the world to ""recommit ourselves to gender equality.""
Jacinda Ardern, her country's third female prime minister, was speaking on the third day of debate at the United Nations General Assembly.
She said she never grew up believing that gender would stand in the way of her achievements. But she said she will ""never celebrate the gains we have made"" for women in New Zealand while women in other nations lack ""the most basic of opportunity and dignity.""
Ardern's remarks Thursday also called for a recommitment to multilateralism — both on principle and because, as she said, ""In New Zealand, going alone is not an option.""
And she said that climate change is an important example of why cooperation is imperative.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu opened his speech before the UN General Assembly on Thursday by assailing the 2015 Iran nuclear deal as a ""fundamental lie"" and accusing Tehran of concealing materials to develop a weapons programme.
""We opposed it because it threatens our future, even our very survival. We opposed it because the deal was based on a fundamental lie that Iran is not seeking to develop nuclear weapons,"" he said.
Netanyahu then repeated his allegations that Iran continues to pursue its nuclear weapons programme, based on the documents that Israel stole from a government warehouse in Tehran in February.
He also criticised UN nuclear inspectors for not carrying out more inspections on an alleged ""secret atomic warehouse"" that Iran continues to hide from the public.
""The reason Iran did not destroy its atomic archive and its atomic warehouse is because it hasn't abandoned its goal to develop nuclear weapons,"" he said.
""Israel will never let a regime that calls for our destruction to develop nuclear weapons,"" he said while accusing European signatories of the nuclear deal of ""appeasing"" Iran.
""Jerusalem is not for sale,"" Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas declared on Thursday as he denounced US President Donald Trump's decision to recognise Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and to move the US embassy there.
In a speech before the UN General Assembly, Abbas called on Trump to rescind that decision, as well as his move to cut financial aid to the Palestinians, saying they undermined the two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
""With all of these decisions, this administration has reneged on all previous US commitments, and has undermined the two-state solution,"" Abbas said.
He also criticised Israel for promoting ""apartheid"" by passing in July the ""racist"" Jewish nation-state law, which he said ""crossed all the red lines"".
""This law will inevitably lead to the creation of one racist state, an apartheid state and thus nullifies the two-state solution,"" he said.
In his speech, Abbas also urged the UN-backed International Criminal Court to investigate alleged crimes by Israel.
Israeli Defence Minister Avigdor Lieberman expressed indifference on Thursday to US President Donald Trump's remarks about a two-state solution, saying that the Israeli interest is ""a safe Jewish state.
Lieberman said a Palestinian state ""simply doesn't interest me.""
He made the remarks just hours ahead of the speeches of Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
On Wednesday, Netanyahu met with Trump, during which the US president said that he ""liked"" a two-state solution as the most effective way to resolve the Palestinian-Israeli conflict.
Iran's president said on Thursday that the UN Security Council meeting chaired by President Donald Trump the previous day reflected America's increasing isolation among the international community.
""Nobody backed the United States, putting America into a unique historical and political isolation,"" said Hassan Rouhani, speaking to reporters at Tehran's airport after returning from New York, where he addressed the UN General Assembly.
According to the Iranian leader, Trump achieved the opposite of what he'd hoped for -- in the Security Council meeting, 14 countries either directly or indirectly backed the nuclear agreement between Iran, the United States and five other major powers.
""Very interesting, someone invites leaders to a UN Security Council meeting after himself having trampled on a resolution by the very same council,"" Rouhani said, referring to the council resolution that backed the landmark 2015 nuclear deal. [AP]
Iranian President Hassan Rouhani on Wednesday urged President Donald Trump to ""stop bullying"" Tehran into submitting into the demands of the US.
In a press conference with Western media, Rouhani also said it is ""clear"" during his meeting with world leaders at the sidelines of the UN General Assembly, that Trump's decision to withdraw from the nuclear deal has ""isolated"" the US.
""The US decision to withdraw from the nuclear deal was not agreed upon by other parties. It is considered a mistake by other countries,"" Rouhani said in an unprecedented press conference with Western media.
""One day, sooner or later, the US will return to the nuclear deal. The US cannot continue this process. This is not in the interest of the US, Iran and other parties,"" he said, adding that it was Iran's intention ""to try to isolate the US on this issue of the nuclear deal.""
What Iran wants is for the US to ""return to what is legal and stand by the UN Security Council resolution"" on the nuclear deal, and ""stop bullying"" his country, Rouhani said.
Earlier on Wednesday, Rouhani's foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif referred to the reimposition of US sanctions as an act of ""unprecedented vengeance"".
Zarif said the US withdrawal from the nuclear deal is ""unlawful and unjustified"".
Venezuela's president has said at the UN General Assembly that he objects to US President Donald Trump's actions against his government and says that the ""illegal unilateral sanctions"" are part of a bullying tactic of the United States ""imposing its will"".
Nicolas Maduro has spent the majority of his speech upbraiding Trump for what the Venezuelan leader calls unfair and imperialist policies and practices.
He said that Trump's speech to the General Assembly about more unilateral, America-first policies constituted ""a threat"".
Afghanistan's chief executive told world leaders on Wednesday that his country has ""turned a page"" toward peace in the last year, and he's calling for their help in getting to ""a new phase free of violence"" in a country riven by conflict since the 1970s.
Speaking at the UN General Assembly, Abdullah Abdullah pointed to developments including the Taliban's participation in a brief ceasefire in June.
He said Afghans ""pose no danger to anyone"" and seek to ""play a constructive and collaborative role"" regionally.
The UN envoy for Afghanistan recently said the country is in its best position since 2001 to start a process leading to peace talks with Taliban armed fighters.
Still, attacks this year have underscored the difficulties Afghan forces have faced in combatting the Taliban and an affiliate of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL).
With US President Donald Trump listening, Bolivia's President Evo Morales lashed out at the United States and accused Trump's administration of meddling in Iran and Venezuela.
Morales also said the US government has shown ""contempt"" for multilateralism and has no interest in upholding democracy.
Trump was presiding over a UN Security Council meeting on Wednesday.
Morales said that if the US upheld democracy ""it would not have financed coup d'etats and supported dictators"" or threatened democratically elected governments as it has in Venezuela.
He also charged that ""the United States could not care less about human rights or justice,"" citing its alleged promotion of the ""use of torture"" and separation of migrant parents and children who were put ""in cages.""
Trump made no comment when Morales finished. [AP]
Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi on Wednesday dismissed the claim of US President Donald Trump that Beijing is trying to influence the outcome of the midterm US elections in November.
In his statement before the UN Security Council, Wang said that it is China's long-standing policy ""of non-interference of the domestic affairs of other countries"".
""This is a tradition of Chinese foreign policy. Our observance of this principle has received acclaim in the international community. We did not and will never interfere in any country's domestic affairs. We refuse to accept in unwarranted accusations against China, and we call upon other countries to also observe the purposes of the UN charter not to interference with other country's domestic affairs"".
Meanwhile, Wang also defended the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, praising it as an ""achievement of multilateralism"".
""There is no international agreement that is perfect. The JCPOA has been unanimously endorsed by the Security Council. What happened in the past three years shows the JCPOA is a viable agreement,"" he said, referring to the deal, officially known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA).
Wang urged Iran to ""continue to fulfil"" its commitment to the deal, adding that ""legitimate rights"" of other countries to trade with Iran ""should be respected"".
He also praised the progress being made in the Korean Peninsula and expressed its support of the agreement reached between US President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in Singapore in June.
""We call on all parties to seize the opportunities into concrete actions.""
US President Donald Trump has accused China of seeking to meddle in the November 6 midterm elections, saying Beijing did not want the Republican Party to do well because of his stance on trade.
""China has been attempting to interfere in our upcoming 2018 election, coming up in November. Against my administration,"" Trump told the UN Security Council meeting on Wednesday.
Trump did not provide any evidence for the allegation. China did not immediately respond to the remarks by Trump, who was chairing the Council meeting.
""They do not want me or us to win, because I am the first president ever to challenge China on trade and we are winning on trade, we are winning at every level. We don't want them to meddle or interfere in our upcoming election,"" Trump said. [Reuters]
French President Emanuel Macron on Wednesday said that a ""serious crisis of confidence"" has emerged after US President Donald Trump's decision to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal.
In his message before the UN Security Council, Macron said that while the 2015 deal is ""imperfect"", it ensures that Iran would not be able to obtain nuclear weapons.
Since the deal was signed, the ""pathways of the signatories of the JCPOA have diverged...but we still, all of us here, retain the same objective of preventing Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons, and guaranteeing strict international control on the peaceful use of their nuclear programme"".
US President Donald Trump on Wednesday focused his address at the UN Security Council, telling world leaders that the US will ensure that Iran will never acquire a nuclear bomb.
""The Iranian regime exports violence, terror and turmoil,"" he said, accusing Tehran of procuring materials to advance its ballistic missile programme.
""A regime with this track record must never be allowed to possess a nuclear weapon,"" Trump said, as he justified his decision to withdraw from the 2015 nuclear deal and to reimpose economic sanctions.
Trump said that the deal allowed Iran ""to continue its path towards a bomb"" and gave Iran a ""cash lifeline when they needed it the most"".
But Trump also thanked Iran, Russia and Syria for ""substantially slowing down"" their attack on the rebel-held province of Idlib.
All options are on the table with regards to Venezuela, US President Donald Trump said on Wednesday in New York, a day after his administration ratcheted up sanctions on the inner circle of President Nicolas Maduro.
""All options are on the table. Every one. The strong onesáand the less than strong ones. Every option. And you know what I mean by strong. Every option is on the table with respect to Venezuela,"" Trump said.
Trump called for the restoration of democracy in Venezuela during a speech to the UN General Assembly on Tuesday, shortly after his government slapped sanctions on key figures in Caracas, including Maduro's wife.
US President Donald Trump will chair the UN Security Council meeting on weapons of mass destruction. North Korea's foreign minister, unexpectedly, joined the meeting along with his Chinese counterpart.
Trump said after a meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that he wants a ""two-state solution"" in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
Germany and Saudi Arabia have agreed to end a prolonged diplomatic row that prompted the kingdom to pull its ambassador from Berlin and punish German firms operating in the country.
The spat was triggered last November when Germany's foreign minister at the time, Sigmar Gabriel, condemned ""adventurism"" in the Middle East, in comments that were widely seen as an attack on increasingly assertive Saudi policies, notably in Yemen.
The comments led Riyadh to withdraw its ambassador and freeze out German companies, particularly in the lucrative healthcare sector.
Standing alongside his Saudi counterpart Adel al-Jubeir at the United Nations on Tuesday, German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas spoke of ""misunderstandings"" that had undermined what were otherwise ""strong and strategic ties"" between the countries, saying ""we sincerely regret this"".
""We'll do our best to make this partnership with the kingdom even stronger than before,"" he added.
Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said on Tuesday that world security is under threat by some states' ""recklessness and disregard"" of international values and institutions.
""Confronting multilateralism is not a sign of strength. Rather, it is a symptom of the weakness of the intellect. It betrays an inability in understanding a complex and interconnected world,"" he said.
Rouhani said that it is ""unfortunate"" that the world is witnessing rulers ""who think they can secure their interest better...by fomenting extremist, nationalism and through xenophobic tendencies resembling Nazi disposition.""
In his speech, Rouhani also lashed out at US President Donald Trump, saying he is seeking an ""overthrow"" of the Iranian leadership, while calling the unilateral US sanctions as a form of ""economic terrorism"".
Qatar's leader Sheikh Tamim called on the UN General Assembly on Tuesday to reject ""the rule of force"" to resolve political and security disputes in the world and the Middle East.
It is the second time that Sheikh Tamim addressed the UN meeting since the Saudi Arabia-led blockade of the Gulf state in 2017, which he said is a ""flagrant violation"" of international law.
In his speech, Tamim said that since the blockade started, it has been revealed that there was a ""pre-arranged campaign of incitement"" against his country. But he said that during the same period of the blockade, Qatar's economy continued its growth.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has called on all parties to support ""just and sustainable political solution"" in Syria with a constructive approach, to prevent a humanitarian catastrophe.
Last week, Turkey and Russia reached a deal to establish a demilitarised zone in Syria's Idlib province to prevent bloodshed in the rebel-held territory where nearly three million people live.
""Those who equip terrorists with tens of thousands of trucks and cargo planes, load of arms for sake of tactical interests will most definitely feel sorrow in the future,"" he also said.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has renounced the United Nations Security for ""standing idle to the oppression"" in Myanmar, Palestine and Bosnia among other nations.
In a speech before the UN on Tuesday, Erdogan said that ""those who remained silent on the oppression of the Palestinians"" are only encouraging the oppressors.
""Even if the whole world turns its back, Turkey will continue to be on the side of the oppressed Palestinians,"" he said.
US President Donald Trump has declared that America's trade deficit with China is ""unacceptable"".
In a speech before the UN, Trump said that the world trading system ""is in dire need of change"", complaining that over the last two decades the US has suffered $13 trillion in trade deficit with China.
US President Donald Trump has asked all nations to isolate Iran's leadership and vowed that more sanctions will follow after the resumption of oil sanctions on November 5.
Trump said that Iranian leaders are ""sowing chaos, death and destruction"" in the Middle East.
""Iran's leaders plunder the nation's resources to enrich themselves and to spread mayhem across the Middle East and far beyond,"" he said.
Trump said Iran's neighbours have paid a ""heavy toll"" for the region's agenda of ""aggression and expansion"".
US President Donald Trump said that in less than two years since his election, his country has never been ""stronger, safer and richer"".
Speaking Tuesday at the UN General Assembly in New York, Trump also highlighted his achievement with North Korea, but added that sanctions will continue until denuclearisation is carried out.
UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has warned that the world has reached ""a pivotal moment"" in global warming and risks runaway climate change if leaders don't act in the next two years.
Speaking Tuesday at the UN General Assembly in New York, Guterres told world leaders that they are not doing enough to combat what he calls ""a direct existential threat"" that is moving faster than people are working to combat it.
He's calling for making sure the international Paris climate change agreement is implemented. US President Donald Trump has announced he's withdrawing his country from the pact. Guterres is planning a climate summit next year.
The world is suffering from ""trust deficit disorder,"" UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said in remarks ahead of world leaders' speeches at the UN headquarters in New York.
People are losing faith in political establishments, power relations are unclear and ""democratic principles are under siege,"" Guterres said.
""The world is more connected, yet societies are becoming more fragmented. Challenges are growing outward, while many people are turning inward,"" the UN chief added.
US President Donald Trump has tweeted to say he will not be meeting Iranian President Hassan Rouhani during the United Nations General Assembly in New York, US.
""Despite requests, I have no plans to meet Iranian President Hassan Rouhani. Maybe someday in the future. I am sure he is an absolutely lovely man!"" Trump said.
Rouhani already told NBC News on Monday there would not be a meeting.
""Naturally, if someone is keen on having a meeting and holding dialogue and creating progress in relationships, that person would not use the tool of sanctions and threats [and bring] to bear all of its power against another government and nation,"" the Iranian leader said.
Despite requests, I have no plans to meet Iranian President Hassan Rouhani. Maybe someday in the future. I am sure he is an absolutely lovely man!
Here are some of the key issues expected to feature heavily at this year's General Assembly.
The Rohingya: Countries are divided on an appropriate response to the Rohingya crisis, with US Ambassador Nikki Haley calling for strong and immediate action against Myanmar's leadership and Chinese ambassador Wu Haitao urging a softer approach based on ""constructive assistance"".
Syria: As the battle for Idlib looms, UN officials have called on all parties to ensure that civilian casualties are avoided, but there are no signs of these warnings being heeded.
Iran nuclear deal: Relations between the US and Iran are at a low since Trump pulled out of the nuclear deal in May. Meanwhile, Europe is trying to keep the agreement afloat.

New Zealand's Prime Minster Jacinda Ardern made history when she brought her three-month-old daughter into the assembly hall on Monday evening.
Ardern called bringing her baby into the meeting a ""practical decision"".
""Neve is actually nearby me most of the time in New Zealand, she's just not always caught. But here, when she's awake, we try and keep her with me. So that was the occasion,"" the New Zealand Herald quoted her as saying.
The head of state's partner, Clarke Gayford, earlier tweeted a picture of the ID badge of Ms Neve Te Aroha Ardern Gayford - New Zealand's ""first baby"".
Because everyone on twitter's been asking to see Neve's UN id, staff here whipped one up. I wish I could have captured the startled look on a Japanese delegation inside UN yesterday who walked into a meeting room in the middle of a nappy change. Great yarn for her 21st. pic.twitter.com/838BI96VYX
The General Assembly is the main deliberative and policymaking organ of the UN. It is the only UN body with equal representation, meaning each country has one vote.
The General Assembly convenes once a year for three months starting in mid-September and, if necessary, again from January.
The event that draws much of the media's attention is the general debate, which kicks off on Tuesday.
During the general debate, which is scheduled to last for nine days, world leaders take turns delivering speeches about the issues that matter to their governments.
Representatives from each of the 193 UN member states get 15 minutes in principle to speak. Here's a schedule.
Some of the most memorable moments in the history of the general debate are Benjamin Netanyahu's ""red line"" speech, former Libyan president Muammar Gaddafi's 96-minute speech during which he ripped a copy of the UN charter, and Trump calling North Korean leader Kim Jong-un ""rocket man"".
Maria Fernanda Espinosa is the first woman ever from Latin America and the Caribbean to preside over the General Assembly.
Before the general debate, Al Jazeera spoke to the Ecuadorian about her work and her message to world leaders about the week ahead.

Taking the stage to muted applause at the annual United Nations General Assembly meeting on Saturday, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Walid al-Moallem slammed international interference in Syria, denied Damascus' use of chemical weapons and accused the US-led coalition of war crimes.
With only Idlib province still under rebel control, al-Moallem explained confidently that the ""situation on the ground has become more stable and secure"" and that local reconciliation was well under way. He also thanked the Syrian people for their fortitude during the bloody conflict.
Throughout the speech, al-Moallem emphasised Syria's right to sovereignty and decried the actions of a US-led coalition battling the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (also known as ISIS or ISIL) for doing ""everything but fight terrorism"".
He claimed the ""illegitimate"" coalition, which includes international players along with local and regional opposition forces, destroyed the Syrian city of Raqqa- a former ISIS stronghold - and took part in massacres of civilians, including women and children as a means of ""spreading chaos in international relations"" and promoting colonialism and hegemony.
Al-Moallem once again denied findings by UN investigators, which have attributed several of the at least 17 chemical attacks reported during the conflict to government forces.
""We fully condemn the use of chemical weapons under any circumstances,"" he said, claiming that no unbiased investigation or evidence had been presented to link his government with chemical attacks.
The issue has been a flashpoint at the UN Security Council, with Russia vetoing efforts to investigate the Assad regime fully.
Saturday's speech came as Syrian government forces, backed by Russia and Iran, have retaken most of territory rebels seized during the war, which has killed more than 400,000 people.
An offensive by government forces on Idlib - the last remaining rebel stronghold - was averted last week when Russia and Turkey reached a deal to establish a demilitarised zone around the province.
Al Jazeera's Hashem Ahelbarra, reporting from the United Nations, said al-Moallem's ""defiant"" speech was intended to send a message to both the Syrian opposition and the international community.
""He was telling the Syrian opposition: 'You’ve lost the war, you’ve got to come back home, you should forget [talking about] the future of Syria without Bashar al-Assad',"" said Ahelbarra.
During the speech, the Syrian foreign minister mentioned ""occupation forces,"" vowing that the Syrian government will free the country from all ""illegitimate foreign troops"".
""He’s saying the presence of Turkish soldiers in the northern part of the country, American and French soldiers in the eastern part of the country, providing assistance to the Kurds is unacceptable and if they don’t pull out from those areas, then the Syrian army has all the legitimate authority to go ahead and liberate those areas,"" said Ahelbarra.
""In one way or another [the international community] all realise that Assad has emerged as the winner, but the future is not guaranteed for any party in Syria,"" he said.
Al-Moallem said that ""doors are wide open for all Syrians abroad"" to return home and that this will be a priority for Damascus.
Since the conflict began in 2011, some 5.6 million people have fled Syria, with as many as 6.6 million others internally displaced, according to the UN's refugee agency.
""Today the situation on the ground is more stable and secure, thanks to combatting terrorism,"" he said. ""All conditions are now present for the voluntary return of refugees.""
Al-Moallem said Syria welcomes reconstruction aid from any country not involved in ""aggression"" towards Syria, but those offering conditional assistance were ""neither invited or welcome to help"".
Towards the end of his address, al-Moallem briefly touched on international politics, chastising Israel for its ""oppressive and aggressive policies"" in Golan Heights and branding the country's recently-passed nation state law as ""racist"".
He also slammed the US decision to recognise Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and withdraw funding for the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA).

https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/09/sanitary-pads-panties-rohingya-women-working-180923105346294.html,refugee,937,Fri Sep 28 2018 20:29:38 GMT+0000,Tarek Mahmud,Sanitary pads and panties: Rohingya women working to help others,"Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh - In the world's largest refugee camp, dozens of Rohingya women work diligently, their small factory a hub of activity; they're making sanitary pads and women's underwear to be distributed to Rohingya refugee women like them.
The one-room factory near Kutupalong refugee camp is buzzing, the quiet chatter of conversation barely discernible over whirring sewing machines set up in rows. Workers crouch on the floor, drawing patterns with white chalk on black fabric stretched down the middle of the room.
Others cut fabric, sew and iron sanitary napkins.
""It's very much needed for the women,"" Hasina Begum, the factory's supervisor told Al Jazeera, referring to the washable and reusable napkins.
""If they do not use them and rely instead on dirty cloths, they will fall sick.""
The 40-year-old, who is from Cox's Bazar, said before the production, Rohingya women were afflicted with a number of diseases including leukorrhea, gonorrhoea and other vaginal infections.
""We are distributing these products to women and also instructing them on how to use them,"" she said.
Kutupalong camp's population has swelled to more than 650,000 since August 2017, which marked the beginning of the mass exodus of Rohingya refugees fleeing a bloody campaign led by the Myanmar army in Rakhine state.
While several initiatives have been set up in the camp offering men and women vocational training in carpentry, soap-making and electrical appliance repair, only registered refugees who arrived in previous influxes are able to work.
According to the UN refugee agency, only 34,000 out of 1.1 million Rohingya are registered as refugees in Cox's Bazar. The more recently displaced Rohingya are not.
Hafsina Begum - no relation to Hasina - is a registered refugee. She was born in the camp after her parents fled their village of Fukira Bazar in Rakhine in 1999, and has been working in the factory for five years - since she was 15. Her family is now dependent on her income, which she says has earned her a degree of financial independence.
""Before coming to the factory, I was not skilled in professional work,"" she told Al Jazeera. ""Now I have learned how to tailor. I can sew anything.""
""Before that, we used simple cloths that were not comfortable,"" she said. ""But these sanitary napkins we make feel much better.""
The factory is part of a project under the Technical Assistance Inc., funded by the United Nations refugee agency (UNHCR) and established in 2011.
According to the supervisor, UNHCR sets the production target, while supplies and raw material are provided by TAI.
""On average, we make more than 6,000 sanitary napkins and up to 3,000 panties per month,"" Hasina said.
""There's the physical benefit, and for the women who make the products, financial benefits too,"" she added.
The products, along with antiseptic cream and bathing and laundry soap - the latter two also produced by Rohingya workers in adjacent factories - are distributed to more than 4,000 Rohingya women - including the workers - between the ages of 13 and 49 every six months.
""The latest distribution to 4,296 women was in June,"" Hasina said. ""We had a surplus of production, so we hope that the products will also be given to some of the unregistered Rohingya women in the camp.""
Hasina said interest in this income-generating project among women trained in sewing and tailoring was beyond expectations, far in excess of the 40 positions available in the factory.
""We formed groups and gave them all a chance to work by following a rotating schedule,"" she said. ""Every three or four months, the working group was replaced by another so that everyone interested received the opportunity to work.""
According to a TAI official, the women working in the factory all underwent a six-month training course before starting. He added all the women selected are extremely vulnerable individuals.
""This includes adolescent girls from the age of 15 until the age 35 and single mothers, widows, divorcees, girls who have elderly parents or large families that need supporting,"" the official explained.
He added unmarried girls need to have the approval of their parents, but there was no requirement that the workers have completed their schooling.
A similar programme has also been set up in the Nayapara refugee camp, which is located in the other sub-district of Teknaf.
Hafsina's average output target is 600 sanitary napkins and 300 panties a month.
""The work gives me some financial support,"" she said. ""I can give money to my parents. And when I need to, I can use my own earning. This is the benefit of working.""
For each sanitary napkin and undergarment, the workers make TK15 each, or $0.18. The monthly income for a worker is between TK2,500 and TK3,00 ($30 to $35). The higher the output, the more they earn.
""With the latest swell of Rohingya refugees in the camp, workers earned between TK5,000 to TK7,000 ($58 to $82),"" Hasina said. ""It depends on the target.""
The factory offers another advantage for the working women, who use the space for socialising and constructive interactions.
""These women live in tiny one-room shacks,"" Hasina the supervisor said. ""When they come here, it is like a respite for them and lessens the financial strain on their families.""
As for her, Hasina said the work was rewarding in bridging the gap closer between the local women in Cox's Bazar and the Rohingya.
""My role is an example of positive engagement with the Rohingya, where we teach them how to better their lives in the camp,"" she said.

Thursday's vote came a week after Canadian MPs approved a motion recognising the crimes committed against the Rohingya as genocide.
Aung San Suu Kyi received the honour from Ottawa in 2007, when she was a democracy advocate under long house arrest. But the Myanmar leader has been under fire for her failure to condemn the military campaign that has driven more than 700,000 Rohingya into neighbouring Bangladesh in what the UN human rights chief called ""a textbook example of ethnic cleansing"".
Canadian parliament's decision to revoke the symbolic honour was due to a ""persistent refusal to denounce the Rohingya genocide"", said Adam Austen, spokesman for Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland.
""We will continue to support the Rohingya by providing humanitarian assistance, imposing sanctions against Myanmar's generals and demanding that those responsible be held accountable before a competent international body,"" said Austen.
MP Gabriel Ste Marie, who proposed the motion, told reporters he thought the vote was ""a great symbol"".
Member of Parliament Salma Zahid called Aung San Suu Kyi's ""unwillingness to take any moral leadership ... inexcusable, and deeply disappointing"".
Parliament just unanimously agreed to revoke the honorary Canadian citizenship of Myanmar’s Aung San Suu Kyi. Her unwillingness to take any moral leadership for the genocide of the Rohingya in her country is inexcusable, and deeply disappointing.
Rights organisations have accused Myanmar military of committing extrajudicial killings, gang rape and arson during their bloody campaign launched in August last year after army posts came under attack from Rohingya fighters.
Hundreds of thousands of Rohingya now live in cramped refugee camps in Bangladesh, fearful of returning home despite a repatriation deal.
Andrew Leslie, Minister Freeland's parliamentary secretary, said ""the machinery of government will chew over the details of what specifically is required to implement"" the motion.
Only five other individuals have ever been given honorary citizenship in Canada, including the Dalai Lama, Malala Yousafzai and Nelson Mandela.

Several major donors, including Arab and European Union (EU) states, are expected to announce an increase in their contributions to the UN's Relief and Work Agency (UNRWA) at a meeting on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly on Thursday in an attempt to fill the $300m gap left by its biggest contributor.
UNRWA has raised some additional funds from other contributors in recent weeks but the agency's Commissioner-General Pierre Krahenbuhl told Al Jazeera that raising the $185m required to keep operating until the end of 2018 is a ""very uphill struggle"".
""The size of the cut was very, very significant from the US and therefore we are certainly not out of the woods by any stretch of the imagination,"" said Krahenbuhl.
The agency was established in 1949 to provide relief and assistance to the 700,000 Palestinians who were expelled or fled from their homeland a year earlier, as well as their descendants.
It currently supports five million people in Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, the West Bank, Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip.
A total of 677 schools and 143 health facilities, along with tens of thousands of jobs are at risk as the agency battles to survive its worst ever financial crisis, with only enough money in the bank to operate until mid-October.
""We managed to open our schools on time in August and September for half a million students which was very good news,"" said Krahenbuhl.
""Now we need to keep them open, keep our clinics open and keep the other services running, so that requires a lot of work.""
More than 100 agency staff have been laid off and hundreds more roles have been reduced to part-time positions, while deep pay cuts have been introduced in response to the Trump administration's unilateral decision.
These jobs are a lifeline in areas where unemployment rates can reach 40 percent and a loss of earnings could have devastating ripple effects on families and whole communities, Krahenbuhl warned.
Loans towards development projects have also been suspended and the provision of mental health services downgraded.
""In Gaza, where those needs are very severe and very significant, it is wrong to have to reduce in this way because the needs have not gone away,"" said Krahenbuhl, referring to the dramatic rise in anxiety, depression and suicide in the besieged territory as residents struggle to cope with the severe restrictions imposed by the 11-year Israeli blockade.
On Wednesday, thousands of Palestinian school children from refugee camps across the occupied West Bank went on strike, protesting the US cuts.
UNRWA Commissioner-General Pierre Krahenbuhl
Krahenbuhl reiterated the fundamental right for Palestinians to return to their homelands, established under UN Resolution 194.
US Ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley has disputed UNRWA's estimates of the number of Palestinian refugees and criticised the claim that the right of return must be a fundamental requirement of any peace settlement between Israel and Palestine.
""You can be certain everyone is advocating the right to return of the Rohingya, just as people will advocate for the right of return for Afghan refugees or Syrian refugees,"" Krahenbuhl said.
""Why would it be that the only community on the planet that doesn't have a right of return would be the Palestinians? That wouldn't make any sense.""
Krahenbuhl said the politically motivated withdrawal of support by the US is a matter of great regret.
""We should not have political disputes settled through cutting humanitarian funding.""
He also dismissed suggestions that UNRWA was in any way responsible for the political situation in which Palestinian refugees find themselves, a common barb from its critics in the US and Israel.
""The absence of a political resolution of the conflict between Israelis and Palestinians is what has perpetuated their refugee status, not the work of UNRWA.
""Politicians should look more into addressing the root causes of this conflict.""

The 47-member council voted by 35 votes to three, with seven abstentions, on Thursday in favour of a resolution brought by the European Union and the Organization of Islamic Cooperation.
China, the Philippines, and Burundi voted against the move.
A year ago, Myanmar troops led a brutal crackdown in Rakhine state in response to attacks by the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army on 30 Myanmar police posts and a military base.
More than 700,000 Rohingya fled the crackdown and most are now living in refugee camps in neighbouring Bangladesh.
The resolution sets up a body to ""collect, consolidate, preserve and analyse evidence of the most serious international crimes and violations of international law committed in Myanmar since 2011, and to prepare files in order to facilitate and expedite fair and independent criminal proceedings"".
The new agency is to work closely with any future prosecution brought by the International Criminal Court, which said earlier this month that it had jurisdiction over deportations of Rohingya from Myanmar to Bangladesh.
Myanmar Ambassador Kyaw Moe Tun said the resolution was based on the report of a UN fact-finding mission that his government had categorically rejected, and which was unbalanced, one-sided and encouraged disunity of the country.
""The draft resolution is based on serious but unverified accusations and recommendations … that could even endanger the national unity of the country,"" he said.
Kyaw Moe said the resolution's intrusive language and demands would not contribute to finding lasting resolutions to the delicate situation in Rakhine state.
The UN report said Myanmar's military carried out mass killings and gang rapes of Rohingya with ""genocidal intent"" and called for commander-in-chief Min Aung Hlaing and five named generals to be prosecuted for the gravest crimes.
In Thursday's resolution, the council said there was enough information to warrant a competent court ""to determine their liability for genocide"".
Chinese diplomat Chen Cheng told the council that Beijing opposed the resolution because it was very likely to exacerbate the tensions. ""This is in no one's interest,"" he said.

More than 130,000 schoolchildren and refugee residents in the West Bank participated in the protests, according to Imad al-Din Ishtewi, the coordinator for ""Sana'oud,"" the national committee for the return of refugees.
""Our people categorically reject the unjust American decisions,"" he told local news agency Maan. ""We have begun to mobilise momentum through popular [protest] in order to uphold our inalienable rights of return and the right to self-determination.""
In August, the US government announced it would no longer fund the United Nations Relief Works and Agency (UNRWA), sparking a funding crisis.
UNRWA provides benefits and services – such as schooling, healthcare, social services, and food aid – to five million Palestinian refugees in the West Bank, Gaza Strip, Jordan, Lebanon, and Syria.
Most of the refugees are descendants of the 700,000 Palestinians who were forcibly displaced from their homes in the run-up to the establishment of Israel in 1948.
The US had been UNRWA's largest contributor by far, providing it with $350m annually - roughly a quarter of its overall budget.
Speaking from a student protest in the Jalazone refugee camp in the occupied West Bank city of Ramallah, Al Jazeera's Imran Khan said that the overlying message from the protesters is that ""dignity is priceless"".
""What they are saying is that the US needs to refund those UNRWA programmes that allow schools like this to function,"" he said.
""These people are very worried that their school does not have enough funding to take them to the end of the month, never mind to the end of the academic term.
""They are worried that their school will have to shut down, and it's the case of the schools like this across the occupied West Bank where they simply don't know where the money is going to come from.""
UNRWA, he continued, has been looking to other donors to try to make up the shortfall in funding, but has not been successful so far.
""UNRWA simply doesn't know where the money is going to come from,"" Khan said. ""They do say they have some money to be able to keep some programmes open, although which ones they are they don't really know.""
The protests followed similar rallies in the Gaza Strip, where on Monday, the UNRWA employees' union went on strike to protest against job losses and US funding cuts. More than 250 UNRWA schools, as well as medical centres and food aid distribution points, were shut down for the day.
Union officials said that the contracts of dozens of engineers have been terminated by UNRWA in recent months.
The funding cuts have also forced the agency to close its mental health programme, which had provided direct services to Palestinian refugees in Gaza and had employed about 430 people.

SOS Mediterranee and Doctors Without Borders (MSF) on Sunday accused Italy of exercising ""blatant economic and political pressure"" on Panama's Maritime Authority (PMA), which had registered the ship.
In a statement, the NGOs stated that Panamanian authorities told them Italian authorities had urged them to take ""immediate action"" against the Aquarius and that the vessel ""implies a political problem against the Panamanian government"".
""This announcement condemns hundreds of men, women and children who are desperate to reach safety to a watery grave,"" the organisations said.
Italian Interior Minister Matteo Salvini took to Twitter to deny his involvement, saying he doesn't even know what telephone prefix Panama has.
The far-right Lega politician is known for his tough stance on immigration and has said that Italy ""cannot take one more"" asylum seeker.
He denied the Aquarius the right to dock in an Italian port twice in recent months, sending the ship adrift on the Mediterranean in June and again in August.
Panama said it revoked the registration due to ""non-respect"" of ""international legal procedures"" relating to migrant rescues in the Mediterranean.
The AFP news agency reported that the Central American country launched the revocation procedure after Italian authorities complained that the captain of the Aquarius had ""refused to return migrants and refugees back to their point of origin"".
The Aquarius picked up 11 migrants off the coast of Libya on Thursday but refused to take them back to the North African country and instead went in search of an alternative port.
The vessel's operators have said they refuse to disembark people in Libya because it is not a place of safety.
The last search-and-rescue vessel run by non-governmental actors in the central Mediterranean, the Aquarius was on an operation when it was notified of the PMA's decision and said it currently has 58 migrants and refugees on board.
The ship had been registered with Panama since August when Gibraltar revoked its registration.
When it next docks, it will lose its flag and will not be able to leave port again until another maritime authority has agreed to register the ship.
According to the United Nations refugee agency, 1,719 people have died or gone missing in 2018 while trying to cross the Mediterranean to reach European shores.

Dubbed the ""Salvini decree"" after Matteo Salvini, the country's far-right interior minister who drafted it, the document is an emergency instrument that parliament must convert into law within 60 days, but can also be extended.
""It's a step forward to make Italy safer,"" Salvini wrote just after the meeting, ""to combat more effectively the mafia and traffickers, to reduce the costs of excessive immigration, to expel more quickly criminals and fake refugees, to revoke citizenship from terrorists, to strengthen police powers.""
Controversial parts of the decree include a crackdown on issuing permits for humanitarian reasons that Italy grants to applicants who do not qualify for asylum or subsidiary protection, as well as the planned downsizing of the municipality-led reception system (SPRAR), praised for facilitating integration.
""What we see in the new decree is another step in the Italian government's repressive policies, aimed at an indiscriminate stop of flows and at the criminalisation of migration, at sea and on land,"" Anne Garella, head of Doctors without Borders (known by its French initials, MSF) Italy, said in a statement.
Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said the decree was in line with human rights.
""We are revising legislation to make it more effective,"" he told reporters.
""The aim is to reorganise the whole system of recognising international protection to come in line with European standards.""
The decree extends the time migrants can be detained in repatriation centres from three to six months, and allows for the revocation of refugee status from those who commit crimes including drug trafficking and mugging. The decree also provides for stricter rules for obtaining citizenship.
The decree promises to end the case-by-case nature of decisions on ""humanitarian protection"" permits, the form of international protection most commonly granted in Italy.
Conte said the instrument was not being dismantled, but simply regulated in a way that ""does not undermine international commitments and the protection of basic rights"".
Italy examined 81,000 applications in 2017.
In one on four cases, the applicant was granted ""humanitarian protection,"" which comes with a two-year residency permit, while refugee status and subsidiary protection both amounted to about eight percent of the total outcomes. More than 50 percent of applications were rejected.
Salvini had already asked asylum commissions to limit the number of humanitarian permits issued in an official letter last summer.
From now on, Salvini said at the press conference, humanitarian protection will be granted to ""victims of serious work exploitation, of trafficking, domestic violence, serious natural disasters, to those in need of medical care, and for civil merit"".
Concerns remain that the measure will lead to more people finding themselves undocumented and without rights on Italian streets.
According to the Italian Institute for International Political Studies (ISPI), the number could rise to 60,000 more in the next two years than under the current system.
ISPI's Matteo Villa said the figure was calculated by considering the applications currently pending - about 130,000 - as well as the fact that humanitarian permits have to be renewed every two years, and some will expire.
""With this measure and without being able to repatriate people, the effect is creating new forms of irregularity,"" Villa told Al Jazeera.
""Repatriations are very difficult to do, and the majority of sub-Saharan states only repatriate less than 10 percent of people who receive a deportation order. It's hard to imagine the feasibility of something as ambitious as going from 5,000 to 7,000 repatriations a year, to 40,000 to 50,000.""
Italy currently has repatriation deals with countries such as Tunisia, Egypt, Morocco and Nigeria, but it cannot deport asylum seekers coming from Mali or Senegal, for instance.
Migrant rights groups and local authorities have expressed concerns about changes to the system of local reception and integration (SPRAR), which from now on will be aimed exclusively at those who have been granted asylum and at vulnerable cases.
According to Irma Melini, president of the migration commission at ANCI (National Association of Italian Municipalities), the downsizing of the SPRAR system would have ""a disruptive effect on the ground, making it hard for local administrators to protect citizens"", as she stated in a newspaper interview.
It would leave migrant reception at the mercy of the parallel ""emergency"" system of reception centres, often privately run, which has made headlines for its dysfunctional nature.
The decree is part of a general crackdown on migration that has caused diplomatic friction in Europe but has earned the interior minister consensus with the Italian electorate, according to recent polls.
On the Mediterranean front, a decision by the Panama Maritime Authority yesterday to revoke registration from the ship Aquarius 2 means there will be no more NGO ships allowed to perform search and rescue operations in the Mediterranean, unless the Aquarius finds a new flag to sail under.
NGOs SOS Mediterranee and MSF, which run the ship, charged the Panamanian authorities were acting under pressure from the Italian government, a claim Salvini denied.
According to UNCHR, while the number of arrivals from Libya has gone down, the percentage of those who do not survive the journey has risen.

The bloodshed occurred on Saturday in Beni, a flashpoint city in the North Kivu region. The Congolese army has blamed the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF), a notorious rebel militia.
The Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) said it and other aid agencies have been forced to temporarily suspend activities in Beni because of the attack.
""This points to an increasingly worrisome security situation across the country,"" the group said in a statement on Monday, adding that it had to halt activities due to intensifying and frequent clashes in Djugu territory in the northern province of Ituri, and Fizi in South Kivu over the last two weeks.
""These suspensions have disrupted aid to thousands of people in need of humanitarian assistance and protection,"" the NRC statement added.
Stephen Lamin, area manager for NRC, said it was a ""worst-case scenario"". The group provides food, household items, education and legal counselling in the region.
The latest Ebola outbreak in the DRC's east has infected at least 118 people, 69 of whom have died, according to Congo's health ministry.
Health Minister Oly Ilunga Kalenga claimed that health staff had temporarily suspended field activities requiring home visits and that ""all pillars of the response remain fully operational"".
""Despite the unfortunate events of the last few days, the Ministry of Health remains fully committed,"" he said, adding that health centres, including the Beni Ebola Treatment Center, remained open.
Witnesses said Saturday's violence began in Beni city centre in the late afternoon when attackers began using guns and machetes against people there.
An initial army estimate put the death toll at 18, including four soldiers, but later raised it to 21.
On Monday morning, many shops, schools and businesses in Beni remained closed in protest, while an opposition legislator called for ""a rapid assessment of the army's operational effectiveness"" ahead of the December elections.
""The front line is no longer in the Virunga National Park and is now in Beni, which poses a real danger for the holding of safe elections on December 23,"" said Anselme Mwaka, an opposition MP from the Union for the Congolese Nation.
Since January, Congolese troops have been engaged in a military operation against the ADF, but have not yet managed to stop the bloodshed in and around Beni.
The ADF is one of a number of armed groups that hold territory in the eastern DRC and are battling for control of the region's rich mineral resources.

The state department report, reviewed by Reuters news agency ahead of its expected release on Monday, could be used to justify further US sanctions against Myanmar authorities, said US officials.
But the report stopped short of describing the crackdown as genocide or crimes against humanity.
The findings were based on more than a 1,000 interviews of Rohingya men and women in refugee camps in neighbouring Bangladesh, where more than 700,000 Rohingya have fled after a military campaign last year in Myanmar's Rakhine state.
""The survey reveals that the recent violence in northern Rakhine state was extreme, large-scale, widespread, and seemingly geared toward both terrorizing the population and driving out the Rohingya residents,"" said the 20-page report.
""The scope and scale of the military's operations indicate they were well-planned and coordinated,"" it added.
On August 25, 2017, Myanmar launched a military offensive - termed by the UN as a textbook example of ethnic cleansing - after a Rohingya armed group carried out attacks on border security forces.
Survivors narrated in harrowing detail what they had witnessed, including soldiers killing infants and small children, the shooting of unarmed men and victims buried alive or thrown into mass graves.
They described widespread sexual assault and rape of Rohingya women by Myanmar's military, often carried out in public.
One witness described how four Rohingya girls were abducted, tied up and raped for three days. They were left heavily bleeding and ""half dead"", he said, according to the report.
The state department report coincided with the United States pledging $185m in aid for Rohingya refugees.
On Monday, US ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley announced the new funding for food, water, healthcare and other critical aid during a ministerial meeting on Myanmar crisis on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly meeting in New York. The US report comes nearly a month after a team of UN investigators issued its own report, accusing Myanmar's military of acting with ""genocidal intent"" and calling for the country's commander-in-chief and five generals to be tried by the International Criminal Court.
Meanwhile, Myanmar's military chief on Monday warned against foreign interference as world leaders gather at the UN to find ways to hold the country's powerful generals accountable for atrocities against the Rohingya.
In his first public comments since the UN fact-finding report, Min Aung Hlaing said Myanmar abided by UN pacts, but warned that ""talks to meddle in internal affairs"" may cause ""misunderstanding"".
""As countries set different standards and norms, any country, organization and group has no right to interfere in and make decision(s) over sovereignty of a country,"" Min Aung Hlaing said in comments reported in English on his website.
Min Aung Hlaing also shrugged off demands from UN investigators for the army to withdraw from politics in Myanmar, where it remains hugely influential despite a nominal transition to civilian rule in 2011.

Last year, more than 111,500 refugees and migrants crossed into war-ravaged Yemen in the hope of using it as a transit point to enter Saudi Arabia.
But as fighting escalates in Yemen, scores of Yemenis have clambered aboard tiny fishing vessels taking a route in the opposition direction.

The country's military said 38 people were rescued from the sinking boat on Saturday and that the child's body had been retrieved.
""A navy patrol unit immediately headed there, retrieved the body of a five-year-old child and rescued the rest"" of the passengers, a statement said.
Four of those rescued were taken to nearby hospitals with the help of the Lebanese Red Cross, the statement added.
Lebanon's Al-Jadeed TV reported that the child who died was a five-year-old from Palestine.
Lebanon hosts the highest number of Syrian refugees in the world per capita, with at least one million registered in the country.
Humanitarian representatives and government officials say the number is likely much higher, since many refugees who have fled Syria's civil war to Lebanon are not officially registered with the United Nations.
Lebanese authorities have begun organising return trips to refugees willing to go back.
But UN officials say with no peace deal in Syria, it is too early for the mass return of refugees.
Syrian refugees in Turkey and Lebanon have been using small boats to take them to Greece or Cyprus in the hope of claiming asylum in the EU.

Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov made the announcement on Friday as his Turkish counterpart, Mevlut Cavusoglu, said he and Lavrov would meet Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif in New York City next week to further discuss the situation in Syria.
""Just yesterday or the day before, the militaries of Russia and Turkey agreed the concrete frontiers of the demilitarised zone,"" Lavrov told reporters during a visit to Sarajevo.
Moscow said the demilitarised zone would help stop attacks from Idlib on Syrian army positions and Russia's military bases in the region.
On Monday, Russian President Vladimir Putin and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan agreed on the establishment of the 15-20km zone.
Security in the area will be overseen by Turkish contingents and Russian military police. The agreement will prevent military action against Idlib, Russia's defence minister said.
""It's an intermediate step ... but a necessary step,"" Lavrov said of the zone.
""By mid-October, all [fighters from Hay'et Tahrir al-Sham] must leave this demilitarised zone, and all heavy military equipment must be pulled out of there,"" he said.
According to the diplomatic sources in Ankara, a coordinated feasibility study on the zone is being held by the Turkish and Russian military and intelligence officers. It is planned to be completed by September 30 and then presented to Putin and Erdogan.
Cavusoglu said he will join Lavrov and Zarif in a trilateral meeting on Syria in New York, on the sideline of the UN General Assembly meeting.
Russia and Iran are key allies of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's regime, helping the Syrian government establish control over most of the country's territory after intervening in the multifront conflict in 2015.
Turkey, however, backs opposition fighters seeking to overthrow the Syrian leader. It has said a large-scale offensive against the rebels could trigger a mass exodus towards its border.
Dr Oytun Orhan, coordinator of Syria studies at the Ankara based Center for Middle Eastern Studies, told Al Jazeera that Turkey might need to take military measures against fighter groups in case of a confrontation threat, particularly against formerly al-Qaeda-affiliated Hay'et Tahrir al-Sham (HTS). He said ""especially foreign fighters within the HTS have the potential to sabotage the zone deal"".
In Idlib, protests continue in the rebel-held province calling on the international community to stop the bloodshed, while demanding the removal of Assad.
Syrian activist Alaa el-Ahmed told Al Jazeera there is a feeling among the opposition that they have been abandoned by the world.
""We are concerned because some countries are now moving closer to the regime. Europe and the US, for example, they have not taken any real stance against the crimes committed by the regime,"" Ahmed said.
An estimated three million Syrians live in Idlib, half of them already displaced from cities and towns under state control.
Meanwhile, Jan Egeland, a UN humanitarian aid official for Syria, warned he still sees ""great potential for a lot of fighting"" in Idlib - despite the recent accord between Russia and Turkey.
Egeland said ""it's not over"" and air raids and ground offensives are likely to continue against UN-listed ""terrorist"" groups whose fighters live near civilians.
Egeland said some armed groups were prepared to fight to the end and urged talks with them ""to end the conflict without bloodshed for civilians"".

The House of Commons endorsed on Thursday the findings of a UN fact-finding mission on Myanmar that found ""crimes against humanity have been committed against the Rohingya"" and that these acts were sanctioned by top Myanmar military commanders.
In a motion, Canadian legislators said they ""recognise that these crimes against the Rohingya constitute genocide"".
Rights organisations have accused Myanmar military of committing extrajudicial killings, gang rape, and arson during their bloody campaign launched in August last year after army posts came under attack from Rohingya rebels.
More than 700,000 Rohingya people have forced to flee to neighbouring Bangladesh, where they now live in cramped refugee camps.
They also urged the UN Security Council to refer the case to the International Criminal Court (ICC), while also calling for Myanmar's generals to be investigated and prosecuted ""for the crime of genocide"".
""I want to underscore how tragic, how horrific the crimes against the Rohingya are,"" Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland said. ""We are leading an international effort for justice and accountability for the Rohingya.""
""Today's unanimous motion is a very important step in that effort.""
Human rights observers called the declaration as a significant milestone.
The UN report published last month said military generals, including Commander-in-Chief Min Aung Hlaing, must face investigation and prosecution for ""genocidal intent"" in Myanmar's northern Rakhine State, as well as crimes against humanity and other war crimes in the states of Kachin and Shan.
Myanmar denies any organised abuses.
Bangladesh and Myanmar signed an agreement last year to repatriate the Muslim minority - but it has stalled as the Rohingya fear to return to Myanmar's Rakhine State without their safety and rights guaranteed.

The appeals court handed down the decision on Thursday in the southern city of Szeged to uphold the conviction while reducing Ahmed H's sentence to five years.
Eda Seyhan, Amnesty International's counterterrorism campaigner who was in the courtroom, said in a statement to Al Jazeera, ""this judgement comes as a blow for Ahmed, his wife and his two young daughters.""
The charges stem from an incident on the Hungarian-Serbian border in 2015, at the height of Europe's refugee crisis.
Ahmed H - as he's identified in court documents, who had already been granted protected status and lived in Cyprus with his wife and children - was attempting to escort his elderly parents on their journey from Syria to Europe.
A confrontation occurred between a large group of asylum-seekers attempting to cross into Hungary and police. Ahmed H was caught on tape throwing stones in the direction of police.
Seyhan said Thursday's ruling was his final appeal.
The court counted the three years he has already served in a Hungarian prison towards his sentence. He will be eligible for release in early 2019.
Seyhan said throwing stones is not terrorism and the verdict rides ""roughshod over the law"".
She added the conviction ""plays into the hands of the Hungarian authorities' demonisation of refugees, migrants and those seeking to protect them"".
Awful. Just awful. Throwing stones is not terrorism. https://t.co/1nCYgoSGt4
Asked about Amnesty's criticism of Ahmed H's ruling, the Hungarian government's International Communications Office told Al Jazeera the fact the group isn't ""willing to accept the decision of the independent Hungarian court speaks for itself"".
The European Parliament voted in favour of disciplinary action against Hungary on September 12, citing the country's flouting of the EU's democratic norms.
A report authored by Dutch Greens MEP Judith Sargentini - to explain why disciplinary action should be used - admonished Hungary for its attacks against media plurality, academic freedom, and treatment of migrants and refugees.
Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto called the vote ""nothing less than the petty revenge of pro-immigration politicians"".

The move raised eyebrows among human rights campaigners because of Egypt's many well-documented abuses.
Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz, whose country currently holds the 28-member bloc's rotating presidency, announced the plan for ""in-depth cooperation"" with Cairo on Thursday at an informal EU summit in Salzburg, Austria.
""Egypt and the North African countries can be important partners for us in preventing ships heading to Europe and after their rescue being brought back, in other words to the countries of transit,"" Kurz said.
""Only in this way can we reduce illegal migration, can we destroy the business model of the smugglers, and stop drownings in the Mediterranean.""
The announcement came after Kurz and EU Council President Donald Tusk visited Cairo over the weekend for talks with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, the former top army general who seized power in a coup.
""We've got to ensure that as few people as possible leave northern African countries for Europe. If they do, the situation should be dealt with as close to the African coast as possible,"" said Kurz.
On Thursday, Kurz said Egypt was ""efficient"" and praised Sisi for providing ""an example when it comes to illegal migration and people smuggling"".
Tusk, meanwhile, said he will meet Sisi this weekend to take talks forward, and confirmed a EU-Arab League summit will be held in Cairo next February.
Migration talks with other north African countries will also be launched, he added.
Al Jazeera's Laurence Lee, reporting from Salzburg, said the plan for cooperation with Egypt was at an ""embryonic"" stage, with neither Kurz or Tusk providing significant detail on Thursday about the specific shape of any future arrangement.
""[But] it's the philosophy that counts and the philosophy says it's better to protect the Schengen free-movement zone inside the EU, not to allow them to come into the bloc in the first place, and that's a pretty hardline approach by any means,"" he said.
The Schengen Agreement - signed by 26 European countries, including 22 EU states - abolished many of the EU's internal borders, allowing for passport-free movement throughout most parts of the bloc.
Giulia Lagana, a senior analyst at the Brussels-based Open Society European Policy Institute, said the EU's move to win Egyptian assistance on migration would likely require the bloc to make ""significant concessions"" to Cairo.
""I would tend to think those are not just financial but would also include closing an eye to the human rights abuses being perpetrated in Egypt,"" Lagana told Al Jazeera.
""It would be very difficult to put into practice and of course if it does happen in some form it would be extremely dangerous from a human rights point of view.""
Under Sisi, Egyptian authorities have clamped down on freedom of speech and dissent, prompting Amnesty International to label the country an ""open-air prison for critics"".
The EU's look for help from the Egyptian leader comes as the number of migrants arriving in Europe is down significantly compared with 2015, when more than a million people entered the continent, most fleeing conflict in Syria and Iraq.
About 77,555 migrants and refugees have entered Europe by sea so far this year, according to the International Organisation of Migration (IOM), down from 131,884 arrivals by a similar point last year and 298,663 for the same period in 2016.
Leonard Doyle, a director for the IOM's media division, called on the bloc to put ""saving migrants lives and respecting migrants rights at the front and centre of everything"".
""I would be wary of looking at one silver bullet to solve a very, very complex, massive problem that is affecting people from right across the subcontinent of Africa and indeed other places,"" Doyle told Al Jazeera.

Widely known by his nickname Bobi Wine, Kyagulanyi was seized by security officers upon arrival at the international airport in Kampala on Thursday.
A prominent critic of hardline President Yoweri Museveni, police later said in a statement he had been ""peacefully escorted"" home.
Climbing on top of a car and pumping his fist outside his home, Kyagulanyi pledged to fight for freedom in Uganda.
""I cannot be a refugee. No. I am Ugandan and I will stay in Uganda and I will fight for my freedom. And I will get that freedom,"" he said.
""And if I don't get that freedom in my lifetime, at least my children or their children will get the freedom that they deserve.""
Security forces sealed off roads and erected barricades around Entebbe airport leading up to his return as helicopters flew overhead. Authorities banned rallies to welcome Kyagulanyi but many ignored those orders.
Al Jazeera's Malcolm Webb - reporting from outside Bobi Wine's home in Magere, 40km outside the capital - said hundreds of supporters defied the heavy security presence and gathered at his house.
""We spoke to him a short time ago, he said he's very tired and that he's still in pain from the injuries he sustained when he says he was tortured a few weeks ago,"" said Webb.
The 36-year old musician-turned-lawmaker is widely seen as posing a significant challenge to Museveni, 74, who has ruled the East African country since 1986.
Many supporters wore red T-shirts and hats. The colour has come to be associated with his ""people power"" movement, and demonstrators at Ugandan embassies in London, Nairobi and elsewhere have donned the same colour during protests.
Kyagulanyi attracted a youth following through songs critical of Museveni in a country where nearly 80 percent of the population is under the age of 30.
Bobi Wine sought treatment in the US earlier this month for wounds to his back and right shoulder that he allegedly sustained while in custody.
Uganda's government has denied accusations that he was tortured.
The pop singer, who won a national assembly seat last year, faces treason charges for his alleged role in an incident last month in which the president's convoy was pelted with stones. He denies wrongdoing.
His message - that young Ugandans need a dynamic new head of state to tackle the myriad problems they face - has electrified citizens who say they are fed up with corruption, unemployment, and state repression of dissent.
The government denies allegations of corruption and of stifling opposition.
Museveni's administration is facing growing criticism from its allies, particularly main donors the US and the European Union.

The examination will look at a range of allegations against Myanmar's security forces that could include the killing of Rohingya civilians, sexual violence, forced disappearance, destruction and looting, ICC prosecutor Fatou Bensouda said in a written statement on Tuesday.
""A preliminary examination is not an investigation but a process of examining the information available in order to reach a fully informed determination on whether there is a reasonable basis to proceed with an investigation,"" Bensouda added.
Myanmar has repeatedly argued that the ICC does not have jurisdiction to investigate the allegations because it is not a party to the Rome Statute, which established the court.
The ICC authorised Bensouda to open the case after its judges ruled that the alleged crime of deportation happened partly in Bangladesh, which is a member of the court.
""While Myanmar is not a State Party to the ICC, Bangladesh is. The Court may therefore exercise jurisdiction over conduct to the extent it partly occurred on the territory of Bangladesh,"" Bensouda wrote.
The announcement followed the release of a UN report that detailed allegations of crimes committed by the Myanmar military against the Rohingya.
It reiterated earlier findings that some senior Myanmar military officials should be prosecuted for war crimes and genocide.
Myanmar's ambassador in Geneva called that report ""one-sided"" and ""flawed.""
More than 700,000 mostly Muslim Rohingya have fled to Bangladesh since August last year.
The UN's refugee agency, UNHCR, estimates that children make up 55 percent of the total Rohingya refugee population in Bangladesh.
A family-counting exercise conducted in December 2017 by the UNHCR found more than 5,500 families being led by children under 18.
The Rohingya were stripped of citizenship in 1982 and have been subject to persecution in the Rakhine state of Myanmar, where most lived.
Labelled 'Bengali' by the government and much of the Myanmar population, to infer that they are interlopers from Bangladesh, Rohingya are denied access to healthcare, education and freedom of movement.

In northern Gaza, thousands of protesters demonstrated on Tuesday afternoon near the Israeli checkpoint crossing Erez, referred to by Palestinians as the Beit Hanoun crossing.
The protest was called for by the National High Committee to Break the Siege and was against the cuts in funding by the United States to the main United Nations refugee agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA.
Protesters also demanded an end to the 12-year blockade imposed on the coastal enclave.
Two men were killed as Israeli forces opened fire on the protesters. Gaza's health ministry identified the men as Mohammad Abu Naji, 34, and Ahmad Mohammad Omar, 20.
More than 30 others were wounded, the ministry added.
Palestinians in Gaza have been protesting along the fence east of the strip against the siege and for their right of return as part of the Great March of Return rallies since March 30.
More than 170 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli sniper fire and 18,000 others wounded.
Last month, the US declared it would halt all funding to UNRWA, creating a $300m deficit. Palestinian refugees benefit from a number of services the UN agency provides, ranging from schools, health centres, vocational training, and food handouts.
In a separate incident, Israeli forces in East Jerusalem shot dead a Palestinian man after they alleged he was about to carry out a stabbing attack against an Israeli in the Musrara neighbourhood near Damascus Gate.
Witnesses, however, told local Palestinian media agency Wafa that the man, 26-year-old Mohammed Yousef Alayan from Qalandiya refugee camp, was not armed and had gotten into an argument with the Israeli man.
Upon the intervention of Israeli forces, the witnesses said, Alayan tried to get away but was shot down with a barrage of bullets.
Police then closed off the area and prevented medics from reaching Alayan, whose body is still held by the Israeli army.

Witnesses described how soldiers and fighters targeted civilians by raping them, burning them alive, running them over with armoured vehicles, and hanging them from trees, Amnesty International said in a report on Wednesday.
""One interviewee said a girl as young as eight was gang-raped and another woman witnessed the rape of a 15-year-old boy,"" it said.
The report was based on interviews with 100 displaced people from Leer and Mayendit counties in Unity State, which have been among the hardest hit regions during South Sudan's five-year civil war.
Amnesty also documented the abduction of women and girls, and the deliberate killing of young boys and male infants. The attacks continued for a week after a ceasefire was announced.
""The government attacked dozens of civilians in these areas, burning houses systematically, killing people - including women, children, and elderly people,"" Amnesty's Joanne Mariner told Al Jazeera.
""We documented horrific cases in which elderly people - 70, 80, even 90 years old - were burned alive inside houses because the government was torching villages in a really systematic way.""
The killings echo the type of brutality meted out to civilians that have characterised South Sudan's war since its start.
South Sudan's government often dismisses such reports as ""rubbish"".
President Salva Kiir and rebel leader Riek Machar signed a new peace deal in Ethiopia last week after lengthy negotiations.
It allows the creation of a transitional government, with Machar to be reinstated as vice president.
Despite the breakthrough, many international observers remain sceptical as previous agreements have collapsed after warring parties failed to respect them.
Years of conflict in South Sudan has left more than half of its 12 million population in need of food aid for survival.
The world's newest country descended into civil war in 2013 after Kiir accused Machar, then his deputy, of plotting a coup.
The conflict has killed tens of thousands of people with more than two million fleeing the country, creating Africa's largest refugee crisis since the 1994 Rwandan genocide.

Residents of the province and its suburbs, home to nearly three million people - half of whom are internally displaced - have also questioned the willingness of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's government to abide by the agreement, described by observers as a diplomatic breakthrough.
The 15 to 20km-wide zone, expected to be implemented by October 15, would allow the ""withdrawal of all radical fighters"" from Idlib, Russian President Vladimir Putin said at a press conference with his Turkish counterpart.
This includes Hay'et Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), which is dominated by a rebel faction previously known as al-Nusra Front before renouncing its ties to al-Qaeda.
Dr Habib Kshouf said people in his village of Kherbet Eljoz were genuinely scared of a full-scale government-led assault prior to the agreement.
""The Sochi agreement gave people a glimpse of hope, that they would be spared an aerial and ground assault by government forces and Russia - at least for the time being,"" the 55-year-old told Al Jazeera from Jisr al-Shughour district, which recently came under bombardment.
At least 1.5 million of Idlib's population fled the Syrian government's advance in other provinces and now reside in makeshift camps that lack basic services such as clean drinking water and access to uninterrupted electricity.
""This [agreement] would ensure the return of electricity, water, and other basic services to people here,"" Kshouf said.
The deal, welcomed by UN envoy for Syria Staffan de Mistura on Tuesday, also requires opposition fighters to give up their heavy weaponry.
According to Marwan Kabalan, director of the Arab Center for Research and Policy Studies, the agreement is a ""win-win situation for almost everybody"".
""For Putin, this is the best he can achieve at this point of time,"" Kabalan told Al Jazeera.
For the Syrian government and Russia, the deal will move opposition fighters towards the north to secure a highway that leads to the Hmeimin airbase - operated by Russia - from any attacks.
It will also allow the reopening of the M5 highway that links the capital Damascus to Aleppo, and eventually to the trade route to Turkey and Europe.
Kabalan said the agreement ""should be perceived as a victory"" by opposition fighters.
""The agreement did not ask for the opposition's complete disarmament,"" he noted. ""And they will be staying in Idlib - they were not asked to relocate like they were in Deraa and Eastern Ghouta.""
Yet residents are concerned about whether the agreement will hold.
The government has been accused of ""indiscriminate attacks"" targeting civilian infrastructure in Idlib by NGOs and aid organisations - including Islamic Relief Worldwide - despite Idlib's inclusion in the so-called ""de-escalation zones"" aimed at shoring up ceasefires.
Since the beginning of September, dozens of people have been killed and wounded in air raids and attacks by the Syrian government and allied Russian fighter jets, according to activists on the ground.
""We've seen the regime use all sorts of excuses in the past when it bombed civilians in Idlib,"" Yahya Daoud, a 23-year-old originally from southern Damascus, told Al Jazeera.
""So the fear of a government assault is always intact,"" he said from a refugee camp in northern Idlib.
The Syrian government had recently announced plans to launch a major military offensive on the province, long controlled by various armed opposition groups, after managing to claw back swaths of rebel-held territory across the country.
The most recent offensives launched to reclaim Eastern Ghouta and Deraa killed hundreds of civilians, despite their inclusion in the de-escalation deal agreed upon by Turkey, and Assad's allies Russia and Iran at a meeting in Kazakhstan's capital, Astana, last year.
Both Russia and Turkey are considered guarantors of the most recent agreement to establish a demilitarised zone, though the two countries back different sides in the conflict.
While Russia and Iran back al-Assad, Turkey has been a constant supporter of the moderate opposition throughout the Syrian conflict, now in its eighth year.
""As civilians, our trust is in Turkey [to maintain the latest agreement],"" Daoud said from the Atma refugee camp.
Turkey has been trying to avoid an assault on Idlib by utilising pledges made via the Astana diplomatic track to maintain a lasting ceasefire. Its troops have been based in Idlib's border areas since May, as well as in Syria's Afrin and al-Bab following military operations against Kurdish fighters in Syria's north.
For the past few months, Turkey, which borders Idlib, has been attempting to align rebel groups in the province with its command. Key factions in the province announced last month the formation of a new coalition with some 60,000 fighters.
But now Turkey must work ""harder"" at dissolving HTS, Kabalan said.
""This issue [of radical groups] will always remain as a ticking bomb within this agreement because Russia and the regime will always be using their presence as a pretext to apply more pressure on Turkey,"" he said.
The Turkish-aligned coalition of moderate fighters excludes Hay'et Tahrir al-Sham, which controls about 60 percent of the province, and two other smaller ""radical"" groups, Kabalan explained.
It is unclear how these fighters will react to the deal's conditions of disarming and moving further north, which has raised new fears among Idlib's residents who say certain factions may be unwilling to relinquish control of the new zone and give up their arms.
""We're still confused. We're not sure how this agreement is going to play out,"" Hikmat al-Alis, 25, told Al Jazeera from the town of Ariha.
""With HTS asked to remain outside of the new zone, will this mean the start of a new battle?""
Fears of Hay'et Tahrir al-Sham launching attacks from border areas have also had civilians consider the consequences of rebel infighting.
According to Kabalan, Turkey is attempting to persuade ""radical groups"" to comply with the agreement, threatening any pushback may result in a military operation.
If these groups do not comply, a Turkish-Russian understanding may leave HTS, formerly al-Nusra Front, facing the consequence of a coalition attack.
""That would mean the moderate opposition aligned to Turkey would force al-Nusra to comply with the terms of the agreement,"" Kabalan said, warning another ""bloodbath"" could ensue.
The agreement may also falter if there is a shift in power.
The US military presence in Syria's northeast, where it backs Kurdish fighters, may pose a threat to government forces.
""The Russians believe the US would attack the regime if a big number of civilian casualties arise,"" Kabalan said.
Fears of a potential chemical attack are particularly high, which has lead Idlib's residents creating gas masks from paper cups.
""We fear the use of chemical weapons the most, which could break the [new] fragile agreement,"" Rayyan Abdulrahman, 28, told Al Jazeera from Idlib city.
The US has warned the Syrian government against the use of chemical weapons and threatened another military response.
In April, Washington and its allies responded to the Syrian government's alleged use of chemical weapons against rebels in the town of Douma with a barrage of missile strikes.
But Russia has repeatedly rejected these claims and recently said rebels are preparing to stage a chemical attack in Idlib to provoke a response from the West.
At this stage of the war, it is in Russia's interest to maintain the Astana process in an attempt to push a political solution in line with its goals.
""As long as Russia needs Turkey in Syria, they will try to honour this agreement,"" Kabalan said.

Those being moved out of the Moria camp - which houses 9,000 people in a facility built for 3,100 - will be sent to the mainland so their asylum claims can be examined, government spokesman Dimitris Tzanakopoulos said on Tuesday.
""The situation in Moria is indeed difficult, it is indeed at the limit,"" Tzanakopoulos said.
Regional governor Christina Kalogirou slammed conditions at the camp, which has raw sewage running out of its main entrance, and threatened to shut down the facility unless conditions improved.
Doctors Without Borders (MSF) called for the emergency evacuation of vulnerable people to the mainland and other European Union countries, citing an increase in suicide attempts and self-harm among children in Moria, as well as cases of sexual attacks.
""This is the third year that MSF has been calling on the Greek authorities and the EU to take responsibility for their collective failures and to put in place sustainable solutions to avoid this catastrophic situation,"" said Louise Roland-Gosselin, MSF's head of mission in Greece.
""It is time to immediately evacuate the most vulnerable to safe accommodation in other European countries and to stop this never-ending cycle of emergency decongestions and the horrendous conditions we continue to witness in Moria.""
Some 3,000 people were transferred from Moria to the mainland over the summer and another 700 people were moved last week, Tzanakopoulos said. A further 2,000 will be moved by the end of September.
Thousands of people fleeing violence and poverty at home are still arriving at Greek islands from the nearby Turkish coast.
Between Friday and Sunday, more than 600 reached Lesbos alone.
Under a 2016 deal between the EU and Turkey designed to halt the flow of refugees into Europe, those arriving on Greek islands are held in detention camps there and face deportation back to Turkey unless their asylum applications are approved.
But the massive backlog of applications has led to severe overcrowding on the Greek island camps, even as authorities move hundreds of vulnerable people to the mainland.
""What the Greek government is trying to do is to reduce the time required for a decision to be issued granting or rejecting asylum... But there is always reality,"" Tzanakopoulos said.
""We try to strike a balance between respecting human rights ... and trying to decongest as far as possible the islands.""
However, he stressed that the issue of immigration could only be solved if all European countries agreed to take in some of the asylum-seekers. Some EU nations - especially the Visegrad Group of Hungary, Poland, Czech Republic, and Slovakia - have mostly refused to take in refugees.
""The only way for an overall solution to the immigration crisis is an equal and proportional sharing of refugees throughout Europe. And for as long as the Visegrad countries insist on their anti-European, anti-humanitarian and, in my opinion, illegal approach to European decisions, the problem will persist,"" Tzanakopoulos said.
Further to the east, Cyprus has been seeing an increase in the number of people arriving there to claim asylum.
Interior Minister Constantinos Petrides said it's ""impossible"" for Cyprus, a divided island nation with more than one million people, to absorb large numbers of refugees.

The cap, announced on Monday, is a sharp drop from a limit of 45,000 the US set for this year, which was about half the number of refugees admitted to the country in 2016.
""We proposed resettling up to 30,000 refugees under the new refugee ceiling as well as processing more than 280,000 asylum seekers,"" Pompeo said in an announcement at the State Department, calling the US ""the most generous nation in the world when it comes to protection-based immigration.""
""This year's proposed refugee ceiling must be considered in the context of the many other forms of protection and assistance offered by the United States,"" he said.
Refugee advocates quickly condemned the lower cap.
""Today's announcement … is a shameful abdication of our humanity in the face of the worst refugee crisis in history,"" Jennifer Quigley, of Human Rights First, said in a statement.
Democratic Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal called the new cap ""outrageous"".
""The Trump administration already accepted a historically low amount of refugees,"" Jayapal tweeted.
The Trump administration already accepted a historically low amount of refugees. These new restrictions are outrageous. I came here at age 16 as an immigrant and today I am a congresswoman. Who could these refugees fleeing violence be if we gave them the chance? https://t.co/eGqVKMEt1U
Ryan Mace, a grassroots advocacy and refugee specialist at Amnesty International, said the announcement ""demonstrates another undeniable political attack against people who have been forced to flee their homes.""
He added in a statement: ""This is the lowest goal in the history of the programme, and compounded by this administration's history of creating road block after road block for refugees to arrive, this must be perceived as an all-out attack against our country's ability to resettle refugees both now and in the future.""
Pompeo said the new limit reflected the administration's preference for settling refugees closer to their home countries, something President Donald Trump has said would be cheaper than admitting them to the United States.
Pompeo said the decision was also based on security concerns. ""We must continue to responsibly vet applicants to prevent the entry of those who might do harm to our country,"" he said.
The refugee ceiling of 45,000 set last year was the lowest since 1980, when the modern refugee programme was established. The US is on track to admit only 22,000 refugees this year, about half the maximum allowed.
Trump campaigned in 2016 promising tight restrictions on immigration, and his administration has sharply reduced refugee admissions through executive orders and closed-door decisions in the past year and a half.
In the last year, the administration has tightened security vetting procedures that current and former officials say have slowed admission of refugees.
In addition to far lower admissions overall, the type of refugee admitted has changed under Trump, a Reuters analysis of government data shows. The percentage who are Muslim is now a third what it was two years ago; the percentage who are Europeans has tripled.
The shift has led to striking imbalances. Refugees admitted to the US from the small European country of Moldova, for example, now outnumber those from Syria by three to one, although the number of Syrian refugees worldwide outnumbers the total population of Moldova.

Hans-Georg Maassen will become a senior official at the interior ministry once he leaves the BfV agency, the government said in a statement on Tuesday.
The move, which was derided by commentators a face-saving measure that amounted to nothing less than a promotion, lets Merkel's fourth-term government live to see another day.
The chancellor's Social Democratic coalition partners had insisted on Maassen's departure as head of the BfV intelligence service, against the wishes of Interior Minister Horst Seehofer from her Bavarian CSU sister party.
Maassen was at the centre of a heated controversy after he raised doubts about the veracity of reports of far-right hooligans and neo-Nazis randomly attacking immigrants in the eastern city of Chemnitz in late August.
The far-right attacks in Chemnitz, which caused revulsion in Germany, were triggered by the fatal stabbing of a man over which police are holding a Syrian suspect and searching for an Iraqi man. A court freed another initial Iraqi suspect on Tuesday. Days after the attacks, Maassen questioned the authenticity of amateur video footage showing street violence and voiced doubt that racists had indeed ""hunted down"" foreigners - comments that directly contradicted Merkel, who had deplored the xenophobic attacks and ""hatred in the streets"". SPD leaders - as well as the opposition Greens, Free Democrats and Linke parties - had demanded the resignation or sacking of the spy chief for political meddling, and pointed to his repeated meetings with leaders of the anti-immigration Alternative for Germany (AfD) party.
""Maassen is no longer the top spy. This is good. But it is a farce that he is practically being promoted and that the SPD is going along with this,"" said Dietmar Bartsch of the hard-left Die Linke party.
""This government has reached its end. It is an emergency government of the election losers.""
The news comes amid a deep rift between Merkel and Seehofer, whose own political future hangs in the balance as his CSU braces for potentially massive losses to the AfD in Bavarian state elections next month.
Seehofer recently labelled the migration issue ""the mother of all problems"" in German politics - a comment read by many as a veiled reference to Merkel's nickname ""Mutti"", or Mummy.
In its statement on Tuesday, the government said ""Seehofer values [Maassen's] competence in the questions of public security.""
""Mr Maassen will not be responsible for supervising the BfV at the ministry.""

The move on Monday comes amid deteriorating ties between the two sides in the wake of US President Donald Trump's controversial recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital last year and the relocation of its embassy there.
That decision drew universal condemnation from Arab leaders and criticism around the world, while Palestinian leaders, who see East Jerusalem as the capital of their future state, said the US had taken itself ""off the table"" as a peace mediator.
Since Trump took office on January 20, 2017, Israel - a traditional US ally that receives $3.1bn in annual military aid from Washington (next year, that figure will increase to $3.8bn under a 10-year deal agreed by former US President Barack Obama) - has taken a series of measures that have been criticised as ""racist"" and ""discriminatory"" against the Palestinian people.
Trump is meanwhile expected to unveil details of what he has long referred to as the ""deal of the century"" to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. According to reports, the deal prohibits the return of more than five million Palestinian refugees and removes the status of Jerusalem from negotiations.
Mouin Rabbani, a resident senior fellow at the Institute for Palestine Studies in Washington, DC, told Al Jazeera the Trump administration has largely been guided by Israel with regards to the Palestine question.
""The measures adopted by the United States with respect towards the Palestinians during the past year have several sources: exceptional ignorance, ideological zealotry, internalisation of guidance from Israeli counterparts as sound policy for the United States, keeping funders and supporters onside, and not least the arrogance of power,"" he said.
While Rabbani noted that the US decision to terminate funding of UNRWA is couched in ""political retribution"" against the Palestinian leadership's refusal to comply with Trump's embrace of the Israeli agenda, getting rid of the UN refugee agency will not be successful.
""Washington's stated objectives of compelling the United Nations to redefine Palestinian refugees so that their status is collectively transformed to non-refugees, and to eliminate UNRWA altogether will however fail, because there is insufficient support for these objectives, even among its closest international and regional allies,"" he said.
Here is a timeline of key US decisions regarding Palestinians since Trump assumed office.
February 16: Trump drops the long-standing US commitment to a two-state solution, says he would back a single-state solution after meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
March 24: US Senate approves the appointment of David Friedman, a supporter and donor to illegal settlements on occupied Palestinian land, as Washington's ambassador to Israel.
December 6: Trump announces a controversial decision to relocate US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, formally recognises Jerusalem as Israel's capital, breaking with decades of US policy.
January 3: Trump threatens to cut aid to the Palestinians in a series of Twitter posts, citing their unwillingness ""to talk peace"".
January 17: US government cuts more than half its planned funding ($65m out of a $125m aid package) to UNRWA, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees that caters to more than five million registered refugees.
May 14: US embassy officially opens in Jerusalem on the same day Palestinians commemorate 70 years since the Nakba or ""Catastrophe"", the ethnic cleansing of Palestinian cities and towns by Zionist paramilitaries in 1948 - also the eve of when the state of Israel was established.
August 19: Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, who was tasked along with envoy Jason Greenblatt with reviving the stalled peace process in 2017, embarks on Middle East tour to build support for the yet-to-be-announced Israeli-Palestinian peace plan.
August 25: US cuts $200m economic aid to the Palestinians after it had planned to provide $251m for good governance, health, education and funding for civil society in the current 2018 budget.
September 9: US slashes one of its last remaining aid programmes ($25m in financial assistance) to a network of six hospitals in occupied East Jerusalem.
September 10: US closes the PLO mission to Washington, DC, over Palestinian Authority's refusal to enter into US-led talks with Israel.
September 17: US revokes visas for the PLO envoy and his family in Washington, DC, causing them to leave the country.
September 17: US cuts $10m in aid for programmes on conflict resolution, designed to bring reconciliation for Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza, as well as between Jewish and Palestinian citizens of Israel.

Pakistan is home to more than 1.39 million registered Afghan refugees, according to United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), many of whom have been resident in the country for more than 30 years.
There are also more than 200,000 ethnic Bangladeshis in Pakistan, most of whom live in the southern city of Karachi. Many of them were stranded in the city after the war in 1971 when Bangladesh, then East Pakistan, gained independence.
Afghan refugees, meanwhile, have poured into Pakistan from its western neighbour for decades, first fleeing the Soviet invasion in the 1970s, and then the civil war that ensued.
Since 2001, a fresh influx of refugees followed the US invasion of Afghanistan, and the subsequent Taliban war to take back the country.
""These poor migrants from Bangladesh, they have been here for more than 40 years, their children are grown now … we will give them passports and ID cards, as well as those Afghans whose children have been raised here, who were born here, we will also give them [citizenship],"" said Khan in Karachi on Sunday.
""This happens in every country in the world, why is it that here we are inflicting such an injustice on these people?""
The announcement is a marked departure from the policy followed by previous governments, and could see the prime minister face confrontation with the country's powerful military, which has often blamed Afghan refugees for violence in Pakistan.
Pakistani law allows citizenship for all those born in the country, with the exception of children of foreign diplomats, ""enemy aliens"" and those who migrated away from territories that became Pakistan after the partition of the subcontinent in 1947.
The legal status of Afghan refugees resident in Pakistan expires on September 30, although it is widely expected to be extended by the government, as has been done numerous times in the past.
Repatriation of refugees
The UNHCR welcomed the development, but said it was awaiting specifics on how Khan's government intended to move forward.
""UNHCR welcomes the statement on Afghan children born in Pakistan,"" spokesperson Dan McNorton told Al Jazeera. ""We look forward to working closely with the government of Pakistan on this issue in the coming weeks.""
The Afghan government did not immediately comment.
Since 2014, Pakistan has been actively encouraging the repatriation of Afghan refugees, with the numbers of refugees returning spiking during that year.
Rights groups say Pakistani authorities have carried out a sustained campaign of intimidation and harassment of refugees since a 2014 attack on a Peshawar school killed more than 140 people, an attack that Pakistan blames groups based in Afghanistan for.
The rate of repatriation dropped last year, as violence spiked and the Afghan Taliban stepped up their attacks on civilian targets across the country.
This year, at least 9,821 Afghan refugees have repatriated to their homeland, according to UNHCR data. Birth rates among the refugee community, however, are high, and at least 14,682 Afghan refugee births were also recorded during the same period, the data shows.
Relations between the two neighbours have remained tense for years, with Afghanistan blaming Pakistan for hosting the Afghan Taliban leadership and its allies, a claim that Pakistan denies.
Pakistan claims Afghanistan has not acted against the Pakistan Taliban, which it claims is based in eastern Afghanistan.
On Saturday, Pakistani Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi led a high-level delegation on a visit to Kabul, with both sides pledging their commitment to a new comprehensive dialogue framework.

""As for military intervention to overthrow the Nicolas Maduro regime, I think we should not rule out any option, because definitively, the Nicolas Maduro regime is perpetrating crimes against humanity towards its population, and violations of human rights,"" said Almagro.

""The Lima Group rejected the military intervention against Venezuela and left Luis Almagro, slavish agent of the Empire, all alone with his coup plotting obsession,"" tweeted the Bolivian head of state, Evo Morales, on Sunday.
""It is a defeat of Trump's interventionism and a victory of dignity and courage of Venezuela and Latin America,"" he added.
The Venezuelan government announced it would appeal to the UN and other international bodies to take action against Almagro.
""Almagro attacks Latin America and the Caribbean... intends to revive the worst military intervention on the continent,"" said Vice President Delcy Rodriguez.
The idea of resolving Venezuela's crisis by changing the regime has always been rejected throughout the region.
Almagro's threat of military force is surprising as he previously condemned the region's support for a US invasion of the Dominican Republic in 1965 in order to remove a democratically elected president.
The invasion, carried out in the OAS' name, left thousands dead and generated resentment against the idea of using force against sovereign nations.
In 2015, Almagro apologised for the OAS' role in the invasion, saying such events should never be repeated. The region has not had a full-scale war in more than five decades.
Almagro's comments came after his three-day visit to neighbouring Colombia where a wave of migrants has fled to from oil-rich but impoverished Venezuela.
Almost a million Venezuelans are currently living in Colombia, according to the government, but the real number is likely higher.
""We haven't had anything to eat for four days,"" Eric Aparicio, a Venezuelan migrant trying to cross into Colombia, told Al Jazeera. ""We bring metal and plastic, I don't know how much I will make with this but at least enough for a piece of bread.""
Governments initially welcomed the migrants with open arms, remembering Venezuela's role in welcoming those fleeing dictatorships and conflicts in the past.
But the exodus has ballooned this year, stretching social services, creating more competition for low-skilled jobs and stoking fears of unrest.

Mardini and her sister Yusra, who went on to swim in the 2016 Olympics, were subsequently lauded as heroes and gained international notoriety.
She went on to work with the Emergency Response Centre International (ERCI), a nonprofit organisation on Lesbos, before eventually continuing their journey to Germany. In late 2017, she returned to Lesbos to volunteer with ERCI again.
But now 23-year-old Mardini is behind bars in Korydallos Prison, a high-security facility in the capital, Athens, and three of her ERCI colleagues have been arrested, as well.
Authorities arrested them on August 21 and dealt them daunting charges ranging from people smuggling to espionage and membership in a criminal organisation. Under Greek law, they can be held in pre-trial detention for up to 18 months.
Greek police detained Mardini at the island's airport as she prepared to travel back to Germany for university studies.
Her lawyer, Haris Petsalnikos, maintains that she was not in Greece during many of the incidents detailed in the allegations and has called for her release.
The accused individuals include ERCI field director Nassos Karakitsos, a Greek citizen, and volunteer Sean Binder, a 24-year-old German national. A third individual who was charged has requested that his name be withheld, according to the organisation.
In a press release, Greek police said the NGO facilitated ""the illegal entry of aliens into Greek territory"" and provided ""direct assistance to organised illegal immigration networks"".
The statement added that police are investigating 30 individuals in connection to the case, which includes allegations of human trafficking, money laundering, spying and counterfeiting, among others.
A week after the arrests, the ERCI published a statement dismissing the ""unfounded claims, charges and accusations"".
Panos Moraitis, a 39-year-old Greek national who founded the ERCI in December 2015, said he plans to present himself to authorities in Lesbos in the coming days and expects to be arrested, as well.
Rejecting the allegations, Moraitis explained that he decided to join a swell of volunteers heading to Greek islands as the refugee crisis unfolded in 2015.
Each morning, while commuting to work, he would listen to the radio and hear updates from Lesbos as tens of thousands of refugees reached the island. ""I heard the news every morning, and I saw the photos,"" he recalled, speaking to Al Jazeera by telephone.
""What really tipped me over was what convinced thousands of people to volunteer: the photo of Aylan Kurdi,"" he recalled, referring to a Syrian toddler whose lifeless body washed up on Turkish shores in September 2015.
At the time, images of Kurdi went viral and made international headlines.
""My wife was pregnant with my daughter then, and I knew I had to do something,"" Moraitis said.
Advocates say the arrests are part of a broader wave of clamping down on volunteers, aid workers and activists who have worked with refugees and migrants fleeing warzones and economic devastation in the Middle East, Africa, and South Asia.
In 2016, Greek police arrested a pair of Spanish activists who were attempting to help transport refugees from the country, in the port city of Igoumenitsa.
In March, Italian authorities launched an investigation into Proactiva Open Arms and seized a rescue ship, accusing three individuals of criminal activities related to facilitating migration to the country.
Two months later, three Spanish firefighters were put on trial for helping refugees enter the EU on Lesbos. Those charges could land them behind bars for 10 years.
In Hungary, far-right Prime Minister Viktor Orban's government passed into law in June a measure prohibiting individuals and NGOs from providing aid to refugees and migrants entering the Central European country.
Nassim Lomani, an Athens-based activist who came to Europe from Afghanistan two decades ago, said the effort to crack down on rescue workers, NGOs and refugee solidarity activists comes at a time when the EU seeks to stem the flow of refugees and migrants to the continent.
""It's getting worse,"" he told Al Jazeera, ""and I have the feeling it will continue to get much worse.""
In recent months, several European countries, among them Germany, Austria and Italy, have sought to limit the entry and movement of asylum seekers.
Last month, Germany struck a deal with Greece to return asylum seekers to the Mediterranean country if it was their first port of entry into the bloc.
In Italy, the newly appointed far-right interior minister, Matteo Salvini, has prompted outrage across the continent by refusing to allow refugee boats to disembark on the country's shores.
In late August, Salvini initially blocked a boat carrying some 177 people from unloading, leading to a nearly week-long standoff.
But in Greece, boats continue to arrive, despite declining living standards in the overcrowded camps, particularly on the islands, and the apparent attempts to discourage rescue workers and activists.
According to the United Nations refugee agency (UNHCR), more than 21,000 refugees and migrants have reached Greece in 2018, a number that pales in comparison to the nearly million who passed through the country three years earlier.
On Thursday, the Greek coastguard retrieved 65 people on a boat in the Mediterranean near southwestern Greece, according to the local daily Ekathimerini.
Arrivals have also swelled on the country's land border with Turkey, where a growing number of people cross the Evros River to enter Greece.
Meanwhile, with the charges pending against four of its members, the ERCI has suspended all its operations indefinitely.
Among those services was a clinic in Moria, a cramped refugee camp on Lesbos, and programmes in the nearby Karatepe camp.
""Based on what I've seen till now, our people are being prosecuted for doing nothing wrong,"" Moraitis said.
""It feels like the authorities want to make an example out of us to scare others from doing search-and-rescue,"" he concluded.
""In the end, they [authorities] will say, 'Oops, our bad,' but lives will have been ruined already.""

""Everyone's common point is that the solution must be political rather than military,"" Ibrahim Kalin said in the capital Ankara, after a preparatory meeting with representatives of France, Germany and Russia in advance of an upcoming four-party summit on Syria.
Kalin said that there is a general consensus that the consequences of a full-scale military attack on Idlib will cause humanitarian crises and a new wave of refugees.
He said on Friday that his government seeks to maintain Idlib's current status, protect civilians, and prevent a humanitarian crisis in Idlib.
""Of course, a new wave of migration would not only put a burden on Turkey. It could cause a new chain of crises from here to Europe. Therefore, nobody wants this,"" he stressed.
The bombing of Idlib will be ""unacceptable,"" the presidential spokesperson said.
""Our expectation here from the international community and the leaders is that they give more open and clear support to Turkey,"" he added.
He also added that Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's upcoming visit to the Russian city of Sochi on Monday and efforts afterwards were of high importance.
Since the beginning of September, at least 30 civilians have been killed in Idlib and Hama, and dozens injured, by air raids and attacks by the Syrian government and Russian warplanes, according to activists on the ground.
Damascus has recently announced plans to launch a major military offensive to the area, long controlled by various armed opposition groups.
The UN warns that such an offensive would lead to the ""worst humanitarian catastrophe in the 21st century.""
Thousands of people have taken to the streets across Idlib on Friday to protest against a potential full-fledged offensive by government forces and their allies.
Activists told Al Jazeera that Friday's demonstrations took place in more than two dozen towns and villages in the province that is home to more than three million people.
In early September, the forces loyal to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad launched an intense campaign of shelling, air raids and barrel-bombing of opposition-held territories. The Russian-backed bombardment has receded over the past few days.

A Turkish military convoy arrived at a Turkish outpost near the town of Morek, in Syria's northern Hama province, early on Thursday.
Al Jazeera also observed the arrival of a military plane that unloaded dozens of Turkish soldiers at the civilian airport in Hatay province, about 50km from the Turkish-Syrian border. It was not immediately clear whether the troops were heading across the border.
Turkey already hosts 3.5 million Syrian refugees and is fearful of another major influx if Syrian forces - backed by Russian airpower and allied militias - attack the last remaining stronghold of opposition fighters in Idlib province.
According to Metin Gurcan, a Turkish security expert, the border reinforcement was a defensive measure.
""If you look at the types of those weapons systems, I would say they are all for defensive purposes. So I don't think Turkey has offensive intention and capability to militarily intervene in the Idlib conundrum,"" he told Al Jazeera.
""This is sort of the preventive, defensive military buildup to manage the anticipated refugee flow because of this push of Russia-backed Syrian forces from the south.""
Nearly 40,000 people have already fled Idlib after Syrian-Russian air attacks intensified over the last two weeks. The UN estimates, in a worst-case scenario, about 900,000 civilians could flee Idlib if a full-scale ground offensive begins.
This big bird just landed in Hatay and unloaded a few dozen soldiers. #Idlib pic.twitter.com/2PxQmWyXmL
Turkish officials have repeatedly warned Russia and the Syrian government against attacking Idlib, saying it would lead to another massive wave of refugees heading towards Turkey.
Over the past week, Turkey has deployed reinforcements and expanded defensive structures at about a dozen observation points across opposition-held territories in Idlib, western Aleppo, and northern Hama provinces.
The outposts were established after a de-escalation agreement was reached between Turkey, Russia, and Iran in July 2017.
Areas in Deraa and Homs provinces and the suburb of Eastern Ghouta were also part of the de-escalation deal, but over the past few months, they have been captured by Syrian government forces backed by the Russian air force and pro-Iranian militias.
On September 7, a ceasefire proposed by Turkey was rejected by Russia and Iran during a summit among the three countries in Tehran.
A confrontation between Turkish forces and those backing the Syrian government are ""highly unlikely"" if the offensive on Idlib goes forward, said Gurkan.
Russia continues to control Syria's airspace, he noted, and Turkey is unlikely to initiate any military action there without Russian approval.
""I don't expect a large-scale ground offensive [by Syrian forces]. It is going to a gradual, incremental siege warfare that could last maybe nine to 10 months,"" said Gurkan.
He added Turkey was unlikely to withdraw its observation points manned by its troops if heavy fighting begins.
""These are Russia-endorsed observation posts, the prime objective of which is to prevent the expansion of pro-Iranian Shia militias from Aleppo to Idlib,"" he said.
According to Gurkan, Russia also wants to limit Iranian influence in Syria and prevent it from spreading into Idlib province.

Guterres said on Tuesday that preventing a full-scale battle in Syria's northern Idlib province was ""absolutely essential"".
""This would unleash a humanitarian nightmare unlike any seen in the blood-soaked Syrian conflict.""
The UN chief said it was especially important for Syria's two main backers, Iran and Russia, to ""find a way in which it is possible to isolate terrorist group and … create a situation in which civilians will not be the price paid to solve the problem in Idlib"".
The government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and its allies has been preparing a large-scale military onslaught to capture Idlib which hosts some three million people.
Air raids and shelling of southern Idlib and northern Hama provinces escalated over the past week after Moscow and Tehran rejected a Turkish ceasefire proposal at a trilateral summit held in the Iranian capital, Tehran, on September 7.
The renewed bombing campaign led to the flight of more than 30,000 people from the rebel-held areas since the beginning of this month, according to the United Nations.
In a Tuesday article published in the Wall Street Journal, Turkey's president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, echoed the UN's concerns about a potential humanitarian crisis, adding that an attack on the last rebel-held province would affect Turkey, Europe and beyond.
Erdogan, who met his Russian and Iranian counterparts at the Tehran summit last week, also said Russia and Iran had a responsibility to stop a potential humanitarian disaster in Idlib.

With 448 votes in favour, 197 against and 48 abstentions, the motion passed in the plenary session on Wednesday, the first time ever the European legislature triggered an Article 7 procedure against an EU member state.
The unprecedented vote could allow Hungary's EU voting rights to be stripped.
Dutch Greens MEP Judith Sargentini, who spearheaded the vote, smiled broadly and breathed a sigh of relief before embracing her supporters in parliament in the French city of Strasbourg.
""It is a positive sign of this parliament taking responsibility and wanting action,"" Sargentini told a press conference afterward.
She had urged colleagues not to let Hungary off the hook, declaring that Orban's rule ""violates the values on which this union was built"".
EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said before the vote that the commission ""will resist all attacks on the rule of law"" in an annual state-of-the-union speech in the European Parliament.
Juncker went on to say the commission, which proposes EU legislation and oversees implementation of decisions, ""continues to be very concerned by the developments"" in some EU member states and promised to employ the rule-of-law procedure against any governments that veer from the EU's democratic principles.
Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto wasted little time in slamming the vote as ""nothing less than the petty revenge of pro-immigration politicians"".
""This decision condemning Hungary and the Hungarian people was made because we Hungarians have demonstrated that migration in not a necessary process and that migration can be stopped,"" Szijjarto told reporters in Budapest.
Since sweeping to power in 2010, Orban has pressured courts, media, and non-governmental groups, as well as refusing to take in asylum seekers arriving in Europe.
Though the EU has often protested, it largely failed to stop what his critics decry as Orban's growing authoritarianism.
But a surge in support for nationalist and populist politicians across the bloc galvanised a stronger reaction. Speaking in front of the assembly on Tuesday, Orban said he would not bow to the EU's ""blackmail"" and stick to his policies.
The vote was hailed as ""historic"" by Berber Biala-Hettinga, Amnesty International's expert on human rights in the EU.
""The European Parliament rightly stood up for the Hungarian people and for the EU. They made it clear that human rights, the rule of law and democratic values are not up for negotiation,"" she said.
In June, Hungary's parliament overwhelmingly passed a law imposing jail terms for anybody seen to be aiding undocumented immigrants.
The law targets rights groups and NGOs and allows banning of organisations.
In addition to the bill, the parliament also passed a constitutional amendment stating an ""alien population"" cannot be settled in Hungary.
Szijjarto said Hungary was considering legal options to appeal the result because of the way the vote was tallied.
He also claimed the vote involved ""massive fraud"" since abstentions weren't counted into the final tally, which made it easier to reach the needed two-thirds majority.
Uli Brueckner, a professor of European studies at Stanford University in Berlin, told Al Jazeera the vote was made because of Hungary's ""misfunctioning democracy"".
""In a populous agenda, it is always useful to play the blame-game, and the blame-game here is 'we are afraid of foreigners'. It is always useful to play a blame-game. It instrumentalises people's fears,"" Brueckner said of the government's policies.
Aside from its anti-immigrant stance, Orban's government is also accused of silencing independent media and academia, removing independent judges, cracking down on organisations helping homeless people, migrants or disadvantaged groups, such as Roma, and condoning government corruption.
The vote means the other EU states must now look at what to do with Hungary.
The most severe punishment under the Article 7 procedure is stripping Hungary of its voting rights in the EU. However, that move is highly unlikely as the rest of the EU needs unanimity.
Poland's nationalist and anti-immigration government - against which the EU Commission has slowly enacted Article 7 procedures over the last two years over concerns about the independence of its judiciary - is expected to block any tough action against Orban.
""Poland is very worried by the decision taken by parliament today,"" Joanna Kopcinska, spokeswoman for Poland's ruling Law and Justice party, told AFP news agency.
Kopcinska said the vote threatens the EU's unity. ""It is necessary to resolve such disputes through dialogue and not diktat,"" she said.

Researchers found that 94 percent of refugees surveyed in the city said they slept rough, while 73 percent said they did not get enough to eat every day.
Hundreds of refugees live near the Gare du Nord railway station and Maximilian Park in central Brussels, without access to basic services, the report by RRE said.
The vast majority of the 118 refugees and migrants surveyed by RRE want to reach the UK.
However, the closure of the ""jungle"" camp by authorities in Calais, France, 175km West of Brussels, which previously served as a transit point for refugees trying to enter Britain, has complicated the journey.
The camp was home to around 10,000 refugees when it was razed by officials in October 2016 and many of those displaced remain in the surrounding region, living in squats, shelters, and makeshift camps.
""Repeated evictions of Maximilian Park and Gare du Nord are compounded by poor living conditions, an acute lack of sanitation, and a problematic absence of accessible information about the asylum systems in Belgium and Britain,"" said Marta Welander, the Executive Director at Refugee Rights Europe.
""The combination of these factors creates a situation of immense hardship and precarity facing displaced people in Brussels, right in the heart of Europe,"" she added.
Some of those surveyed said they faced heavy-handed treatment by the police officers, including the confiscation of belongings, including clothes and shoes.
In May 2018, a two-year-old Kurdish child was killed by Belgian police when they opened fire on a van carrying refugees and migrants in an apparent attempt to stop it.
The report said women and children were particularly vulnerable to exploitation and trafficking, with little access to information about their rights.
""We met a significant number of women and girls, who are exposed to heightened risk of violence and abuse during their time in displacement,"" said Fee Mira Gerlach, a field researcher and coordinator of the study.
As well as the hardships that come with living rough and allegations of mistreatment by police, refugees and migrants also described the casual racism they face.
One 55-year-old refugee from Kuwait said: ""When I was in a train a passenger said, 'What are you doing here in my country? Get out of here!""
Though numbers are smaller than in Greece and other European countries along the refugee route, northern France and Belgium are home to thousands of refugees and migrants trying to reach Britain.
Calais' port and undersea rail tunnel connecting the European continent to the island, are popular routes for those hoping to enter Britain.
That popularity, combined with stringent border patrols, has meant thousands remain on the European mainland, hoping to one day reach the UK.
Many have ended up spending years in France and Belgium.

If the so-called ""Article 7"" of the Lisbon Treaty is triggered, it would set in motion a process that could lead to sanctions such as a suspension of Hungary's voting rights in the EU, and put the bloc on a collision course with Orban, who on Tuesday vowed to defy the vote.
""Whatever your decision will be, Hungary will not accede to this blackmail. Hungary will protect its borders, stop illegal migration, and defend its rights,"" Orban told the European parliament.
""Hungary is going to be condemned because Hungarian people have decided that this country is not going to be a country of migrants.""
Article 7 of the Lisbon Treaty was designed to dissuade EU member states from reverting to values Europe considers anti-democratic. The treaty, which was ratified by all 27-member states and came into force in 2009, governs the European Union following its expansion.
It is expected a majority of the 750-member legislative body will vote against Hungary. But it is still unclear if the required two-thirds majority threshold to enforce the motion will come to fruition.
The European Council - which comprises all heads of the 27-member states including Hungary - is then required to act ""by unanimity"" to determine the ""existence of a serious and persistent breach"" by a member state, and carry out sanctions.
Hungary has been in the crosshairs of the European Union after Orban put pressure on courts, media and non-government groups since coming to power in 2010.
Though the EU has often protested, it has largely failed to stop what Orban's critics decry as his growing authoritarian drive.
Orban's refusal to accept some of the Mediterranean arrivals overwhelming coastal states such as Italy has upset many of his EU peers, including Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras.
""Do you really believe that any country ... can survive on its own without help, without the solidarity and cooperation of other countries?"" he told the legislators.
""There can be no future for Europe like that.""
In June, Hungary's parliament overwhelmingly passed a law imposing jail terms on anybody seen to be aiding undocumented immigrants.
The law targets rights groups and NGOs and allows the banning of organisations.
In addition to the bill, the parliament also passed a constitutional amendment stating an ""alien population"" cannot be settled in Hungary.
Aside from its anti-immigrant stance, Orban's government is also accused of silencing independent media and academia, removing independent judges, cracking down on organisations helping homeless people, migrants or disadvantaged groups, such as Roma, and condoning government corruption.
At a time of growing anti-immigrant sentiment in Europe, the impending vote against Orban's government has sharply divided the bloc.
Italy's anti-immigration Interior Minister Matteo Salvini, whose League party has six legislators in the European body, said: ""We will vote in defence of Orban.""
Poland's ruling Law and Justice party, which stands accused of dismantling an independent judiciary at home, will also defend Hungary's prime minister.
But Orban's fellow migration hardliner, Austria's Chancellor Sebastian Kurz, surprised many by announcing plans to vote against Budapest.
""We believe that there can be no compromises on the rule of law and democracy,"" Kurz told ORF television.
The commission, headed by Jean-Claude Juncker, has repeatedly clashed with Orban's government especially after Budapest refused to admit asylum seekers under an EU scheme launched at the height of the refugee crisis in 2015.
Judith Sargentini, an EU parliamentarian from the Netherlands who spearheaded the vote, said the time had come to make an ""important choice"".
""Will you let it happen that a government ... violates the values on which this union was built without consequences? Or will you ensure that the values of this union are more than just words written on a piece of a paper?"" she said.
Hungary argues its anti-immigrant measures and defence of sovereign rights are in tune with the mood of European voters, who will elect a new parliament in Strasbourg next May.

The current government, formed as a coalition between the centre-left Social Democrats and Green Party after the 2014 elections, could be unseated owing to the growing popularity of the Sweden Democrats and right-wing Moderate Party.
Headed by incumbent prime minister Stefan Lofven, Social Democrats is Sweden's oldest party. While some polls suggest that it could remain the largest, challenges are mounting.
After months of rising support, Sweden Democrats is currently polling at 24.8 percent, making the anti-immigration party the largest in the field, according to a recent YouGov tally.
Nicholas Aylott, associate professor of political science at Sodertorn University
While confidence in the Social Democrats has slumped, the Left Party has reached nearly 10 percent in the polls and hopes to enter a potential coalition of left-leaning and progressive parties.
With anti-migrant, far-right and populist parties garnering strong performances across the European Union thus far in 2018, refugees have again become a central issue for voters.
The Riksdag, Sweden's parliament, has 349 seats, which are decided through a proportional vote. Of that total, the country's 29 constituencies will decide 310 seats, while the remaining seats are divvied up to match each party's share of the total national vote.
A party must receive at least four percent of votes to be assigned a seat.
Representatives from eight parties currently have the 349 seats - Social Democrats, Moderate Party, Sweden Democrats, Green Party, Centre Party, Left Party, Liberals and Christian Democrats.
While the centre-left is represented by Social Democrats and the Greens, a centre-right political alliance comprises the Moderates, Centre Party, Liberals and Christian Democrats. Both blocs are polling around 40 percent, with the left slightly in lead.
Sweden has had a historically high voter turnout, with more than 85 percent of eligible voters casting their votes during the 2014 elections. That year, more than 2.4 million people voted early.
This year, according to a preliminary tally, upwards of 7.6 million people - slightly more than half of them women - are registered to vote in the Riksdag elections.
Of that total, around 161,000 Swedes living abroad are eligible to vote.
But unlike many European countries, residents without Swedish citizenship are entitled to vote in municipal elections.
Sweden absorbed 163,000 asylum seekers in 2015, the onset of the refugee crisis, which saw upwards of a million refugees and migrants reach Europe.
Sweden's long-held reputation as a liberal bastion in Europe has been challenged by the recent rise of anti-refugee sentiment, which has prompted the current coalition to impose stricter measures on the asylum process and border control.
In May, the government announced plans to cut, almost by half, the number of refugees and migrants entering the country.
At the time, Immigration Minister Helene Fritzon said Sweden should accept between 14,000 and 15,000 refugees a year, as opposed to the 27,000 it took in last year.
""Even if the number of asylum seekers has dropped significantly in Sweden, it is significantly higher than [what it should be given] our population share in Europe,"" she told reporters at the time.
The Sweden Democrats, established in 1989, took just under 13 percent of the vote in 2014 and currently holds 42 seats in the Riksdag.
Campaigning on anti-refugee positions and a pledge to crack down on crime, the party's popularity has swelled during the lead-up to this year's elections.
In the past, critics have lambasted the Sweden Democrats' links to neo-Nazi and white nationalist groups, something its leader, Jimmie Akesson, has argued is no longer an issue.
In its official platform, the party says its anti-migrant policies are driven by ""love and confidence in our country"".
""If we are the second biggest or biggest party in parliament and the other parties still believe we can be ignored, and pretend we don't exist, then we must flex our muscles,"" Akesson told Reuters in an interview earlier this year.
While hardline calls to freeze migration drew fresh support, Sweden Democrats' promise to hold a potential EU referendum has been less popular.
Former Prime Minister Carl Bildt described the proposed referendum as ""the biggest single danger to Sweden's future prosperity"".
Nicholas Aylott, an associate professor of political science at Sodertorn University, said the rise of the Sweden Democrats reflects a ""disruption"" of the country's political tradition.
""[The] party system in the country has undergone change and is undergoing change,"" he told Al Jazeera. ""For decades, the whole of that period has been about left against right.""
Speaking of the Sweden Democrats potentially entering a coalition, he added: ""It would be an absolutely enormous change, a huge event in the country's political history.""
A wave of crime has impacted the election discourse, especially after the August 13 torching of some 80 vehicles in Gothenburg and other towns.
""Society will always act hard against this and we must continue to do so … We will do what needs to be done to take care of it and go in hard against this crime,"" Lofven, the prime minister, told Swedish radio at the time.
In the last two years, dozens of people have been killed in what was described as gang violence in Stockholm and other large cities.
According to official statistics, 129 shootings took place in Stockholm in 2017 and 19 people were killed, nearly twice the number of those who died in similar incidents the year before.
The government responded by calling for harsher punishment for gun crimes and sexual assault.
In early July, political leaders announced ""crisis talks"" with police over the escalating violence.
With fears of violence spreading, Sweden Democrats seized the opportunity to link immigration and crime, arguing migrants are responsible for the rise.
In its online platform, the party argues that ""serious crimes should [receive] severe punishment and that foreign citizens who commit crimes in Sweden should be expelled"".
Climate change thrust into the public discourse after the country endured wildfires and record temperatures throughout the summer.
The Green Party, which entered a coalition with the Social Democrats after the 2014 elections, has pushed for environmentally friendly policies and measures against climate change during the last four years.
By 2050, Sweden hopes to create a society with no net greenhouse gas emissions, and the country leads the EU in climate ranking, according to an international survey published in June.
The Sweden Democrats expressed scepticism, and its leader, Akesson, criticised other politicians for calling for extensive measures after what he described as ""one summer"" of hot weather.
The far-right party has also vowed to introduce cheaper petrol prices.
Other key issues in the election include healthcare, education and the country's social welfare system.

In order to establish its authority, the GNA sought the support of a handful of militias already active in the city.
The gradual rise of these Tripoli-based armed groups, which kept their autonomy as they began dominating the formal security institutions, including the interior ministry, angered powerful militias outside the capital who felt marginalised and at risk of losing access to state funds.
Last week, fierce clashes broke out between groups from outside the capital and Tripoli-based militias, killing dozens of people and wounding many more.
The renewed fighting not only laid bare Tripoli's fragile security situation and GNA's powerlessness but also pushed major international powers - already at odds over how to resolve the long-running conflict - to change their tone.
In a speech at the Security Council on Wednesday, Ghassane Salame, the UN envoy to Libya, warned of the threat ""predatory"" armed groups pose to the country's transition process.
""Indeed, members of some armed groups nominally acting under the Ministry of Interior have kidnapped, tortured and murdered employees of sovereign institutions, including the National Oil Corporation and the Libyan Investment Authority,"" said Salame.
""Our public criticism of the predatory behaviour of armed groups in the capital was warmly welcomed by Libyans, who are fed up with living on the poverty line whilst their national resources are looted by gunmen-turned-millionaires.""
Salame also cautioned against opportunistic politicians in the country's two rival administrations - the Tripoli-based GNA and the House of Representatives in the eastern city of Tobruk - who seek to prolong the country's chaotic status quo for their own personal gain.
The violence also cast doubt at the prospect of holding nationwide presidential and parliamentary elections by December, agreed by rival Libyan leaders who met in May in Paris at the behest of French President Emmanuel Macron.
Italy has called for the launch of peace talks between rival groups, which it hopes can take place in November as a prelude to the planned December polls.
But Giuseppe Conte, Italy's prime minister, acknowledged last month that Rome was in no rush to see elections happen.
""Italy's primary interest is to stabilise Libya and to hold the presidential and political elections with appropriate guarantees,"" Conte told reporters last month.
Meanwhile, renegade General Khalifa Haftar, whose self-declared Libyan National Army controls much of eastern Libya, denounced Italy's approach as counterproductive.
Al Jazeera spoke to Jalel Harchaoui, a political analyst and scholar, to get a sense of where Libya stands and what it needs to do to bridge political differences and move the legislative process forward.
Al Jazeera: Do recent clashes in Tripoli present the international community with a new reality of the situation in Libya?
Jalel Harchaoui: I think it's more about the optics rather than a reality that would have been completely novel. A lot of what happened had been almost predicted by several political scientists.
What the international community was engaged in was a very strong and tenacious desire to believe that the equilibrium in Tripoli was tenable, viable and stable - that wasn't the reality.
People detached from governments and the UN had enough information to conclude that, yes, there was an equilibrium in Tripoli but that it wasn't tenable.
Foreign states are now forced to see what they were not willing to see: the fact that downtown Tripoli, the centre of the capital where all the embassies are, as well as other vital institutions, cannot be separated from the rest of Libya.
What we have seen over the last 10 days was that armed groups outside Tripoli, in the periphery, were not going to stand by idly while those in the capital take advantage of the opportunities for embezzlement.
Al Jazeera: Can militia violence and their disproportionate influence over civilian authorities be reined in?
Harchaoui: No one - neither the Libyans in the Tripolitania region nor the foreign states nor the UN - has undertaken any real effort to build a state. On the contrary, what we have seen is a temptation, or even an interest, in working with militias.
These militias were smart enough to know that in order to receive support and please some of the actors, they were expected to conduct a political war against groups like the Islamist figures and groups whom they expelled from the capital city.
It is difficult to see how these convenient groups can be dismantled. They are useful to some outside parties with foreign agenda.
At the same time, one must keep in mind that accepting a militia is not a good start to state-building efforts. A militia will continue torturing people, being opaque and corrupt, regardless of what it says.
In sum, we don't know whether they can be reined in until we actually try. If you don't question a militia, you cannot diffuse its power and incorporate it into state structures effectively.
Foreign states are not the only culprits but it is important to highlight their role. The United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia and France, in particular, were all too happy to court the militias.
These three countries happily accepted the militias as legitimate actors to work with. They were deeply interested in co-opting them because they thought these militias did not belong to the Muslim Brotherhood.
The militias in Tripoli did improve the security situation but they were also expected to wage a different kind of war, a political battle against Islamists and revolutionary militias in the capital.
The reason why I single out those three is because nobody seems to mention them. They were not denounced by the UN, civil society groups or NGOs.
Al Jazeera: Do the latest developments give reason to Italy's approach, as opposed to France's, to the Libyan crisis which has emphasised national reconciliation before nationwide polls can be held?
Harchaoui: In terms of Italy and France, no single approach is best.
Italy has a lot to do with the collapse that just happened and engaged in a strategy that it thought would be very productive but which in the end proved futile.
Rome tried to cultivate the status quo by talking to as many actors as possible, both inside and outside Tripoli.
They adopted a horizontal approach and they genuinely thought that they'd be able to control the whole thing and stitch everything [militias] together into a functioning state.
France doesn't know Libya nearly as well as Italy. They have no contacts in the cities of Sabratha or Misrata. They were not even able to invite Misratans to the May 29 summit in Paris.
But the French government's approach is quite similar to Italy's in Tripoli, where both celebrated the capital's newfound stability and the four big militias that upheld it.
The difference has to do with the periphery but the Italians - by virtue of historical circumstances - have a much wider reach.
The French looked at the developments in eastern Libya, where Haftar restored a semblance of normality, and at how central Tripoli also seemed to have been stabilised and thought why not organise elections overlooking the simmering tensions in the capital's outskirts.
Stability for Italy, on the other hand, is far more important.
It imports some 300,000 barrels of oil per day from Libya and the impact of instability, especially in terms of refugee flows, would be unbearable.
They didn't want anybody to rock the boat, as it were, and elections were a risky endeavour.
Al Jazeera: What can the international community do to move the legislative process forward?
Harchaoui: France doesn't just want elections. It is interested in creating the role of a president, knowing fully well that Libya has a parliamentary system at the moment. France is therefore extraordinarily ambitious and it's asking for a lot.
This stands in contrast with the Italian, British and the United States' approach, which is a lot more prudent and pragmatic: there is talk of parliamentary elections but not before June 2019.
To move the legislative process forward, one step that the UN can take, and the international community more broadly, is to break the taboo about the Emiratis and Saudis bypassing international efforts and interfering by supporting the militias that most suit their agenda.
The international community should be able to ask these two states to back off.
Many people talk about the run-ins and war of words between France and Italy but this isn't that major of an issue.
It’s good to criticise Qatar and Turkey but the other two are never mentioned simply because they happen to be anti-Muslim Brotherhood which in my view is problematic.
Of course, there are other issues in Libya that have nothing to do with Islamism. They have to do with state construction and can be addressed once foreign meddling stops.

The two separatist groups seek Kurdish autonomy in Iran and operate in exile in neighbouring Iraq.
Kurds account for about 10 percent of Iran's population of 80 million people, with many living in the mountainous northwest region that borders Iraq and Turkey.
A breakaway Kurdish republic backed by the Soviets briefly emerged after World War II and a Kurdish uprising followed in the years after Iran's 1979 Islamic Revolution.
An armed campaign by PDKI fighters in Iran continued into the mid-1990s. Ultimately, the PDKI declared a unilateral ceasefire with Iran in 1996.
News channel Kurdistan 24 said the attack occurred at a meeting of the PDKI leaders, adding that at least two senior officials - secretary-general Mustafa Mawludi and his predecessor Khalid Azizi - were wounded in the shelling.
Saturday's attack was the deadliest on the party's headquarters since 1996, the channel said. It came a day after the PDKI accused Iran of conducting ""indiscriminate shelling"" at the border region between Iraq and Iran.
The PDKI also staged attacks across the border in Iran on Friday, ending a 20-year ceasefire with the Islamic Republic, according to dpa news agency.
A PDKI leader, Mohammed Saleh Qadri, told dpa that Iranian drones took off from the oil-rich city of Kirkuk and hit the party's bases in Koya.
Koya, also known as Koysinjaq, is about 60km east of the autonomous Kurdish region's capital Erbil. Citing local officials, Rudaw, a Kurdish television channel, said the Koya region ""has been under bombardment for days"".
Meanwhile, Iran on Saturday executed three alleged Kurdish separatists, according to Iran's Fars news agency.
One of them, Ramin Hossein Panahi, had planned to bomb a rally in Iran's Kurdish province last June, Fars said. Zaniar Moradi and Loghman Moradi were executed for being members of an unnamed ""terrorist separatist group"" and of killing people, the report added.
On Friday, Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps admitted to killing six members of a Kurdish armed group involved in a July attack on an Iranian border post.

At Friday's summit, Hassan Rouhani, Vladimir Putin and Recep Tayyip Erdogan were expected to sign an agreement about ongoing military cooperation in Syria, the right of return for refugees displaced by the conflict, and the creation of a committee to investigate the fates of people arrested by the government or who went missing during the conflict, according to Iran's foreign ministry.
In its eighth year, Syria's civil war has seen more than half a million Syrians dead and 11 million - more than half the country's population - either internally displaced or living as refugees in Lebanon, Jordan, Turkey and Europe.
While Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has the military advantage, he now presides over a country where large areas more closely resemble fields of rubble than cities or towns.
On Monday, just days before the trilateral summit in Tehran, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif made a surprise visit to Damascus where he looked ahead to reconstruction.
""Reconstruction of Syria and Iraq is a good opportunity for the presence of Iranian companies,"" said Zarif.
""God willing, we will have talks with the three members of the Astana process on Friday to prevent any harm to the Syrian people and pave the way for the process of purging extremists.""
But even though world leaders are talking about returning refugees and reconstruction, Syrian lives are still at risk.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi appealed to Iranian leaders to prevent more bloodshed in the Syrian conflict.
""It is clear that the risks of a military confrontation causing massive loss of life is very high and I told Zarif that my appeal, just like the UN Secretary-General and others, is for them to minimise the loss of life,"" Grandi told Al Jazeera.
""I also pointed out that the government of Syria wants people to go back. Other governments, like Russia, want people to go back. The refugees are watching how the war will continue.""
Grandi added that world leaders were not doing enough to stop the conflicts that result in large refugee crises and that the circumstances for civilians displaced by war were getting worse every year.
While he commended Iran's long-continuing help for Afghan refugees, he said leaders in Tehran are also in a position to speak for the rights of Syrian refugees. ""Iran already shoulders a very heavy responsibility with Afghan and some Iraqi refugees on its own territory and I think it would be unfair to ask Iran to do more,"" said Grandi.
""But certainly, we’re asking Iran to add its voice to those that request more support for Syrian refugees, for Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh to ask for more support and to ask for solutions to those conflicts that determine the flight of these populations.""

Rojia Begum and Sadia Begum are two of the 130 community healthcare workers who've been recruited by the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) from among the Rohingya residing in Bangladesh.
When they find Rujina, who is about to give birth to her third child, they explain how they'll assist with her delivery and outline all the medical options available.
""We didn’t get to see any doctors in Myanmar,"" Rujina told Al Jazeera, adding that she had no idea care like this was possible.
""The doctors there are Buddhists. They wouldn’t treat us because we are Muslims.""
In another part of the camp, these newborns and their mothers are being looked after in a facility run by UNFPA, a novel experience for a population of refugees with largely conservative attitudes towards reproductive health.
One of the biggest challenges for aid workers has been trying to convince Rohingya women here to go to clinics voluntarily.
Because of the unrelenting persecution they faced in Myanmar, many of them are distrustful and fearful of medical facilities.
Since August 2017, Sadia Begum has come to the aid of numerous Rohingya women subjected to extreme physical, psychological and sexual violence by the Myanmar military. As plainly and painfully as she can, she explains why the women she helps are so fearful.
""These women are always scared that the doctors will kill their babies,"" said Sadia.
Despite the obstacles, aid workers say providing services that aim to ensure not just safer pregnancies and childbirth, but also options for family planning, are already having an impact.
""We've seen a real increase in the number of women who elect to have the longer-acting contraceptives,"" says UNFPA's Carly Learson.
""We're also seeing a big increase in the number of men who are being supportive of their wives doing that. A lot of women have decided that they've had enough children and they want to get on with their lives, learn a new skill, and don't want to have any more children.""
Down another alleyway in the camp, Raja and Sadia continue their work and locate a refugee woman pregnant with her first child.
Dispensing wisdom to the anxious mother-to-be, they do what they can to provide a kind of comfort this woman has never known.

In the first six months of the year, border police either turned away or arrested more than 3,000 migrants and refugees, according to data released on Thursday by local rights monitor group the Hungarian Helsinki Committee (HHC).
That figure is down from more than 40,000 in the 18 months prior as a result of ""push-backs"", a process that allows border police to physically remove asylum seekers within 8km of the border without due process.
Hungary has in recent years become a less viable option for asylum seekers fleeing war-torn Middle Eastern countries, following a slew of laws making it nearly impossible for migrants and refugees to resettle there.
According to the HHC, Hungary accepted just 430 asylum applications from January to July, down from 3,397 for all of 2017, while granting asylum to only 310 migrants compared with 1,216 during the same period.
In addition to stricter border laws and a 175-km wire fence along the Hungarian-Serbian border, Hungary this year also passed the ""Stop Soros"" bill, which allows for the imprisonment of anybody aiding undocumented migrants.
""As a result, a lot of people have decided to give up,"" Andras Lederer, information and advocacy officer for the Hungarian Helsinki Committee's refugee programme, told Al Jazeera.
""They literally grab someone, put them in a police car, drive them to the border and push them out,"" he said.
""You can't appeal against it. The whole thing takes 15 to 20 minutes and there is nothing the people can do about it.""
Orban's hardline stance and subsequent crackdown on migrants and refugees have been heavily criticised by numerous rights groups and international organisations, including the UNHCR and the Council of Europe's Human Rights Commissioner as a violation of fundamental human rights.
The so-called ""push-back"" laws passed in July 2016 allow police to engage apprehended asylum seekers. Rights groups have cited hundreds of claims that such removals are often violent and can occur nowhere near the borders.
""The key thing here is that no matter what legislation they pass, the government is trying to deter people from coming into Hungary, whether it's through the practice of violently pushing people back across the borders, or making life miserable for those who do get into the transit zones,"" said Lydia Gall, Eastern EU and Balkans researcher at Human Rights Watch (HRW).
Last month, HRW reported Hungarian authorities had stopped food distribution for rejected asylum seekers held in transit zones on the country's border with Serbia, something that its Immigration and Asylum Office later argued it was under no obligation to provide.
""Hungary is not responsible for those who have not requested asylum and those whose requests have been denied. There's no free lunch for illegal immigrants,"" government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs wrote in a post.

The influx has provoked debate over how the country handles refugees, including an online backlash, a petition for the government to take action and protests on Jeju and the capital Seoul.
This also prompted the government to remove Yemen from the list of countries whose citizens are allowed visa-free entry to Jeju and to tweak its refugee policy.
A strong anti-refugee sentiment has been seen in South Korea, driven largely by Islamophobia, that analysts say is caused mostly by ignorance among the population and the prevalence of fake news stories.
Al Jazeera spoke to Heinn Shin, Korea spokesperson for the UN's refugee agency (UNHCR), about the causes of xenophobia, the government's role in calming fears and rooting out fake news and why the agency is not at the forefront of helping these refugees.
Al Jazeera: What role is UNHCR Korea playing in this current refugee crisis? Why is it not actively involved in assisting and helping these refugees on Jeju island?
Heinn Shin: Different UNHCR offices have different roles. For a place like Korea, which is an advanced country with its own refugee system, we play a supporting role. We don't directly help out in supporting refugees. We can't do anything that the government didn't ask us to. If we don't like something, we can release a statement but we can't go out and action anything.
Al Jazeera: So does the Korean government have that ability?
Shin: Of course. It has its own refugee system.
Al Jazeera: But why are there so many protests, discrimination and harassment of the refugees? Is the government playing an active role?
Shin: Comparatively speaking, Korea has a very young refugee history. It's traditionally a very homogenous country so it's not just about refugees or migrants. It's about outsiders, non-Koreans in general. Korea is in a developing stage and UNHCR is supporting the government to play that role better.
Al Jazeera: Are you happy with the role the government is playing? It seems to have listened to the protesters?
Shin: We have to give credit to the Korean government. It already knew the public wouldn't be open to the idea of receiving more refugees, but despite that, it went ahead and enacted a stand-alone refugee act.
Al Jazeera: What do you mean the government knew the public wouldn't be open to refugees? Isn't that an obvious case of xenophobia?
Shin: Korea is geographically at a long distance from refugee hotspots. Decades ago, we had a system to bring in migrant labour from different Asian countries and there was huge public backlash. As a Korean, I can say that Koreans are not open to the idea of opening up.
Al Jazeera: Is that a cultural thing? Or a lack of knowledge?
Shin: It's a mixture of everything. But one unique thing about the Yemeni refugee situation is that it's the first time Koreans got to think about Islam. In a way that's a good thing. This will serve as a great chance for the public to understand Islam better.
It's also very important that UNHCR plays a balanced role. There are certain things that the government can do better but it also has to reflect what the public wants. And for us to criticise what the government does could cause backlash, not against the government, but against the refugees. We provide support where necessary.
Al Jazeera: So the government's decision to take Yemen, and other countries where refugees might come from, off the visa-free list, is reflecting public opinion then?
Shin: Yes, definitely. The Jeju government did that. There were concerns among the public, albeit based on wrong information. There were concerns not just about employment but also about security. There were lots of females talking about it so I do think the government had to take that into account.
Al Jazeera: These Yemenis were also branded fake refugees. What is a fake refugee?
Shin: There's a refugee and not a refugee. There are no fake refugees. That's our message. This phrase stems from the fact that these Yemenis are male, young, flew to Jeju and carry iPhones. So it's ignorance on the Koreans' part. They don't understand these people are fleeing persecution. You can be rich or poor but when a war breaks out, that doesn't matter. There's xenophobia, not against refugees but against Muslims. They also don't understand Islamic culture. And the fake news about extremism fuels these fears.
I don't think any Korean who has ever met a refugee or a Muslim would be against them. UNHCR's role should be trying to explain to the general public who these refugees are. And I'm afraid, UNHCR has failed in that role for many years.
And we've only just realised that. Because we had no idea, despite the country having 150,000 Muslims, that the public would be so cautious and concerned. And telling the government to choose between their rights or the refugees' rights.
Al Jazeera: Since UNHCR has not been playing an active role, what does it need to do more of?
Shin: We need to support the government. We also need to continue persuading the public. As the refugee and asylum seekers' population grows in Korea, it can't be the government's role to do everything. We and the civil society would need to help out.
It's our message to the public as well as that if you're happy to help out that Syrian kid in the TV ad through donations, would you receive him if he was to come to Korea? It's that message we're trying to deliver. In a country like Korea, it's strange to see someone who doesn't look like you and speak the same language. It'll take us time to solve this but I'm sure it can be solved.

The report released on Monday reveals that while the number of crossings has fallen, the deaths have risen, making the voyage more deadly in percentage terms for those who venture across.
According to the report, people smugglers are taking greater risks in the journey due to increased surveillance.
A total of 2,276 people died last year while trying to cross, this represented one death for every 42 arrivals.
This year, it is 1,095 deaths, or one out of every 18 arrivals. In June alone, the proportion hit one death for every seven arrivals. About 500 people have gone missing.
""This report once again confirms the Mediterranean as one of the world's deadliest sea crossings,"" said UNHCR's director of the Bureau for Europe, Pascale Moreau.
""With the number of people arriving on European shores falling, this is no longer a test of whether Europe can manage the numbers, but whether Europe can muster the humanity to save lives,"" she added.
People travelling to Europe continue to do so for different reasons.
Some continue to flee armed conflict and human rights violations, while others seek international protection on account of religious, ethnic or political persecution or to escape different forms of sexual or gender-based violence, the report revealed.
On the Central Mediterranean route so far this year, there have been 10 separate incidents in which 50 or more people died - most after departing from Libya.
""The reason the traffic has become more deadly is that the traffickers are taking more risk, because there is more surveillance exercised by the Libyan coast guards,"" said Vincent Cochetel, UNHCR's special envoy for the central Mediterranean.
Seven of those incidents have been since June alone, UNHCR said.
""This is not new, we have highlighted this for a while now,"" Maria Jesus Vega a spokesperson from UNCHR in Spain told Al Jazeera.
""We need a regional response, this not an exclusive problem from those countries that are in the outer border, such as Italy, Greece or Spain.""
And while people risk their lives in the journey, this is not the only time they are at risk.
""People aiming to reach to Europe risk their lives multiple times,"" Vega said.
""They risk their lives when they try to flee conflict in their countries, when they need to cross the borders with no authorisation, and when they fall in the hands of traffickers and mafias that promise to take them,"" she explained.
Libyan authorities intercepted or rescued 18,400 people between August last year and July this year - a 38-percent increase from the same period of 2016 and 2017.
Arrivals by sea from Libya to Europe plummeted 82 percent in those comparable periods, to 30,800 in the more recent one.
UNHCR says a growing worry these days is deaths on land by people trying to get to Libya in the first place, or getting stuck in squalid, overcrowded detention centres.
Many are returned there after failing to cross by sea to Europe.
The problems after disembarkation (is that) those people are sent back to detention centres and many disappear,"" Cochetel said.
""Many are sold to militias, and to traffickers, and people employing them without paying them.""
He said the drop in departures means that traffickers attempt to ""monetise their investment, which means they have to exploit more people.""
""That results in more cases of slavery, forced labour, prostitution of those people - because they (smugglers) want to make money off those people.""
And while this route is deadly, this is not the only one that raises a red alert.
""The route of Morocco or Algeria to Spain has also shown an increase in the death rate,"" Vega said.
""So far this year more than 300 people have died.""
""Last year, we had a total of 200 deaths, this is very worrisome, and a lot of this has to do with the mafias that are operating the route, they are taking greater risks every day,"" she added.
Spain is the third-busiest point of arrival for all refugees and migrants entering Europe by sea, behind Italy and Greece, accounting for 23 percent of all such arrivals to the EU.

He had been chosen as a part of an initiative to provide education to migrants and asylum seekers in Europe.
A blogger and published author who fled from Bangladesh, Azad had hoped to use develop his expertise on the right to freedom of speech when the academic year begins on Monday.
But last week, CEU was forced to suspend the programme after a new law went into effect imposing a hefty ""immigration surtax"", equal to 25 percent of the entire budget of institutions that in any capacity directly or indirectly promotes immigration.
For Azad and dozens of other students who had benefited from the programme, it is a devastating blow in a region with few options for refugees and migrants wishing to pursue higher education.
""This is very difficult for me. I don't know this language and now I am having to do this totally alone,"" he said. ""I think this world is for humans and we should respect all of them.""
Wafa, 52, a doctor from Yemen currently residing in Budapest, joined the programme for a year in 2016.
She said that she had planned to rejoin the school, but is now unsure where to go to continue her work.
""Many of us will complain about this. Many refugees depend on this university to study or get work,"" she said.
The government says that a pro-migrant stance is not in the best interests of Hungarians.
""The issue of migration is an issue of European democracy; there is a gap between the utopian, pro-immigration concept of left-wing elites and the interests of the people,"" government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs said in a statement on Tuesday.
Hungarian-born American billionaire George Soros, who funds the programme, has been a persistent target of the nationalist government led by populist Prime Minister Viktor Orban.
""The programmes have provided educational training only for persons legally admitted to Hungary. We are proud of this work and of our research on refugee and migration issues in Europe and will seek all possible ways to continue this work in the future,"" CEU says on ts website.
In June, parliament overwhelmingly passed a package of legislation known as the ""Stop Soros"" bill that would allow for the imprisonment of anybody aiding migrants, despite pleas from international bodies including the European Union and United Nations not to do so.
The latest bill which has drawn similar criticism from rights organisations, is the most recent attack on migrants and civil society actors attempting to help asylum seekers fleeing from war-torn countries.
It comes as pressure mounts on the European Union to impose sanctions on the straying member state.
""Unless EU institutions make it clear to the Hungarian government that taxing and criminalising work with asylum seekers, migrants, and refugees is unacceptable and an affront to EU laws and values, we may see more valuable programmes and projects fold,"" Lydia Gall, an Eastern Europe researcher at Human Rights Watch, wrote on Wednesday.
The bill has also been criticised for being intentionally vague, forcing CEU to close its migrant programme while it seeks tax advice, the university wrote in a statement on August 28.
""This is a law that has to be seen in two contexts; one as a part of a series of punitive measures against asylum seekers and refugees in Hungary, and secondly as a part of the famous illiberal turn, so [my] feeling is one of frustration,"" said Prem Kumar Rajaram, a volunteer and administrator of the programme.
Petra Bard, an expert on EU constitutional law and EU criminal justice and visiting professor of the Central European University (CEU), said that while the government has continued to repress the rights of migrants, Prime Minister Orban is clamping down on education in general to stamp out any curriculum that could be seen as a breeding ground for liberal thought.
Last month, the government moved to ban gender studies at universities on the basis that it served to no benefit among employers looking to hire students.
""One way to control people is to not grant them access to education,"" Bard said.

The US and British ambassadors who were present at the sentencing of Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo on Monday called the verdict a blow for Myanmar's transition to democracy.
Scot Marciel, US ambassador to Myanmar, said he was ""sad for Wa lone and Kyaw Soe Oo and their families, but also for Myanmar"".
""It's deeply troubling ... one has to ask will this process increase or decrease the confidence the people of Myanmar have in their justice system,"" he said.
Dan Chugg, British ambassador to Myanmar expressed extreme disappointment and lambasted presiding Judge Ye Lwin over the verdict.
""The judge has appeared to have ignored evidence and to have ignored Myanmar law. This has dealt a hammer blow for the rule of law,"" he said.
Iqbal Sobhan Chowdhury, media adviser to Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, also strongly condemned the verdict.
""It is now an open secret that any media or any person who wants to reveal the atrocities of the Myanmar army and administration against the Rohingya people will face persecution by the Myanmar government,"" he said.
Bangladesh hosts more than 700,000 Rohingya who fled Myanmar following a security crackdown by its army in Rakhine State last year.
Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo had pleaded not guilty to violating the colonial-era Official Secrets Act, punishable by up to 14 years in prison. They contended they were framed by police.
The Reuters reporters were arrested on December 12 while investigating the killing of 10 Rohingya and other abuses involving soldiers and police in Inn Din, a village in Rakhine State.
Myanmar has denied allegations of atrocities made by thousands of refugees against its security forces, saying it conducted a legitimate military operation against Rohingya fighters.
But the military has acknowledged the killing of the 10 Rohingya men and boys at Inn Din after arresting the Reuters reporters.
Wa Lone, calling Monday's decision ""unfair"" and ""one-sided"", said it ""directly threatens"" Myanmar's democracy and freedom of the press.
Speaking to reporters on the court steps after the sentencing, Wa Lone gave a defiant ""thumbs up"" and said: ""We will face it [the verdict] with stability and courage"".
Kyaw Soe Oo also said the reporters had committed no crime and that they would maintain their fight for press freedom.
""What I want to say to the government is: you can put us in jail, but do not close the eyes and ears of the people,"" he said.
The case has drawn worldwide attention as an example of how press freedom is suffering under the government of Myanmar's de facto leader and Nobel Peace laureate Aung San Suu Kyi.
Kristian Schmidt, EU ambassador to Myanmar, in a post on Twitter, said the prison sentences of Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo should be ""reviewed and they should be released immediately and unconditionally"".
EU: The prison sentences of Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo should be reviewed and they should be released immediately and unconditionally.
Expressing his disappointment, Knut Ostby, UN resident and humanitarian aid coordinator in Myanmar, also called for the release of the journalists.
""The United Nations has consistently called for the release of the Reuters journalists and urged the authorities to respect their right to pursue freedom of expression and information,"" he said.
""Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo should be allowed to return to their families and continue their work as journalists.""
Denmark, in a statement, urged Myanmar's government to undo ""this injustice"", while a spokesman at the Dutch embassy in Myanmar called on President Win Myint to release the two journalists as soon as possible.
Stephen J Adler, Reuters' editor-in-chief, called the ruling a ""major step backward in Myanmar's transition to democracy"" and said it ""must be corrected by the Myanmar government as a matter of urgency"".
He denounced the charges against the reporters as ""false"" and ""designed to silence their reporting and intimidate the press"".
""We will not wait while Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo suffer this injustice and will evaluate how to proceed in the coming days, including whether to seek relief in an international forum,"" he added.
Phil Robertson, deputy Asia director for the Human Rights Watch, called the sentence an ""outrageous injustice"" and said Myanmar's military, also known as the Tatmadaw, wanted a guilty verdict against the two reporters in order to ""intimidate"" other journalists to avoid reporting on human rights violations.
""This is clearly a situation when the Tatmadaw has won the day,"" he told Al Jazeera.
""This is a court system that has been very close to the Burmese military, [and] has done its dirty work in the past. We do not really see the kind the of independent judiciary that we would expect in a modern democracy.""
No words for this outrageous injustice against @Reuters reporters Wa Lone & Kyaw Soe Oo. How can #Myanmar judicial system justify sending reporters doing their job to a longer prison sentence than the #Tatmadaw soldiers who killed the 10 #Rohingya in their story in cold blood? pic.twitter.com/lI2Qp0k6ub
The Committee to Protect Journalists also condemned the sentencing of Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo, saying it marked a ""new low for Myanmar"".
""The process that resulted in their convictions was a travesty of justice and will cast Myanmar as an anti-democratic pariah as long as they are wrongfully held behind bars,"" said Shawn Crispin, CPJ's senior Southeast Asia representative in a statement.
Amnesty International's Tirana Hassan called the verdict ""a politically motivated decision"" with significant ramifications for press freedom in Myanmar.
""It sends a stark warning to other journalists of the severe consequences that await should they look too closely at military abuses. This amounts to censorship through fear,"" she said.
Thant Myint-U, Myanmar historian and commentator, said the verdict marked a ""tragic day for media freedom and an intimation of what's to come"".
In the Kutupalong refugee camp in Bangladesh, Mohib Ullah, a Rohingya leader, said he hoped the two journalists are freed soon.
""This is not justice. I would like to see them free as soon as possible. They did nothing wrong,"" he said.

https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/09/donors-increase-palestine-refugee-agency-funding-cuts-180902085540064.html,refugee,801,Sun Sep 02 2018 10:22:38 GMT+0000,None,Donors to increase UNRWA support and funding despite US cuts,"United States' decision to cut funding for the UN Palestine refugee agency (UNRWA) is ""an evident politicization of humanitarian aid"", according to the organisation's commissioner-general.
UNRWA, which says it provides services to more than five million Palestinian refugees in the occupied territories as well as Jordan, Syria and Lebanon, currently faces a budget deficit of $270m for the remainder of the year after the US government slashed its budget by $300m.
In an open letter to the agency's staff, Pierre Krahenbuhl dismissed claims made by US State Department that it was an ""irredeemably flawed operation"" and prolonged the status of refugees.
""The responsibility for the protracted nature of the Palestine refugee-hood, the growing number of refugees and the growth in needs, lies squarely with the parties and in the international community's lack of will or utter inability to bring about a negotiated and peaceful resolution of the conflict between Israel and Palestine,"" wrote Krahenbuhl in the letter.
""The attempt to make UNRWA somehow responsible for perpetuating the crisis is disingenuous at best. At no time over the past eight months were we notified of the specific reasons for the dramatic cut.""
Krahenbuhl went on to say that the decision taken by the US, which has been its most generous and consistent donor since 1974, will not have any bearing on UNRWA's responsibility towards Palestine refugees or affect the ""energy and passion"" it carries out.
UNRWA was formed in 1949 following the forced displacement of 700,000 Palestinians by Zionist paramilitaries in the run-up to the establishment of Israel.
Over the past year, more than 50 countries have contributed to the agency.
In recent years, the European Union has been the second-largest contributor. It pledged more than $142m in 2017.
In a statement published on Saturday, the EU termed the US decision ""regrettable"", one that will leave a ""substantial gap"" in the agency's funding.
""The EU is committed to secure the continuation and sustainability of the agency's work which is vital for stability and security in the region,"" the statement said.
""The EU and its member states, and many others in the international community, including many Arab states, have pledged their support to the continuity of the work that UNRWA is doing.""
In the run-up to the UN General Assembly session later this month, EU foreign ministers, along with their international and regional partners, will discuss how to guarantee sustainable and effective aid to Palestinians, the statement added.
Following the US announcement, Germany announced it will increase funding for the UNRWA, its foreign minister said.
""The loss of this organisation could unleash an uncontrollable chain reaction,"" Heiko Maas said on Saturday before adding that while Germany contributed $94m to UNRWA this year, it was prepared to increase its financial aid.
Maas also urged the EU and member states to work towards ""a sustainable finance basis for the organization"".
His statement was echoed by Ireland's Deputy Prime Minister Simon Coveney, who called the US decision ""heartless and dangerous"".
""Ireland is a long-standing supporter of UNRWA,"" said Coveney. ""We will continue that assistance and discuss with our EU and other partners what more can be done to support its work.""
On the same day, Jordan's Foreign Minister Ayman al-Safadi said his country will rally donor support to ease UNRWA's financial crisis.
""Disruption of UNRWA services will have extremely dangerous humanitarian, political and security implications for refugees and for the whole region,"" Safadi told the Reuters news agency.
Jordan hosts more than two million registered Palestinian refugees. Safadi warned that shutting down UNRWA would create ""fertile grounds for further tensions"".
Meanwhile, Israeli media reported on Sunday that funding by the Arab Gulf states to the refugee agency would be condition-based on a revised definition and number of Palestinian refugees.
According to Israeli Channel 2, the US will allow the Gulf states to fund UNRWA this year to ensure continuation of the organisation's immediate activities.
Funding for next year, however, will be subject to agreeing with the US demand to count only 500,000 refugees out of the five million, the report said.
In March, Qatar announced to pledge $50m, its largest sum to UNRWA to date, saying that the importance of the agency's sustainable funding, which provides food provisions, schooling, healthcare, and relief and social services, was crucial to the improvement of the lives of Palestinian refugees.
Hanan Ashrawi, an executive committee member of the Palestinian Liberation Organisation, denounced the US decision to end all funding to the agency as ""a cruel and irresponsible move targeting the most vulnerable segment of Palestinian society"".
""With such a decision, the US is doing Israel's bidding and destroying the very foundations of peace and stability by taking all permanent status issues 'off the table', including the right of return for refugees and occupied Jerusalem,"" she said.

Chris Gunness, spokesperson for the United Nations Relief Works and Agency, said on Saturday Friday's move would affect ""millions of people"" including ""some of the most disadvantaged and marginalised on this planet"".
For nearly 70 years, UNRWA has provided lifesaving assistance to more than five million Palestinian refugees in the occupied territories, as well as Lebanon, Syria and Jordan.
But over the past year, the US government has made it increasingly clear it considers the work the organisation does, and who it considers as refugees, to be an obstacle in the protracted Palestinian-Israeli conflict.
In January, a month after President Donald Trump sparked widespread international condemnation by recognising Jerusalem as Israel's capital, the White House decided to cut $65m in aid to UNRWA.
It was later reported that the Trump administration had withheld about $305m in funding, and only delivered $60m to UNRWA.
UNRWA told Al Jazeera it spent the next eight months scrambling for financial assistance, and was only able to continue operating after large contributions were raised by Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, which donated $150m between them.
The US decision to stop all funding to the UN agency, which it called an ""irredeemably flawed operation"", was quickly criticised by the Palestinian leadership.
A spokesperson for UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres also pushed back against claims that the agency was inefficient.
""UNRWA has a strong record of providing high-quality education, health and other essential services, often in extremely difficult circumstances,"" a statement by Stephane Dujarric read.
""The secretary-general calls on other countries to help fill the remaining financial gap, so that UNRWA can continue to provide this vital assistance, as well as a sense of hope this vulnerable population.""
Originally established as a temporary solution, UNRWA was set up after the creation of Israel in 1948 to assist the more than 700,000 Palestinians who were forcibly expelled from their towns and villages.
Since then, it has helped four generations of Palestinians with basic needs, including housing, healthcare, education and social services.
Employing more than 30,000 staff, it mostly works in education, and operates closely with local government bodies.
It helps more than half of the Gaza Strip's two million population, a region which has been devastated by more than 10 years of blockade.
According to UNRWA, Gaza suffers from a 44 percent unemployment rate.
Gunness, the agency's spokesman, told Al Jazeera that if UNRWA didn't receive emergency cash injection in the next 30 days, when its funds are expected to run dry, a ""doomsday scenario"" could unfold.
""Let there be no mistake; this decision is likely to have a devastating impact on the lives of 526,000 children who receive a daily education from UNRWA; 3.5 million sick people who come to our clinics for medical care; 1.7 million food insecure people who receive assistance from us, and tens of thousands of vulnerable women, children and disabled refugees who come to us.
""If we don't fill a funding gap of $217m very quickly, they are all likely to suffer.""
Mohammad Oweis, Palestinian refugee
According to UNRWA, the US provided $364m to the agency last year. Other member states donated $650m.
The funds helped provide for basic commodities such as flour, rice, sugar, powdered milk, canned meats, pharmaceuticals and drugs, as well as general supplies such as school textbooks and equipment.
Mohammad Oweis, a Washington, DC-based political analyst and researcher, who specialises in the Middle East, said the agency helped people such as himself go on to live a better life.
""I was born in a tent in a refugee camp. I was raised in camp. Without the help of UNRWA, I would not have had clothes, food or schooling,"" he said.
Key to the Trump administration and Israel's criticism of UNRWA is the way the agency counts the refugees - its total includes the descendants of refugees who were originally displaced by the creation of Israel.
Israel fears that the passing of refugee status from parents to children could threaten the country's so-called ""Jewish character"", as Palestinians claim the right of return to their ancestral homeland.
Earlier this year, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called for UNRWA to be scrapped and accused the agency of helping ""fictitious refugees"".
""UNRWA is an organisation that perpetuates the Palestinian refugee problem and the narrative of the right-of-return, as it were, in order to eliminate the State of Israel,"" Netanyahu said.
His comments were echoed earlier this week by Nikki Haley, the US ambassador to the UN, who accused the agency of exaggerating the number of Palestinian refugees it currently provides aid to, amid reports Washington is planning to cap the number it officially recognises as refugees at only 500,000.
""We will be a donor if it (UNRWA) reforms what it does ... if they actually change the number of refugees to an accurate account, we will look back at partnering them,"" Haley said.
By undermining UNRWA's definition of refugees, the administration appears to be attacking the Palestinian belief in the ""right of return"".
Mustafa Barghouti, a former Palestinian information minister and secretary-general of the Palestinian National Initiative, said the decision to end funding was ""not just an economic act, but also a political one"".
""The US tried to liquidate the issue of Jerusalem by saying they were removing it from the negotiating table, now they want to kill UNRWA with the aim of killing the right of the Palestinian refugees to return to their homeland.
""These are actions aimed at liquidating the Palestinian issue completely while trying to normalise relations between Israel and Arab countries.
""This will fail and what the Americans have done will make us more determined to stick to the rights of Palestinian refugees, especially after their nationalistic law, which is nothing but a system of apartheid"".
Sam Bahour, a cofounder of the Right to Enter campaign, which highlights Israeli restrictions on Palestinian movement, agreed, adding that the end of funding would awaken the Palestinian community.
""They are trying to force down Palestinians throats this idea that they will no longer return home, and this is something the Palestinians have historically refused to accept.""
In emails leaked to Foreign Policy magazine last month, Trump's son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner described the agency as not conducive to ""peace"".
And during his visit to Jordan last June, he reportedly pushed for the refugee status of the two million Palestinians registered in the country to be dissolved.
Saeb Erekat, secretary-general of the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO)
With the UN struggling to grapple with a host of international crises, the shortfall could have disastrous consequences for the five million Palestinian refugees.
According to Gunness, the $217m shortfall means that by the end of the month ""UNRWA will be running on empty and won't have enough money to pay for its 22,000 teaching staff"".
""After September we won't have enough money to run our schools, health clinics and our relief and social services programmes,"" he said. ""We are working tirelessly to avoid that.""
UNRWA's planned budget for 2018 was over $1bn. So far, Gulf states, Norway, Turkey and Canada have stepped in with pledges of $238m to help meet the budget deficit.
Gunness said it was ""remarkable"" the agency had managed to raise so much in the past eight months, adding it had a ""long way to go,"" as these pledges still needed to be paid out.
""We have been very generously supported by over 20 major donors and were looking for money from all of them and also from new donors,"" he said.
On Friday, Jordan's Foreign Minister, Ayman Safadi said Amman would host a fund-raising at the UN headquarters later in September with the aim to ""close the gap and put in place a plan that will ensure UNRWA's continued, ongoing funding for the coming years"".
Meanwhile, Heiko Maas, the German foreign minister, said Berlin had pledged to significantly increase its future contributions, from roughly $94 million this year to an unspecified larger amount.
The Reuters news agency quoted him as saying that ""the loss of [UNRWA] could unleash an uncontrollable chain reaction"".
Senior members of the Palestinian Authority denounced the US decision and said it violated international law.
Prime Minister Rami Hamdallah tweeted: ""We reject the US administration's decision to stop its funding of UNRWA in its latest blatant aggression against the rights of the Palestinian people, international law and UN General Assembly resolution 302 of 1949, which specified that the UN agency was established to provide its services in all areas until the refugee issue is resolved"".
Palestinian Authority Foreign Minister Ryad al-Maliki said: ""We will challenge the Trump decision & UNRWA is here to stay as long as there is one Palestinian refugee left.""
Saeb Erekat, the secretary-general of the Palestinian Liberation Organization, said the pro-Israel bias of Trump's administration has disqualified it from any role in the peace process.
""By cutting aid, the US is violating international law. UNRWA is not a Palestinian agency but was established by the United Nations, and there is an international obligation to assist and support it until all the problems of the Palestinian refugees are solved.""
Meanwhile, Sami Abu Zuhri, a senior official of Hamas, which administers the Gaza Strip, tweeted: ""The US decision to cancel aid to UNRWA aims to remove the right of return and represents a serious American escalation against the Palestinian people. The decision reflects the Zionist background of the American leadership that has become an enemy of our people and our Muslim nation as a whole.
""We insist that we will not succumb to such unjust decisions"".

The rallies drew about 8,000 people on Saturday, according to police, and ended peacefully.
Far-right protesters paraded with large portraits of victims of attacks perpetrated, they claimed, by asylum-seekers.
Some chanted ""Merkel must go"" and ""We are the people"" while waving German flags.
Rival demonstrators, meanwhile, brandished banners reading ""Chemnitz is neither grey nor brown"" and ""Heart instead of hate"".
A total of 1,800 police officers were deployed in the city to keep the groups apart.
Saturday's protests drew about 4,500 far-right supporters from various movements including the far-right anti-immigration Alternative for Germany (AfD) party and the anti-Islam PEGIDA movement, according to police estimates.
Another 3,500 marched in support of Merkel's immigration policy, which has seen more than one million migrants and refugees allowed into Germany since 2015.
The leftist groups accuse the AfD and PEGIDA of exploiting the stabbing of a 35-year-old German carpenter, allegedly by asylum seekers, last month - to stoke hatred against migrants and refugees.
There were outbreaks of street violence last week, after two men - one Iraqi and one Syrian - were arrested over the fatal stabbing.
Mobs launched random street attacks against people they took to be foreigners, including an Afghan, a Syrian and a Bulgarian man.
Chemnitz's mayor, Barbara Ludwig, took part in the left-wing protest.
The government lent its support to the pro-refugee rally through Foreign Minister Heiko Maas who tweeted: ""The Second World War started 79 years ago. Germany caused unimaginable suffering in Europe. If once again people are parading today in the streets making Nazi salutes, our past history forces us to resolutely defend democracy.""

The comments on Friday came shortly after the US government, a major ally of Israel, announced that it was stopping its funding to the United Nations Relief Works and Agency (UNRWA) after determining the organisation to be an ""irredeemably flawed operation"".
In a statement, the US State Department's spokesperson Heather Nauert said that UNRWA's ""endlessly and exponentially expanding community of entitled beneficiaries is simply unsustainable and has been in crisis mode for many years"".
""The administration has carefully reviewed the issue and determined that the United States will not make additional contributions to UNRWA,"" Nauert said.
The move came a week after the US announced that it was also cutting more than $200m in economic aid to Palestinians.
""The consecutive American decisions represent a flagrant assault against the Palestinian people and a defiance of UN resolutions,"" Palestinian Authority spokesperson Nabil Abu Rdainah told the Reuters news agency on Friday.
""Such a punishment will not succeed to change the fact that the United States no longer has a role in the region and that it is not a part of the solution.""
Al Jazeera's Rob Reynolds, reporting from Washington, DC, said the US decision was ""likely to considerably worsen an already dire situation in parts of the Palestinian territories, especially in Gaza"".
""They (the US) are justifying this largely on the grounds that the funding is mismanaged and that the agency itself wastes money and is inefficient,"" Reynolds said.
""This is part and parcel, together with the recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital, of an effort by the Trump administration to really affect some radical changes and try to re-set the table in the Middle East.""
UNRWA was established in 1949 after 700,000 Palestinians were forcibly displaced from their homes by Zionist paramilitaries in the run-up to the establishment of the state of Israel.
It currently provides services to five million Palestinian refugees in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, as well as Jordan, Lebanon and Syria.
Under the Donald Trump administration, the US government had previously slashed its budget to UNRWA operations in the occupied Palestinian territories from $365m to just $65m, resulting in work redundancies and a drop to part-time contracts for many of the agency's Palestinian employees and full-time staffers.
In late June, the UN had asked member states to fill a critical funding gap caused by the US government's funding cuts.
""The situation of Palestinians is defined by great anxiety and uncertainty, first because Palestinian refugees do not see a solution to their plight on the horizon,"" Pierre Krahenbuhl, UNRWA's director told a UN conference.
Earlier this week, UNRWA warned that if Washington went through with its funding cut it would likely result in greater instability in the region.
""You have to ask yourself the question: what would the Middle East look like if the most vulnerable people in that region were not to be receiving services from a UN humanitarian organisation,"" agency spokesman Chris Gunness told Anadolu Agency.
The US government is also pushing for a reduction in the number of Palestinian refugees, from five million to 500,000, and count only those who were directly displaced from their homes seven decades ago.
Consequently, millions of their descendants will be excluded.

""There's no place for us to go. If an offensive takes place, it will be a bloodbath,"" he told Al Jazeera on Saturday.
Qays, a volunteer with the civil defence group known as the White Helmets, is one of the almost three million people crammed in the northwestern province of Idlib, the last remaining rebel-held province in war-ravaged Syria.
For days now, President Bashar al-Assad's forces have been encircling Idlib, seemingly ready to launch what has been described as the last major battle in a long-running civil war that has killed hundreds of thousands of civilians, displaced millions and left the country in ruins.
If the assault takes place, Idlib will be ""the perfect storm"", UN Syria envoy Staffan de Mistura warned this week. A battle, he said, would affect millions of civilians and could see both sides use chemical weapons.
Similarly, Filippo Grandi, the head of the UN's refugee crisis, cautioned that an all-out attack would cause renewed displacement while exacerbating an already dire humanitarian situation.
After vowing to take back ""every inch"" of Syria, Assad, backed by his Russian and Iranian allies, has managed in recent years to roll back rebels from territories they had previously gained - from Aleppo, through Eastern Ghouta on the outskirts of Damascus, to Deraa, the birthplace of the 2011 uprising.
Like Qays - who was displaced with his family from Deraa after Assad's forces took over the city in July - hundreds of thousands of civilians and rebels from across Syria are now in Idlib, dubbed a ""dumping ground"" for those evacuated from other battlefields.
""We know there's nothing for us to do but wait,"" says Qays, recalling the grueling journey from the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights, where he stayed for two weeks, before joining scores of families onto buses that transported them to Idlib.
Today, more than half the of the families based in Idlib are from other parts of Syria, many of whom reside in overcrowded camps.
Qays, whose wife is expecting twins next month, says the prospect of a chemical attack is what scares him the most.
""We're expecting the government to target Idlib with a chemical attack, just like it did in Khan Sheikhoun. We've already been receiving threats,"" he says.
In April 2017, a chemical attack on Khan Sheikhoun, a town in Idlib, killed at least 83 people, a third of them children, and wounded nearly 300 others, according to a UN war crimes investigation.
The UN Commission of Inquiry (COI) on Syria said in September 2017 that it had gathered an ""extensive body of information"" to show the Syrian air force was responsible for the sarin gas attack.
But Russian officials have also warned that rebels might stage a chemical attack and then blamed it on Assad's forces in order to be used as a pretext for an assault by Western countries.
Speaking at a press conference on Thursday in Moscow alongside his Syrian counterpart Walid al-Muallem, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov warned against ""established provocateurs who call themselves the White Helmets"".
""This kind of provocation is being staged as to complicate the whole issue of combating the terrorists in Idlib,"" said Lavrov. ""We have warned our Western partners clearly that they should not engage in this kind of activity.
Although Idlib has been designated a ""de-escalation zone"" as part of an agreement struck by Russia, Iran and Turkey in Kazakhstan's capital, Astana, residents say the area has been targeted by Syrian and Russian air attacks in recent months.
According to Mohammed, a 24-year-old pro-opposition activist in Idlib, the fierce bombardment has forced local families to leave their villages.
""A small number of families have already been displaced from the southeastern suburbs of Idlib, moving towards areas along the Turkish border.""
Such movement is likely to intensify if a full-blown government offensive is launched.
""More families will be moving further north and closer to the Turkish border - that's the only direction we can potentially go,"" adds Mohamed.
Turkey, which is already hosting more than three million Syrian refugees, sealed off its border with Syria last year, allowing only for the passage of humanitarian goods.
Its troops rolled into Idlib last year to implement the ""de-escalation zone"" as per the Astana diplomatic process, as well as in Afrin and Al Bab following military operations against Kurdish fighters in Syria's north.
In recent weeks, Turkish-backed opposition groups in Idlib have attempted to form a new coalition, with some 70,000 fighters pledging to fight against forces loyal to Assad. But Hay'et Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), the most dominant rebel force in Idlib which controls about 60 percent of the province, has not joined the coalition.
Like many other Idlib residents, Dhafer, a 31-year-old pharmacist from Maarat al-Numan, said Turkish control over the area is the only way to guarantee the safety of its civilians.
""Our last strand of hope lies in Turkey,"" says Dhafer. ""It is the only regional power that has stood with us. We hope it will continue to do so in the coming days and weeks.""
Mevlut Cavusoglu, Turkey's foreign minister, told reporters on Friday that Ankara ""is trying to prevent an attack"" on Idlib, calling such a development ""a disaster"".
Turkey has been locked in intense negotiations with Russia over the past few weeks in hopes of preventing a large-scale assault that could prompt a new wave of displacement. On Friday, it officially designated HTS, which is dominated by a rebel faction previously known as al-Nusra Front before cutting its ties to al-Qaeda, a terrorist group.
""Thousands of us are calling on Turkey to take control of the region, just as it has done in Afrin and Jarablus,"" says Mohammed.
But with the outcome of the Turkish-Russian negotiations remaining unclear, various rebel groups inside Idlib are already starting to prepare for an escalation, according to sources.
""Opposition groups are digging up tunnels and massing along possible front lines in preparation for an offensive,"" says Anas, a pro-opposition activist and resident of Idlib.
""These tunnels are being dug up towards the southern and eastern suburbs of Idlib and will be used to push back a military offensive,"" he adds.
""They [the opposition] won't be the ones to start, but they will be ready to retaliate.""

The comments by Filippo Grandi, the UN high commissioner for refugees, on Friday came as protesters in Idlib rallied against the threat of military action by Syrian forces and its Russian ally to capture the strategic northwest province bordering Turkey.
Idlib is home to an estimated three million people, half of whom are internally displaced after being transferred en masse to the province from other areas that fell to pro-government forces.
Grandi, who is in Lebanon after visiting Syria and Jordan, said an all-out attack threatens to cause many civilian deaths and fresh displacement, as well as discourage the return of other refugees.
Speaking to reporters in Beirut, Grandi said an offensive was going to make the situation ""very difficult"" and appealed to the Syrian government to find a way forward that would ""spare civilian lives"".
""You risk also sending a message to refugees that the situation is not secured,"" Grandi said. ""Refugees will be watching very closely what is happening in Idlib in the next few months.""
Idlib is largely controlled by Hay'et Tahrir al-Sham, which is dominated by a rebel faction that was previously known as al-Nusra Front until it cut its ties to al-Qaeda.
Turkey has been trying to avoid a large-scale assault on Idlib, primarily by utilising pledges made via the Astana diplomatic track to maintain a lasting ceasefire.
On Friday, Turkey - which has 12 military observation posts inside Idlib aimed at monitoring a de-escalation zone and backs other rebel groups in the province - officially designated HTS as a ""terrorist organisation"".
Turkey's foreign minister, Mevlut Cavusoglu, told reporters on Friday that Ankara ""is trying to prevent an attack on Syria's Idlib, which could be a disaster"".
Cavusoglu echoed Grandi in saying that a new offensive could result in a fresh wave of refugees.
""It is important for all of us to neutralise these radical groups,"" he said. ""But we have to distinguish the civilians from the terrorist groups.""
Intense negotiations have been under way for weeks between Russia and Turkey, which hosts some three million Syrians and has already stated that it will not open its borders to accept further refugees in the event an assault takes place.
Meanwhile, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said the Syrian government had every right to chase fighters out of Idlib.
Syrian government forces ""had the full right to protect its sovereignty and to drive out, liquidate the terrorist threat on its territory"", Lavrov was quoted as saying by the Interfax news agency.
He also said that negotiations are under way to establish a humanitarian corridor for civilians to be able to leave Idlib. The UN on Thursday proposed establishing the corridor, which would channel civilians to government-held areas.
Speaking from Beirut, Al Jazeera's Zeina Khodr said that the UN has reiterated its long-standing position that due to Syria's instability, it is still premature to organise large-scale refugee returns.
""These returns cannot be, in the words of the head of the UNHCR, sustainable,"" she said.
Many refugees and internally displaced persons remain fearful of what awaits them in government-held areas, added Khodr.
""A lot of them are afraid of retribution,"" she explained. ""They fear that there are no safety guarantees in place to make sure the Syrian government does not take any measures against them simply for accusing them of supporting the opposition,"" she said.

Speaking at a press conference in Moscow with his Syrian counterpart Walid al-Muallem following a closed-door meeting, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov stated that the majority of Syria had been ""freed of terrorists"", save for Idlib, a northeastern province bordering Turkey.
""What we need to do now is to wipe out those terrorist groups which persist, particularly within the de-escalation area of Idlib,"" he said.
""It is unacceptable that those terrorists particularly al-Nusra Front are using the de-escalation area of Idlib to attack the Syrian army and to also attack through drones the Russian military bases in the area,"" he added referring to Hay'et Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), which is dominated by a rebel faction previously known as al-Nusra Front before renouncing its ties to al-Qaeda.
For his part, al-Muallem said the Syrian forces will ""go all the way"" in Idlib but added that the army will do everything possible to avoid civilian deaths.
Idlib is home to nearly three million people, up to half of whom are rebels and civilians transferred en masse from other areas such as Aleppo, Eastern Ghouta and Deraa after they fell to Syrian pro-government forces following heavy fighting.
The situation on the ground is further complicated by the direct presence of Turkey, which backs certain rebel groups in the area and operates as a guarantor power to ensure a ""de-escalation zone"" agreed upon with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's allies Russia and Iran at a meeting in Kazakhstan's capital, Astana.
In recent weeks, Turkish-backed opposition groups in Idlib have attempted to unify into a new coalition, with some 70,000 fighters pledging to fight against forces loyal to Assad. But HTS, the most dominant rebel force in Idlib and in control of about 60 percent of the province, has not joined the coalition.
A major military operation in Idlib would pose a particularly threatening humanitarian situation because there is no opposition territory left in Syria where people could be evacuated to. Observers have previously warned as many as 2.5 million Syrians could try to flee to the closed Turkish border, creating a new refugee crisis.
""The question is how costly the assault on Idlib is going to be,"" said Al Jazeera's Rory Challands, reporting from Moscow.
""It's not a question of if it will happen, it is a question of when and the severity of it,"" he added, noting that the Russian and Syrian governments believe that the seven-year war will largely be over if they capture Idlib.
Hundreds of thousands of people have been killed and millions displaced since Syria's war started in 2011 with the brutal repression of anti-government protests.
Speaking at the press conference, Lavrov called on the international community to join in the reconstruction process of Syria and ""actively get down to work on modernising the infrastructure which has been devastated"".
""We can see that there is a very swift mobilisation of the international community taking place particularly with regards to the return of the refugees and the revival of socioeconomic assets and facilities to make sure the country gets back to working order,"" he said.
""The Russians know that as the pre-eminent military force in Syria, some of the responsibility of rebuilding Syria falls on them,"" Challands said, ""but they don't want to shoulder all the bill, so they're encouraging as many foreign powers as they can to chip in essentially and get the country back on its feet.""
Al-Muallem said Russia and Syria are united in their views regarding the next stage of rebuilding Syria.
""It's natural to think about Syria to find a reconstruction programme and to find a role for our partners in Russia to play a key role and priority in this,"" he said, adding that both countries are very near to ""putting an end to terrorism"" in the country.
Both ministers warned against any ""act of aggression"" from Western countries, particularly from the United States, citing staged chemical attacks by ""provocateurs"" such as the Syrian civil defence group the White Helmets being used as a pretext for such assaults.
""This kind of provocation is being staged as to complicate the whole issue of combatting the terrorists in Idlib,"" Lavrov said. ""We have warned our Western partners clearly that they should not engage in this kind of activity.
Al-Muallem accused the US and its allies of preparing for ""another aggression to save al-Nusra Front"" and protract the Syrian conflict.
""We will practise our legitimate right in defending ourselves, but the consequences of the aggression will hit the political process definitely and everyone will be [affected],"" he said.
Turkey, which hosts some three million Syrian refugees, has already stated that it will not open its borders to accept further refugees in the event an assault takes place.
The Syrian government said that it will open ""humanitarian corridors"" for civilians to evacuate, but according to Al Jazeera's correspondent Zeina Khodr, many of the residents do not trust the government and remain fearful of their fate.
""Many of these people are considered terrorists or are wanted by the state simply because they engaged in opposition activities,"" Khodr said, reporting from Lebanon's capital, Beirut. ""Being a medic according to the Syrian government is terrorism.""
Earlier on Thursday, UN Syria envoy Staffan de Mistura warned that a potential ""perfect storm"" is looming over Syria's Idlib province, and expressed his willingness to ""personally and physically"" involve himself to ensure a corridor to evacuate civilians would be feasible.
While it is not yet clear what kind of offensive the Syrian government will engage in Idlib, Khodr said that there are still ""behind the scenes negotiations between the Russians and the Turks"" on this matter.
""What we understand from some sources is that Turkey is trying through its contacts in Idlib to convince Hay'et Tahrir al-Sham to disband itself to prevent this all-out offensive,"" she said.
""We even heard Lavrov tell the Syrian government 'we are talking about the need to reconcile with some groups' telling them in one way or another that there will not be a wide-scale attack.""
According to Alexey Khlebnikov, an expert with the Russian International Affairs Council, creating another refugee crisis will be contrary to Russia's main priorities and interests.
""This is why Russia is now trying to negotiate with Turkey to reach a compromise on the deal to minimise damage inflicted on the population in Idlib,"" he told Al Jazeera.
""Now, Russia's message to the West is to get on board and join in the reconstruction process and humanitarian aid [which] basically goes in line with that message of retaking Idlib and not creating another refugee flow.""
But Khodr said that Western countries are not prepared to join in the reconstruction, insisting first on a ""meaningful, credible, political transition"" to Syria.
""[The Russians] have sidelined the political transition which will involve the Syrian government sharing power with the opposition,"" she said, noting that Russia is trying to cement Assad's hold onto power.
The narrative for Russia and Syria is that they have won the war and now want to talk about rebuilding the country and returning the refugees, she said.
""They've appealed to the international community, particularly to the West, to give them money to rebuild the towns so that refugees will return and leave Europe but it seems they do not have the support as of yet,"" Khodr said.

Speaking at an event on Tuesday with the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a Washington DC-based neoconservative think-tank with pro-Israeli sympathies, Haley was asked whether she agreed with taking the right of return off the table.
""I think we have to look at this in terms of what's happening [with refugees] in Syria, what's happening in Venezuela,"" she said.
""So I absolutely think we have to look at the right of return.""
Palestinians view the right of return, along with the end of the Israeli occupation, as one of the basic tenants in achieving a peace deal with Israel.
Haley also accused the United Nations Relief and Work Agency (UNRWA) of exaggerating the number of Palestinian refugees it currently provides aid to and services for.
""We will be a donor if it [UNRWA] reforms what it does ... if they actually change the number of refugees to an accurate account, we will look back at partnering them,"" Haley said.
There are more than five million Palestinian refugees in the occupied territories and surrounding countries of Jordan, Syria and Lebanon.
The majority are descendants of the 700,000 Palestinians ethnically cleansed from their villages, towns and cities by Zionist paramilitaries in 1947-1948.
In response to the refugee crisis, UNRWA was created the following year under UN Resolution 302, which stated its mandate to ""prevent conditions of starvation and distress ... and to further conditions of peace and stability"".
Since its inception, UNRWA has worked with governments on interim measures in anticipation of a ""just resolution"" to the Palestinian refugee question.
Adnan Abu Hasna, spokesman for UNRWA in Gaza, said the issue of refugees is political by nature.
""Because of this, it falls upon the international community to come up with a political solution,"" he told Al Jazeera, adding this has nothing to do with a particular vision.
""We serve the Palestinian refugees until the Palestinian issue is resolved,"" he said. ""We execute what the resolution mandates. Once resolved, there is no need for UNRWA to exist.""
In January, the United States cut $300m out of $350m in funding for UNRWA, which forced the UN body to slash jobs and scale back its operations, much to the consternation of Palestinian employees and those who rely on its services.
Half a million Palestinian students in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip went back to the 692 schools operated by the UNRWA on Wednesday, but the agency said it only has enough money keep the them open until September.
Al Jazeera's Harry Fawcett said Israeli media has reported the US is intending to go further by restricting the definition of Palestine refugees to only those who were forcibly displaced in 1948.
""They're restricting the number from more than five million to 500,000, and indeed permanently cutting off all US funding to the UN agency,"" Fawcett said, reporting from occupied West Jerusalem.
""It is something that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has long argued for, both the restriction of the definition of Palestine refugees and also the disbandment of UNRWA entirely,"" he said, noting the agency provides food aid to more than one million Palestinians in the Gaza Strip.
The Donald Trump administration has made no secret of its hostile view of UNRWA. In emails leaked to Foreign Policy magazine earlier this month, Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law and senior adviser, described the agency in January as ""corrupt, inefficient, and doesn't help peace"".
During his visit to Jordan last June, Kushner reportedly pushed for the refugee status of the two million Palestinians registered in the country to be dissolved.
According to Fawcett, some Israeli military and security officials are worried about the repercussions of the moves.
""They have been telling the Israeli media that they are concerned about preventing UNRWA from operating because of the security implications that could have,"" he said.
""So there is by no means a total acceptance of this plan in the Israeli establishment.""

Speaking to local media on Wednesday, Temer said capping the number of migrants crossing into Roraima state could be necessary as local authorities in the area were being overwhelmed by the estimated 700 to 800 people currently arriving from Venezuela every day.
""We offered humanitarian aid - food and medicine [to Venezuela]. The government refused,"" he said, adding, ""the government refuses there, and Venezuelans come here.""
One option being considered is limiting the number of people entering each day to between 100 and 200, Temer said.
On Tuesday, Temer signed a decree to re-establish ""law and order"" in Roraima which will result in more troops being deployed to the border with Venezuela and grant armed forces policing powers within certain areas and along highways in the state. The decree is in effect until September 12.
About 70,000 Venezuelans have crossed the border into Brazil during the past year, according to government estimates, fleeing an economic collapse which has resulted in chronic shortages of basic supplies and rampant hyperinflation.
Thousands have settled in Roraima, where tensions between migrants and Brazilian nationals have become heightened in recent weeks.
Clashes between local residents and Venezuelans in the border town of Pacairama on August 18 forced several migrants to retreat back over the border into Venezuela.
The violence occurred fewer than two weeks after Brazil briefly closed its northern border to Venezuela following requests from local authorities, who have called for extra support from the federal government.
In February, Brazil declared a state of emergency in Roraima that led to a funding boost for the state and doubled the number of troops stationed at the border with Venezuela.
Al Jazeera's Lucia Newman, reporting from the Chilean capital, Santiago, said Temer's comments on Wednesday indicated the ongoing regional migration crisis was ""going from bad to worse"".
""The more and more Venezuelans try to cross the different borders into other parts of Latin America to escape the economic crisis at home, the more governments are beginning to put restrictions on them,"" Newman said.
Amnesty International's America Director Erika Guevara-Rosas, meanwhile, called on Temer to ""protect the rights of both its citizens and refugees"" in a post on Twitter.
""Refugees are not a security threat. Militarising the response to address challenges in receiving communities will only increase xenophobic attitudes. Brazil's state has international responsibilities to protect the rights of both its citizens and refugees,"" Guevara-Rosas said on Wednesday.

On Tuesday, immigration officials from Peru, Colombia and Brazil met in the Colombian capital, Bogota, to discuss strategies for coping with an influx of Venezuelan refugees.
Peru and Ecuador have in recent weeks begun denying entry to migrants travelling without valid passports, affecting hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans who were previously allowed to cross into both countries using only paper ID cards.
An estimated 1.6 million Venezuelans have fled the country since 2015, about 90 percent of whom went to other countries within the region, according to the UN's Refugee Agency.
Last week, the UN's International Organization for Migration (IOM) warned the crisis was ""building towards a crisis moment"".

The government issued notices to asylum seekers living in four migrant centres, announcing its intention to expel them because they were absent when police performed checks on August 13.
In Naples, asylum seekers hosted in centres have to sign in every night and comply with a 9pm curfew. But up until last week, the regulation had not been enforced. While it is not a nationwide rule, it is applied in other cities as well.
The decision is likely to have affected at least 100 people.
According to Francesco Priore, a lawyer at the Association for Juridical Studies on Immigration, a total of 146 appeals were filed, but some migrants may already be living elsewhere.
It was not the case for Max, a 19-year-old from Ghana, who told Al Jazeera he just popped out to get some snacks when the police went into the centre. Upon his return, it was too late to be counted in.
""Two or three days later, they brought a letter with the names of people who should leave,"" said Max, who gave only his first name. ""They want to put us in the street with nowhere to go.""
He said he's been waiting for an answer from the asylum commission for more than eight months after more than two years in Italy.
Often privately run, such centres have become the most common housing arrangement for asylum seekers waiting for an answer on their application. This can take upwards of two years.
While centres that do operate well exist, the system has been prone to abuse and mismanagement. Some facilities have even been investigated for mafia infiltration.
As part of a crackdown on migration that has included measures against boats rescuing migrants in the Mediterranean Sea, Italy's Interior Minister Matteo Salvini announced spending cuts for asylum-seeker reception facilities.
In Vasto near Naples' central train station where the centres are located, some citizens have voiced concerns about squalor, drug traffickers and street sellers - many of whom are migrants.
One of those vendors, Cisse Elhadji Diebel, a Senegalese national, was shot and wounded in the leg earlier this month as violent attacks on minorities escalate across the country.
Priore said the decision to kick people out of the centres could have repercussions on the application for international protection by those waiting to see the asylum commission, which sends all communication to the applicants' place of residence.
""If the applicant is not available for the interview, he could see his application judged solely on the base of the first declarations made,"" Priore said.
The government was not available for comment by the time of publication.
Associations opposing the government's crackdown on migration argue this could be a testing ground for a new policy to come.
""It's creating chaos which will then lead to further repression,"" said Pierluigi Umbriano of the anti-racist network Associazione 3 Febbraio.
""We will certainly see the situation exploited at the political level. We will hear that reception centres have been cleared, that migrants create problems on the street, with promises to send them away. There will be even more discontent,"" Umbriano told Al Jazeera.
Meanwhile, Boro, 28, a guest of one of the centres who found work in a restaurant, said he decided to quit after what happened.
""I can't do my evening shift or I would risk being kicked out,"" he said.

A man, identified as Daniel H by local media, was stabbed during an argument on Saturday. Two men, of Syrian and Iraqi origin, have been arrested by the police.
On Sunday, around 800 far-right activists rallied on the streets to protest the stabbing. But those who knew Daniel have accused the far-right of exploiting his death for their own benefit.
""I think it's horrible what's happening here in Chemnitz, and I hope that they know who they're doing this march for,"" Daniel's friend, Nancy Larssen, told Deutsche Welle (DW).
""I think it's sad that in the media they're just saying that a German has died, and that's why all the neo-Nazis and hooligans are out, but the media should describe who died, and what skin colour he had, because I don't think they'd be doing all this if they knew.""
State and local officials appealed for calm as thousands of people took to the streets in Monday's protests that turned violent after injuries caused by fireworks thrown from both sides.
Local media reported Neo-Nazis performing the Nazi salute, and local TV showed footage of skinheads chasing a man.
""The scenes of people going after those who look like foreigners scare us. We want to show that Chemnitz has another side that is cosmopolitan and opposes xenophobia,"" Tim Detzner, head of the radical left party in Chemnitz, said at the anti-fascist rally.
Demonstrators waving German and Bavarian flags were also present nearby, some breaking through police barriers aimed at keeping the two sides apart.
Spokesperson for German Chancellor Angela Merkel's said Germany would not tolerate ""vigilante justice"".
""We don't tolerate such unlawful assemblies and the hounding of people who look different or have different origins, and attempts to spread hatred on the streets,"" Steffen Seibert said at a regular news briefing.
The far-right has surged across Europe during the continent's migrant crisis and increasing political rhetoric against Islam.
Germany's far-right Alternative for Germany party (AfD) is now the main opposition party, and Merkel faces opposition within her governing coalition for her immigration policies.
More than a million people fleeing war and poverty in the Middle East have sought refuge in Germany since 2015.

It was the first time the United Nations explicitly called for Myanmar officials to face genocide charges over their campaign against the Rohingya, and is likely to deepen the Southeast Asian nation's isolation.
The UN mission found Myanmar's armed forces had taken actions that ""undoubtedly amount to the gravest crimes under international law"", forcing more than 700,000 Rohingya to flee starting in late August 2017.
Speaking in Geneva on Monday, Marzuki Darusman, the mission's chairman, said his researchers amassed evidence based on 875 interviews with witnesses and victims, satellite imagery, and verified photos and videos.
Marzuki said victim accounts were ""amongst the most shocking human rights violations"" he had come across and would ""leave a mark on all of us for the rest of our lives"".
He described Myanmar's military as having shown ""flagrant disregard for lives"" and displayed ""extreme levels of brutality"".
""The Rohingya are in a continuing situation of severe systemic and institutionalised oppression from birth to death,"" Marzuki said.
The UN does not apply the word ""genocide"" lightly.
Its assessment suggests crimes against the Rohingya could meet the strict legal definition used in places such as Bosnia, Rwanda and Sudan's Darfur region.
The team cited a ""conservative"" estimate from aid group Reporters Without Borders that some 10,000 people had been killed in the violence, but outside investigators have had no access to the affected regions, making a precise accounting elusive, if not impossible.
The UN report said military generals, including Commander-in-Chief Min Aung Hlaing, must face investigation and prosecution for ""genocidal intent"" in Myanmar's northern Rakhine state, as well as crimes against humanity and other war crimes in the states of Kachin and Shan.
The report singled out Myanmar's military, known as the Tatmadaw, but added that other Myanmar security agencies were also involved in abuses.
""Military necessity would never justify killing indiscriminately, gang-raping women, assaulting children, and burning entire villages,"" the report said.
""The Tatmadaw's tactics are consistently and grossly disproportionate to actual security threats, especially in Rakhine state but also in northern Myanmar.""
In Rakhine state, there was evidence of extermination and deportation, the report added.
""The crimes in Rakhine state, and the manner in which they were perpetrated, are similar in nature, gravity and scope to those that have allowed genocidal intent to be established in other contexts,"" the UN mission concluded, adding there was ""sufficient information"" to prosecute the military's chain of command.
Christopher Sidoti, a member of the investigatory committee, urged the UN Security Council and General Assembly to act on the report's findings.
""We are convinced the international community holds the key to dismantling the destructive veil of impunity in Myanmar,"" he said.
Mohammed Jamjoom, Al Jazeera's correspondent in Cox's Bazar
""What we've heard in the report really lines up with witness testimonies I've heard here.
For most of the past year, when official bodies of governance spoke about the atrocities committed in Rakhine state, they called it ethnic cleansing.
Now there's a very extensive UN fact-finding mission recommending that top tier military officials in Myanmar be prosecuted and investigated for genocide.
When the members of the panel in Geneva laid out their investigation, they said that they conducted 875 interviews, they talked about the destructive veil of impunity in Myanmar and they said that until that is lifted, the cycle of violence in Myanmar will continue.
They said there needs to be a mechanism by which these crimes can be prosecuted and the cycle of violence in Myanmar can be ended.
That's going to be very difficult, we don't know exactly where this goes. At some point, it will be presented to the UN Human Rights Council and then potentially to the UN Security Council.
But we must remember that Myanmar is not a signatory to the Rome Statute, so the International Criminal Court does not have jurisdiction.""
Investigators compiled a list of suspects, which included Min Aung Hlaing and other military commanders.
The mission said a full list of suspects will be made available to any credible body pursuing accountability, adding that the case should be referred to the International Criminal Court, or an ad hoc criminal tribunal.
Myanmar's civilian leadership also drew criticism for its failure to prevent the abuses.
""The State Counsellor, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, has not used her de facto position as Head of Government, nor her moral authority, to stem or prevent the unfolding events in Rakhine State,"" the report said.
UN report
The Nobel Peace Prize laureate has been criticised internationally for her failure to speak out against abuses in Rakhine State and has had several human rights awards rescinded for her stance.
In August 2017, Myanmar's armed forces launched a campaign ostensibly against Rohingya armed groups in Rakhine state.
Investigators documented mass killings, the destruction of Rohingya dwellings, and ""large-scale"" gang rape by Myanmar soldiers.
The UN's report drew praise from the ground in Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh, where refugee camps have taken in hundreds of thousands of Rohingya from across the border.
""We are happy for this. If these army people are punished the world will take note of it. They are killers. They must be punished,"" said Mohammed Hasan, 46, who lives in the Kutupalong refugee camp.
""They killed thousands, we have seen that. They torched our homes, that's a fact. They raped our women, that's not false.""

Many Venezuelans are choosing to leave their country as a result of the recession which has gone on for almost five years now. According to the UN, 1.6 million Venezuelans have fled the country since 2015, 90 percent of whom went to countries within South America.
""This is building to a crisis moment that we've seen in other parts of the world, particularly the Mediterranean,"" Joel Millman, IOM spokesperson, said on Friday.
""We have to start lining up priorities and funding and means to manage this as soon as we can.""

This week, Ecuador and Peru said those without valid passports would be denied entry, in a move affecting hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans who were previously allowed to cross the border with paper ID cards instead.
Since the announcement of the new passport rules, Colombia's migration authority said it recorded a decrease in traffic over official border crossings and an increase in the use of irregular crossings.
But only allowing those with a passport might lead to problems, Millman said.
""When we see things like passports only, we point out that there are a lot of migrants, particularly teenagers and unaccompanied children, that may not have access to these documents,"" said Millman.
Millman's remarks echoed statements by other UN agencies warning that the new passport requirement will expose people to ""further risk of exploitation, trafficking and violence"".
Andrej Mahecic, spokesperson for the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, called on other countries to help those fleeing Venezuela.
""We are concerned about these recent events, and the demonstrations against refugees, asylum seekers and migrants in some of the Latin American countries,"" said Mahehic.
""Those increase stigmatisation of those who are forced to flee, they put at risk the efforts of integration,"" he added. ""Solidarity is the key here.""

The latest assault took place after a coordinated attack by the Arkan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA) rebel group on a Myanmar police post and army base killed 12 security personnel.
For many of the Rohingya, who are not recognised by Myanmar as an ethnic group and are denied citizenship and government services, this was not the first time they had forcibly left their homes.
Previous waves of displacement took place in 1978, 1991 and 2016.
According to the Inter Sector Coordination Group (ISCG), over the past year there has been an influx of 919,000 refugees who have been displaced from their villages in Myanmar's Rakhine state.
They live in 32 camps in the Ukhiya and Teknaf sub-districts, or upazilas, of the tourist beach town Cox's Bazar, joining the 300,000 other Rohingya who were displaced in previous years.
The camps suffer from overcrowding and squalid conditions, with sanitation problems and lack of basic infrastructure.
About 200,000 Rohingya are at risk of landslides during the monsoon season, as the tarpaulin and bamboo shelters are built haphazardly on soft ground.
Last November, the Bangladeshi and Myanmar governments signed a repatriation deal where they agreed that the Rohingya that fled across the border would be returned to Rakhine state.
However, little is known about what the deal holds, and there has not been a single return yet.
Many of the Rohingya cite their fears of returning only to be forcibly displaced again in the future.
For this reason, they say they will not return unless their demands are met, such as for Myanmar to grant them citizenship, greater inclusivity in government services such as education and workforce, the ensuring of security and safety, and reparations for all that they have lost.
Al Jazeera spoke with refugees living in various camps in Cox's Bazar about whether they would return to their homelands and their thoughts on the repatriation deal.
Ali is from Taung Bazar village in the Buthidaung Township, where he used to be a local trader in food items.
He arrived in Jamtoli refugee camp last August with his wife, son and sister.
""I didn't know there was a repatriation deal. But I won't go back unless certain demands are met, such as granting the Rohingya people citizenship, for Myanmar to ensure greater security for us, and to give us compensation for all that we've lost.""
Gulsahar is from Taung Bazar and now lives in the Jamtoli refugee camp with her husband, Mohammad Shafi and her five children.
""I lost my sister and my nieces and nephews. They were killed by the Myanmar soldiers. I have made up my mind to stay here in Jamtoli until I die. Here, I receive help from the aid agencies. But even if the government of Bangladesh cuts off the aid, I would rather die from starvation than return to Rakhine.""
""I have three daughters and two sons. My eldest daughter is 20, and she is still unmarried. We are searching for a bridegroom.""
[Rohingya women tend to marry in their early teens because they fear getting raped by Myanmar soldiers, she said, adding that if the women are married, the soldiers lose interest]
Mahmud is from the Raballah village in Maungdaw Township. He is the eldest of seven siblings. He and his unmarried brothers live with their mother in Nayapara – Shalbagan refugee camp in Teknaf.
""I have no demands. I want to go back to my village without any compensation or conditions. I used to be a porter. Now I do nothing.""
""Every day I face many difficulties just to get food. I am dependent on aid. There are also hygiene problems, such as the lack of sanitary latrines. I don't know much about the repatriation deal.""
Mir is from Fukira Bazar in Maungdaw Township, where he was a farmer and owned 10 kani (1.6 hectares) of land. He now lives in Balukhali camp.
""I am married with two sons and one daughter. I am willing to go back to Rakhine if the Myanmar government meets our demands, such as compensation and recognising us as citizens.""
""Here I can get food and shelter. I feel better here than in my own village because there's more security. But I want to return to Fukira Bazar because there, I can live in dignity.""
Hujjatul is from a village in Maungdaw Township, and now lives with his parents, two brothers and two sisters in Kutupalong camp, in the unregistered bloc 11.
""I was in Year Three in school when I was in Rakhine. Now I can't find a proper school here except for the madrasahs where we learn the Quran. I haven't heard of any repatriation deal.""
""I'll go back if we have Rohingya recognition. We would much rather die here if Myanmar forces us to go back without granting us citizenship.""
She is from Bolibazar village in Maungdaw Township and now lives in the Kutupalong camp.
""I have nine children and a husband. It took us two days to reach Cox's Bazar. I saw so many massacres, rapes, and homes set on fire.
""I haven't heard of the repatriation deal. I would only go back if Myanmar granted us Rohingya recognition. I don't feel good here because this is not my land.""
I am grateful for the role of the Bangladeshi government and the aid agencies for helping us, but I want to live in dignity back in my own land.""
They are cousins from the Maungdaw Township. Amin has 10 kids and Ahmad has eight kids.
Nural Amin: ""We haven't heard of a repatriation deal. If the governments of both countries decide to physically return us to Rakhine, we have conditions that must be met first, like the Rohingya recognition and compensation.""
""I hope we won't be forced to go back without any guarantees. We would prefer to die here in a Muslim country and not among Buddhists.""
""This is our third time being displaced. The first was in 1978 and the second time in 1991. Every time we returned to Rakhine we faced torture and government repression.""
""We were fishermen and farmers in Myanmar. Even though Myanmar is our country, there is no way we would go back there again without security or conditions. Bangladesh is more peaceful.""

More than 15,000 gathered on Saturday at the Kutupalong refugee camp in Bangladesh's Cox's Bazar to demand justice for what they called ""genocide"" committed by Myanmar's forces.
On August 25, 2017, Myanmar launched a military offensive - termed by the UN as a textbook example of ethnic cleansing - after a Rohingya armed group carried out attacks on border security forces.
The ensuing violent crackdown forced more than 700,000 Rohingya to flee Rakhine State for neighbouring Bangladesh, living in squalid conditions in overcrowded camps.
""The refugees had to get special permission from the Bangladeshi authorities in order to stage these demonstrations,"" said Al Jazeera's Mohammed Jamjoom, reporting from Cox's Bazar, which has become home to the world's largest refugee settlement.
""We saw men, women, young and old, demanding their rights, demanding justice, pleading to the international community to do more to help them, but also saying that they want to make sure that the perpetrators of this genocide - the Myanmar army - need to be held to account and brought to justice by the International Criminal Court,"" he added.
Rohingya, one of the most persecuted communities in the world, have been denied citizenship and basic human rights by Myanmar's authorities since 1982.
Bangladesh signed a deal with Myanmar last year to allow the refugees to return, but the repatriation process has been stalled.
But little is know about the deal, and many of the Rohingya say they are afraid of returning only to be forcibly displaced again in the future.
Among their demands are for Myanmar to grant them citizenship, greater inclusivity in government services such as education and workforce, the ensuring of safety and security, as well as reparations for all that they have lost.
""We want to go back home,"" said Mohammad Elias, member of the Arakan Rohingya Society for Peace and Human Rights (ARSPH).
""We want to be citizens of our country. We want to live there with safety and security.""
Elias, who fled Rakhine state in August 2017 with his family, believes there is absolutely no excuse for the Rohingya not to be recognised as citizens of Myanmar.
""Our mothers and fathers are from Myanmar,"" he told Al Jazeera.
""We were also born there but still they made us suffer. They didn't let us get an education. They didn't even let us pray in the mosque.""
The UN's refugee agency, UNHCR, estimates that children make up 55 percent of the total Rohingya refugee population in Bangladesh.
A family-counting exercise conducted in December 2017 by UNHCR found more than 5,500 families being led by children under 18.
More than half a million Rohingya refugee children are being denied the chance of a proper education, UNICEF said in a report marking one year since the start of the latest influx of Rohingya into Bangladesh.
Many arrived at the camps unaccompanied - either separated from their families or orphaned.
""From the outset, this has truly been a children's crisis,"" said Daphnee Cook, a representative for the UK-based non-profit Save the Children.
""Many children have seen their parents killed in front of them, they've had to endure long, hard journeys where they have arrived here with basically no food and then they've had to survive now in these camps for about a year now,"" she told Al Jazeera in an interview at Cox's Bazar.
""It's horrible,"" she added. ""It's not a place where children should be living.""

Among those kidnapped, who are mostly of members of the minority Druze community, are at least 16 children aged between seven and 15, the human rights group said on Saturday, citing witnesses and relatives.
Local residents told HRW that ISIL (also known as ISIS) is planning to use the hostages as leverage in negotiations with the Syrian government and Russia, one of Syria's closest allies.
""For a month now, families of the kidnapped Sweida have been calling for the release of their loved ones,"" Lama Fakih, HRW's deputy Middle East director, said in a statement.
""Civilian lives should not be used as bargaining chips, and ISIS should release all the hostages immediately.""
The children were taken during attacks in late July on several villages in the eastern parts of Sweida, HRW said.
Several witnesses told the human rights group that 57 people were killed in the attack, after which 27 were taken by members of ISIL.
Following the attacks, the armed group released videos showing kidnapped women, with one stating that they would be killed if the Syrian government did not stop its assault on Yarmouk, a besieged Palestinian refugee camp held by ISIL in the south of Damascus.
In the weeks following the attacks, local media reported the beheading of 19-year-old Muhannad Abu Ammar at the hands of his ISIL kidnappers.
A woman named Zaya, also taken hostage by ISIL, died of unknown causes several days later.
Sweida province has largely been spared most of the violence that Syrian cities have witnessed in the years since the conflict started in 2011.
In less than a month, Syrian government forces, backed by Russian air power, have been able to seize control of most of southwestern Deraa province, including the provincial capital of the same name.
Alongside the military offensive, the government has also struck ""reconciliation"" deals, essentially a negotiated capitulation of a number of villages that have been in rebel hands for years, to restore government control there.

Idlib is the last remaining opposition stronghold in the country. It is home to about three million people, half of whom are internally displaced.
If the forces loyal to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad press ahead with an offensive, observers say as many as 2.5 million Syrians could try to flee to the shuttered Turkish border, creating a new refugee crisis.
On Friday, Turkey's Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu warned against the possible assault, while offering to work with Syria's ally, Russia, to pursue a ceasefire in the area and prevent a mass exodus.
Many in Idlib are already preparing themselves for the worst case scenario.
""We won't leave our nation alone again, we will defend our people until the last breath,"" Ahmad Ghajar, an Idlib resident, told Al Jazeera.
Meanwhile, Muhammad al-Hajj Marai, owner of a candy shop, said the possible Syrian government assault ""does no difference"".
""Why should I be scared? Assad has already been killing us for seven years - our families, brothers, and sisters, even the children.""
Since the conflict, Idlib has provided a refuge for many Syrians fleeing other parts of the country, including after government offensives targeting other rebel-held parts of the country.
The so-called Syrian Salvation Government is a civil authority formed in Idlib last year, and is backed by Hay'et Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), the dominant rebel group in the province.
""It will be a disaster and a catastrophe if such an attack happens, because even rich and able governments can't evacuate three or four million people quickly in such difficult conditions that we are living in,"" said Jamal Shahoud, deputy prime minister of the Syrian Salvation Government.
Opposition groups in Idlib are attempting to unify into a ""National Army"", with Turkey's help, to try and overcome any divisions to fight the Syrian government. Some 70,000 fighters have pledged to fight against Assad's forces.
But HTS has not offered its support yet.
Syrian forces have already dropped leaflets over Idlib, calling for rebel groups to surrender.
For now, those living in Syria's last opposition stronghold can only wait and see what happens next.

The Diciotti vessel has been docked at the Sicilian port of Catania since Monday night, after Italy's far-right Interior Minister and co-Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini blocked its 150 passengers - mostly refugees from Eritrea - from disembarking in the absence of an agreement from other European member states to share the responsibility of relocation.
Eleven women and five men - two of whom are suspected to have tuberculosis - were given permission by Italian authorities to get off on Saturday, following an onboard visit by doctors requested by the health ministry, the interior ministry confirmed.
Red Cross official Stefano Principato told reporters on the dock in Catania on Saturday that beyond medical concerns, there is also worry about the psychological well-being of the migrants who were rescued off the Maltese coast on August 16.
Of the 190 people originally on board the Diciotti, 27 unaccompanied children and 13 others had previously been allowed to disembark.
Also on Saturday, the UN's refugee agency, UNHCR, called on EU countries to ""urgently offer relocation"" to those confined to Diciotti and urged Italian authorities to allow disembarkation.
""The time has come to end the back-and-forth that has seen countries competing in a race to the bottom on who can take the least responsibility for people rescued at sea,"" Filippo Grandi, the UN high commissioner for refugees, said in a statement.
""It is dangerous and immoral to put the lives of refugees and asylum seekers at risk while states engage in a political tug-of-war on long-term solutions,"" he added.
The Diciotti is the latest in a string of cases which saw Italy, as well as Malta, refuse or delay the disembarkation of people rescued in the central Mediterranean, often after spending many months in detention in Libya.
Representatives of 12 EU member states met on Friday to seek long-term solutions to the issue of migrant rescues in the Mediterranean Sea.
But the talks ended without producing a solution for the stranded refugees and migrants, with member states failing to agree on new standard procedures for the redistribution of migrants.
Luigi di Maio, Italy's industry minister and co-deputy prime minister, later said that Rome was prepared to withhold its EU contributions if there was no solution to the migration quagmire, reiterating a threat made before Friday's talks.
Since Italy adopted a hard stance on sea rescues, stand-offs on disembarkation to Italian and Maltese ports have been resolved with ad-hoc agreements.
In July, several European countries promised to relocate 270 out of more than 400 migrants and refugees that had arrived in the Sicilian port of Pozzallo.

By mid-August, they had made contacts with Venezuelans in Peru who could help them get housing and jobs, sold off a few possessions and raised money from family members to make their trip.
But with the announcement by Ecuadorian and Peruvian officials last week that their countries would begin denying entry to those crossing their borders without passports, the plans of many Venezuelans hoping to flee were suddenly put up in the air.
For Suarez and his friends, however, they never considered giving up.
""What choice do we have but to migrate?"" he said, standing with his friends beside piled luggage at the bustling Venezuelan border on Friday.
Suarez, a former construction worker from Valencia, is an example of the thousands of Venezuelans who prefer to try their luck at freshly tightened borders over weathering the poverty and hunger of their own crumbling country.
""If they don't let us through, we'll find a way to get through,"" Suarez told Al Jazeera.
According to the UN, there were more than 2.3 million Venezuelans living abroad as of June. Nearly half a million entered Peru from 2017 through June of this year, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs reported.
The mass exodus has been driven, in part, due to hyperinflation. The country continues to suffer from food and medicine shortages and a political crisis that has left much of the country polarised.
At the Simon Bolivar International Bridge connecting Colombia and Venezuela, tens of thousands of people cross every day. Most dip into Colombia to buy food or medicine then return home. The rest line the roadway, seated in the shade atop the heaps of luggage they packed to start a new life abroad.
Many Venezuelans who cross the border do so with no documents or only a paper id. Most can't afford the more than $1,000 in bribes or several months of waiting required to get a passport as Venezuela's bureaucracy crumbles. ""The price of the passport has gone up because it's all controlled by mafias,"" said Iren Garcia, a 37-year-old refinery worker from Lara state.
""The majority of Venezuelans want to leave but don't have resources,"" he told Al Jazeera.
But for others, the desperation has driven them to make the journey without a passport in hopes of making it to their final destination.
Carlos Brisuela , 41, sat with his friend on a Colombian street curb near the Venezuelan border, holding their luggage and pondering their next move. They are aiming to make it to Ecuador, where they hope friends will help get them a job.
Neither could feed their families, even though they full-time jobs in Puerto la Cruz in eastern Venezuela, so the two men sold Brisuela's car and made the two-day travel to Colombia, sleeping in bus terminals along the way.
""We don't have money. We don't have anywhere to go. We came in the hands of God,"" Brisuela told Al Jazeera. ""We're going in search of a better life.""
On Friday, Ecuador reportedly opened a humanitarian corridor to allow the hundreds of Venezuelans who had arrived at its borders to pass to Peru.
The reports surfaced as Ecuador's public defender's office, which had challenged the new passport rules, announced on Twitter that a judge had ruled against the restrictions because they ""had no effect"". The news came just hours before Peru was set to tighten its borders.
Prior to that announcement, Colombian authorities said they feared the recent decisions by Ecuador and Peru to shut their borders to those without passports would only drive more migrants and refugees into the shadows.
""Asking for passports from a nation that doesn't have them, and whose government doesn't facilitation the issuance of such document, incentivises irregularity,"" said Christian Kruger, head of Colombia's migration authority, in a statement Thursday.
Since the announcement of the new passport rules last week, Colombia's migration authority said it has recorded a decrease in traffic over official border crossings and an increase in the use of irregular crossings. Detailed figures were not yet available.
Colombia on Monday will host immigration authorities from Ecuador and Peru with hopes of developing a collaborative approach.
""We should find common practices that allow for a documented, ordered and safe migration,"" Kruger said.
Migration authorities in Ecuador and Peru did not immediately respond to Al Jazeera's requests for comment.
On Thursday, the UN and the International Organization for Migration urged Latin American countries to ease access for Venezuelans fleeing their country's economic and political crisis.
""We recognise the growing challenges associated with the large-scale arrival of Venezuelans,"" UN refugee agency chief Filippo Grandi said in a statement.
Back at the border, Rafael Mantilla, a 35-year-old sushi chef from Caracas, waited with his son.
Mantilla, who, unlike most, had resources to flee to Colombia earlier this year, worked six months in Bogota to raise money to help pay for his family's move.
Last week, he returned to Caracas to pick up his 12-year-old son, Daniel, and take him to Quito, Ecuador, where a contact has promised him work in a sushi kitchen.
Neither Mantilla nor his son has a passport. On Saturday night they'll take a bus to the Ecuadorian border.
""I can't pass up this opportunity,"" he said. ""I don't believe they will stop me.""

There are more than one million Rohingya living in 32 camps in Cox's Bazar district after having fled persecution and a violent militarised crackdown by the Myanmar army.
In addition to contagious and non-communicable viruses, the refugees remain at risk of landslides from heavy rains.
For Peter Salama, the World Health Organization's (WHO) emergency response chief, the magnitude of the risks posed by these conditions was overwhelming.
""I realised how fragile the environment was from a human and ecological perspective,"" said Salama.
""These camps are kind of incubations for disease because of the overcrowding. But with the luck and great efforts, massive outbreaks have been prevented.""
The WHO has partnered with more than 110 organisations on the ground to cater to the health needs of the Rohingya refugees.
Due to their systematic exclusion from government services, the Rohingya received almost no immunisation while living in Myanmar's Rakhine state. That is why the first thing the WHO did was to launch comprehensive vaccination programmes.
""Within weeks of the population crossing the border, there was an unprecedented cholera vaccination programme that prevented the population from contracting that disease,"" said Salama.
Khalid Eltahir, WHO's Incident Manager in Bangladesh, said that there is a multi-sector action plan in place whenever a disease outbreak is detected.
""We also have disease surveillance in place on a daily and weekly basis,"" said Eltahir.
""For vector-borne diseases like malaria and dengue, and water-borne diseases like cholera, we act immediately.""
Yet there were some scares too, such as the re-emergence in November of diphtheria, a disease that has been largely eliminated in western countries.
Diphtheria - an infectious disease that can be transmitted through direct physical contact or indirect respiratory contact with an infected person's coughs or sneezes - has a higher mortality rate in young children. Its symptoms include a sore throat, low fever, and swollen glands in the neck.
""There has been almost 8,000 cases,"" said Suraj Man Shrestha, the head of WHO's health operations in Cox's Bazar.
Shrestha added that while the diphtheria outbreak was contained, ""there is still a lot of work to be done"".
""We had a series of immunisation campaign rounds so that the Rohingya would be protected for the rest of their lives, bringing in resources from within WHO as well as partnering with organisations like UNICEF whose mandate is to support vaccines,"" he said.
One challenge that these campaigns faced was that some children, who form the majority of the camps' population, were missed at the time the inoculations were administered. Shrestha said that in these instances, it was important to engage community mobilisers, health volunteers, imams, and the mazis (Rohingya community leaders) to create awareness.
""This would encourage the community on health-seeking behaviour, and questions among themselves like 'Have you been vaccinated?' 'Have you?' 'I am protected from this disease',"" he said.
Sadia Afrin, a young Bangladeshi woman who works in the camps as a field immunisation monitor, said that at the beginning of last year's influx, there was a prevailing sense of mistrust from the Rohingya regarding getting vaccinated.
""The general attitude at first was deep-rooted in mistrust,"" she said. ""They regarded immunisation as necessary only for those who were sick.""
Shakira Khatun, who arrived at the Balukhali camp last August, said that she was, at first, wary of immunisation shots when she took her then two-year-old child to a health centre.
""We didn't know what the vaccinations were for when we were in Myanmar,"" Shakira explained. ""No one told us anything about immunisation.""
Shrestha said that there was a common misconception among the Rohingya that vaccinations would make them sterile, but they were open to learning about the importance of receiving shots.
""They did not go into hiding when the campaigns were running,"" he said. ""They were forthcoming to receive the vaccines.""
Afrin agreed, saying that ""it took time to build trust and awareness, but with the help of Rohingya community leaders, attitudes are now generally positive"".
""First, these mobilisation campaigns would hold a meeting with the target community, then the vaccination would be administered.""
Another Rohingya mother, Rahema, credits the community mobilisers for raising awareness through campaigns and consultations even before the camp population started swelling last year.
""That's how I came to know about the vaccination programme and what it is for,"" the pregnant 25-year-old mother-of-three said.
""I've been living in Kutupalong camp for eight years, and all of my children were vaccinated.""
Afrin said children under the age of two are now vaccinated against 10 diseases including diptheria, tetanus, Hepatitis B (through the pentavalent vaccine), rubella, pneumococcal diseases (through the PCV) and tuberculosis (through the BCG vaccine).
""Pregnant women are inoculated with Tetanus-Diphtheria, which protects newborns from whooping cough,"" she said.
A problem the health sector as a whole faces in the Rohingya camps is the lack of financial resources, with Eltahir pointing out that it is ""one of the poorly funded areas"".
""The health sector up until now is supported by 19 percent by the Joint Response Plan that was launched in March,"" he said.
Shrestha said that long-term sustainability must be looked into.
""A lot has been done one year on and we still have funds flowing in, but should the donor fatigue set in, then we need to start looking into sustainability because lives matter,"" he said.
""This is about preventing diseases and deaths.""
The long-standing health issue, according to Salama, is trauma from being exposed to violence, including gender-based violence and witnessing acts of violence.
""The Rohingya population have been through very traumatic experiences, such as watching loved ones being killed, injured, or maimed and being separated from their family,"" he said.
According to Shrestha, the WHO is discussing building the capacity of health workers to identify trauma and provide psycho-social support to those who need it, including substance abusers.
""We have a team of 19-20 experts looking into this,"" he said. ""MSF [Doctors Without Borders] has brought in 12 experts on mental health and psycho-social support, and that's a real asset.""
Salama was quick to praise the efforts of Bangladesh, which opened its borders to the Rohingya.
""What we really need is international solidarity, especially considering that the Bangladeshi government has been extremely generous in accepting these refugees and dealing with all of the social crises that have resulted,"" Salama said.
""They deserve all of our support and solidarity.""

Unlike mainland South Korea, Jeju offered visa-free arrival for various nationalities, including Yemenis, to boost tourism.
But the arrival of Yemenis, mostly from Malaysia - to which they fled from war-torn Yemen - sparked an online outcry and protests on the island, as well as the capital, Seoul.
The refugees are barred from leaving Jeju and entering mainland South Korea and are only permitted to work on farms, the sea or restaurants, often doing long hours of manual labour. Some complain of not being paid after working for more than a month.
More than 700,000 South Koreans filed an online petition urging the government to stop its visa-free policy for Yemen.
Protesters demanded the government to refuse asylum and deport the Yemenis.
A recent survey of more than 500 Jeju residents revealed almost 90 percent felt insecure about going outside since the arrival of the Yemenis.
Al Jazeera spoke to Jeju residents to see how they felt about the asylum seekers and what the Korean government's next steps should be.
People around me are sceptical about the visa-free policy. I think the government should accept refugees based on their nationalities and avoid people from countries that have terrorism issues. The fact that Jeju accepted these people is causing fear and anxiety among the residents.
The Yemenis are scary. They will rape our women, take our jobs and take over the country.
I'm scared of going to the areas where they are living. They are known for reckless behaviour. If I go to places where they are based, I'm very scared. Employers are reluctant to hire them because they are scared, too.
Lots of people are telling me that this visa-free policy is a problem and might cause terrorism problems for Jeju island in the future.
(When asked, Minja said she has never met a Yemeni or been to the areas they are living in but she heard all those things from people around her).
As a Korean who knows about war, I believe the government's action to accept refugees is an understandable one and not a bad move. But we have no information about them. We don't know who they are.
I don't think they are all bad people. I think deporting them will be too harsh and not a good idea. I think there needs to be a conversation between the government and Jeju's residents. They should start a dialogue to solve the issue. And I feel a lot of people around me have the same thoughts.
I've been on Jeju Island for about four months and have managed to make a Yemeni friend who visits my cafe daily.
He's learning Korean and he practises it with me. And I'm learning about Yemeni culture.
I think the government should educate these asylum seekers and tell them about Korean culture. A lot of women and children here are scared of these Yemenis because they walk around in groups. They should avoid that.
I finish work at 10pm and when I see them walk around in a group, I get scared too.
Also, they are Muslims and have a prayer culture. But they should make a bigger effort to learn about our culture so we can live together.
We need to learn from the Korean War - how other countries stepped in to help us out.
Based on that, we should accept these asylum seekers, but not everyone. I don't think we can accept everyone but we should sort this out quickly and accept some of them.
I think a lot of people and organisations here are overreacting to the issue because there is a lot of fake news around. People are worried and concerned because of that.
We should provide them with good conditions and shelter because they are from a country devastated by the war. I hope they can get their wounds healed here in Korea.
This is the first time Jeju residents are going through this situation, that's why they are a bit surprised. I haven't come across any Yemenis yet but I get my information through social media. There is a lot of advertising going on to help these people.
I feel for these people. They need help. I went to the immigration centre and told them I'm ready to help if someone needs it. I have given shelter to five Yemenis and I'm also teaching them Korean because they need to interact with the community to allay those fears.
The bible tells us to take care of the vulnerable around you. And that's exactly what I'm doing. These people now need jobs. The government has only allowed them three types of jobs - farming, fishing, restaurant [workers] - and banned them from working anywhere else because they think these people will steal the locals' jobs.
I don't have any bad feelings for these people but if I talk to people around me, they are quite against them because of the religion and their security fears.
I think the government should take time in evaluating these applications. We have seen what's happened in Europe with countries that have accepted refugees from these countries.
A lot of people on Jeju are very conservative and the local media is depicting these people in a negative way.
For me, the issue will be population growth, traffic jams and public facilities being put under strain because of an increase in the island's population.

The call on Thursday came after Ecuador and Peru announced tighter entry requirements for Venezuelans.
""We recognise the growing challenges associated with the large scale arrival of Venezuelans,"" UN refugee agency chief Filippo Grandi said in a statement issued jointly with the International Organization for Migration. ""It remains critical that any new measures continue to allow those in need of international protection to access safety and seek asylum,"" Grandi added.
Led by President Nicolas Maduro, Venezuela has been struggling with hyperinflation, economic recession and shortages of essential goods, including food and medicine, as well as a political crisis that has left much of the country polarised.
According to the UN, 1.6 million Venezuelans have fled the country since 2015, 90 percent of whom went to countries within South America.
This week, Ecuador and Peru said that those without valid passports would be denied entry, in a move affecting hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans who were previously allowed to cross the border with paper ID cards instead.
The UN agencies warned that the new passport requirement will expose people to ""further risk of exploitation, trafficking and violence"".
Ecuador recently declared a state of emergency in three northern states and has called for a regional summit to discuss the mass exodus, which sees up to 4,200 Venezuelans arriving in the country daily.
""It is the moment to exchange opinions, to see what different countries are doing in different aspects,"" Santiago Chavez, Ecuador's vice minister for human mobility, said in a statement on Wednesday.
""The worst that can happen to the country [Ecuador] is migratory chaos,"" he added.
Al Jazeera's Mariana Sanchez, reporting from the Ecuador-Peru border, said that ""there is a lot of anxiety among all these Venezuelans who are trying to get into Peru"" before a Saturday deadline where they will be required to have a passport to cross the border.
""There is a lot of expectation that there will be a lot of people coming here in the next few days,"" she added.
For its part, Colombia on Wednesday said it wanted a special UN envoy and a ""multilateral emergency fund"" to help manage the mass exodus. More than a million people have entered Colombia in the past 16 months alone.
Colombia has granted 800,000 of them temporary residence, but many want to travel onwards to Peru, Chile or even Argentina, which has taken in more than 30,000 Venezuelans under a law that allows foreign nationals to remain in the country ""when there are exceptional reasons of a humanitarian nature"".
""What is happening in Venezuela is of such gravity that it looks as though we were going through a terrible war like Syria - except there is no war,"" Trino Marquez, a sociologist in Venezuela's capital, Caracas, told Al Jazeera.
""And there is the expectation that things will get even worse,"" Marquez added.
Many Latin American governments initially welcomed the migrants with open arms, remembering Venezuela's role in welcoming those fleeing dictatorships and conflicts in the past.
But the exodus has ballooned this year, stretching social services, creating more competition for low-skilled jobs and stoking fears of unrest.
Earlier this week, residents in a northern Brazilian town drove hundreds of Venezuelans back over the border.
""There have been days of tension at the border between Brazil and Venezuela, especially at the town of Pacaraima where a shelter where Venezuelans were living was attacked and set on fire, with a group of Brazilians pushing about 1,000 Venezuelans to the Venezuelan side of the border,"" said Al Jazeera's Teresa Bo, reporting from Boa Vista, the capital of the northern state of Roraima.
She added that those who had managed to come back were living in shelters.
""I cannot go back to my country, we cannot survive there,"" Ricardo Rondon, a Venezuelan in Pacaraima, told Al Jazeera.
""It's a disaster and I won't go back as long as Nicolas Maduro is in power. We are stranded.""
On August 20, Maduro's government rolled out a new currency, slashing five zeroes from the bolivar in a bid to tame the country's rampant hyperinflation.
The new bolivar, which will be in circulation alongside the old currency during a transitional period, will be pegged to the country's state-backed cryptocurrency, the petro.
Maduro, who says that he is the victim of a US-led ""economic war"" designed to sabotage his administration through sanctions, said that using the petro will abolish the ""tyranny"" of the dollar and lead to an economic rebirth in Venezuela, an OPEC member state and home to the world's biggest crude oil reserves.
But many fear the measures could worsen the situation.
""There has been complete confusion and paralysis since these new reforms came into place,"" said Al Jazeera's Lucia Newman from Caracas.
""There is little confidence that these new measures are going to make things better ... and people believe that the only way out of this crisis is leaving this country,"" Newman added.
But for many, this is not a realistic option. The country has all but stopped issuing passports due to ink and paper shortages, as well as bureaucratic problems. Those who can afford it have paid fees and bribes upwards of $2,000 to get a new passport.
""I need to leave but how? There is no way to get a passport unless you pay $2,000 under the table, which I don't have,"" a Venezuelan citizen told Al Jazeera.
Venezuela's gross domestic product (GDP) has dropped by about 45 percent since Maduro took office in April 2013, according to the International Monetary Fund.
""There is no work, I can't support my family or buy milk or diapers for my baby, so I have no choice but to leave,"" Alejandro Blanco, another Caracas resident, told Al Jazeera.

In a report published on Wednesday, HRW called for the Hungarian government to adhere to its legal obligations and ensure that all asylum seekers in custody are provided with sufficient and appropriate food.
""The government has stooped to a new inhumane low by refusing food to people in their custody, apparently revelling in breaching human rights law, including its obligations as a European Union member,"" said Lydia Gall, Eastern EU and Balkans researcher at HRW.
""This disregard for people's wellbeing smacks of a cynical move to force people to give up their asylum claims and leave Hungary"".
The migrants are held in the two transit centres on the border with Serbia. They are not allowed to leave during the processing of their application unless they choose to return.
Two Afghan families and two Syrian brothers are among those denied food after their asylum applications were rejected under a new admissibility procedure.
While a breastfeeding woman and children in the Afghan families were provided with food, they were prohibited from sharing it with other family members, the families' legal representatives told HRW.
The European Court of Human Rights (EUCHR) ordered Hungary on August 10 to resume food distribution for the two Afghan families and has since issued similar orders in response to three other appeals, including on behalf of the Syrian brothers.
While Hungarian authorities respected the orders so far, dozens of other rejected asylum seekers may face food deprivation, according to HRW.
Hungary's Immigration and Asylum Office on August 20 argued that there is nothing in Hungarian law that obliges authorities to provide food to people in the ""aliens policing procedure"" in transit zones.
However, HRW noted that authorities have binding obligations under multiple human rights treaties and norms that prohibit inhumane treatment of those in their custody. Authorities are required to treat those under their custody with humanity which includes providing them food, water, hygiene and medical needs.
In its report, HRW called for the government to amend their legislation to ensure that everyone in a transit zone, regardless of the status of their applications, has their basic needs met.
On August 20, a pastor, Gabor Ivanyi, was denied access when he tried to deliver food to people in the transit zones during a national holiday known as the Festival of the New Bread.
Currently, a young woman from Afghanistan is at the receiving end of Hungary's policy, but similar cases are likely to emerge in the coming days, Andras Lederer of the Hungarian Helsinki Committee, (HHC) a human rights watchdog, told dpa news agency. The woman had appealed against the decision by Hungarian immigration authorities to refuse her asylum. HHC sued Hungary last week at the EUCHR on her behalf.
""It’s completely outrageous and absurd that people have to turn to the courts to get a slice of bread,"" Gall said.
""EU institutions should take this latest attack on people's rights, add it to the large file of rule of law and human rights concerns in Hungary, and send a clear message that blatantly abusing asylum seekers and flouting EU rules will have serious consequences.""
Hungary's populist Prime Minister Viktor Orban took a harsh stance on refugees and migrants during the 2015-16 migration crisis. His country was the first to stop people from entering and has passed laws aimed at discouraging migrants from attempting a transit or from seeking asylum.
HRW noted in its report that since 2015, the Orban government has ""engaged in a virulent campaign"" against migrants and asylum seekers, including attempts to demonise organisations that provide legal and humanitarian assistance to these groups.
One of the targets has been George Soros, the Hungarian-born philanthropist billionaire known for funding NGOs and development organisations worldwide.

Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said after talks on Monday with his Lebanese counterpart, Gibran Bassil, the US' refusal to provide assistance for rebuilding Syria after more than seven years of fighting would deter Syrians from returning to their homes.
Lavrov said the United Nations' political affairs department last year sent out ""a secret directive forbidding organisations belonging to [the UN] system from any project aimed at restoring the Syrian economy"".
Russia has been the chief backer of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, helping his forces to regain control over most of the country. Now, Moscow is calling on Western countries, which backed the opposition, to help fund reconstruction efforts, saying it would reduce the flow of refugees and migrants to Western Europe.
Lavrov bristled at the US and its Western allies for making assistance to Syria contingent on a political transition process. He also accused the West of pressuring the United Nations to stay away from reconstruction efforts in Syria.
He said Moscow is looking into why the UN cultural agency, UNESCO, is dragging its feet on the reconstruction of world-famous archaeological sites in the Syrian city of Palmyra. He said the UN Secretariat's political department has explicitly banned any involvement in reconstruction in Syria pending a political settlement.
Lavrov added he protested the move in a phone conversation with UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres.
""It's inadmissible when a group of countries manipulates secretariats of international organisations, which are supposed to be unbiased and independent,"" Lavrov said.
""The UN was created on the basis of ... equality of all countries. I strongly urge our Western partners to return to that principle and not try to covertly exploit international organisations.""
He also criticised recent comments by Filippo Grandi, the head of the UN refugee agency, who said last week it was too soon to talk about the mass repatriation of the more than five million Syrian refugees.
Lavrov said the UNHCR should not be a ""subsidiary of a group of Western countries"".
The Russian foreign minister also alleged that al-Qaeda fighters located near al-Tanf, in southeastern Syria where US military advisers are based, had launched raids intended to prevent refugees from returning from Jordan.
Bassil said Lebanon, which is hosting more than one million refugees, fully supports Russian efforts to help Syrians return.
""Lebanon supports the quick and safe return of Syrian refugees without any link to a political solution,"" Bassil said. ""The circumstances in Syria have changed and many areas are safe, and for that reason, there is no reason for the refugees to stay.""
Several thousand Syrian refugees in Lebanon have started to return to their homes in Syria voluntarily in recent months.
Some Lebanese officials have pushed for speedy returns, but the UN and human rights groups say conditions are still not safe in Syria.
Bassil said also said Lebanon should serve as a platform for the economic revival of Syria, and ensured Beirut would coordinate its efforts with Moscow, Interfax news agency reported.
On Saturday, Russian President Vladimir Putin spoke about international reconstruction efforts and the humanitarian situation in Syria with German Chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin.
""It's important to help those areas that the refugees can return to,"" said Putin, whose decision for Russia to militarily intervene in Syria's conflict in 2015 tilted the odds in favour of Assad, who has regained large swaths of land from armed rebel groups.
""I think it's in everyone's interests, including Europe's.""

""Burmese security forces have engaged in violent campaigns against ethnic minority communities across Burma, including ethnic cleansing, massacres, sexual assault, extrajudicial killings, and other serious human rights abuses,"" Treasury Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence Sigal Mandelker said on Friday.
""Treasury is sanctioning units and leaders overseeing this horrific behaviour as part of a broader US government strategy to hold accountable those responsible for such wide-scale human suffering,"" Mandelker added.
The sanctions were imposed on military commanders Aung Kyaw Zaw, Khin Maung Soe and Khin Hlaing and border police commander Thura San Lwin, in addition to the 33rd and 99th Light Infantry Divisions.
The measures call for freezes of any US assets the individuals hold, a prohibition on Americans doing business with them, as well as travel bans.
The sanctions by the Treasury Department marked the toughest US action so far in response to Myanmar’s crackdown on the Rohingya minority, in which thousands were killed and more than 700,000 people fled to neighbouring Bangladesh.
But the sanctions did not target the highest levels of Myanmar's military and also stopped short of calling the anti-Rohingya campaign crimes against humanity or genocide, which has been the subject of debate within the US government.
The measures were announced as Secretary of State Mike Pompeo prepares to issue the findings of an intensive US investigation of alleged atrocities by Myanmar authorities against the Rohingya in Rakhine state.
The release of the report, compiled from interviews at refugee camps in Bangladesh, is expected to coincide with the August 25 one-year anniversary of the bloody crackdown.
The military in Myanmar, also known as Burma, has denied accusations of ethnic cleansing and says its actions were part of a fight against terrorism.
Critics have accused US President Donald Trump of being slow in his response to the Rohingya crisis.
Human Rights Watch has called the sanctions ""an important but long overdue step"".
""The avoidance of the top military leaders is striking,"" Myanmar researcher Rich Weir said, adding: ""The likelihood that they did not know what was happening is close to infinitesimal.""
The US had only sanctioned a single Myanmar commander and had scaled back already-limited bilateral military ties before Friday's announcement.

In Thursday’s statement, posted online, Facebook said it was using tools to automatically detect hate speech and hiring more Burmese-language speakers to review posts, following up on a pledge made by founder Mark Zuckerberg to US senators in April.
""The ethnic violence in Myanmar is horrific and we have been too slow to prevent misinformation and hate speech on Facebook,"" Facebook said.
The company said that it had more than 60 ""Myanmar language experts"" in June and plans to have at least 100 by the end of the year.
Facebook said it had banned a number of Myanmar hate figures and organisations from the platform.
The acknowledgement came after a Reuters investigation showed why the company has failed to stem a wave of vitriolic posts about the mostly Muslim Rohingya minority.
Investigations revealed that Facebook had for years dedicated scant resources to combating hate speech in Myanmar, which is a market it dominates and where there have been repeated eruptions of ethnic violence.
In early 2015, for instance, there were only two people at Facebook who could speak Burmese monitoring problematic posts.
More than 1,000 examples of posts, comments, images and videos denigrating and attacking the Rohingya and other Muslims were on the social media platform as of last week.
Some of the material, which included pornographic anti-Muslim images, has been up on Facebook for as long as six years.
There are numerous posts that call the Rohingya and other Muslims dogs and rapists, and urge they be exterminated.
Researchers and human rights activists say they have been warning Facebook for years about how its platform was being used to spread hatred against the Rohingya and other Muslims in Myanmar.
Some 700,000 Rohingya fled their homes last year after an army crackdown that the US denounced as ethnic cleansing.
The Rohingya now live in teeming refugee camps in Bangladesh.

Omar, who drew national attention just two years ago by becoming the first Somali American elected to a state legislature in Minnesota, led a field that included former state House Speaker Margaret Anderson Kelliher.
If Omar wins in November in the reliably liberal district, she would be the first Somali American elected to Congress.
""Tonight, we are celebrating because we engaged and empowered our community and we won,"" Omar said in a statement.
""Our campaign staff, our volunteers, and the people of the Fifth Congressional District are the inspiration we need to get up every day and fight for a democracy that guarantees a more just and equitable society.""
Representative Keith Ellison left the seat to run for state attorney general, winning his primary Tuesday night for that job.
Omar and Rashida Tlaib - a Palestinian American who won a Detroit-area Democratic primary in Michigan last week and is running unopposed in November - are now positioned to become the first two Muslim women to serve in Congress.
Tlaib wrote on Twitter: ""I can't wait to walk onto the floor of United States Congress hand in hand with you. So incredibly proud of you.""

Omar was first elected into office in 2016 by unseating a 22-term Democratic incumbent.
With a slight record after a single term in the minority party, Omar touted her background to voters, saying she would fight against US President Donald Trump, noting she would have been affected by his proposal to restrict travel from Muslim-majority countries.
The 2018 midterm elections have seen a record number of Muslims - at least 90 - running for political office.

""Freedom, freedom!"" demonstrators chanted as they marched on Wednesday, some carrying signs that read ""justice and freedom"" for those arrested.
According to the Civic Alliance, an organisation representing the protesters, about 400 people who have been arrested since the protests began in Nicaragua in mid-April remain in detention. Nearly 140 have been charged with crimes, including terrorism and organised crime, the organisation said.

Anti-government protests began on April 18 after a now-scrapped pension reform proposal was introduced.
The protests have since mushroomed into a broad campaign against Ortega and his wife, Vice President Rosario Murillo.
Protesters accuse Ortega's government of using heavy-handed tactics to curb the demonstrations, including arbitrarily arresting thousands of people.
According to the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR), 317 people have been killed by police and groups loyal to Ortega. The government puts the death toll at 197, including 22 police officers.
Ortega, whose supporters have also taken to the streets in recent months, has denied allegations that he controls the pro-government paramilitaries that rights groups claim work with police. He accused Nicaraguan political groups of heading rival anti-government groups.
In a recent interview with Fox News, the president accused those groups of killing ""tens"" of police officers, adding that ""none of the peaceful demonstrators"" has been attacked by police.
Ortega said he will serve out his term until 2021, maintaining that moving up the elections - a demand of the protesters - would ""make things worse"".
The Organization of American States (OAS) has called on Ortega's government to ""put an end to the violence and to and to initiate once and for all the forms of dialogue that would pave the road to peace and the respect of human rights.""
Some 23,000 of Nicaraguans have sought refugee protection in neighbouring Costa Rica as a result of the violence.

On Tuesday, Madrid said it would accept 60 people, while Portugal offered to welcome 30, with the remainder distributed between France, Germany and Luxembourg, government sources in Malta and Spain said.
The boat was initially refused entry by Italy and Malta after it had rescued the refugees and migrants in two separate missions off the Libyan coast on Friday.
There are 67 unaccompanied minors, two children under the age of five and two pregnant women on board, its crew reported.
The Aquarius, which hit the headlines in June after being stranded with 630 migrants on board, causing a major diplomatic dispute, resumed its rescue operations off Libya last week.
Spain's new socialist government helped resolve the first standoff by allowing the boat to dock in Valencia and was again at the forefront on Tuesday.
""Spain has coordinated a pioneering agreement with six countries to share the hosting of the people on the Aquarius ... Spain will take 60 people,"" Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez wrote on Twitter.
Translation: Spain has coordinated a pioneering agreement with 6 countries to distribute the reception of #Aquarius people. It has been possible thanks to the path that we undertook in June, promoting a common and supportive response to the migratory flows. Spain will welcome 60 people.
España ha coordinado un acuerdo pionero con 6 países para distribuir la acogida de las personas del #Aquarius. Ha sido posible gracias al camino que emprendimos en junio, impulsando una salida común y solidaria a los flujos migratorios. España acogerá a 60 personas.
Malta later said it would allow the ship's passengers, including unaccompanied children from Somalia and repressive Eritrea, to disembark.
""Malta will be making a concession allowing the vessel to enter its ports, despite having no legal obligation to do so,"" said a government statement posted on Twitter.
Malta in a statement called the arrangement a ""concrete example of European leadership and solidarity.""
We will continue working with @sanchezcastejon on #migration and so many other issues, and thank him for his valuable collaboration on #Aquarius. #Malta and #Spain have common aims for #Europe and the #Mediterranean -JM
Its government also noted that it had rescued 114 migrants at sea on Monday - 60 of whom will also be distributed among other EU nations.
Dimitris Avramopoulos, the European commissioner for migration and home affairs, also commended the joint resolution.
Welcome the decision of Malta to authorise the disembarkation of the #Aquarius. I commend France Spain Germany Portugal and Luxembourg for their solidarity to take a share of the migrants on board. We need sustainable solutions. This is the responsibility of the EU as a whole.
Though departures from Libya have fallen dramatically this year, people smugglers are still pushing some boats out to sea.
An estimated 720 people died in June and July when charity ships were mainly absent, Amnesty International estimates. The UN International Organisation for Migration (IOM) has documented the deaths of 1,524 people while trying to enter Europe by sea in 2018.
EU border agency Frontex said on Monday it counted 73,500 ""irregular border crossings"" into the bloc so far this year via the sea and the Western Balkans route, more than 40 percent fewer than in the first seven months of 2017.

The Aquarius, run by SOS Mediterranee and Doctors without Borders (MSF), picked up the people in two separate operations on Friday and is now in international waters between Italy and Malta.
On Monday, Italy's Transport Minister Danilo Toninelli urged the British government to ""assume its responsibility"" for the people on board, including dozens of unaccompanied minors.
""The boat is now in Maltese waters and has a Gibraltar flag. At this point, the United Kingdom should take responsibility for the safeguarding of the shipwrecked,"" Toninelli said on Twitter.
Malta said on Saturday it would not welcome the ship either.
""Malta was neither the coordinating nor the competent authority ... and therefore has no legal obligation to make the arrangements to provide for a place of safety,"" the government said in a statement.
Italian Interior Minister Matteo Salvini, who is also one of the country's two deputy prime ministers, also took to Twitter on Monday to say that the Aquarius ""can go wherever it wants, [but] not to Italy"".
The Aquarius, one of the last two NGO vessels still operating in the central Mediterranean. was the first charity ship to be turned away from Italian ports in early June, before being taken in by Spain.
On Monday, sources at the Spanish prime minister's office said that the country's ports were not the safest destination for the vessel, according to local media.
However, Jason Rizzo, MSF coordinator, told Al Jazeera that the organisation had not received any official statement by Spain.
""Our teams have seen the reports, but we have not received yet any formal response from Spain,"" he said on Monday.
In an online blog earlier in the day, MSF said its crew reported that the vessel was standing by at 60km from European shores, with 141 people, including 67 unaccompanied minors, two children under the age of five and two pregnant women.
And even though the different teams are calling for all European governments to help with this rescue, ""the preferred option is to receive a place that is much closer, so that the boat could disembark quickly"", and then aid could be provided to people that require humanitarian assistance, Rizzo explained.
Both the Maltese & Italian maritime authorities have informed us they will not grant the #Aquarius a place of safety to disembark the 141 rescued people onboard. #Aquarius has now reached a standby position exactly between Malta & Italy and awaits to be assigned a place of safety
Due to pressure from Italy and Malta, most charity ships are no longer patrolling off the coast of Libya.
Though departures from Libya have fallen dramatically this year, people smugglers are still pushing some boats out to sea.
An estimated 720 people died in June and July when charity ships were mainly absent, Amnesty International estimates.
Protracted feuds between European Union (EU) states over how to handle immigrants have thrown the issue back onto the European agenda.
EU border agency Frontex said on Monday it counted 73,500 ""irregular border crossings"" into the bloc so far this year via the sea and the Western Balkans route, more than 40 percent fewer than in the first seven months of 2017.

The 6.9-magnitude quake last Sunday injured more than 13,000 people, left more than 387,000 people displaced, and damaged thousands of buildings.
""It's predicted the death toll will continue to grow because there are still victims who are suspected of being buried by landslides and under rubble, and there are victims that have not been recorded and reported,"" national disaster agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said.
Most deaths occurred in the north of Lombok, where 334 people died and more than 200,000 people were forced out of damaged homes.
According to Sutopo, the emergency response period has been extended another 14 days.
""The main problem is the distribution of supplies to thousands of refugee points,"" he said. ""Most of the roads in north Lombok were damaged by the earthquake.""
Fears over continuing aftershocks persist in Lombok, with 450 having been registered since Sunday.
A humanitarian crisis is looming with hundreds of thousands left homeless and in desperate need of clean water, food, medicine and shelter.
According to scientists from NASA and the California Institute of Technology's rapid-imaging project, the earthquake lifted the island as much as 25 centimetres in some areas. In other places, the ground dropped five-15cm.
NASA said satellite observations can help authorities respond to earthquakes and other natural or man-made disasters.
Indonesia is prone to earthquakes because of its location in the Ring of Fire, an arc of volcanoes and fault lines in the Pacific Basin.
In December 2004, a magnitude-9.1 earthquake off Sumatra island triggered a massive tsunami that killed 230,000 people in a dozen countries across the Indian Ocean.

She made the comments on Saturday after being welcomed in Spain by Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez, in a visit taking place as a migrant-exchange deal between the two countries came into effect.
After their meeting, held in the Donana natural reserve in the southern region of Andalusia, the two leaders promoted a shared approach to immigration into the bloc amid increasing populist opposition in some countries to taking in more people seeking asylum.
They also said they will share a common vision at an EU summit in Austria next month.
""We are just a few kilometres from the African coast, similar to Malta or Sicily, so this is a challenge we must cope with together and no country can dodge this task,"" Merkel said at a press conference, renewing calls for a ""fair distribution"" of refugees and migrants across the bloc.
""The racist tendencies we are seeing, regrettably, in all member countries is something we have to fight against.""
Spain this year has become the main destination for refugees and migrants trying to reach Europe from Africa, amid a crackdown by Libyan authorities and a more hardline approach to immigration in Italy since the inauguration of its new government.
Last week, the UN's refugee agency, UNHCR, said 23,500 people had arrived in Spain by sea, compared to about 18,500 in Italy and 16,000 in Greece.
""Fourteen kilometres separate the coast of Spain - and therefore Europe - from those of North Africa but there is an infinitely greater distance in terms of development,"" Sanchez told reporters.
""Reducing the depth of this abyss of inequality must be one of the main tasks of the European Union.""
Merkel and Sanchez have agreed to push for greater help from the EU for countries such as Morocco, one of the main points of departure for people wanting to reach Europe.
Sanchez said the two leaders were in discussion with the European Commission to unlock aid that would allow Morocco to be more effective in controlling their borders.
""We have to intensify our support for Morocco and Tunisia,"" Merkel said. ""They are border countries and they need our help.""
The two leaders met on the same day that a bilateral deal on immigration between the countries came into effect.
Under the deal, Madrid agreed to take back migrants arriving in Germany after registering in Spain.
Spain is the first EU country to sign such an agreement, while Merkel is seeking similar arrangements with Greece and Italy after recently coming under severe pressure from her interior minister Horst Seehofer.
In June, a dispute over immigration between Seehofer and Merkel nearly brought an end to the chancellor's 13-year-long rule.
Seehofer wanted to start turning away migrants at the German border who had already registered elsewhere in the EU - a policy Merkel had explicitly disagreed with.
The hardened stances on immigration in a number of European countries comes amid a significant downturn of migrants and refugees arriving on the continent.
By the end of July, 62,459 people had arrived by sea and land according to UNHCR figures. In 2015, more than 225,000 people arrived in the same period.

The move is intended to help establish the infrastructure to support the new arrivals, who do not have humanitarian refugee status in Ecuador, as they do in some other Latin American countries.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Human Mobility said in a statement on Wednesday that in recent days, the number of Venezuelans arriving daily had risen to 4,200 and a contingency plan is needed to assist them.
Santiago Chavez, the vice minister of human mobility, said the plan would ""give an effective and forceful response in benefit of the preservation of those entering Ecuadorian territory"".
As part of the contingency plan, extra immigration officials will be hired and more doctors, social workers and psychologists will be sent to the Carchi, Pinchincha and El Oro provinces along Ecuador's border with Colombia, to assist sick and vulnerable migrants.
International aid organisations will also assist in the efforts by providing tents, water and food.
This is the first time a state of emergency has been declared in these provinces. It will stay in place until at least the end of August.
A number of Latin American countries are introducing special measures to cope with migration from Venezuela, which is led by President Nicolas Maduro and is suffering from ongoing political, social and economic crises.
In August, former Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos, granted 440,000 Venezuelan refugees temporary residency permits, which allow them to study, work and get medical care in Colombia.
Brazil declared a state of emergency in May and briefly closed its northern border with Venezuela on Tuesday.
Argentina has taken in some 31,167 Venezuelans under a law that allows foreign nationals to remain in the country ""when there are exceptional reasons of a humanitarian nature"".
Meanwhile, Venezuela's pro-Maduro Constituent Assembly revoked the immunity of opposition lawmakers Julio Borges and Juan Requesens for allegedly masterminding what the president called an assassination attempt against him.
Requesens was seized by intelligence officers overnight, while Venezuela's Supreme Court ordered Borges' arrest.
Maduro said in a broadcast that Borges was living in neighbouring Colombia.
A drone loaded with explosives on Saturday detonated near a military event where Maduro was giving a speech. The president escaped unharmed but seven people were wounded.
Attorney General Tarek William Saab said moves were being made to put Requesens on trial, while Maduro is pressing Colombia and the US to extradite opposition figures, including Borges.
Borges, who on Tuesday attended the swearing-in of Colombia's new president, Ivan Duque, called Maduro's accusation against him ""a farce.""
Translation: Nicolas Maduro you have accused me of the economic war, of the cash crisis, of the hyperinflation, of the generalised scarcity.. And now of the farce of the attack? You do not cheat anyone. You are the only one to blame for the tragedy of the country, Borges wrote in Twitter.

These events came as Venezuela's economy continues to struggle, the International Monetary Fund projects inflation could top 1 million percent this year.
The currency has fallen 99.99 percent against the US dollar on the black market since Maduro came to power in April 2013.
Many Venezuelans are choosing to leave their country as the recession is now entering its fifth year.
Maduro blames the crisis on an economic war led by opposition leaders with the help of Washington, which last year levied several rounds of sanctions against his administration.

The court appearance on Thursday followed events in which Biti fled to Zambia, was denied asylum and was handed over to Zimbabwean security forces in defiance of a Zambian court order.
Police in Zimbabwe were looking for Biti and eight other opposition figures for allegedly fomenting violence following the July 30 vote in which President Emmerson Mnangagwa was declared the winner amid opposition cries of foul play.
They and several others were accused of ""possession of dangerous weapons"" and ""subversive material"", as well as ""public violence,"" according to a copy of the warrant.
If found guilty, Biti faces up to 10 years in jail, a cash fine or both.
State prosecutors did not oppose bail, which was set at $5,000. Biti was ordered to surrender title deeds to his house and his passport, and has been banned from addressing political rallies or news conferences until the case is over. He is scheduled to appear in court again on Friday.
Speaking in court to lawyers and the media. Biti said: ""They wanted to abduct me (on Wednesday), I was terrified.""
Soon after his release, he told reporters: ""It's been an ordeal, but we survive. We live to fight another day, I am glad to be home.""
Mnangagwa later said he had intervened for Biti's release because ""nothing is more important than unity and peace"".
STATEMENT ON RELEASE OF TENDAI BITI Tendai Biti was released earlier today following my intervention. At such a crucial time in the history of the new Zimbabwe, nothing is more important than unity, peace and dialogue. (1/3)
But he highlighted that no one is above the law, ""thus to the serious nature of allegations of incitement, due process will continue,"" he wrote.
The United Nations refugee agency said it was ""gravely concerned"" about the reports of Biti's forced return to Zimbabwe, calling such move a serious violation of international law.
A joint statement by the heads of missions in Zimbabwe of the European Union, the United States, Canada and Australia urgently called on Zimbabwean authorities to guarantee Biti's safety and respect his rights.
It said diplomats were ""deeply disturbed"" by reports of security forces targeting the opposition.
The persecution of leaders Tendai Biti, Komichi, Chidziva & other party officials by the state is unjustified & unacceptable.I raised this matter with President Cyril Ramaphosa whom we count on to persuade the perpetrators to halt this unmerited persecution. The weak terrorize!
The polls were the first without longtime President Robert Mugabe on the ballot form, who was forced to resign in November after a military intervention.
Biti, a newly elected member of parliament for the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), last week urged opposition supporters to defend their votes in the disputed ballot, saying MDC candidate Nelson Chamisa had won the presidential race.
The day after Biti's remarks, the military opened fire to disperse opposition protesters in the streets of Harare.
The opposition alliance called the state's response ""disproportionate and unjustified"".

Instead, she is forced to live with the horror and shame every time she recalls what happened.
Fatima, whose real name was changed to protect her privacy, is a widow and mother of five girls. She fled her village of Merula, in Myanmar's Rakhine state, as a government-backed attack on the minority Rohingya population escalated, in what the United Nations described as ""textbook ethnic cleansing"".
Fatima's daughters crossed into Bangladesh before her, as it is the custom for Rohingya women to send their children ahead with the village men making their way to the border. As the violence spiralled into chaos, she decided to leave.
In August last year, she reached Daungkhali Char, an island in Myanmar across the Naf River from Bangladesh, before her luck ran out.
She said two Myanmar soldiers dragged her away to a field and for the next two days raped her repeatedly, sometimes to the point where she lost consciousness.
""I don't know how many times they violated my body,"" Fatima said in a voice barely above a murmur.
When the soldiers decided to move on, she crossed the Naf River into Bangladesh, numb to the bone and dazed out of her mind.
""I was unaware of my senses for a while,"" she said. ""I found out five months later I was pregnant. I tried to have an abortion by swallowing pills, but that didn't work.""
She looked down at the baby nestled in the crook of her arm. ""I didn't tell anyone he was conceived through rape.""
Four-month-old Bilal fussed and started wailing. Distractedly, Fatima rubbed his back in circular motions until he fell quiet again.
Shunned and brokenhearted
Fatima now lives with four of her daughters in Balukhali camp, part of the severely overcrowded Kutapalong camp that now houses more than 600,000 refugees. She spends her days under her dim tarp-and-bamboo shelter, afraid of being judged if she ventures outside, even if it is to get provisions handed out by humanitarian organisations.
She relies instead on the kindness of her neighbour Shamim who, along with his wife, know her secret and deliver aid provisions to her shelter.
Refugees living in the same section of the camp are mostly from other villages and don't know her backstory, such as the fact her husband died five years ago from illness.
""Many assume that my husband was killed by the Myanmar army while I was pregnant with Bilal,"" Fatima said. ""But those who know me shun me, which causes me so much grief.""
Her voice breaks and rises to choke back a sob.
""My eldest daughter is married and lives in another camp, and her husband forbade her from visiting me,"" she said, her eyes bright with tears. ""I haven't seen her for almost a year.""
She delivered Bilal at a hospital clinic run by Doctors Without Borders (MSF). No questions were asked about how the baby was conceived, and Fatima remained silent, too ashamed to offer the truth.
""After I gave birth, MSF gave me a pair of sandals, a headscarf, and baby food,"" she said. ""I have to visit the clinic once a week to get tablets that help me develop breast milk.""
She hasn't received any kind of psychological help and, fearing social stigmatisation, admits she won't be able to tell the truth about Bilal at counselling centres and women-friendly spaces set up in the camp, much less to her new neighbours.
The idea frightens her to the point where she starts crying again.
A Rohingya community leader in Fatima's camp, Abdulmunam, is familiar with her story and said it is his job to know the needs of the 84 families in the block. Yet he acknowledged the reaction to breaking down socially ingrained concepts, and said openly speaking about sexual violence would result in a backlash and be counterintuitive.
""Everyone here should assist and support each other as much as possible, given our helpless situation,"" he said.
""But our community regards rape survivors as a disgrace so it's easier for me to tell some NGOs and aid agencies, instead of fellow refugees, about Fatima's case in order to help her out and send her provisions.""
Johara Khatun, 50, is known in the neighbouring Kutapalong camp as one of the best midwives, but in the 10 months since she fled Rakhine she has not come across any women who told her they were raped.
""Rape is the worst kind of torture for women, especially if it results in conception,"" she said.
""But they should keep quiet and not talk about what happened to them, otherwise people would regard them as tarnished, and cut off their ties with them. In the case of unmarried girls, no one would look at them or consider them for marriage.""
Johara said she doesn't think abortion is the solution but concedes that it could be ""maybe only"" in the early stages of pregnancy.
""It is better to have the baby and if the women still don't want to take care of it they can give the baby to families who want children,"" she said.
Tayabur Rahman Chowdhury, head of UNHCR's health units in Kutapalong camp, said the refugee agency has recruited community health volunteers from the refugees themselves in a bid to break down these social attitudes.
""We try to take big initiatives whenever we hear that social stigma has begun to take root against an unmarried girl or mother,"" he said, sitting in his office near the entrance of the camp.
""We confront the community and ask, 'how is this their fault? What would you do in her position?' She was forced, she was raped, and it's not her fault.""
Attitudes towards sexual violence victims have not dramatically changed to absolve the victims of any blame, but Chowdhury said these things take time and more awareness-building.
Aid agencies, which have treated hundreds of Rohingya women subjected to gender-based violence in Rakhine state since August 2017, say estimates of the number of raped women are greatly understated because reluctance and shame prevent them from coming forward.
In a report published in March, MSF said it had treated 113 survivors of sexual violence since August 25 last year, ranging in age from nine to 50 years old.
Based on testimonies, the organisation said Myanmar soldiers deliberately used rape and other forms of sexual violence against women and girls as part of a widespread attack against the Rohingya population.
In April, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres placed Myanmar's army on a watchlist report of security forces and armed groups ""credibly suspected"" of using rape and sexual violence in conflict.
""The widespread threat and use of sexual violence was integral to this strategy, serving to humiliate, terrorise and collectively punish the Rohingya community as a calculated tool to force them to flee their homelands and prevent their return,"" Guterres said.
Chowdhury said since last October, a handful of women have come to his health centre in Kutapalong camp saying they had been raped.
""Some of them arrived at the centre after they missed their periods and told me what Myanmar soldiers and Rakhine vigilantes did to them,"" he said. ""Two other women came to me to get abortions, which the centre provides.""
He explained that for official records, it was difficult to document physical evidence of rape after the first 72 hours as abrasions, cuts, and bruises usually go away after that time.
""For unmarried girls, hymens are no marker of whether rape occurred or not because not all women have hymens,"" he said.
""This leaves us with the option of asking rape survivors to keep the clothes they were wearing during the incident unwashed, and to not clean their bodies until they reach the health centre so we can run tests.""
But that is also not realistic, he said, as the women inevitably wash after days of travelling on foot crossing the border.
For those shouldering the secret of birthing a child conceived by rape, dealing with the trauma and the aftermath is dependent on support from family members.
For Fatima, she has come to love her baby - as have her daughters living with her - and said she would not give him away.
""I don't even know which one of the soldiers that raped me is the father of Bilal,"" she said. ""But he is my child, and my only son.""

A Supreme Court justice overturned on Monday a federal court's decision hours earlier to suspend the entry of more migrants until those already residing in the northernmost state of Roraima were transferred elsewhere in Brazil.
The border had remained open to Brazilians and other nationalities, as well as Venezuelans returning home.
""It is not justified to take the easy path to 'close the doors' because of difficulties in hosting refugees,"" Supreme Court Judge Rosa Weber said in her ruling.
""Although most of those who cross the border ... do not fit into the legal definition of refugee or asylum, closing the border between the two countries could impact the situation of individuals who can qualify for protections under international law,"" she added.
About 800 Venezuelans arrive in Brazil every day, while more than 70,000 crossed the border during the past year, according to government estimates.
Venezuela is suffering from an economic collapse, causing chronic shortages of basic supplies.
An apparent assassination attempt on deeply unpopular President Nicolas Maduro last week has further exacerbated tensions in the country.
About 40,000 Venezuelan migrants have settled in Boa Vista, the capital of Roraima state - accounting for nearly 20 percent of the city's population - according to non-governmental international SOS Children's Villages.
Suely Campos, the state's governor, praised the initial ruling to shut the border.
""We have been asking the federal Supreme Court since May to close the border, as well as for financial assistance to minimise the impact on our public services,"" she said in a statement.
In February, Brazil declared a state of emergency in Roraima that led to a funding boost for the state and doubled the number of troops stationed at the border with Venezuela.
Rights groups expressed concern over Monday's decision, however, arguing it contradicted Brazil's responsibility towards people seeking sanctuary.
""Seeking asylum is a right and states must fulfill their shared responsibility to protect refugees,"" Erika Guevara-Rosas, Amnesty International's Americas director, said in a tweet.

A 68-page report by the New York-based group highlighted the dangers the Rohingya face from flooding and landslides during the monsoon season as they wait to return to their homeland in Myanmar, as well as the heightened risks of communicable diseases, fires, community tensions, and domestic and sexual violence to which the densely packed refugees are subjected.
These refugees ""should have sturdier shelters and adequate education for their extended stay"", said the report titled, Bangladesh Is Not My Country: The Plight of Rohingya Refugees from Myanmar.
It called on Bangladeshi authorities to transfer the Rohingya to smaller, less-congested camps on flatter, proximate land in the same Ukhiya sub-district where the mega camp is located.
Since August last year, more than 700,000 Rohingya have fled across the border from Rakhine State in Myanmar, after the army waged a brutal crackdown against the Muslim minority.
An estimated 626,000 Rohingya - from last year's and past displacements - are now living in the Kutapalong-Balukhali camp, making it the largest refugee camp in the world.
It is severely overcrowded, the report said, with the average usable space at 10.7sq metres a person, far below the recommended international standard of 45sq metres for each individual.
The UN's refugee agency estimates 200,000 Rohingya are at risk of floods and landslides.
Mohammad Abul Kalam, the Refugee Relief and Repatriation Commissioner for Bangladesh's disaster management ministry, told Al Jazeera there is ""no doubt"" the camp is ""definitely overcrowded"".
""But we also don't have much mainland,"" he said. ""We are a population of 160 million and suffer from land scarcity. So, settling the refugees in the first place is really remarkable.""
The Bangladesh government said it would soon start relocating 100,000 Rohingya to Bhasan Char, an uninhabited mangrove-and-grass island. However, HRW said it was not fit for accommodation because of its vulnerability to high waves and tides, and in the event of a cyclone, it would be completely submerged under water.
""We are very concerned for the plan of relocating Rohingya refugees to Bhasan Char,"" Nay San Lwin, a coordinator of Free Rohingya Coalition based in London, told Al Jazeera.
""The refugees in the camps are also not willing to move to Bhasan Char. They would be more comfortable if they were relocated within Ukhiya with easy access to aid agencies.""
According to HRW's report, there are six practical relocation sites in Ukhiya - in an eight-kilometre stretch west of the Kutupalong-Balukhali camp - that could accommodate 263,000 people.
Yet Abul Kalam said the government is ""serious"" about relocating refugees to Bhasan Char as ""they have invested a lot of money in this"".
In addition to relocation, the report said the Rohingya, particularly the recent arrivals over the past year, have a right to a dignified life.
""Bangladesh should register fleeing Rohingya as refugees, ensure adequate healthcare and education, and let them pursue livelihoods outside the camp,"" said Bill Frelick, refugee rights director at Human Rights Watch.
Nay San Lwin agreed.
""Granting them refugee status will help a lot in improving the conditions of the camps and lives of refugees,"" he said.
Tarek Mahmud, a local journalist who spent more than 100 days at Cox's Bazar covering the refugee crisis, said authorities need to better organise healthcare and proper education for Rohingya children.
""But in the case of pursuing work outside the camps, that carries the risk of tensions spilling into conflicts between the locals and Rohingya,"" he told Al Jazeera.
Instead, Mahmud said it would be better to organise skills training and work opportunities in the camps, which would ""benefit the Rohingya when they go back to their villages in Rakhine"".
While Frelick recognised Bangladesh's ""rightfully garnered international praise"" for shouldering the burden of the Rohingya plight, ultimately it is Myanmar that is responsible for the crisis, he said.
Frelick called on international organisations and governments to apply persistent pressure on Myanmar in order to meet the required conditions for safe, dignified, and sustainable returns of the Rohingya refugees.
""Myanmar's failure to take any meaningful actions to address recent atrocities against the Rohingya, or the decades-long discrimination and repression against the population, is at the root of delays in refugees being able to go home,"" he said.

The proposal, which came in the form of a letter addressed to the senior US military general in July, referenced an informal refugee camp in Rukban, the ministry said in a statement on Saturday.
The poorly equipped camp, home to at least 55,000 Syrians, is located in a desert area near the convergence of the Iraqi, Syrian and Jordanian borders.
In the letter, the Russian chief of staff, General Valery Gerasimov, said Moscow was ready to discuss with Damascus safety guarantees for refugees stranded at Rukban, as well as creating conditions for their return home.
""A proposal was also made to coordinate humanitarian de-mining, including in Raqqa, and other priority humanitarian issues for the urgent establishment of peaceful life in Syria,"" the ministry said.
The proposal illustrates how Russia, having helped turn the tide of the war in favour of President Bashar al-Assad, is now pressing Washington and others to aid the reconstruction of areas under his control.
""The proposal argues that the Syrian regime lacks the equipment, fuel, other material, and funding needed to rebuild the country in order to accept refugee returns,"" according to a US government memo, which was seen by Reuters news agency.
The Russian plan received an icy reception in Washington. The memo said the US policy was only to support such efforts if there was a political solution to end Syria's seven-year-old civil war.
Rukban lies within 55km of the so-called de-confliction zone established by the US close to the Iraqi-Syrian border.
The American presence in Syria has been limited to the north, where the US-backed Kurdish Syrian Democratic Forces are in control. The US is also present in the south along the Jordanian border.
Addressing the United Nations Security Council last week, Russia urged world powers to help Syria's economic recovery and the return of refugees as its Damascus ally presses on with a campaign to re-take rebel-held territory.
Moscow's intervention in 2015 tilted the conflict for Assad's forces, who have in recent months made major territorial gains against armed groups, including the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL, also known as ISIS).
Since then, Russia has mainly conducted air strikes against groups opposed to the government, including the Syrian National Coalition, ISIL, Hay'et Tahrir al-Sham - previously known as al-Nusra Front - and others.
The war, now in its seventh year, has killed hundreds of thousands of people and created the world's worst refugee crisis, driving more than 11 million people from their homes.

As part of the initiative, the Republican president along with his son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner, have been trying to disrupt the UN agency for Palestinians, UNRWA, Foreign Policy (FP) magazine revealed in an article published on Friday.
In a controversial move in January, the US government announced that it was withholding $65m of a planned $125m funding instalment to the relief agency, after Trump accused the Palestinians of being ungrateful for the millions of dollars in aid.
Prior to the announcement, Kushner, in a leaked email obtained by FP, wrote: ""It is important to have an honest and sincere effort to disrupt UNRWA.""
""This [agency] perpetuates a status quo, is corrupt, inefficient and doesn't help peace,"" he reportedly wrote in an email dated January 11 and addressed to several senior US officials.
Palestinian officials told FP that Kushner - tasked with reviving the stalled Israeli-Palestinian peace process - allegedly pressed Jordan to strip more than two million Palestinians of their refugee status, so the UNRWA would no longer have to operate there.
The White House declined to comment on the record for FP's story.
The report also mentioned two bills in the US Congress that try to redirect more funding away from UNRWA, and significantly reduce the number of Palestinian refugees eligible for US aid.
Those steps are all reportedly part of Kushner's so-called ""deal of the century"" to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
In a statement to Al Jazeera, UNRWA, said: ""We cannot comment on the so-called 'deal of the century' as we do not know definitively any details about it.
""The [UN] General Assembly has mandated us to continue delivering services until there is a just and durable solution to the conflict and we are determined to do that to the best of our ability,"" it added.
In June, the UN called on member states to fill the critical funding gap caused by the US government's aid cut.
According to UN officials, the US - previously UNRWA's top donor - provided $364m to the agency last year, but only $60m this year.
Jordan's Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi weighed in on the agency's financial challenges on Saturday, saying: ""Maintaining UNRWA services is a moral, legal duty towards refugees [that the] international community must uphold.""
""Refugees is the final status issue,"" he said on Twitter. ""It must be resolved on the basis of UN resolutions, the Arab Peace Initiative, meeting right to return and compensation.""
Pierre Krahenbuhl, UNRWA's commissioner-general, has said that the cuts made by the Trump administration are endangering basic services, including food assistance in the besieged Gaza Strip, as well as medical clinics and education services to about half a million children.
According to Nabil Sha'ath, senior adviser to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, efforts are now being made to get alternative funding.
""We have already started a campaign to finance UNRWA from other sources,"" he told Al Jazeera in an interview from Ramallah. ""We have now more support coming from Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and other Gulf countries - also from Japan, Belgium, Luxembourg and other countries.
""We cannot really depend on this US administration, not have any credibility of the statements that come out of it.""
Commenting on the Kushner-led US efforts in the region, Sha'ath said: ""There is no ... deal of the century - a deal is something that two parties agree to, offering something and getting something.
""There is simply a total support of the right-wing government of Israel, the Zionist plan for settlements and the total destruction of the peace process that was signed in the US in 1993,"" he added.
""Really, it will lead to nothing but greater disruption of this part of the world rather than seeking any solution.""

""There is no work here and nothing to do,"" he says, recounting his monotonous routine.
""I wake up at dawn to pray, I read Quran, I take naps, I wait for the aid agencies to come,"" adds al-Amin, who is in his mid-40s.
""That's daily life.""
Al-Amin is one of the 4,600 displaced Rohingya stranded in bleak conditions at a camp in no-man's land on the Myanmar-Bangladesh border, known to locals as Zero Point.
The camp's residents have not been given refugee status, as the area in which they have been sheltering for almost a year now is officially under Myanmar control - but a fortified border fence rigged with landmines makes a return to their villages in Rakhine state an impossible mission.
On the other side of the canal, a mere few metres, is the Tambru Konapara, which lies in Bangladeshi territory.
Twice a month, a team by the International Committee for the Red Cross arrives here with provisions for the displaced Rohingya.
Under the watchful eye of the Bangladesh Border Guards (BGB), the Rohingya are allowed to cross a newly-built wooden bridge into Tambru checkpoint to pick up the aid items, as well as carry out their frugal shopping at Tambru village.
The BGB and these Rohingya have a mutual understanding, a gentlemen's agreement of some sorts, that the latter will always return to the camp on the other side.
Lieutenant Colonel Monzural Hassan Khan, the local commanding BGB officer, says it is simply a ""matter of convenience"" to let the Rohingya from no-man's land to enter Bangladeshi territory.
""If they can't come to this side, then how can they collect their rations from the international community?"" he says.
""Although they are Myanmar nationals, they move around inside our land but don't go far.""
For al-Amin, who used to own paddy fields in his village of Panipara in Muangdaw township in Myanmar, this is the third time he's experienced displacement.
The first was in 1978, when he was still a child and had to spent a year at a refugee camp in Bangladesh after escaping anti-Rohingya violence by Myanmar's authorities. Then in 1992, he was forced to flee for a second time and ended up living as a refugee for eight years.
And the third was last year, on August 27, when he and his family fled a Myanmar army crackdown in Rakhine state, which the UN said amounted to ethnic cleansing - an accusation Myanmar denies.
The mass exodus came after the military launched a ferocious counteroffensive following attacks on police and army posts by Arakan Rohingya Solidarity Army (ARSA), a small group of men fighting in Myanmar's western region of Rakhine.
To date, more than 700,000 Rohingya - a majority-Muslim ethnic group often described as ""the world's most persecuted minority"" - have been displaced and now populate several refugee camps in Bangladesh's Cox's Bazar.
""Two of my sons were injured by mine blasts, one in the head and the other in the chest,"" al-Amin says. ""They are now doing better, after a long treatment at the local Bangladeshi hospital on the other side.""
Acknowledging that his sons were lucky not to lose their limbs or, even worse, their lives, he recalls witnessing a 45-year-old woman losing both of her legs to the mines, which were placed in holes in the fence.
""How many more days will I spend here this time?"" he asks, voicing his frustration and concern regarding the future of his children, the eldest of whom is 21 and the youngest is seven.
""Will they live the rest of their lives as refugees?""
Life in the camp is grim. There are no facilities, no jobs and no schools.
The rudimentary housing structures have now been built over stilts in a bid to avoid flooding, which hit the camp during the monsoon season last year.
Dil Muhammad, the Rohingya camp leader, points to the bridge: a simple, latticed structure that is painted green and supported by bamboo poles.
""This was built by us one month ago, on July 1,"" he says. ""The BGB turned a blind eye even though the construction materials came from them. We used to have to wade through the canal to collect aid.""
The 51-year-old father of six said his village lies only seven kilometres from the Myanmar border fence. He says he has faced continuous unfounded accusations from Myanmar authorities that he is a senior member of ARSA.
""When the UN Special Envoy to Myanmar Christine Schraner Burgener came a few months ago from the border fence here to talk to me, the Myanmar government district sought to discredit what I had to say by calling me an ARSA leader,"" he says.
According to other residents, it is not the first time Myanmar has said ARSA members live in the camp.
""Myanmar soldiers often attempt to provoke the younger men and boys to throw rocks at them by firing blank shots and throwing bottles at us during the night,"" al-Amin says.
Muhammad sighs. He says no one wants to live under such dire conditions.
""When we first arrived, we thought that after a few days we would return back to our homeland,"" he says. ""One year has passed, and there has been no solution. The UN has failed us.""
Across the bridge, the Tambru border village in the Bangladeshi Bandarban district is home to about 6,000 people.
Its main road is lined with shops, tea stalls and vegetable stands. Some of the Rohingya from the camp in no-man's land stand on the side of the road, while others move around with more familiarity.
""We are not disturbed by their presence,"" says Nur Muhammad, owner of the Simanto Hotel and Restaurant in the village, adding that the mostly rural area had not witnessed any trouble from the newcomers.
""We are on the same side. We also face no troubles with the Myanmar authorities on the border.""
He regards the Rohingya that used to live in border towns in Myanmar as braver than the rest of the population because of their frequent experiences with violence due to their location.
One thing that locals are worried about in the short term, Muhammad says, is the daily cost of labour; a Bangladeshi worker will work for 500 taka ($6), but a Rohingya worker will work for less, 200/300 taka ($2.4/$3.5).
""Long-run assimilation would be a cause for tension because of the country's over-population,"" Muhammad says.
""We will still accept them though.""

Santos, who leaves office on Tuesday, granted the refugees two-year temporary residency permits, allowing them to study, work and get medical care that many need after arriving with untreated ailments.
""The whole world is increasingly terrified of what is happening in Venezuela,"" Santos said speaking from the presidential palace in the capital, Bogota, on Thursday.
Venezuelans struggle to afford scarce food and medicine under soaring inflation - driving masses across borders.
Santos condemned Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro for the crisis, in a statement that comes amid a tense political situation between Colombia and Venezuela
The Colombian president said that more than one million Venezuelans have fled into Colombia in the last 18 months.
Translation: I reiterate my condemnation of the Venezuelan regime. A regime that does not listen and that remains in a state of total denial. I insist on allowing a humanitarian channel to relieve the suffering of its people, President Santos wrote on Twitter.
Reitero mi condena al régimen venezolano. Un régimen que no escucha y que se mantiene en estado de negación total. Insisto en que permita un canal humanitario para que alivie en algo el sufrimiento de su pueblo. pic.twitter.com/2bEfmYDpDL
While critical of Maduro, Santos said his country is willing to help those suffering.
""They are Colombians returning to the country,"" Santos said. ""They are Venezuelans. They are Colombian-Venezuelan families, and they're returning in precarious conditions.""
Separately, as the crisis in Venezuela - whose economy enters its fifth year of recession - deepens, the country's Constituent Assembly voted to legalise money exchange operations on Thursday, with the aim of relaxing the strict currency controls imposed by the government.
The measure's reach was not immediately clear but the pro-government assembly agreed to revoke the law that criminalises money exchange and eliminate an article from the law governing the Venezuelan Central Bank to allow the sale and purchase of foreign currency.
Tareck El Aissami, the vice president for the economy, said Venezuelans would be able to go to state-authorised exchange houses to exchange money in a ""transparent, legal and safe manner"".
""This is a big opportunity. It is a fresh start,"" said El Aissami in a speech at the pro-government assembly to propose the reform. He did not provide details on how an exchange rate would be determined.
The government currently fixes sales of dollars at an official rate of 172,800 bolivars per US dollar, well below the black market rate of around 3.6m bolivars per US dollar.
Venezuela's bolivar currency has fallen 99.99 percent against the US dollar on the black market since Maduro came to power in April 2013.
A $100 purchase of bolivars then would now be worth just less than a single US cent.
Maduro blames the crisis on an economic war led by opposition leaders with the help of Washington, which last year levied several rounds of sanctions against his administration.

William Spindler, UNHCR spokesman, told reporters in Geneva on Tuesday that an average of 200 asylum applications are being lodged every day in Costa Rica.
""Besides the 8,000 who have filed asylum claims, and the 15,000 who are waiting to do so, thousands more have arrived in Costa Rica but have not yet contacted authorities there,"" added Splinter.
Panama, Mexico and the United States also saw a rise in claims by Nicaraguans in the first half of this year, but the numbers in these countries are still in the low hundreds, according to the UNHCR.
Spindler urged the international community to support Costa Rica and other host countries ""in the spirit of solidarity and responsibility-sharing"".
We are stepping up our response as thousands flee violence in Nicaragua https://t.co/Hlkkvv7u4o
Nicaragua's unrest began on April 18 with protests against a pension reform plan, which has since been dropped. But violent repression has led opposition anger to mushroom into a broad campaign against President Daniel Ortega and his wife, Vice President Rosario Murillo.
Protesters have demanded Ortega's resignation and early elections, but the embattled president has said he will not bring polls scheduled for 2021 forward.
On Monday, he also rejected the idea of calling a referendum on whether to hold an early election.
""The opposition has told me ... that I have to leave now, they have shouted at me that on April 19. I think it would be a very serious precedent for the good of the country,"" Ortega said in an interview with Euronews' Oscar Valero.
""To follow that path is to open the door to anarchy in the country. A broken Nicaragua would be taken over by drug trafficking,"" he added.
His comments came after the White House said on Monday it was revoking or restricting US visas of Nicaraguan officials connected to the violence against protesters.
""The United States strongly condemns the ongoing violence in Nicaragua and human rights abuses committed by the Ortega regime in response to protests,"" it said in a statement.
The White House described the Nicaraguan protests as demanding democratic reforms after years of fraudulent elections and repression of opposition parties and independent media.
But Ortega disagrees: ""The truth is we are facing a powerful enemy that has intervened militarily in Nicaragua, which is the United States,"" he told Euronews.

Nicaraguan human rights group CENIDH said 295 people have died in the violence, while other rights groups talk of up to 485 people killed.
Ortega said 195 people have died.
""Human rights organisations are politicised, have a systematic policy against the government and push people to file complaints. They invent anything,"" said Ortega.
Ortega, who ruled the country from 1979 to 1990, has held elected office as president since 2007.
The current violence comes after years of calm in Nicaragua and is the worst since his Sandinista movement battled US-backed ""Contra"" rebels in the 1980s.

The siege on Tuesday at the refugees and repatriations directorate compound, which began after a suicide bomber detonated explosives at the building's entrance, lasted for several hours, during which intermittent gunfire and blasts could be heard.
Spokesman Attaullah Khogyani, spokesman for the government of Nangarhar province, said the incident appeared to be over with two gunmen killed and much of the building destroyed.
He said at least 15 people had been killed and 15 wounded although the total may rise as rescue workers search the site. Sohrab Qaderi, a member of the local provincial council, said eight had been killed and as many as 30 wounded.
There was no immediate claim of responsibility.
""Around 11am local time, a car laden with explosives, drove up to this compound, two gunmen jumped out and then they set off the first of several explosions, then Afghan Special Forces arrived and a gun battle ensued for the following six hours,"" said Al Jazeera's Charlotte Bellis, reporting from Afghanistan's capital, Kabul.
She added that the targeted building is in a ""very sensitive area, with the United Nations compound next door and a large hospital on the other side"".
According to one witness, a passer-by named Obaidullah, the attack began when a black car with three occupants pulled up at the entrance to a building used by the department of refugee affairs, and a gunman got out firing around him.
One attacker blew himself up at the gate and two gunmen entered the building, which is in an area close to shops and government offices, Obaidullah told Reuters news agency.
Minutes later, the car exploded, wounding people in the street, he said.
""We saw several people wounded and helped to carry them away.""
Sohrab Qaderi, a member of the local provincial council, said around 40 people appeared to be caught inside the building, which caught fire in the initial stages of the attack.
One hostage had called the security services and told them that the attackers had ordered the people inside not to move, he said.
Khogyani said the attack happened during a meeting with NGOs working on refugee-related issues. The head of the directorate and several other people were taken to safety, he said.
The attack is the latest in a series of attacks that hit Jalalabad, the capital of Nangarhar province, in recent weeks, killing and wounding dozens of people.
On Saturday, a series of explosions went off in the city before attackers rushed a medical training centre for midwives. A gun battle that lasted for nearly six hours ensued, in which two people were killed.
On Monday, Nangarhar provincial health officials said that in the past three months at least 160 people have been killed and more than 490 wounded in attacks on the province.
Separately, a roadside bomb hit a Kabul-bound passenger bus in western Afghanistan on Tuesday, killing at least 11 people and wounding 37 others, including many women and children, officials said.
""The attack took place very early this morning, the bus with dozens of people on board drove over a roadside bomb,"" Bellis said.
""The government is blaming the attack on the Taliban,"" she added.
The wounded are being treated in a hospital in Herat province.
There was no immediate confirmation that the Taliban was responsible for the blast.The explosion took place as the bus travelled through Bala Baluk district of Farah at 4:30am (00:00 GMT), provincial governor spokesman Naser Mehri told AFP.
Photos posted on social media - purportedly of the bus - showed the vehicle's blackened shell and dozens of men standing at the scene.The Taliban has a heavy presence in Farah. It launched a major attempt to take over the provincial capital in May, triggering intense fighting with US and Afghan forces. After a day-long battle, Taliban fighters were forced to the outskirts of the city.
Civilians have borne the brunt of the 17-year conflict in Afghanistan. Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs), such as remotely detonated or pressure-plate bombs, are one of the main causes of casualties.Such IEDs caused 877 civilian casualties in the first half of 2018 - 232 deaths and 645 injuries - accounting for 17 percent of overall casualties.

Queensland state coroner Terry Ryan on Monday said the circumstances that led to Hamid Khazaei's death could be characterised as ""a series of clinical errors, compounded by failures in communication"" which led to delays in his care.
He also called on Canberra to improve healthcare for asylum seekers in offshore detention centres.
Hamid Khazaei died aged 24 on September 5, 2014, two weeks after contracting a leg infection while in detention at Papua New Guinea's (PNG) Manus Island prison.
Ryan's report found that no antibiotic was available at the Manus clinic to treat the infection, which is a common ailment in such a tropical setting.
His condition deteriorated rapidly and though doctors asked for him to be transferred immediately to Australia for treatment, he was sent to a hospital without an intensive care unit in the capital, Port Moresby, instead.
After suffering a series of cardiac arrests, Khazaei was transferred to a hospital in the Australian city of Brisbane where he was found to have sustained profound brain damage.
He died after being declared brain-dead.
At the time of his death, Khazaei had been detained at Manus for a year.
""If Mr Khazaei's clinical deterioration was recognised and responded to in a timely way at the [Manus] clinic, and he was evacuated to Australia within 24 hours of developing severe sepsis, he would have survived,"" Ryan wrote in his findings.
Similar deaths would be preventable if asylum seekers were relocated to places such as Australia or New Zealand, he said, something he called ""highly unlikely"" in the absence of a revision of policy.
Australia's immigration policy dictates that asylum seekers who reach the country by boat are sent to offshore detention centres are later resettled outside Australia if their asylum applications are accepted.
The centres have received fierce criticism for their poor living standards, with the United Nations human rights commission calling them ""inhumane"".
In a Tweet, Human Rights Watch Australia Director Elaine Pearson said that ""Medical care on Manus has gotten worse not better since 2014"".
""The solution is to get people off these islands once and for all,"" she said.
Behrouz Boochani, a Kurdish-Iranian journalist held on Manus Island since 2013 said: ""For a long time we have been asking Australian courts and independent organisations to investigate the deaths in these prison camps"".
""We think what has happened in the court today is a big step toward justice,"" he added.

Australia's Department of Home Affairs said it was reviewing the findings.
Manus Island's detention centre closed in late 2017 after PNG's Supreme Court ruled it was unconstitutional.
The 600 men still at the processing centre were moved to transition centres. The Guardian newspaper in March said 85 had left the island as of March 4 for resettlement.
On May 31, 245 people remained in Naru's detention centre, 22 of them children.

The 36-year-old mother of six has been living for three years now at al-Khadra, a camp for internally displaced persons (IDPs) tucked behind blocks of dilapidated apartment buildings in Iraq's capital, Baghdad.
Like many others across the country, Hend was forced to flee her home in 2015 as military operations and ISIL attacks escalated after the armed group's fighters swept through Iraq, occupying one-third of its territory.
Following Baghdad's victory over ISIL last year, the families in the camp, which numbered in the hundreds in 2016, were expected to return to their homes.
But dozens of them, including Ali's, had nothing to go back to.
""I visited my home three months ago, but everything was destroyed,"" says Hend, recalling her trip to al-Qa'im town in Anbar province. ""The walls and windows are gone. The foundations [of the house] are gone. It's just part of the roof that remains.""
The devastation, poverty and a lack of services in the recaptured areas forced Hend, like many other displaced Iraqis, to choose the lesser of two evils and stay in the camp.
""I came back to the camp because there was nothing [in Anbar],"" she says. ""[There's] no water, no electricity, and no work.""
The about 100 residents of al-Khadra camp are among the 2.14 million Iraqis who have been displaced since January 2014, according to the UN's refugee agency, the UNHCR.
Inside the camp, which offers residents little more than shelter from the scorching summer heat, children run up and down its arid walkways and play in the sand between rows of neatly set tents.
As women hang their children's washed clothes to dry in the sun, while others cook meals on bunsen burners inside the tents that have housed them for years, there is no sign of this camp closing down any time soon.
Hend says that if the government provided the IDPs with the most basic needs in Anbar, which lies 400km northwest of the capital Baghdad, she would go back immediately.
""If there were basic services, we'd return [home] from tomorrow, even if it means that we sustain ourselves by eating grass.""
For Dalya Ali, just like Like Hend, heading home to Fallujah, another city in Anbar province, is not a viable option.
""I went back to Fallujah a few months ago. I was forced to live in a tent for three months because everything is gone,"" says Dalya, a 31-year-old mother of five.
""It was too much to bear with no water and no place to live, so I came back.""
Families who live at al-Khadra are given a tent and a monthly salary of 20,000 Iraqi dinars ($18) per individual to cover the cost of food and other basic items.
Life, however, is still difficult.
With electricity shortages across the country, people have to buy fuel or pay privately owned generators to get by. For the camp's residents, this is not an option.
According to Dahaa al-Rawi, the camp founder and manager who is also a member of the Baghdad local government, donations by local charities and funds from international organisations, including the World Food Programme, are becoming depleted.
""We don't have enough money to pay for the electricity,"" says al-Rawi. ""They (residents) have to pay for that themselves.""
Dalya, who says her life was simple but settled back home, wonders how long she will have to remain at the camp.
""We can barely get by but we have nowhere else to go. Until when our situation will remain like this? Life has become too hard.""
For the Iraqi government, the challenging situation for IDPs will not be resolved until the recaptured areas are rebuilt. Yet, this is a mammoth task, one that is tied to Baghdad receiving more support from the international community.
Sattar Nawroz, a spokesperson for the migration and displacement ministry, says authorities are hoping to achieve this goal. He admits, however, that this is becoming increasingly difficult.
""The ideal situation is for displaced families is that they return voluntarily to their homes but this requires for these areas to be become ready to receive them,"" says Nawroz.
""This requires for us to rebuild the infrastructure and provide basic services including water, electricity and education.
""With so many crises in the region, funds from regional and international donors have shrunk,"" he adds, explaining that delays in government formation are further delaying this process.
With the final results of the May 12 elections yet to be approved by a federal court, and despite the last parliament's term ending on June 31, a new government has yet to be formed.
But, for Hend, waiting any longer is becoming too much.
""Our life is hell no matter what,"" she says.
""We came here [to the camp] and it's hell. And if we were to go home it would still be hell.
""I wish I never had to go through all this.""

Thaer last spoke with his son over a WhatsApp video call on Sunday night, since Arkan was staying overnight with his 78-year-old grandmother in the same Dheisheh refugee camp to help take care of her.
""I swear I love you,"" Arkan told his father, showing him what he had bought for Ghassan, his younger brother.
""I bought him three types of ice cream and chips, so you don't say that I don't like my younger brother,"" Arkan told Thaer.
""Then he repeated how much he loves me over and over again. I asked him what's wrong, but he kept saying 'nothing, but I just swear I love you',"" Thaer recounted to Al Jazeera.
The following morning Thaer received a call informing him at first that Arkan had been shot in the leg, ""to avoid horrifying"" him.
But as he rushed back to the camp, his gut feeling that his son had in fact been killed only grew stronger.
Israeli forces had shot Arkan in the chest during confrontations before dawn that day as the soldiers raided the camp to arrest youth. The camp is located just south of Bethlehem in the occupied West Bank.
His family describes Arkan as an active, social and hardworking student who dreamed of studying mechanics in Germany to become an electrician or car mechanic. He had just finished the ninth grade and was enrolled to attend a nearby industrial high school in September.
Israeli soldiers have killed another Palestinian child. 15-year-old Arkan Thaer Mezher was shot by Israeli occupation forces as they raided Dheisheh refugee camp in Bethlehem, the West Bank. There will be no accountability.https://t.co/mpL3DjAFNhhttps://t.co/hogcdCwoFS pic.twitter.com/Sr0D6Fjips
At the young age of 11, he had already learned how to make sofas and chairs. Noticing his son's natural talent, Thaer set up a workshop for him a few years ago.
""He was always smiling and his face always happy and welcoming,"" Thaer said of his son.
Growing up the second-eldest of seven kids in a poor family, Arkan was always a big help, his uncle Abdel Hameed Mizhar told Al Jazeera. During the holy month of Ramadan, he sold fruits and vegetables from a cart to help provide for the family.
""I wish that Arkan, my nephew, could be the last martyr from the Palestinian nation that seeks freedom and peace,"" Abdel Hameed Mizhar said.
Residents of Dheisheh say Israeli forces began raiding the camp as they regularly do, just before the dawn prayer around 3:30am to arrest youth and began ""heavily"" firing tear gas, stun grenades and live ammunition.
According to researchers from Defence for Children International - Palestine (DCIP), Arkan was shot with a single live bullet near his heart, which exited through his back. He was in the main alleyway entrance next to the camp's main road where the confrontations were taking place when he was shot.
His autopsy revealed that he was most likely shot from a short distance of approximately 10 to 15 metres, said Ayed Abu Eqtaish, accountability program director at DCIP.
The Israeli army told the media they had arrested two young men suspected of ""terror activity"" during their raid.
Israel says these routine raids are necessary for security reasons, but Abdel Hameed Mizhar says this reasoning doesn't add up.
""They killed him in cold blood as they usually do,"" Abdel Hameed told Al Jazeera.
""The arrests happened on the east side of the camp and the kid was killed [about 800 metres away] on the west side at the main street. So it's not related; it's just an innocent kid,"" Abdel Hameed said, adding that the number of soldiers raiding the camp was unusually large.
""With the number of soldiers, whoever witnessed this scene would arrive at the conclusion that they had an order to kill,"" Abdel Hameed said.
""[These are] political decisions made by the gang of Netanyahu and the extreme right to practice not just apartheid but brutality, which is worse than apartheid.""
The spokesperson for the Israeli forces did not respond to Al Jazeera for comment.
The army told media that residents had been ""throwing improvised explosive devices, Molotov cocktails and stones"" during their raid.
Two Palestinians were reportedly were shot in the leg. Altogether, 11 Palestinians were detained that night across the occupied West Bank in raids, which are a nightly occurrence.
There are around 6,000 Palestinians in Israeli jails, including around 300 children, with 440 individuals held without charge or trial.
Arkan is the 31st Palestinian child to be killed by Israeli forces so far this year, the majority of whom were aged 13-15, according to DCIP.
He is the sixth child fatality in the occupied West Bank, with the vast majority of children killed in the besieged Gaza Strip during the Great March of Return this year.
""[Our] documentation reveals that there was no need at all to shoot at the children. The culture of impunity that Israeli soldiers enjoy gives them a green light to shoot to kill,"" Abu Eqtaish of DCPI said.
""In almost all cases the Israeli authorities do not open investigations in the killing of Palestinian children and in case they do open an investigation, they close the probe without indicting Israeli soldiers.""
Accountability for fatal shootings of minors is extremely rare. Abu Eqtaish noted that there has been only one incident - the killing of 17-year-old Nadeem Nawara - that resulted in an investigation and indictment.
Ben Deri, an Israeli border police officer, was sentenced to nine months in prison last April for killing Nawara with an Israeli M16 round to the chest during a demonstration in May 2014. Nawara posed no threat to the soldiers.
Under international law, lethal force may only be used when a direct and mortal threat to life or serious injury exists.
""His punishment wasn't consistent with the gravity of the crimes that he committed,"" Abu Eqtaish said.
Palestinian stone throwers, however, can face up to 20 years in jail.
Rana Nazzal, a Palestinian who regularly volunteers with the Shoruq organisation in Dheisheh, told Al Jazeera that violence ending in arrest, injury and death is part of everyday life for the youth who live there.
""The Israeli army enters the camp every week, often multiple times,"" Nazzal said.
""Older children and teenagers begin to understand that this type of violence isn't normal and you see a lot of teenagers writing, making art or music, becoming socially and politically active or in other ways expressing their hardship.""
""They aren't surprised any more, but that doesn't mean they don't carry the trauma. Like one 17-year-old boy told me yesterday, it will eventually hit you - that you lost your friend or your brother - but it sometimes takes months to feel the pain,"" Nazzal said.
Ehab Iwidat contributed to the report from the occupied West Bank.

This included about 1,442 children who were returned to parents who were in US Immigration Customs Enforcement custody, and another 378 who were released under a variety of other circumstances.
Government lawyers said 711 other children were not eligible for reunification with their parents by Thursday's deadline, which was set by a federal judge in San Diego. In 431 of these cases, the families could not be reunited because the parents were no longer in the United States.
The parents and children were separated as part of President Donald Trump's ""zero tolerance"" policy towards immigration.
The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), which brought the case against the government, said in Thursday's court filing that data showed ""dozens of separated children still have not been matched to a parent"".
ACLU lawyer Lee Gelernt accused the government in a statement of ""picking and choosing who is eligible for reunification"" and said it would ""hold the government accountable and get these families back together"".
In a call with journalists after the court filing, US Department of Health and Human Services official Chris Meekins said it was awaiting guidance from the court about how to proceed with the children of 431 parents no longer in the US. The Office of Refugee Resettlement is an agency of department.
The government did not say in the call or in its court filing how many of those parents were deported.
The American Immigration Lawyers Association (AILA) submitted court documents containing testimony from parents who say they were coerced into signing off on their deportations. ""In nearly all of the cases we've seen, government officials used threats, false promises, misinformation and other coercive tactics,"" the group's president, Anastasia Tonello said in a statement. ""The government's conduct calls into question whether any of these parents understood what they were agreeing to, whether they knew what was happening to their children, and whether any were given information about the legal remedies available to protect themselves against deportation.""
One immigrant, Douglas Almendarez, told Reuters news agency he believed that returning to Honduras was the only way to be reunited with his 11-year-old son.
""They told me: 'He's ahead of you,'"" said Almendarez, 37, in the overgrown backyard of his modest soda shop several hours drive from the Honduran capital of Tegucigalpa. ""It was a lie.""
The ACLU said the government has not yet provided it with information about the reunifications of children aged five to 17 with their parents, including the location and timing of them.
""This information is critical both to ensure that these reunifications have, in fact, taken place and to enable class counsel to arrange for legal and other services for the reunited families,' it said.
Immigration advocates said the government's push to meet the court's deadline to reunite families was marred by confusion.
Maria Odom, vice president of legal services for Kids in Need of Defense, said two children the group represented were sent from New York to Texas to be reunited with their mother. When they arrived, they learned their mother had already been deported, Odom told reporters during a conference call.
Odom said her group does not know where the children, aged 9 and 14, have been taken.
It was an example, she said, ""of how impossible it is to track these children once they are placed in the black hole of reunification"".
The US Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
An outcry at home and abroad forced US President Donald Trump to order a halt to the separations in June. Judge Dana Sabraw in San Diego ordered the government to reunite the families and set Thursday as the deadline.
But the pace has been slow; children and parents are being housed in different parts of the country, while many adults have been deported.
Sabraw has criticised some aspects of the process, but in recent days, he has praised government efforts.
The ACLU and government lawyers will return to court on Friday to discuss how to proceed.

The vast majority of the 1,504 deaths were drownings that occurred as people tried to cross from Libya to Italy (1,111), according to the data collected for the Missing Migrants Project.
This was followed by 304 deaths on the route to Spain and 89 on the way to Greece.
In a statement on Friday, the IOM said 304 fatalities were recorded between January and July 25, ""far outpacing the 124 recorded in the equivalent period of 2017 - and the 224 recorded as drowned or missing during all of last year"".
The number of people who have arrived in Europe this year is 55,001, a decrease of 50 percent compared with the same period last year.
However, on a per capita basis, 2018 is one of the deadliest years yet because the number of people trying to reach Europe is significantly lower.
For the fifth year in a row, more than 1,000 migrants have died in the #Mediterranean:🔴 2014: 3,283🔴 2015: 3,783🔴 2016: 5,143🔴 2017: 3,139🔴 2018: 1,504 (until 27/7) pic.twitter.com/YejQavW8pS
The IOM said that in recent months there was a big increase in the number of people trying to cross the Mediterranean to reach Spain instead of Italy.
""Arrivals to Italy trail Spain by almost 3,000; a week ago the gap was less than 200,"" the statement said.
""Additionally, 3,125 migrants have attempted to enter Spain irregularly via the country's African enclaves of Melilla and Ceuta, according to Spanish authorities,"" it added.
""With this month's figures, Spain is the Mediterranean's most-sought destination for irregular migrants travelling by sea, surpassing Italy and Greece.""
Greece, which was the main destination for many people before the European Union struck a deal with Turkey which halted the number of refugee arrivals, has seen a 50 percent increase compared with the same period last year.
In total, more than 5,000 people have arrived in Greece so far this year.
Italy on the other hand, has seen a dramatic drop in the number of migrants arriving.
More than 640,000 people have reached Italy by boat from Africa in the past five years.
In recent months, Italy's new populist government has turned away several rescue vessels patrolling the Mediterranean to save refugees crossing the sea from drowning.
Since taking up his post in early June, Italy's far-right Interior Minister Matteo Salvini, who is also one of the country's two deputy prime ministers, has pushed the divisive issue of migration to the forefront of the EU agenda by refusing to open his country's ports to migrant rescue ships.
Under the European Union's so-called ""Dublin rules"", asylum seekers must be processed in the country where they first arrive - usually Italy, Greece or Spain.
In an attempt to reduce the number of refugees trying to reach Europe, the leaders of Italy and France have urged the EU to set up asylum processing centres in Africa to prevent refugees and migrants from undertaking the journey across the Mediterranean, a move widely criticised because of the often dire circumstances in those countries.

Published on Friday, the report accuses Greek authorities of subjecting thousands of newly arrived refugees and migrants, who entered the country by via land borders, to ""living conditions [that] do not meet international standards"".
The report highlights accusations of verbal and physical abuse at the hands of Greek police in three government-operated centres in northern Greece.
Among the thousands of refugees and migrants enduring decrepit living conditions in the reception centres are pregnant women, new mothers and survivors of sexual assault, the report alleged. Reported problems in the facilities were compounded by a lack of translators, it added.
Based on interviews with 49 asylum seekers and migrants, HRW's new report accused authorities of warehousing new arrivals in malodorous, dark cells.
""People told us they were being treated so poorly in these facilities that they felt less than human,"" said Hillary Margolis, women's rights researcher at Human Rights Watch.
""Greece has a responsibility to uphold basic standards of care for everyone in its custody, regardless of their immigration status.""
Identified in the report as Leila, a pregnant 24-year-old Syrian said: ""I desperately need to go to the doctor to see how my baby is, but the doctor here said, 'When you move to another camp, you'll see a doctor there.'""
Several interviewees told the rights group that they were subjected to or witnessed verbal harassment, while two alleged that police officers had beaten asylum seekers.
In response, Hellenic Police said they have received no complaints of violence, adding that they have ""zero tolerance for human rights abuses"".
The accusations come at a time when other European countries have voiced their desire to return more asylum seekers to Greece in accordance with the so-called ""Dublin rules"".
Tens of thousands of refugees and migrants are bottlenecked in Greece, unable to leave owing to sealed borders across the so-called ""Western Balkan route"". Those who do leave are only able to do so with the assistance of smugglers.
As of May, the United Nations refugee agency (UNHCR) estimated that 60,000 refugees and migrants were in the country, including at least 14,000 who were stuck on Greek islands.
More than a million people arrived in the country in 2016, according to the UNHCR, while upwards of 15,000 have arrived by sea so far in 2018.
This year, a growing number of refugees and migrants have reached the country by crossing the land border with Turkey in the north. Last week, Greek media reported that four people went missing after their boat capsized on the Evros River, situated on the Greece-Turkey border.
Earlier this year, the Greek police said that 1,658 refugees and migrants were detained in March after crossing into Greece through the Evros River, which is situated on the Turkish border.
That number was more than five times higher than the same period in 2017, which saw only 262 people detained on the country's frontier with Turkey.

The Group of 77 was established in 1964 by 77 countries and was designed to promote their collective economic interests, as well as to enhance their joint negotiating capacity on all major international economic issues within the UN.
Over the years, the bloc has expanded to include 135 members today, which represents 80 percent of the world's population. The bloc also speaks as one voice at the General Assembly.
Palestine will take over from the current presiding country Egypt in January 2019.
In a telephone interview with The New York Times, Palestine's UN ambassador Riyad Mansour confirmed the move, and said Palestine ""will be negotiating on behalf of 135 countries.""
The move is widely regarded as a progressive move on behalf of Palestine, which holds an observer non-member state status at the UN. However, Israel has already voiced its strong opposition.
""The goal of the Group of 77 originally was to facilitate the economic advancement of underdeveloped nations,"" Israel's ambassador, Danny Danon said in a statement to The New York Times.
""It is unfortunate that it will now become a platform for spreading lies and incitement. This will not promote the G-77's goals, and encourages the Palestinians to not engage in negotiations for peace.""
Israel's ally, the United States, raised the ire of the Palestinian Authority by recognising Jerusalem as the capital of Israel last December, resulting in the PA severing diplomatic relations with it.
The US has also recently cut funding to the UN Refugee and Relief Agency (UNRWA) which serves millions of Palestinians in refugee camps in the occupied territories and neighbouring countries.
Last month, the US pulled out of the UN Human Rights Council, citing anti-Israel bias.

""Where are the Arab countries when it comes to supporting compromises that are necessary for peace?"" Haley said in remarks on Tuesday during a UN Security Council meeting.
""It is time for the regional states, in particular, to step up and really help, instead of just making speeches thousands of miles away,"" Haley said at the UNSC's monthly meeting on the Middle East.
""Where are the Arab countries when it comes to encouraging reconciliation between Palestinian factions, which is essential to peace?""
Haley highlighted US assistance to the Palestinians, saying that Washington provided $300m in bilateral aid last year, and ""over six billion dollars in bilateral assistance to Palestinians"" since 1993.
She also mentioned US aid to the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) - but without mentioning that total has been significantly reduced.
In January, US President Donald Trump's administration announced that it was withholding $65m of a planned $125m funding instalment for the relief agency.
The move essentially cut the only lifeline available to millions of registered refugees across the Middle East who have been relying on UNRWA's services for more than 70 years.
According to UN officials, the US, previously UNRWA's top donor, provided $364m to the agency last year, but only $60m this year.
""How much have the Arab countries - some of whom are wealthy countries - how much have they given to the Palestinians?"" Haley continued during Tuesday's meeting.
""Last year, Iran's contribution to UNRWA was zero. Algeria's contribution to UNRWA was zero. Tunisia's contribution to UNRWA was zero,"" she said.
Her French counterpart Francois Delattre asked the US to reconsider its decision of suspending aid to the refugee agency, calling on Washington to ""to shoulder its responsibilities"" to help fill the agency's estimated $200m gap.
Since the US decision, several attempts have been made to fill the gap in funding in a bid to help more than five million refugees in the occupied West Bank, Gaza Strip, Jordan, Lebanon, and war-torn Syria.
Last month, a conference held by the UN to raise money for basic services including food aid, medical care and sanitation, managed to garner pledges.
And in March, a summit in Rome co-organised by Jordan, Sweden, and Egypt to help fund the agency managed to raise $100m in aid pledges.
Olof Skoog of Sweden, the current president of the Security Council, let his frustration with US policy show, saying: ""Everyone is waiting for a credible peace plan.""
""We haven't seen that yet. It is now about a year since we were informed about a plan and we have not seen it yet. It is a problem that there is no credible plan on the table,"" Skoog said.
Peace talks between Palestinian leaders - who view East Jerusalem as the capital of their future state - and Israel have been at a standstill since Trump recognised Israel as the capital of Jerusalem, breaking years of US policy.
Meanwhile, Palestinians in the besieged Gaza Strip have recently been protesting the cuts that have led to the termination of at least 1,000 UNRWA employees.

Arkan Thaer Mizhar, 15, was shot in the chest in Dheisheh refugee camp in Bethlehem, in the southern West Bank, the Palestinian health ministry said on Monday. His funeral is due to take place later on Monday.
A security source told WAFA news agency that Israeli forces stormed the camp and conducted house raids. The soldiers fired live ammunition as well as tear gas and stun grenades.

According to WAFA, two young Palestinian men were wounded and another two were arrested.
A medical source at Beit Jala Hospital confirmed that two young men were wounded by live ammunition in the foot, describing their condition as stable.
There are around 6,500 Palestinians in Israeli jails; 500 of whom are detained without charges under the administrative detention policy which allows Israel to detain a prisoner for up to six months, renewable indefinitely.
Six prisoners are currently on hunger strike, including Hasan Shokeh, in protest against the administrative detention.
The Israeli army said its forces had entered the camp and arrested two people suspected of ""terror activity"". ""During the operation, a violent riot was instigated in which Palestinians hurled rocks and threw firebombs and grenades at [Israeli] soldiers,"" the army said in a statement. Soldiers fired live rounds at the protesters, the statement added.
The camp is in a part of the West Bank supposedly under full Palestinian control but the Israeli army regularly carries out raids in such areas.
It says the operations are necessary to arrest suspects, but they often spark protests among young Palestinians, many of whom are killed or injured during such raids.
While tensions have flared over recent weeks between Israel and Hamas in besieged Gaza, the West Bank has been relatively calm during that time.
According to Defence for Children International - Palestine, Israeli forces have so far killed at least 30 Palestinian children in 2018 in the Occupied Palestinian Territories, whereas in 2017, 15 children were killed.

The government sends anyone who tries to enter the country by sea to camps on Papua New Guinea's Manus Island or on Nauru in the Pacific for processing.
Protesters took to the streets on Saturday to mark the fifth anniversary of the policy's reintroduction, when in 2013 Canberra significantly toughened its stance, signing deals with the Pacific nations and declaring that anyone arriving by boat had ""no chance"" of being settled in Australia.
""The policy that was introduced in 2013, to expel people - the 'Fortress Australia' policy that they [the government] put in place - that has to go,"" rally organiser Ian Rintoul from the Refugee Action Coalition said at the protest in Sydney.
""So we fight to close the detention centres on Manus and Nauru, but we fight in that process to bring them here.""
Hundreds marched through Sydney chanting ""Free, free the refugees"".
Banners read: ""Five years too long, evacuate Manus and Nauru"". Joint rallies were held in Melbourne, Adelaide, Brisbane, Canberra and Perth.
Canberra says its policy deters people from embarking on treacherous sea journeys, but rights groups and the UN have slammed the country for turning its back on vulnerable people, as reports of abuse, suicide and despondency filter out of the camps.
""Any country that openly rejects compassion and instead tortures people who we know are innocent, in order to make them a deterrent ... has somehow lost its soul,"" said Father Dave Smith, who recently returned from a visit to the Manus camp.
An Iranian man died in a apparent suicide on Nauru in June, with his body arriving in Australia last week after what Rintoul said took much lobbying of a reluctant Australian government, which initially said the man would be buried in Nauru or repatriated to Iran.
The deceased man's mother, who requested his body be buried in a place the family could one day visit, remains on Nauru with her younger son. They were refused entry to Australia for the burial, Rintoul added.
This was the fifth death on Nauru since Australia's offshore detention ramped up in July 2013, rights groups say, while seven have died on Manus during the same period.
Canberra has tried to resettle those recognised as refugees to third countries such as the US. More than 100 have been transferred to the US as part of a deal made between the two governments under the administration of former US President Barack Obama.
About 1,600 people are believed to be still on Nauru and Manus.

A convoy of buses on Friday mid-afternoon carried the first batch of rebels, their family members and assorted civilians to opposition-held territory in the north where they will live among more than one million others displaced by Syria's seven-year-long civil war.
The surrender in Quneitra, in line with a deal that was struck between rebels and pro-government forces, is a big victory for President Bashar al-Assad whose troops are close to reclaiming complete control of the country's south.
According to state media, the agreement ""stipulates the departure to Idlib [province] of terrorists who reject the settlements"", and allow those who wish to remain to ""settle"" their status with the authorities, meaning accepting a return of state rule.
The state-controlled al-Ikhbariya TV station broadcast footage on Friday of fighters dressed in fatigues boarding buses in the village of Um Batina in Quneitra, which adjoins the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights.
The pro-government Central Military Media outlet said there were 50 buses ready to transport rebels to the opposition-held Idlib province in northwest Syria.
A military news service run by Lebanon's Hezbollah, which is fighting in support of Damascus, said buses ""carrying militants"" had left the city of al-Quneitra headed north.
The evacuation was also reported by Anadolu Agency correspondents, while a Reuters news agency witness at a vantage point on the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights saw a steady movement of people out of the village of al-Qahtaniya, near Quneitra. A stream of motorcycles, heavily laden cars and flatbed trucks packed with men, women and children departed the village.
Al-Ikhbariya said that a second convoy of buses was preparing to depart with another batch of Quneitra fighters.
A Syrian army offensive launched earlier in June has managed to retake much of southern Syria's Deraa and Quneitra provinces, previously in rebel hands.
With Russian backing, the relentless aerial bombardment campaign forced the opposition into a succession of surrender deals that left them with little choice but to move to rebel-held territory in the north - notably Idlib province - or accept a return to Assad rule.
The developments in Quineitra came as the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) on Friday urged all parties to the conflict to provide safe passage for the estimated 140,000 civilians displaced as a result of the recent surge in violence.
The plea followed an intense bombing campaign on the densely populated town of Nawa in Deraa province earlier this week.
The UNHCR also expressed its readiness to discuss its plans to set up centres for returning Syrian refugees, insisting that returns must be safe and voluntary.
An estimated 13,000 Syrian refugees returned from neighbouring countries in the first half of 2018 with some 750,000 internally displaced also going back to their homes, UNHCR spokesman Andrej Mahecic said at a news conference in Geneva.

A total of 55 buses carrying rebel fighters and members of their families departed the strategic area in Quneitra province that adjoins the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights on Friday, Syria's official SANA news agency said.
The UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) said a first convoy of some 2,800 people had arrived on Saturday at the Morek transit point, in Hama province, which separates opposition from government-held areas.
The fighters and their families are expected to be transferred to buses run by local non-governmental organisations before continuing their journey to rebel areas in Idlib and Aleppo provinces.
Al Jazeera's Adham Abu Al Husam, reporting from Hama province, said that transports would take place until Monday, with as many as 13,000 people expected to arrive.
""There will be more people coming, huge numbers coming from south to north,"" he said, as the first group of buses was arriving.
""There will need to be a lot of resources and a concerted effort to accommodate such large numbers of people. They will initially be taken to already prepared shelters in northern Syria"".
The evacuations came after a surrender deal was reached earlier in the week between the opposition and Russian negotiators acting on behalf of the Syrian government. It provides for the safe passage of residents who do not wish to live under the rule of President Bashar al-Assad.
Syrian forces, backed by a Russian air campaign, have been pushing into the edges of Quneitra province following a relentless aerial bombardment campaign last month that routed rebels in adjoining Deraa province.
Pro-government forces have recaptured 90 percent of the territory through similar surrender deals with the opposition whereby the latter agrees to also hand over medium to heavy weaponry.
On Saturday, Syrian state television announced pro-government forces had captured a string of villages in a zone extending between the two southwestern provinces.
Deraa city is seen as the birthplace of the Syrian uprising after protests in 2011 against the government's torture of teenagers spread across the country.
The recent evacuation deal has left the Syrian government in control over large swaths of territory that straddle both provinces and border neighbouring Jordan and Israel.
It has now turned its attention to pockets of territory still in the hands of fighters from the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL, also known as ISIS).
The developments in Quneitra came as the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) on Friday urged all parties to the conflict to provide safe passage for the estimated 140,000 civilians displaced as a result of the recent surge in violence.
Last week, dozens of Syrians sought refuge near the border with the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights but were turned back by Israeli border guards.
UNHCR spokeswoman Rula Amin told Al Jazeera that Syrians have been stranded without shelter or assistance for weeks.
""These people left their homes weeks ago, looking for safety, trying to protect their families,"" she said.
The UNHCR also expressed its readiness to discuss its plans to set up centres for returning Syrian refugees, insisting that returns must be safe and voluntary.
An estimated 13,000 Syrian refugees returned from neighbouring countries in the first half of 2018 with some 750,000 internally displaced also going back to their homes, UNHCR spokesman Andrej Mahecic said at a news conference in Geneva.
The conflict has claimed the lives of more than 465,000 Syrians and left over a million injured.
More than half the country's prewar population, some 12 million people, have fled Syria or been internally displaced.

The Sweden Democrats polled at a record high 20 percent in May, according to an Ispos poll in daily Dagens Nyheter, placing their chances at becoming kingmakers in the September 9 elections within the realm of possibility.
While they have long been shunned by other political parties, analysts and observers worry that they are increasingly setting the parameters of public discourse in the country.
In addition to calling for a referendum on European Union membership, the Sweden Democrats have demanded a freeze on migration and a crackdown on crime.
In its official platform, the party says its anti-migrant policies are driven by ""love and confidence in our country"".
""If we are the second biggest or biggest party in parliament and the other parties still believe we can be ignored, and pretend we don't exist, then we must flex our muscles,"" party leader Jimmie Akesson told Reuters in an interview.
Nicholas Aylott, political science professor at Sodertorn University
The Sweden Democrats' swift rise in polls comes on the heels of far-right and anti-migrant parties' gains elsewhere in Europe.
""It's particularly sensitive in Sweden, where there is a very strong anti-racist norm in almost all walks of life,"" Nicholas Aylott, an associate professor of political science at Sodertorn University, told Al Jazeera.
""Open expressions of conventional racism are really very rare in Sweden, and the rise of the Sweden Democrats, with its history, is terribly sensitive in Sweden and raises emotions.""
In Hungary, far-right Prime Minister Viktor Orban was re-elected in April after a campaign that placed a hyper-focus on refugees, migrants and the supposed ""Islamisation"" of Europe.
In Italy, the new coalition formed by the anti-establishment Five Star Movement and Matteo Salvini's ultra-nationalist League (formerly Northern League) has moved quickly to stop the flow of refugees and migrants.
Austria's far-right Freedom Party (FPO) became a junior coalition partner in December after striking a deal with the ruling right-wing Austrian People's Party, and the pair have since prioritised tightening borders and cracking down on asylum seekers.
And last Autumn, the far-right, nativist Alternative for Germany (AfD) entered the German Bundestag after a campaign that vilified refugees.
At the time of publication, Paula Bieler, the migration spokesperson for Sweden Democrats, had not replied to Al Jazeera's multiple requests for a comment.
Since 2012, an estimated 400,000 people have requested asylum in Sweden, more than 160,000 of whom did so in 2015, the year of the mass influx of refugees and migrants into Europe.
Explaining that Sweden's elections are usually dominated by right-wing and left-wing blocs, Aylott argued that the Sweden Democrats have ""supplanted"" traditional electoral debates.
""The rise of the Sweden Democrats completely disrupts that because it deprives each of the two blocs of a realistic chance of winning their own majority,"" he said.
The current coalition is a fragile alliance between the centre-left Social Democrats and the Green Party, which came to power after elections in 2014.
Founded in 1988, the Sweden Democrats clinched just under 13 percent in the 2014 elections, a dramatic improvement compared its previous electoral performance.
It currently holds 42 seats in the Riksdag, the country's legislature.
Jonas Hinnfors, a political science professor at the University of Gothenburg, told Al Jazeera that the party's focus on migration allowed them to capitalise on frustrations among parts of the electorate.
Meanwhile, their Eurosceptic positions are less popular with Swedes.
Polls have consistently found that ""most Swedes do not want to leave the EU"", said Hinnfors.
Even so, party leader Akesson announced last month that he hopes a referendum on EU membership will be held after the September elections.
Migration, however, appears to be the driving force for the Sweden Democrats' surge in popularity.
""They very well could be kingmakers,"" Hinnfors said, explaining that the far-right group had set the tone for electoral debate by dragging other parties into debates about migration.
If they did so, the Sweden Democrats would exert a far greater influence on policies and would likely continue its tunnel-vision focus on migration.
In turn, other parties, including the Social Democrats, have adopted a more hardline stance on migration and borders.
In May, the ruling party announced plans to cut nearly in half the number of refugees and migrants entering the country.
At the time, Immigration Minister Helene Fritzon said Sweden should accept 14,000-15,000 refugees per year, as opposed to the 27,000 it took in last year.
""Even if the number of asylum seekers has dropped significantly in Sweden, it is significantly higher than [what it should be given] our population share in Europe,"" she told reporters.
Other proposed measures include tighter identification checks on refugees and migrants and restricting asylum recipients' ability to choose where they reside, the English-language Local reported at the time.
""There was a sense of crisis in 2015 ... It was a huge commitment for the country's institutions and was incredibly costly,"" Aylott said.
""The consequences of that ... have to be the subject of a political discussion.
""It's not really surprising that issues of left and right have been supplanted by these new issues because they reflect a pretty profound change.""

The army, known as Tatmadaw, used the deadly August 25 attack as a pretext to launch a bloody offensive that forced tens of thousands of Rohingya, often described as the most persecuted community in the world, to flee to neighbouring Bangladesh.
The 162-page report, titled They Gave Them Long Swords, published by Fortify Rights on Thursday, found that the Myanmar military is guilty of committing ""crimes against humanity and genocide"".
It detailed how the Myanmar authorities had planned for attacks against the Rohingya civilians in Rakhine State, resulting in more than 700,000 crossing the border into Bangladesh in the worst refugee crisis since the Rwandan genocide.
""The Myanmar military would like the world to believe that it was fighting terrorism in Rakhine State and that this was a spontaneous response to the attacks of ARSA,"" Matthew Smith, the CEO of Fortify Rights, told Al Jazeera, referring to the Arkan Rohingya Salvation Army group.
""We have documented the way in which the military was making these systematic preparations weeks and months before August 25, 2017, which is when that attack by Rohingya militants took place,"" he added.
The UN and the US have called Myanmar military action against Rohingya civilians ""a textbook case of ethnic cleansing"" - a charge the Myanmar government has repeatedly denied.
Over 200 interviews were conducted over a 20-month period with Rohingya eyewitnesses and survivors, current and former members of ARSA, Bangladesh military officials, Myanmar military, international and local humanitarian aid workers, and physicians.
The report found that the Myanmar authorities undertook several measures prior to August 2017, such as systematically disarming Rohingya civilians by confiscating household items that might be used as weapons or in self-defence.
""They came and took all the knives away,"" said Rahana, a 50-year-old Rohingya mother of two from Nyaung Chaung village in Buthidaung township.
The authorities also trained and armed local non-Rohingya communities in northern Rakhine State to act as the ""regional police"", the report said.
""They gave them long swords,"" said Mohammed Rafiq, a 25-year-old Rohingya eyewitness to the massacre in the village of Tula Toli. ""I could see it. [The soldiers] handed [Rakhine civilians] swords. Even young Rakhine boys were given long swords, and they were moving around with the swords hanging on their backs.""
Other measures included suspending humanitarian aid and access to the Rohingya, systematically tearing down fencing and other structures around Rohingya homes in order to provide the military with greater line-of-sight on civilians, enforcing a Muslim-only curfew, and building up an unusually sizable military presence.
""One thing that we've learned - and the Rohingya community above all have learned - is that following the October 2016 violence, there was almost complete inaction from the international community, and that essentially paved the way for genocide to take place,"" Smith said.
""We do have hope this will spur meaningful international action,"" he continued.
""We have sent the report to the International Criminal Court and, right now, UN Security Council member states should apply unprecedented leverage against other member states on the Council to ensure that there is an ICC referral urgently.""
The report has also called for UN Security Council members to issue a global arms embargo on the Myanmar military, and to sanction the individuals responsible for atrocities against Rohingya and others.
""These individuals – such as General Min Aung Hlaing who has largely escaped detention for his role in orchestrating these genocidal attacks - should not only be sanctioned by governments but they should be investigated and potentially prosecuted for genocidal crimes against humanity,"" Smith said.
A Myanmar government spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment by AFP news agency.

Wearing a flowing shirt, Manazza Fatima wrapped a salmon-coloured scarf loosely around her head.
The 40-year-old Pakistani asylum seeker motioned to a two-person tent across the street from the camp's entrance, explaining that she has slept there for several nights with her husband and 16-month-old daughter.
Bored children mulled around the nearby security post at the entrance. People coming and going flashed their identification cards to the guards.
Fatima lifted her daughter's leg, revealing a tiny limb swollen and reddened from mosquito bites.
""They say they don't have any open places for us,"" she told Al Jazeera, referring to the camp administration.
Pulling out her asylum applicant card, she said: ""They won't help us here, they won't let us sleep inside and they won't give us any food or formula for the baby.""
Eva Cosse, Human Rights Watch researcher
Like many refugees and migrants across the country and on its islands, Fatima and her family, who have been in Greece for two and a half years, are still waiting for a final decision on their asylum application.
Since borders were slammed shut across the Balkans in early 2016, many determined to move on to Western Europe were left with few options, beyond resorting to smugglers.
In a bid to deter yet more people from going west, Germany, Hungary and other countries have in recent weeks called for asylum seekers who initially landed in Greece to be returned to the Mediterranean country.
Yet in Greece, asylum seekers and humanitarian groups have expressed concern, saying that the country is struggling to provide accommodation and services to those who are already here.
Late last month, Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras said a deal was reached to return refugees and migrants from Germany to Greece and Spain.
As part of the agreement, Germany was supposed to remove restrictions on thousands of family reunifications cases that would allow separated family members to reunite in that country.
And last week, Hungary's stridently anti-refugee prime minister, Viktor Orban, called for undocumented migrants who passed through Greece to be returned to the country en masse, even if they were not initially registered there.
""We only know one solution: close the borders,"" he said during a press conference with German Chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin.
According to Europe's so-called Dublin rules, asylum seekers should file their applications in the first member country they enter.
Kyriakos Giaglis, Greece's country director for the Danish Refugee Council, explained that previous attempts to return asylum seekers to Greece were ""never really"" implemented.
""It is, of course, a cause for concern. The criteria of it aren't very clear from a legal point of view,"" he told Al Jazeera.
""Here in Greece, all of the sites are overcrowded, and we have very bad situations in most of the sites,"" he added, explaining that people continue to sleep in informal or communal spaces in packed camps.
""We don't know where they would be returned.""
Eva Cosse, a researcher at Human Rights Watch, said Greece has improved living conditions in the camps since closed borders stranded tens of thousands in the country in early 2016.
Nonetheless, she said: ""We see that with the lack of support for Greece, and the fact that more and more people are gathering in Greece, the [asylum] system is breaking down again.""
She told Al Jazeera that most camps and accommodation centres on Greece's mainland are full or over capacity.
Largely confined to camps and with few options for work in Greece, which has endured nearly a decade of economic crisis and austerity, many see their future elsewhere in Europe.
Inside Eleonas, several rows of containers serve as temporary homes for its residents.
There are small, makeshift gardens by porches hobbled together from old doors and weather-worn scrap wood.
""I love you, mom,"" reads graffiti on a barrier encircling the camp.
Masoud Qahar, a 41-year-old Afghan, boiled a pot of tea on the stove in his cramped container. Sat on the floor, he spoke softly, hoping not to wake his sleeping roommate.
Arguing that returning more refugees and migrants to Greece would be a disaster, he said: ""We have no future here.""
At the time of publication, the Greek Ministry of Migration had not replied to Al Jazeera's request for a comment.
According to the United Nations refugee agency (UNHCR), there were nearly 60,000 refugees and migrants in Greece as of June.
Fleeing war and economic havoc, thousands continue to reach the country by land and sea each month, the agency said.
""UNHCR continues to call on the Greek government to ease overcrowding and improve conditions and services, including through speeding up of transfers and identifying adequate accommodation,"" Boris Cheshirkov, a spokesperson for the agency, told Al Jazeera.
Hoping to quell anger among politicians and locals on several Aegean islands, the Greek government has promised that asylum seekers returned from elsewhere in Europe will not return to the islands.
Greek Migration Minister Dimitris Vitsas recently decried Austrian Chancellor Sebastien Kurz's demands for tougher measures to prevent irregular migration on the EU's external frontiers and Orban's call for mass returns to Greece.
""As a government, we will not accept turning the country into a warehouse of souls,"" he said in an interview with Greek radio, as reported by the daily Ekathimerini.
""There are European leaders who are trying to impose a policy of autocracy, a policy of fortress Europe,"" he added, referring to Kurz and Orban.

https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/07/killed-love-remembering-photographer-niraz-saied-180717192158947.html,refugee,1729,Wed Jul 18 2018 14:21:39 GMT+0000,Farah Najjar,'They killed my love': Remembering photographer Niraz Saied,"An award-winning Palestinian photographer from the Yarmouk refugee camp in Syria has been confirmed dead years after his arrest by Syrian government forces, according to family members and close friends.
Niraz Saied, who was known for documenting life inside the camp in southern Damascus, was arrested by forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad in October 2015, shortly after being promised a secure exit from the country by the government.
After years of holding on to hope they would see their beloved relative again, family members in Syria's capital received confirmation that Saied died about 18 months ago, Ahmed Abbassi, a childhood friend and fellow photojournalist, told Al Jazeera on Monday. He was 26.
Saied's wife, who lives in Germany, wrote on Facebook her husband had been ""killed in the regime's prison"".
""There are no harder words to write than these,"" Lamis al-Khateeb said on Monday.
""They killed my love, my husband, they killed Niraz, they killed you my soulmate,"" added Khateeb, who fled Syria in 2011.
Abbassi said Saied's family members believe he was tortured to death inside a prison in southern Damascus.
""After about four months into his arrest, we stopped hearing anything about Niraz,"" said Abbassi.
""We tried to learn about his fate with various connections in the government but failed - they refused to say a word when they heard us inquire about Niraz, in particular.
""We knew then that something was not right.""
The Syrian government does not typically issue death certificates for detainees who die inside prisons, or deliver bodies back to the family for a proper burial, the UK-based Action Group for Palestinians of Syria told Al Jazeera.
Abbassi said Saied's parents requested his personal effects be returned to them, but they know it is highly unlikely.
Saied was born as a third-generation Palestinian refugee in Yarmouk, the largest refugee camp in Syria. His grandparents were driven out of their village Awlam in 1948 during the Nakba, or ""catastrophe"", referring to the ethnic cleansing of Palestine by Zionist paramilitaries and the near-total destruction of Palestinian society.
Together with Abbassi and a team of youth activists, Saied witnessed and captured in photos the changing stages of the camp.
Following the start of the Syrian uprising in March 2011, Yarmouk remained neutral until the autumn of 2012, when the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command allied itself with Assad's forces.
Gun battles with opposition fighters ensued over the next few months, followed by government-led air raids. A full-fledged siege was imposed at the end of 2012.
Conditions worsened, with the camp completely blockaded. Its remaining 18,000 out of 160,000 residents were forced to scavenge for whatever food was available - weeds, cats and dogs.
""The siege did not spare anyone or anything,"" recalled Abbassi, who recently resettled in Turkey. ""For almost two and a half years, not one morsel of food was let into the camp.""
It was at the time of the devastating siege when Saied's photography skills were truly put into practice.
His images documenting the hardships faced by thousands of Palestinian families living through one of the war's deadliest blockades appeared in local and international media, including Vice News and Electronic Intifada.
""We took photographs and fed various news outlets with lines of what we saw - from the effects of the siege to on-the-ground fighting and government air strikes,"" Abbassi said. ""It was our duty.""
As fighting intensified, Yarmouk was reduced to a shell of its former self. Its buildings were destroyed, the main streets - largely devoid of life - were strewn with rubble, the broken asphalt occasionally cracking amid the sound of sniper fire.
By April 2015, Yarmouk came under the control of Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL, also known as ISIS).
The seizure of the camp, coupled with the persistent lack of food and medicine despite 2014's partial lifting of the siege and the heavy battles - including between rebel groups - pushed many residents to negotiate evacuation deals, with opposition fighters at one side and government forces on the other.
Saied and a number of colleagues continued working in the camp, but after receiving death threats from ISIL over the summer they decided to accept a political settlement offered by the government, which perceived civilian activists with suspicion.
""This [settlement] was not unusual, but there were some government sources who were fishy and you had to know who to trust,"" said Abbassi, adding the deal included safe passage to Turkey and other neighbouring countries.
""When we left Yarmouk our psychological state was destroyed. Our homes and memories and entire lives were in Yarmouk, and leaving was not an easy thing,"" said Abbassi, who left Yarmouk at a later date following a similar deal, as he explained why many wanted to flee the country once they were no longer able to ensure their own safety.
After leaving Yarmouk, Saied settled in a rebel-controlled area in southern Damascus, where he kept a low profile.
While nine of his colleagues left for Turkey and eventually Europe, Saied was not able to leave, faced with constant government delays in facilitating his departure.
He began looking for another way out to join his wife in Germany, but on October 2, 2015, Syrian security forces raided his residence and took him to an intelligence branch in Damascus.
Saied's name was among the most prominent in Yarmouk - and his work struck a chord with viewers far beyond.
In 2014, the UN's agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, awarded him with the youth prize for best photograph for his image titled, Three Kings.
The photograph depicted three boys with shaved heads who, according to Saied, were denied permits to leave the country in order to get medical care in Europe.
""Their pale and tired faces tell the story of Yarmouk,"" Saied said in a 2014 interview with Electronic Intifada. ""But I haven't been able to see the children again and no one knows anything about them.""

Saied's footage also appeared in Letters from Yarmouk, a critically acclaimed 2014 documentary he co-produced, while his photos were displayed in exhibitions in the occupied West Bank city of Ramallah and Jerusalem.
According to Abbassi, Saied's work, which documented the different stages of the siege from 2012 until 2014, was a threat to the Assad government and prompted it to push for ""as many political settlements as possible"".
""They (the government) wanted no one to stay and wanted to destroy the presence of civil society in the camp,"" said Abbassi.
So far, the Syrian security services have kept quiet about the number of Palestinian prisoners and their fate.
Ahmad Hosain, head of Action Group, said details about detainees in Syrian prisons - whether dead or alive - are never officially made public. Instead, the group obtains its information from family members or from reporters on the ground.
According to Action Group, at least 527 Palestinian Syrians have died as a result of torture in government jails. At least 1,680 Palestinians are still in detention, and hundreds more are missing, Hosain told Al Jazeera.
Government sources may, on occasion, inform families directly of the death of their loved ones, however, that only occurs in ""10 out of 100 cases"", Hosain said. Saied's family was one such example.
""Throughout the last eight years, there has never been an official way in which families can seek information about the fate of their detained child,"" he added.
The act of not returning the bodies of detainees to their families is common practice across Syria's prisons, said Hosain. Many of these bodies are then ""set on fire"" in the respective detention facilities, usually to cover up mass killings, he said.
Last year, the United States accused the Syrian government of installing a crematorium in a military prison in order to destroy the remains of thousands of murdered prisoners.
Another prominent case in Yarmouk is that of actor and filmmaker Hassan Hassan, a friend of Saied's.
Hassan used humour as a means to mock the siege and portrayed the reality of life in the camp by acting in comedic skits. He liked to joke that his grandparents spent their honeymoon ethnically cleansed from their village in Palestine.
In October 2013, he and his wife decided to leave the camp. But he was arrested by Syrian government forces and days later, he died from torture in prison, according to Action Group.
Hassan's father was informed about his son's death two months later.
When asked why the Syrian government is targeting critical Palestinian civilians, Action Group's Hosain argued some in the Assad government expected the entire diaspora in Syria to ""repay owed debt"".
""It's like they expected them to side with Assad since it was the state that welcomed them into Syria, and since it was the state that granted them with many rights,"" he said.
At least 3,826 Palestinians have been killed as a result of the war in Syria over the past seven years, according to Action Group.
While more than 1,100 lost their lives as a result of government air raids, others died from lack of medical attention, artillery fire, assassinations, execution and suffocation from suspected chemical weapons.
Action Group said it has for years faced various obstacles during the course of their documentation process, the most prominent of which is the families' hesitation to speak out about violations inflicted upon their relatives out of fear of reprisal.
By observing the ""traits and actions of the regime"", the group has deduced the biggest faction of society targeted by the Assad government is not the armed rebels - it is journalists and humanitarian workers.
""What we saw in Yarmouk made this quite evident,"" Hosain said. ""Niraz was the one who insisted to show the world the reality on the ground … he believed in what he was doing and considered taking photographs as his duty towards his people.""
Abbassi said Saied will always be remembered for his ""calm and humorous"" character.
""It hurts, so much,"" he said of his friend's death. ""We were living on the hope that we would meet again tomorrow - but unfortunately it turns out that there is no tomorrow.""

After 18 months of negotiations, the draft for the Global Compact for Migration was approved on Friday by 191 UN member nations, but not the United States, which withdrew in December saying it was ""inconsistent"" with its ""immigration and refugee policies"".
Hungary, whose Prime Minister Viktor Orban won a third consecutive term in April on a fiercely anti-migration platform, decided not to sign the final document at a ceremony in Morocco in December.
Peter Szijjarto, Hungary's foreign minister, said on Wednesday that the document is ""entirely against Hungary's security interests"".
""Its main premise is that migration is a good and inevitable phenomenon. We consider migration a bad process, which has extremely serious security implications,"" Szijjarto said after a cabinet meeting in the capital, Budapest.
""Hungary must step out of the approval process, and by doing so, make it clear that in no way does it consider any measure or guideline of the package to be the way forward,"" he added.
Szijjarto said the country's proposals were brushed aside during the debate of the document, which he said mostly favoured the interests of African and Latin American countries.
The text of the new treaty aims to create a worldwide framework for managing migration.
The pact is billed as the first international document on managing migration. It lays out 23 objectives to open up legal migration and better manage flows of people as the number on the move worldwide has increased to about 250 million.
Negotiations faced hurdles over how to address irregular migration, with some governments insisting that migrants who are not properly registered be returned to their countries of origin.
Szijjarto said Hungary did not trust that the pact is ""legally non-binding"" as stated in the document's final version.
During his election campaign, Orban promised to stop the flow of refugees and migrants into Hungary and decried the so-called ""Islamisation"" of Europe.

Blok, a member of the liberal VVD, the largest party in the Netherlands, also said that Suriname has become a failed state because of its ethnic divide.
The minister made the comments during a private event last week, where he met Dutch citizens working for international organisations.
Footage of the speech was obtained by Zembla, a TV programme focused on investigative journalism.
""Give me an example, of a multiethnic or multicultural society, where the original population are still living as well. [...] And where there are peaceful community relations. I'm not aware of any,"" Blok said during the event.
After an audience member mentioned Suriname, a former Dutch colony, Blok disagreed vehemently.
""Suriname peaceful? A functioning rule of law and democracy? Courageous, this remark. So the parties in Suriname are not divided by their ethnicity,"" Blok said.
""I admire your optimism. Suriname is a failed state, and that is mostly due to ethnic division.""
After another audience member gave Singapore as an example, Blok said that is only because of Singapore's strict immigration policy.
""Singapore is indeed a small mini-country, extremely selective in its migration. Extremely selective,"" the FM said.
""It is very difficult to 'get in'. They don't allow any poor migrants in. Well, maybe for cleaning,"" he added.
According to Blok, countries that receive a lot of migrants will run into trouble eventually.
""If you live in Benoordenhout [a neighbourhood in The Hague], it's really great to be able to nip to the Turkish baker on a Sunday,"" Blok said.
""You don’t suffer from any of the side effects [then]. But if you're surrounded by them, you suffer greatly.
""I can't see the difference between a Hutu and a Tutsi, or a Sunni or a Shiite, but unfortunately they do. It has nothing to do with skin colour,"" he added.
Blok said this was all because of human genetics, claiming that people ""don't find it easy to make connections with people who are unfamiliar to us"".
The foreign minister also said the European Union would never get Eastern European countries to accept as many refugees as other EU countries, and that people of colour leave cities like Warsaw only days after arriving because they are beaten and harassed.
Blok's remarks were heavily criticised by Dutch politicians and human rights organisations.
Lilian Ploumen, chairwoman of the social-democratic PvdA party and former minister for foreign trade and development cooperation, said she will ask questions in parliament about Blok's remarks.
Stichting Vluchtelingenwerk, an NGO focused on the rights of refugees, said in a tweet the comments were ""unworthy of a minister"", adding that it welcomed Blok to join in charity work benefiting refugees.
Lilian Marijnissen, leader of the Socialist Party in the Dutch parliament, simply tweeted Blok's name and included a picture of a quote by Nelson Mandela.
#Blok pic.twitter.com/RCqxmdxePj
Green party MP Zihni Ozdil, who is of Turkish descent, said in a post on Facebook that Blok ""not only offends people that look like me, but our whole national history and identity"".
Leader of the far-right PVV party Geert Wilders called Blok ""a weakling"" for apologising for his comments and said he completely agreed with Blok's remarks.
Joel Voordewind, member of parliament for the Christian ChristenUnie party, called the minister's statements ""unfortunate"".
Following the publication of the video, Blok said he was sorry for the remarks he made in a letter addressed to the Dutch parliament.
In the letter, Blok said his comments were merely made ""to provoke"", that his wording was ""too sharp"" and that he ""is sorry if his comments led to anyone being offended.""

More than 200,000 people have fled their homes in the volatile western regions since late last year, in addition to at least 21,000 who have fled into Nigeria, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said on Tuesday.
The regions have been gripped by violence since protests by the mainly Francophone country's Anglophone minority morphed into a secessionist movement last year.
There were no humanitarian agencies in the area before the revolution, and bad roads, travel restrictions and unpredictable attacks have made it difficult for them to go in, said Modibo Traore, the head of OCHA in Cameroon.
Most of the people who have fled clashes are hiding in the woods, he said. Some have bullet wounds but are afraid to venture into urban areas for medical care.
""The people living in the forest are asking for more assistance, saying that conditions are very difficult,"" Traore told the Reuters Thomson Foundation.
""They are sleeping in the open space ... in the middle of the rainy season. Many people couldn't take anything with them.""
OCHA released an emergency response plan in May calling for $15m to provide food, shelter and other necessities to the displaced, but has received no donations so far, he said.
Medical charity Doctors Without Borders, known by its French initials MSF began to set up mobile clinics this month in the southwest region, it said in a statement. The people it treated were lacking adequate shelter, drinking water and food, it said.
Cameroonian authorities could not immediately be reached for comment. The government published its own humanitarian assistance plan last month, and it was not clear whether aid delivery had begun.
""Because media access ... is very limited, we don't have a full grasp of the kind of suffering that people are actually going through,"" Elizabeth Mpimbaza, a spokeswoman for the UN refugee agency in Nigeria said.
Those who fled across the border have also received little humanitarian aid, and are surviving because poor local communities are sharing what they have, Mpimbaza said.
Analysts fear violence could increase ahead of an October election in which President Paul Biya is aiming to extend his 36-year rule.
""I am very worried about the situation,"" said Traore of OCHA. ""Unfortunately we are not expecting any improvement anytime soon.""

Another 90 migrants recovered from the container on Monday were in critical condition and taken to a local hospital for treatment, the security directorate in the town of Zuwarah said in a statement.
Zuwarah is one of the points along Libya's western coastline where smugglers and traffickers hold migrants before putting them on boats to try to cross to Europe.
The migrants were from various sub-Saharan African and Arab countries, as well as Pakistan and Bangladesh, the statement said.
They had been locked inside a refrigerated container designed for transporting meat and fish that was found just outside Zuwarah, close to the Mellitah oil and gas complex, about 110km from the capital, Tripoli.
""As a result of the length of time they suffocated, eight of them died including six children, one woman and a young man,"" the security directorate said.
It posted pictures of at least nine plastic jerry cans holding petrol, as well as a pile of life-jackets apparently intended for use in a boat crossing.
Daytime temperatures in northwest Libya have been in the mid to high 30 degrees Celsius in recent days.
It's the latest migrant tragedy in Libya, where human trafficking and lawlessness has thrived since the 2011 uprising that toppled and killed Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi.
Rival governments based in eastern and western Libya rely on militias to maintain order. However, some armed groups have become involved in human trafficking.
Libya continues to be the main point of departure for asylum seekers attempting to cross the Mediterranean Sea to seek refuge in Europe.
Smugglers and traffickers took advantage of Libya's lawlessness to send hundreds of thousands of migrants to Italy over the past four years, though flows have slowed since last summer because of an Italian-backed crackdown on smuggling networks.
Last month, UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) spokesman Charlie Yaxley noted for the fifth year in a row the ""grim milestone"" of 1,000 migrant deaths in the Mediterranean had been crossed.
According to a 2018 report by Human Rights Watch, boats full of migrants and asylum seekers attempting to cross the sea have been taken back to Libya after being intercepted by the Libyan coastguard, which is trained by the EU and Italy. Upon their return, many were beaten and sexually abused and faced abduction, extortion, harsh detention conditions and forced labour.
More than 400,000 migrants in Libya are exposed to abuse and human rights violations ""as rent-seeking armed groups proliferate and engage in smuggling, trafficking and exploitation of this group"", the International Organisation for Migration noted in a report.

The Associated Press reported that, according to UN International Organization for Migration officials, more than 13,000 people - including women and children - had been dropped off in the desert borders that Algeria shares with Niger and Mali since May 2017.
Under three weeks after the report, the expulsions to the harsh, dangerous region have all but ended.
Before the AP reached out to Algeria for comment and published the report on June 26, the North African nation had been expelling migrants and refugees by the hundreds almost every week into the unforgiving desert, sometimes to their deaths.
Algeria has refused repeated AP requests for comment on the expulsions.
The European Union also declined to comment. The expulsions came as Europe pressured North African governments to head off the migrants before they can cross the Mediterranean Sea.
An aid worker with contacts in Algeria told the AP that the mass detentions continue, but now migrants and refugees, including dozens of pregnant women, are warehoused in overcrowded jails. The worker requested anonymity to avoid retribution from the Algerian government.
Algeria also continues to deport migrants and refugees from neighbouring Niger, with which it has had an expulsion agreement since 2015. But while migrants and refugees from other sub-Saharan countries were secretly released in the desert and forced to walk for miles under the blistering sun, the Nigeriens have long been driven to the border by convoys.
After the AP report in June, Algerian officials invited local media to watch such a round of deportations to prove they were humanely done.
Since the report, Algeria's security forces have fallen into disarray, with the head of the gendarmerie and the chief of national security both being forced from their jobs. It is unclear why the men were fired, but both were linked to the migrant and refugee expulsions in the desert, as well as to an unrelated corruption scandal involving the seizure of more than 700 kilograms of cocaine from a cargo ship in May.
In its few public statements, Algeria has insisted that migrants and refugees are treated appropriately, but the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights has condemned the expulsions in the desert. Two days after the AP report, Human Rights Watch also released an investigation into the forced desert marches.
""Algeria has the power to control its borders, but that doesn't mean it can round up people based on the colour of their skin and dump them in the desert, regardless of their legal status and without a shred of due process,"" Sarah Leah Whitson of Human Rights Watch said in a statement.
Migrants filmed videos of themselves fanning out across the open desert, stumbling through heat that reaches above 50 degrees Celsius in the summer as armed Algerian gendarmes ensured they did not turn back. Of the more than two dozen migrants who AP journalists interviewed in Niger, nearly all reported seeing deaths during the forced march, which sometimes lasted days.
Even before the AP report, the conditions migrants were enduring in the Sahara Desert had been an open secret among aid workers, as well as governments in Africa and Europe. The African Union had complained about Algeria's policies towards migrants in a statement in May.
""We cannot accept African countries ill-treating Africans, even if they enter the country illegally,"" the chairman of the AU Commission, Moussa Faki Mahamat, said this week in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.
European Union officials say they discussed the desert expulsions with Algerian government officials privately in recent months, but the EU nonetheless settled upon Algeria as one of a handful of countries where it had hoped to set up centres to sort economic migrants from asylum seekers fleeing for their lives. Algeria has refused the dubious honour, as did multiple other countries.

The 23-year-old committed suicide at a hotel in the Afghan capital, Kabul, on Tuesday after being forcibly returned on July 4 along with 68 others, an Afghan official said.
A German interior ministry confirmed the news at a regular news conference saying: ""We received confirmation from the Afghan authorities today morning that one of the passengers on the repatriation flight was found dead in accommodation in Kabul.
""According to the Afghan authorities, it was a suicide.""
On Tuesday, German Interior Minister Horst Seehofer appeared to joke that the 69 deported Afghans were a birthday present.
""Just on my 69th birthday - and I didn't request it - 69 people were sent back to Afghanistan,"" he said with a raised smile on his face.
""That's way above earlier levels.""

In recent years, thousands of Afghan asylum seekers have been told they will be deported back to the active warzone despite outcrys that the country is not safe.
The repatriations have sparked a wave of protests at airports with signs reading: ""Don't send people back to die"".
Late last year, several pilots reportedly joined the movement and refused to fly planes deporting asylum seekers.
It comes as anti-immigrant sentiment has risen in the country with groups such as the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) winning support as they blame security and economic woes on refugees.

Los Angeles US District Court Judge Dolly Gee dismissed as ""dubious"" and ""unconvincing"" the US Justice Department's arguments to modify the 1997 Flores settlement that says children can only be held in immigration detention for up to 20 days.
The government made the request in June to allow it to keep underage migrants and refugees in detention alongside parents, after a public outcry over its tactic of separating children from parents who entered the United States in between official ports of entry.
""It is apparent that the Defendants' Application is a cynical attempt to shift responsibility to the Judiciary for over 20 years of Congressional inaction and ill-considered Executive action that have led to the current stalemate,"" Gee, the daughter of Chinese immigrants, said in her ruling on Monday.
The government asked Gee to suspend the Flores settlement's requirement that immigrant children be held only in facilities that meet state child welfare licensing regulations, so as to allow whole families to be detained together.
Gee, who was appointed to the bench by President Barack Obama, said the government had known for years that there was ""no state licensing readily available for facilities that house both adults and children"".
The Trump administration has come under widespread criticism for its ""zero tolerance"" towards immigrants and refugees.
It is estimated that more than 2,000 children remain in detention and separated from their families.
One asylum seeker from Brazil, who spoke to Al Jazeera last week, said it had been more than a month since she had seen her son, after being separated while crossing the border in May.
There have been other reports of parents being deported to their home countries without their children.
Last month, a judge in California ordered the US government to reunite parents with children under the age of five by July 10, and all other children by July 26.
But on Monday, a government lawyer said only about half of 100 immigrant and refugee children under age five will be reunited with their parents by Tuesday's deadline.
At a court hearing, Justice Department lawyer Sarah Fabian said 54 children younger than five would be reunited with parents by the end of Tuesday, and the number could increase depending on background checks.
Fabian acknowledged the government wouldn't meet the deadline for all the children, citing a variety of reasons, including that the parents of some of the youngsters had already been deported.
She told the judge that once parents and children were reunited, they would likely be released from immigration custody.
The judge directed the government to file a detailed accounting of the reunification process and scheduled a hearing for Tuesday at 11am (18:00 GMT).
Lee Gelernt, a lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union, which brought the case, said he did not think the government was complying with the reunification order.
""It is very troubling that there are children and parents who are not in some kind of government tracking system,"" he said after the court hearing. He added that nonprofit groups were trying to find parents the government had failed to locate, who are mostly from El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras.
He also questioned if the government's list of children under the age of 5 was accurate.
It's extremely disappointing the government will not be in full compliance with the court order by tomorrow, but the most important thing is that the court will continue to hold the administration's feet to the fire to get these kids reunited with their parents.
Gelernt added, however, that he believed the government had made ""significant"" steps in the past 48 hours to unite parents with their children, and he called the effort ""a blueprint for going forward with the remaining more than 2,000 families"".
Gelernt said the ACLU was concerned that parents would be put on the street without any money in an unfamiliar city.
The organisation and government agreed that the locations of the releases would not be disclosed, and the government agreed to work with immigration advocates to ensure the parents had money for a hotel and other necessities.

The UN human rights office (OHCHR) and the UN Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS) jointly published a report on Tuesday, documenting at least 232 civilian deaths and many more injuries between April 16 and May 24 in attacks by government-backed troops as well as armed youth on 40 villages in the opposition-held areas of Mayendit and Leer.
""The perpetrators of these revolting acts against defenceless civilians, including those bearing command responsibility, must not be allowed to get away with it,"" Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein, the UN high commissioner for human rights, said in a statement, calling on the government to halt all hostilities against civilians.
In its report, the UN human rights office identified three individuals who ""may bear the greatest responsibility"" for the recent violations.
OHCHR said: ""Civilians were targeted, with the elderly, people with disabilities and very young children killed in horrific acts of violence - some hung from trees and others burned alive in their homes.""
Zeid called on the perpetrators of these ""horrific crimes"" to be held accountable and demanded justice for the victims.
""There must be consequences for the men who reportedly gang-raped a six-year-old child, who slit the throats of elderly villagers, who hanged women for resisting looting, and shot fleeing civilians in the swamps where they hid,"" he said.
At least 120 women and girls were raped or gang-raped, with one woman still bleeding from childbirth when she was assaulted, the report said. At least 132 other women and girls were also abducted.
There has not been any reaction to the report from the South Sudanese government.
The UN report said opposition forces had also carried out armed attacks that caused civilian casualties.
South Sudan rebels on Monday rejected a peace plan to reinstate their leader Riek Machar as vice president, under a deal reached at talks in Uganda.
They said it failed to dilute the strong power base of the country's president.
South Sudan is reeling from the effects of a four-and-a-half year civil war, which has killed tens of thousands, pushed millions to the brink of famine and created Africa's largest refugee crisis since the 1994 Rwandan genocide.
A ""permanent"" ceasefire was agreed upon by the two warring sides - led by President Salva Kiir and Riek Machar - last month, raising hopes of peace to end the country's devastating war that dates back to December 2013.
South Sudan's civil war broke out in December 2013 when Kiir accused his then-deputy Machar of plotting a coup, dashing the optimism that accompanied independence from Sudan just two years earlier.
Multiple attempts at peace deals have failed in the past leaving long-suffering citizens wondering whether this latest attempt at peace would fall apart as well.

Clad in a black uniform and flanked by army commanders and heads of security forces that were involved in a ferocious, nine-month long battle against ISIL, al-Abadi confirmed the ""failure of the terrorist state of falsehood and terrorism"" in a reference to the group's 2014 takeover of Iraq's second city and declaration of a caliph state.
""From here, from the heart of the free and liberated Mosul, by the sacrifices of the Iraqis from all the provinces, we announce the awaited victory to all of Iraq, and the Iraqis,"" the prime minister said.
Yet the battle was far from over, and Abadi warned that Mosul would face a series of challenges in the aftermath, relating especially to stability and reconstruction as well as clearing ISIL cells and reuniting the tattered social fabric of a once pluralistic and diverse city that counted Sunnis, Shia Muslims, Turkmen, Kurds and Shabak as its residents.
Twelve months on, Mosul's residents are still struggling to rebuild their lives in a city devastated by wide-scale destruction that has decimated its infrastructure and left its economy in tatters.
In terms of reparation, little has been done regarding the damaged services and buildings following a massive military operation waged by a collective of Iraqi government units, Kurdish Peshmerga fighters and Shia militias, with air and ground support provided by a US-led coalition.
According to the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC), $874m is required to repair the basic infrastructure in the city, which is afflicted with eight million tonnes of unmoved debris.
Furthermore, 54,000 houses in and around Mosul were destroyed, and hundreds of thousands of people, almost 64,000 families, were displaced and remain in camps. A total of 62 schools are completely destroyed and 207 damaged.
The Old City, which lies on the west side of Mosul, was where the ISIL fighters were concentrated and hence, where the heaviest fighting took place.
The fierce fighting left entire neighbourhoods flattened, and today the Old City remains uninhabitable, with more than 3,000 houses, schools and shops destroyed. It is also one of the last areas without running water.
According to international charity Oxfam, the complete obliteration of parts of the city inevitably means that rebuilding will take some time.
""We must not just rebuild what was there before - we have to do better than that,"" said Andres Gonzalez, Oxfam's country director in Iraq.
""We need to prioritise the most vulnerable people who lost everything in the battle against ISIS, young people who missed out on years of education, and women and men whose freedom was severely curtailed.""
Mohammed Masoud, a 30-year-old student at Mosul University, told Al Jazeera that he belongs to one of the youth-organised volunteer groups that set to work clearing rubble and booby-traps on campus and in the city's streets in the immediate aftermath of ISIL's defeat.
""We as youth believe in the importance of our role in rebuilding this city more than ever, but we need lots of support,"" he said.
The university, an institution renowned for its high standards before ISIL's takeover, is but a shadow of itself now, added Masoud.
""The campus doors have managed to stay open after the university was mostly closed during the three years ISIL was in power, and there is regular attendance where thousands of students have returned, but there is no hiding the fact that entire department buildings have been decimated,"" Masoud said.
Some 30,000 books in the main library, which used to hold around one million, were burned by ISIL, he continued, and the university still suffers from lack of electricity, air conditioning and basic supplies. Yet while the university is functioning, the future of the students remains bleak, with 80 percent of youth unable to find jobs, according to NRC.
In the city itself, the health sector has been severely affected - up to 90 percent of it destroyed. Where there used to be 10 hospitals, there is now only one that services Mosul's population of 2.5 million, forcing people to travel to other areas across Iraq for treatment.
Still, Masoud is optimistic his hometown will flourish again, even if it takes some time.
""With our willpower and resolve of Mosul's residents, life is returning to the city,"" he said.
""We want to live normally, with schools open and police to keep order. The city is slowly recovering and coming out of a war - the same of which can be said of the role of the government, which is understandably weak and cannot cover the demands of the city.""
""The situation will not remain the way it is currently but will improve for the better,"" he added.
But others like Gmela Obaidy, a member of the Iraqi parliament, are not as hopeful.
""Unfortunately, the government role in the Nineveh province is almost non-existent,"" Obaidy told Al Jazeera, adding that the Old City resembles a site from World War II.
""The local government here is overworked and overstretched; the local police force is still suspended; and we still haven't seen any compensation for families who lost their homes, many of whom remain in displacement camps.""
There are no basic services available despite the best intentions of the local councils in the province, she added, and while the economy lies in ruins, the loans and aid packages given to the central government by the international community is greatly insufficient.
And while the scarcity of fuel and electricity is a major issue, Obaidy said the abductions of men, women and children by unknown groups - some targeted for being relatives of ISIL fighters - is the most important cause for concern.
""These arrests, or kidnappings, are completely unaccounted for,"" she said. ""This only cements chaos in the province, with potential far-reaching consequences. Law and order has not made it back to this province.""
While she praised the resilience of local councils in the absence of what she called the central government's lethargic response, Obaidy said that she has ""no hope"" for the future, particularly after the last general election which took place on May 12.
The Supreme Court has since ordered a manual recount of ballot boxes following allegations of fraud count from de-seated MPs.
""There were attempts by myself and fellow parliamentarians to postpone the election campaign to give time for territories that were occupied by ISIL more preparation,"" Obaidy said.
""How can voting happen when we have displaced people, citizens who lost their government ID cards and unable to vote, and a general untenable situation?""
Younis Daoud, head of the engineering department at Mosul University, said that it was difficult to describe the mass scale level of destruction in Mosul, and that the efforts to rebuild the city were daunting.
""The Nineveh province needs a committee to rebuild not just the physical nature of the city but on the psychological level too, to heal people of their trauma and bring back their cohesion,"" he told Al Jazeera.
""There has to be a concentrated effort from the regional and international countries to support and fund the rehabilitation of Mosul, and to bring Iraq's economy back from the ruins.""
Daoud said that the Iraqi government has shown on more than one occasion its ineptitude to bear the brunt of reconstruction alone.
""We expect international organisations to play their part in helping to rebuild some of the liberated territories, and in conjunction with the Nineveh Provincial Reconstruction Advisory Group to assist in restoring the fields of health and education, municipal services, running water and sewage, building roads and bridges.""
The head of the Ninevah Reconstruction Advisory Group, Mazahim al-Khayat, placed a 10-year plan to rebuild the city, but the blueprint is riddled with holes and obstacles mainly, Daoud said, due to international financial aid coming in drips and being nowhere near the cost of reconstruction.
""We need a lot of external help,"" Daoud said. ""At the same time we need to form committees based on coexistence to preserve the society and heal the wounds.""
""Now, the Old City resembles Hiroshima, and there are still bodies somewhere under the rubble. There are no official stats on how many civilian were killed in the battle for Mosul, but every home has suffered a loss.""

It was only a few years ago when a steady stream of goods and people moved through the Nasib-Jaber crossing, a major commercial artery connecting Syria, Turkey and Lebanon in the north to Jordan, Egypt and the Gulf states in the south.
Inside its free trade zone, transit companies and industries were allowed to set up shop under favourable terms. A wide array of restaurants and shops meanwhile welcomed merchants and drivers making brief stops before loading their cargo onto one of the hundreds of trucks passing through the border daily.
But Syria's devastating war put an end to this bustling activity. In 2015, the takeover of the crossing by rebels prompted Jordan to shut it down, refusing to deal with a non-state actor. Amman sealed the border altogether a year later after a deadly car bomb attack at an army post near Rukban camp.
This shutdown, however, might soon be reversed.
On June 19, Syrian government troops backed by Russian air power launched a fierce offensive in the southwestern province of Deraa with the aim of re-taking an area held by rebels for several years. After more than two weeks of being battered, the opposition fighters eventually reached a ceasefire agreement with the government on Friday.
Under the deal, the rebels agreed to give up the crossing and hand over their heavy weapons, allowing Russian military police to deploy along the Jordanian border.
Hours after the deal was struck, Syrian forces reached the border crossing for the first time in years and re-took control.
In Jordan, a country bogged down by persistent financial woes and the influx of hundreds of thousands of refugees since the start of the Syrian war in 2011, the seizure raised hopes, especially among residents in northern towns, that the border crossing would re-open soon and boost the country's flailing economy by allowing commerce to flow once again.
""People here hope the borders would re-open,"" Ameen al-Harfoshy, a taxi driver in the Jaber-Sarhan area, told Al Jazeera.
""When there was land shipping and taxis [moving back-and-forth], everyone was working and making money. It [the crossing] was this village's source of income.""
Before the war, Jordan's Investment Commission handled $1.5bn worth of trade every year. By 2014, that sum had dropped to $400m and now amounts to zero.
In 2016, Jordan received a $723m loan from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and put in place a plan to bring down its high debt level.
Amid growing anger over austerity measures, the rising cost of living and unemployment, the economy has been further strained by the border closure, which has resulted in long delays in shipping and added customs duties.
""Shipping and trading routes have had to change, whereby cargo - which used to be transported by land - is being transported by sea,"" Nadia Shahin, general manager of Amin Kawar Shipping, Jordan's leading shipping provider, told Al Jazeera.
""[Because of the closures], cargo [traditionally] going through Nasib has been forced to go by sea, which has added major financial burdens because of the extra costs and considerable extra time,"" she said, adding that the port of Aqaba has been used as an alternative shipping route.
Salameh Darawi, an economic analyst, said the geopolitical and military developments of recent years hurt Jordan's trade with neighbouring Syria, resulting in both countries losing much-needed revenue.
""The crossings were used for tourism between Jordan and Syria, as well of a lot of investment back-and-forth,"" said Darawi.
""In the years before the war, trade with Syria was about $500m annually. The closure of the crossing has lost them that.""
One of the world's top refugee-hosting countries relative to its size, Jordan is home to about 650,000 Syrian refugees, according to the UN. The Jordanian government estimates the figure is double that.
Before Friday's ceasefire deal, which saw most of the 60,000 fleeing Syrians who sought shelter along the northern Jordanian northern border returning home, Jordan refused to open its doors.
Ayman Safadi, Jordan's foreign minister, wrote last month on Twitter that Jordan is ""at capacity... we can't host more"".
According to Labib Kamhawi, a Jordanian political analyst, the influx of refugees has aggravated Jordan's economic problems and informed Amman's decision to keep its borders shut.
""We have meagre resources and the fact that the government is almost bankrupt means that it cannot invest into developing the infrastructure,"" said Kamhawi.
""Jordanians have to share this weak infrastructure with hundreds of thousands of refugees,"" he added.
While Jordan's economy as a whole has been affected by the closure, the country's northern towns and villages have been hit the hardest, residents say.
""We've lost our income,"" Hajj Nader, the owner of a travel company in Jordan's Zarqa province, which employed hundreds of drivers transporting people and cargo along the route, told Al Jazeera.
""We used to do 1,200 journeys every day. There hasn't been a single one since [the borders were closed].""
The closure has also meant a complete shutdown for the free trade zone.
""Restaurants and coffee shops here [in the free trade zone] ... are now all closed,"" al-Harfoshy told Al Jazeera.
""All these people [who worked there] are now unemployed and just sitting at home.""
Even though many locals are optimistic that the border crossing will re-open soon, it is difficult to say when.
""Now that the Syrian government has taken over the crossing, we hope it will be reopened and cars will go back to moving between those areas again,"" said Nader.
""We can return to having an income and our economy and households will flourish again."""
https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/07/beaten-kidnapped-detained-rohingya-abused-decades-180708051959731.html,refugee,974,Sun Jul 08 2018 19:01:55 GMT+0000,Mohammed Jamjoom,'We want peace': A Rohingya family's 40 years of suffering ,"Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh - Gul Zahar is the head of four generations of family and the bearer of 40 years of suffering. A Rohingya refugee in her 90s, she has fled persecution in Myanmar on three separate occasions in her life: first in 1978, then in 1991 and, finally, in 2017.
Like many other Rohingya members of her generation, Gul isn't exactly sure how old she is. And while she readily admits her advanced age may keep her from remembering everything, Gul also insists she'll never forget the constant horrors she says her family suffered at the hands of security forces in Myanmar over the decades.
Inside the hut she now calls home, Gul, who is remarkably alert, speaks softly and slowly.
""They beat us,"" says Gul in a voice so low it almost belies the brutality she is describing. ""They kidnapped us. They detained us.""
""We struggled with everyday life, earning a living and moving around,"" explains Gul before going quiet. As her eyes begin to drift, a pained expression appears on her face - as though Gul had suddenly been confronted with more details of a past she wished had never come back into focus.
Asked if she wishes to return home, she says simply: ""I want to die where there is peace. I want to die where my parents died.""
Bonded through blood and displacement, they now all live in a single, small dwelling constructed out of bamboo and tarpaulin; the kind of makeshift shelter that, by all appearances, seems unlikely to be able to withstand the pounding rains this current monsoon season will bring.
Gul and the rest of her family members residing here at the Kutupalong Camp in Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh - including her son, daughter-in-law, grandchildren, great-grandchildren and more - span almost a century in age.
The last military crackdown started on Aug 25, 2017, when an armed Rohingya group attacked military posts in Myanmar's Rakhine State.
In retaliation, the Myanmar military is reported to have burned dozens of Rohingya villages and fired indiscriminately at unarmed men, women and children.
Myanmar's army has denied the reports of atrocities against Rohingya.
Gul's son, Oli Ahmed, first fled Rakhine State with his family as a teenager.
Now 53, Oli's demeanour is both kind and stern. Speaking outside his family's hut, he wears the kind of protected expression that can only be learned from a life of having seen too much misery and experienced too much injustice.
Under grey clouds that threaten rain at any minute, Oli recalls the sheer terror of what happened when Myanmar's military descended upon them last year.
""They set the village ablaze,"" says Oli, ""firing on people, killing people. They cut people. They slaughtered people. And we escaped out of fear.""
When Oli speaks, he does so matter-of-factly, in a manner seemingly devoid of emotion. But his words convey the kind of dread most people would have trouble processing, let alone understanding.
""If we couldn't have made our way here,"" he says, ""we would have been killed like stray dogs.""
Oli explains how, throughout his life, the Rohingya haven't been bestowed even the most basic rights and freedoms.
""Our movement was restricted,"" he says. ""There was a curfew from 6pm to 6am. And a ban on people gathering. And a ban on religious practices. If they saw people gather outside, either they disappeared them or killed them. There was no peace.""
He then adds: ""We want peace … We want to be granted Rohingya citizenship"".
Learning more about this particular family, it becomes clear their experiences - both inside and outside Myanmar - mirror what's happened to so many other Rohingya.
Having faced decades of repression and abuse, the Rohingya aren't just the world's largest group of stateless people, they're also among the world's most persecuted minorities.
The United Nations has called Myanmar's military operations against the mostly Muslim Rohingya in Rakhine State in 2017 a ""textbook example of ethnic cleansing"".
As a result, more than 700,000 Rohingya have fled Myanmar – a situation that's become one of the world's fastest-growing refugee crises in decades.
During a visit to Bangladesh last week to highlight the plight of the Rohingya, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres described the Rohingya as, ""one of the most discriminated against and vulnerable communities on earth,"" and called the Rohingya refugee crisis, ""a humanitarian and human rights nightmare"".
Upon completing his tour of Kutupalong Camp, Guterres urged the international community to do more to help, adding how, ""nothing could have prepared me for the scale of the crisis and extent of suffering"".
Mohammad Ayub,31, is Gul's grandson-in-law and father to her great-grandchildren. Voluble and expressive, when Mohammad talks, the outrage is audible in his voice and the anger is visible on his face.
He says he'll always be haunted by the crimes he witnessed security forces commit back home.
""They were grabbing people and shooting them,"" describes Mohammad as he winces. ""And in some cases, they would beat them to death with the butt of their guns.""
Mohammad struggles as much with the grief over family members who were killed as he does over the friends and relatives who went missing.
""Nobody could even ask questions about the forced disappearances,"" says Mohammad. ""Even a brother didn't have the right to ask about his missing brother. You understand? We had no clue who was disappeared and to where. We just had to remain silent about it.""
More than anything, Mohammad wants his children to be granted citizenship and to experience the kind of peace and justice he's never known. He says there's only one way that can happen.
""Atrocities that have been committed against our men and women should be heard by the International Criminal Court so that we get justice,"" says Mohammad.
""And if it's not, we won't be satisfied.""

Opposition activists said on Sunday that Syrian government air raids targeted a group of rebel fighters in Um al-Mayadin village, just 5km north of the Jordanian border, killing at least four people.
The ceasefire deal - brokered by Russia, a Syrian government ally, on Friday - saw rebels agree to hand over heavy weapons in exchange for security guarantees and safe passage to other areas.
Rebels in Um al-Mayadin refused to give up their arms, a source in Deraa province told Al Jazeera. They accused Moscow of not abiding by the agreement. It was not clear which part of the deal they referred to.
Under the agreement, Russian military police were to be deployed in the Deraa areas previously held by rebels.
It was also agreed that Syrian government forces were to withdraw from four villages in eastern Deraa: Kahil, al-Sahwa, al-Jiza and al-Misaifra. As of Sunday, the Syrian forces had not pulled out of the villages.
Meanwhile, in the western suburbs of Deraa province, clashes between the Syrian army and rebels opposed to the truce deal intensified on Sunday, according to the source inside Syria.
Rebels in Deraa's western areas have formed what they call ""the Southern Army"", a group of 11 rebel factions, according to a statement they issued on social media on Sunday.
""We call on all factions in the south to join our army in defending our land and dignity,"" it said in a statement.
According to the United Nations, the Syrian government's southern offensive uprooted more than 320,000 people over the past two weeks, including about 60,000 who sought shelter to areas near the border with Jordan.
Less than 48 hours since the truce deal was reached, almost all displaced Syrians at the Nassib-Jaber crossing had left the Jordanian border and returned to areas in southern Syria, according to Anders Pedersen, the UN resident and humanitarian coordinator in Jordan.
""We have a very low number of people that are still there [near the Jaber-Nasib crossing]. They are only about 150-200 people at the border in the free-trade zone,"" Pedersen told reporters in Jordan's capital, Amman, on Sunday.
""As far as we understand, they are almost exclusively men,"" he said.
Still, there is little information about the tens of thousands of others who headed to the frontier with the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights in search of safety.
""While we know that most families along Jordan's northern borders have returned home, we do not have information about the tens of thousands of families who were based along the Golan Heights,"" Rula Amin, Middle East and North Africa spokeswoman for the the UN's refugee agency, told Al Jazeera on Sunday.
UN officials say aid delivery in southwest Syria has been impeded since June 27 due to the security vacuum in the area.
""We keep repeating our appeal to the partners of the conflict on the ground - please allow us access,"" said Pedersen.
""As the UN in Jordan, we have been on standby, ready to go as soon as the necessary approvals are in place to do so.""

Benjamin Ladraa, 25, began his journey on August 5, 2017 to raise awareness of Israel's 70-year occupation of Palestine.
But early on Friday, Israeli officials denied him entry at the Allenby crossing which links Jordan to the occupied West Bank.
Ladraa was just hundreds of metres from his destination after walking more than 4,800km from the Swedish city of Gothenburg and across mainland Europe.
""I spent 11 months making this journey to raise awareness of the occupation, and despite being interrogated and denied entry I would do it all again,"" he told Al Jazeera.
Walking for between eight and 10 hours a day, Ladraa crossed a total of 13 countries by foot on the same routes used by refugees and migrants.
Forced to sleep in abandoned buildings and brave harsh winter weather conditions, his journey saw him garner more than 18,000 followers on Instagram and more than 20,000 on Facebook.
""I've managed to reach thousands of people through this campaign and hopefully raise further awareness of the suffering of the Palestinian people,"" he said.
Benjamin Ladraa
Ladraa said Israeli officers interrogated him for six hours and suggested he would not be allowed in because ""he was lying"".
""They gave two reasons for rejecting my entry. First, they accused me of lying, the other was they claimed I was coming to orchestrate protests in Nabi Saleh village [near Ramallah], something which is completely untrue.""
For several years, Israel has attempted to block activists who support the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement, which leads a nonviolent campaign aimed at pressuring Israel to adhere to international law.
Last year, the right-wing government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu amended its entry law allowing Israeli authorities to deny entry visas to activists who support BDS or oppose illegal settlements.
""Israel has a long history of rejecting Palestinians and activists at the border, so I was not surprised they denied me entry,"" Ladraa said.
""They have a lot to hide and know what impact human rights activists can have. Last week they prevented [BDS activist] Ariel Gold from coming in ... they're scared of the role we play in exposing Israel and working towards a free Palestine.""
Ladraa said while he was interrogated at the crossing, he was subject to a torrent of abuse by Israeli officials who questioned his reasons for making the journey.
""The officials were working on information given to them by the Jordanians. They would change their tone during the interrogation. One minute they would be polite, the next they would be harsh and aggressive.""
The Swedish musician said the experience reminded him of his travels through Eastern Europe where locals would wrongly report him to police for being a refugee and where he was attacked for carrying a large Palestinian flag.
One of the highlights of his trip was his detention in Austria. Ladraa said he was picked up by guards at the Israeli embassy in Vienna because of his flag and trolley.
On hearing of his ordeal, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas granted Ladraa citizenship on Friday and bestowed on him the Medal of Merit.
Palestinian Liberation Organisation (PLO) Executive Committee Member Hanan Ashrawi said Ladraa's support for the Palestinian cause ""represents the conscience of humanity"".
""On behalf of the Palestinian leadership and people of Palestine, we extend our deep gratitude to Ladraa,
""He has demonstrated exceptional courage and integrity by advocating on behalf of the Palestinian people and educating the international community about Israel's persistent violations and acts of aggression against Palestinian lives, lands and resources.""

The movement of the vehicles indicated that the strategically important area, held for years by rebels, was now under the control of pro-Syrian government forces.
Hours earlier, opposition fighters battling a fierce government-led offensive in southern Syria's Deraa province had reached an agreement with negotiators from Russia, a major ally of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.
Under the deal, rebels agreed to hand over their heavy weapons. In exchange, the Syrian army agreed to leave four villages - Kahil, al-Sahwa, al-Jiza and al-Misaifra - in eastern Deraa, sources told Al Jazeera.
Fighters opposed to the deal will now be given safe passage to rebel-held areas in northern Syria. As a result, Free Syrian Army (FSA) fighters and their families are expected to head to the northern province of Idlib and a small area under rebel control near the Golan Heights. The details of this passage are expected to be discussed in the coming weeks.
Under the agreement, Syrian forces will not be allowed to remain in the area re-taken by the government, sources told Al Jazeera.
Instead, Russian military police will be deployed along the border with Jordan, securing the towns and villages covered by the deal. The strategic Nasib crossing will be under the management of Syrian government civilian employees and Russian military police.
The presence of Russian military police is key to the agreement and the assurances given to rebels and civilians.
It is also one of the main concessions gained by neighbouring Jordan, which is fearful that Shia militias fighting alongside government forces will gain control of the area on its northern border.
These concessions will potentially allow tens of thousands of displaced Syrians along the Jordanian border to return to their homes as many currently fear being targeted by government forces.
According to the UN's refugee agency, UNHCR, 60,000 of the more than 320,000 people who have fled the intense fighting since June 19 have been stationed along the border with Jordan. The rest have sought shelter at the frontier with the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights.
There was no immediate comment from the Assad government and its Russian backers. But taking over the Nasib crossing is a major victory for the Syrian government, which wants to re-open the border crossing as a significant trade route. It would also potentially allow the Syrian army to drive further southwards through the area immediately east of Deraa city, where rebel territory narrows to a thin corridor along the Jordanian border. This would split the territory in two.
Friday's agreement came a day after Jordan, which hosts more than 1.4 million Syrian refugees and has closed its northern border, said it had managed to convince the Syrian opposition and the Russians to meet again.
But the announcement only came after an earlier government advance towards the Nasib crossing, sources on the ground said.
Commenting on the negotiations, Jumana Ghunaimat, spokeswoman for the Jordanian government, told Al Jazeera: ""The solution in Syria is political, not military. The war and more fighting won't stop the struggles of the Syrian people.""
Ghunaimat added: ""We need to stop the war, and that is the main goal of negotiations which we are mediating.""
According to the rebels, Moscow had previously rejected their demands for a phased surrender of their heavy weaponry and safe passage to opposition territory elsewhere for rebels and civilians who did not want to live under government rule.

""Displaced Syrians along the Jordanian borders have begun returning to their homes,"" Ouda Shudaifat, a colonel in the Jordanian military, told Al Jazeera on Saturday.
He did not give the exact figure of people moving back to Syria's southwestern province of Deraa, while sources at the border said they were a few.
Sources inside Syria said families began their journey overnight following Friday's truce agreement between rebels fighting the government-led offensive and negotiators from Russia, a major ally of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.
According to the UN's refugee agency, UNHCR, 60,000 of the more than 320,000 people who escaped the intense battles since the launch of the push of June 19 are stationed along the border with Jordan. The rest are at the frontier with the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights.
It remains unclear where in Deraa province the first families are heading to.
Still, Jordan, which has kept its borders shut, hopes the rest of the displaced Syrians will feel safe enough to return to their homes in the coming days.
Under Friday's deal, rebels agreed to hand over their heavy arms. In exchange, the Syrian military agreed to withdraw from four villages in eastern Deraa: Kahil, al-Sahwa, al-Jiza and al-Misaifra.
Fighters opposed to the agreement will be given safe passage to rebel-held areas, in the northern province of Idlib and a small area under rebel control near the Golan Heights. The details of this movement are expected to be discussed in the coming weeks.
Under the Russian-brokered agreement, Syrian forces will not be allowed to remain in the area retaken by the government, sources told Al Jazeera.
With the displaced families fearing reprisal from forces loyal to the Assad government, key to their return is the deployment of Russian military police in the area - part of the assurances package agreed on Friday.
This deployment is one of the main concessions gained by Jordan, which is fearful that Shia militias fighting alongside government forces will gain control of the area on its northern border.
Despite the agreement, Syrian army reinforcements were spotted moving up and down the road towards the Jaber-Nasib border crossing, where the situation remained calm on Saturday.
Fayez al-Duwairi, a military analyst, said he expects to see larger numbers returning to their homes inside Syria only if the agreement is strictly followed.
""If people are given safe passage and rebels hand over their weapons, we will see more displaced Syrians return to their homes,"" he told Al Jazeera.
""It all depends on whether the various aspects of the truce agreement are applied.""

On June 19, forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad and his military ally, Russia, launched a fierce offensive against rebels in southern Syria's Deraa province.
The assault has pushed more than 320,000 people to flee their homes, with nearly 60,000 of those massing along Jordan's northern borders. Despite increasing international pressure to reverse its policy, Amman has refused to open its borders for the refugees. It says a combination of security threats and economic limitations stand behind its decision.
While many Jordanians feel their government's decision makes sense, they cannot bear to see the sight of children locked behind closed borders.
""I am a mother; I hate to see children suffering. We could be in their place any day and would want the help of our neighbours,"" said Effat Ahmad, a 27-year-old pharmacist.
Jordan has two main concerns that have informed its decision to keep its borders with Syria shut; a new wave of refugees, which Amman says it does not have the capacity to accommodate, and security threats.
According to Jumana Ghunaimat, spokesperson for the Jordanian government, security top those concerns, especially since the government says it has reason to believe that armed groups linked to the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL, also known as ISIS) group are present in southern Syria.
""It is not an easy decision to close our borders in the face of our brothers, but we have to prioritise security,"" said Ghunaimat.
""There is a direct threat to Jordan from terrorist [in southern Syria]. We can't risk opening our borders,"" she told Al Jazeera.
Since a suicide attack on a Jordanian army base in the Rukban camp killed seven people in 2016, Jordan's concerns over developments in southern Syria have increased.
The attack also highlighted a problem of a security vacuum existing along Jordan's northern borders.
In addition to security concerns, Ghunaimat also pointed towards limitations in Jordan's capacity to host more refugees, stressing that the small kingdom is already home to at least 650,000 refugees from Syria.
""Jordan has dealt with seven years of refugees and we've always supported Syrians, which has cost us a lot,"" said Ghunaimat. ""But, we currently don't have the capacity for it.
""It is better for Syrians to stay in their homes while we try to provide them with aid they need.""
Despite closing its borders, however, Jordan has been the main source of aid to displaced Syrians in the south, with the military providing medical assistance in a tent hospital along the border and supervising the delivery of hundreds of truck-loads of locally donated support.
But Jordan has felt alone in these efforts, with the international community, including the UNHCR refugee agency, saying that the security vacuum in southern Syria has prevented it from delivering aid.
""For the past 10 days, our trucks have been waiting at the borders because it is unsafe for them to cross while the fighting is happening,"" Rula Amin, spokeswoman for the UNHCR's Middle East and North African division told Al Jazeera.
""We appreciate Jordan's generosity but the risk to the lives of the [Syrian] people is high. That's why have urged Jordan to reopen its borders,"" she added.
Responding to these calls, Jordan says that the international community has previously only partially supported Amman by ""helping with only 50 percent of those costs"" of hosting Syrian refugees, according to Ghunaimat.
In addition to the Syrians, more than two million Palestinian refugees live in Jordan. Earlier this year, the US government announced that it was cutting its funding to the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees by more than half.
Jordan has, therefore, been heavily engaged in mediation talks between the warring parties, which led to a successful ceasefire truce and an end to violence on Friday. Amman now hopes the agreement to stop the fighting would see the situation on those borders stablilised.
Jordanians are divided on the issue of keeping the borders shut.
Bassam Arafa, a 50-year-old shop owner in downtown Amman told Al Jazeera: ""We have to keep our borders closed. We already have enough to deal with here.
""For their own sake, we should keep up pressure on Syria and Russia to allow them back to their lands and their homes, rather than become refugees.
Sharaf al-Ramadan, 24, agreed: ""Security-wise it makes sense to keep our borders shut. We can help them by providing the aid they need.""
According to Jordanian analyst Fahd Khaytan, public opinion geared towards keeping the borders shut has also been informed by the country's current economic struggles.
""There is a limited amount of drinking water in Jordan, which the government is struggling to provide for its own people,"" said Khaytan. ""Jordan's infrastructure can't cope with more refugees.""
Chronic water shortages have increased in recent years throughout Jordan's capital Amman, home to more than 40 percent of the country's population. Many neighbourhoods received running water for only 12 to 24 hours each week throughout May, partly due to low supply.
Jordanians living in northern towns along the Syrian borders said that the war in Syria has already cost them their jobs due to cheaper Syrian labour coming into Jordan.
But for Wissam Omar, an 18-year-old stall owner in downtown Amman, keeping the borders closed is an inhumane decision.
""These women and children we see on TV, they should be let in. They've seen enough suffering already.""

On Thursday, it was reported that Italy, Germany and Austria are expected to hold talks to seal the southern refugee route, while Germany's interior minister and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban separately called for returning more asylum seekers to Italy and Greece.
""We agreed ... that next week there will be a meeting of the German, Austrian and Italian interior ministers with the goal of taking measures to shut the Mediterranean route into Europe, to make sure that illegal immigration to Europe on this route is stopped,"" Austrian chancellor Sebastian Kurz told a press conference.
According to European Union rules, asylum seekers must apply for protection in the first country they enter. For the majority, the first ports of entry are in Greece and Italy.
In Greece, however, rights groups and observers say refugee camps are already overcrowded.
Eva Cosse, a Greece-based researcher with Human Rights Watch, explained that overcrowding was common in camps on both Greece's mainland and on several Aegean islands.
""Many asylum seekers are homeless on the streets of Athens and other big cities, and there are unaccompanied children with no access to accommodation,"" she told Al Jazeera.
Explaining that some 17,000 refugees and migrants have congregated on the Greek islands, she added: ""Most of the camps on the mainland are also full or over capacity.""
Boris Cheshirkov, spokesman for the United Nations' refugee agency UNHCR echoed those concerns.
""Conditions have deteriorated, and the sweltering July heat is adding to the misfortune of thousands of people, including pregnant women, newborn babies and families with young children,"" he told Al Jazeera.
""The capacity of services is stretched beyond capacity, including primary health and psychosocial assistance,"" Cheshirkov added.
Tensions between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and her Minister of the Interior Horst Seehofer have sown uncertainty over the future of the governing coalition.
In extracts from a Der Spiegel interview with Seehofer published on Friday, the interior minister said Germany would have to take unilateral action if an agreement was not reached with other EU countries.
His comments came two days after Merkel defended her government's refugee policy while urging ""more regulation regarding every type of migration"" and European cooperation.
Speaking to parliament, Merkel defended plans to create transit centres on the country's border with Austria to speed up the deportation of rejected asylum seekers.
That address came two days after Merkel and Seehofer reached a compromise on Monday, causing the latter to rescind threats to resign over migration policies.
These plans sparked concern in Austria, where a coalition government includes the right-wing Austrian People's Party and the far-right Freedom Party.
Earlier this week, the Austrian government announced its intention to ""take measures"" to ""protect"" its southern borders after Seehofer advocated stricter measures on the Germany-Austria frontier.
On July 1, Austria took over the EU rotating presidency for a six-month term.
Headed by Kurz, Austria aims to tighten border controls and stem the flow of refugees and migrants during its EU presidency.
Meanwhile, Italy's new far-right interior minister, Matteo Salvini, has called for quicker processing of asylum applications in order to speed up deportations.
Salvini also promised to put a stop to boats carrying refugees and migrants to Italy from North Africa.
Speaking to reporters on Thursday, Salvini, leader of the far-right League party (formerly the Northern League), said only ""pregnant women, children and refugees"" should be allowed to remain in Italy.
Salvini, who is also co-deputy prime minister, added: ""Protection is reserved for humanitarian cases.""
""If we don't block the flows from the south, it is a problem for everyone, so I hope next Thursday to awaken Europe's conscience on the need to intervene urgently,"" he added, referring to an upcoming meeting of interior members from Italy, Austria and Germany.
In a statement emailed to Al Jazeera, the Rome-based Association for Juridical Studies on Immigration said ""the dangers and risk of death [will] inevitably increase"" if people have less legal channels to reach Europe.
""European states should ensure regular [means of] entry in order to develop integration policies,"" the statement added.
According to UNHCR statistics, 16,739 refugees and migrants have reached Italy so far this year, while some 13,749 have arrived on Greek shores.
An estimated 1,408 people have died or gone missing at sea.
Despite the uptick in anti-refugee sentiment among European leaders and a flurry of moves to block migration routes, the number of arrivals pales in comparison to the height of the crisis.
In 2015, the year the refugee crisis erupted in Europe, more than a million people crossed the Mediterranean to reach the continent.

A wave of new refugees was massing at the other side of the frontier, seeking shelter from ferocious bombardment by pro-government forces in the southern Syrian province of Deraa.
They were in pressing need of everything: food, water, clothes, medicine.
""I came to this square [al-Hajuj Square] and called out to the people of al-Ramtha to act,"" Thiabat told Al Jazeera on Friday.
His appeal touched a nerve among Jordanians. The video was widely shared online, and contributions started pouring instantly - not only from al-Ramtha but all over Jordan.
""I drove this truck full of donations because we are one with the Syrians,"" said Mohamed Shiban, a 41-year-old retired officer who came to al-Ramtha all the way from Shoubak, in the south of Jordan.
""This [the truck] is only a sample of what is yet to come from the southern cities in support of Syrians across the border,"" he added.
Around 330,000 people have been forced from their homes in southern Syria since pro-government forces, backed by Russian air power, began their military offensive on June 19.
At least 60,000 of the displaced have gathered along the Jordanian border, according to the UN's refugee agency. Many of them have been left without shelter in the sweltering heat and are vulnerable to more shelling from Syrian and Russian air strikes.
Using the Arabic hashtag ""open the borders"", some Jordanians have been calling on their government to reverse a decision to keep its borders with Syria shut despite the escalating situation. Jordan is already home to around 1.4 million Syrian refugees.
At the large square in al-Ramtha - a space that has been used to collect donations for Syrians since the onset of the war in 2011 - a small army of volunteers is busy sorting clothes and arranging food containers and packed water bottles into piles.
Nearby, trucks filled with humanitarian aid line the square's perimeter, ready to depart and deliver the vital aid across the border.
Since the launch of the grassroots campaign, about 200 trucks of aid have crossed the border, organisers say.
Among the piles of donations flooding the square, the small figures of children can be seen helping out their volunteering parents.
""My sons have donated their toys and clothes,"" said Mohamed Khater, a 31-year-old volunteer, as he and his six-year-old son delivered black bin bags full of donations to the site.
Many Syrians living in Jordan have also contributed to the initiative.
""For three days now, dozens of Syrians have come to help sort the donations and pack them into the trucks,"" said Safaa Shihadat, a Syrian originally from Deraa who has been living in Jordan for six years.
""Our Jordanian siblings have been very responsive; the least we [Syrians] can do is help,"" she added.
Soon after the launch of the campaign, Jordan's government joined in and put the semi-governmental Jordan Hashemite Charity Organisation (JHCO) in charge of collecting the contributions and getting them to those in need in Syria.
After being collected by volunteers in al-Ramtha, the donations are transferred to JHCO storage areas. The organisation then loads them onto Syrian trucks at the Ramtha and Jaber border crossings.
According to Amira al-Ghanem, head of the local council of al-Ramtha and a volunteer with the campaign, the trucks are escorted by the Jordanian military, which coordinates their movement across the border.
""Dozens of trucks are prepared every day and delivered to the Syrians by way of the Jordanian military,"" said Ghanem.
Once in Syria, the aid is handed over to locals, who then distribute it to the displaced persons.
Jumana Ghunaimat, a spokesperson for the Jordanian government, said that while most of the aid going into Syria was collected by the public, the authorities were heavily involved in coordinating the campaign.
Despite the Jordanian government's participation in the relief efforts, the calls to open the border crossings have continued.
""I wish that the borders would open, especially for the women and children,"" said Khater, adding that ""they need food, water and protection.""
""They [Jordanian authorities] need to let them in,"" he added.

The flight of families on Thursday followed a series of intensive ""earth-shattering"" air strikes that targeted Deraa city and its surrounding areas, including the towns of Nassib, Om Elmiathin, Saida, al-Shayah and Tafas, activists and medics told Al Jazeera.
""The shelling doesn't spare anyone. They [regime forces] don't differentiate between civilians and military personnel, or between homes, mosques and hospitals,"" Amer Abazeid, a spokesperson for the Syria Civil Defence, also known as the White Helmets, told Al Jazeera from Deraa city.
""Regime forces today used all kinds of weapons against these villages, including barrel bombs and surface-to-surface missiles,"" he said.
At least six civilians have been killed in Thursday's attacks, which began following a brief lull after negotiations between rebel factions and Russia broke down.
On June 19, Assad's forces, along with Russian military assistance, began their offensive in Deraa and neighbouring Quneitra province.
The Civil Defence team in Deraa say they are still working on tallying the deaths, Abazeid noted. ""It has been increasingly challenging to do so without access to medical points,"" he explained.
Last month, Syria's air force targeted at least six hospitals and medical points across Deraa, making it challenging for medics to treat and tally wounded civilians, and those who lose their lives.
It is estimated that air raids launched by the government have killed more than 175 people so far.
The United Nations says the lives of more than 750,000 civilians are endangered by the ongoing fighting between government forces and the opposition. Rebels are now mostly situated in towns in the eastern front, close to border areas.
Kareem al-Aswad, an activist in Deraa city, said Thursday's bombardment caused families to leave and gather in areas less than 1 kilometre away from the Jordanian border.
""Air strikes targeted open spaces in towns that lay along the lines adjacent to border areas,"" al-Aswad told Al Jazeera from the outskirts of Deraa city.
""These spaces aren't empty … They're refugee camps,"" he said.
""They have in the past 10 days become havens to displaced people who fled from different parts of Deraa,"" al-Aswad added, describing the sounds of the bombs as ""earth-shattering"".
The 23-year-old said many of his family members were among those who chose to leave, but some have opted to stay hoping negotiations would end well this time around.
Following days of failed negotiations mediated by Jordan, which has repeatedly called for an immediate ceasefire, rebel factions and Russia are expected to resume talks on Friday.
Around 320,000 people have been displaced since the offensive began last month.
While 60,000 people are struck at the Nassib-Jaber border crossing overlooking Jordan, thousands more are now along the western border with the Israeli occupied Golan Heights.
But both Jordan and Israel say they will not be admitting refugees into their countries.
Mohammed Khalil and his family left Nassib for the border area 10 days ago.
The father of two, who has been displaced twice in the past several days, told Al Jazeera that thousands near the border were trying to cope under the scorching sun without access to basic supplies.
""Anyone here with a tent is considered lucky,"" he said from the area separating the border crossings of the two countries.
According to him, several deaths have occurred due to infections from snakebites, which are common in desert areas. Without access to adequate medical equipment and antibiotics, many of these fatalities could not have been saved.
Khalil said he also witnessed a handful of deaths as a result of polluted water consumption.
""None of the international aid agencies are present here,"" he said of the largely 'unequipped' area.
Though some aid provided by Jordanian citizens arrived on Wednesday, Khalil said it was barely enough for the tens of thousands of people - mostly women and children - currently at the border area.
Khalil, 23, hopes to return to Nassib in the near future.
""We don't want anything,"" he said. ""All we're asking for is a sense of lasting security and stability.""

About 270,000 have fled, the UN said, with tens of thousands currently stuck by the border with Jordan after the Russian-backed government offensive began to recapture rebel-held southwestern Deraa province.
According to the UN, nearly half of the displaced are children.
""This is the largest population displacement in southern Syria since the onset of the crisis,"" Anders Pedersen, UN resident and humanitarian coordinator in Jordan, wrote in a statement on Wednesday.
Jordan's Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi said on Wednesday that dozens of trucks were waiting for Syrian permission to supply humanitarian aid from Jordan to Syria.
Safadi was speaking at a news conference following talks with his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov in Moscow.
After artillery strikes hit Jordanian territory from Syria, he said Jordan's armed forces were ready to defend country's interests.
Amman has kept its borders shut for the new wave of refugees from Deraa, as the country says it is unable to host additional Syrians.
Jordan currently hosts more than 650,000 of the 5.2 million Syrian refugees spread across the region, according to the UN refugee agency (UNHCR).
However, the Jordanian government puts the number at 1.3 million, as the UNHCR only counts registered refugees, whereas Amman includes Syrians who have not received UN asylum.
The UN has dispatched humanitarian assistance over the past two months and has been helping to provide essential supplies such as food, water, soap and medical equipment with extra supplies prepared in case of further escalation in the conflict.
Children are at particular risk of dehydration and diarrhoea, Pederson noted.
""The United Nations reiterates its readiness to assist as much as needed but, at the same time, it also reminds all responsible parties that our effectiveness depends on facilitation of the provision of humanitarian aid and protection to people in need, in line with the parties' obligations under international humanitarian law,"" Pederson wrote.
""The United Nations reminds all states and parties involved in the conflict that a delay in responding to the worsening humanitarian crisis could only lead to catastrophic results.""
Since the war in Syria began in 2011, Jordan, Turkey and Lebanon have shouldered much of the responsibility in hosting Syrian refugees.
The UN's concern comes as Safadi and Lavrov met on Wednesday to discuss the situation in Deraa, located near the Jordanian border.
Safadi told Lavrov that political dialogue and a ceasefire were priorities for southern Syria where he said a humanitarian catastrophe risked unfolding.
Deraa is located in one of the four ""de-escalation zones"", as part of a Russian-led ceasefire deal for territory held by rebels. Russia, Turkey and Iran signed the deal in 2017 as guarantors.
Al Jazeera's Rory Challands reporting from Moscow said that while Safadi arrived in Moscow hoping to persuade Lavrov in implementing some sort of a ceasefire, ""he does not seem to have won that from the Russians.""
Lavrov and Safadi decided in the meeting to fulfil the de-escalation zone agreements, but Lavrov also added that the fight against ""terrorists"" in southern Syria remains a priority since they control about 40 percent, Challands said.
""That does not seem to me at the moment as if the Russians are willing to back off and there's a good reason for that. This is a tactic that has worked elsewhere in Syria,"" Challands said.
""We saw it in eastern Aleppo and in Douma - successful in both those places in winning territory back for the Syrian government. There was a huge military offensive in each of these places, massive Russian aerial bombardment that's helped to create a humanitarian crisis on the ground, which in turn put more pressure on rebel groups in the area.
""Russia then told the rebel groups that they had to lay down weapons and surrender or vacate these areas for other areas of Syria. That is something that we are seeing played out again in Deraa; it's worked for them before and there's no reason to suspect that it won't be able to work for them here as well.""

Judge James Boasberg issued a preliminary injunction on Monday ordering the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency to stop what opponents called the arbitrary detention of legitimate asylum seekers. The case in question continues, but the injunction opens up yet another legal front in the multi-directional battle being waged by the administration of President Donald Trump over immigration.
""This ruling means the Trump administration cannot use indefinite detention as a weapon to punish and deter asylum seekers,"" said Michael Tan, senior staff lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union's (ACLU) Immigrants' Rights Project.
The rights organisation added on Twitter that the ruling is a ""rejection of the blanket policy of locking up those seeking protection in this country"".
All individuals seeking asylum must initially pass a ""credible fear"" screening to determine if they face a threat of persecution in their home countries. Those who fail that standard are deported immediately.
Previously, those who passed were usually given humanitarian parole while awaiting an immigration hearing, provided they were not considered flight risks or dangers to the public.
Under former President Barack Obama's administration, ICE granted humanitarian parole to more than 90 percent of asylum seekers.
Lawyers for the ACLU and other groups argued in May that since the start of Trump's administration, the number of people granted such parole has dropped to almost zero in five key ICE field offices: Detroit, Michigan; El Paso, Texas; Los Angeles, California; Newark, New Jersey; and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
According to the ACLU, more than 1,000 asylum seekers have been denied parole in these five districts alone.
Those denied parole have instead been detained; in one case, a former ethics teacher from Haiti has spent more than 18 months in prison.
Our client, Ansly, an ethics teacher from Haiti, fled violent, political persecution. He has been granted asylum by a judge TWICE, but the government has appealed each time.@ICEgov has not let him outside for more than a year. https://t.co/9wV54P0154
Judge Boasberg, in a 38-page memorandum opinion, concluded that ""the numbers here are irrefutable,"" and ordered a case-by-case review of all asylum seekers awaiting parole. Meanwhile, the lawsuit will continue with a status hearing July 10.
""The denial letters that they were issuing were just boiler-plate - deny, deny, deny,"" said Hardy Vieux, legal director for Human Rights First. ""This is the court saying, 'I've seen enough to tell [the government] to stop what you're doing and we'll talk later.'""
The injunction comes as anger continues to mount on Trump over his ""zero-tolerance"" policy towards refugees and migrants.
Last week, the administration was forced to temporarily scale back its practice of referring all individuals who cross the border between ports of entry.
This came after Trump issued an executive order stopping his administration's tactic of separating children from their parents at the border. Citing the executive order, Customs and Border Protection said it was temporarily halting the practice of handing most parents who arrive with their children over for prosecution.
Meanwhile, the Department of Justice asked a California judge to modify a federal court ruling that said migrant and refugee children can only be kept in detention for up to 20 days.
The Trump administration insists its zero-tolerance policy is still in place.

Opposition spokesman Lam Paul Gabriel called the proposal ""definitely illegal"" and ""anti-peace"" as the warring sides pursue a peace agreement.
Gabriel told journalists in the capital, Juba, on Tuesday that the plot to keep Kiir in office until 2021 undermines peace talks with opposition forces.
The South Sudanese presidency on Monday proposed a bill to parliament to amend the constitution and extend the tenure of President Salva Kiir, his deputies and governors, Paul Yoane Bonju, a member of parliament said.
Parliament intends to vote it into law this month, Bonju said.
Another legislator, Atem Garang, said the planned extension of Kiir's term is almost guaranteed as the ruling party holds a majority of seats in parliament.
""If they don't extend it there will be anarchy and war. You'll have a country without a government,"" Garang told The Associated Press.
South Sudan's President Salva Kiir and his opponent Riek Machar agreed, at talks in the Sudanese capital Khartoum last Wednesday, to a ""permanent"" ceasefire to take effect within 72 hours, raising hopes of an end to a devastating civil war.
The latest ceasefire was violated hours after it began with the government and armed opposition trading blame.
The previous ceasefire in December was violated within hours as well, prompting a new push by the international community to threaten UN and regional sanctions against those blocking the path to peace.
South Sudan's civil war has killed tens of thousands and created Africa's largest refugee crisis since the 1994 Rwandan genocide.
Both sides have been accused of abuses, including gang-rapes, some along ethnic lines.
Millions are near famine and aid delivery is often blocked in one of the world's most dangerous countries for humanitarian workers.
The conflict erupted in 2013, around two years after South Sudan won independence from Sudan, when Kiir accused his then-deputy Machar of plotting a coup.

Guterres described the situation for the persecuted ethnic minority as ""a humanitarian and human rights nightmare"", as he prepared to tour makeshift shelters crammed with people who escaped a Myanmar army operation last year that the UN has called a ""textbook case of ethnic cleansing"".
""In Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh, I've just heard unimaginable accounts of killing and rape from Rohingya refugees who recently fled Myanmar. They want justice and a safe return home,"" Guterres wrote on Twitter.
He said that as many as 200,000 Rohingya in the camps need to be relocated, as the monsoon season threatens their safety.

""The Rohingya are one of the most discriminated against and vulnerable communities on Earth,"" he said in a tweet before his visit to the camps in southern Bangladesh.
Al Jazeera's Mohammed Jamjoom, reporting from Cox's Bazar, said that the visit highlights the ""dire"" situation of the Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh.
""This is a population that is already very vulnerable,"" he said, noting that a ""torrential downpour"" was battering the area on Monday.
Accompanied by the head of the World Bank, Jim Yong-kim, Guterres called it a ""mission of solidarity with Rohingya refugees and the communities supporting them. The compassion & generosity of the Bangladeshi people shows the best of humanity and saved many thousands of lives"".
Nearly 700,000 Rohingya fled Myanmar to Bangladesh since August 2017.

The Rohingya face discrimination in Myanmar, where they have been stripped of their citizenship.
A UN Security Council delegation visited Myanmar and Rakhine state in early May, meeting refugees who gave detailed accounts of killings, rape and villages torched at the hands of Myanmar's military.
Myanmar has vehemently denied allegations by the US, the UN and others of ethnic cleansing.
Bangladesh and Myanmar agreed in November to begin repatriating the Rohingya but the process has stalled, with both sides accusing the other of frustrating the effort.
Fewer than 200 have been resettled, and the vast majority refuse to contemplate returning until their rights, citizenship and safety are guaranteed.
Around 100 Rohingya staged a protest just before Guterres's visit, unhappy about a preliminary UN deal with Myanmar to assess conditions on the ground for their possible return home.
The United Nations has said that conditions in the persecuted minority's home state of Rakhine in western Myanmar are not conducive to the refugees' safe, voluntary and dignified repatriation.

Jordanian Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi said on Monday he will meet his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov in Moscow later in the week to discuss developments in Deraa province, near Jordan's border.
On Sunday, rebels in the strategically located town of Bosra al-Sham in Syria's southern Deraa province surrendered to forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad.
Talks leading up to the agreement - which stipulates the opposition handing over heavy weaponry to the government - were mediated by neighbouring Jordan.
Renewed fighting along Jordan's northern border has prompted a new wave of refugees headed towards its territory.
Launched on June 19, the Syrian government's push is intended to recapture the southern provinces of Deraa, Quneitra and parts of Sweida, still mostly held by opposition fighters.
Backed by Russian air support, forces loyal to al-Assad have retaken control of lost territory and continue to progress southwards where the last pockets of opposition remain.
Syrians fleeing the fighting and heading towards Jordan have been denied entry, with authorities there saying they do not have the resources to deal with more refugees.
""Jordan already has 1.3 million Syrians. Our country has reached its maximum capacity. Jordan has been shouldering this responsibility, and I must say, we've been doing so alone,"" Safadi said on Thursday.
Karl Schembri, from the Norwegian Refugee Council, said aid agencies were ready to help if Jordan lets the refugees cross its border.
""We know that they are lacking the most basics; water, food, even shelter,"" Schembri told Al Jazeera from the capital Amman.
""They are stranded there and they are facing some of the most dire conditions - it's summer now, it's getting hotter and they've been fleeing from extreme escalation of fighting in their areas. They are tired, exhausted and we still can't reach them.""
The government's offensive has undermined a ""de-escalation"" agreement negotiated by the United States, Russia and Jordan in July 2017.
Until recently, the deal contained fighting in the southwest of Syria.
Al-Assad said earlier this month that he was still pursuing a political solution for Syria's rebel-held southwest, but would use military force if the effort failed.
Responding to Assad's statements, the US state department said on June 14 that any government assault would ""broaden the conflict"" and threatened ""firm and appropriate measures in response"".
Washington has yet to respond to recent developments. Last week, rebels said it had told them not to expect any US military support.
The opposition's chief negotiator in wider UN peace talks, Nasr al-Hariri, last week accused the US of complicity in al-Assad's southwest offensive, saying US silence could only be explained by ""a malicious deal"".
Bolstered by a string of victories across southern Syria, al-Assad's chief backer Russia has been reluctant to yield to the opposition's demands.
""The Russian insistence on attempting to impose conditions, their unreadiness to stop the air strikes during negotiations, all this gives us more reason for a lack trust and justified fear,"" Adnan Masalmeh, a coordinator of an opposition committee steering the negotiators told Reuters news agency.
Diplomatic sources say that wider negotiations were difficult, with Russia insisting on sweeping surrender terms and rebels seeking an agreement that would make Jordan a guarantor of the safety of Deraa province's 800,000 civilians.
The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said on Friday that the surge in fighting over the past two days had led to the displacement of an estimated 160,000 people.

https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/07/germany-hardline-csu-leader-unhappy-merkel-migration-plan-180701174707967.html,refugee,727,Sun Jul 01 2018 19:31:02 GMT+0000,None,Germany: Hardline CSU leader 'unhappy' with Merkel migration plan,"The leader of German Chancellor Angela Merkel's Bavarian allies has reportedly rejected a deal she secured in Brussels last week to slash migration, escalating a crisis that threatens to bring down her conservative alliance.
Merkel has been under pressure for weeks from Bavaria's Christian Social Union (CSU), the sister party of her centre-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU).
The CSU, which faces a stiff challenge from the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party in October's regional polls, has been demanding a significant hardening of Germany immigration policy.
Amid the increasing tensions, Merkel and the rest of the European Union leaders hammered out on Friday a vaguely-worded deal to share out refugees on a voluntary basis and create ""controlled centres"" inside the bloc to process asylum requests.
CSU leaders gathered in Munich from 3pm (13:00 GMT) to decide their response to the EU deal.
Party sources told AFP news agency that Horst Seehofer, interior minister and leader of the CSU, told aides he was unhappy with the accord and complained to that he had endured a ""conversation with no effect"" with the chancellor on Saturday.
Reuters news agency also quoted a party source as saying that Seehofer saw no alternative to turning some migrants back at the country's border.
Meanwhile, Merkel and her top aides from the CDU also met on Sunday in the capital, Berlin.
Earlier in the day, Merkel told broadcaster ZDF she would do ""everything possible to achieve results that mean we can continue to assume responsibility for our country"", adding that ""everyone knows the situation is serious"" between her CDU and their CSU allies.
She reiterated her determination to act in a way that was ""not unilateral and that are not to the detriment of third parties"" - highlighting her continued opposition to proposals by Seehofer to turn back refugees at the border.
""The sum of all we've agreed is equivalent to what the CSU wants - that's my personal view, but the CSU must decide for themselves,"" she said.
""It is also sustainable and in accordance with the European ideal. Europe is slow, and we aren't yet where we want to be... In my view, Europe will be held together, otherwise free movement could have been in danger,"" she added.
Seehofer rejected her assessment that the EU-wide measures would ""have the same effect"" as his demand to turn away at the border asylum-seekers already registered in other EU nations.
If he orders border police to go ahead with the scheme in defiance of the chancellor, Merkel would be forced to fire him, in turn prompting a CSU walkout that would cost her her majority in parliament.
Under the deal, EU leaders agreed to consider setting up ""disembarkation platforms"" outside the bloc, most likely in North Africa, in a bid to discourage migrants and refugees boarding EU-bound boats.
Member countries could also create processing centres to determine whether the new arrivals are returned home as economic migrants or admitted as refugees in willing states.
At the national level, Merkel also proposes that migrants arriving in Germany who first registered in another EU country should be placed in special ""admission centres"" under restrictive conditions, according to a document she sent to the CSU and coalition partners the Social Democratic Party (SPD).
A document circulated by Merkel to coalition allies on Friday night outlined repatriation agreements with 16 countries and proposed reception centres in Germany where migrants would undergo an accelerated asylum procedure - measures that represent a significant hardening of her 2015 open-door asylum policy.
But the Czech Republic, Poland and Hungary, whose Prime Minister Viktor Orban has long sought to position himself as Merkel's nemesis in the immigration debate polarising the continent, later said they had signed no bilateral agreements on repatriation.
Political stability was upset by Merkel's 2015 decision to keep borders open to migrants and refugees arriving from the Middle East via the Balkans, Hungary and Austria. Since then, more than one million people have arrived in Germany, while Merkel's governments have repeatedly tightened immigration and asylum laws. Nevertheless, the anti-refugee, anti-Islam AfD was propelled into federal parliament for the first time last year by outrage over immigration, leading to months of paralysis while Merkel struggled to find a workable coalition. Opinion polls point to the AfD making a similarly spectacular entrance to Bavaria's parliament in October.

Sunday's talks come after at least 75 people, including 23 children and 14 women, were killed in air raids by Syria's air force in the past 24 hours, local sources told Al Jazeera.
A team representing the Free Syrian Army's (FSA) rebels was holding talks with Russian officers in the town of Bosra al-Sham on Sunday morning, Ibrahim al-Jabawi, the spokesperson for the central operations room representing FSA negotiators told Reuters news agency.
Talks failed on Saturday, after a meeting in which Russian officers met the rebel team and demanded a complete surrender, rebels said.
A government's offensive this month in southwest Syria has taken much of the eastern part of Deraa province from rebels, backed by a bombardment that the United Nations says has pushed 160,000 people out of their homes.
The failed meeting on Saturday was aimed to try to agree on a deal to restore government sovereignty to all of Deraa province, but without the army or police entering the area.
""The meeting ended in failure. The Russians were not ready to listen to our demands. They offered one option, to accept their humiliating demand to surrender, which was rejected,"" al-Jabawi was quoted as saying by the Reuters news agency.
Russian negotiators demanded rebels accept terms like those agreed for Eastern Ghouta, where fighters either left for opposition territory in the northwest along with their families or accepted the return of state rule, al-Jabawi had said earlier.
The southwest rebels did not accept the proposal and were instead proposing the return of civilian state institutions in the opposition areas and the entry of Russian military police rather than Syrian government forces.
However, the army has already captured large parts of the eastern zone of rebel-held territory in Deraa province in less than two weeks of fighting, and several more towns still held by the opposition fighters have reportedly agreed to settle with Assad.
On Saturday, state television said the town of al-Ghariya al-Sharqiya had accepted a ""reconciliation"" agreement with the government, and the national flag had been raised in the town.
It said on Friday that four other towns nearby had agreed to surrender their arms and accept state rule. The army had gained control over the towns of al-Harak, Ibta and Rakham, it said, and a rebel said opposition lines in one area had collapsed.
Syrians fleeing the fighting and heading towards neighbouring Jordan have been denied entry, with authorities there saying they do not have the resources to deal with a new wave of refugees.
""Jordan already has 1.3 million Syrians. Our country has reached its maximum capacity. Jordan has been shouldering this responsibility, and I must say, we've been doing so alone,"" Jordan's Minister of Foreign Affairs Ayman Safadi said on Thursday.
Karl Schembri, from the Norwegian Refugee Council, says aid agencies are ready to help, if Jordan lets the refugees cross its border.

""They are stranded there and they are facing some of the most dire conditions - it's summer now, it's getting hotter, and they've been fleeing from extreme escalation of fighting in their areas. They are tired, exhausted and we still can't reach them.""
Schembri issued an appeal to the international community not to abandon Jordan and the Syrians escaping the fierce fighting.
""Jordan needs all the help possible in this moment of crisis. It is also going through a very tough economic moment, with a lot of unemployment and people who are on the poverty line so, of course, Jordan needs all this solidarity together with the Syrians who are now fleeing this fighting that has decimated their neighbourhoods.""

""Despite the hurdles, we continue to protect the right to life of invisible people. Their stories on what they experienced [in] Libya are terrifying,"" Proactiva Open Arms said on Twitter on Saturday,
However, it remained unclear where the NGO's Open Arms vessel would be allowed to anchor.
The news comes a day after three babies were found dead and 100 more went missing in a shipwreck off Libya that Proactiva Open Arms, whose charity rescue boat was in the area, said could potentially have been avoided.
It also follows a vaguely worded deal by European Union member aimed at controlling the number of migrants and refugees arriving on the continent.
Under the controversial deal, ""controlled centres"" will be set up in member states on a voluntary basis for ""rapid and secure"" process to distinguish between those eligible for asylum. The bloc's leaders also agreed to increase funding for Turkey and freed up 500 million euros ($581m) in funding for North African states.
Reacting to the rescue by Proactiva Open Arms, Italy's anti-immigration Interior Minister Matteo Salvini said on Facebook: ""The nearest port is Malta, the organisation and flag are Spanish: they can forget about coming to an Italian port.""
Malta's interior minister retorted on Twitter that the refugees had been rescued between Libya and the Italian island of Lampedusa.
""Stop spreading incorrect information by pointing the finger at Malta without any reason,"" Michael Farrugia said.
Italy's new populist government and Malta earlier this month refused to let dock the French NGO rescue ship Aquarius carrying more than 600 refugees and migrants. The move triggered an international outcry before Spain stepped in to help.
Malta then allowed another charity rescue ship, MV Lifeline, dock with 233 refugees and migrants on board.
That vessel, operated by German charity Mission Lifeline, picked the refugees up just outside Libya's 12-mile territorial waters on June 21. The ship is now the subject of an investigation in Malta.
Proactiva Open Arms also accused coastguards in the area of hindering their work.
The NGO said Friday's shipwreck could potentially have been avoided as the official call for help from Italy's rescue control centre only came one hour after Open Arms overheard an EU plane warning Libyan coastguards that a migrant boat was in trouble.

In Washington, DC, immigrant parents and children, activists, religious leaders and celebrities addressed the crowd attending Saturday's ""Families Belong Together"" protest and called for an end to Trump's ""inhumane"" immigration policies and the reunification of children and parents who were separated at the border.
Among the people taking the stage was Jocelyn, an asylum seeker from Brazil, who shared her ordeal when her son was taken away from her upon arrival to the US last summer.
The two were separated for nine months and nine days, she said. During that time, federal officials told the mother her son may be put up for adoption, added Jocelyn, as cries of ""shame"" erupted among the crowds.
She was finally reunited with her son on June 5 after winning a lawsuit filed by American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU).
Some in attendance said they travelled ""all night"" to be at the protest.
""I have never been more depressed,"" Courtney Carter from Maryland said.
""I have never felt so hopeless and helpless, but I continue to show up,"" Carter told Al Jazeera.
""During the Parkland shooting, during the women's march, and here today. I will be here, rain or shine, heat or not. Nothing kept me from today.""
Saturday's protests come as more than 2,000 children remain separated from their families, according to a Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) fact sheet released on June 20.
Family separations were part of the administration's zero-tolerance policy, announced in early April.
Bowing to pressure last week, Trump signed an executive order that ended the controversial tactic, but protests have continued as questions remain over when and how families will be reunited.
""I never thought I'd have to do this again,"" Donna McDonough told Al Jazeera in Washington, DC. The last time she was at a protest was in the late 1960s, she said, when Richard Nixon was president.
A former pediatric nurse, she said the harm caused to children separated from their families would be lifelong in some cases.
""These will cause lifelong trauma. This will be with the families forever,"" she said. ""And some of the separations may be permanent. [Federal officials] do not know where families’ children are.
""We are in a time like Weimar Germany, before [Adolf] Hitler took power. People think it cannot happen here, they’re in for a surprise.""

Government-released videos showing children housed in metal cages and using large foil sheets as blanket, as well as leaked videos showing children in tears and wailing for their parents, have caused widespread outrage over Trump's zero-tolerance policy.
A federal judge on Tuesday gave federal officials less than a month to reunite families with their children. Children under the age of five need to be reunited with families within two weeks.
Trump's executive order is seen by many as a way for the president to only shift his policy so that families can remain in detention for long periods of time.
Last week, the Department of Justice asked a court in California to modify a federal court ruling that said migrant and refugee children can only be kept in detention for up to 20 days.
After recent visits to detention centres, Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal said families were ""gratified that hundreds of thousands of people were going out on the streets"" in their name.
""They are heartbroken, they are angry, they will do anything to get their children back,"" she told Al Jazeera, prior to Saturday's protest. ""They are told they can get their children back if they drop their asylum claims. That is a huge problem. It's illegal, and they might not get their children back even then.""
Katharina Obser, senior policy adviser with Migrant Rights and Justice, said the inhumane policies and separations were ""not only traumatising to family members, but also severely inhibits access to asylum in the US"".
""All that is on people's mind is what happened to their children,"" she said. ""Concerns have been fear of not knowing when they will see their children.""
Over the past few weeks a number of demonstrations have broken out across the country.
Protesters in several US cities have set up camp outside Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) buildings, calling for the abolishment of the agency.
On Thursday, more than 500 women were arrested during an all-women sit-in at the atrium of a Senate office building. Protesters called for an end to detention camps and the end of ICE.
Congresswoman Jayapal, who has long called for the abolishment of ICE, was among those arrested.
""It's a rogue agency,"" she said. ""They have no accountability. They are acting as a mass deportation force and terrorising families across the country.""
Pramila Jayapal, US Representative, Washington's 7th district
Jayapal had doubts federal officials know how to bring families back together.
""I don't think they kept good track which children belong to which parents,"" she said. ""Particularly children that are preverbal that cannot say parents' names or who they belong to.""
At a federal prison she said a woman showed her a state-issued slip supposedly with the name of her two children, along with her own name and ID.
""She came to me with the slip and said these are not my children,"" Pramila said. ""This is a huge tragedy.""

""Jordan already has 1.3 million Syrians. Our country has reached its maximum capacity. Jordan has been shouldering this responsibility, and I must say, we've been doing so alone,"" Jordan's Minister of Foreign Affairs Ayman Safadi said on Thursday.
Karl Schembri, from the Norwegian Refugee Council, says aid agencies are ready to help, if Jordan lets the refugees cross its border.
""We know that they are lacking the most basics: water, food, even shelter,"" he told Al Jazeera from Jordan's capital, Amman.
""They are stranded there and they are facing some of the most dire conditions - it's summer now, it's getting hotter, and they've been fleeing from extreme escalation of fighting in their areas. They are tired, exhausted and we still can't reach them.""
Schembri issued an appeal to the international community not to abandon Jordan and the Syrians escaping the fierce fighting.
""Jordan needs all the help possible in this moment of crisis. It is also going through a very tough economic moment, with a lot of unemployment and people who are on the poverty line so, of course, Jordan needs all this solidarity together with the Syrians who are now fleeing this fighting that has decimated their neighbourhoods.""

The agreement, sealed early on Friday in a tense Brussels summit after a night of haggling, appeared to be aimed at preventing entry for even the most vulnerable people, Doctors Without Borders (known by its French initials, MSF), said in a statement.
""The only thing European states appear to have agreed on is to block people at the doorstep of Europe regardless of how vulnerable they are, or what horrors they are escaping,"" said Karline Kleijer, MSF's emergencies chief.
She also accused the deal of aiming to ""demonise non-governmental search and rescue operations"".
The 28 leaders agreed to consider setting up ""disembarkation platforms"" outside the bloc, most likely in North Africa, in a bid to discourage migrants boarding EU-bound boats.
No third country has so far offered to host these reception centres, where authorities would distinguish between irregular migrants and asylum seekers admissible into the EU.
According to the EU deal, member countries could also set up processing centres - but only on a voluntary basis - to determine whether the arrivals returned home as economic migrants or were admitted as refugees in willing states.
Kleijer was especially critical of the likelihood that migrants would be sent to chaotic situations in Libya, where refugees have faced abuse, exploitation and trafficking.
""Without batting an eyelid, they have formalised - through financing and training - the use of the Libyan coastguard to intercept people and return them to Libya,"" she said.
""European governments do this fully in the knowledge that these people will be sent to arbitrary detention and subject to extreme abuse.""
Kleijer warned that the EU's ""actions block and obstruct us from doing the work EU governments are failing to do, all the while dehumanising people in need"".
""Any deaths caused by this are now at their hands,"" she said.
Libya is one of the countries in which the EU is considering setting up its ""disembarkation platforms,"" along with Algeria, Egypt, Morocco, Niger and Tunisia. However, details are still vague.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) cautiously welcomed the EU's new plan but cautioned that it must be made clearer and said African involvement via the African Union regional bloc in the plan was ""indispensable"".
UNHCR spokesman Charlie Yaxley noted that for the fifth year in a row the ""grim milestone"" of 1,000 migrant deaths in the Mediterranean has been crossed already - and it's still only in the first half of 2018.
The Libyan coastguard said on Friday that about 100 people were missing and feared dead after their boat capsized off the coast of the country. Fourteen others were rescued after being picked up from the sea.
EU leaders, however, praised the plan as an achievement.
In a final statement full of convoluted language designed to appease the divergent views, the leaders agreed to restrict migrant movement within the bloc but made clear virtually all of their pledges would be carried out on a ""voluntary basis"" by member states.
They also agreed to tighten their external border and increase financing for Turkey, Morocco and other North African states to prevent migration to Europe.
Italian Interior Minister Matteo Salvini, whose far-right League party campaigned to bar migrants fleeing Africa and expel those already in Italy, said he was ""satisfied and proud of our government's results in Brussels"".
""Finally, Europe has been forced to discuss an Italian proposal... [and] finally Italy is no longer isolated and has returned to being a protagonist,"" he said in a statement.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel conceded differences remained on an issue that threatens her political career, telling reporters the EU still had ""a lot of work to do to bridge the different views"".
Merkel was given an ultimatum by her interior minister to reach a European deal on migration at the summit or face unilateral action that explicitly went against her wishes, in a political crisis that threatened to bring an early end to her fourth coalition government.
For his part, French President Emmanuel Macron told reporters that ""a complete approach was adopted"".
""We are protecting better. We are cooperating more. And we are reaffirming our principles. All hastily-made solutions, be they solely national ones or a betrayal of our values that consists in pushing people off to third countries, were clearly set aside,"" he said.
Al Jazeera's Laurence Lee, reporting from the summit in Brussels, said that ""if this was a success, it was only in that it staved off the apparent imminent collapse talk of the EU under the weight of migration.
""But in doing so, it gave more way to the populist right wing in Europe, a further retreat from the liberal values the EU is so fond of proclaiming,"" he added.
""As ever, the final communique was very long on wishes and very short of promises about how to accomplish them. This may have averted a crisis now, but Europe remains a political unit deeply unhappy.""
The tensions at the summit underscored the bloc's deeper divisions in dealing with migration, even as arrivals are significantly lower compared with 2015.

Migrant experts and humanitarian aid groups expressed fear that the EU agreement is a political smokescreen aimed at addressing the concerns of resurgent anti-migrant parties in Europe and which will only leave vulnerable people once again at risk.
""At a time when EU leadership on global issues is needed more than ever, European heads of state and government continue to try to offload their responsibilities onto poorer countries outside the EU,"" said Oxfam migration policy adviser Raphael Shilhav.
Shilhav said it looks like the EU is planning more ""de facto detention centres"" and warned that, ""This approach to migration is a recipe for failure, and directly threatens the rights of women, men and children on the move.""
Imogen Sudbery at the International Rescue Committee said the new ""disembarkation platforms"" raise more questions than answers.
""Would this approach be compatible with international law? Would those apprehended be transferred to the nearest safe port? Crucially, under which country's law would claims be assessed? Who would be responsible for those whose claims are upheld? We need clarity on this,"" Sudbery said.
On the seas, there was also scepticism. The captain of a ship operated by the Spanish Proactiva humanitarian group worries that the EU-funded and trained Libyan coastguard might now be recognised as part of the Mediterranean rescue apparatus. He said having the Libyan coastguard involved simply further endangered vulnerable migrants.
""For months now, they have been presented as an official body, formal, very well trained and legal. And these are the same people who have shot at us, who have kidnapped us,"" said Astral Captain Riccardo Gatti. ""All of this is theatre.""
Inside Story
Is the EU closer to solving the migration crisis?

The MV Lifeline soared to notoriety this week after it refused to hand over 233 refugees and migrants it rescued to Libyan authorities.
The vessel, operated by German charity Mission Lifeline, picked the refugees up just outside Libya's 12-mile territorial waters on June 21. What followed pitted governments against freelance search-and-rescuers.
""After a while, a Libyan coastguard boat approached us and told us to hand [over] the migrants to them,"" Lifeline cofounder Axel Steier told Al Jazeera.
""They wanted to bring back the migrants to Libya where they would be put [in] jail. So we said … there is no way for us to hand [over] the migrants,"" he said.
The Lifeline was operating under the coordination of the Italian coastguard, which effectively seconded the Libyan coastguard's request.
""The Italians … provided us with case numbers, but actually, they handed over these cases to the Libyans and said to us, 'the Libyans take responsibility for this rescue',"" Steier said.
""We think that Italians are breaking international law, because Libya is not safe and the people are crowded in such prisons, they face malnutrition there; torture and rape, for sure, so we are sure this is not a solution and should stop very soon.""
The Lifeline spent six days at sea, unable to find a European port that would accept its refugees, reflecting how attitudes in Europe have hardened since the anti-immigration government of Giuseppe Conte took power in Italy.
Maltese Prime Minister Joseph Muscat said the Lifeline ""went against international rules and ignored directions given by Italian authorities"".
It was, however, allowed to dock in Malta on Wednesday. The ship is now the subject of an investigation.
France had earlier agreed to take in some of the refugees and migrants on board the ship, but French President Emmanuel Macron accused the rescue boat of ""playing into the hands of smugglers by reducing the risks of the journey"".
Veronique Fayet, head of the French NGO Secours Catholique, said the leaders' words ""are very violent for charities like ours, who are very active with migrants, and who do not see any similarity between ourselves and people smuggling"".
The idea of offshoring migrant camps, and the humanitarian responsibility that goes with rescue, now seems to be at the heart of Europe's thinking.
Last year, Italy agreed to provide Libya with coastguard vessels, in return for the Libyan authorities holding back refugees who try to cross to Europe. Amnesty International estimates that Libya prevented 20,000 from crossing last year, reducing flows by 78 percent.
It's not just that Italy has been eager to uphold its arrangement as a blueprint. Countries like Austria, Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic, Denmark and Slovakia are inclined to support it.
Those same states have refused to participate in a redistribution of asylum applicants crowding the EU's external border states, Greece, Italy, France, Malta and Spain.
That redistribution was a central plank of the Common European Asylum Policy, which now appears to be unravelling.
The idea is catching on with the European Commission (EC). An EC draft document leaked days before the summit said: ""We will support and organise more protection and reception capacity outside the EU as well as resettlement (on a voluntary basis) while fully respecting legal guarantees in the field of asylum.""
The document also said political leverage would be used to persuade countries that produce migrants to keep them at home.
""We will broaden the negotiation framework with countries of origin, using legal migration pathways (vocational training, studies, work) and visa policy as leverage. We will apply adequate conditionality in our bilateral relations with them.""
Early on Friday, EU leaders reached a vaguely worded deal aimed at controlling the number of migrants and refugees going to Europe. Under the deal, ""controlled centres"" will be set up in member states on a voluntary basis for ""rapid and secure"" process to distinguish between those eligible for asylum. The leaders also agreed to increase funding for Turkey and freed up 500 million euros ($581m) in funding for North Africa.
Lifeline's Steier, who spoke to Al Jazeera before the deal was struck, described the terror felt by the ship's passengers at the prospect of returning to Libya.
Many had crossed the desert from Sudan at great expense, discomfort and danger.
""When the Libyan coastguard arrived, people feared a lot and one man was coming to the captain and got down on his knees and praying, 'Don't hand us over, don't hand us over,' and afterwards he took our captain in his arms and said, 'Thank you, thank you, thank you,' and was crying.""
Steier also thinks some members of Libya's coastguard are involved in smuggling operations.
""In Libya, you have to pay for a ride on these [refugee] boats, it costs about $600. If you get caught by the coastguard, maybe they bring you back to an official disembarkation point, or you get sold to the smugglers, and after you are owned by your smuggler, you face torture.
""They send torture videos to the family to get another time $600 and then, they send out again. This is the money game with the people in Libya, which also involves the Libyan coastguard.""
Earlier this month, the UN imposed sanctions on six individuals, including Abd Al Rahman al-Milad, the head of a regional coastguard unit in Libya, for allegedly leading smuggling and trafficking networks in the country.
Milad has denied the accusations, according to the Reuters news agency.
A case has been filed against Italy at the European Court of Human Rights for sending migrants and refugees back to camps where torture and ill-treatment may occur, violating a principle known as ""refoulment"" under the Geneva Convention. Should the court uphold the plaintiff, Italy's policy would have to change.
The Italian coastguard did not respond to Al Jazeera's requests for comment.
Steier says Lifeline is in possession of such a video from one of the people it rescued, and will release it in the coming fortnight.

A hard-fought, but vaguely worded deal was struck early on Friday after more than nine hours of negotiations at an EU summit in Brussels.
Leaders agreed that ""controlled centres"" should be set up in member states on a voluntary basis for ""rapid and secure"" processing to distinguish between irregular migrants and refugees eligible for asylum.
It was not yet clear which countries would host the centres.
Relocation and resettlement from the centres would also happen on a voluntary basis, the joint statement said, suggesting countries will not be required to take in people.
EU28 leaders have agreed on #euco conclusions incl. migration.
The leaders agreed to increase funding for Turkey and freed up 500 million euros ($581m) in funding for North Africa.
A joint statement asked to ""swiftly explore"" the concept of ""regional disembarkation platforms"" where migrants and refugees would be processed in third countries ""to eliminate the incentive to embark on perilous journeys"" .
The agreement calls on all member states to ""take all necessary internal legislative and administrative measures"" to counter movement of asylum seekers within the EU while the 28 countries agreed to share responsibility for migrants rescued at sea.
After the announcement of the deal, Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said: ""Today Italy is no longer alone"".
Italy had threatened to veto any deal if fellow EU leaders failed to do more to help the country, where a large share of incoming migrants and refugees arrive.
When asked about his view on the agreement, Italy's interior minister Matteo Salvini, who campaigned on an anti-immigrant platform, said ""let's see the concrete commitments"".
German Chancellor Angela Merkel told reporters the EU still had ""a lot of work to do to bridge the different views"".
Merkel was given an ultimatum by her interior minister to reach a European deal on migration at the summit or face unilateral action that explicitly went against her wishes, in a political crisis that threatened to bring an early end to her fourth coalition government.
EU migration commissioner Dimitris Avramopoulos hailed the agreement as a ""first positive step towards more solidarity"".
A first positive step towards more solidarity on disembarkation, controlled centres for processing in the EU, including relocation and resettlement. I call on all to make this solidarity a reality. #EUCO #migrationEU
Reporting from Brussels, Al Jazeera's Laurence Lee called the deal a ""win for the hardliners"".
""What it does is appease Italy,"" he said, adding that it also takes the ""pressure off Angela Merkel"".
In recent weeks, vessels with rescued migrants and refugees on board have been left stranded in the Mediterranean after they were barred from docking.
On Wednesday, humanitarian ship Lifeline docked in Malta after eight countries had agreed to take a share of the refugees and migrants on board.
Earlier in June, hundreds of migrants and refugees arrived in Spain after the vessels that rescued them were turned away by both Italy and Malta.
The political crisis over migrants comes amid a steep decline in the amount of people arriving on Europe's shores.
The United Nations' refugee agency has said it expects about 80,000 people to arrive by sea this year, which is about half the number that arrived in 2017.
In 2015, more than a million refugees and migrants arrived in Europe.
""It really is this engineered panic,"" Judith Sunderland, an associate director at Human Rights Watch's Europe and Central Asia division, told Al Jazeera.
On Friday, EU leaders will reconvene to discuss Brexit and the eurozone.

Merkel made the announcement as she and 27 other EU leaders prepare to meet to discuss migration and a controversial proposal to set up processing centres for asylum seekers in northern Africa among other issues during a two-day summit in Brussels.
""Either we manage it, so others in Africa believe that we are guided by values and believe in multilateralism, not unilateralism, or nobody will believe any longer in the system of values that has made us strong,"" she said.
""That's why it's so important.""
EU leaders are deeply divided over how to handle the flow of Europe-bound refugees and migrants, despite a significant drop in arrivals this year.
A June deadline to reach an agreement over asylum seekers has passed, but a solution still remains out of reach.
During the meeting, the leaders will possibly talk about reforms to the EU's Dublin Regulation, which requires refugees to apply for asylum in the country they first arrive.
Other issues, such as a joint migration deal and agreeing on countries' responsibilities will also be on the table.
One of the most heavily criticised topics will be that of so-called ""disembarkation platforms"", offshore processing centres to screen refugees in countries such as Niger, Libya, Tunisia, Algeria, Morocco and Egypt.
Italy's newly elected government has been one of the main proponents of that plan in an attempt to minimise the number of people that arrive in the Mediterranean country.
In recent weeks, the country has denied rescue ships carrying refugees and migrants to dock at Italian ports.
One of the ships, the Aquarius, was forced to go to Spain in order to let the people off the ship.
The other one, the Lifeline, arrived in Malta earlier on Wednesday, but only after nearly a week being stuck at sea while EU leaders argued about the fate of the people on board.
The humanitarian ship docked in the Maltese capital, Valletta, but only after eight countries agreed to take a share of the 234 refugees and migrants on board.
Italy has joined other European countries such as Austria, Hungary, Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Poland, who have heavily criticised the EU for its attempt to distribute refugees evenly among EU members.
The alarmist attitude displayed by some of the European countries comes despite a sharp drop in the refugee arrivals this year.
The UN refugee agency expects 80,000 people to arrive by sea this year, which is about half the number from 2017.
Not only do Merkel's comments serve as a lead-in to Thursday's summit, they also are an attempt to address criticism from within her own coalition government and party.
Over the last couple of weeks, a vocal group of critics has emerged from within Merkel's CDU party who do not agree with her policy decisions on the refugee crisis.
Merkel came under pressure last week when her Interior Minister Horst Seehofer threatened to unilaterally implement an immigration ""master plan"" the chancellor is opposed to.
Seehofer has said he would give Merkel until after the EU summit to come up with a European solution.
Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz said last week he would reinstate border controls if Seehofer goes ahead with rejecting migrants at the German border.
The 31-year-old leader has been pushing for stronger European borders. He is set to take over the EU presidency, which is rotated every six months, on July 1.
Several other European leaders have criticised the anti-refugee stance some EU countries are now taking, including French President Emmanuel Macron who said nationalism and anti-migrant sentiments were spreading in Europe like ""leprosy"".
Last week, an emergency meeting was held between European leaders in preparation of Thursday's summit.

The 28-member bloc, which is deeply divided over how to stem the refugee flow, will discuss what it terms ""disembarkation platforms"" in countries such as Niger, Libya, Tunisia, Algeria, Morocco and Egypt.
Before the meeting, a document listing draft conclusions said: ""The European Council supports the development of the concept of regional disembarkation platforms in close cooperation with [UN refugee agency] UNHCR and IOM (the International Organisation for Migration).
""Such platforms should provide for rapid processing to distinguish between economic migrants and those in need of international protection, and reduce the incentive to embark on perilous journeys.""
No countries have so far agreed to participate in the scheme.
""The proposal was put to the head of our government a few months ago during a visit to Germany, it was also asked by Italy, and the answer is clear: no!"" Tahar Cherif, the Tunisian ambassador to the EU, told The Guardian.
Libyan Foreign Minister Ahmed Maiteeq said on Monday that his country ""categorically refuses"" to host the facilities.
Hassiba Hadj Sahraoui, MSF humanitarian affairs adviser
In a recent interview with Al Jazeera, Filippo Grandi, the United Nations' high commissioner for refugees, said: ""Africa has enough problems to deal with, and there's a high-risk asylum seekers could be stuck in transit countries.""
The EU, he said, ""has all the capacities to manage this flow in a fair way, without putting the burden on [a] poorer region that already hosts many refugees"".
Some reports said Albania was also being considered as a possible non-EU country to process refugees.
The Albanian mission to the EU told Al Jazeera they had not been contacted by the bloc with an official request, while Albania's Prime Minister Edi Rama rejected the proposal in an interview with Germany's Bild newspaper.
Details over how the facilities might work are scant.
Hassiba Hadj Sahraoui, humanitarian affairs adviser at Doctors Without Borders (known by its French initials, MSF), described the idea as ""passing the buck"".
""In all the scenarios, people are seen as commodities,"" she told Al Jazeera. ""We no longer see people as having rights, but some goods that are being passed around by countries in exchange for money or in exchange for political recognition.""
Versions of the idea have been around as early as 2015, when Brussels weighed using EU offices in ""countries of origin"" to screen asylum seekers.
Elizabeth Collett, the director of the Migration Policy Institute, said she was not surprised to hear that the prospect of outsourcing asylum facilities was being raised again.
""It's a way of heading off the harder line proposals that were starting to emerge,"" she told Al Jazeera, citing efforts by Austria and Denmark to send asylum seekers who had already arrived in the EU to centres outside of the bloc.
France and Italy, which recently clashed over migration, are among the countries supporting offshore centres.
Speaking alongside Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, French President Emmanuel Macron told reporters last week he backed the idea of ""branches of our asylum agencies to tackle this question on the other side"" of the Mediterranean.
Judith Sunderland, an associate director at Human Rights Watch's Europe and Central Asia division, said historical precedents for offshore processing included the US in Guantanamo Bay before it became a military detention facility and Australia in Nauru and Papua New Guinea.
""People ended up in limbo for very long periods of time, in dismal conditions with poor treatment and with huge consequences for their physical and mental health,"" she said.
The suggested countries, meanwhile, would likely have reservations about participating.
""You would have a lot of migrants and asylum seekers actually flocking there,"" Sunderland said. ""'Let's not get on the boat, let's just go to Tunisia or Albania and set up a shantytown around the detention centre.'
""I can imagine that governments would be thinking of those kind of consequences and what sort of tensions that would create in the surrounding communities.""
For Hadj Sahraoui, the experience of a resettlement scheme involving Niger illustrates why Europe's plans could be unrealistic and unattractive to potential host countries.
Late last year, Niger agreed to take in refugees who had been held in poor conditions in Libyan detention centres on a transit basis.
In March, the UNHCR announced it had temporarily suspended the operation because too few people were being resettled. Evacuations eventually resumed in May.
Of more than 1,400 refugees who landed in Niger from Libya, fewer than 200 have been resettled in Europe or North America.
""If European countries have not been able to transform words into actions with a very small group of people ... some of the most vulnerable people clearly falling under the refugee category, then [what would they do] elsewhere?"" Hadj Sahraoui said.
The UNHCR expects 80,000 people to arrive by sea this year, which is about half the number from 2017.
With the number of people arriving in Europe falling sharply, Sunderland said the migration debate is being politicised.
""It really is this engineered panic and it's taking the conversation in a very dangerous direction,"" Sunderland said.
There are also concerns that proposed host countries would not be able to safeguard human rights at processing centres.
In late 2017, UN human rights chief Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein called conditions in Libya ""an outrage to the conscience of humanity"".
On Monday, the Associated Press reported that Algeria had abandoned at least 13,000 people in the Sahara Desert over the past 14 months, expelling them without food or water.
Dimitris Avramopoulos, the EU's Commissioner for Migration, attempted to quell concerns at a press conference last week, when he told reporters the bloc would not create a ""Guantanamo Bay for migrants"".
""This is not what we are discussing or what has been proposed,"" he said. ""The Geneva Convention is here, it is alive, it is guiding us.""
Collett believes the idea will gain momentum at the summit.
The political climate has given way to the concept, she said.
""Given they can't seem to come to an agreement internally, talking about the external dimension [of migration policy] is far easier for EU member states.""

The humanitarian ship, Lifeline, docked in the capital Valletta on Wednesday, but only after eight countries agreed to take a share of the refugees and migrants on board.
Once the ship reached land, however, it was ordered impounded, and the captain of the German ship, Claus-Peter Reisch, was placed under investigation for allegedly breaching maritime regulations.
The Maltese government said Lifeline is not registered as a search and rescue ship, has failed to obey the orders of the Italy's coastguard, and often switched off its transponder to disguise its position, raising suspicion that the ship could be deliberately helping smugglers.
French President Emmanuel Macron also criticised the ship's captain, saying he ""acted against all the rules,"" by not turning the refugees and migrants over to Libyan authorities after they were found floating in rubber dinghies in Libyan waters.
The head of mission said Italian authorities opened the investigation against it, and suspects political motives under the new anti-migration government in Rome, because the Lifeline operated without problems last year.
""We started last year in September and we started here in Malta, too. We had five missions with this boat last year and rescued 549 people,"" Axel Steier, head of Lifeline mission told reporters in Valletta.
Humanitarian groups have pushed back, with Doctors without Borders, known by its French initials MSF, Amnesty International and two other groups asking to meet Macron over his assertion.
""Engineered panic and fear-mongering by European politicians over migrations is steering the EU towards very dangerous waters,"" Human Rights Watch said in a statement.
For the 234 people from Sub-Saharan countries on board, it was the end of an ordeal.
On the Lifeline's approach to Malta, the refugees and migrants crowded the deck wearing orange life vests, many waving, as it entered the main port under escort by a Maltese patrol boat.
The captain sounded the ship's horn with two long blasts to salute the weary passengers after their shared journey, and raised a yellow flag to signal permission to authorities to board and a Maltese flag as a courtesy for allowing the ship to dock.
One by one, the refugees and migrants were escorted off by officials and medical personnel in white coveralls and gloves.
A girl in pink shorts - one of five children on the ship - was cradled by an official.
One man walked unsteadily, leaning on a helper, while another wearing shorts and a white polo shirt was barefoot and wrapped in a red blanket.
Reisch, the ship's captain was the last to get off the ship, and he hugged the crew before getting into a waiting police car for questioning.
The refugees and migrants the ship carried will now have their asylum interviews in the EU.
But authorities say this is an individual arrangement, and there is no guarantee of safe harbour for future shiploads, Al Jazeera's John Psaropoulos, reporting from Valletta, said.
Italy's refusal to accept search and rescue ships has opened a new rift in the European Union.
Its 28 leaders are broadly divided between two camps - those who believe in collective action; and a growing opposition that says the EU needs to push its defence outward, setting up offshore processing camps in Africa and the Middle East, allowing no one to cross these waters.
Malta’s prime minister said the EU hardliners are attempting to politicise a practical issue.
""What I think it is is a situation where there were member states who showed that for them the values of European solidarity are not just found in the European treaties, but that we act together,"" Joseph Muscat said.
""I don't think it’s all about grandstanding and high-flying political declarations. It’s about how we act operationally, how we manage the situation.""
The standoff comes in advance of a two-day EU summit that begins Thursday, where Italy will propose a new system for distributing refugees and migrants more evenly among EU countries, along with ways to discourage people from leaving Africa.
Italy's Interior Minister Matteo Salvini, who visited Libya earlier this week, warned on Wednesday that there are 662,000 refugees and migrants from 40 countries in the northern African nation waiting to make their way to safer countries, mostly in Europe. He cited data from the International Organization for Migration.
The UN refugee agency said that this year alone, 1,000 people are missing and presumed dead crossing the Mediterranean Sea, usually in inadequate rubber dinghies organised by smugglers.

The deal, signed by President Salva Kiir and former Vice President Riek Machar, was reached in the Sudanese capital, Khartoum, in the presence of Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir and Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni.
The latest agreement boosts hopes that peace may soon be reached to end the country's four-and-a-half year civil war, which has killed tens of thousands, pushed millions to the brink of famine, and created Africa's largest refugee crisis since the 1994 Rwandan genocide.
""The ceasefire will end the war in South Sudan and open a (new) page,"" Machar told journalists after the signing ceremony.
The agreement calls for the opening of corridors for humanitarian aid, the release of prisoners of war and political detainees, the withdrawal of forces, and a transitional unity government to be formed within four months which will govern the country for 36 months.
It also allows members of the African Union and the East African regional bloc, Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) - that has been pushing peace efforts - to ""deploy the necessary forces to supervise the agreed permanent ceasefire"".
""The agreement is a shift in position especially with President Kiir, who previously said he did not expect to work with Machar in the same government,"" Ahmed Soliman, Chatham House researcher on South Sudan, told Al Jazeera.
One of the proposed points of the agreement was to have three different capitals for South Sudan to distribute power but a spokesman for Machar rejected this.
""We reject the three capitals - South Sudan is one country - and we reject foreign forces coming into our land,"" opposition spokesman Garang Mabior, said.
The Khartoum negotiations began on Monday and are scheduled to last for two weeks.
Another round of negotiations are scheduled to be held in the Kenyan capital, Nairobi, and the last round of talks is expected in the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa.
All sides are expected to agree to terms for the forming of a transitional government during the meetings.
""During the transitional period the country shall be prepared for national elections,"" according to the document signed on Wednesday. ""It is agreed that the election shall be open for all political parties and shall be free and fair,"" it said.
Analysts are calling for a more comprehensive and inclusive agreement to ensure other aggrieved opposition groups are not left out.
""We have to factor in lots of other opposition groups, including the South Sudan opposition alliance who are part of the IGAD peace process and mediation, as well as groups that are outside the process and other groups who are still carrying out armed resistance,"" Soliman said.
The risk of regional war motivated the mediation efforts of IGAD, which spearheaded the latest round of talks.
The provision for the African Union and IGAD to provide forces to oversee the ceasefire has not gone down well with the rebel group, and Garang said there was no guarantee the ceasefire will work.
""However, the involvement of the region is more serious now. We are cautiously optimistic,"" Opposition spokerman Garang said.
Rights campaigner Beny Gideon Mabor applauds plans to monitor the ceasefire as it would strenghten the process.
It would ""make it clear that sovereignity is not a barcade to do anything and expect to get away with it. The government must show responsibility to protect in line with the constitutional obligations and international law,"" Mabor told Al Jazeera.
Multiple attempts at peace deals have failed in the past leaving long-suffering citizens wondering whether this latest attempt at peace would fall apart as well.
Kiir and Machar had already signed a peace agreement in August 2015, which eventually collapsed in July 2016 when fighting broke out between the two sides in the capital, Juba.
The Khartoum negotiations came after a round of talks brokered by Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed last week in Addis Ababa faltered.
Rights activists are confident both parties would respect the ceasefire agreement reached in Khartoum.
Rights campaigner Beny Gideon Mabor
War broke out in December 2013 when Kiir accused his then-deputy Machar of plotting a coup, dashing the optimism that accompanied independence from Sudan just two years earlier.
Since then, the conflict has expanded and fighting has intensified with more than a dozen warring factions - most of them under the umbrella called South Sudan Opposition Alliance (SSOA) - who are not part of the Khartoum agreement.
Kiir's tendency to unilaterally make unpredictable decisions has eroded trust and re-integration offers have been therefore met with suspicison by members of the opposition.
But some refugees who fled fighting are hoping this agreement stands and all grey areas resolved so they can return home.
""It brings hope to suffering citizens in and out of the country but I'm sceptical that it won't guarantee safety as long as the issue of security arrangements remain blurred and not properly sorted out,"" Dhieu William, who fled to neighbouring Uganda in 2016, told Al Jazeera.
The war has left the oil-rich country's economy in tatters and agriculture heavily disrupted.
Seven million South Sudanese, more than half of the population, will need food aid in 2018, according to the United Nations.
During the war, oil production - which accounted for 98 percent of Juba revenues on its independence - plummeted to about 120,000 barrels a day from a peak of 350,000, according to the World Bank.
On the sidelines of the peace talks in Khartoum, Sudan and South Sudan agreed on a plan to double oil production from the south, but did not give details on how they would achieve this.
""We also reject the resumption of oil production prior to a comprehensive negotiated settlement,"" Mabior said.
Khartoum and Juba agreed earlier in June to repair oil infrastructure facilities destroyed by the war within three months to boost production and said a joint force would be established to protect the oilfields from attacks by rebel forces.
Renewed conflict would be catastrophic for South Sudan's economy with the two fighting factions facing a looming deadline to avert UN sanctions.

Shelling resumed for the ninth consecutive day on Thursday in the rebel-held towns of al-Musayfirah, Hirak and Dael in the suburbs of southwestern province, activists and medics told Al Jazeera.
Meanwhile, Russian warplanes have continued to bombard other villages east of the province, members of Syrian Civil Defence known as the White Helmets, said.
""Deraa has been completely burned to the ground,"" Jihad al-Ali, a 26-year-old paramedic in Deraa told Al Jazeera as he described the effect of the ongoing attacks since Wednesday evening.
Syrian government forces launched the military push on June 19 in an attempt to retake the southern provinces of Deraa, Quneitra and parts of Sweida, mostly held by opposition fighters.
The offensive follows a similar bombardment campaign that was launched in Eastern Ghouta earlier this year, which displaced tens of thousands of people.
The government's relentless bombardment has led to the destruction of civilian homes and numerous medical clinics and hospitals in several towns across Deraa.
""The infrastructure of homes and medical facilities belonging to the civil defence has been destroyed … It's like they were never there,"" Akram al-Mleihan, a pro-opposition activist in Hirak, told Al Jazeera as he described scenes of the attacks.
After capturing towns, including al-Lajah and Busr al-Harir on the western front, Assad's forces have intensified their attacks on the eastern side of the province, forcing thousands to flee.
Al-Mleihan noted that since the start of the offensive, government forces backed by Russian warplanes launched some 150 air strikes and barrel bombs.
The attacks also included the use of at least five ""elephant missiles,"" activists said, using the term to describe the intensity and sound of the mortar rockets.
""It's important to note that these missiles cause massive destruction,"" 30-year-old Amer Abazeid, a spokesperson for the Syrian Civil Defence in Deraa, told Al Jazeera.
Medics on the ground currently estimate that at least 90 people have been killed since June 19, but the death toll ""in reality is much larger"", Abazeid explained.
""No one knows exactly how many people died, how many are injured, and how many are missing at this time,"" he said.
""There are conflicting reports on the number of deaths and we're trying to verify everything to the best of our ability,"" Abazeid explained.
Due to the intensity of the attacks, civil defence teams across the province are struggling to document the exact number of injuries and deaths.
It has been especially challenging with the lack of medical facilities, which previously also served as gathering points to help medics tally figures.
At least 50,000 people have fled towards Jordan border amid intensified fighting, according to the United Nations.
Some have also fled towards the border with the occupied Golan Heights, while others await their fate in neighbouring Quneitra, a province west of Deraa.
Witnesses in the province told Al Jazeera those who fled have no access to food, medical assistance and other basic services.
""They sleep on hay,"" Ali from the White Helmets said. ""There's nowhere else to go.""
But UNHCR, the UN refugee agency, said there are community centres on both sides of the province that have been attending to the needs of thousands of displaced families.
Mohammed Howari, the UNHCR spokesperson in Jordan, said these centres that run in cooperation with local NGOs have distributed aid to 12,000 families so far.
""About 30,000 people have been provided with tents, blankets, food and hygiene kits [in Deraa],"" he told Al Jazeera from Amman.
According to Howari, those near the Jordanian border have not attempted to cross over, yet.
Earlier this week, Jordan's Minister of State Affairs Jumana Ghanimat said his country would be unable to host a new wave of Syrian refugees.
When asked how UNHCR would deal with an influx of refugees in Jordan, Howari said that the organisation would have to cut assistance to existing asylum seekers in the country.
""We're currently suffering from a severe lack of funding,"" he said.
""We only received 19 percent of our yearly budget - and we're already six months in,"" said Howari, who expects the number of displaced Syrians to rise.

She was part of a rotating group of about 30 people outside the facility who are calling for the abolishment of the facility and an end to immigration detention centres that have come under increased scrutiny since the administration of US President Donald Trump announced its ""zero-tolerance"" policy in April.
""We can't just afford to have symbolic rallies,"" Louise told Al Jazeera. ""We actually have to do things to stop ICE operations,"" she said. ""It's just imperative at this point.""
On Monday, #OccupyICENYC forced the agency to temporarily cancel a series of immigration hearings, with officials citing a need to ""ensure the safety of ICE employees, the court, the public and detainees"", according to local media. The facility resumed operations the following day.
#OccupyICENYC is part of nationwide ""occupy ICE"" movements that have successfully forced ICE facilities in several other US cities to temporarily halt their operations.
The New York City activists said they took their inspiration from and networked with other #OccupyICE groups, including those in Portland and Philadelphia. Similar protests have also taken place in Detroit and San Diego.
Just over a week ago, protesters in Portland, Oregon, forced a facility to shut its doors.
Protesters remained outside the Portland facility early on Wednesday, despite a warning from federal officials that arrests could take place at any time, according to local media.
Bowing to pressure, Trump signed an executive order last Wednesday, ending the most controversial part of the zero-tolerance policy: separating children from their parents at the border.
Following that order, the Department of Justice asked a California court to modify a federal court ruling that said migrant and refugee children can only be kept in detention for up to 20 days.
In Los Angeles, California, protesters set up camp outside the Roybal Federal Building.
""We don't consider it a victory if children who have been separated from their families are just reunited with their families, and they're still in cages,"" said Steven Ducey, who is part of the protests in Los Angeles.
""That's still immoral,"" Ducey told Al Jazeera by telephone. ""That's still completely against what this country should stand for.""
Ducey said most reactions by passers-by have been positive, though on one occasion opponents threw eggs at the protests.
ICE had not responded to Al Jazeera's request for comment at the time of publication. A spokeswoman for ICE told the Gothamist that New York protesters ""were spreading misinformation and advocating violence"".
The activists' call has won some support among Democratic politicians. On Monday, Representative Mark Pocan, a Democrat from Wisconsin, introduced legislation that would abolish the agency.
Earl Blumenauer, a Democrat representing Oregon's 3rd congressional district, called for the abolishment of ICE in a Medium post. ""We should abolish ICE and start over, focusing on our priorities to protect our families and our borders in a humane and thoughtful fashion,"" Blumenauer wrote.
On Tuesday, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez unseated incumbent Joe Crowley in a Democratic primary for New York's 14th congressional district. Ocasio-Cortez, a 28-year-old member of the Democratic Socialists of America, has also called for ICE to be shut down.
However, calls to abolish ICE face resistance from both Republicans and centrist Democrats. For example, Crowley, the fourth-ranking Democrat in the US House of Representatives, opposes abolishment.
Steve Ducey, Los Angeles
Louise said that the New York protesters were thinking about ""evolving the occupation to look at other ICE buildings that may be more appropriate"", adding they were considering spaces where they may ""have a greater impact occupying"".
Activists maintain ICE represents a punitive model of immigration enforcement that is both ineffective and inhumane.
""I'm not even thinking about what ICE looks like under Trump,"" Louise said. ""Under Obama's administration, I'd feel the same way. ICE just needs to go.""
Activists said that they would continue protesting outside of ICE detention facilities as long as possible.
""We're here. We're not going anywhere,"" said Steve Ducey in Los Angeles.
""We're going to continue to try and bring light to these issues and lift up the voices of oppressed peoples and people who have been in this struggle for a long time.""
Editor's note: Shortly after this article was published, the Metropolitan Anarchist Coordinating Council (MACC) said in a statement it was discontinuing its action outside the ICE facility on Varnick Street after it said it learned ""ICE is retaliating against the occupation by not holding bond hearings or allowing access to pro bono legal representation"". ICE has yet to comment on the MACC statement. An action continues at another site in New York, according to MACC.

The report titled We Will Destroy Everything: Military Responsibility for Crimes against Humanity in Rakhine State, Myanmar, calls for an international investigation into the army's brutal crackdown on the country's ethnic Rohingya minority in northern Rakhine state.
In the report published on Wednesday, Amnesty said that there is overwhelming, credible evidence that Myanmar's military Commander-in-Chief Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, and nine of his subordinates in the armed forces, as well as three others in the Border Guard police (BGP), played a key role in ethnic cleansing.
""Senior military officials knew - or should have known - that crimes against humanity were being committed, yet failed to use their command authority to prevent, stop or punish those crimes, and even attempted to whitewash the overwhelming majority of them in the aftermath,"" Amnesty said in a statement.
Those accused include Deputy Commander-in-Chief Vice Senior General Soe Win, Lieutenant General Aung Kyaw Zaw, Major General Maung Maung Soe and Brigadier General Khin Maung Soe.
Myanmar launched a military offensive in August last year after a Rohingya armed group carried out attacks on border security forces.
The ensuing violent crackdown has forced nearly 700,000 Rohingya to flee Rakhine state for neighbouring Bangladesh.
Since August 25, 2017, Myanmar's security forces committed nine distinct types of crimes against humanity, including murder, torture, deportation, rape, persecution, enforced disappearance and forced starvation, Amnesty's latest report said, as it put the responsibility on the army's top ranks.
The rights group said there was sufficient evidence to prompt an investigation into whether some or all military officials may have been ""directly involved in planning, ordering or committing murder, rape, torture and the burning of villages"".
Commenting on the findings, Matthew Wells, Amnesty's senior crisis adviser and one of the authors of the report, said: ""The evidence shows that the ethnic cleansing campaign implicates each level of the Myanmar military from soldiers on the ground, who carried out the atrocities, to field commanders who ordered or directly oversaw the crimes, to ultimately the senior-most levels of the military, including Senior General Min Aung Hlaing.""
Besides the 13 officials identified, Wells told Al Jazeera ""there are undoubtedly many others"".
Earlier this month, Amnesty shared their research in detailed letters with the Myanmar authorities, including the state counsellor, the military, and the police.
""The state counsellor's office confirmed receipt of our letter on June 13, but at the time of publication [of the report], Amnesty International had not received any response from the civilian or military authorities,"" Wells said.
Tun Khin, president of the Burmese Rohingya Organisation, UK (BROUK), said the report is ""another crucial piece of research to add to the already overwhelming body of evidence against Myanmar's security forces"".
""Many of Amnesty's findings chime with what we already knew - that soldiers killed, raped and burned villages indiscriminately, but this report makes it even clearer that this was part of an orchestrated campaign, going all the way up to Commander-in-Chief Min Aung Hlaing,"" Khin told Al Jazeera.
""The international community must act now and ensure that there is justice for Rohingya people.""
Since the start of the crisis in August, Amnesty and other rights groups have released a series of reports, documenting the alleged human rights violations committed, with accounts of sexual violence, torture, arson and killings.
Kyaw Win, chairman of the UK-based Justice for the Rohingya Minority (JFRM), said Amnesty's latest report comes as ""no surprise"".
""These people [Myanmar's army] have been committing war crimes and crimes against humanity since several decades and not only with the Rohingya population but also with other minorities - like the Kachin people, Shan people and Karen,"" he told Al Jazeera, in a phone interview from Thailand's capital, Bangkok.
""This has been continuously going on only because there is no accountability.""
Tun Khin, president of the Burmese Rohingya Organisation, UK.
Doctors Without Borders, known by its French initials, MSF, has estimated that at least 6,700 Rohingya were killed in the first month of the August crackdown alone.
The United Nations has denounced the army's bloody crackdown, with the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights calling it a ""textbook example of ethnic cleansing"".
Myanmar's military used the deadly attacks by Rohingya fighters as a pretext to launch the brutal crackdown on Rohingya, one of the most persecuted communities in the world.
They have been denied citizenship and basic human rights by Myanmar authories since 1982.
The International Criminal Court (ICC) has given Myanmar until July 27 to respond to a prosecution request that it consider a case on the alleged deportation of hundreds of thousands of Rohingya to Bangladesh.
This came after the Guardian newspaper published details of horrific acts of violence, the evidence of which has been sent to the ICC and forms part of the investigation.
Amnesty International as well as other rights groups and activists are calling for those in top military positions to be held accountable and prosecuted by the ICC.
""Those with blood on their hands - right up the chain of command to Senior General Min Aung Hlaing - must be held to account for their role in overseeing or carrying out crimes against humanity and other serious human rights violations under international law,"" said Amnesty's Matthew Wells in a statement.
Win from the Justice for the Rohingya Minority is hopeful that the ICC and universal jurisdiction can grant due justice to the Rohingya victims and prevent further atrocities.
""When the cases are strongly established, the people who are trying to travel around the world, they will be stopped and arrested and they should face consequences for the crimes they have committed,"" he said.
Tun Khin, of the Burmese Rohingya Organisation, also believes the ICC is Rohingya's ""main hope"".
""The international community must step in and members of the UN Security Council must refer the situation in Myanmar to the ICC immediately,"" Khin said.

Lawrence Adam, a Syrian journalist with the pro-opposition Nabaa media group in the suburbs of Deraa, said bombing raids had either completely destroyed medical centres or put them out of services in the opposition-controlled towns of Saida, Al-Harak, Al-Mseifra and Al-Jiza in Daraa province.
""The Al-Mseifra hospital has been completely damaged while hospitals in Saida, al-Harak and al-Jiza were put out of service after midnight, because of air strikes near the facilities,"" said Adam.
""The hospital in Al-Jiza was damaged after the regime targeted the town with three air strikes this morning. That's where a large number of civilians remain,"" added Adam.
He had no immediate information on the fate of medical staff or the patients inside the facilities.
Troops loyal to Damascus began ramping up air raids, rocket fire and the use of barrel bombs on rebel territory in Deraa and neighbouring Quneitra province on June 19.
Since then, dozens of people have been killed and more than 100 others have been wounded, according to Adam.
State news agency SANA has said air strikes on Deraa were a prelude to an ""advance into the southeastern quarter of the city"".
At least 45,000 people have fled intensified fighting in the southern Deraa province towards Jordan, the United Nations said on Tuesday.
Issuing an urgent call for action, Adam said civilians were fleeing their homes in unprecedented numbers, and have nowhere to go.
""The situation is critical. They (air raids) are targeting civilians from every corner. Families are stranded along the roads with no means to transport them,"" said Adam.
""The Jordanian borders are closed and the western suburbs are also under attack,"" Adam told Al Jazeera. ""We have nowhere to go.""
In response to the movement of fleeing civilians towards the Jordanian border, Jordan's Minister of State Affairs Jumana Ghanimat said on Sunday the country would be unable to host a new wave of Syrian refugees.
According to the UN's refugee agency, UNHCR, Jordan has the second-highest share of refugees compared with its population in the world - 89 per 1,000 inhabitants.
Jihad Hamza, a pro-opposition activist in Deraa, called on the international community to act quickly.
""We are terrified. Thousands of families are caught in villages being targeted by the government,"" said Hamza.
""There aren't enough tents or homes to take in the ones moving towards the borders any more.
""Without immediate action from the international community and organisations, we are facing a seriously dangerous situation,"" added Hamza.
The government's offensive is in breach of a ""de-escalation"" agreement negotiated by the US, Russia and Jordan in July 2017. Since then, the deal largely contained fighting in the southwest of Syria.
Assad said earlier this month that he was still pursuing a political solution for Syria's rebel-held southwest, but would use military force if the effort failed.
On Thursday, the United Nations warned that escalation in Syria's south could have dangerous repercussions for the estimated 750,000 civilians in the area.
Syria's war has killed hundreds of thousands of people and displaced millions since it started in 2011 with the brutal repression of anti-government protests.

On Monday, a conference held by the UN to raise money for basic services including food aid, medical care and sanitation, commenced in an attempt to help more than five million refugees in the occupied West Bank, Gaza Strip, Jordan, Lebanon, and war-torn Syria.
It is unclear how much was pledged by which countries against this year's shortfall of $250m facing the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian Refugees (UNRWA).
According to UN officials, the US, previously UNRWA's top donor, provided $364m to the agency last year, but only $60m this year.
The cuts made by US President Donald Trump in January are endangering basic services, including food assistance in the besieged Gaza Strip, as well as medical clinics and education services to about half a million children, Pierre Krahenbuhl, the agency's director, said.
""The situation of Palestinians is defined by great anxiety and uncertainty, first because Palestinian refugees do not see a solution to their plight on the horizon,"" he said at a briefing before the conference, which was also attended by Antonio Guterres, the UN secretary-general.
When Trump's administration announced in January that it was withholding $65 million of a planned $125 million funding installment for the relief agency, it was essentially cutting the only lifeline available to millions of registered refugees who have been relying on UNRWA's services for more than 70 years.
In a series of tweets, Trump had said: ""... We pay the Palestinians HUNDRED OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS a year and get no appreciation or respect.
""... With the Palestinians no longer willing to talk peace, why should we make any of these massive future payments to them?""
Trump's posts came less than a month after his controversial decision to recognise Jerusalem as Israel's capital, a move that prompted widespread international condemnation and led Palestinian leaders to say that they would ""no longer"" accept any peace plan put forward by the US.
Al Jazeera's James Bay, reporting from the UN headquarters in New York, said the UN has for months been trying to fill UNRWA's budget gap.
""It appears there are new funds coming from the European Union, from Mexico, from Sweden and from Belgium - and other countries like the UK, are bringing forward some of their funding,"" Bays said.
""The total amounts though are nowhere near the shortfall of $250m, and the UN is still desperately looking for further funding,"" he said.
In March, a summit in Rome co-organised by Jordan, Sweden, and Egypt to help fund the agency managed to raise $100m in aid pledges, but still fell $350m short.
The US government released $60m in January so UNRWA could pay teachers and health workers and keep schools and medical services open in Gaza and the West Bank, but made clear that its donations would be dependent on major reforms.
Last week, State Department spokesperson Heather Nauert said the agency needed to ""determine a way to better manage its budgeting and its finances.""
The siege on Gaza, imposed by Israel and Egypt, that has trapped more than two million Palestinians since 2006, has left residents of the enclave with limited access to water and electricity, and the cuts have proved to be more catastrophic.
In a statement, Hamas, the Palestinian political movement that governs the Gaza Strip, called on the UN to take necessary steps towards incorporating UNRWA's aid money as part of the body's main budget.
""The UN should take a responsible decision by approving the agency's budget as part of its primary budget,"" the Gaza-based group said on Monday.
""It is unacceptable that Palestinian refugees continue to suffer; that their lives must depend on international political calculations and racist US decisions that favor the Israeli occupation at the expense of [Palestinian refugees'] inalienable rights,"" the statement read.
During the UN meeting, Krahenbuhl warned that one million people were at risk of losing access to food in the strip.
In its statement, Hamas also called on Arab states to ""live up to their pledges"" and pitch in to the funding of the agency.

Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Kevin McAleenan said on Monday that Trump's executive order last week to stop splitting migrant and refugee families at the border required a temporary halt in handing over parents and guardians for prosecution, unless they had a criminal history or the child's welfare was in question.
Trump's order came amid widespread outrage over the separation of more than 2,300 migrant and refugee families at the border.
McAleenan's announcement effectively reverts this portion of the policy back to the ""catch and release"" approach of former President Barack Obama, who was also heavily criticised for his harsh immigration strategy. Trump himself was a staunch critic of the policy, saying it invited criminals and violence into the country - an assertion that rights groups have said is false.
McAleenan insisted that the White House's zero tolerance approach to immigration remained intact.
Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced the zero tolerance policy in April, saying that any person caught crossing the border between official ports of entry would be prosecuted.
On Monday, he defended the approach in a speech in Nevada, somewhat contradicting what McAleenan said just hours later.
""We're going to continue to prosecute those adults who enter here illegally. We're going to do everything in our power, however, to avoid separating families. All federal agencies are working hard to accomplish this goal,"" Sessions said.
Last week, the Department of Justice asked a California court to modify a federal court ruling that said migrant and refugee children can only be kept in detention for up to 20 days. Lawyers have said that the move is unlikely to hold up in the courts.
Addressing reporters in Texas, McAleenan said he stopped sending cases of parents to prosecutors ""within hours"" after Trump signed an executive order last week to cease the separations.
The commissioner and Sessions insisted that the administration's policy remains in effect, even though immigrant parents are no longer being prosecuted under the new guidelines McAleenan said he is working on a plan to resume prosecutions.
""We can work on a plan where adults who bring kids across, who violate our laws, who risk their lives at the border could be prosecuted without an extended separation from their children,"" he said. ""We're looking at how to implement that now.""
White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders stressed that the administration's reversal was only temporary because the government is running out of resources.
""This will only last a short amount of time, because we're going to run out of space, we're going to run out of resources in order to keep people together,"" she said.
Monday's announcement came after Trump repeated his call to deprive undocumented immigrations of due process.
""Hiring many thousands of judges, and going through a long and complicated legal process, is not the way to go - will always be dysfunctional,"" the president said on Twitter.
""People must simply be stopped at the Border and told they cannot come into the US illegally. Children brought back to their country,"" he added.
That suggestion has been slammed by rights groups and lawyers as ""unconstitutional"" and ""illegal"".
There were also continued reports of confusion among mothers and fathers who struggled to reunite with their children who were separated.
A mother from Guatemala wiped tears from her eyes Monday as she told reporters in El Paso, Texas, about her 4-year-old son being taken away after they crossed the border.
The boy ended up at a shelter in New York. When the mother contacted a social worker to speak with her son, she was told that the child was angry and didn't want to talk because he believed his mother had abandoned him.
The mother was one of five parents who described their ordeals to reporters in El Paso. Speaking Spanish and all wearing ankle bracelets, the parents said they have not been told when they will see their sons and daughters again.
Amid the confusion, some Democratic members of Congress reiterated their frustrations that the Trump administration had not released its plan for reunifying families.
As many as 2,300 children were separated from their migrant parents from the time the administration adopted the zero-tolerance policy until June 9, officials have said.
McAleenan said that 538 children that had been separated since May had been reunited with their families. The administration has said it has created a task force to work on reuniting families, but it remains unclear how long the process may take, and there have been reports of families still unsure where exactly their children are located.
US defence officials said the administration had chosen two military bases in Texas to house arrested migrants. An official says Fort Bliss will house families and Goodfellow Air Force Base will house hold unaccompanied children. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak on the record about a pending announcement.
The temporary shelter at Tornillo was close to its 360-person capacity. Reporters were allowed Monday to briefly visit the shelter, where more than 320 children ages 13 to 17 are being held in air conditioned tents.
About half were from Guatemala, and 23 of the children had been separated from adults who accompanied them across the border.
Reporters were not allowed to enter any tents holding children. Two girls who stopped briefly in front of reporters said that they were doing well.
A senior manager, who said he was speaking in an individual capacity, told reporters who were touring the Tornillo facility that the family separations were a ""dumb, stupid decision"".

https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/06/supreme-court-upholds-trump-travel-ban-180626142504629.html,refugee,1148,Tue Jun 26 2018 17:34:37 GMT+0000,None,Top US court backs Trump travel ban on Muslim-majority countries,"The United States Supreme Court has upheld President Donald Trump's controversial order blocking entry by people from several Muslim-majority countries, a decision described as ""disappointing"" and ""worrying"" by advocacy groups.
In a 5-4 decision on Tuesday, the high court found that Trump's action was ""squarely within the scope of presidential authority"" under US immigration law and rejected a challenge that it discriminated against Muslims or exceeded his authority.
The current ban, announced in September and widely criticised by human rights and refugee advocacy groups, prohibits entry into the US by most people from Iran , Libya, Somalia, Syria and Yemen.
It also affects two non-Muslim majority countries, blocking travelers from North Korea and some Venezuelan government officials and their families.
A sixth majority Muslim country, Chad, was removed from the list in April after improving ""its identity-management and information sharing practices,"" Trump said in a proclamation.
Chief Justice John Roberts wrote the majority opinion, joined by his four conservative colleagues.
He rejected the challengers' claim of anti-Muslim bias, but was careful not to endorse either Trump's provocative statements about immigration in general and Muslims in particular.
""We express no view on the soundness of the policy,"" Roberts wrote.
Following the Supreme Court's announcement, Trump hailed the decision as ""a moment of profound vindication"" following ""months of hysterical commentary from the media and Democratic politicians who refuse to do what it takes to secure our border and our country"".
SUPREME COURT UPHOLDS TRUMP TRAVEL BAN. Wow!
Lower courts had previously blocked the travel ban, the third version of a policy Trump first pursued a week after taking office in January 2017. But on December 4, the high court allowed it to go fully into effect while the legal challenge continued.
Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote in a dissent that based on the evidence in the case ""a reasonable observer would conclude that the Proclamation was motivated by anti-Muslim animus"".
She said her colleagues arrived at the opposite result by ""ignoring the facts, misconstruing our legal precedent, and turning a blind eye to the pain and suffering the Proclamation inflicts upon countless families and individuals, many of whom are United States citizens"".
Sotomayor likened the case to the discredited Korematsu V. US decision that upheld the detention of Japanese-Americans during World War II.
The challengers, led by the state of Hawaii, argued the policy was motivated by Trump's enmity towards Muslims.
The Supreme Court on Tuesday held that the challengers had failed to show that the ban violates either US immigration law or the Constitution's First Amendment prohibition on the government favouring one religion over another.
The White House maintains the ban targets individuals from countries that have failed to provide enough information to allow for proper vetting of prospective travellers. Trump also says it is needed on matters of national security.
When the first version of the ban was announced shortly after Trump took office, protests erupted nationwide, with many taking to airports and the streets to denounce the move as ""unconstitutional"".
Human rights activists said the court's decision represented ""a dreadful day for our country"".
In 1944, the Supreme Court allowed the US government to imprison Japanese Americans solely because of their national origin and ethnicity, based on empty claims of national security. It’s one of the most shameful chapters of US history, and today’s decision now joins it.
This is a dreadful day for our country. Supreme Court upholds the president's Muslim ban, refusing to consider what the president has consistently proclaimed about his purpose. But we Americans will fight on to express the will of the people to uphold equality and freedom.
SCOTUS ruling reminds us: The true war against religious freedom in this country is, and has always been, discrimination against minority religious groups. What is generally discussed in D.C. as ""religious freedom"" is Christian supremacy in disguise. #NoMuslimBanEver
To generalize and discriminate against an entire group based on the actions of few makes zero sense. Men commit about 90% of violent crimes but there’s no one saying we should try and keep them out of our country. #NoMuslimBanEver

“Slavery was legal. Segregation was legal. Internment of Japanese was legal. Just because the #SCOTUS decides something is legal doesn’t make it right or moral.” #NoMuslimBanEver #StandWithMuslims pic.twitter.com/eUg6NrFhzu
Nihad Awad, national executive director of the Council on American- Islamic Relations described the court's decision as ""disappointing"".
""The Supreme Court decision today has given the Trump administration a free hand to reinject discrimination against a particular faith back to our immigration system which was rejected more than 50 years ago.
""The Supreme Court's decision ignored the fact that this president and candidate has targeted a particular faith community which is Muslims, here and abroad.""
Debra Hauser, President of Advocates for Youth, said in a statement that the association was appalled with the court's decision to uphold the ban.
""This Administration continues to invoke policies that propagate hate, embolden bigots, and incite violence. We should be ashamed of where this Administration has led us - and we're ashamed that our highest court has accepted the Administration's harmful rhetoric and actions to persecute some of the world's most vulnerable people. We are a nation of immigrants - and no twisted legal justification can change that,"" Hauser said.
""While Trump continues to manufacture policies that profile individuals and attack immigrants, young people will instead center our communities and be the moral compass and humanity this country so desperately needs, when it feels like our institutions are blatantly not.
Muslim advocates said they a also concerned that the administration will target other countries as well as American citizens and lawful, permanent US residents of a Muslim background.
Bomb Muslims overseas, turn away Muslim refugees, and systematically discriminate against your own Muslim citizens. #America2018 #MuslimBan https://t.co/PPvozSJSz6
#SCOTUS failed us today. They decided on the side of xenophobia and racism. This is a devastating decision for Muslim and Refugee communities. More families separated by a white supremacist agenda. #NoMuslimBanEver #StandWithMuslims
Democratic Rep. Keith Ellison of Minnesota, the first Muslim elected to Congress said the decision ""will someday serve as a marker of shame"", comparing the ban and ruling to the internment of Japanese-Americans during World War II.
SCOTUS upholding Muslim/Travel ban is reminiscent of Taney Court’s Dred Scott decision, in which an partisan court reached a discriminatory holding to support a futile attempt at suppressing human dignity. The dustbin of history awaits this one too. https://t.co/FVSYJbbFVw
Al Jazeera's Kristen Saloomey reporting from New York said that the court's ruling is a ""major victory"" for Trump.
She said that the Trump administration added some countries that were not Muslim majority to the list arguing that this was for national security and not based on religion
""With those changes the Supreme Court is basically saying that this is within the president's authority to do this.""

The Alexander Maersk, which had been in limbo for the last couple of days about wether or not it could dock in Italy, was allowed to enter the port of the Sicilian town of Pozzallo on Tuesday.
""We will accept these people with our customary humanity,"" Pozzallo mayor Roberto Ammatuna said according to local news reports.
""Today is an important day because it has showed that solidarity is still a widespread feeling.""
The news comes as Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte announced on Tuesday that the rescue ship Lifeline, stranded for days in the Mediterranean, would go to Malta with Italy agreeing to welcome some of the hundreds of people on board.
""I just got off the phone with (Maltese) president Muscat: the NGO ship Lifeline will dock in Malta,"" said Conte in a statement.
The Lifeline was in limbo for days as it was blocked by Italy and Malta from entering their ports.
The Alexander Maersk ship took on 113 people saved by the Lifeline rescue ship last Friday after being told to do so by the Italian coastguard.
However, after taking on board the refugees, Italy's Interior Minister Matteo Salvini did not allow the ship to dock in Italy to drop them off.
The ship remained anchored about three nautical miles off the Sicilian coast.
During the weekend, five people were brought to Italy because of medical reasons. However, the remaining 108 people stayed behind on the ship.
On Monday, Pozzallo Mayor Ammatuma and National Guarantor for the Rights of Persons Detained or Deprived of Liberty, Mauro Palma, asked Salvini to also let the other refugees enter Italy.
Their pleas were echoed by Danish Immigration Minister Inger Stojberg, who called on Italy to let the refugees in.
She added that the situation was costing the Danish Maersk shipping company ""a lot of money"".
On Monday evening, Salvini, who is not only interior minister but also leader of the far-right League party, said the Alexander Maersk could dock in Sicily.
The refugees on the ship were saved by Lifeline, part of the German NGO mission that is patrolling the Mediterranean to rescue refugees trying to make the dangerous crossing from North Africa to Europe.
The Lifeline currently has 234 refugees on board, but it is not allowed to dock in Italy or Malta.
According to French government spokesman Benjamin Griveaux a solution for that crisis seems closer.
""As I speak, a European solution seems to be emerging: (it) would be a docking in Malta,"" Griveaux told RTL Radio. The Lifeline rescued the migrants, including children and pregnant women on Thursday, but the vessel has been stranded in the Mediterranean since then.
Italy has turned away several rescue vessels in recent weeks, with its new populist government demanding greater solidarity from reluctant fellow EU states.
One of the ships, the Aquarius, was forced to travel to Spain to offload the refugees it had saved.
Under the European Union's so-called Dublin rules, asylum-seekers must be processed in the country where they first arrive, usually Italy, Greece or Spain.
EU leaders last December had set the end of June as a deadline to establish a permanent mechanism to distribute asylum-seekers throughout the bloc - but an agreement has proved elusive.
Last weekend, EU leaders held a meeting to discuss the issue. French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel vowed to forge ahead with like-minded leaders on ways to reduce the number of people arriving and share responsibility for those who land on Europe's shores.
Merkel, who is scrambling to prevent a mutiny in her government over migration, admitted there were still ""some differences"" but also ""a great deal of common ground"".

The travel ban case was argued on April 25, with the court's conservative majority signalling support for Trump's policy in a significant test of presidential powers.

Interior Minister Joachim Brudzinski said that ""we have to declare unequivocally that in this debate, the Visegrad Group was right"", referring also to Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic.
Speaking after a meeting in Budapest, Brudzinski said that the four countries were united ""against the uncontrolled influx of migrants"".
Hungarian Interior Minister Sandor Pinter, who hosted the meeting, said the Visegrad Group was helping Balkan countries like Serbia, Macedonia, Albania and Bosnia-Herzegovina to oppose migration and tackle human trafficking.
Earlier this week, the leaders of Germany, France and about a dozen other European Union (EU) nations converged on Brussels for an afternoon of informal talks on differences over migration ahead of a full EU summit.
The Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia refused to attend and reject taking in migrants in general.
The upcoming EU summit on migration policy will take place on June 28 and 29.
Yet German Chancellor Angela Merkel said she was not optimistic about the prospects of finding consensus among all EU members.
""We know that no solution will be reached on Thursday and Friday at the level of the 28 member states … on the overall issue of migration,"" she said on Sunday during a visit to Beirut.
Merkel, who is scrambling to prevent a mutiny in her government over migration, admitted there were still ""some differences"" but also ""a great deal of common ground"" suggesting ""bilateral or trilateral agreements for mutual benefit"" instead.
The EU member states have been stricken with a long-standing deadlock over who should take in refugees who land in Italy and other European countries.
Hundreds of people fleeing conflict and persecution at home are caught in the midst of a worsening row over how to deal with the influx against a backdrop of mass drownings in the Mediterranean in recent years.
Italy, a country on the front line of the crisis, has turned away rescue vessels, with its new populist government demanding greater solidarity from reluctant fellow EU states.
The United Nations' refugee agency has said it expects about 80,000 people to arrive by sea this year, which is about half the number from 2017. In 2015, more than one million migrants arrived in Europe.

Clashes broke out on Tuesday between pro-government forces, which have amassed on the outskirts of the town of Basr al-Harir, as fighting between the two sides escalated.
""At least 200 air strikes and 150 barrel bombs targeted Basr al-Harir this morning as government forces moved in on the village,"" said Jihad Hamza, a pro-opposition activist in Deraa.
""Rebel fighters are organising themselves to push back the assault,"" he added.
At least 45,000 people have fled intensified fighting in the southern Deraa province towards Jordan, according to the United Nations.
Syrian government forces launched the military push on June 19 aiming to retake the southern provinces of Deraa, Quneitra and parts of Sweida, still mostly held by opposition fighters.
Since then, at least 41 people have been killed and more than 100 others were wounded, according to Lawrence Adam, a journalist with the activist-run Nabaa media group in the suburbs of Deraa.
""At least 27 of those killed were civilians, including five children and nine women,"" Adam told Al Jazeera on Monday.
Issuing an urgent call for action, Adam said the civilians are fleeing to camps and villages along the borders with Jordan and the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights ""where little is available"".
""If the international community doesn't respond quickly, we're going to be facing a disaster soon,"" said Adam.
On Thursday, the United Nations warned that escalation in Syria's south could have dangerous repercussions for the estimated 750,000 civilians in the area.
After a string of military victories earlier this year in areas surrounding the capital, Damascus, the Assad government set its sights on re-taking rebel-held areas in southern Syria - either through negotiations or militarily.
State media has said the government is shelling what it called ""terrorist posts"" northeast of Deraa to destroy their weaponry. Government troops have also been amassing in the nearby Sweida province.
But sources on the ground said the assault has also targeted civilians in the eastern and western areas surrounding Deraa city.
""Families living in the eastern suburbs of Deraa continue to flee their homes towards villages and camps along the Jordanian borders that remain under rebel control or are not affected by the bombardment,"" said Sami, a pro-opposition activist in the eastern side of the Deraa suburbs.
According to the activist, whose name was changed for security reasons, at least 10 villages in Deraa are now mostly empty.
On the western side of the province, families fleeing their homes have moved to villages along the occupied Golan Heights, according to Hamza, the pro-opposition activist in Deraa.
""Families are terrified and are leaving in a rush to save their lives,"" said Hamza.
""Just this morning, about 40 barrel bombs and air strikes targeted family homes in small villages on the western side of the province,"" he added.
Rebel factions hold parts of Deraa city and areas to its west and east. The rebels also control areas along the borders with Jordan and the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights.
In recent weeks, Syrian government forces dropped leaflets over the southern provinces, warning of the impending military operations and calling on the rebels to surrender.
Some leaflets compared the area to the Damascus suburb of Eastern Ghouta - captured in April after a ferocious Russian-backed offensive that reportedly killed about 1,500 civilians - and urged its residents to ""cooperate"" with the government forces to drive out armed groups.
Sami, the pro-opposition activist, said the families leaving their homes in Deraa ""have no intention of supporting Assad who forced them to flee"".
""But people are afraid of what is yet to come. They aren't waiting around to see it because they know what happened in Ghouta,"" he added.
In response to the movement of fleeing civilians towards the Jordanian border, Jordan's Minister of State Affairs Jumana Ghanimat said on Sunday the country would be unable to host a new wave of Syrian refugees.
According to the UN's refugee agency, UNHCR, Jordan has the second-highest share of refugees compared with its population in the world - 89 per 1,000 inhabitants.
""Everyone should cooperate to deal with any new wave of displacement within Syria's borders,"" Ghanimat was quoted as saying by AFP news agency, adding that Jordan would work with ""concerned organisations"" to find an arrangement for the displaced inside Syria.
The Assad government's offensive meanwhile is undermining a ""de-escalation"" agreement negotiated by the US, Russia and Jordan in July 2017. Since then, the deal contained fighting in the southwest of Syria.
Assad said earlier this mont that he was still pursuing a political solution for Syria's rebel-held southwest, but would use military force if the effort failed.
Responding to Assad's statements, the US state department said on June 14 that any government assault would ""broaden the conflict"" and threatened ""firm and appropriate measures in response"".
Speaking to Iranian TV last week, Assad said that while talks between the Russians, Americans and Israelis are still ""ongoing"", Iran's presence in the area was not negotiable.
Tehran is a close ally of the Assad government, and its advisers are embedded with his troops. Iranian-backed armed groups are also believed to be deployed in the area.
Israel, on its part, is believed to be seeking an agreement in which Iran and its allied militias would withdraw from the occupied Golan Heights.
Syria's war has killed hundreds of thousands of people and displaced millions since it started in 2011 with the brutal repression of anti-government protests.

The organisation surveyed nearly 550 experts focused on women's issues, asking them to rank countries based on a number of key issues, including access to healthcare, prevalence of sexual abuse and discrimination.
The experts ranked India as the most dangerous country for women.
""The world's second most populous nation, with 1.3 billion people, ranked as the most dangerous on three of the topic questions - the risk of sexual violence and harassment against women, the danger women face from cultural, tribal and traditional practices, and the country where women are most in danger of human trafficking including forced labour, sex slavery and domestic servitude,"" the findings said.
The report specifically pointed to the 2012 gang rape and murder of Jyoti Singh, a 23-year-old physiotherapy student.
The rape of Singh caused widespread protests and drew international attention over violence against women.
The last time Thomson Reuters Foundation conducted the poll, India ranked fourth overall.
This year's survey listed Afghanistan as the second most dangerous country for women.
The country was ranked the most dangerous on the topics of non-sexual violence, including conflicted-related violence and domestic abuse, access to healthcare and access to economic resources.
The DRC was ranked seventh. It came in second in the 2011 poll.
On a visit to the DRC earlier this year, Norwegian Refugee Council chief Jan Egeland said that women and children were being exposed to the ""worst sexual abuse ever"".
According to the United Nations, about 4.3 million people are internally displaced in the country due to violence aggravated by a political crisis sparked by President Joseph Kabila's refusal to step down at the end of his mandate in 2016.
The United States was listed as the 10th most dangerous country for women, ranking third on the question of sexual violence and sixth on the issue of non-sexual violence.
Thomson Reuters Foundation pointed out that the survey was conducted after the #MeToo movement went viral last year after several women accused prominent Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein of sexual abuse.
Weinstein has since pleaded not guilty to rape and criminal sex act charges.
#MeToo has since grown into a global movement against sexual violence against women, with many exposing the prevalence of sexual harassment and abuse in the workspace worldwide.
Almost one in five women have been raped, and more than one in three experienced rape, violence or stalking by an intimate partner in the US, according to 2010 statistics by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
It is worth noting that no Latin American country topped the list, despite many countries having high rates of femicide and 49 countries having no laws to protect women from domestic violence, according to UN Women.
Some including, Cindy Southworth, executive vice president at the National Network to End Domestic Violence, said that media coverage of #MeToo in the US may have attributed to this.
""People watch the US,"" she told Reuters news agency. ""They watch our elections. They watch our media coverage. They watch our celebrity violence against women cases.
""The perception is understandable, but not based on reality.""
Globally, it is estimated that one in three women experience physical or sexual violence during her lifetime, and nearly 750 million women and girls married before their 18th birthday.
Other countries that ranked among the top 10 were Somalia, Saudi Arabia, Nigeria, Pakistan and Yemen.
The Thomson Reuters Foundation poll was a repeat of a similar survey in 2011 that found Afghanistan, DRC, Pakistan, India, and Somalia were seen as the most dangerous countries for women.

The military, also referred to as Tatmadaw, announced late on Monday in a Facebook post that Major General Maung Maung Soe, the former head of the western command in Rakhine, had been ""purged"" for poor performance.
Since August last year, more than 700,000 Muslim-majority Rohingya have been forced to flee Rakhine state after military launched security operation against one of the most persecuted cummunities in the world.
The army said the operation was in response to deadly attacks carried out by an armed Rohingya group.
The announcement came after the EU said Soe was among seven security officials hit with travel bans and asset freezes, but Myanmar did not link his sacking to the new sanctions.
The Facebook post said Soe was first reassigned last November, and that his removal from his position in the western command was to ""inspect his responsibility over his weakness while working for Rakhine state stability"".
The brutal military operation has forced tens of thousands of Rohingya to take refuge in the neighbouring Bangladesh, in what the United Nations said amounts to ""ethnic cleansing"".
The government has come under fire for taking little punitive action against the military, which has maintained its troops were responding to attacks by Rohingya armed groups.
Soe was among the target of US sanctions last year over the Rohingya crisis.
The government statement also said that Lieutenant General Aung Kyaw Zaw - commander of the bureau of special operations and also on the EU list - was permitted to resign in May for health reasons and ""weakness in serving duty"".
The latest development comes also comes just a day after Canada announced it was imposing sanctions against the same seven figures named by the EU.
The EU said the individuals were targeted because of their ""involvement in or association with atrocities and serious human rights violations committed against the Rohingya population in Rakhine state in the second half of 2017"".
""These violations include unlawful killings, sexual violence and the systematic burning of Rohingya houses and buildings.""
The EU sanctions will freeze the assets of the officers and prohibit them from travelling to any European member state.
Most of Myanmar's Rohingya refugees are living in squalid camps in neighbouring Bangladesh, and say they are too afraid to return to Myanmar though both countries have signed a repatriation deal.
Many refugees say they will not return without a basic guarantee of protection.
The UN signed a deal with Myanmar this month to allow its agencies to assess conditions on the ground in Rakhine state, which they say are not yet ripe for a safe and voluntary return.
Myanmar's de facto leader Aung San Suu Kyi has faced global criticism for not standing up for the Rohingya, though supporters say she has little control over army actions.

Sixteen of the EU's 28 leaders held emergency talks in Brussels on Sunday to find a way forward despite a long-standing deadlock over who should take in refugees who land in Italy and other European countries.
Hundreds of people fleeing conflict and persecution at home are caught in the midst of a worsening row over how to deal with the influx against a backdrop of mass drownings in the Mediterranean in recent years.
Italy, a country on the front line of the crisis, has turned away rescue vessels, with its new populist government demanding greater solidarity from reluctant fellow EU states.
One boat, the Lifeline, remained in limbo on Sunday with 239 Africans on board, including pregnant women and children, with Malta and Italy refusing to take it in, after the Aquarius suffered a similar fate until it was allowed to dock in Spain.
Italy's far-right Interior Minister Matteo Salvini bluntly told foreign charities on Sunday to stop rescuing migrants and refugees off Libya, where one group said 1,000 people were on boats in distress.
He accused them of abetting people smugglers.
But the German operators of the Lifeline hit out at Salvini for referring to its passengers as a consignment of ""human flesh"".
""Dear Matteo Salvini, we have no meat on board, but humans,"" it said in a statement.
The plight of the stranded migrants lent a sense of urgency to the meeting in Brussels, which was riven with divisions and snubbed by countries taking a hardline on the issue.
French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel vowed to forge ahead with like-minded leaders on ways to reduce migrant flows and share responsibility for those who land on Europe's shores.
Merkel, who is scrambling to prevent a mutiny in her government over migration, admitted there were still ""some differences"" but also ""a great deal of common ground"".
Macron pointed to the sharp drop in Mediterranean crossings since 2015 as proof that the crisis is now mainly ""political"", fuelled by the rise of anti-immigration populists.
Italy has accused him of ""arrogance"" and placed the responsibility for saving migrants and refugees in the Mediterranean squarely at the feet of Libya, much of which is lawless.
Officials warn that a new surge of migrants and refugees could trigger the collapse of free travel within the EU, its signature achievement.
""Our top priority, if we want to save free movement within the Schengen area, is to ensure real, strict controls of the EU's external borders,"" Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel said.
Sunday's meeting paves the way for a full EU summit on Thursday and Friday.
Merkel, however, downplayed the likelihood of ""an overall solution to the migration problem"", suggesting ""bilateral or trilateral agreements for mutual benefit"" instead.
Macron urged a European solution, ""whether that is cooperation among 28 or among several countries that decide to move forward together"".
Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovakia, which have refused to take in refugees from overstretched countries such as Italy and Greece, boycotted the Brussels meeting.
Macron has infuriated Italy by accusing it of ""irresponsibility"" for turning away migrant vessels and denouncing the ""leprosy"" of rising populism.
Italy has, in turn, accused France of hypocrisy, noting that Paris keeps pushing migrants back across their shared border.
Under the EU's so-called Dublin rules, asylum-seekers must be processed in the country where they first arrive, usually Italy, Greece and Spain.
EU leaders last December had set the end of June as a deadline to establish a permanent mechanism to distribute asylum-seekers throughout the bloc -- but an agreement has proved elusive.
France and Spain have called for asylum-seekers to be kept in closed centres until their claims are processed - a proposal that Rome fears would turn Italy into ""a refugee camp for all of Europe"".
The issue has raised tensions in Germany, where Merkel is trying to placate a coalition ally opposed to taking in more migrants and refugees.
Her hardline Interior Minister Horst Seehofer has given her until the end of June to find a European deal to curb new arrivals.
If that fails, he has vowed to order border police to turn back migrants and refugees, which means many will likely have to return to Italy.
In a counter-proposal, Italy on Sunday called for migrant ""protection centres"" to be set up in several EU countries to relieve overcrowding in its facilities and also demanded more aid for African countries that fight human trafficking.
EU leaders also discussed measures to strengthen the external borders - an issue on which there is consensus - and proposals for centres in countries outside the bloc to separate genuine war refugees from economic migrants.
Cooperation deals with Turkey and Libya have sharply cut the flow of migrants to Europe since a 2015 peak of over one million.

Some never make it out alive.
The expelled migrants and refugees can be seen coming over the horizon by the hundreds, appearing at first as specks in the distance under temperatures of up to 48 degrees Celsius.
In Niger, where the majority head, the lucky ones limp across a desolate 15km no-man's-land to the border village of Assamaka.
Others wander for days before a United Nations rescue squad can find them.
Untold numbers perish; nearly all of the more than two dozen survivors interviewed by The Associated Press news agency told of people in their groups, who simply vanished into the Sahara.
""Women were lying dead, men... Other people got missing in the desert because they didn't know the way,"" said Janet Kamara, who was pregnant at the time.
""Everybody was just on their own.""
In a voice almost devoid of feeling, she recalled at least two nights in the open before her group was rescued, but said she lost track of time.
""I lost my son, my child,"" said Kamara, who is Liberian.
Another woman in her early twenties also went into labor and lost her baby, she said.
Algeria's mass expulsions have picked up since October 2017, as the European Union renewed pressure on North African countries to head off migrants and refugees going north to Europe via the Mediterranean Sea or the barrier fences with Spain.
An EU spokesperson said the EU was aware of what Algeria was doing, but that ""sovereign countries"" can expel migrants and refugees as long as they comply with international law.
Unlike Niger, Algeria takes none of the EU money intended to help with the migration and refugee crisis, although it did receive $111.3m in aid from Europe between 2014 and 2017.
Algeria provides no figures for its involuntary expulsions. But the number of people crossing on foot to Niger has been increasing since the International Organization for Migration (IOM) started counting in May 2017, when 135 people were dropped, to as high as 2,888 in April 2018.
In all, according to the IOM, a total of 11,276 men, women and children survived the march.
At least another 2,500 were forced on a similar trek into neighbouring Mali, with an unknown number succumbing along the way.
The migrants and refugees AP talked to described being rounded up hundreds at a time, crammed into trucks for hours to what is known as Point Zero, then dropped in the desert and pointed towards Niger. They walk, sometimes at gunpoint.
""There were people who couldn't take it. They sat down and we left them. They were suffering too much,"" said Aliou Kande, an 18-year-old from Senegal.
Kande said nearly a dozen people gave up, collapsing in the sand. His group of 1,000 wandered from 8am until 7pm, he said. He never saw the missing people again.
""They tossed us into the desert, without our telephones, without money,"" he said.
The migrants and refugees' accounts are confirmed by videos collected by the AP over months, which show hundreds of people stumbling away from lines of trucks and buses, spreading wider and wider through the desert.
Two individuals told AP gendarmes fired on them, and multiple videos seen by AP showed armed, uniformed men standing guard.
Liberian Ju Dennis filmed his deportation with a phone he kept hidden on his body. It shows people crammed on the floor of an open truck, vainly trying to shade their bodies from the sun and hide from the gendarmes. He narrated every step of the way in a hushed voice.
""You're facing deportation in Algeria - there is no mercy,"" he said. ""I want to expose them now...We are here, and we saw what they did. And we got proof.""
Algerian authorities have refused to comment. But Algeria has in the past denied criticism that it is committing rights abuses by abandoning migrants and refugees in the desert, calling the allegations a ""malicious campaign"" intended to inflame neighbouring countries.
The Sahara is a swift killer that leaves little evidence behind. The IOM has estimated that for every person known to have died crossing the Mediterranean, as many as two are lost in the desert - potentially upwards of 30,000 people since 2014.
The vast flow of people puts an enormous strain on all the points along the route.
""They come by the thousands. This time, the expulsions that I'm seeing, I've never seen anything like it,"" said Alhoussan Adouwal, an IOM official who has taken up residence in Assamaka to send out the alert when a new group arrives.
He then tries to arrange rescue for those still in the desert. ""It's a catastrophe.""
Most choose to leave by IOM bus for the town of Arlit, about six hours to the south through soft sand. And then on to Agadez, the Nigerien city that has been a crossroads for African trade and migration for generations.
Ultimately, they will return to their home countries on IOM-sponsored flights.
Even as these migrants and refugees move south, they cross paths with some who are making the trip north towards Algeria and Europe.
Every Monday evening, dozens of pickups filled with the hopeful pass through a checkpoint at the edge of the city.
They are fully loaded with water and people gripping sticks, their eyes are firmly fixed on the future.

The bitter rivals met in Khartoum on Monday for a new round of discussions after a meeting last week in Ethiopia ended without a political agreement for South Sudan's ruinous civil war that has killed tens of thousands of people and displaced millions.
""I came to this meeting with an open mind and hope my brother Riek did the same,"" Kiir said at the beginning of the talks, which were mediated by Sudan's President Omar al-Bashir and also attended by Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni.
""I see the need to stop this unnecessary war and hope Dr Riek does as well.""
Kiir said disagreements continued over ""division of power and security arrangements"", in an apparent reference to possible rebel representation in the South Sudanese government and the ""integration"" of rebel and government forces.
For his part, Machar told reporters: ""We came to Khartoum to look for peace"", although he said his own invitation had come ""late"", without elaborating.
""There is a chance for peace and there is a way to achieve peace,"" added Machar.
Sudan's state-run news agency SUNA quoted Museveni as saying that the meeting resulted in ""some points that enable South Sudan's people to enjoy peace"", without offering any further details.
Two years after gaining independence, South Sudan descended into civil war in December 2013 when Kiir accused his then-deputy, Machar, of plotting a coup.
The war has created Africa's largest refugee crisis since the 1994 Rwandan genocide and left millions near famine.
Multiple ceasefires and peace efforts have been unfruitful thus far. A power-sharing peace attempt failed when Machar fled his vice president post, and the country, amid fresh fighting in the capital, Juba, in July 2016.
Last week's face-to-face meeting in Ethiopia's capital, Addis Ababa, was the first for Kiir and Machar in nearly two years.
Following the meeting, South Sudan's government rejected the idea of Machar returning again as Kiir's deputy.
Leaders from the Intergovernmental Authority on Development, an East African regional bloc, also said Machar could leave house arrest in South Africa but was not welcome in any member country except to participate in peace talks.
Kenya is expected to host another round of talks between the rivals in the weeks ahead.
Meanwhile, the United States, the top humanitarian donor to South Sudan, expressed growing impatience with the warring sides, sponsoring a resolution adopted by the UN Security Council early this month that threatens an arms embargo on South Sudan and sanctions against six people, including the country's chief of defence, if fighting does not stop and an agreement is reached.
The new US ambassador to South Sudan told The Associated Press news agency in an interview that Washington is sceptical of the latest peace talks.
""If it's just a repeat of the failed 2015 agreement (that returned Machar to his role as Kiir's deputy) it's not going to work,"" Ambassador Thomas Hushek said.

Three boats belonging to the Spanish coastguard saved 769 people in total on Saturday.
The majority was found between the North African coast and the island of Mallorca, while others were saved on their way to the Canary Islands, west of Africa.

According to the International Organisation for Migration (IOM), Spain has become increasingly popular for refugees to enter Europe over the last couple of months.
In 2017, the organisation registered 3,326 people from entering Spain between January and April. This year, that amount has risen to 4,627, the highest number yet.
This month, many hundreds more have tried to reach Spain, with more than 2,000 arriving last week alone.
The increase comes as Italy's new populist government has made attempts to clamp down on refugees entering the country.
Last week, the country barred the French NGO-run Aquarius ship with more than 600 rescued people on board from docking in Italy, triggering a dispute across the European Union (EU).
Interior Minister Matteo Salvini, also the head of the far-right League party, is making good on an election promise to go after rescue ships run by aid groups, which he has likened to taxi services that help people-smugglers.
On Friday, Italy doubled down on its tough stance against migrants, insisting it could not take ""one more"" refugee and warning the migration crisis could put the EU's survival at stake.
Italy's new stance has led to renewed political tension within the EU.
On Sunday, European leaders will gather in Brussels to discuss the need for changes to its migration policies.
Although the number of refugees arriving in Europe has gone down significantly this year compared to previous, the issue has resulted in a political crisis.
Central and Eastern European countries especially have opposed the European policies of resettling refugees across the continent.
The issue has led to a political crisis in Germany, where Chancellor Angela Merkel has received criticism from her own party for Germany's open stance in the refugee issue.

Sunday's mini-summit was called by European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker who billed it as an ""informal working meeting"" in advance of an important EU summit on migration policy scheduled for June 28 and 29.
The emergency meeting will be an opportunity for German Chancellor Angela Merkel to find possible solutions as she faces a domestic crisis, which is posing an existential threat to her three-months-old coalition government.
Merkel came under pressure last week when her interior minister Horst Seehofer threatened to unilaterally implement an immigration ""master plan"" the chancellor is opposed to.
She believes a measure in the policy to send migrants who have already registered elsewhere in the EU away at the German border goes against Europe's open border agreement.
Last Monday, Seehofer said he would give Merkel until after the EU summit later this week to come up with a European solution.
Merkel on Friday played down the importance of Sunday's meeting, calling it ""no more and no less than a working and consultative meeting"".
She was also pessimistic about the prospects of finding consensus among all EU members.
""We know that no solution will be reached on Thursday and Friday at the level of the 28 member states ... on the overall issue of migration"" she told a press conference during a visit to Beirut, Lebanon.
Instead, the German chancellor expressed hope ""bilateral, trilateral and multilateral"" deals would be reached.
* For all of 2018 if current trends continue

Disagreement over how to reform European migration policy was rife among leaders in the days leading up to the summit.
A main priority is reform of the Dublin regulation that determines that the state through which an asylum seeker enters the EU is the state responsible for their asylum application.
Redistribution of migrants through quotas received fierce opposition from some countries after it was first proposed in 2015.
Italian interior minister Matteo Salvini on Friday reiterated his hard line on immigration.
""We cannot take in one more person,"" he told German magazine Der Spiegel. ""On the contrary; we want to send away a few.""
In recent weeks, Italy's new government has prohibited ships carrying migrants rescued in the Mediterranean from docking in the country's ports.
Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte agreed to attend Sunday's meeting only after Merkel had assured him a draft leaders' statement prepared by the European Commission and circulated on Wednesday would be put aside.
There was tension between Italy and France, too.
On Saturday, Salvini called French President Emmanuel Macron ""arrogant"" and warned that France would not ""transform Italy into Europe's refugee camp"".
The statement came after Macron had said he supported the idea of imposing financial sanctions on EU countries refusing to take in refugees and migrants with proven asylum status.
Speaking alongside Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez, Macron told a press conference ""You can't have countries that massively benefit from the solidarity of the European Union and that massively voice their national selfishness when it comes to migrant issues.""
On Thursday, Macron had said nationalism and anti-migrant sentiments were spreading in Europe like ""leprosy"".
Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz on Saturday said he would reinstate border controls if Seehofer goes ahead with rejecting migrants at the German border.
The 31-year-old leader has been pushing for stronger European borders. He is set to take over the EU presidency, which is rotated every six months, on July 1.
The leaders of the Visegrad group countries, Hungary, Poland, Slovakia and the Czech Republic, announced on Thursday they would be boycotting Sunday's summit altogether.
""We understand there are domestic political difficulties in some countries but that cannot lead to pan-European haste,"" Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban said in an apparent dig at Merkel.
Europe has struggled to formulate a joint migration policy since the 2015 refugee crisis saw the arrival of more than one million people.
But the current crisis comes amid a significant drop in the number of migrants and refugees arriving on Europe's shores.
The United Nations' refugee agency has said it expects about 80,000 people to arrive by sea this year, which is about half the number from 2017.
""We do not have a crisis of numbers. We continue to have a crisis of political will,"" AP news agency quoted UNHCR Europe chief Sophie Magennis as saying.

The leader of the Labour Party made the comments in an interview with Al Jazeera on Saturday during a visit to Jordan marking the UN's World Refugee Day earlier this week.
Jordan is one of the countries most affected by the refugee crisis. It has the second-highest share of refugees compared to its population in the world - 89 per 1,000 inhabitants - according to UNHCR, the UN's refugee agency.
While in Jordan, Corbyn visited two of the biggest refugee camps - al-Zaatari for Syrians and al-Baqa'a for Palestinians.
He spoke to Al Jazeera about the refugee crisis, the US' policies in the Middle East and Britain's departure from the European Union. The interview below has slightly been edited for brevity.
Al Jazeera: What are the main reasons for your visit to Jordan, and why now?
Corbyn: I came for the International Refugee Day on June 20 in order to try to understand the enormity of the refugee numbers in Jordan and the conditions in the camps.
We were yesterday in a camp for Syrian refugees and today we are in the camp for Palestinian refugees. I've used the opportunity to talk to experts in the camps and also to volunteers who are helping them.
We have to recognise that there are 65 million people in the world who are refugees. They all have rights; they all need somewhere to live; they all need to be recognised - and my visit is a part of that process.
Al Jazeera: How do you see the infrastructure and the services in the refugee camps? Do you think the international community should put more effort into developing the situation? And are you satisfied with the British support or do you think the UK can give more?
Corbyn: The camps are as well run as they can be.
I was very impressed with the degree of organisation in the al-Zaatari camp for Syrians and the health facilities there, as well as the solar-powered electricity generation - the equipment was donated by Germany, but the refugees put it in themselves. I think that is brilliant.
But the problem is that there is insufficient funding to pay the staff, there is insufficient funding to develop the infrastructure.
So Britain has been providing quite a lot of money to help Syrian refugees, and I support and welcome that. I think we should give more money to support UNRWA [United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East] at the same time.
Jeremy Corbyn, Labour Party leader
Al Jazeera: How do you think US President Donald Trump's decisions about the Palestinian-Israeli conflict will affect the region? And how do you see Britain position until today?
Corbyn: I think the decision to locate the US embassy in Jerusalem was a huge mistake. And I think the decision to cut the funding from UNRWA is a huge mistake.
I don't know what his ""deal of the century"" involves, but what I do know is the Palestinian people's rights must be met. That means an end to the occupation, the settlement policy and the siege of Gaza, as well as recognising the right to return.
Al Jazeera: How do you think the rise of the right-wing will affect the relationship between Britain and Europe with the Middle East?
Corbyn: I also think there's been a rise in the consciences of many ordinary people who are concerned when they see refugees dying in the Mediterranean and when they see people who are victims of situations not in any sense of their own making.
And I think there's a growth of understanding of human rights and decency and compassion within our society, as well as a need to reduce inequality across the world.
Al Jazeera: Two years after the Brexit vote, how do you think this has re-shaped the relationship between Britain and the European Union? And where is it going?
Corbyn: There is obviously a negotiation going on. My complaint is that the British government is more interested in negotiating with each other in the government rather than negotiating on behalf of Britain.
The Labour position is that we want to reach an agreement with the European Union which means that we keep and recognise the regulations that we have inherited from the European Union on employment consumer and environmental protections.
And that we have a customs and trade access to the European market because many jobs in Britain rely on trade with Europe and likewise across Europe. So I am very concerned that Airbus and some other companies are considering their future in Britain because of the lack of trade with Europe.
There has to be a proper trade agreement with Europe.

The ship - named Lifeline and operated by the German aid group Mission Lifeline - had 234 people on board whom its crew pulled from the Mediterranean.
Matteo Salvini, the Italian interior minister and one of the country\s two deputy prime ministers, had previously indicated that the ship may not dock in Italy and that Malta should take it in.
Italian Transport Minister Danilo Toninelli said on Friday on his Facebook page that Malta had refused to take in the ship, calling the decision ""absurd"" and ""inhumane"".
He also posted a photo of an email from the Maltese Armed Forces saying the ""Lifeline"" was not in an Search and Rescue (SAR) situation. The Maltese email also said the ship ""has not manifested any distress"".
In response, a Maltese government spokesperson told dpa news agency that ""the operation was initially handled by the Rome rescue coordination centre, with the Libyan authority assuming responsibility of the [search-and-rescue] cases. In these cases, Malta was neither the coordinating nor the competent authority.""
Salvini on Thursday said the ship had acted improperly by taking on board migrants that the Italian coastguard had assigned to the Libyan coastguard to rescue. Salvini said the rescue was in Libyan waters, which Lifeline denies.
""We ask humanly and politically that Malta finally opens one of its ports and lets these desperate people disembark"" and then seize the ship, Salvini said.
Maltese Home Affairs Minister Michael Farrugia said on Friday that Salvini ""should get his facts straight"" and that Malta was not involved, as the rescue took place between Libya and Lampedusa.
In a similar incident last week, Salvini barred the French NGO-run Aquarius ship with more than 600 rescued people on board from docking in Italy, triggering a dispute across the European Union.
Malta also refused to allow the rescue ship into its port and after much delay, the Aquarius eventually docked in Valencia, Spain.
Spanish Education Minister Isabel Celaa said in a statement on Friday that Josep Borrell, Spain's minister for foreign affairs, had spoken with authorities in Malta to offer aid for another ship turned away by Italy. Borrell had also spoken to Italian officials, she added.
The latest incident comes as the UN's refugee agency, UNHCR, said on Thursday that 220 people had drowned off the coast of Libya in recent days while attempting to cross the Mediterranean to Europe.
The figure was a ""conservative estimate,"" UN spokesman William Spindler said in Geneva on Friday.
Salvini, also the head of the far-right League party, is making good on an election promise to go after rescue ships run by aid groups, which he has likened to taxi services that help the people-smugglers.
In a video posted to Facebook on Thursday, Salvini criticised Mission Lifeline for not heeding the instructions of Italian or Libyan authorities.
""They risk the lives of the migrants on the dinghy, refuse to listen to Italian and Libyan authorities and intervene so they can load this valuable cargo of humans - of human flesh - on board,"" Salvini said. German rescue organisation Sea-Eye responded to the news on its Twitter feed, writing: ""220 people die within three days and Matteo Salvini is talking about 'human flesh.' Horrific.""
Mission Lifeline said on Friday that it still has not been assigned a port, despite its requests. It said it picked up additional migrant passengers during another rescue overnight, and currently was heading north with 234 on board. It said it had responded to a request for help by a merchant vessel to help rescue 113 people.
""The latest drownings show how important our sea rescue efforts are, and that not a single rescue ship can be missed,"" said Axel Steier, the Mission Lifeline founder.
""The rescue of human lives must be prioritised before border control.""
Italy's three-week-old populist government doubled down Friday on its tough stance against migrants, insisting it could not take ""one more"" refugee and warning the migration crisis could put the bloc's survival at stake. Just two days before a mini summit on the issue in Brussels, it dug its heels in on campaign promises to stop the influx of migrants, threatening to seize rescue ships or barring them from its ports. ""We cannot take in one more person,"" Salvini told the German weekly Der Spiegel. ""On the contrary - we want to send away a few.""
Rome had briefly weighed boycotting Sunday's mini-summit, but finally agreed to attend after reassurances from German Chancellor Angela Merkel. Italy had been riled because a leaked draft statement focused more on the redistribution of the migrants once they had arrived in Europe, rather than on securing Europe's borders.
But the government was placated after Merkel told them the text had been shelved.
More than 640,000 migrants have arrived in Italy since 2014, many of whom made their way northwards to join family or to countries perceived as providing more assistance until Italy's neighbours enacted stricter border controls.
Arrivals are down some 80 percent this year to around 14,500, as people have turned to other routes.
News of rescue ships being turned away from European ports comes as the EU bloc grapples to find a solution to the refugee crisis.
UNHCR chief Filippo Grandi called on the EU on Friday to ""find a new and united approach"" to migration and asylum, saying it was achievable.
Grandi, in a statement issued in the face of an EU summit at the end of next week, said that guarantees were needed so that people in distress at sea are rescued and taken ashore in a predictable way.
Europe is no longer caught in the crux of a large Mediterranean migrant influx, as in 2015, he said.
""Today I am urging European states to seize this opportunity to find a new and united approach that answers the shared needs of all countries to be able to manage their borders and their migration policies, in a way that simultaneously upholds the European and international asylum standards that emerged from the Second World War,"" he said.

The abuse claims against the Shenandoah Valley Juvenile Center near Staunton, Virginia, are detailed in federal court filings that include a half-dozen sworn statements from Latino teens jailed there for months or years. Multiple detainees say the guards stripped them of their clothes and strapped them to chairs with bags placed over their heads.
""Whenever they used to restrain me and put me in the chair, they would handcuff me,"" said a Honduran immigrant who was sent to the facility when he was 15 years old.
""Strapped me down all the way, from your feet all the way to your chest, you couldn't really move ... They have total control over you. They also put a bag over your head. It has little holes; you can see through it. But you feel suffocated with the bag on.""
In addition to the children's first-hand, translated accounts in court filings, a former child-development specialist who worked inside the facility independently told The Associated Press this week that she saw kids there with bruises and broken bones they blamed on guards.
She spoke on condition of anonymity because she was not authorised to publicly discuss the children's cases.
In court filings, lawyers for the detention facility have denied all allegations of physical abuse.
Many of the children were sent there after US immigration authorities accused them of belonging to violent gangs, including MS-13. President Donald Trump has repeatedly cited gang activity as justification for his crackdown on illegal immigration.
Trump said on Wednesday that ""our Border Patrol agents and our ICE agents have done one great job"" cracking down on MS-13 gang members.
""We're throwing them out by the thousands,"" he said.
But a top manager at the Shenandoah Center said during a recent congressional hearing that the children did not appear to be gang members and were suffering from mental health issues resulting from trauma that happened in their home countries - problems the detention facility is ill-equipped to treat.
""The youth were being screened as gang-involved individuals. And then when they came into our care, and they were assessed by our clinical and case management staff ... they weren't necessarily identified as gang-involved individuals,"" said Kelsey Wong, a programme director at the facility.
She testified on April 26 before a Senate subcommittee reviewing the treatment of immigrant children apprehended by the Homeland Security Department.
Most children held in the Shenandoah facility who were the focus of the abuse lawsuit were caught crossing the border illegally alone. They were not the children who have been separated from their families under the Trump administration's recent policy and are now in the government's care. But the facility there operates under the same programme run by the US Office of Refugee Resettlement.
It was not immediately clear whether any separated children have been sent to Shenandoah Valley since the Trump administration in April announced its ""zero tolerance"" policy towards immigrant families, after the lawsuit was filed.
The Shenandoah lockup is one of only three juvenile detention facilities in the United States with federal contracts to provide ""secure placement"" for children who had problems at less-restrictive housing. The Yolo County Juvenile Detention Facility in California has faced litigation over immigrant children mischaracterised as gang members. In Alexandria, Virginia, a board overseeing the Northern Virginia Juvenile Detention Center voted this week to end its contract to house federal immigration detainees, bowing to public pressure.
The Shenandoah detention centre was built by a coalition of seven nearby towns and counties to lock up local kids charged with serious crimes. Since 2007, about half the 58 beds are occupied by both male and female immigrants between the ages of 12 and 17 facing deportation proceedings or awaiting rulings on asylum claims.
Though held in a facility similar to a prison, the children detained on administrative immigration charges have not yet been convicted of any crime.
Virginia ranks among the worst states in the nation for wait times in federal immigration courts, with an average of 806 days before a ruling. Nationally, only about half of juveniles facing deportation are represented by a lawyer, according to Justice Department data.
On average, 92 immigrant children each year cycle through Shenandoah, most of them from Mexico and Central America.
Wong said many of the 30 or so children housed there on any given day have mental health needs that would be better served in a residential treatment unit. But such facilities are often unwilling to accept children with significant behavioral issues, she said.
Wong and other managers at the Shenandoah Center, including Executive Director Timothy J Smith, did not respond to phone and email messages seeking comment this week. A city manager on the local commission that oversees the facility referred questions to an official at the Refugee Resettlement agency, who did not respond to a phone message.
Financial statements reviewed by AP shows the local government commission that operates the centre received nearly $4.2 million in federal funds last year to house the immigrant children - enough to cover about two-thirds of the total operating expenses.
The lawsuit filed against Shenandoah alleges that young Latino immigrants held there ""are subjected to unconstitutional conditions that shock the conscience, including violence by staff, abusive and excessive use of seclusion and restraints, and the denial of necessary mental healthcare.""
The complaint filed by the nonprofit Washington Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights and Urban Affairs recounts the story of an unnamed 17-year-old Mexican citizen apprehended at the southern border.
The teen fled an abusive father and violence fueled by drug cartels to seek asylum in the United States in 2015.
After stops at facilities in Texas and New York, he was transferred to Shenandoah in April 2016 and diagnosed during an initial screening by a psychologist with three mental disorders, including depression. Besides weekly sessions speaking with a counselor, the lawsuit alleges the teen has received no further mental health treatment, such as medications that might help regulate his moods and behavior.
The lawsuit recounts multiple alleged violent incidents between Latino children and staff at the Shenandoah Center. It describes the guards as mostly white, non-Spanish speakers who are undertrained in dealing with individuals with mental illness.
The suit alleges staff members routinely taunt the Latino youths with racially charged epithets, including ""wetback,"" ″onion head"" and ""pendejo,"" which roughly translates to dumbass in Spanish.
A 16-year-old who said he had lived in Texas with his mother since he was an infant ended up at Shenandoah in September after a police officer pulled over a car he was riding in and asked for ID, which he couldn't provide.
As one of the few Latino kids who is fluent in English, the teen would translate for other detainees the taunts and names the staff members were calling them. He said that angered the guards, resulting in his losing such modest privileges as attending art classes.
""If you are behaving bad, resisting the staff when they try to remove you from the programme, they will take everything in your room away - your mattress, blanket, everything,"" he said.
""They will also take your clothes. Then they will leave you locked in there for a while. This has happened to me, and I know it has happened to other kids, too.""
The immigrant detainees said they were largely segregated from the mostly white juveniles being held on criminal charges, but they could see that the other housing units had amenities that included plush chairs and video gaming consoles not available in the Spartan pods housing the Latinos.
In their sworn statements, the teens reported spending the bulk of their days locked alone in their cells, with a few hours set aside for classroom instruction, recreation and meals. Some said they had never been allowed outdoors, while the US-born children were afforded a spacious recreation yard.
The Latino children reported being fed sparse and often cold meals that left them hungry, though meals of American fast food were occasionally provided. Records show Shenandoah receives nearly $82,000 a year from the Agriculture Department to feed the immigration detainees.
The lawsuit said the poor conditions, frequent physical searches and verbal abuse by staff often escalated into confrontations, as the frustrated children acted out. The staff regularly responded ""by physically assaulting the youth, applying an excessive amount of force that goes far beyond what is needed to establish or regain control.""
In the case of the Mexican 17-year-old, the lawsuit said a staff member who suspected him of possessing contraband threw him to the ground and forcibly tore off his clothes for an impromptu strip search. Though no forbidden items were found, the teenager was transferred to ""Alpha Pod,"" described in the lawsuit as a unit within the facility designated for children who engage in bad behavior.
The lawsuit said Latino children were frequently punished by being restrained for hours in chairs, with handcuffs and cloth shackles on their legs. Often, the lawsuit alleged, the children were beaten by staff while bound.
As a result of such ""malicious and sadistic applications of force,"" the immigrant youths have ""sustained significant injuries, both physical and psychological,"" the lawsuit said.
After an altercation during which the lawsuit alleged the Mexican teenager bit a staff member during a beating, he was restrained in handcuffs and shackles for 10 days, resulting in bruises and cuts.
Other teens interviewed as part of the court case also reported being punished for minor infractions with stints in solitary confinement, during which some of the children said they were left nude and shivering in cold concrete cells.
Academic studies of prison inmates kept in solitary confinement have found they often experience high anxiety that can cause panic attacks, paranoia and disordered thinking that may trigger angry outbursts. For those with mental health issues, the effects can be exacerbated, often worsening the very behaviors the staff is attempting to discourage.
A Guatemalan youth sent to the centre when he was fourteen years old said he was often locked in his tiny cell for up to 23 hours a day. After resisting the guards, he said he was also restrained for long periods.
""When they couldn't get one of the kids to calm down, the guards would put us in a chair - a safety chair, I don't know what they call it - but they would just put us in there all day,"" the teen said in a sworn statement. ""This happened to me, and I saw it happen to others, too. It was excessive.""
A 15-year-old from Mexico held at Shenandoah for nine months also recounted being restrained with a bag over his head.
""They handcuffed me and put a white bag of some kind over my head,"" he said, according to his sworn statement. ""They took off all of my clothes and put me into a restraint chair, where they attached my hands and feet to the chair. They also put a strap across my chest. They left me naked and attached to that chair for two and a half days, including at night.""
After being subjected to such treatment, the 17-year-old Mexican youth said he tried to kill himself in August, only to be punished with further isolation. On other occasions, he said, he has responded to feelings of desperation and hopelessness by cutting his wrists with a piece of glass and banging his head against the wall or floor.
""One time I cut myself after I had gotten into a fight with staff,"" the teen recounted. ""I filled the room with blood. This happened on a Friday, but it wasn't until Monday that they gave me a bandage or medicine for the pain.""
The lawsuit alleges other immigrant youths held at Shenandoah have also engaged in cutting and other self-harming behaviours, including ingesting shampoo and attempting to choke themselves.
A hearing in the case is set for July 3 before a federal judge in the Western District of Virginia.
Lawyers on both sides in the lawsuit either did not respond to messages or declined to comment, citing strict confidentiality requirements in the case involving children.
The child development specialist who previously worked with teens at Shenandoah told AP that many there developed severe psychological problems after experiencing abuse from guards.
""The majority of the kids we worked with when we went to visit them were emotionally and verbally abused. I had a kid whose foot was broken by a guard,"" she said. ""They would get put in isolation for months for things like picking up a pencil when a guard had said not to move.
Some of them started hearing voices that were telling them to hurt people or hurt themselves, and I knew when they had gotten to Shenandoah they were not having any violent thoughts.""
She said she never witnessed staff abuse teens first-hand, but that teens would complain to her of injuries from being tackled by guards and reveal bruises. The specialist encouraged them to file a formal complaint.
Though lawyers for Shenandoah responded with court filings denying all wrongdoing, information contained in a separate 2016 lawsuit appears to support some of the information contained in the recent abuse complaints.
In a wrongful termination lawsuit filed against the Shenandoah Center, a former staff member said he worked in unit called ""Alpha Pod"" where immigrant minors were held, ""including those with psychological and mental issues and those who tend to fight more frequently.""
The guard, Trenton Farris, who denied claims that he punched two children, sued the justice centre alleging he was wrongly targeted for firing because he is black. Farris said most staff members at the facility are white, and that two white staff members involved in the incident over which he was fired went unpunished.
Lawyers for the centre denied the former guard's claims, and the case was settled in January.

An opposition statement called Wednesday night's meeting ""cordial"" and said both sides discussed the prospects for peace ""in broad terms"". But it warned that the current model for the peace process is ""unrealistic"" and that ""there is no shortcut to peace"".
""For any meaningful dialogue to take place, it should be within the context of a comprehensive political settlement,"" the group said.
""So that the guns can fall silent and a conducive environment for dialogue established,"" the group said.
It said the solution to the five-year civil war, which has killed tens of thousands of people and forced more than 3 million people to flee their homes, was to revisit the Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA).
The CPA was agreed in 2005 between Sudan and South Sudan that was aimed at ending the civil war in Sudan and paved the way for South Sudan to hold its ultimately successful secession.
South Sudan armed opposition
Kiir and Machar met in neighbouring Ethiopia, whose Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed invited them and presided over discussions.
Images showed the rivals being coaxed by Abiy into an awkward hug as both parties try to negotiate an end to a five-year civil war.
It was not clear whether Kiir and Machar met privately Thursday.
But opposition spokesman Mabior Garang told the AP that a peace deal at the moment was ""not likely"" and that it ""wouldn't be a genuine agreement.""
South Sudan's conflict has continued despite multiple attempts at peace deals.
The East African regional bloc, the Intergovernmental Authority on Development, has led several rounds of failed peace talks.
""Business as usual is over. We will sit and wait as of now,"" Ethiopia's prime minister told the gathering.
Machar fled South Sudan after new fighting erupted in the capital Juba in July 2016, ending a brief attempt at peace in which he returned to his role as Kiir's deputy.
The rebel leader had been held under house arrest in South Africa since late 2016 after fleeing South Sudan.
Weary South Sudanese civilians watching the latest developments called for Kiir, Machar and their supporters to put the country's fate first.
""The people of South Sudan want peace now and (they) need the leaders to sacrifice their personal ambitions for its sake,"" the editor of a local newspaper, Wol Deng Atak, told the AP.
Both sides have been accused of widespread abuses such as gang rapes against civilians, including along ethnic lines.
A number of South Sudan officials have been accused by human rights groups of profiting from the conflict and blocking the path to peace.
Early this month, the UN Security Council adopted a United States-sponsored resolution that threatens an arms embargo on South Sudan and sanctions against six people, including the country's defence chief, if fighting doesn't stop and a political agreement reached.
The civil war has killed tens of thousands of people and created Africa's largest refugee crisis since the 1994 Rwanda genocide, millions of others still in the country are near famine.

He said such meetings of state leaders should be organised by the European Council, the bloc's top decision-making body, not the EU Commission.
The Commission will organise the smaller summit ahead of a full EU summit next week, as an attempt to persuade other EU leaders to further curb immigration and restrict movement of asylum seekers within the European Union and help keep Merkel's ruling coalition from crumbling at home.
Speaking after a meeting in Budapest on Thursday, Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki described Sunday's meeting as ""unacceptable"", adding: ""We are not going to attend, they want to re-heat a proposal that we've already rejected.""
His Hungarian counterpart Viktor Orban said that the meeting was ""against the normal customs of the EU"" and that the appropriate forum was the EU leaders' summit scheduled for next week. The four were joined at the summit by Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz, who has added his voice to calls for a tougher migration policy. ""We have to have a Europe capable of defending us,"" Kurz said after the meeting. ""We have to strengthen (border agency) Frontex, to protect our external border and ensure internal freedom."" The Visegrad states have traditionally taken a hardline stance on migration, rejecting any suggestion of mandatory refugee resettlement among EU members.
All 28 EU member states are unlikely to fulfil at their June 28-29 meeting the demand of Merkel's coalition partner for a bloc-wide plan to spread the burden of hosting asylum seekers more widely among the members.
Merkel hence pushed for an emergency meeting this Sunday with leaders from nine other countries - including the major arrival states Italy and Greece, as well as France, Austria, Bulgaria, the Netherlands and others.
According to agencies, Merkel is hoping a commitment by the states that do attend to do more to limit travel by asylum seekers within the bloc will help placate her coalition partners, the Christian Social Union (CSU).
Immigration figures in Europe are now much lower, with only 41,000 sea arrivals so far this year, according to UN data.
A sea route to Greece used by hundreds of thousands in 2015 was shut in 2016 by an agreement between the EU and Turkey, and use of the other main route across the Mediterranean from Libya to Italy has also tapered off as Libyan factions cracked down on people-smuggling.
But Merkel is still under pressure to obtain more commitments from other states.
Her coalition partner, the CSU from the southern Gerrman state of Bavaria, has said it would bar from Germany all asylum-seekers registered in other EU states, unless a summit of all EU leaders on June 28-29 agrees to a bloc-wide deal to share them out evenly.
Merkel's standoff with the CSU party leader, Germany's Interior Minister Horst Seehofer, has threatened the stability of her government. It has also brought back the issue of migration to the top of the EU's political agenda.

Kiir and Machar met individually with Abiy before the three sat down together, South Sudanese opposition party officials and western diplomats said.
The Kiir and Machar meeting in Addis is the first between the two since a peace deal between the government and Machar's rebel group fell apart in August 2016.
Both leaders continued meeting into the night and were expected to continue discussions on Thursday.

Ethiopia invited them for talks as pressure grows to end a conflict that has killed tens of thousands of people and created Africa's largest refugee crisis since the 1994 Rwanda genocide.
Machar had been held under house arrest in South Africa since late 2016 after fleeing South Sudan.
Tens of thousands of people have been killed in the civil war that broke out in late 2013 when troops loyal to Machar, the former vice president of South Sudan, launched a rebellion against the government.
The United Nations and other organisations have accused all sides in the complex and multifaceted war of committing atrocities against civilians.

Rebel leader Abdul Malik al-Houthi called for reinforcements to repel the advance of the Saudi and UAE-backed government forces, after ongoing fighting left nearly 350 people dead.
""We will face all of the incursions on the ground. Our determination will never be dented,"" he said via the rebels' Al-Masirah news outlet.
Saudi-Emirati coalition forces announced the capture of Hudaida airport on Wednesday morning, a day after breaking through the perimeter fence.
The airport was disused but it housed a major rebel base just inland from the coastal road into the city from the south.
Fresh clashes later erupted between UAE-backed government forces and the Iran-allied rebels on a road linking the airport to Hudaida port on the Red Sea coast, a Yemeni army source said.
Yemeni President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi said military ""operations will continue on various fronts until (the capital) Sanaa and the whole territory"" are retaken from the rebels.
On June 13, Yemen's army and its allies launched their offensive to clear Hudaida of rebel fighters who have held it since 2014, raising UN concerns for vital aid shipments and food imports through the city's docks.
The coalition has long accused Iran of smuggling weapons into Yemen through the seaport - accusations that are rejected by the Houthis and Tehran.
UAE Foreign Minister Anwar Gargash said the ""liberation of Hudaida is the beginning to ending the war.
""The choice in Yemen is between the state and militia, between order and violence, between peace and war,"" he wrote on Twitter, referring to Houthi militiamen.
Three-quarters of Yemen's imports pass through the port, providing a lifeline for some 22 million people in need of aid.
The United Nations has described Yemen as the world's gravest humanitarian crisis and warned any attack on Hudaida port could cripple aid shipments.
The Norwegian Refugee Council said the fighting had already hit water supplies, putting people at high risk of contamination.
Norwegian Refugee Council
Hudaida's residents are bracing for what they fear will be devastating street fighting, as tanks and buses carrying uniformed troops roll through the empty streets of the once-bustling city.
Some 5,200 families fled their homes this month as pro-government forces advanced up the Red Sea coast, according to the UN.
The Hudaida offensive, dubbed Operation Golden Victory, is the most intense battlefront in the already-brutal Yemen war which has left millions displaced.
The war in Yemen, the region's poorest country, started in 2014 after Houthi rebels seized control of the capital and began pushing south towards the country's third-biggest city Aden.
Concerned by the rise of the Houthi rebels, Saudi Arabia and a coalition of Arab states launched a military offensive in 2015 in the form of a massive air campaign aimed at reinstalling the government of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi.
Since then, more than 10,000 people have been killed and at least 40,000 wounded, mostly from Saudi-led air strikes.
In retaliation, the Houthis have launched dozens of missiles at the kingdom.
Saudi authorities say over the past three years 90 ballistic missiles were fired by the rebels.
Multiple rounds of UN-brokered peace talks have all failed to achieve any breakthrough.

As a teenager, Soros, like many other European Jews, worked as a courier for a Jewish council, a body set up by German occupying authorities to ensure the implementation of Nazi orders.
When deportations from Hungary to death camps began to soar during the Holocaust, he was reduced to hiding his Jewish identity to survive.
Today, the 87-year-old billionaire, philanthropist and founder of the Open Society Foundations (OSF) NGO, is the favourite obsession of right-wing and far-right politicians, conspiracy theorists, white supremacists and neo-Nazis across Europe and North America.
From Charlottesville to Budapest, Soros has loomed in the rhetoric of leaders and controversial figures, replete with accusations placing the philanthropist behind everything from Black Lives Matter to migration.
On Wednesday the Hungarian parliament was set to vote over the ""Stop Soros"" bill, proposed legislation linking Soros to the refugee crisis which has gripped Europe since 2015.
In an email to Al Jazeera earlier this month, the Hungarian government's international communications office said: ""The defence of Hungary requires an action plan: this is the 'Stop Soros' legislative package.""
Alex Reid Ross, author of Against the Fascist Creep
Despite widespread condemnation by civil society groups and international watchdogs, the bill is the latest, and perhaps most concerning, realisation of the vast number of conspiracy theories surrounding the Hungarian-American Holocaust survivor.
Soros's long-standing advocacy for liberal democracy and the acceptance of refugees in Europe and beyond is an ongoing source of contention in Hungary and several other countries on the continent.
Alexander Reid Ross, author of Against the Fascist Creep, explained that ""Soros conspiracies have always been a marker for the radical right as opposition to mainstream conservatism"".
Explaining that such theories found currency among some leftists in the past, Ross noted that Soros has been blamed for economic crises, the tanking of currencies worldwide and backing an uprising against Serbia's former ultra-nationalist ruler Slobodan Milosevic, who was toppled in 2001.
The far right's narrative, however, has anti-Semitic undertones.
""In a way, he fits the perfect sort of historic epistemological category in the national socialist tradition,"" Reid Ross told Al Jazeera.
""It used to be Rothschild, but today, Rothschild conspiracy theories are much easier to debunk than they were back then.
""Now you have George Soros filling that space that those conspiracy theories used to occupy.""
While Soros conspiracy theories were once largely confined to the hardline margins, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban has been accused of bringing them to the mainstream political discourse.
During campaigning for the April vote, in which the increasingly far-right Orban was re-elected, the ruling Fidesz party placed an intense focus on Soros.
Accusing him of using his wealth to buy influence in the Central European country, Orban alleged a conspiracy to create ""the Soros type of man"" in February.
The comments followed years of demonisation that largely stemmed from the OSF's advocacy against corruption and for refugees and migrants.
During that campaign, Orban's party plastered Soros's face on billboards that harkened back to World War Two-era anti-Semitic propaganda, as noted by many critics at the time.
Casba Csontos, Open Society Foundations spokesperson
Following years of harassment at the hands of Hungarian politicians, the OSF announced earlier this year that it would leave Hungary for good. The Central European University (CEU), a liberal academic institution funded by Soros, has also announced fears of being forced to quit Hungary and plans to open a campus in neighbouring Austria.
Casba Csontos, an OSF spokesperson, argued that Orban's government elevated Soros conspiracy theories from the once-obscure political fringes to the mainstream.
Describing the allegations against Soros as ""harsh"" and ""very manipulative"", he explained that pro-Orban media outlets have a virtual monopoly on news in many parts of Hungary, particularly in the impoverished countryside.
""Those people can perceive that information as fact, as reality, as real stories of real events happening,"" Csontos told Al Jazeera.
""It's purely a political tactic to distract their attention from pressing problems of average people and corruption,"" he said, adding that the impact was essentially a far-reaching crackdown on civil society which carries consequences for both Hungarians and asylum seekers.
Elsewhere in Europe and beyond, the OSF was evicted from Russia in 2015 and Soros has been vilified by politicians in Poland and across the Balkans.
""The way the Hungarian government is acting against civil society is very similar as the way it is happening in Russia under Vladimir Putin's regime,"" Csontos concluded.
The Hungarian government's office dismissed the allegations, arguing that civil society ""is doing just fine without the Soros-funded groups"".
Despite the incredibly low number of asylum seekers in Hungary, the spokesperson claimed that Soros-backed NGOs tried to turn Europe into ""an immigrant continent"".
The spokesperson added: ""The Soros foundation is fleeing from transparency. They don't want the public to know exactly what they are engaged in and in what way and thanks to that financing they are supporting immigration.""
In the United States, Soros is alleged to be behind the reinvigorated anti-fascist movement (also known as Antifa), the 2008 economic collapse, anarchist demonstrators, Black Lives Matter and a host of left-wing protests.
According to Reid Ross, this rhetoric became prevalent among the far right during the era of the Tea Party, the ultra-conservative movement that sprung up in the wake of Barack Obama's 2008 election.
In 2010, the once popular right-wing Fox News commentator Glenn Beck aired a now infamous series deeming Soros as ""the puppet master"" pulling the strings behind global political developments.
Pushing the conspiracy that Soros was complicit in the Holocaust, Beck said he had bankrolled civil society and liberal organisations as part of a plot to ""form a shadow government, using humanitarian aid as a cover"".
Paradoxically, Beck, who was a vocal supporter of the Tea Party, also painted a complicated and grim picture of Soros as pushing for communism and violent left-wing protests.
The commentator accused Soros of complicity in the Holocaust, Nazi sympathies, pro-Stalin sentiments and funding the ""training"" of anarchists.
""He's waged a war against capitalism,"" Beck, who later left Fox in 2011, scowled in the first segment's closing remarks.
""This is a man who wants the world to be one global society without borders or individual governments. One global society and one global gatekeeper.""
Referring to that period, Reid Ross said: ""It caught speed, like many conspiracy theories, during the Tea Party because that was really a far-right driven anti-federal government, anti-liberal movement.""
He added: ""The conspiracy theories worked their way out from radicalisation of the Tea Party through the Obama administration and into Trump's presidential campaign and then to the opposition to Antifa.""
More recently, with the rise of the alt-right - a loosely knit coalition of white supremacists, white nationalists and neo-Nazis - claims about Soros were given new life.
Alex Jones, the host of the pro-Trump conspiracy website InfoWars, has aimed his ire at Soros on several occasions.
With more than 750,000 average daily views, the online platform has said that Soros has attempted to manufacture a civil war in the US and orchestrated the European refugee influx to undermine the sovereignty of European countries.
Shane Burley, author of Fascism Today
In November 2016, InfoWars broadcast a segment titled Why George Soros Wants to See the World Burn, in which Jones accused Soros of aligning with Democratic Party presidential candidate Hillary Clinton against Donald Trump.
In August 2017, when a far-right protester allegedly killed an anti-racist activist by ploughing his car into a crowd during the ""Unite the Right"" rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, right-wing websites quickly spread a rumour that the assailant was supported by Soros.
Last week, Roseanne Barr, the star of the TV show Roseanne, included Soros in a Twitter outburst that led to ABC Entertainment pulling the plug on her sitcom.
In addition to comparing an African American, Obama-era official to an ape, Barr, who is Jewish, recycled Beck's allegations, accusing Soros of turning in fellow Jews ""to be murdered in German concentration camps"".
Although fact-checking websites such as Snopes have debunked many of these theories time and again, they remain prevalent.
Brooke Binkowski, a reporter at Snopes, described Soros as ""the platonic idea of what anti-Semites think Jews are"", explaining that they are part of an ""artificial push to normalise"" conspiracy theories by recirculating them online in the US and elsewhere.
""The pattern I'm seeing is that someone pushes a [false] story about Soros, then a swarm of bots and paid trolls start picking it up and spreading it [on social media] ... and then it's pushed back into the news cycle,"" she told Al Jazeera.
Shane Burley, author of Fascism Today, argued that Soros conspiracy theories have proven ""durable"" in the face of years of fact-checking and debunking because ""they have a core that has survived for years and years, and that core is anti-Semitism"".
""This conspiracy theory mixes their suspicion of the left and of big banks,"" Burley told Al Jazeera.
""Because he is kind of liberal, George Soros touches on both [for the far right].""
Explaining that ""their narrative"" positions ""the left as part of the establishment"", Burley concluded: ""They need anything right now that says that resistance to them is organic and isn't part of the establishment.""

The package of legislation called the 'Stop Soros' bill, which targets rights groups and NGOs, criminalises the act of assisting migrants, allowing for the incarceration of individuals, or the banning of organisations. In addition to the bill, the parliament also passed a constitutional amendment stating that an ""alien population"" cannot be settled in Hungary.
Following the passing of the laws on what also happens to be World Refugee Day, rights groups and international organisations decried the measures as draconian and a violation of fundamental human rights.
""Criminalising essential and legitimate human rights work is a brazen attack on people seeking safe haven from persecution and those who carry out admirable work to help them. It is a new low point in an intensifying crackdown on civil society and it is something we will resist every step of the way,"" Amnesty International's Europe director Gauri van Gulik said in a statement.
Having swept the April general elections, Prime Minister Viktor Orban's Fidesz party holds a supermajority in parliament, assuring a smooth passage of the law. Wednesday's vote of the 'Stop Soros' law saw 160 lawmakers vote in favour, with just 18 voting against.
""Can there be compromise in the migrant debate? No – and there is no need for it,"" Orban said during a conference in Budapest over the weekend.
""We tolerate the fact that some [EU] member states…admit migrants. This has and will have consequences – including for us. Meanwhile, they should tolerate the fact that we do not wish to do so.""
The Council of Europe and the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), two of Europe's leading rights bodies, have criticised the new law for being arbitrary and vague.
The Venice Commission of the Council of Europe had previously appealed to the Hungarian government to wait until Friday when it was expected to issue its opinion of the bill.
""The bill is unconstitutional and ignores EU values and principles,"" said Petra Bard, an expert on EU constitutional law and EU criminal justice and visiting professor of the Central European University (CEU), which was founded by democracy advocate and philanthropist George Soros, whom the bill is named after.
""The bill is very poorly drafting and there is no definition of who is an illegal immigrant. My suspicion is that part of the reason it is that so it can remain ambiguous,"" she said.
On Tuesday, the finance ministry also introduced a proposed 25 percent tax to be paid by NGOs that assist immigrants, a provision that was previously on the 'Stop Soros' bill but then later stripped.
""We need to introduce additional measures to protect Hungary from illegal migration,” according to a statement issued by the ministry on Tuesday.
""The defense against illegal migration imposes a heavy burden on Hungary’s budget, so it indirectly affects the Hungarian people,"" according to the statement.
""Therefore, the government proposes that as a manner of burden sharing, the organisations aiding migration should bear additional taxes.""
Orban's war on civil society actors and Soros in particular was well publicised during his campaign run ahead of the elections earlier this year. His Open Society Foundations was already forced out of Hungary last month amid increasing political pressure and a challenging legal environment, while the fate of CEU still hangs in the balance.
""Some of the departments will certainly have to move out but we still don't know which ones,"" said Bard, adding that it is possible the entire university may have to relocate to Vienna.
For the NGOs now affected by Hungary's new laws, some have already said they would stay and fight them for as long as possible.
""We will continue to advocate for the European Commission as well as individual EU governments to step up their criticism on this, to work together somehow, and to prevent the impact of this law,"" said Todor Gardos, an Eastern Europe and Balkans researcher at Human Rights Watch.
""All the EU experts say the measure that he government has been pushing through over the last three years fundamentally violates the rights of the migrants and there should be a big action to against the government for breeching those rights.""

In its annual report released on Tuesday, UNHCR said continued crises in places like South Sudan and the Democratic Republic of Congo, as well as the exodus of Rohingya from Myanmar that started last year, raised the overall figure of forced displacement in 2017 to 68.5 million.
At least 53 percent of the total displaced are children, including many who are unaccompanied, according to the Global Trends report.
Of that the 68.5 million total, 16.2 million were displaced last year - an average of more than 44,000 people a day, it said.
""This is a global phenomenon that requires international solidarity and cooperation on a global scale,"" Filippo Grandi, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, told Al Jazeera from the Libyan capital, Tripoli.
""And this is what the rising figures tell the world.
""Refugees are fleeing violence, war and persecution. We have an obligation to help them,"" Grandi said.
Earlier, Grandi called for a ""new and far more comprehensive approach"" to deal with the refugee situation.
UNHCR said the figures debunk a flawed perception that a refugee crisis has affected more developed countries in the ""Global North"".
According to the UNHCR, four out of five refugees lived in countries bordering the homes they fled.
Grandi said that these neighbouring countries - such as Turkey, Pakistan and Uganda - which host the majority of refugees need to be helped.
""Let’s not forget that of the 68.5 million refugees and displaced, 85 percent of them are not in rich countries,"" he said.
Some 25.4 million refugees fled their countries to escape conflict and persecution, according to the report.
The UNHCR chief expressed his concerns at the response of Western countries in dealing with the refugee situation.
""And they are not even effective, if you close avenues on one side they open on another,"" he said.
""We need to look at root causes and we need to address the reasons why these people leave violence and war.""

The far-right politician, who is also one of the country's two deputy prime ministers, defended his position on Tuesday, a day after stirring controversy by saying on TV that he had commissioned ""a dossier on the Roma situation in Italy"" to see how many there are in the country.
He evoked the idea of expelling many of them, adding that ""unfortunately we have to keep Italian Roma people in Italy because you can't expel them"".
Salvini, who caused uproar last month when he barred an NGO-operated rescue ship from landing hundreds of mostly African refugees and migrants in Italy, ran into similar protests for his latest remarks.
Opposition MPs condemned the idea of a census as ""racist"" and ""fascist"", while members of the newly-established ruling coalition also criticised his comments.
The opposition centre-left Democratic Party's leader Matteo Orfini tweeted: ""If we really want to carry out the census, I would start with the census of racists and fascists. To better avoid them.""
Luigi Di Maio, fellow deputy prime minister and leader of the anti-establishment Five Star Movement that makes up the coalition alongside Salvini's far-right League party, said any census based on ethnicity would be ""unconstitutional"".
A Roma Nation Association statement noted that the authorities had carried out a count of the community last year and called for a meeting with Salvini at the earliest opportunity.
The European Union also weighed in on the controversy. EU Commission spokesman Alexander Winterstein told journalists that ""as a general rule, we cannot deport a European citizen based on ethnic criteria"".
Italy's Jewish community said the idea of a census drew parallels with measures targeting Jews under fascist war-time leader Benito Mussolini.
The ""announcement is worrying and evokes memories from just 80 years ago which are sadly increasingly forgotten"", said community leader, Noemi Di Segni.
Despite the criticism, Salvini stuck to his guns on Tuesday. ""I'm not giving up and I'm pushing ahead! The Italians and their safety first,"" he wrote on social media.
But confronted with widespread anger, Salvini's League party said in a separate statement ""it is not our intention to record or take anyone's fingerprints.
It added: ""Our goal is a recognition of the situation of Roma camps. We intend to protect thousands of children who are not allowed to attend school regularly.""
Salvini has repeatedly taken aim at the Roma community, making promises to bulldoze Roma camps during his election campaign.
According to a report by Association 21 Luglio, which works with the Roma community, there are between 120,000 and 180,000 Roma living across Italy.
Here's a round-up of social media reaction to Salvini's comments:
Translation: ""Refugees yesterday, Roma today, tomorrow guns for all. How exhausting it is being bad,"" Paolo Gentiloni, a centre-left Italian politician and former politician wrote.
Ieri i rifugiati, oggi i Rom, domani le pistole per tutti. Quanto è faticoso essere cattivo
Rachele Salvatelli, a PhD researcher, said:
Something scary is happening in Italy right now. Interior minster #Salvini is calling for a Roma census. Making a census on people's ethnicity. Where is that I've heard this before? OH. RIGHT. #Salvinischedacitutti
Ana Gomes, Socialist Member of the European Parliament, wrote:
Fascist, racist #Salvini! And after the migrants and the #Roma, who’ll they come to get next?... WAKE UP, #ITALY! #EU! https://t.co/4uJPEPHAzy
Kathleen Van Brempt, a member of the European Parliament, tweeted:
First they came for the #refugees. And I did not speak out, because I was not a refugee. Then they came for the #Roma. And I did not speak out, because I was not a Roma. Then they came for the rest of us. And there was no one left to speak for us. #Salvini
Author and activist Harry Leslie Smith said this is ""how it all started in 1930s Germany"", referring to the time when the Nazis reached power:
And this folks is how it all started in 1930s Germany. To be quite honest if the EU doesn't stop this it will show the institution is beginning to rot like a corpse in the sun. #roma https://t.co/2g94AXiXpe

Seehofer on Monday agreed to implement his immigration ""master plan"" step by step, stopping short of unilaterally enforcing a policy opposed by Merkel while she attempts to find a solution at European level.
Merkel has been in disagreement with the leader of her Bavarian allies, the Christian Social Union (CSU), over a point in Seehofer's plan that would see Germany turn away all migrants who have already registered elsewhere in the EU.
That proposal would see Europe's south bear the brunt of the inflow of migrants and refugees.
Both Merkel's Christian Democratic Union (CDU) party and her Bavarian allies, the Christian Social Union (CSU) held meetings on Monday to discuss the next steps in the disagreement.
At a press conference afterwards, Merkel said she would hold talks at an upcoming EU summit and report back to her party by July 1.
The chancellor emphasised she does not want to see Germany unilaterally turn back migrants at the country's borders.
Seehofer on Monday said he'd be glad to see a European agreement but that ""we want this national solution unless a European solution comes together"".
""We wish the chancellor much luck,"" he told a press conference.
Over the weekend, Seehofer had signalled he would hold off on implementing the measure until after an EU summit on migration and asylum policy that is scheduled for the end of the month.
On Monday, German news agency DPA reported Germany would implement the plan step by step, starting with the rejection of migrants who have already been deported or have an entry ban.
If Merkel fails to make deals with her European counterparts, Seehofer could still go ahead with instructing police to turn away all migrants who have registered elsewhere in the EU.
Doing that unilaterally and with Merkel's explicit opposition could lead to the collapse of the German government, which was sworn in only three months ago.
On Monday, Merkel will host the new Italian prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, who is heading a government with an anti-immigration agenda.

""Papa! Papa!"" one child weeps as screams and cries of others are heard in an audio clip released by ProPublica, a US-based media outlet, on Monday.
""Well, we have an orchestra here, right?"" a Border Patrol agent is heard saying in the clip. ""What's missing is a conductor.""
According to ProPublica, the clip was obtained from prominent civil rights lawyer Jennifer Harbury who was given the audio by an unidentified individual who recorded the children in a detention centre.
The now-viral clip has driven anger that continues to mount against US President Donald Trump, whose administration has introduced a ""zero-tolerance"" approach towards migrants and refugees who cross the US southern border without documents.
Part of the policy has been separating children from their parents who are detained.
Inside a detention center last week. Children separated from their parents wail and ask for help. A Border Patrol agent booms above the crying. ""Well, we have an orchestra here,"" he jokes. ""What's missing is a conductor."" Listen to the full audio here: https://t.co/FrqfILMSUP pic.twitter.com/3Htj4t7alB
Last week, a Department of Homeland Security (DHS) spokesman said that nearly 2,000 minors were separated from 1,940 adults who crossed the US border without documents between April 19 and May 31.
Administration officials say they are simply following the law, however, there are no statutes that mandate separating children from families at the border.
On Monday, DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen faced a number of questions from White House reporters over the practice. She again blamed the policy on politicians, saying that ""Congress alone can fix it.""
However, critics point out that the administration can simply end the ""zero-tolerance"" approach. Rights groups accuse Trump of using the issue as a way to pressure Democrats into pushing through immigration reform legislation that includes funding for his border wall on the US-Mexico border.
House minority leader Nancy Pelosi, as well as Democratic Senators Kamala Harris and Tina Smith have called on Nielsen to resign.
Nielsen told reporters on Monday that she had not listened to the nearly eight-minute audio clip obtained by ProPublica.
In the clip, a six-year-old girl can be heard asking for her aunt, saying the phone number she had memorised.
The aunt told ProPublica that her sister and niece left for the US from El Salvador more than a month ago. When she spoke to the young girl, she said she pleaded with her to come and pick her up.
Aunt of six-year-old speaking to ProPublica
""It was the hardest moment in my life,"" the aunt told ProPublica. ""Imagine getting a call from your six-year-old niece. She's crying and begging me to go get her. She says, 'I promise I'll behave, but please get me out of here. I'm all alone.'""
Prior to the audio clip going viral, Trump said that he would not allow the US to become a ""migrant camp"", adding that ""it will not be a refugee holding facility. It won't be.""
Trump's comments came as many legislators on both sides of the aisle, as well as rights groups, intensified their criticism, with Amnesty International calling his policy ""nothing short of torture"".
""Make no mistake, these family separations are a crisis of the government's own making,"" Erika Guevara-Rosas, Amnesty's Americas director, said in a statement on Monday.
""This is a particularly cruel policy, where frightened children are being ripped from their parent's arms and taken to overflowing detention centres, which are effectively cages,"" she said.
""This is nothing short of torture.""
The ""cages"" Guevara-Rosas was referring to are the so-called ""shelters"" and ""detention centres"" where individuals, including children, are being housed.
DHS released photos of the centres after a small group of reporters and politicians went on a tour of a facility in Texas over the weekend. The photos show individuals, including children, sitting on mattresses on the floor in chain-link fences.
Over the weekend, protesters also marched to the newly erected tent city in Tornillo, Texas, where hundreds of boys will be housed, according to Congressman Will Hurd, who toured the area.
In February, Human Rights Watch (HRW) released a report that found that women and children detained by US Customs and Border Protection were regularly held in freezing cells and suffer other harsh treatment.
The report was based on interviews of about 110 women and children who were held in centres in 2015, 2016 and 2017 - under the administrations of both Trump and former President Barack Obama. The majority of the interviews were conducted in 2017.
Obama was also criticised after photos in 2014, showed children in similar holding cells, also referred to by rights groups as ""cages"".
At the time, Obama officials said the facilities were necessary to deal with an influx in the number of ""unaccompanied minors"" coming to the US.
The photos outraged the public, as well as immigrants rights groups, many of whom were also staunch critics of the former president's tough immigration policies.
According to a study by the racial justice think-tank Applied Research Center (now known as Race Forward), more than 5,100 children in 22 states in 2011 were in foster care due to deportations.
Local news reports at the time documented stories of children and teens coming home to find a parent detained and eventually deported.
Unlike Trump, however, previous administrations, including that of Obama, did not have a policy of separating nearly all families at the border.
Erika Guevara-Rosas, Amnesty International
Trump's ""zero-tolerance"" policy is a departure from the previous precedent that placed those detained in immigration proceedings while their asylum claims were examined or deportation proceedings finalised.
Families were often kept together in centres, or released to await their hearings.
Trump has repeatedly rallied against immigrants since the 2016 presidential election, running on a campaign to build a wall on the US -Mexico border.
He expanded the powers of the Immigration Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency to focus on detaining the majority of undocumented immigrants, including those with no criminal record.
The administration has also ended Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for thousands of Salvadorans, Haitians, Nepalis, Nicaraguans and Sudanese.
Trump also attempted to end protections for children brought to the US without documents. That decision has been temporarily blocked by the courts.

Wednesday's meeting in Ethiopia's capital, Addis Ababa, comes amid efforts to end the world's youngest country's five-year civil war, which has killed tens of thousands of people and caused about four million to flee their homes.
The warring leaders will meet at the invitation of Ethiopia's Prime Minister Ahmed Abiy.
Ateny Wek Ateny, South Sudan's government spokesman, called Abiy's invitation ""significant"", telling The Associated Press news agency: ""anything that brings peace in South Sudan is wanted.""
The meeting was initially scheduled for Tuesday but postponed by one day at the last minute. It will be mediated by the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD), an East African regional bloc that has led several rounds of failed peace talks.
Having split from Sudan in 2011, South Sudan descended into civil war in 2013 after Kiir accused Machar, then his deputy, of plotting a coup.
Since then, multiple ceasefire agreements and peace efforts have failed to yield any positive results.
Machar fled South Sudan in July 2016 after new fighting erupted in the capital, Juba, ending a brief attempt at peace in which he returned to his role as Kiir's vice president.
The rivals have not met since.
Pressure has been growing on the warring sides to end a conflict that has created Africa's largest refugee crisis since the 1994 Rwanda genocide.
Both sides have been accused of abuses against civilians, including along ethnic lines.
Earlier this month, the UN Security Council adopted a US-sponsored resolution that threatens an arms embargo on South Sudan and sanctions against six individuals, including the country's defence chief, if fighting does not stop and a political agreement reached.
The resolution asks UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres to report to the Council on that by June 30.

""Residents aren't satisfied with today's situation. They are demanding from authorities a higher number of special police - not traffic police who have been dealing with this - and they're worried that these situations could happen again and could turn into something else.""
The International Red Cross says the number of people migrating through the Balkans is on the rise and that they are in dire need of basic humanitarian support.
Authorities in Bosnia have struggled with the influx of thousands of people from the Middle East, Africa and Asia as many head there to avoid more heavily guarded routes through the Balkans in their bid to reach the EU.
Peter Van der Auweraert, from the International Organization for Migration, tweeted that the attempted group crossing on Monday was a ""very worrying development"" that risked creating a backlash.
Van der Auweraert explained in a phone interview with The Associated Press that the migrant influx has already put pressure on post-war Bosnia and that any incidents could further strain the situation. Bosnians might start viewing migrants as ""troublemakers"" rather than people in need of help, he said.

The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies said on Monday that more than 5,600 migrants have reached Bosnia and Herzegovina so far this year, compared with only 754 in all of 2017.
The Red Cross also said that in Montenegro, 557 asylum requests were registered in May, the highest monthly figure in five years.
Simon Missiri, regional director for Europe, said his group's Balkan offices need more assistance to help cope with the increased numbers.
Hundreds of thousands of people passed through the Balkans towards Europe at the peak of the mass migration in 2015. The flow eased for a while but has recently picked up pace with the new route through Bosnia.
Since peaking in 2015, the migrants' use of the Balkan route towards Western Europe has been impaired in part by Hungary's construction of razor-wire fences on its southern borders.

The first batch of migrants made their way slowly down the gangplank of the Italian coastguard ship Datillo in the port of Valencia early on Sunday, more than a week after they were rescued in several operations off the coast of Libya.
The MV Aquarius charity rescue docked around two hours after the Datillo and the Orione, another coast guard ship, shortly after.
It marked the close of an exhausting 1,300km ordeal that began when the MV Aquarius charity rescue boat was barred from entering ports in Italy and Malta, leaving the 630 on board, including 100 children and seven pregnant women, stranded at sea.
The refugees arrived in three stages because the two Italian ships had taken on board 400 people from the overburdened rescue boat.
Since newly appointed Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez offered a safe harbour to the migrants on Monday, Valencia has rapidly deployed its emergency plans to cater for the refugees.
""Everyone is exhausted and the team is completely stressed,"" said Til Rummenhohl, Vice President of SOS Mediterranee, which operates the Aquarius alongside Doctors Without Borders (MSF).
""They have been working 24/7 for a week and [the migrants] are confused. They've already passed close to land so many times - at Sardinia and Majorca - and they are wondering why they were still not on land ... the mood is not that nice.""
Aloys Vimard, an MSF coordinator who was on board, said that the Aquarius is not a ""cruise ship"". The boat is not made accommodate people for more than four days, he said, recalling the image of a woman breastfeeding while seasick.
More than 2,300 people have rallied together to help the exhausted arrivals, including 1,000 Red Cross volunteers, 400 translators and around 450 national police and civil guards.
""Welcome home"" read a large banner unfurled at the harbour, translated into five languages for the migrants, who hail from more than 20 countries.
The majority are from sub-Saharan Africa and it is unclear how many will qualify for refugee status, as many are from countries which do not have high asylum approval rates within the European Union (EU).
Those onboard will receive immediate medical attention and psychological assistance from the Red Cross, after which they will be registered by Spanish authorities and transferred to reception centres.
Of the 130 people examined so far, health officials said there were no serious illnesses, but a significant number had suffered mild conditions caused by overcrowding and high temperatures.
Valencia's authorities have promised that each individual will retain the same translator throughout the registration process, which may last several weeks.
France will also accept a number of the migrants, Spain's deputy prime minister Carmen Calvo said on Saturday.
""France will accept migrants who express the wish to go there,"" said Calvo.
Mathilde Auvillain of SOS Mediteranee, who has volunteered on previous rescue missions aboard the Aquarius, criticised the ""shameful dispute"" between European leaders this week.
""What these people need is safety,"" Auvillain added. ""They need protection and what are we talking about? Delaying protection? What's the point.""
Italy's far-right interior minister Matteo Salvini, who banned the Aquarius from entry to Italian ports, sparking a diplomatic row with France, has pledged to reject two further Dutch NGO rescue boats who are beginning rescue operations off the coast of Libya.
""Two other ships with the flag of Netherlands, Lifeline and Seefuchs, have arrived off the coast of Libya, waiting for their load of human beings abandoned by the smugglers,"" Matteo Salvini, wrote on his Facebook page.
""These gentlemen know that Italy no longer wants to be complicit in the business of illegal immigration, and therefore will have to look for other ports [not Italian] where to go.""
Spain's maritine rescue service said it saved 933 people in the Mediterranean on Friday and Saturday. It also recovered four bodies.

Citing witness statements, Oxfam accused French police of repeatedly withholding food, water and blankets from underage refugees who crossed the border into France from the Italian town of Ventimiglia, where some 16,500 refugees currently live.
""French police officers are not upholding international standards,"" Oxfam's Chiara Romagno said in a statement. ""They taunt children and mistreat them. Some children have had the soles of their shoes cut off before being sent back to Italy,"" she added.
The report said children complained about being ""physically and verbally abused, and detained overnight in cells without food, water or blankets and with no access to an official guardian,"" all contrary to French and EU law.
""In one case, a very young Eritrean girl was forced to walk back across the border along a road with no pavement carrying her 40-day-old baby,"" the report said.
According to European law, unaccompanied children requesting asylum cannot be sent back to where they came from.
Most of the refugees were fleeing persecution and war in countries such as Sudan, Eritrea, Syria and Afghanistan.
""The French authorities do not recognise any of them as asylum seekers and push them back to Italy immediately after crossing, even though they are required by law to assess the situation of each child,"" the report, which is based on dozens of testimonies, says.
""Moreover, there are no interpreters or lawyers present at the border.""
According to French law, children who are not considered asylum seekers in France should have a legal guardian assigned to them and be given at least 24 hours before being sent back.
Based on the testimonies, Oxfam said French police do not follow these laws.
The report also accused the police of sometimes filling in documents for the refugee children.
""In the field 'vos droits' ('your rights') they often write 'I want to leave as soon as possible', as if being immediately pushed back is the child's choice - which in almost all cases, it isn't,"" the report found.
""Policemen yell at them, laugh at them, push them and tell them 'you will never cross here'. Some children have their mobile phones seized and the SIM card removed,"" it also said.
""They cannot even call their parents.""
The report said Roja Camp, the official camp set up outside Ventimiglia, was vastly overstretched and that the ""heavy police presence at the entrance and compulsory fingerprinting deter many from staying"" there. Most refugees and migrants preferred to live rough, sleeping under a motorway outside town with no sanitation facilities or clean water. ""In Ventimiglia, there are no arrangements to take care of the returned children. Once off the train, they are left to fend for themselves,"" the report said. Oxfam said France should immediately stop and punish the ""illegal practices of the French police at the French-Italian border"", ensure the right to seek asylum for all foreign children in French territory and take care of them according to the provisions of national, European and other international laws. An EU scheme to distribute migrants and refugees equitably among the bloc's members has failed miserably, with central European members flatly refusing the quotas and others, including France, falling far short of their allocated target. Italy has received more than 700,000 migrants and refugees since 2013. Many West Africans try to continue on to France, where they speak the language and often have relatives, only to find the border shut to them. Thousands of those who manage to cross the Alps into France have been detained and sent back to Italy.

According to human rights organisation Refugee Action Coalition, the man's body was found on Saturday morning inside his family tent in the RCP3 detention centre.
He is the twelfth person to die in Australian offshore detention and the fifth asylum seeker to die on Nauru.
#BREAKING We’re devastated beyond words to be receiving reports a young man has died on #Nauru having completed suicide. We ask that his identity be kept confidential until such time as his families wishes can be ascertained. Please respect their privacy at this tragic time.
Apart from the man's wife, his severely ill mother and a 12-year-old brother are also being held on Nauru.
Based on a medical report by Australia's International Health and Medical Services, the man suffered from severe depression after being held in detention in Iran when he was 10 years old.
The death once again highlights the dire conditions refugees endure when dealing with Australia's strict immigration policies.
Under those policies, asylum seekers attempting to reach the country by boat are intercepted and sent to one of two offshore detention centres.
The camp in Nauru is home to women, children and families, while the other one, on the Papua New Guinean island of Manus, houses single men.
In total, about 1,600 people are currently being held in the two camps.
""There are 100s of people in urgent need of medical care to address complex conditions including major depression and suicidal ideation, who are being denied care under the Minister,"" Natascha Bucher, detention advocacy manager for the NGO Asylum Seeker Resource Center, said in a statement.
The death comes two weeks after a Rohingya refugee committed suicide on Manus.
Behrooz Boochani, an Iranian refugee and journalist held captive on Manus, said on Twitter the Australian authorities were responsible for the death, despite Australia referring the case to the Nauru authorities.
More blood on the hands of Peter Dutton. These deaths can not be ignored. Australia wake up! Stand against these murderers. 12 people killed by this system so far and there will be more soon if it’s not stopped immediately!#Manus
Department of Home Affairs has referred the case to Nauruan authorities as always. It’s Australia that is responsible for his death not Nauru! You are the one who exiled people there and denied them medical treatment and support. Dutton must give an answer to people!#Nauru
In 2016, an Iranian man was fined $155 for attempted suicide, a criminal offence in Nauru.
The man, the sole guardian of his eight-year-old daughter in the detention centre, pleaded guilty to the offence of attempted suicide, according to a Nauru government statement.
The Nauru government said prosecutors wanted to ""deter other would-be offenders who resort to self-harm to avoid lawful actions against them or to get what they want"".

French President Emmanuel Macron and Italy's new populist Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte met in Paris on Friday in a bid to bury the hatchet after a bitter diplomatic squabble erupted this week over Rome's refusal to accept the Aquarius, a refugee and migrant rescue ship, at its ports.
""We should create European centres in the countries of departure,"" Conte told a press conference, referring to African nations that have seen an exodus towards Europe in recent years.
His comments were echoed by Macron, who told reporters he supported the idea of ""branches of our asylum agencies to tackle this question on the other side"" of the Mediterranean.
The two leaders also called for changes to the European Union's asylum rules, which put the migrant burden on their port of entry to Europe - mainly Italy and Greece.
Conte singled out the Dublin regulations, under which the EU country where an asylum seeker first arrives must deal with their application, as needing change.
""The very concept of a state of first entry needs to be rethought,"" he argued. ""Whoever sets foot in Italy sets foot in Europe.""
""We are drafting our own proposal,"" said Conte, adding that it will be presented during the Austrian presidency of the European Council beginning next month.
Macron urged greater solidarity with Rome over the migrant crisis, calling for ""profound reforms"" of the Dublin regulation.
There have been few signs that European leaders are ready to coordinate their policies despite a looming end-of-June deadline to change the EU's current asylum rules.
In Germany, Europe's biggest economy, Chancellor Angela Merkel is embroiled in a showdown with the right wing of her governing coalition, which is demanding that she immediately ditch her liberal migration policy and tighten border controls.
On Wednesday, Germany's Interior Minister Horst Seehofer said Austria and Italy should ally themselves with Germany to work at the interior minister level on security and immigration.
""Merkel is very much against starting to send people back ... but it's clear her interior minister ... wants to do that,"" Al Jazeera's Nadim Baba, reporting from Paris, said.
""She [could] be forced into a situation where she would have to sack him; [if so] her government would collapse and probably she would no longer be chancellor, so she is desperately trying to come to some sort of agreement which involves other countries,"" he added.
In Paris, both Macron and Conte slapped down an ""axis of the willing"" proposed this week by hardliners such as Conte's own interior minister, Matteo Salvini, and Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz, who says he also has the support Seehofer. ""I would want an axis of the willing comprising all European countries,"" Conte said. Macron said that any decisions on joint migration policy involving France, Germany and Italy would be taken by their respective presidents and prime ministers. Terms such as ""axis"" ""have never brought us anything good in the past,"" Macron remarked, before suggesting that Salvini's links with fellow migration hardliners might be put to better use persuading them to help Italy deal with its arrivals. ""So, if Austria, Hungary and some others, thanks to these special contacts, can provide more of the solidarity that Italy needs, it's very good news for Italy and for everyone,"" Macron said.
Speaking alongside Macron in Paris, Conte said the two had ""fully clarified"" their views and were in ""perfect agreement"".
The spat between France and Italy erupted this week after Macron accused Rome of ""cynicism and irresponsibility"" for refusing to let the Aquarius dock.
Italy's new government hit back, accusing Paris of giving ""hypocritical lessons"" and threatening to pull out of the meeting with Macron.
Rome also summoned the French ambassador over the dispute - the second time it has done so over the migrant crisis in two months.
Macron, who has taken a tough line on migration from African countries that are not at war, said that ""none of his comments were intended to offend Italy or the Italian people.""
In a further gesture of reconciliation, the French foreign ministry said it was ready to welcome migrants on board Aquarius who ""meet the criteria for asylum"" after they arrive in Spain.

Matteo Salvini, Italy's new far-right, anti-immigration interior minister, sparked a European diplomatic fallout when he refused to allow the MV Aquarius rescue boat to dock, tweeting on Sunday: ""From today, Italy will also start to say no to human trafficking, no to the business of illegal immigration"", along with the hashtag #chiudiamoiporti (close the doors).
After Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez, a socialist who took office on June 2, offered to take the refugees in, they began the four-day journey to Valencia on Tuesday evening.
""The Mediterranean Sea must not become a mass grave"" because it has always been ""a bridge between cultures, nations, people from different races and languages, a bridge towards progress, commerce, contact, experiences and relationships"", Monica Oltra, Valencia's regional vice president, said on Friday.
The refugees will arrive in three boats, as two Italian naval and coastguard vessels took on board 400 people from the overburdened rescue boat.
Maltese and Italian navy ships had resupplied the Aquarius with bottles of water, food packages and clothing for the 1,300km voyage.
Before their four-day journey, the refugees and migrants - who had set off from Libya - had remained stranded between Sicily and Malta for more than 36 hours.
""Italy's decision to close its ports to these people is a disgrace and puts their lives at risk unnecessarily,"" said David Beversluis, a doctor on board the Aquarius. ""These people are vulnerable and they need medical attention.""
Monica Oltra, Valencia's regional vice president
Aquarius is run by SOS Mediterranee and Doctors Without Borders (MSF), who announced the expected landing day.
Italy's denial of a safe harbour has led to an international outcry.
European politicians and NGOs rebuked Italy for what they claimed was a violation of its humanitarian responsibilities and international maritime law, which requires the nearest port to admit ships in distress.
French President Emmanuel Macron launched a war of words, calling Italy ""irresponsible"", while his party's spokesman Gabriel Attal told Public Senat TV: ""The Italian position makes me vomit.""
Italy's foreign ministry then summoned the French ambassador to Rome to explain Macron's comments.
Salvini struck back at France, calling on Macron to honour a 2015 deal to accept almost 10,000 migrants under an EU distribution scheme.
""I ask President Macron to pass from words to action,"" he said in a speech to parliament on Wednesday.
There were suggestions that a scheduled meeting between Italy's Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte and Macron would not go ahead in Paris on Friday, but that meeting is now taking place.
While upsetting France, Salvini found allies in Germany's Interior Minister Horst Seehofer and far-right Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz, who suggested Italy, Germany and Austria form an ""axis of the willing"" to tackle illegal migration.
Authorities are preparing a sailing facility near Valencia port to accommodate those on board for up to several days.
Doctors on board warned of overcrowding and said several people needed immediate medical treatment for serious illnesses, including hypothermia and chemical burns.
The Red Cross and local health officials will provide urgent medical care to those in need, and the UNHCR will facilitate those making asylum claims in Spain.
The Aquarius is one of only three NGO boats still conducting rescue operations off the coast of Libya.
""This has been a very positive move from the new Spanish government to authorise the disembarkation of this group … We are very grateful,"" said UNHCR spokesperson Rosa Otero.
She said the people on board, who come from more than 20 countries including Eritrea, Ghana, Nigeria, and Sudan, were incredibly relieved to hear they would not be sent back to Libya, where migrants are often attacked and abused.
Despite the Italian government's hard line towards NGO rescue boats, the Italian coastguard brought 932 migrants and refugees on shore in Catania, Sicily on Wednesday after it rescued them off the coast of Libya.
So far in 2018, 44,570 refugees and migrants have crossed the Mediterranean and arrived in Europe, while 792 have died while making the perilous journey, according to the International Organization for Migration (IOM).
""What we need is for Europe not to close its borders and to have more solidarity and coordination, not responsibility shifting,"" said UNHCR's Otero.

The Aquarius, which is jointly operated by SOS Mediterranee and Doctors Beyond Borders (known by its French acronym MSF), rescued 629 people from the Mediterranean Sea and remained unable to dock since Saturday.
The ship is now headed to Spain, which offered to give it safe harbour in the eastern port of Valencia, despite concerns raised by MSF officials, saying disembarking at the closest port was preferable to a journey of an extra four days.
Here are five key things you should know.
More than 500 of the 629 migrants and refugees have now been transferred to two Italian coastguard and navy vessels, who are accompanying the Aquarius to Spain.
After the transfer, 51 women, 45 men and 10 children are left onboard the Aquarius, MSF said on Twitter on Wednesday.
Of the 629 people, there are 11 children, seven pregnant women and 123 unaccompanied minors, according to MSF.
The refugees and migrants are mainly sub-Saharan Africans who had set off from the coast of Libya to reach Europe.
The charity said the group were picked up in six different rescue operations off the coast of Libya and included hundreds who were plucked from the sea by Italian naval units and then transferred to the Aquarius.
The Aquarius is south of Sicily and is expected to enter the Sicilian channel on Wednesday evening, MSF said on Twitter.
UPDATE: People onboard #Aquarius tell #MSF team they are glad to be finally heading to a port of safety after being rescued in #Mediterranean but above all not to be returning to #Libya. pic.twitter.com/isj5LvLDys
Before the transfer to Italian navy vessels, Aloys Vimard, a project coordinator for MSF, said the boat was ""overcrowded and above capacity""
After days of drifting the Mediterranean, ""people are weak, tired, exhausted,"" Vimard told Euronews.
MSF has also expressed concern over the condition of patients who had to be resuscitated after rescue, saying they could develop ""significant pulmonary issues after swallowing sea water.""
The Italian coastguard has resupplied the refugees with oranges, cereal bars and bread.
""It’s a welcome delivery but the MSF medical team are still concerned about nutritional needs being met over the three-day journey,"" the charity group said.
Weather conditions are expected to ""worsen on Wednesday night with waves up to 4 metres and winds up to 35 knots (65 kilometres per hour),"" MSF said.
Italy's new populist government refused to give the Aquarius docking rights on Monday, citing ""illegal immigration"".
""From now also Italy begins to say NO to the traffic of human beings, NO to the business of illegal immigration,"" Matteo Salvini, Italian interior minister and head of the far-right League party, wrote on Twitter on Sunday.
""My goal is to guarantee a peaceful life for these children in Africa and for our children in Italy,"" added Salvini, who is also a deputy prime minister after campaigning on a staunchly anti-immigrant platform, vowing to ""put Italians first"" and send hundreds of thousands of undocumented migrants ""home"".
Italy had asked that those on board are made to disembark in Malta, a fellow European Union (EU) member state.
Malta, however, said it had nothing to do with the rescue operation.
""Malta is neither the competent nor the coordinating authority in this case. Malta will observe prevailing laws,"" its government said in a brief statement.
The MSF estimates the Aquarius will reach Valencia on Saturday evening, depending on the weather conditions.

The so-called ""Tampa Crisis"" occurred in 2001, when Australia's government refused to let a Norwegian container ship carrying rescued refugees ashore.

The victims of Tuesday's incident were buried under mud when surrounding hills gave way under a deluge of rain.
Eleven people died in Naniarchar including a family of four, while several people remained missing, district administrator Mamunur Rashid told the AFP news agency.
Aid agencies have been warning of the potential for a humanitarian catastrophe over the coming months as heavy rains lash an area home to the world's largest refugee camp.
Landslides have so far killed at least 13 people this week, including a Rohingya boy who was crushed to death by a collapsing mud wall at the Kutupalong refugee camp on Monday.
Some 200,000 Rohingya who live on hills around the refugee camps are at risk of death or injury from monsoon rains, officials and relief agencies have said.
Many of the hills around the settlements have been cleared of trees to build shelters, making the land highly unstable.
Nearly 29,000 people have been moved to new locations in advance of the monsoon but the risk of a tragedy remains high.
Caroline Glick from the UN Refugee Agency said many refugees were at risk of landslides as they lived on steep slopes.
""In just one area of the camp I discovered almost 20 families have had to be relocated and almost 30 houses have been damaged due to landslides,"" she said.
The region is forecast to receive 2.5 metres of rainfall during the monsoon season - roughly triple what Britain gets in a year.
Last year, monsoon rains triggered landslides in Cox's Bazar and the nearby Chittagong hill tracts, killing at least 170 people.
There are also fears flooding could spread disease in the refugee camps.
About 700,000 Muslim-majority Rohingya have fled neighbouring Myanmar since last August after an army crackdown which the UN says amounted to ""ethnic cleansing"".
They join around 300,000 refugees from earlier violence in mainly Buddhist Myanmar, where the Rohingya are a persecuted and rendered stateless.

""It's time to tell them enough. That's it,"" Gibran Bassil said to reporters during a visit to the eastern town of Arsal near the border with Syria, days after he ordered a freeze on the renewal of residency permits for UNHCR staff.
Bassil was unhappy with the information the agency gives refugees who are planning to return to Syria, which he says include an emphasis on the lack of security guarantees, possible destruction of homes and compulsory military service back home, as well as telling them the agency was not able to provide support in some parts of Syria.
""Actually, they are telling them not to go back,"" Bassil said.
The UN is angered by Bassil's accusations and Lebanon's decision to freeze renewal of residency permits for staff.
""This directly impacts UNHCR's ability to effectively carry out critical protection and solutions work in Lebanon. UNHCR hopes the decision of the foreign ministry will be reversed without delay,"" spokesman Stephane Dujarric said in New York.
Lebanon has the highest proportion of refugees in the world - more than 1.5 million, constituting about a quarter of the country's population, putting a huge strain on the economy.
Authorities in Lebanon have long complained about the burden the country carries, with officials saying it costs the country about $8bn a year.
Some groups calling for the refugees' return made major gains in last month's parliamentary elections as sentiments against the refugees are on the rise.

The Aquarius, which is jointly operated by SOS Mediterranee and Doctors Beyond Borders (known by its French acronym MSF), had rescued 629 people from the Mediterranean Sea and remained unable to dock since Saturday.
The people on board, including 11 children and seven pregnant women, are from several African countries and had set off from the coast of Libya to reach Europe.
Aloys Vimard, a project coordinator for MSF who is on board the Aquarius, said on Monday that ""although people are calm, we can see that they are getting anxious"".
""The boat is overcrowded and we are above capacity. We have very vulnerable people on board and most of them are exhausted.""
The Aquarius was denied the right to dock in Italy and Malta, the closest countries, before Spain's new Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said he would give the ship ""safe harbour"" at the eastern port of Valencia.
But MSF officials said that disembarking at the closest port was preferable to a journey of an extra four days, taking into account deteriorating weather conditions coupled with tensions and maximum capacity on board the Aquarius.
""The better option would be to disembark the rescued people in the nearest port after which they can be transferred to Spain or other safe countries for further care and legal processing,"" the organisation said.
The statement came as Italy's coastguard announced it would send two ships to take on some of the refugees to relieve overcrowding and transport them to Valencia.
MSF also expressed concern over the condition of patients who had to be resuscitated after rescue, saying they could develop ""significant pulmonary issues after swallowing sea water.""
""People rescued at sea must be disembarked in nearest safe port.""
While De Pieri welcomed the Spanish government's offer as a show of solidarity, she also said that the move ""highlights the calculated callousness of the Italian and Maltese authorities.""
""This sets a precedent that will inevitably cost lives,"" she said.
The nationalist authorities on the French island of Corsica meanwhile also offered to receive the Aquarius, in a move criticised by the central government in Paris.
""[Corsican leader Gilles Simeoni] is taking a position without having any responsibility which is easy,"" Jean-Baptiste Lemoyne, junior Europe and foreign affairs minister told Sud Radio. ""What does international law say? They need to go to the port that is safest and closest. And we can see that Corsica is not the closest or the safest. Given the boat's location, it is between Italy and Malta,"" he added.
Still, French President Emmanuel Macron criticised Italy for its ""cynicism and irresponsibility"", saying during a cabinet meeting that under maritime law ""in cases of distress, those with the closest coastline have a responsibility to respond.""
""If a boat had France as its closest coast, it could land,"" Macron's spokesman Benjamin Griveaux said.
Griveaux accused the new far-right government in Rome of lacking solidarity.
""You can't create a precedent that will enable one European country to offload onto other European countries,"" he said. ""We need to show solidarity, which Italy has not shown.""
On the other end of the spectrum, Hungary praised Italy's decision to refuse to allow refugees to dock at its ports.
Viktor Orban, the virulently anti-migrant prime minister, praised the Italian government's decision as a ""great moment which may truly bring changes in Europe's migration policies.""
Speaking at a meeting on Tuesday with his Slovak counterpart Peter Pellegrini, Orban said that it had been ""so depressing"" to hear for years that Europe's maritime borders cannot be defended that ""one practically lost the will to live.""
According to the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea, any ship learning of distress at sea must assist, no matter the circumstances.
The convention also states that the country responsible for operations in that area has primary responsibility for taking in the people on the ship.
Vimard, the MSF project coordinator on board the Aquarius, said that he is ""extremely concerned"" about how difficult it is to perform lifesaving rescue missions at sea.
""It's very worrying that once again politics are being placed above the safety of vulnerable people,"" he said in his statement.
""Anybody in distress at sea should be rescued and treated in a dignified way. European policies are criminalising and stigmatising people seeking protection and rights which are afforded to them under international humanitarian law.""
Karline Kleijer, an emergency coordinator for the MSF, said that a political game is being played over the heads of 629 people.
""This standoff shows how Europe has lost its moral compass in the Mediterranean,"" MSF quoted her as saying.

Rescue workers onboard the MV Aquarius said it will take four days to reach the port of Valencia and that the boat should be allowed access to the nearest port immediately, which currently means in Italian or Maltese territory.
""[MSF] welcomes this gesture of humanity but it would require four more days at sea in a boat already over maximum capacity and in deteriorating weather conditions,"" the organisation said in a tweet.
""This plan would mean already exhausted rescued people would endure four more days travel at sea,"" it added.
""The better option would be to disembark the rescued people in the nearest port after which they can be transferred to [Spain] or other safe countries for further care & legal processing.""
Aloys Vimard from MSF said there was enough food and water ""to give to people for two to three days"".
Regarding the planned voyage to Spain, Vimard, who is on board the ship, told Euronews: ""This is not what we wish, it's overcrowded ... people are weak, tired, exhausted.""
The Aquarius was denied the right to dock in Italy and Malta. Italy's new populist coalition government between the far-right League party and anti-establishment Five Star Movement has pledged to stop the flow of people entering the country through the Mediterranean.

Matteo Salvini, the country's new interior minister and the head of League, blocked the Aquarius' access to Italian ports.
""Saving lives at sea is a duty, but transforming Italy into an enormous refugee camp is not,"" Salvini wrote on Facebook on Monday.
After Spain's new Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez allowed the ship to dock in Valencia, Salvini celebrated the decision.
""Victory!"" He wrote on Twitter after the announcement.
The Mediterranean is a key route into Europe for refugees and migrants are using North African states, such as Libya, Tunisia, and Egypt as launch points for journeys.
In the year 2017, 171,635 migrants and refugees made the sea crossing into Europe and 3,116 people died or went missing trying to do so.
Last week, at least 112 people died in a shipwreck off the coast of Tunisia while trying to make the journey north across the Mediterranean.

""Sessions' decision is a virtual death sentence for individuals fleeing domestic violence and pervasive gang violence,"" the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) said on Twitter.
""It's not driven by legal merits but by the administration's determination to reduce immigration by any means, no matter the human consequences,"" it added.
Sessions had personally intervened in a closely watched immigration case involving a Salvadoran woman who sought asylum after being raped and threatened by her former spouse.
The woman won an appeal to the Board of Immigration Appeals to overturn a lower immigration court's decision to deny her asylum petition, but in his ruling on Monday, the attorney general said that survivors of ""private"" crimes would generally not be granted asylum.
""Generally, claims by aliens pertaining to domestic violence or gang violence perpetrated by non-governmental actors will not qualify for asylum,"" Sessions said in his decision.
""The mere fact that a country may have problems effectively policing certain crimes - such as domestic violence or gang violence - or that certain populations are more likely to be victims of crime, cannot itself establish an asylum claim,"" he added.
Sessions said that an asylum applicant ""must demonstrate members in a group, which is composed of members who share a common immutable characteristic, is defined with particularity, and is socially distinct within the society in question"".
Erika Andiola, DACA recipient
The ruling effectively reverses precedent put in place during the administration of US President Barack Obama that allowed more women to cite domestic violence and fears of gang violence as part of their asylum application.
Sessions told a group of immigration judges, who are part of the Department of Justice, on Monday that ""the asylum system is being abused to the detriment of the rule of law, sound public policy and public safety"".
He added that in his ""judgement, this is a correct interpretation of the law"".
Monday's decision was swiftly condemned by human rights groups and immigrants, who called it ""cruel and heartless"", saying it could endanger the lives of tens of thousands of women and children.
""By shutting down most claims of persecution at the hands of criminal gangs and/or intimate partners, Sessions is demonstrating his contempt for immigrants and women,"" the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) said in a statement on Monday.
""He is also providing further evidence of the Trump administration's anti-immigrant agenda, which separates families, creates fear in communities, and punishes vulnerable people who are fleeing violence and persecution in their home countries,"" he added.
Erika Andiola, a DACA recipient from Mexico and the former press secretary of Bernie Sanders, shared on Twitter that her mother was a victim of domestic violence.
""We had to cross the border to be safe so that my mom, my siblings and I could be free from pain and suffering,"" she said. ""I know exactly what it takes to migrate as a domestic violence survivor and it hurts so much to see this happening.""
My mother was a victim of domestic violence. We had to cross the border to be safe so that my mom, my siblings and I could be free from pain and suffering. I know exactly what it takes to migrate as a domestic violence survivor and it hurts so much to see this happening. #MeToo https://t.co/jD1a5Fh9oI
Many called the ruling the ""horrific"" continuation of the Trump administration's attack on women's rights and its crackdown on immigrants.
""This administration has rarely missed an opportunity to punish and hurt the most vulnerable people in our society, but even by their own shamefully low standards this is a particularly horrific move,"" Lizet Ocampo, the political director for the People for the American Way, a progressive non-profit organisation, said in a statement.
Shortly after taking office, the US president signed an executive order, expanding the powers of the Immigration Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency to focus on detaining most undocumented immigrants, including those with no criminal record.
Earlier this year, Human Rights Watch (HRW) released a report detailing the harsh conditions women and children have faced in US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) custody along the US-Mexico border.
HRW documented more than 100 cases of women and children being held in frigid conditions beyond the three-day period recommended by CBP.
There have also been allegations of sexual harassment against guards at detention centres.
Anger has continued to mount over the administration's recently introduced policy that separates children from migrant and refugee parents who are caught crossing the US-Mexico border.
""If you cross the border unlawfully … then we will prosecute you,"" Sessions said last month. ""If you're smuggling a child, then we're going to prosecute you, and that child will be separated from you, probably, as required by law,"" he added.
Trump has repeatedly rallied against immigrants since the 2016 presidential election, running on a campaign to build a wall on the US -Mexico border.
The administration has also ended Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for thousands of Salvadorans, Haitians, Nepalis, Nicaraguans and Sudanese.
Sessions' decision on Monday is likely to be challenged in court.

The MV Aquarius, which is operated by Doctors Without Borders (MSF), was as of Monday holding its position 27 nautical miles from Malta and 35 nautical miles from Italy, after the new Italian populist government refused it docking rights on its territory.
""From now also Italy begins to say NO to the traffic of human beings, NO to the business of illegal immigration,"" said Matteo Salvini, the head of the far-right League party and the country's new interior minister.
Italy has asked that those on board are made to disembark in Malta, a fellow European Union (EU) member state. Malta, however, said it had nothing to do with the rescue operation, opening the prospect of a diplomatic standoff between the two EU allies.
The boat is carrying 123 unaccompanied minors and seven pregnant women, according to MSF.
UPDATE: The #Aquarius has now received instructions from the Italian Maritime Rescue Coordination Centre to standby in our current position which is 35 nautical miles from #Italy and 27 nautical miles from #Malta.
In a thinly-veiled attack on the Italian government on Sunday, MSF said politics were ""being placed above people's lives.""
""The priority must be the importance of the well being [and] safety of the people on board,"" it said.
The UN refugee agency also called on politicians to quickly find a resolution.
""States and actors involved should rapidly find solutions to allow migrants and refugees on board the [Aquarius] to disembark safely and quickly,"" it said in a tweet.
""Hundreds of people urgently need assistance, slowing down operations puts their well being at risk.""
In a later statement, the UNHCR urged the countries involved to allow the ship to dock now and deal with the ""wider issues"" later.
""There is an urgent humanitarian imperative here,"" said Vincent Cochetel, UNHCR’s Special Envoy for the Central Mediterranean.
""People are in distress, are running out of provisions and need help quickly. Broader issues such as who has responsibility and how these responsibilities can best be shared between states should be looked at later.""

The issue had also attracted the attentions of the EU, which has called on Italy and Malta to reach a ""swift resolution"" to allow the boat to dock.
While Germany has asked the countries to ""meet their humanitarian responsibilities"".
""I can say that we are concerned about the situation of the people on this ship, the Aquarius, and that the government calls on all parties to to fulfill their humanitarian responsibility,"" said German government spokesman Steffen Seibert.
Italy's new populist government, formed of the far-right League party and the anti-establishment Five-Star Movement have built support on a pledge to stop the influx of refugees via the Mediterranean into the country, and to put ""Italians first"".

The child was so terrified of fighters returning to take him away, that he slept with a knife under his pillow.
At another camp, Kizilhan met a nine-year-old girl who was repeatedly bought, sold and raped during her three years in captivity. She now has post-traumatic stress disorder and lives in a state of dissociation.
These children are among the many survivors of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant group's brutality who are suffering from psychological trauma.
Last year, Kizilhan, dean of the Institute for Psychotherapy and Psychotraumatology at the University of Dohuk in northern Iraq, began a programme to train local students to become psychotherapists.
The need for local mental health experts and treatment in the region is immense, according to Kizilhan.
There are just 26 psychotherapists in a population of 5.5 million in Iraq's Kurdistan region, Kizilhan said at a panel on Wednesday during the two-day European Development Days conference held in Brussels, which focussed on the protection and empowerment of women.
In Dohuk province where his students work, Kizilhan said there are just five psychiatrists for a population of about two million, including more than half a million refugees.
Kizilhan is also the chief psychologist of a special asylum project financed by the German state of Baden-Wurttemberg. Starting in 2015, 1,100 severely traumatised Yazidi women and children who escaped from ISIL, were brought to the German state to receive treatment.
The asylum scheme has been criticised for uprooting the women from their culture. In response to this criticism, Kizilhan asks: ""There are roots in refugee camps?
In the past four years, Kizilhan said he has documented about 60 suicides in Iraq among survivors of ISIL sexual slavery.
Kizilhan, who comes from a Yazidi Kurd family, spoke to Al Jazeera about the importance of understanding a culture and its past in treating trauma and why he is running a programme to train future psychotherapists in northern Iraq.
Al Jazeera: How would you describe your approach to treating psychological trauma?
Jan Kizilhan: We focus on transcultural psychotherapy or transcultural trauma therapy, which means we start with the culture that people belong to. You need to know the coping strategies which are part of the culture or even the religion. You are not able to do psychotherapy with [just] modern, Western ideas of psychotherapy because psychotherapy was founded in the West, especially in America. They have a way of understanding illness and health but indigenous people have a different way to cope.
And we know from history, many times, ethnic groups, different kinds of groups, have faced major catastrophes - wars, conflicts. And somehow they find a way to cope with this conflict and grow with it. So we have to look at the resources of the people - and they have resources. We have to use these cultural resources to adapt the modern ways of medicine and psychotherapy. This is how we are working.
Al Jazeera: More than 1,000 Yazidi women and children were brought to Germany for treatment through a special programme. Where is the programme at now?
Kizilhan: The project finishes at the end of year. The women will stay in Germany and can stay indefinitely. [The aim] was to support them to deal with their trauma, to do psychotherapy, teach them German because language is very important. The children go to school. Many of them now have jobs or [are pursuing] education. This last period now is [to help] them be totally at the head of their own households and lives and to be part of society.
Jan Kizilhan, psychologist
Al Jazeera: Do you think the programme has been a success?
Kizilhan: Absolutely, yes. From 1,100 people, just 15 women returned to Iraq - to join freed family members or those with illnesses. Most wanted to stay [in Germany]. They feel accepted as women. No one asks whether they were raped or not. They have more of a feeling of freedom. In Iraq, they don't have any future. Especially for a minority like the Yazidis, the political situation is not clear.
Al Jazeera: The programme was criticised for removing the women from their culture. You've said it had to be done to save lives - that it was an emergency situation. How is the project in Dohuk different?
Kizilhan: Normally we should help people in the home of origin of the conflict. In some cases, we don't have this possibility and this was an emergency situation and we had to act. We also have traumatised refugees in Europe and we have to provide them with mental health support of which there's not enough.
We cannot bring all the traumatised refugees from Iraq and Syria to Germany. What we can do is give the [local] people the know-how to treat their own people [with their] own language and cultural background.
In 2017, we started to train and educate psychologists with a bachelor's [degree] to obtain a master's in psychology and to be licensed psychotherapists like in Germany. This [degree] continues for three years (each student must complete 1,800 hours of clinical work). In October 2018, we will start with our second group. Each group consists of 30 people and my hope and vision is that other universities in Iraq will follow us in this project and instead of having 30 psychotherapists now hopefully we'll have in 10 years 1,200 psychotherapists.
We've also started to build a trauma network which means we're bringing all actors who are somehow involved in trauma - it can be NGOs, hospitals, the state government - to give them information and discuss more about the issue of trauma because we have to reach the population. Many people don't know what psychotherapy or trauma are.
Al Jazeera: What are you seeing in terms of the local population's psychological needs?
Kizilhan: According to our observations - we are talking about northern Iraq - Daesh (ISIL) is [just] one trigger of trauma. In 1998, in Halabja, we had a chemical weapons attack by Saddam Hussein - 5,000 people were killed - and during the Anfal era, 168,000 were killed by the Saddam regime. So these historical traumas continue and evolve with ISIL.
Al Jazeera: Who are you focussing on treating?
Kizilhan: Our institution's focus is mainly now on traumatised refugees who were in ISIL captivity. We are working in 24 camps, but we are [also] open to all people in Iraq.
Al Jazeera: What are the key challenges of treating survivors of sexual violence?
Kizilhan: The first thing is to give them the confidence to talk about their feelings of shame. This is one basic part of psychotherapy, to discuss with them why they are ashamed. Sometimes they answer [that] they've lost their honour because they were raped. This idea of honour is due to a patriarchal society which sees honour as the most important value. We ask them: Who lost their honour? The perpetrator or you? Because you didn't do anything. The perpetrator lost his honour if he has any.
We have to draw on these cultural ideas and take them into account in psychotherapy - these feelings of shame, feelings of trauma, being part of a patriarchal society and apart from that, we are looking for resources.
Yazidi or other ethnic minorities, through trans-generational trauma, have a special resilience. They are very strong. They deal differently with trauma and we can use these resources, this resilience, to be more competent.
Al Jazeera: In what other ways have you tapped into this reserve of strength?
Kizilhan: Everyone we speak to we ask whether they know about ""ferman"". Ferman means holocaust against the Yazidis. They tell me [about it] through recitation, religion, books and stories. I say: Look, you are not the first one facing trauma, because your ancestors faced it, too. And if your ancestors survived, you will also survive. And the difference between you and your ancestors is that I'm here as a therapist to work with you. Your ancestor had no psychotherapist 300 years ago and they survived. So we try to activate that.

Spain's Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez, a socialist who took office just over a week ago, gave instructions for the humanitarian vessel to be admitted to the eastern port of Valencia, his office said in a statement on Monday.
The Aquarius took the people, including seven pregnant women, from inflatable boats off the coast of Libya at the weekend.
It sailed north towards Italy, but Matteo Salvini, head of the far-right League party who became interior minister this month vowing to curb an influx of migrants from Africa, blocked it and said it should go to Malta, a fellow European Union member, instead.
""Saving lives at sea is a duty, but transforming Italy into an enormous refugee camp is not,"" Salvini wrote on Facebook on Monday.
Malta refused, saying it had nothing to do with the rescue mission, which was overseen by Italian coastguard.
Valencia is almost three days' voyage for the Aquarius, while Italy and Malta are just hours away.
Aloys Vimad, from Doctors without Borders, one of the group' co-operating the Aquarius, said there was enough food and water ""to give to people for two to three days"".
Commenting about heading to Spain, Vimad, who is on board the ship, told Euronews: ""This is not what we wish, it's overcrowded ... people are weak, tired, exhausted.""
Antoine Laurent, from SOS Mediterranee, which also co-operates the ship, echoed the same sentiment.
Speaking to Al Jazeera, he said the charity acknowledged Spain's solidarity but stressed that heading there was not their decision.
""[Italy] is under command and they have to take that decision,"" he said.
""It's also technically not really easy for us to go to Spain, we will need at least two more days of sailing, which is not possible,"" he added. ""We urge Italy to find a solution very soon close to our position.""
But following Sanchez's move, Salvini wrote on Twitter: ""Victory!""
""To politely raise one's voice pays off,"" Salvini told a news conference in Milan. ""It's something Italy hasn't done for many years.""
Earlier, the UN's refugee agency called on politicians to find a solution.
""States and actors involved should rapidly find solutions to allow migrants and refugees on board to disembark safely and quickly,"" it said in a tweet.
""Hundreds of people urgently need assistance, slowing down operations puts their well being at risk.""

Al Jazeera's Jonah Hull reporting from Rome said hopes were really low.
""[People] are hoping they will get some sort of solution from the Italian authorities but it rather sounds as if this is a government cementing a new policy, rather than preparing to change its mind.""

Malta said it had nothing to do with the rescue operation, opening the prospect of a diplomatic standoff between the two European Union allies.
""From now also Italy begins to say NO to the traffic of human beings, NO to the business of illegal immigration,"" Matteo Salvini, Italian interior minister and head of the far-right League party, wrote on Twitter on Sunday.
""My goal is to guarantee a peaceful life for these children in Africa and for our children in Italy,"" added Salvini, who is also a deputy prime minister after campaigning on a staunchly anti-immigrant platform, vowing to ""put Italians first"" and send hundreds of thousands of undocumented migrants ""home"".
More than 600,000 people have reached Italy by boat from Africa in the past five years. Numbers have dropped dramatically in recent months, but there has been a rise in rescues in recent days, presenting Salvini with his first test as minister.
Earlier on Sunday, the charity SOS Mediterranee on Twitter that its rescue ship, The Aquarius, had taken on board 629 refugees and migrants, including 123 unaccompanied minors, 11 other children and seven pregnant women.
The charity said the group of mainly sub-Saharan Africans were picked up in six different rescue operations off the coast of Libya and included hundreds who were plucked from the sea by Italian naval units and then transferred to The Aquarius.
""The boat is now heading north towards a secure port,"" SOS Mediterranee tweeted on Sunday without specifying its destination, though virtually every such boat over the past five years has ended up in Italy.
Its route north will take it past Malta, and an official said that Salvini had written to the government of the small island state asking it to let The Aquarius dock there.
The official, who asked not to be identified, said that Italy would not open its ports to the NGO's vessel, according to the Reuters news agency.
Italian media also reported the same letter.
According to the daily Corriere Della Sera, the letter describes Malta's capital, Valletta, as the ""most secure port"" and the boat should thus dock there. La Repubblica also published a story about the letter.
There was no comment from the Italian Ministry of the Interior or the local coastguard.
Malta said the rescue operations happened in international waters off Libya and were coordinated by Italy.
""Malta is neither the competent nor the coordinating authority in this case. Malta will observe prevailing laws,"" its government said in a brief statement.
Salvini, 45, has continued with his anti-refugee rhetoric since taking control of the interior ministry, asking on Friday for NATO to defend Italy, which he says is ""under attack from the south"".
His stance on immigration has been enshrined in the 57-page contract the League agreed to with government coalition partner Five Star Movement. Headed by Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, the government was inaugurated last week.
The immigration section of the policy document calls for the deportation of Italy's estimated 500,000 undocumented immigrants ""as a priority"", building more detention centres and a review of the European Union's Dublin Regulation, which stipulates that migrants and refugees apply for asylum in the first EU country they reach.
Salvini's comments on Sunday came after another spat with Malta following its reported refusal to come to the aid of another rescue ship, Seefuchs, which was stranded with 126 refugees on board due to violent seas until it was allowed to dock in the Sicilian port of Pozzallo on Saturday.

The TEDxKakumaCamp, held on Saturday at the Kakuma refugee camp in northwest Kenya, brought together current and former refugees, as well as activists and aid workers, to share their experiences in an effort to change perceptions and break stereotypes.
The one-day gathering marked the first time that TED - the influential conference network that hosts online talks on a range of scientific, cultural and academic topics around the world - held an event at a refugee camp.
Among the speakers at the event was South Sudanese track-and-field athlete Yiech Pur Biel, who represented the first-ever Refugee Olympic Team at the 2016 Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro and Somali American supermodel Halima Aden, who grew up at the Kakuma camp.
After returning to Kakuma for the first time since moving to the United States at the age of six, Aden said she has had many flashbacks.
""A lot of girls, not just Muslims, follow my journey who may come from a similar background,"" she told Al Jazeera's The Stream programme.
Over the past year and a half, the 20-year-old model, who wears a hijab, has appeared in nine magazine covers, including Vogue.
The hijab is a headscarf worn by Muslim women who feel it is part of their religion.
""To think two years ago, I could even pick up a magazine and flip the inside pages and see someone dressed like me. So, it's been quite the journey.""
A former refugee from South Sudan, Mary Nyiriak Maker, who now teaches at the Kakuma camp, was also on the line-up of speakers
The 22-year-old said she returned in the hope of inspiring young people.
""I look at the population in the camp, especially, the population of the young - most of them are hopeless - and seeing me as their teacher who is almost their peer, will actually encourage them to move on, to push on, to see that life is not about the camp.""
""Life is something more ahead and that's what I want them to believe.""

The Kakuma camp was set up in 1992, initially to take in mostly Sudanese refugees. It is now hosting about 185,000 people who have fled war or persecution from 19 African countries.
A May 2018 report by the World Bank's International Finance Corporation and the UNHCR estimates Kakuma's informal economy is worth $56m.
""Everybody here says that they believe an event like this is extremely important, not just because it counteracts negative stereotypes about refugees but also it will inspire so many refugees around the world,"" said Al Jazeera's Mohammed Jamjoom, reporting from Kakuma.
Melissa Fleming, chief spokesperson for the UN's refugee agency, UNHCR, and co-host of TEDxKakumaCamp, said the event was the ""most logistically challenging, but also one of the most moving"" staged by the TED organisation.
""Most Europeans, Australians and Americans think that all the refugees are coming their way, but frankly most of them are in countries like Kenya and yet they're invisible,"" she told Al Jazeera.
""We are hoping with this event, we could really illuminate the camp but also the extraordinary refugees, the talents and ideas they have by putting them on as powerful a stage as the TED stage,"" Fleming added.

And they say the UN refugee agency is trying to prevent that from happening, accusing the organisation of deliberately discouraging refugees from returning.
The UNHCR has refuted the accusations.
The caretaker foreign ministry has decided to suspend residency applications submitted by UNHCR staff as a first step against the organisation.

Caretaker Foreign Minister Gebran Bassil said on Friday the agency hindered the return of refugees by ""spreading fear"", adding that he would consider taking further measures against the body.
According to a statement by the Lebanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, UNHCR staff were discouraging Syrians' return home by ""asking specific questions that frighten them"" related to the security situation in Syria and their repatriation without international oversight.
""The UNHCR was telling them specifically 'do not return' which is not their mandate,"" Ghadi al-Khoury, an official at the foreign ministry, told Al Jazeera.
""The mandate of the UNHCR is - at least what they say is - that 'we want to make sure people know what they are doing' but what is actually happening is much more than that,"" he added.
The agency denied the accusations, saying it is carrying out its global mandate of providing support to refugees and help them re-establish their lives in line with international standards.
""The UNHCR is not deterring returns,"" spokesperson Lisa Abu Khaled told Al Jazeera.
""The UNHCR has expressed many times that it respects the Lebanese government's decision that local integration is not an option.""
While Turkey hosts the highest number of Syrian refugees, estimated by the UNHCR at 3.5 million, Lebanon has the highest proportion of refugees in the world - more than 1.5 million, which constitutes about a quarter of the country's population.
Authorities in Lebanon have long complained about the burden the country carries, with officials saying it costs the country about $8bn a year.
Al Jazeera's Zeina Khodr, reporting from Lebanon's capital, Beirut, said Bassil might be acting in a caretaker capacity but he belongs to the ruling alliance which means that his decision could be a reflection of the state's future policy.
""Some officials are using the refugee file for political capital. They play on fears about the impact of the prolonged presence of refugees in the country,"" Khodr said.
""Those officials belong to the Syrian government camp. They want refugee returns to be coordinated with the authorities in Damascus as a first step toward restoring relations with the government of President Bashar al-Assad.""
Khodr said large scale returns give legitimacy to the Syrian government which wants the international community to provide badly-needed funds for reconstruction in the war-torn country.
The UN, in turn, says it neither encourages nor does it discourage returns but that it will not organise returns while discussions with Damascus continue on safeguards that still need to be put in place.
""Although there is a consensus among all the Lebanese that the Syrian refugee crisis is a huge burden on the Lebanese economy and demographics, still the Lebanese are divided on how this should be dealt with,"" Sami Nader, of the Levant Institute for Strategic Affairs, told Al Jazeera from Beirut.
""Some in the government want to directly coordinate with the Syrian regime which might be perceived as de facto normalisation.""

The troops were released on Monday after an order extending their custody expired. A decision on their asylum applications is still pending.
""We have a bilateral re-admission agreement, we have suspended that re-admission agreement,"" Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu was quoted as saying by state-run Anadolu news agency on Thursday.
He said a separate migrant deal between the European Union and Turkey would continue.
Under the bilateral deal signed in 2001, 1,209 foreign nationals have been deported to Turkey from Greece in the last two years.
Cavusoglu said he believed the Greek government wanted to resolve the issue with the Turkish soldiers, but Greek judges were under pressure from the West.
Turkey has repeatedly called for the extradition of the suspected coup-plotters. Greek courts have rejected the requests and the soldiers have denied any wrongdoing, adding they fear for their lives.
The soldiers arrived to Greece on board a stolen military helicopter hours after the failed coup that killed hundreds and wounded thousands.
Turkish soldiers and tanks took to the streets in July 2016 as explosions rang out in Ankara and Istanbul. Turkish fighter jets dropped bombs on their own parliament.
After the putsch was quickly put down, a state of emergency was imposed under which more than 150,000 people were taken into custody with 110,000 civil servants dismissed, according to recent European Commission report.
Turkey's Western allies have repeatedly condemned the Turkish government's detentions and purges, and rights groups accuse Ankara of using the coup d'etat as a pretext to silence opposition in the country.
The government says the purges and detentions are in line with the rule of law.

Speaking at a press briefing on Monday, Pakistani military spokesperson Major-General Asif Ghafoor said he wished for all issues between the nuclear-armed neighbours to be resolved through dialogue.
""War is a failure of diplomacy,"" he said. ""We are two nuclear states, there is no space for war. So dialogue continues. India has always been the one to back out from dialogue, not Pakistan.""
India and Pakistan, partitioned when the Indian subcontinent gained independence from the British in 1947, have fought two of their three wars over the disputed northern region of Kashmir, which both claim in full but administer separate portions.
Pakistan and India-administered Kashmir are divided by the Line of Control (LoC), a boundary along which both sides have massed military personnel. A ceasefire was signed in 2003, but has been frequently violated in recent years.
This year, Indian forces fired upon targets on the Pakistani side of the Line of Control at least 1,577 times, Ghafoor alleged, killing 48 people and wounding more than 265.
India's foreign ministry says Pakistan has violated the ceasefire at least 1,088 times in 2018, killing 36 people and wounding 127 others.
On May 29, the Indian and Pakistani militaries renewed their commitment to the 2003 ceasefire, according to statements released by both.
""Both [senior military officers] also agreed that in case of any issue, restraint will be exercised and the matter will be resolved through utilisation of existing mechanisms of hotline contacts and border flag meetings at local commander's level,"" a Pakistani statement said.
Sporadic firing, however, has continued on both sides.
In his wide-ranging press conference, Ghafoor also spoke of how Pakistan's relations with the United States, an erstwhile ally in the war against armed groups, was ""under stress"".
""There is a great deal of dialogue happening on the diplomatic level as well as on security assistance,"" he added, however.
The United States accuses Pakistan of providing sanctuary to armed groups - including the Afghan Taliban and Haqqani Network - that it is fighting in neighbouring Afghanistan. In January, US President Donald Trump cut roughly $1.1bn in security aid to Pakistan over the issue.
Pakistan denies the charge, and Ghafoor reiterated Pakistan's position on Monday.
""Before [a 2014 military operation], it was a question of capacity, not the will. But from [2014] onwards, we have wiped out all terrorist organisations across the board, and right now there is no organised infrastructure of any terrorist organisation, including the Haqqani Network [in Pakistan],"" he said.
The military spokesperson linked the issue of the group's possible ""residual strength"" with the presence of Afghan refugees in the country, saying refugee camps allowed fighters safe havens from which to operate.
Pakistan is home to roughly 1.4 million registered Afghan refugees, according to the UN refugee agency.
While Pakistan has often carried out raids on refugee settlements in the wake of ""terrorist attacks"", it has yet to publicly charge a refugee with abetting attacks on Pakistani soil.

The controversial set of measures, known collectively and informally as the ""Stop Soros"" bill, were considered by politicians on Tuesday in the capital, Budapest.
The draft bill, named after Hungarian-American billionaire George Soros, targets NGOs and people deemed to be aiding people seeking asylum.
It is part of a campaign by Orban, encouraged by a landslide win in parliamentary elections in April, against Soros, who is accused by the ruling party Fidesz of encouraging refugees to go to the central European country.
According to the government, NGOs mainly financed by Soros work as ""a network to facilitate illegal migration"".
""The people of Hungary have made it clear that they do not want Hungary to become an immigrant country,"" the Hungarian government's international communications office told Al Jazeera in a statement.
""It is our firm position that immigration poses a major risk and for this very reason it is a national security issue.""
Refugee rights activists and NGOs have slammed the draft bill for cracking down on the asylum-seeking process.
""Access of justice and due process are fundamental European values and this legislation specifically targets that, saying asylum seekers shouldn't be helped because if you help asylum seekers, you face the risk of being thrown in jail,"" said Marta Pardavi, co-chair at Helsinki Committee for Human Rights.
The UN's refugee agency, UNHCR, has also urged the government to scrap the draft law.
""UNHCR is seriously concerned that these proposals, if passed, would deprive people who are forced to flee their homes of critical aid and services, and further inflame tense public discourse and rising xenophobic attitudes,"" it said in a statement last week.
Orban's right-wing government wants the constitution changed so other European Union countries can't transfer asylum seekers to Hungary.
Al Jazeera's Jonah Hull reporting from Budapest said: ""The advance of Viktor Orban and his policies have proved to be unstoppable in three consecutive elections.
""It is as if this new law is aimed less at illegal migrants and more at civil society - the NGOs that promote individual rights over the excesses of the state.""

Demonstrators converged near the cabinet office and chanted slogans calling for the sacking of Prime Minister Hani al-Mulki, vowing they would disband only if the government rescinded a tax bill it sent to parliament last month, which critics say worsens living standards.
""We are here until we bring the downfall of the bill... This government is shameful!"" demonstrators chanted as police prevented them from approaching the heavily guarded government offices.
""Our demands are legitimate. No, no to corruption!"" they yelled, urging King Abdullah II, who is seen as a unifying force, to intervene and crack down on official corruption.
About 3,000 people faced down a heavy security presence to gather near the prime minister's office in Amman in the early hours of Sunday, waving Jordanian flags and signs reading ""we will not kneel"".
Protests have gripped the country since Wednesday when hundreds responding to a call by trade unions, flooded the streets of Amman and other cities to demand the fall of the government.
""Women have started looking in rubbish bins to find food for their children, and every day we're hit by price hikes and new taxes,"" said one protester.
Bank employee Mohammad Shalabiya, 28, said demonstrators wanted ""to tell the government that the citizen's income isn't suitable for this kind of law and that we have a right to demonstrate"".
The Senate convened hours after protests ended on Sunday to discuss ""ways of dealing with draft law... in the interest of all parties"", Jordan's official Petra news agency said.
Senate speaker Faisal al-Fayez there was a need for ""comprehensive national dialogue"" on the law.
Al-Fayez said the government should ""balance economic challenges and pressures with the interests of different social sectors"", but cautioned against violence and called on authorities to bring ""troublemakers"" to justice.
Last month, the government proposed an income tax draft law, yet to be approved by parliament, aimed at raising taxes on employees by at least five percent and on companies by between 20 and 40 percent.
The measures are the latest in a series of economic reforms since Amman secured a $723m three-year credit line from the International Monetary Fund in 2016.
Since January, Jordan - which suffers high unemployment and has few natural resources - has seen repeated price rises, including on staples such as bread, as well as extra taxes on basic goods.
The price of fuel has risen on five occasions since the beginning of the year, while electricity bills have shot up 55 percent since February.
The IMF-backed measures have sparked some of the biggest economic protests in five years.
Overnight, protesters outside al-Mulki's office shouted slogans including ""the ones raising prices want to burn the country"" and ""this Jordan is our Jordan, al-Mulki should leave"".
Lina Rsheidat, 35, a housewife with a red keffiyeh around her neck, said the proposed law was ""unjust"" and would ""harm the Jordanian people"".
According to official estimates, 18.5 percent of the population is unemployed, while 20 percent are on the brink of poverty.
The Economist Intelligence Unit earlier this year ranked Jordan's capital as one of the most expensive in the Arab world.
Jordan, a key US ally, has largely avoided the unrest witnessed by other countries in the region since the Arab Spring revolts broke out in 2011, although protests did flare up late that year after the government cut fuel subsidies.
But the country has long played host to refugees from neighbouring Iraq, and according to government figures, more than one million people have fled to Jordan from Syria's devastating seven-year war, exacerbating its struggling economy.
Amman has repeatedly urged international donors to provide extra funds to help it host these refugees.
On Saturday, al-Mulki met trade union representatives who demanded the income tax law be revoked, but they failed to reach an agreement.
The head of Jordan's federation of unions, Ali Obus, demanded that the state ""maintain its independence and not bow to IMF demands"".
King Abdullah II called on parliament to lead a ""comprehensive and reasonable national dialogue"" on the new tax law.
""It would not be fair that the citizen alone bears the burden of financial reforms,"" he told officials on Saturday.
The IMF says the loan aims at slashing Jordan's public debt from about 94 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) to 77 percent by 2021, through ""reforms to bolster economic growth and gradual fiscal consolidation"", according to its website.
A majority of 78 out of parliament's 130 representatives are opposed to the income tax law.

Mulki submitted his resignation in a meeting with King Abdullah II on Monday.
His resignation comes amid mass protests over price hikes and an income tax reform bill.
According to an official source, the move is aimed at defusing the anger over the economic policies.
Protests have been taking place across the capital Amman and other towns for the last four days. Protesters are calling for the government to scrap the bill. They were also demanding the removal of Mulki, whose government had proposed raising the income tax by at least five percent.
His Majesty King Abdullah II accepted the resignation of Hani Mulki's government #Jordan
Mulki assumed office in 2016 and was responsible for improving the country's economy amid regional turmoil and a refugee crisis.
In the wake of Mulki's resignation, Jordanian King Abdullah asked Omar al-Razzaz to form a new government.
Al-Razzaz, a former World Bank economist, is described as a more ""likeable"" and ""accepted"" character among the Jordanian people.
Yet, some have questioned whether al-Razzaz will have what it takes to defuse the current tensions.
Musa al-Adwan, a retired Jordanian army general and former deputy chief of staff, told Al Jazeera that while he highly respects al-Razzaz, ""he is not fit the lead the government at this critical junction.""""Al-Razzaz is a technocrat that cannot and should not lead the country during this explosive situation,"" al-Adwan said.
""This is unreal,"" he added.
Ahmad al-Hajaya, a spokesman for Jordanian Teachers Syndicate, told Al Jazeera that the current change in the government appears to be more or less ""a change of faces only.""
Al-Hajaya said that al-Razzaz is known among the teachers' union as an honest public servant.
""Unless al-Razzaz is given broad authority to combat corruption and restore public trust, his mandate will not succeed,"" he said, adding that his syndicate will continue protesting as long as the proposed law remains on the table.
Abdallah Ghoushe, a member of Jordan's 140,000-strong Engineers Association Board told Al Jazeera that the sacking of former PM Mulki is a good step that might calm the street, but won't put an end to the protests.
""Our issue with the government is its proposed tax law and other economic policies,"" he said.
""If this is not resolved as soon as possible, the conflict with the government will remain.""
Jordan has long suffered from economic problems and remains heavily reliant on foreign aid. Earlier this year, Jordanians demanded the removal of bread subsidies and protested a sales tax rise.
According to Rami Khouri, a senior fellow and professor at the American University of Beirut, these problems are structural in nature.
""The government can't keep up with the economic growth rate to provide jobs or with the expenditures to provide essential services such as housing, security, and education,"" he told Al Jazeera.
As part of a series of economic reforms to decrease Jordan's national debt of $37bn, which is equivalent to 95 percent of the gross domestic product (GDP), the government introduced price increases on basic commodities that have angered many Jordanians.
The cost of fuel has increased five times in 2018, and electricity bills have shot up to 55 percent.
These measures stem from the $723m three-year credit line that the government secured from the International Monetary Fund in 2016.

""Consecutive governments have been dealing with the Jordanian citizens with total disregard, no accountability and no sense of the concept of social justice,"" said Lamis Andoni, an independent journalist based in Amman.
""The income tax was just the trigger that just brought everything to the surface and united many people.""
The protests in Amman are mostly led by the Communist party and the Hirak Shababi, or youth movement, an independently affiliated group.
While protests in the capital have been peaceful, in some provinces protesters closed down main roads by setting tyres on fire and threw rocks at the police.
A majority of 78 out of parliament's 130 representatives are opposed to the income tax law.
Unions representing tens of thousands of employees in both the public and private sectors have also called for a general strike on Wednesday, if the people's demands are not met by then.
The government says it needs more funds for public services and argues that tax changes reduce social inequalities by placing a heavier load on high earners almost exclusively.
Experts say the IMF-imposed fiscal consolidation plan has worsened the situation for poorer Jordanian citizens, and is catching up to the country's middle class.

On Sunday, the Slovenia Democratic Party (SDS) clinched 25 percent of the national vote.
Although it remains unclear if SDS will be able to form a coalition, the party's campaign tactics and rhetoric have aroused concern among analysts who track the ongoing developments around right-wing and far-right populist parties in Europe.
The List of Marjan Sarec (LMS), an anti-establishment party, came in second with just under 13 percent of the vote.
Meanwhile, the centre-left Social Democrats earned 10 percent, the centrist Moderate Centre Party 9.75 percent and the left-wing Levica party nine percent.
With a population of more than two million, Slovenia gained its independence from the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in 1991 and was recognised by the European Union the following year.
Despite gaining the largest number of votes, a broader coalition of centrist and left-leaning parties could potentially exclude the SDS.
Far-right Hungarian leader Viktor Orban, who recently won re-election after campaigning on an intensely anti-refugee and anti-Muslim platform, is a vocal backer of the SDS and its leader, former Prime Minister Janez Jansa.
SDS topped the vote at a time when Europe is still reeling from staunchly anti-migrant parties making significant gains in Austria, Italy and elsewhere.
Peter Kreko, executive director of Political Capital: Policy Research and Consulting Institute, described the results as ""part of the populist zeitgeist"".
Speaking to Al Jazeera, Kreko argued the SDS's electoral campaign was indicative of ""Orban's soft power"" in Central Europe and the Balkans.
While stressing that Slovenia's SDS garnered far less support than Orban's ultra-nationalist Fidesz party in Hungary's elections, Kreko said ""fear mongering over immigration"" and ""xenophobia"" are qualities both share.
""The experience of other European countries is that, when a populist party brings this type of message, it has an impact on the broader political spectrum,"" he said.
Like many analysts, Kreko said Orban's open endorsement of the 59-year-old Jansa and his party were part of a broader transnational process of the Hungarian leader spreading his influence throughout the region.
Orban has nurtured ties with Serbia's ruling party, Prime Minister Aleksandar Vucic's Serbia Progressive Party, as well as anti-liberal outfits in Croatia, Macedonia and Poland, among others.
Those efforts have been accompanied by a campaign orchestrated by pro-Orban media to buy up news outlets in Macedonia and push for greater influence in the Balkans, as recently reported by the Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP).
Jansa, who served as Slovenia's prime minister from 2004 to 2008 and again from February 2012 to March 2013, declared his party's intentions to put ""Slovenians first"" after the preliminary results were announced.
Throughout the campaigning period, Jansa honed in on refugees and migrants, and on Sunday evening he reiterated his rhetoric by proclaiming that migration was ""the most serious challenge"" for the majority of Europeans.
The tunnel-vision focus on refugees and migrants ""is something that resonates even in countries where there are practically no immigrants"", according to Kreko.
""It is xenophobia without the presence of immigrants, and this is partially the case in Slovenia as well,"" he added.
More than half a million refugees and migrants passed through Slovenia in 2015 and 2016, although the overwhelming majority continued their journeys to elsewhere in Europe.
In March 2016, Slovenia joined several other countries in central Europe and the Balkans when it sealed its borders to asylum seekers fleeing war and economic devastation.
Noting that it would be an immense struggle for the SDS to form a coalition, Mojca Pajnik, a research councilor at the Ljubljana-based Peace Institute, argued the party has been ""developing clear features of extremist right-wing populism"" in recent years.
As part of the right-wing European People's Party alliance in the European Parliament, the SDS is aligned with the ruling Austria People's Party, Greece's right-wing New Democracy and Poland's conservative Civic Platform, among others.
In the past, SDS has been criticised for its alleged ties with the anti-Muslim, far-right Identitarian movement and other right-wing youth movements.
""They've been radicalising in the sense of moving toward more and more elements of autocracy and a more totalitarian way of understanding politics,"" Pajnik told Al Jazeera.
""In the last decade, these feelings have been strengthened.""
According to Pajnik, the SDS ""literally copied Orban's campaign"" by employing ""racialised rhetoric"" in the latest elections.
""Slovenia was flooded with hostile billboards across the country in [recent] months… Some were attacking NGOs that work on human rights issues. The notion of security of the natives against the insecurity [posed] by migrants was put into focus.""
In May, Orban chimed in when he stated ""the survival of the Slovenian people"" could only be guaranteed by the SDS winning.
Hurdles remain for the SDS and the only party that has expressed willingness to negotiate a coalition with Jansa is New Slovenia, a conservative Christian party that clenched seven percent of the vote on Sunday.
""The good news, speaking from the perspective of human rights, is that many people voted for the left and centre-left,"" Pajnik continued.
""This also means they said 'no' to the Orbanisation of politics in Slovenia.""

SDS leader and former Prime Minister Janez Jansa was forced to resign five years ago after a corruption scandal but has made a comeback, thanks in part to his strong rhetoric on immigration.

Slovenia was a key transit route for migrants and refugees trying to reach northern European states during the European refugee crisis of 2015.

The centre-right Slovenian Democratic Party secured 25 percent of the vote, the State Election Commission said late on Sunday.
The anti-establishment LMS party of comedian-turned-politician Marjan Sarec had 12 percent, followed by the centre-left Social Democrats with 10 percent, and the SMC party of outgoing Prime Minister Miro Cerar at 9 percent.
The results mean a coalition government will have to be formed because no party achieved a majority.
In a statement after polls closed, Jansa, 59, said he was committed to forming a government ""for the good of all our citizens"" and to ensure a ""safe Slovenia"".
Sarec said he also expects to be in position to form the government and is ruling out a coalition with Jansa. Most parties said before the vote they were unlikely to join an SDS-led government because of its harsh stance towards migrants.
Speaking to the POP TV station after polls closed, Sarec said he was ""very happy"" with the preliminary results, hinting it could give him the opportunity to band with other parties to keep Jansa out of power.
During the campaign Sarec said Jansa's anti-immigration rhetoric ""crossed all the red lines"".

Saudi Arabia, together with several other Arab nations, launched a military campaign in 2015 in support of Yemen's internationally recognised government aiming to roll back advances made by Houthi rebels after they overran much of the country in 2014.
Most countries have since withdrawn their forces from the coalition, with only Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates conducting attacks in Yemen.
Hudaida lies some 230km away from the capital, Sanaa, which is controlled by the Houthis.
In recent days, pro-government forces have closed in on the city, driving the rebels from dozens of nearby towns and villages amid growing fears that an all-out assault is imminent.
Aid agencies say it is the city's location on the Red Sea that makes it such a strategic prize. If the Saudi-led coalition takes over, it would effectively be in control of Yemen's most vital lifeline and the main gateway for imports of relief supplies and commercial goods.
An alarming 22.2 million people in Yemen need some kind of humanitarian or protection assistance, according to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA).
About 90 percent of Yemen's food and most of its medicine is imported through Hudaida, Yemen's third largest city and home to about 400,000 people.
Jan Egeland, secretary-general of the Norwegian Refugee Council, equated Hudaida to what Rotterdam historically represented for the Netherlands and Liverpool for the United Kingdom.
""It's the place where things come into all the civilian population in Yemen, a country that basically has to import all food,"" Egeland told Al Jazeera from Norway's capital, Oslo.
He said a potential attack by the coalition would make the situation ""much worse"".
""In many ways, Yemen is today the country on Earth where there is the highest number of people who are food insecure [and] who are on the brink of famine,"" he added.
""We must avoid war at all costs in Hudaida, not only because of the hundreds of thousands of people who would get in the crossfire but also because the port will be destroyed and the lifeline will be destroyed.""
Riyadh sees Hudaida port as the entry point of weaponry for the Houthis and has accused its regional rival Iran of sending missiles to the rebels, a charge Tehran has denied. Aid agencies say, 200,000 people - about half of Hudaida's population - could be displaced if fighting breaks out in the centre.
A statement by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) on Thursday raised concern for civilians in the densely populated city.
""People are afraid of the fighting within their city and making an already catastrophic situation even worse,"" the statement said.
""The ICRC is [in] line with international humanitarian law urges all the parties to the conflict to respect civilian lives by taking every possible measure to protect civilians""
Civilians must be protected Hospitals & schools are #NotATarget @ICRC_ye is concerned about the fighting along the Red Sea coast of #Yemen pic.twitter.com/TgMP9qEk4M
For his part, Egeland suggested that the city ought to be internationally-administered, given its significance to the wellbeing of the civilian population, and asked that key powers increase pressure to the warring parties in order to bring about a political solution to the conflict, which has killed more than 10,000 people.
""What we asked for is that the United States, the United Kingdom and France who have influence over the Saudi-led coalition - they sell arms, they have close military relations, close diplomatic and intelligence cooperation - guarantee that attacks stop.
""On the other hand, Iran who are close to the Houthis, they haven't either done what they should do to de-escalate the fighting,"" he added.
""We need a ceasefire and peace talks to succeed.""

The agreement announced by the government and two UN agencies on Thursday calls for a framework of cooperation that will lead to the ""voluntary, safe, dignified and sustainable"" repatriation of Rohingya refugees ""to their places of origin or of their choosing"".
The UN refugee agency said that the conditions for voluntary return are not conducive yet.
The memorandum of understanding, which is expected to be signed next week, ""is the first and necessary step to support the government's efforts to change that situation and is also intended to support recovery and resilience-based development for the benefit of all communities living in Rakhine State,"" UNHCR said in a statement.
Myanmar and Bangladesh agreed in November to begin repatriating the Rohingya, but the refugees expressed concern that they would be forced to return to unsafe conditions in Myanmar if the process is not monitored by international aid groups.
The government said in a statement that it signed the agreement with the UN Development Programme and the UN refugee agency for their assistance so that verified displaced people ""can return voluntarily in safety and dignity"".
The UN said the agreement also provides for the two agencies to be given access to western Rakhine State, where most of the violence against the Rohingya has occurred since August.
It said that it will allow the refugee agency to assess the situation, carry out protection activities, and provide information to refugees about conditions in their home areas so that they can better decide whether they want to return.
Myanmar's security forces have been accused of rape, killing, torture and the burning of Rohingya homes.
The UN and the United States have described the army crackdown as ""ethnic cleansing"".
The government has denied the accusations.
The government of predominantly Buddhist Myanmar says Rohingya are illegal migrants from Bangladesh, even though most have lived in the country for generations.
Myanmar has said so far it will only allow refugees with identity documents, which most Rohingya lack, to return.

https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/06/americans-protest-inhumane-family-separation-policy-180601194614069.html,refugee,912,Fri Jun 01 2018 22:58:39 GMT+0000,Azad Essa,Americans protest against 'inhumane' family separation policy,"Washington, DC - Thousands of people have rallied in cities across the United States, calling on President Donald Trump to reverse a policy of separating undocumented parents from their children.
The protests on Friday, organised by a coalition of groups, was part of a National Day of Action dubbed ""Families Belong Together"" after it emerged that children were being separated from their families while trying to cross the southwest border with Mexico.
In two weeks of May alone, some 658 children were separated from their parents.
Carrying posters, placards and chanting slogans, protesters demanded that the Trump administration end funding to the controversial Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs Border Patrol. They also called on Trump to end family separations through the policy of prosecuting undocumented migrants.
Reverend Jennifer Butler, from Faith in Public Life, called the policy as a ""moral abomination"".
""The country is polarised, but we are here to win hearts and minds and to push back on immoral policies,"" Butler told Al Jazeera, on the fringes of the protest in Washington, DC, where about 400 people gathered outside the Department of Justice.
Thousands of people were expected to rally in nearly 30 cities across the country, including Oakland, Las Vegas, Allentown, Miami, Cleveland and New York City.
Activists said the practice of separating families has existed since the George W Bush administration (2001-2009), but had not been used as a matter of policy until the Trump era. In the past, families would be held and often deported. Under the new policy, parents are charged with ""illegal entry"" even if they are asylum seekers.
""It happened under [George W] Bush and under [Barack] Obama. Trump has basically taken the worst policy and made it evil,"" Jess Morales Rocketto, chair of We Belong Together, a campaign that pivots women to the centre of immigration policies, told Al Jazeera.
Though Trump has publicly admonished the practice, members of his administration continue to justify it for acting as an effective deterrent.
In March, the Department of Homeland Security announced they were considering separating undocumented children from their parents. In May, Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced a ""zero tolerance"" policy. He said adults would be criminally prosecuted while children would be separated and placed in alternate care.
""If you don't want your child separated, then don't bring them across the border illegally,"" Sessions said.
Immigrant rights activists argue that many of those coming to the US through the southwest border are fleeing violence in Central America and deserve to be treated as asylum seekers.
The prosecution of asylum seekers is in contravention of the 1967 Refugee Convention to which the US is a signatory.
Rocketto, the campaigner, says that sobbing children, including toddlers, have been ""ripped away"" as their parents are being handcuffed.
The children are passed on to the Office of Refugee Resettlement, a branch of the Department of Health and Human Services.
The separation can last months while parents are charged with ""illegal entry"". First-time offenders can face up to six months in jail, while repeat offenders are charged with ""illegal re-entry"". Those found guilty can be imprisoned for up to two years.
Butler, the reverend, said treating asylum seekers with such cruelty ""was evil"".
""We are the richest country in the world, there is no way anyone can ever agree with such a policy,"" Butler said.
Before being implemented, the policy was piloted in New Mexico between July and November 2017. According to immigration officials, the number of families attempting to cross without documents decreased by 64 percent.
""Trump has a mission. It goes back to his statement of making America great again,"" Christopher Enriquez, a protester in DC, said, referring to the US president's campaign slogan.
""It appeals to his base. He is really trying to whitewash the country.""
Enriquez told Al Jazeera that undocumented migrants were ""at the crosshairs of his policy"".
Across the US, the move to separate children at the border has been condemned by activists and some segments of the media.
The San Francisco Chronicle's editorial board wrote that the Trump administration ""has taken an immigration process that was already maddening and added an extra layer of cruelty … the result will be a generation of traumatised and scarred children - and a shame upon our nation.""
Likewise, the Seattle Times' editorial board described the policy as ""the very definition of inhumane"".
In a statement, Efren Olivares, the racial and economic justice director for the Texas Civil Rights Project, accused the Trump administration of taking ""American Exceptionalism to a whole new level: no developed democracy in the world systematically separates children from their parents simply for coming into the country.""
Exel Estrada, 19, from Guatemala, told Al Jazeera that he had come to the US as an undocumented minor in 2013. He was detained for a month before he was able to apply for asylum, the decision of which is still pending.
""I thought it was hard for me. I can't imagine what these children and families are going through.""
The protests come as Trump continues to call for tougher border security amid reports of an increase in undocumented border crossing in April. Immigration rights activists said Trump's continuous vitriol towards immigrants, especially Mexicans, has emboldened border patrol agents, allowing them to intimidate and profile at will.
In 2017, Trump signed an executive order that gave enforcement agencies expanded powers to focus on most undocumented immigrants, including those with no criminal record.

Reluctant to give her full name, the refugee rights activist from Budapest says a measure of self-censorship is necessary to continue her involvement with civil society groups.
""It would be very easy to say I'm not targeted. I'm privileged. I'm white. I'm European. But people are in different situations, and I really feel that we have to think twice if we risk our [refugee] friends,"" says Aliz.
Her caution stems from new legislation, submitted to the Hungarian parliament, that criminalises activities supporting so-called irregular migrants.
Under the proposal, those who distribute food and informational leaflets, or offer legal advice to asylum-seekers could serve jail time.
The UNHCR has asked the Hungarian parliament to withdraw the measure, claiming that it would ""deprive people who are forced to flee their homes of critical aid and services, and further inflame tense public discourse and rising xenophobic attitudes"".
The proposed legislation is the latest in a series of draft bills called ""Stop-Soros"", which aim to curb civil society groups and NGOs working on asylum issues in the country.
The legislative package is named after the Hungarian-American billionaire philanthropist George Soros, who the government accuses of enabling illegal migration into the country.
""Many people feel that it is a risk to raise their voices. I'm not saying that if you say this, for sure you're going to be fired. But it's enough to have some stories of people being fired because of their political opinions,"" says Aliz.
""We cannot act because of these fears, because of self-censorship.""
A high school teacher by profession, Aliz had been collecting and sharing testimonies from asylum-seekers, giving speeches at demonstrations and speaking to the press about the rights of foreigners and migrants in her country.
But in 2017, she was forced to stop her work when the government passed a law that prohibited access to the border.
Asylum seekers were pushed into container camps in highly secure ""transit zones"", a move that garnered strong condemnation from international human rights groups.
Hungary has since constructed a fence on its border with Serbia, allowing just two asylum-seekers into the country a day.
""Everything is connected to migration in the government's discourse,"" says Aron Demeter, a spokesman for Amnesty International Hungary. ""It's the mother excuse to crack down on independent institutions.""
The previous Stop Soros bill included a 25 percent tax on foreign funds received by NGOs working on migration. While the new proposal appears to have dropped this provision, the draft legislation now contains language about punitive measures against activists and individuals helping migrants.
""The government just doesn't want any critical NGOs to exist,"" adds Demeter.
The recent bill is yet another attempt by Prime Minister Viktor Orban to prevent migration to Hungary, which he calls a ""Trojan horse for terrorism"".
Such rhetoric is par the course for Orban, whose ruling party, Fidesz, won a super-majority in last month's parliamentary elections, allowing it to pass constitutional changes and laws without any support from the opposition.
Critics say the campaign was tinged with xenophobia and anti-Semitism; billboards across the country featured a smiling caricature of Soros, in addition to images of a faceless mass of non-white men behind a stop sign, reportedly recycled from Britain's anti-immigrant party, UKIP's ad.
During the campaign, Orban's chief of staff posted a video on Facebook of an immigrant enclave in Vienna, claiming that ""white Christians"" had been pushed out and that Hungary could be next. The video was taken down by Facebook, citing its ban on hate speech, only to be restored as an exception to the company's rules.
Daniel Mikecz, a political analyst at the Republikon Institute, a liberal-leaning think-tank in Budapest, says that focusing on migration has become a winning strategy for the Fidesz government.
""The point is to find conflicts, develop those conflicts where you can have a majority, and migration is such an issue. Most NGOs and civil society groups won't be affected by this law. So the government can say there are some NGOs, some activists, that are working against Hungary's sovereignty,"" Mikecz says.
The issue of migration is also connected to the government's attempt to stave off Hungary's demographic decline. Liberal democracy as Orban recently said, ""has been exhausted"" and ""fails to deliver"".
Orban has instead espoused the virtues of ""Christian democracy"" by promoting traditional families and an increase in the country's birth rate, to defend against refugees described as ""Muslim invaders"".
Currently, Muslims make up 0.4 percent of Hungary's total population.
For activists such as Annastiina Kallius, the debate over migrants and asylum-seekers in Hungary has proven to be broader than it initially seemed. ""It came to the point that in chasing this migration issue, we were a bit like Don Quixote chasing windmills,"" she says.
""This thing is so much bigger than migration. It affects everything - the schools, the courts, the police, the institutions of this country. That's why we have to take a step back and reassess.""

Authorities moved in on Wednesday to clear out as many as 1,500 people, mostly Africans from Eritrea, Sudan and Somalia, from the Millennaire camp in the northeast of the city.
The evacuees, who will now be relocated to 20 shelters across the Paris region, are being moved out of the camp for general welfare and security reasons, French Interior Minister Gerard Collomb said in a statement.
""Police services will be fully committed to preventing such camps being built again,"" Collomb said.
The evacuation was the 34th to take place in the French capital since June 2015, he added.
Al Jazeera's Natacha Butler, reporting from Paris, said the ""peaceful"" clean-up operation, which was still ongoing at noon (10:00 GMT), began at 6am local time (04:00 GMT).
The camp is next to a canal where two migrants drowned earlier this month.
""There were tents all along on both sides of this canal,"" Butler said. ""The conditions were really quite appalling - no sanitation and everyone relied on the kindness of strangers and charities for food handouts.""
Police have cleared out about 28,000 people from Paris camps in the city over the past three years, but many continue to travel to the French capital.
President Emmanuel Macron has pushed a new immigration law - still being debated in parliament - that would speed up the asylum process and lead to increased deportations of people seeking work in France, rather than those fleeing war or persecution at home.
In his statement, Collomb said evacuees who are eligible for asylum would be supported.
About 2,700 undocumented migrants live in the Paris area, according to officials and NGOs.
As millions of refugees and migrants arrived in Europe in recent years after fleeing war and economic devastation, France has welcomed only a fraction of the newcomers.
""This government is really speeding up deportations and detentions of illegal migrants,"" said Butler.
""What it wants is to try and reduce the number of people coming to France and reduce camps like these, which are becoming a very visible symbol of France's immigration problem.""

Some 228 millimetres of rain fell in Maubin in the 24 hours ending at about 00:00 GMT on Tuesday, and 77mm fell in Yangon.
The circulation may make landfall before it has time to be classified as a cyclone, but the rain will continue regardless.
The main focus of the rain will transfer northeastwards across the country, but in its wake, there will be further heavy and prolonged showers.
This may mark the real onset of the monsoon across Bangladesh and Myanmar. Rainfall across the region doubles between May and June.
Flooding from monsoon rain causes scores of deaths each monsoon season. As recently as 2015, 100 people died in the floods, and in 2016 more than 400,000 people were displaced by floodwaters.
The heaviest of the rain is not expected to affect the Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh in the immediate future. For the hundreds of thousands of Rohingya who have fled Myanmar to Bangladesh, the monsoon season is a particularly worrying time.
The camps are often in the most flood-prone areas, and flimsy plastic sheeting and tents are vulnerable, both to heavy rain and strong winds.
In recent weeks, the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) has been supporting Bangladesh's largest non-governmental organisation BRAC in the training of 20,000 community outreach members in emergency preparedness.
""As heavy rains and strong monsoon winds approach, it is critical that we stand firmly with the Rohingya refugees we serve,"" said Kevin J Allen, UNHCR Head of Operations based in Cox's Bazar.
""It is equally important that we empower and train refugees to play their role in the response, working hand-in-hand with the national authorities, sister UN agencies and civil society.""

The Palestinian Journalists' Syndicate (PJS) said in a statement on Saturday that the bill would ""grant legitimacy to the Israeli occupation to commit more crimes.""
""[The bill] severely attacks the profession of the press and legitimises the criminal practices committed by the Israeli occupation army against Palestinian people.
""It is an attempt to escape punishment and international justice,"" the statement added.
The bill was proposed to the Knesset, Israel's parliament, on Thursday and has been backed by Defence Minister Avigdor Lieberman.
The proposed legislation, entitled the ""Prohibition against photographing and documenting [Israeli army] soldiers"", criminalises photographing troops on duty.
""Anyone who filmed, photographed, and/or recorded soldiers in the course of their duties, with the intention of undermining the spirit of [Israeli army] soldiers and residents of Israel, shall be liable to five years imprisonment,"" says the bill, proposed by Robert Ilatov, a member of the Knesset and the chairman of the right-wing Yisrael Beiteinu party.
The bill's explanatory notes said that Israel had ""witnessed a worrying phenomenon of documentation of Israeli soldiers"" for many years.
""This was done through video, stills, and audio recordings by anti-Israel and pro-Palestinian organisations such as B'Tselem, Machsom Watch Women, Breaking the Silence, and various BDS organisations.""
Ilatov said that it was time to end ""this absurdity"".
""We have a responsibility to provide Israeli soldiers with optimal conditions for carrying out their duties, without having to worry about a leftist or organisation who might publish their picture to shame and disgrace them,"" he said.
The bill was also criticised by the liberal Israeli Haaretz daily, which, in an editorial published Sunday, described it as causing ""serious harm to freedom of the press and the public's right to know.""
""The public has a right to know what the reality is and especially what the 'people's army' is doing in its name and on its behalf,"" the editorial said.
""That is why censorship can only be exercised in cases of serious danger to state security and not in an effort to head off criticism of the army.""
The PJS argued that if the bill is approved, it will grant legitimacy to the Israeli occupation to commit more crimes.
The group called on the United Nations and international press freedom institutions to ""exert pressure on the occupying entity to comply with international laws and conventions, and to protect the freedom of press to document the truth.""

Spain's maritime rescue service said it pulled 243 people from eight small boats on Sunday, a day after picking 293 others from nine vessels.
Three of the boats located on Sunday were in poor condition and sank shortly after those on board were removed from them.
The operations included plane and helicopter searches, while those rescued were from various countries in north and sub-Saharan Africa.
At least 6,872 people have been rescued while trying to enter Spain by sea so far this year, according to the International Organization for Migration (IOM), while 218 others have died attempting to make the crossing from North Africa, known as the Western Mediterranean route.
While the number of refugees and migrants arriving in southern Europe by sea has dropped substantially since the height of the European Union's (EU) refugee crisis in 2016, the number of such arrivals in Spain has jumped during the same period, according to the IOM.
At least 21,468 arrived in Spain by sea between January 1 and December 20 last year, IOM figures show, more than triple the number for the same period in 2016.
Spain is the third busiest point of arrival for all refugees and migrants entering Europe by sea, behind Italy and Greece, accounting for 23 percent of all such arrivals to the EU.
Increasingly, it is seen as an alternative arrival destination for those seeking to avoid travelling through Libya, where widespread abuse and slavery has been documented, and onwards across the Mediterranean to southern Italy.
In separate comments on Sunday, Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz called for EU border agency Frontex to be given a new mandate allowing it to act in ""third countries with the agreement of local government"".
Kurz told Germany's Welt am Sonntag newspaper that more must be done ""to end smugglers' dirty business model and prevent smugglers' boats setting off on the dangerous route across the Mediterranean"".
Austria is set to take over the presidency of the EU, which rotates among member states every six months, in July.
Kurz is known for his anti-immigration stance and has previously called for stricter border controls in Europe to discourage refugees from fleeing to Europe

An estimated 20,000 counter-demonstrators, including anti-fascists, pro-refugee organisations and LGBTQI groups, took to the streets of Berlin, shouting slogans against the AfD rally, which saw party leaders addressing a crowd of about 5,000.
""Many times during the speeches by AfD leaders you couldn't hear what they were saying because they [counter-demonstrators] were playing loud band music and chanting 'Nazis out',"" said Al Jazeera's David Chater, reporting from Berlin.
He added that about 2,000 police officers had been deployed ""to make sure there was no trouble"".
""In the end, it was a vocal confrontation rather than a violent one,"" Chater said.
All about the base. Hundreds of counter-demonstrators already gathering in Berlin near to the capital’s Victory Column. Dozens of clubs, theatres and rights groups from across Berlin will later march against far-right AfD. Say they want to “bass away the AfD”#AfDwegbassen pic.twitter.com/ufo0EHfl4b
Founded in 2013, the AfD became the first far-right party to enter Germany's Bundestag in decades after securing more than 12 percent in last September's elections on the back of a largely anti-refugee and anti-Islam agenda.
The AfD called the rally in response to German Chancellor Angela Merkel's migration policy and other grievances.
""Parallel (to parliament), we take to the streets and give our members and supporters the chance to actively participate,"" AfD organiser Guido Reil said at a press conference ahead of Sunday's event, as reported by Deutsche Welle.
""That's very important,"" he added. ""Because we're alternative. It's a new concept.""
Before the rally, Stoppt den Hass (Stop the Hate), an umbrella of anti-AfD protest groups, had said in a statement that it intended to block the far-right march from reaching its final destination.
""The AfD blames Muslims and displaced people for all evils, from poverty to sexual violence,"" Stoppt den Hass said on its website.
The rise of Germany's far right has coincided with a spike in anti-Semitism and attacks targeting refugee accommodations throughout the country.
In early May, a senior government official, Felix Klein, accused the AfD of creating a political environment in which anti-Semitism is tolerated.
""I don't want to say the AfD is anti-Semitic, per se, but it tolerates representatives who are demanding a new policy of remembrance,"" Klein told news website watson.de at the time.
""They initiated this discussion about drawing a line (under the Holocaust), and that is very dangerous because it helps make anti-Semitism presentable again.""
German authorities documented more than 3,500 attacks on refugees and their accommodations in 2016, and another 2,219 were recorded in 2017.
Although the AfD was initially founded as a Eurosceptic party, it was only able to break the five-percent threshold to enter the Bundestag after shifting its focus to migration and Islam.
Al Jazeera's Chater said the party had caused a ""real impact"" in German politics, particularly in the Bundestag, where the party holds 92 seats.
""It is the first time since World War II that we are beginning to hear racist, anti-Semitic, xenophobic and anti-Islamic comments, not only in the parliament but of course during these rallies on the streets of Berlin, and that is what has incensed these counter-protesters,"" Chater said.
""The whole political complexion of Germany has changed since this party [the AfD] became the main opposition party.""

On Saturday, the anti-fascist group ORMA said that affiliates of the neo-fascist Golden Dawn party attacked them in Perama, an impoverished suburb of Piraeus.
The attack comes amid surging violence, including a brutal attack against the mayor of Greece's second largest city, Thessaloniki.
""We were attacked by Golden Dawn members with crowbars outside of the offices of Saint Nicholas Union,"" ORMA wrote on Facebook, referring to a ship worker union linked to the far-right party.
The post added that the anti-fascists pushed back the attackers. When they went to a police station to file a complaint, ORMA members were arrested, the group said.
In response to the incident, Syriza, the ruling left-wing party, said in a statement that the ""poisons of fascism and racism have no place in Perama or anywhere"" else.
On its website, Golden Dawn, which currently has 16 seats in the Greek parliament, dismissed the allegations as ""ridiculous"".
A Greek police spokesperson was unavailable for comment.
Saturday's attack follows an assault on two Pakistani migrant labourers in an outdoor market in Agioi Anargyroi four days earlier.
Javed Aslam, president of the Union of Immigrant Workers, explained that two men attacked the workers in front of ""dozens of Greeks and others"".
""They were just working, and some people came and [attacked] them,"" Aslam told Al Jazeera by telephone.
""Five people beat them … this is happening during Ramadan,"" he said, referring to the Muslim holy month.
In a statement responding to the attacks, Keerfa, an Athens-based anti-fascist group, has called for a demonstration on Wednesday to ""stop the fascist threat"", which constitutes an attack on ""all of our freedoms"".
On May 19, a group of ultra-nationalist demonstrators pounced on Yiannis Boutaris, the 75-year-old mayor of Thessaloniki, during a flag-lowering ceremony commemorating the killing of Pontic Greeks during World War I.
The assailants kicked Boutaris and hurled bottles at him until he was able to make it to his vehicle and escape from the scene.
Police have arrested at least 12 suspects in relation to that attack, according to the Greek daily Ekathimerini.
In early May, some headstones were smashed in a Jewish cemetery in Athens. Although no one took credit for the vandalism, neo-Nazi groups have claimed credit for similar incidents in the past.
The uptick in far-right violence comes on the heels of a massive increase in hate crimes in 2017, when the number of incidents targeting victims based on their nationality, ethnicity or skin colour nearly tripled, according to police statistics provided to Al Jazeera earlier this year.
Yonous Muhammadi, an Afghan refugee and head of the Athens-based Greek Forum of Refugees, was attacked by Golden Dawn in the past.
""Again, I see that [far-right violence] is getting worse,"" he told Al Jazeera.
""Next year we have elections, and [it seems] the far right is taking advantage of this situation.""
In September 2013, police arrested Golden Dawn's leading cadre after a party member stabbed to death Pavlos Fyssas, an anti-fascist rapper, in the Keratsini area of Piraeus.
Following that attack, 69 Golden Dawn members were put on trial for allegedly operating a criminal organisation.
That trial is slated to end later this year, but has moved slowly.

The administration of US President Donald Trump has taken a tough stance on what it deems to be unlawful crossings of the US-Mexico border and has vowed to prosecute the refugees and migrants who do so.
""If you cross the border unlawfully .. then we will prosecute you,"" Attorney General Jeff Sessions said earlier this month. ""If you're smuggling a child, then we're going to prosecute you, and that child will be separated from you, probably, as required by law,"" he added. ""If you don't want your child separated, then don't bring them across the border illegally. It's not our fault that somebody does that.""
This ""zero-tolerance"" policy is a departure from the previous precedent that placed those detained in immigration proceedings while their asylum claims were examined or deportation proceedings finalised. Families were often kept together in shelters, or released to await their hearings.
As a result of the recent arrests, thousands of children have been separated from parents who have been detained and placed in the care of sponsors, but officials say some 1,500 are unaccounted for, according to figures first reported by The New York Times and Associated Press last month.
The scale of that number has sparked outrage on social media, especially amid reports that some of the children had fallen into the hands of human traffickers.
""This [policy] is without a doubt one of the cruellest, most inhumane decisions President Trump has proposed so far,"" said Democrat legislator Joe Crowley, earlier in May, adding: ""Shame on him and shame on any Republican who doesn’t immediately speak out against it.""
Weeks later, there has been no let-up in anger towards the Trump administration, and many are demanding to know the whereabouts of the unaccounted children.
The Twitter hashtag #WhereAreTheChildren trended in the US overnight on Saturday and drew thousands of tweets.
""Ripping young children away from their mothers is already beyond horrifying. But having some of the children sold into human trafficking is the greatest injustice this administration has ever done. It is a crime against humanity,"" wrote Dr Eugene Gu, a frequent Trump critic.
Ripping young children away from their mothers is already beyond horrifying. But having some of the children sold into human trafficking is the greatest injustice this administration has ever done. It is a crime against humanity. #WhereAreTheChildren
Author Maggie Smith said: ""My kids are asleep upstairs in their beds. It makes me physically ill to imagine having them pulled from me, going months without seeing them, not knowing if they are safe or even alive. This is, simply, evil.""
My kids are asleep upstairs in their beds. It makes me physically ill to imagine having them pulled from me, going months without seeing them, not knowing if they are safe or even alive. This is, simply, evil. #WhereAreTheChildren
Trump has responded by blaming his Democrat rivals for the ""law"" that he and his officials have themselves introduced and enforced.
""Put pressure on the Democrats to end the horrible law that separates children from there parents once they cross the Border into the U.S. Catch and Release, Lottery and Chain must also go with it and we MUST continue building the WALL! DEMOCRATS ARE PROTECTING MS-13 THUGS,"" the US leader wrote, referring to the predominantly Hispanic street gang.
Put pressure on the Democrats to end the horrible law that separates children from there parents once they cross the Border into the U.S. Catch and Release, Lottery and Chain must also go with it and we MUST continue building the WALL! DEMOCRATS ARE PROTECTING MS-13 THUGS.
There is no evidence to suggest undocumented migrants are more likely to be involved in criminal activity. To the contrary, studies show that they are less likely to the break the law.
Trump has a long track record of fiery rhetoric against immigrants, and his election campaign included a pledge to build a wall across the US-Mexico border and to ban Muslims from entering the US.
He is still looking at ways to finance the former, and a modified version of the latter is being debated at the Supreme Court.

Volunteers call them over, one by one. On a coffee table, Italy's populist politicians look up from the front page of an unread newspaper.
""Italy has changed a lot,"" says Aboud, a 43-year-old Moroccan migrant who is ""trying to obtain a leave"" permit to remain and asks to be identified by his first name only.
He sits on one of the green chairs in the waiting room of Naga, a Milan-based volunteering association that offers free legal and health-care assistance to all migrants, regardless of their administrative status. Aboud used to live in Italy, and has just returned after spending seven years in Morocco. He noticed a difference.
""It's a lot worse for migrants now,"" he says. ""Maybe it was the economic crisis, I don't know, but there are no jobs, no help, and migrants suffer.""
It could get worse before it gets better: Italy will soon have a populist government that has promised a hard line on immigration. There are more than five million legal immigrants in Italy - some eight percent of the population - according to a report by the Institute for the Study of Multiethnicity (ISMU) Foundation, plus some 500,000 migrants without ""leave"" to remain.
""I'm a bit scared of them,"" says Mery Romani, a 50-year-old Peruvian woman who works as a caregiver.
Her dream was to move to London so that her children could get a high-quality education. She has been trying to obtain Italian citizenship - her grandfather was Italian - but she might be forced to go back to Peru just to bring some documents over. And meanwhile, she will lose her leave to remain.
According to Naga President Pietro Massarotto, many others are worried.
""In the last few years, fear and mistrust have increased among the immigrants we help - especially the least protected categories,"" he tells Al Jazeera.
On Wednesday, May 23, Giuseppe Conte was announced as Italy's new prime minister, in a deal between the anti-establishment Five Star Movement (M5S) and the right-wing populist League (formerly campaigning as Northern League) that will send both parties to power.
League leader Salvini, the top candidate for the interior ministry, campaigned on a tough anti-immigration platform. During the election campaign, he vowed to put ""Italians first"" and waged war on ""illegal"" immigrants in his talks.
Before the election, he called Islam a ""threat"", and on another occasion was filmed saying ""we need mass cleansing here in Italy too, street by street, district by district, square by square, with forceful methods, if necessary"".
Salvini capitalised on Italy's seemingly rising anti-immigration sentiment. A YouGov study last month found that Italians thought immigration was the most important issue facing the EU - more important than unemployment. In February, a far-right sympathiser shot and injured six black people in Macerata, in central Italy. In March, a 65-year-old Italian shot and killed Idy Diene, a Senegalese street vendor.
M5S and League have signed a ""contract for government"", a deal on common policy targets for their government. The chapter on immigration features proposals to build more centres to keep immigrants in administrative detention; requesting that all mosques register with the state; demanding that the EU resettles asylum seekers in other countries through a quota system; ""effective policies"" to try and deport ""illegal"" immigrants and to reduce the number of arrivals.
It also proposes a review of the EU's Dublin regulation, which determines that the state through which an asylum seeker enters the EU is the state responsible for their asylum application.
Naga President Massarotto is critical of the contract. ""It doesn't talk about people and rights - only about immigration as a security problem to solve,"" he says.
But most of all, Massarotto says the contract does not address the issues with Italy's immigration system.
""If I had to make a reasonable prediction, I would say nothing will change,"" he says.
The League's press office is yet to respond to Al Jazeera's request for comment on the allegations.
The policies proposed by M5S and League add to an already difficult situation for migrants in Italy.
Ibrahim Kone, a refugee who came from Ivory Coast through the Libyan route in 2011, says he likes living in Italy, but that refugees face dire economic straits. Many refugees he knows in Milan are forced into rough sleeping despite having asylum status, and meanwhile, they are barred from leaving Italy to find a job elsewhere - the Dublin regulation determines that refugees must remain in the country that first took their fingerprints.
""The problem here is that there are no jobs,"" he says. ""In other European countries, when you get documents you can find work, a place to stay. Here, if you have documents [as a refugee] you still have no work and you sleep outside. It's not good.""
Nevertheless, the contract sets out to reduce funds for the asylum and immigration system in order to use them for deportations.
Economic migrants don't have it easier. Many find work with Italian families, often as caregivers or cleaners, but the Italian immigration system makes it difficult for families to sponsor them to remain.
""The Italian immigration system creates illegality,"" says Naga's Massarotto.
He explains that normally, Italy would open the door to economic immigrants with ""flows bills"" and ""sanatorie"" (amnesties), but both methods are clunky.
In recent years, ""flows bills"" have prioritised seasonal workers and already documented migrants, while the last amnesty was passed in September 2012.
This means the economic migrants who arrived after that date - and their employers - have not had many chances to settle their administrative status and have plunged into illegality.
One of them is Claudia, a Brazilian woman in her late thirties who has worked in Italy as a caregiver since 2012. She concedes there are many immigrants in the country, but laments she has never had the chance to get a permanent leave to remain. She knows things might become even more difficult.
""I would like to talk to the person who writes the law,"" she says. ""I don't know if I would be able to talk, because I would cry - I have suffered a lot already. I just want to stop being illegal, have the chance to remain through normal channels.""
After six years in Italy, she worries she might be sent back now. She is in Naga's waiting room, among the green plastic chairs, the silence and the newspaper.
There's also a sign. It reads: ""Dreams come true if we believe in them.""

Speaking to Al Jazeera, Linda Snecker, a spokesperson for the Left Party, explained that the increasing focus on migration ""is really changing the political landscape"" in Sweden.
According to a recent YouGov opinion poll commissioned by the Swedish-language Metro news outlet, the centre-left Social Democrats and the far-right Sweden Democrats are tied at 23 percent.
Another poll, published by the daily Dagens Nyheter, put the Sweden Democrats at 20 percent, with the Social Democrats at 24 percent and the centre-right Sweden Moderates at 23 percent.
While 27,000 people applied for asylum in Sweden in 2017, Immigration Minister Helene Fritzon of the Social Democrats recently said in a press conference that the country should only grant asylum to between 14,000 and 15,000 applicants each year.
In 2015, upwards of 160,000 people applied for asylum in Sweden, according to government statistics.
Fritzon claimed that, despite a significant drop in refugee arrivals since the migration crisis erupted three years ago, the number of people entering the country remains ""significantly higher than [what it should be given] our population share in Europe"".
Her comments come at a time when Swedish Democrats are ramping up anti-migrant rhetoric, according to analysts and political opponents.
""We can really see that the Social Democrats are doing the same thing that is happening all across Europe: Moving from immigration friendly politics to the right-wing,"" Snecker said, arguing that putting a spotlight on refugees and migrants ""emboldens"" the far right.
""Having 27,000 people come to Sweden is not a problem at all ... migration hasn't been the struggle or challenge for society that Sweden Democrats [and other parties] want to show it has been.""
The current government is a coalition of the Social Democrats and the Green Party that enjoys the parliamentary support of the Left Party.
The centre-right Moderates Party, which is currently the largest opposition party, has stated its willingness to negotiate a deal on migration with the Sweden Democrats.
Founded in 1988, the Sweden Democrats first entered the Riksdag, the country's main decision-making body, in 2010.
Several of its members have been accused of fascist sympathies and ties to white supremacist movements.
As a result of the 2014 elections, the Sweden Democrats secured 49 seats in the Riksdag.
Critics worry that it could gain enough votes in the upcoming elections to be part of a governing coalition for the first time.
On its website, Sweden Democrats claim the party does not oppose immigration.
The party's platform argues that immigration ""must be kept at such a level ... that it does not pose a threat to our national identity or to the welfare and security of our country"".
In the past, the Sweden Democrats have been embroiled in controversies over its members' anti-Semitic, racist, homophobic and anti-Roma rhetoric.
Experts say the party shares an ideological space with openly white supremacist and white nationalist groups in Sweden.
Expo, a Stockholm-based hate watchdog, documented 3,660 instances of neo-Nazi activity in 2017, compared with 3,064 the year before.
While a majority of incidents were attributed to the national socialist Nordic Resistance Movement (NRM), several other white supremacist groups were active as well.
Jonathan Leman, a researcher at Expo, explained that there is an overlap between the anti-migrant rhetoric of the Sweden Democrats and white nationalist and white supremacist websites and organisations.
""It's common that many members of Sweden Democrats share, spread and sympathise with various news and propaganda sites connected to white nationalism,"" Leman told Al Jazeera by telephone.
""They both place immigration and minorities at the centre of everything that's 'wrong' with society,"" he said, ""and people who don't agree with them are hostile to Sweden or traitors to Sweden.""
The Left Party's Snecker added: ""Sweden is a social democratic country, and that is changing right now.""
She concluded: ""The tone of the debate is very harsh right now, and it doesn't just impact immigrants; it's also affecting women's rights, children's rights [and] LGBTQI communities.""

""More than 294,000 asylum seekers and refugees from the North of Central America were registered globally as of the end of 2017, an increase of 58 percent from a year earlier,"" UNHCR said in a statement on Tuesday.
""This is 16 times more people than at the end of 2011,"" it added.
""The vast majority of those fleeing El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras are seeking refugee protection to the north in Belize, Mexico, and the United States, or to the south in Costa Rica and Panama.""
The applicants are primarily women or children unaccompanied by or who have become separated from their families.
UNHCR added that despite the risks they face when crossing borders, such as violence, sexual violence or exploitation, these people travel ""out of desperation, facing high levels of homicide in their countries of origin"".
Although Mexico continues to be a country of transit to the United States, more asylum seekers have decided to settle there, UNHCR said.
""Last year we saw the new phenomenon that they are getting closer to Costa Rica, Panama and Belize, and we can no longer consider Mexico as a country of transit, but as a country of destination as well,"" Francesca Fontanini, UNHCR's spokeswoman for America, said on Tuesday.
According to Fontanini the complexity of the problems facing Central American countries meant there is no quick solution.
""For now they can't and they don't want to go to back to their countries,"" Fontanini said.
""We need the states to invest in long-term solutions,"" she added.
UNHCR's comments come less than a month after the administration of US President Donald Trump announced it was ending Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Hondurans. Officials said on May 4 that more than 50,000 Hondurans who hold TPS would have 20 months to leave the US or face deportation.
The administration has also ended TPS for some 200,000 Salvadorans, 2,500 Nicaraguans and 55,000 Haitians.
TPS provides protections for people unable to return to their homes out of safety concerns, usually stemming from natural disasters or wars.
Trump has cracked down on immigration since taking office last year, reiterating his promise to build a wall on the US-Mexico border.
Last month, an annual caravan of migrants and refugees from Central America made international headlines after Trump took to Twitter to criticise what he considers lax border laws.
Hundreds of migrants and refugees made their way from Central America to the US-Mexico border with the intention of seeking asylum in the US. The first of the caravan - eight women and children - were allowed to enter the US on April 30.
As of May 2, at least 88 people from the caravan had crossed into the US.

After Algeria had requested help from the UN to support a huge influx of migrants, the UN on Tuesday urged the Algerian authorities to stop expelling such migrants.
UN spokeswoman Ravina Shamdasani told a regular UN briefing in Geneva that deportations and expulsions have increased since the second half of 2017, and a UN human rights team went to Niger to investigate this month.
""What they heard was that Algerian authorities frequently carry out mass round-ups of sub-Saharan African migrants in various parts of the country,"" Shamdasani said.
According to the UN team's investigation, only one out of 25 migrants had her passport checked before being expelled.
Most of them had been told to put thumbprints on Arabic documents they could not read.
The migrants told the UN team they were not told why they were being detained and were not allowed to retrieve their belongings, passports or money before being expelled.
""Some were taken straight to Niger while others were held in military bases in inhuman and degrading conditions, before being taken south,"" the UN team said citing migrants' statements.
Shamdasani added that some of the migrants were crammed into big trucks to be transferred to the Nigerien border where they were abandoned and left to walk hours in the desert heat to cross the border into Niger.
Hassen Kacimi, a senior official at Algeria's interior ministry, told Reuters on Saturday that Algeria had called for help from the international community, but the UN had done little to assist the migrants.
Kacimi stated that it is Algeria that ""rescues the migrants abandoned in the desert by offering humanitarian aid"".
""Algeria is not responsible for the population of other states,"" Kacimi said. ""So whoever wants to cry over the outgoing migrants just (has) to put their hand in their pocket.""
Algeria, which shares borders with Mali and Niger, spent $20m in the past three years handling an influx of illegal migrants from the Sahel region fleeing war, insecurity or poverty.
Kacimi criticised the lack of assistance from UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR), other African states and The International Organization for Migration (IOM) in tackling this issue.
IOM spokesman Joel Millman, said the UN migration agency, IOM, had rescued about 3,000 migrants in the area in the past four months, including some trying to get into Algeria.
Many migrants said they were dropped as far as 30km from the border in 45C heat, often without water and carrying children.
IOM said it provided shelter for up to 3,500 of the displaced in Niger.
""Migrants were seen losing their lives, often unrecorded or unrecognised in the sand dunes,"" Millman said.

After the announcement of Maduro's election victory, a number of countries, such as Argentina, Spain, Germany, and the United Kingdom characterised the vote as either unfair or illegitimate.
In contrast, Maduro, who will now govern for another six-year term, labelled it as a ""historic day"".
""Never before has a presidential candidate taken 68 percent of the popular vote,"" he said.
US President Donald Trump stepped up the financial pressure banning US citizens from purchasing any debts issued by the government, including debts of state oil company PDVSA.
As the new sanctions kick in, Al Jazeera looks at what is next for Venezuela.
Here is what we know so far:
According to the final results Maduro obtained 5.8 million votes, while his main opponent, Henri Falcon, collected a total of 1.8 million votes.
A total of 8.6 million Venezuelans voted, a turnout of 46.01 percent, which was lower than the projected 48 percent.
Venezuela's opposition claimed a moral victory after boycotting the polls.
The international response was quick; the administration of US President Donald Trump placed tough new sanctions.
Trump signed an executive order imposing new penalties that bar US companies or citizens from buying debts issued by the government and state-run oil company PDVSA.
""This measure is designed to stop the government of Venezuela from mortgaging the country's future, and [to stop] officials lining their own pockets,"" a senior administration official told the Financial Times.
Luis Almagro, secretary-general of the Organization of American States (OAS) did not acknowledge the results and in a video posted on his Twitter account, he said: ""Yesterday was an infamous day for the democracy of the Americas ... we do not recognise him as the legitimate president of Venezuela"".
Russia responded, too, and said ""imposing sanctions on Venezuela will not help resolve the crisis in the country, it also runs counter to international law,"" Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander Pankin told reporters.
In Venezuela, the opposition said it is planning to push for new presidential elections to be held by the end of 2018, National Assembly President Omar Barboza declared.
A possible transition
""As a consequence of Sunday's results, which were not surprising, the government is weaker today ... it's losing the strength that it originally had,"" Ramon Pinango, a Venezuelan sociologist analyst said.
Hours later after the results were announced, many international actors expressed their disapproval. However, other countries recognised the process; among those were Russia, China, Iran, Cuba, Bolivia, El Salvador, and Nicaragua.
""Somewhere in the future [we might experience] a transition of power that will have different stages. It is becoming increasingly costly for the government to stay in power,"" Lobos said, adding:
Since the beginning of the year, there have been at least 19 officers detained in Venezuela, among those are lieutenant colonels, some of whom commanded important battalions, according to local reports.
Humanitarian crisis
""It seems all estimations were fulfilled. We have a strong victory of Maduro with 68 percent of the popular vote, however, the margin of abstention is [high]. The result is legal, nobody can question this, but there is a legitimacy crisis ..."" Javier Buenrostro, a professor at the National Autonomous University of Mexico said.
""Economic sanctions have been imposed and I believe people are the ones to be affected the most, while the sanctions will push the economy, other crisis will start to radicalise, among those the refugee crisis, [problems with food], and the crisis in hospitals,"" Buenrostro said.
""I suspect that this situation won't be resolved within the country but it's more likely to be resolved as a humanitarian crisis, and outside Venezuela with international actors,"" Buenrostro added.

Videos on social media appeared to show buses entering Yarmouk camp after midnight on Sunday to transport fighters and their families out of the area.
Syrian state media, however, denied that there was a deal between ISIL and the government.
The suburb of Damascus has seen the most intense bombardment by the Syrian army during the past four weeks.
ISIL fighters remained there after other armed groups around the capital left.
Before the war, Yarmouk camp was home to one of the most prosperous Palestinian refugee communities in the Middle East.
Now it's a heap of rubble, with its former residents scattered across the region.
The United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) said it was overwhelmed by the size of the humanitarian disaster.
""The people have simply fled,"" Christopher Gunness, spokesperson for UNRWA, told Al Jazeera from occupied East Jerusalem.
""This pitiful war has extracted an untold price on the people of Yarmouk,"" added Gunness, who visited Syria last week.
He said what was ""one of the most thriving Palestinian refugee camps in the Middle East"" was completely destroyed.
""They [Yarmouk residents] fled through the area of Yalda, which is adjacent to Damascus. They came to our office in Damascus in a traumatised, in a completely bombed-out state, with absolutely nothing,"" he said
""Yarmouk was once a symbol of Palestinian - if you like - prosperity; it was part of their place in the Middle East, one of the largest refugee camps that we had and yet today it lies in utter ruins.""

Horrified by an Israeli assault on the Jenin refugee camp in 2002, Tatian says she stitched a mini American flag on to the Israeli one and flicked red paint on both so that the flags would look drenched in blood.
She says she did it to showcase Israeli brutality and US complicity. Now in her late sixties, she didn't expect to be still carrying it to Palestine protests all these years later.
""That was 16 years ago, and nothing has changed. I have carried this flag for years to protests,"" the soft-spoken Tatian told Al Jazeera during a Palestinian solidarity rally in New York City on Friday. ""And yes, I am tired of carrying this flag, but imagine the Palestinians. It has been 70 years for them, imagine how they must feel,"" she said.
Tatian was one of at least 800 people who descended on Times Square on Friday to join a demonstration organised by the NY4Palestine coalition in solidarity with Palestinians after another week of bloodshed in Gaza.
At least 64 people were killed and a further 2,700 injured when Israeli military opened fire on Monday on tens of thousands of protesters a day before the commemoration of the Nakba, or Catastrophe, when over 700,000 Palestinians were expelled from historical Palestine in 1948. Since the Great March of Return protests began on March 30, the Israeli military has killed 113 people, including 15 children.
At least 12,000 others have been injured, including 3,500 with gunshot wounds.
The carnage on Monday prompted Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein, the UN human rights chief, to describe Israel's response to the protests in Gaza as ""wholly disproportionate"" and call for an investigation.
Noura Farouq, spokesperson for the NY4Palestine coalition that organised the rally in New York City, one of several cities to host solidarity events for Palestinians over the past week - told Al Jazeera they had set up the event ""to commemorate 70 years since the establishment of the state of Israel and the widespread expulsion of Palestinians from their homelands"".
""It was also organised as a response to the [US President Donald] Trump's administration opening of US embassy in Jerusalem,"" Farouq said, referring to the relocation of Washington's diplomatic mission from Tel Aviv, which also took place on Monday.
Fully kitted out with keffiyehs, large Palestinian flags, posters and placards, the crowd that assembled under the dazzling lights of Times Square roared with songs and chants in support of Palestine.
A dozen speakers, community leaders, activists and academics, roused a boisterous crowd by linking the Palestinian struggle to the global fight against capitalism, racism, inequality and injustice.
Shellyne Rodriguez, a teacher and artist, told Al Jazeera that she was at the rally ""to make sure that the Palestine issue would not be made invisible"".
""It is outrageous that colonialism would still exist in 2018; it is long overdue that Palestine is recognised and that their struggle against apartheid is recognised,"" the 40-year-old from the Bronx said. Likewise, Marshall Douglas, a 67-year-old US citizen, said that ""Israel had to be recognised for what it was: a sadistic state"".
""What happened earlier this week shows that Israel wants to close off any form of Palestinian expression. This is grossly unfair. It just has to be rectified,"" Douglas said.
IfNotNow, a Jewish movement that focusses on urging Jewish Americans to withdraw support for Israel's continued occupation of Palestinian territory, also held a vigil on Friday night for the Palestinians killed in Gaza.
The group said in a statement that they were gathering to ""mourn the Palestinians killed by the Israeli army and make it clear that the future of the Jewish community rejects Israel's horrific, deadly violence and the further entrenchment of the Occupation"".
While outrage and demands for accountability over the killings in Gaza continued to grow, there were others who came out to show support for Israel, describing the killings as self-defence.
Across the picket line from Friday's rally in solidarity with the Palestinians on 42nd Street and Broadway, about 20 people held a counter-rally in support of Israel.
Some protesters screamed expletives at the Palestinian supporters, calling the diverse crowd ""Hamas sympathisers"" and ""anti-Semites"". Others screamed ""Jerusalem is Jewish"", ""F*** Palestine"" and ""All of you under the shoe"".
Elise Nahum, 47, who described herself as a ""Puerto Rican Jew"", claimed that most at the Palestinian rally were paid to be there. ""It's always the same people who come to protest against Israel,"" she told Al Jazeera.
""And look, we are not looking for trouble. Trump kept his promise to move the embassy and did it. We want to live in peace, and there are Arabs and Israelis who live in peace in Israel. These [here] are just troublemakers,"" Nahum said.
Another protester, Ariel Kohane, 47, holding a ""Jews for Trump"" poster, said that ""these supporters of Palestine were simply against peace"".
""Israeli soldiers bend over backwards not to hurt anyone. Only as a last resort do Israeli soldiers open fire on Palestinians,"" Nahrum Kohane told Al Jazeera.
Responding to such claims, Douglas shook his head and said that excuses for Israeli soldiers' violent actions were wearing thin.
""They aren't allowed to fight, they aren't allowed to protest peacefully … even if they throw Molotov cocktails, everyone knows it is mostly symbolic; these don't hurt or impact anyone,"" Douglas says.
Looking on at the handful of pro-Israel hecklers trying to disrupt the Palestinian rally, Iris Tatian, clutching her ""bloody"" Israeli flag tightly, says that she feels pity for protesters across the road, ""on the wrong side of history"".
""They are uninformed and therefore fearful. They have been sold the Israeli narrative of victimhood. And in the end, they are just doing what was done to them,"" Tatian says.

A rally in support of refugees and migrants will be held on Saturday at Roxham Road, a popular crossing point on the border, to welcome asylum seekers into the country.
Between January and April this year, more than 7,300 asylum seekers walked across the border into Quebec province without visas.
""We believe that Quebec and Canada should be welcoming places for asylum seekers and that we have the resources to welcome them properly,"" said Aaron Lakoff, from the group Solidarity Across Borders, at a press conference on Wednesday in Montreal.
Lakoff said Saturday's rally also aims to prevent members of a far-right group from intimidating newcomers at the border.
Calling itself an ""ultra-nationalist"" group, Storm Alliance has been active in Quebec since 2016 and purports to have about 3,000 members, according to information put out by anti-fascist activists in Montreal.
The group, which publicly says it doesn't have ties to the far-right, plans to hold its own protest against the irregular entry of asylum seekers into Canada near the border on Saturday as well.
""We consider Storm Alliance to be a racist, far-right group… [They] will try to go to Roxham Road to sow fear and hatred against refugees,"" Lakoff said.
""We will be there, at Roxham Road, with a clear message to say that we want to open the border and that refugees are welcome.""
There has been an increase in the number of asylum seekers irregularly crossing the border into Quebec since last year.
A bilateral agreement between the United States and Canada makes it impossible for asylum seekers who are already in the US to apply for asylum in Canada at an official port of entry.
But a loophole in that deal, known as the Safe Third Country Agreement (STCA), gives asylum seekers the right to have their refugee claim assessed if they are already on Canadian soil.
As a result, thousands of people have walked across the border into Canada since early 2017, nearly all of them immediately telling Canadian officials they wanted to apply for refugee status.
The asylum seekers can stay in Canada while their refugee claim is being processed.
""The Safe Third Country Agreement is dangerous; it has actually caused the loss of peoples' lives,"" said Robyn Maynard, a writer and activist based in Montreal, at Wednesday's press conference.
Mavis Otuteye, a Ghanaian citizen, died of hypothermia as she attempted to cross the border into Canada in the winter of 2017. Other asylum seekers have lost fingers to frostbite as they trudged through the snow to get over the border.
Maynard said the crisis isn't that people are crossing borders; the crisis is the human rights abuses that asylum seekers experience, including unjust detention and deportation.
""This is the crisis of our time. This is the great injustice of our time, and it's very important for Canadians and the Canadian government to recognise this and to act,"" she said.
Last year, Canada's federal police, the RCMP, intercepted 20,593 asylum seekers walking across the border without visas, 91.5 percent had entered the country in the French-speaking province of Quebec.
In April alone, the RCMP stopped 2,479 asylum seekers who crossed the border into Quebec irregularly. That's a 269 percent increase from the same month last year when 672 RCMP interceptions were recorded in the province.
Amid reports the Canadian government sought to amend the agreement, Ottawa said earlier this month it has raised ""concerns"" with the US about the situation at the border ""given what Canada perceives as challenges with the STCA in a modern environment"".
The dual rallies at the border will be held amid renewed fears the border crossings could stoke anti-immigrant sentiment in the country.
Experts also say there has been an uptick in far-right groups operating in Canada.
In its 2017 public report on the threat of ""terrorism in Canada"", Public Safety Canada said right-wing ""extremism"" is ""a growing concern"".
While right-wing violence has been ""sporadic and opportunistic"", the deadly attack at a Quebec City mosque in January 2017 ""is a reminder that attacks perpetrated by those who espouse extreme right-wing views can occur"", the report said.
Earlier this month, a group of researchers, journalists and other experts launched a new group to document and counter the rise of far-right hate groups in Canada. Between 120 and 130 such groups currently operate in the country, one expert said.
This isn't the first time Storm Alliance has organised a protest at the border. A similar rally against asylum seekers crossing into Quebec was held last September.
About 300 members of the group showed up on the Canadian side of the border, media reports said. Many wore sunglasses, caps and bandanas over their faces and waved Quebec flags.
Members of La Meute, an anti-Muslim, far-right group that also operates in Quebec, were also on hand.
They were met by a smaller contingent of anti-fascist activists, and the border was closed for several hours as police sought to keep the two groups apart.
Lakoff said known neo-Nazis participated in the earlier Storm Alliance protest.
This time, he said, he expected a few hundred anti-racist activists to be there to counter the group.
""We're going to take the space to make sure that Storm Alliance does not get to go to the border with their racist and hateful message,"" Lakoff said.
""We believe that Quebec and Canada are welcoming societies where refugees are welcome. We will be there with that message. I can't say what they will do on their side, but for us, these are dangerous groups.""

Lempicka would be celebrating her birthday on May 16. In her honour, Google is changing its logo in 14 countries.
This is her story:
Born Maria Gorska in Warsaw, Poland, in 1898, Lempicka's love for art started at an early stage.
As a young child, in 1911, she spent a summer in Italy with her grandmother, who inspired her love for great Italian Renaissance painters, which would define the rest of her life.
The same year, the Russian Revolution started. Her husband was arrested in the middle of the night by the Bolsheviks.
The artist arrived in Paris at the height of post-cubism. In Paris, she reinvented herself as ""Tamara de Lempicka"" a name that had direct aristocratic pretensions.
The artist was a refugee in the city, her daughter Kizette was born in Paris, adding to their financial burden, and making Tamara determined to make money from her art.
She began her formal art training under French painters Maurice Denis and Andre Lhote.
Lhote was her most influential mentor as his style - often referred to as ""soft cubism"" - is detectable in Lempicka's style.
She became prominent in Paris' bohemian art scene, her paintings merging late cubist and neoclassical techniques to create a metal-like visual style that was her own.
""My goal is never to copy,"" Lempicka reportedly said. Instead, she sought to ""create a new style, clear luminous colours"".
Lempicka
By the mid-1920s, Lempicka's portraits were being exhibited in Paris salons.
In 1927 Lempicka painted one of her best-known works: Autoportrait (Lempicka in a green Bugatti), for the cover of German fashion magazine Die Dame.
In the same year, she received her first prize at the Exposition Internationale des Beaux-Arts for the painting Kizette on the Balcony, a portrait of her daughter.
She placed a high value on working, famously saying: ""There are no miracles, there is only what you make.""

In 1943 she moved to New York City. By then her style had become somewhat passe, and as a result, her work wasn't in as much demand as it had been before.
Following the baron's death, the artist sold many of her possessions and made three around-the-world trips by ship.
By then, she was repainting her early works; the last work she did was the fourth copy of her painting of St Anthony.

In 1948 hundreds of thousands of Palestinians were driven from their homes by Zionist gangs who wanted to establish the state of Israel.
In 1967, a war between Israel and Arab countries resulted in the occupation of even more of historical Palestine and the displacement of thousands more Palestinian refugees.
The descendants of these two waves of refugees number in the millions today, continue to live in squalor in refugee camps around the Arab world.
But the roots of the conflict predate the UN mandate which led to the creation of Israel in 1948:
1915, Hussein-McMahon: Sharif Hussein bin Ali, ruler of Mecca and the Hejaz, and Sir Henry McMahon, the British high commissioner in Egypt, exchanged pivotal letters about the future political status of the Arab lands, with Britain aiming to encourage an armed revolt against Ottoman rule.
In one such letter, McMahon wrote: ""Great Britain is prepared to recognise and uphold the independence of the Arabs in all the regions lying within the frontiers proposed by the Sharif of Mecca.""
May 16, 1916, Sykes-Picot: Britain and France signed a secret agreement outlining their spheres of control in the Middle East after the first world war, in which Palestine was designated for international administration pending consultations with Russia and other powers.
The agreement was eventually made public and was seen by Arabs as a betrayal of the Hussein-McMahon correspondence.
November 2, 1917, the Balfour Declaration: Arthur James Balfour, Britain's foreign secretary, sent a letter to Lord Rothschild, president of the Zionist Federation, stating the government's support for the establishment of ""a national home for the Jewish people"" in Palestine, an area that today includes Israel, the West Bank, and the Gaza Strip.
1921, the Arab kingdoms: In the aftermath of World War I, the sons of Hussein were made the kings of Transjordan (later Jordan) and Iraq.
July 24, 1922, the British Mandate: The League of Nations gives Britain a mandate to administer Palestine, while Britain expresses its interest in Zionism and describes its intention to develop a Jewish state.
1929 clashes: Hundreds of Arabs and Jews died in clashes that erupted in Jerusalem and Hebron over the status of key religious sites.
1930s Jewish immigration: About 250,000 Jews arrive in Palestine during this period, in large part because of the rise of anti-Semitism in Europe.
1936-39, the Arab Revolt: Palestinians revolt to protest against the British governance that encouraged open-ended Jewish immigration amid increasing economic hardships faced by Palestinian workers. A general strike was declared, led by Hajj Amin al-Husseini, as well as a boycott of Jewish goods. More than 5,000 Arabs are killed, mostly by the British. Several hundred Jews are killed by Arabs.
November 29, 1947, the partition plan: On November 29, the United Nations General Assembly passed a partition plan dividing Mandate Palestine into two states.
At the time, Jews owned only six percent of the land, but the Jewish state was to receive 56 percent of Mandate Palestine, an area with a population of 498,000 Jews and 407,000 Arabs, according to a UN report at the time.
The Arab state was to have 725,000 Arabs and 10,000 Jews. It was accepted by the Jewish leadership but rejected by the Arabs. Up to 800,000 Palestinians are forcibly expelled from their homes in the part of the land that becomes the state of Israel.
April 9, 1948: The Deir Yassin massacre: On, more than 100 Palestinian residents of the Jerusalem village of Deir Yassin, mainly women, old people and children, were killed by members of the Irgun and Stern Gang Zionist militias.
May 14, 1948: General Alan Cunningham, the last British high commissioner, left what was known then as the Mandate of Palestine.
May 15, 1948: Al-Nakba: The declaration of Israel as the Jewish state took place.
May 16, 1948, the Arab-Israeli war: Egypt, Syria, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Lebanon declared war on the new state of Israel. The poorly organised forces of Egypt, Syria, Lebanon, Iraq and Jordan suffered a humiliating defeat at the hands of the Israeli military, which was a combination of Jewish militias, such as the right-wing Irgun Tzvei Le'umi and the more extreme Stern Gang.
April 1949: Israel and Arab states agreed to an armistice in April 1949, Israel taking control of about 50 percent more land than was originally allotted to it by the UN partition plan.
October 29, 1956, the second Arab-Israeli war, also known as the Suez War, broke out when Israel, Great Britain and France launched a joint attack against Egypt aimed at instituting a 'regime change' and deposing Gamal Abdel Nasser, the country's charismatic leader.
But it failed to achieve its goals and marked the decline of Britain's colonial powers in the Middle East.
October 1959, the Fatah movement: The Fatah movement began of the Fatah movement in Syria, Lebanon, Jordan and the Gulf Arab states.
The movement aimed to unite Palestinians and undertake armed resistance to ""liberate Palestine"". Fatah would later become the main faction within the PLO.
May 1964, Palestine Liberation Organisation: The Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) was founded in Cairo by the Arab League.
March 8, 1969, the War of Attrition: War is declared in March of 1969 by Gamal Abdel Nasser of Egypt, with the aim of launching sustained attacks on Israel to dislodge it from the Sinai peninsula, which it had taken in the Six Day War.
The aim was not achieved and a cease-fire was signed in August of 1970.
February 2, 1969: Yasser Arafat is appointed chairman of the PLO. The organisation operates out of Jordan, developing into what some call ""a state within a state"" and launching attacks against Israel from Jordan.
Black September, 1970: A month-long battle between Palestinian groups in Jordan, such as Fatah and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), and the forces of Jordanian King Hussein Bin Talal.
Martial law was declared by the king, and his forces fought the Palestinian forces that many felt were becoming too entrenched in Jordan. The end result was the PLO being driven out of Jordan and moving to Lebanon.
September 5, 1972: A splinter group that had broken off from Fatah and called itself Black September killed 11 members of the Israeli Olympic team and one German police officer at the Munich Olympics.
October 6, 1973, the October War: In a surprise attack on the Jewish Day of Atonement, Egypt and Syria retake the areas in Sinai and the Golan Heights that were lost in the Six Day War. Despite initial gains, they are soon forced to retreat by Israeli forces.
November 13, 1974, Arafat's speech: Yasser Arafat makes his first appearance before the UN General Assembly, delivering his ""olive branch and freedom fighter's gun"" speech.
November 22, 1974: The PLO is granted observer status at the UN.
March 26, 1979: A peace deal is signed between Egypt and Israel. Egypt becomes the first Arab country to recognise Israel. Later in the year, the Arab League suspends Egypt's membership of the league and moves its headquarters to Tunis.
June 6, 1982: Israel launches a six-month invasion of Lebanon to remove PLO fighters it said were threatening its border. The PLO relocates to Tunis, and maintains only limited activity in Lebanon.
August 1983: The Israeli army withdraws from most of Lebanon, maintaining a self-proclaimed ""security zone"" in the south.
October 1985, Israel's Operation Wooden Leg: An attempt to assassinate Arafat is launched with an air raid on his headquarters in Tunis. He survives, but 60 members of the PLO are killed, including much of the leadership.
Sheikh Ahmed Yassin creates Hamas from the Gaza wing of the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood. It pursues an armed struggle against Israel with the aim of liberating historic Palestine. It also provides social welfare programmes to Palestinian victims of the Israeli occupation.
Hamas defines itself as a ""Palestinian Islamic national liberation and resistance movement"", using Islam as its frame of reference.
August 1990, the invasion of Kuwait: The PLO supported Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. Kuwait responded by severing ties with the PLO and cutting its financial backing. After Iraqi forces are defeated, Kuwait expels some 400,000 Palestinians who had been living in the emirate.
October 26, 1994: Israel and Jordan sign a peace treaty ending 45 years of hostility. Israel agrees to recognise the special role of Jordan over Muslim holy sites in Jerusalem.
July 2000: The Camp David summit between Ehud Barak, Israel's prime minister, and Arafat, the chairman of the Palestinian Authority, aimed at reaching a ""final status"" agreement. It ended after Arafat refused to accept a proposal drafted by US and Israeli negotiators.

January, 2008: Israel steps up military actions on Gaza and Hamas, killing seven Palestinians. Olmert vows to hit back after Hamas rocket attacks in Israel. Israel continues powerful incursion on Gaza, leaving Palestinians in a humanitarian crisis without fuel, power, food and water.
On January 22, Palestinians blow up part of the border at Rafah, going into Egypt. The border breach came several days after Israel had imposed a complete blockade on Gaza, with Egyptian backing, in response to a rocket barrage from Gaza on Israeli border towns.
Ismail Haniya, Hamas leader and one-time prime minister, has meanwhile said the group would not allow the border to be resealed.
The border crossing had been opened on the orders of Hosni Mubarak, the Egyptian president. It had allowed Palestinians trapped in Gaza to purchase necessities that were unavailable due to the Israeli blockade.

May 2013: the Palestinian Hamas movement rejected a revised Middle East peace initiative put forward by the Arab League, saying outsiders cannot decide the fate of the Palestinians. The initiative stated that Israel and the Palestinians could trade land rather than conform exactly to their 1967 borders.
The United States and the Palestinian leadership in the occupied West Bank praised the move. But senior Hamas official Ismail Haniyeh said it was a concession that other Arabs were not authorised to make.
""The so-called new Arab initiative is rejected by our people, by our nation and no one can accept it,"" Haniyeh, prime minister of the Hamas government in the coastal enclave, said.
July - August 2014: Israel launched its offensive on the Gaza Strip, resulting in the death of 2,314 Palestinians and 17,125 injuries. Most of the attacks took place following the abduction and murder of, Mohammed Abu Khdeir, a Palestinian teenager who was burned alive by Israelis in Jerusalem.

Branded an enemy of Hungary's anti-migrant Prime Minister, Viktor Orban, the Hungarian-born Soros has been at the forefront of repeated political attacks against civil society actors that support the rights of migrants in Europe.
The decision to move operations out of Budapest comes as Hungary prepares to impose the so-called ""Stop Soros"" package of legislation, which would enact unprecedented restrictions on human rights groups.
""The government of Hungary has denigrated and misrepresented our work and repressed civil society for the sake of political gain, using tactics unprecedented in the history of the European Union,"" Patrick Gaspard, president of Open Society Foundations (OSF), said in a statement.
""The so-called Stop Soros package of laws is only the latest in a series of such attempts. It has become impossible to protect the security of our operations and our staff in Hungary from arbitrary government interference.""
Though the final law has yet to be made public, government officials have said it would block any incoming organisation from advising or representing asylum seekers without a license.
Soros, 87, is a Jewish financial market guru who survived the Nazi occupation during World War II. Since then he has donated billions of dollars to foundations across the world, with the first in Hungary opening in 1984 to promote freedom of speech during communism.
""This is a very significant moment. The fact that OSF feel the need to leave says a lot about where things are going now with a government that is ruthless when it comes to civil society and has made its intentions very clear,"" said Gauri van Gulik, Amnesty International's Europe director, adding her organisation is considering a similar move if the proposed laws are passed.
""We are going to stand by our colleagues in civil society, but we are taking it day-by-day and if this package passes and are putting our staff at risk in any way then we are going to have to reconsider.""
According to the Open Society Foundations' statement, the closure in Budapest will impact more than 100 staff based there, about 60 percent of whom are Hungarian.
The move has drawn criticism from European Union officials who point to a deteriorating state of democracy in Hungary.
""Whenever a civil society organisation that helps build vibrant & tolerant democracies is threatened & feels it can no longer do its work, democracy suffers,"" EU First Vice President Frans Timmermans tweeted.
Orban and his Fidesz party rode a nationalist and anti-migrant platform to secure two-thirds of the seats in last month's parliamentary elections, securing him a fourth term as prime minister.
Since then, he has declared an end to the liberal democracy that has existed in Hungary since the fall of communism.
Critics say Orban has used his long tenure to systematically eliminate the free media and slide the country towards autocracy.
""Orban is now trying to elevate the conservative revolution in Europe ... and they believe this is going to strengthen Hungary's position in Europe,"" said Balazs Jarabik, a non-resident scholar at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.
With Open Society deciding to leave, Jarabik said Orban has now achieved one of his primary goals of forcing out political foes. ""It is a very unfortunate situation.""

Among the evacuees are rebels and their families, who were in control of Yalda, Babbila and Beit Sahem - towns that have been reclaimed by Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's forces.
The evacuations came in stages after government forces launched a fierce push to retake the area from rebel groups Jaish al-Islam and Hay'et Tahrir al-Sham last month.
Since April 19, government forces backed by Russian fighter jets have also been attempting to push out ISIL fighters from the Palestinian refugee camp of Yarmouk, which has been under siege since 2012.
The towns and the camp lie a few kilometres from central Damascus, where Assad's government resides.
Though evacuations started a few days following the south Damascus offensive, more have been taking place over the past weeks, with rebels groups surrendering pockets across the area.
Under the deal, the opposition agreed to surrender medium to heavy military hardware in exchange for safe passage.
While some convoys headed towards rebel-held Idlib, others were promised entry into al-Bab and Jarablus, which is under the control of Turkish-backed rebels.
""The first three convoys that were headed towards al-Bab made it, but it's the fifth, sixth and part of the seventh one that are being denied entry,"" Majd al-Masry, a Yarmouk-born activist who is among those stuck, told Al Jazeera.
It is unclear why the evacuees are being denied entry, but activists say it may be due to a Turkish-Russian fallout over ""lack of coordination"".
""When we were promised a deal, the Russians apparently did not notify the Turks about our expected arrival,"" al-Masry said.
The convoys, comprising more than 65 buses, are currently held near the last remaining government checkpoint and are receiving some water and canned food from the Syrian Red Crescent, which only operates in government-controlled areas.
""If we move forward, we'd be risking access to the Syrian Red Crescent,"" al-Masry explained.
But the humanitarian situation at the border requires much more, especially amid the current climate shift.
Those stranded have endured rainfall and extreme temperature changes, with heat waves persisting during the day and harsh cold winds during the night.
""We don't even have access to portable restrooms, and diseases began to spread among the women and children particularly,"" al-Masry said. ""We have among us pregnant women in need of medical attention and elderly men who suffer from heart disease.""
The convoys that carried rebels belonging to Jaish al-Islam and other sub-faction groups cannot make their way towards Idlib either.
""These groups with us have been fighting the al-Nusra Front … we can't go to Idlib for that reason – it's too dangerous,"" al-Masry explained.
The Syrian government has since 2015 regained control of the majority of Syria, with opposition groups now restricted to the northern part of the country, namely Idlib province.
It has thus far managed to regain large swaths of land through a series of evacuation deals that usually come amid a military offensive.
Last week, a massive convoy of buses carrying more than 3,000 opposition fighters and their families from the besieged city of Homs successfully arrived in al-Bab. The city was the last remaining rebel stronghold outside Idlib.
Several youth activists among the stranded evacuees have called on the United Nations to facilitate their safe passage but to no avail.
Al Jazeera contacted the UN in Syria but received no response by the time of publication.
""We don't have food, we don't have water, we don't have anything at all,"" Firas al-Tawil, 35, told Al Jazeera.
""The food we carried with us is quickly running out … We call on all sides, the Turkish government, and international organisations to allow us entry,"" he said.
Some have resorted to sleeping in the buses, which are not enough to accommodate everyone at the al-Bab border. Others have laid mattresses on top of the double-decker buses, and some families created makeshift tents using corrugated aluminium panels.
""Are we not human?"" 50-year-old Ala al-Khouli said.
""We endured a seven-year siege, have been displaced several times, and now we can't even get basic rights,"" she told Al Jazeera.
""We do not deserve this,"" the mother of four continued.
The desert-like, barren area lacks even trees that people can temporarily shelter under, one resident explained.
Others wondered how much worse their situation would become in the next few days, especially with the holy month of Ramadan due to start later this week.
""We've been in the same exact clothes for days,"" Ali al-Omar, 29, told Al Jazeera. ""It's just a huge open space with nothing but people all over,"" he said, describing the scene near the border.
Al-Omar fears for his four children, who have only been eating ""canned beans"" for almost a week.
""Only God knows how much more of this we'll be able to take … If I had known, I would have packed blankets for my family,"" he said.
""Why is no one answering us?""

The Justice for Rohingya Minority (JFRM) was launched at a ceremony at Amnesty International's headquarters in London on Wednesday.
Abdulla Faliq, the chief executive officer of JFRM, said the group aims to seek justice for nearly 700,000 Rohingya who fled to Bangladesh following a brutal military crackdown last year by advocating to ""expedite the legal process and pushing the UK government to put pressure"" on Myanmar.
The JFRM, which comprises lawyers, jurists and academics, said it will also collect evidence of alleged war crimes against the Rohingya and take measures to prosecute perpetrators.
It will also push Myanmar to repatriate the Rohingya refugees with full citizenship rights.
The UN has labeled the Myanmar military's offensive against the Rohingya in August 2017 ""ethnic cleansing"", while human rights groups said the campaign of killings, rape and arson amounted to ""war crimes"".
Myanmar denies the allegations, saying it launched a proportionate crackdown after attacks on border posts by a Rohingya armed group.
However, it has blocked UN investigators from accessing affected areas in its Rakhine state.
Mark Farmaner, member of JFRM and director of Burma Campaign UK, argued that the international response to the Rohingya crisis has been muted.
""Nine months on from the start of this crisis, Min Aung Hlaing has paid no price for what he's done,"" Farmaner said, refering to Myanmar's army chief.
""He is emboldened, he has got away with it, and he's now targeting other ethnic groups much more aggressively,"" he said, pointing out to fighting that erupted recently in Myanmar's northern Kachin State.
""It's vital to end his sense of impunity.""
In February, more than 100 British members of parliament called on Boris Johnson, the country's foreign secertary, to back a campaign to refer Myanmar's military leaders to the International Criminal Court (ICC).
Condemning the UK government's response as ""pathetically weak"", Farmaner said London has so far refused to support the ICC call or impose targeted sanctions against Myanmar's army.
Nijam Uddin, a JFRM member and general secretary of the British Rohingya Community UK, said the JRFM was necessary to prevent history from repeating itself.
""World leaders said 'no more' after the Rwandan genocide, but this is happening in the 21st century once again, this time against the Rohingya in Burma,"" the former Rohingya refugee said.
Meanwhile, lawyer Ben Emmerson, who served on the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda and former Yugoslavia, drew parallels between war crimes committed in both countries to those perpetrated against the Rohingya.
""What has happened in Myanmar on the evidence that I have seen so far, rises certainly to the level of the most serious crimes that I saw in the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda,"" he said.
""For the world to sit by and wring its hands and talk about donations to assist the refugee camps is slightly missing the point. This is a humanitarian disaster, and it's time now for action to be taken in order to prevent a recurrence,"" Emmerson said.

Fighting between government forces and regional militia in the Congo's central Kasai province has created a ""perfect storm of poverty, deprivation and conflict for the most vulnerable children"", UNICEF said in a report on Friday.
It called for urgent action to stop the violence against children; ensure access to essential services for all minors; and provide support for sustained humanitarian assistance.
According to the UN, an estimated 1.3 million people in Kasai were forced from their homes after fighting broke out in the region over a power dispute between a local chief and government authorities in August 2016.
UNICEF estimates that as a result of the displacement, which saw thousands of families flee to the countryside without adequate food or water supplies, hundreds of thousands are now facing severe acute malnutrition.
""The good news in Kasai is that the violence has decreased, but what we see there [are] families returning from the bush with children, and they come back in a terrible condition,"" Christophe Boulierac, a spokesperson for UNICEF, told Al Jazeera.
""An estimated 770,000 children suffering from acute malnutrition, 400,000 of whom are suffering from severe acute malnutrition and are on the verge of dying.""
Parts of the Congo, one of the world's poorest nations, has been beset by intercommunal conflict as well as clashes between anti-government fighters and forces loyal to incumbent President Joseph Kabila in recent years.
Since December, at least 70,000 have fled fighting in the country's eastern regions to refugee camps in neighbouring Uganda.
Meanwhile, Kinshasa - the capital - has been rocked by deadly protests demanding Kabila leave office.
The Congo's main opposition parties allege Kabila ""lost all legality and legitimacy"" after failing to step down in 2016, when his last term as president officially ended.
Kabila has said elections for the post, initially set for November 2016, will take place in December.
Boulierac said that despite ""facing several difficulties"", Kabila's government must ""lead"" on the response to the ongoing crisis in Kasai.
""We need to react quickly with our nutritional response ... at UNICEF, we sometimes say children might die if we don't do anything, but in the case of Kasai children are dying, and have already died,"" Boulierac, who visited the region last month, said
""There are 400,000 children whose lives are in danger. It's a real tragedy, and it's already happening.""
UNICEF has called for $88m in aid to address the crisis, saying it has left 3.8 million people in the Kasai region in need of humanitarian assistance.
The organisation is expected to present its report alongside government officials at a press conference in Kinshasa on Saturday.

Human rights and legal aid groups working on the case, presented at a press conference in the Italian capital Rome on Tuesday, allege the Libyan coastguard prevented a ship belonging to non-governmental organisation Sea Watch from completing the rescue of 130 refugees on board a rubber dinghy, putting lives at risk.
Lawyers hope the case will establish Italy's legal responsibility for the incident, and set a precedent to challenge the policy of ""pullback by proxy"" in the Mediterranean Sea.
The policy is the result of various agreements between the Italian government and Libya, already deemed illegal under international law.
The 17 survivors - all of whom are Nigerian nationals - include the parents of two children who died in the incident on November 6, 2017.
Fifteen of them are currently in Italy, while two others are now in Nigeria after opting for a ""voluntary"" repatriation programme from Libya. They are supported by lawyers from the Global Legal Action Network (GLAN), the Association for Juridical Studies on Immigration (ASGI), the Italian non-profit ARCI, and Yale Law School's Lowenstein International Human Rights Clinic.
While policymakers consider Italy's deal with Libya a success for stemming arrivals to the country - which decreased from 181,436 in 2016 to 119,130 in 2017 - data shows the mortality rate has simultaneously increased.
According to the UN's refugee agency UNHCR, one in 14 people attempting the crossing from Libya to Italy has died this year, compared with one in 29 in 2017.
The deal said Italy would provide financial and technical support to the Libyan coastguard, as well as fund detention centres, train Libyan personnel, and support return and readmission programmes to countries of origin for intercepted migrants.
As a result, an estimated 20,000 people have been ""pulled back"" to Libya in 2017, where they face human rights abuses including detention, extortion and forced labour.
""Italy is using the Libyan coastguard to do indirectly what they can't do directly,"" Violeta Moreno-Lax, GLAN's legal adviser and a senior lecturer at Queen Mary, University of London, said on Tuesday.
Videos of the incident, partly coordinated by the Italian Maritime Rescue and Coordination Centre (MRCC) in Rome, show the Libyan vessel - which had been donated by Italy a few months before - pulling the dinghy in a way that could potentially endanger the passengers' lives, while many had already fallen overboard.
The Libyans are later shown beating the migrants and refugees they had taken on board, which is said to have caused panic among those still at sea, leading to the death of five people as they tried to swim towards Sea Watch's vessel.
The Libyan coastguard took 47 of the survivors back to Libya, and two of them were later found to have been sold and tortured.
At the time, the Libyan coastguard blamed the deaths on the NGO. A spokesperson for the coastguard could not immediately be reached by Al Jazeera on Tuesday for comment.
The Forensic Oceanography project at Goldsmiths, University of London, reconstructed the incident using video and audio material, and documented 16 other cases which, the group argued, show a direct correlation between the increasing rate of interception by the Libyan coastguard and the rise in the mortality rate in the Mediterranean.
""The Sea Watch vs Libyan coastguard case is paradigmatic of what we call the Mare Clausum [closed sea] operation,"" Charles Heller, cofounder of Forensic Oceanography, said.
""An undeclared operation launched by Italy with the support of the EU to seal off the Mediterranean. This operation has involved, on the one hand, the criminalisation and sidelining of rescue NGOs, and on the other hand the outsourcing of border control to Libyan actors, in particular, the Libyan coastguard, so that they intercept and pull back migrants on Italy's and the EU's behalf.""
According to Heller, eight of the 13 crew members that operated onboard the Ras Jadir - the Libyan boat which performed the rescue - had been trained by the EU's anti-smuggling operation, EUNAVFOR Med.
""As a result of these policy agreements and multiple forms of support and coordination Italy and the EU have essentially re-established the Libyan coastguard, which was operationally inexistent until the end of 2015,"" said Heller.
He added while in 2016 the Libyan coastguard intercepted less than 10 percent of the boats leaving for Italy, that number rose to 17 percent in 2017, with a peak of 39 percent between August and September - more than any other actor at sea.
Simultaneously, the number of NGOs operating in the Mediterranean has dropped from 10 in 2016 to just three today. Many organisations refused to sign Italy's ""code of conduct"" that included, among other conditions, allowing judicial officers and police on board.
NGOs have also faced legal challenges. Last March, the Spanish NGO ship Open Arms was impounded and two of its crew members were charged with aiding and abetting illegal migration for refusing to hand a group of rescued migrants over to the Libyan coastguard.
The boat was later freed but the confiscation of another boat, the Iuventa, was confirmed by Italy's Supreme Court at the end of April.
According to ASGI, Italy has used $2.9m of its Africa Fund for cooperation for the maintenance of Libyan boats and personnel training. Italy secured another $187m for Libya at the Valletta summit on migration in 2015, $54m of which has gone towards border management, according to Moreno-Lax.
Meanwhile, recent negotiations to reform the Dublin regulation have arrived at a standstill. Responsibility for what happens in the Mediterranean, Moreno-Lax said, rests ultimately on Europe's shoulders.
""Dublin condemns states at Europe's southern border to face the crisis alone,"" Moreno-Lax said.

Heavy downpour on Sunday night killed 15 people in the two provinces while three others were swept away early Sunday in Rubavu district in the Western province, the country's Ministry of Disaster Management and Refugee Affairs (MIDIMAR), said in a statement on Monday.
In Karongi district officials said several residents were missing following mudslides.
The mountainous East African country has been receiving heavy rainfalls since January. More than 200 people have killed and 200 others injured in floods since the start of the year.
Nearly 10,000 homes, 58 roads and seven churches were also destroyed, the ministry said.
Mudslides are common in the rainy season in Rwanda and other East African countries.

Sixty-six buses carrying 3,194 people arrived on Tuesday a day after leaving the town of Rastan, located roughly halfway between Homs and Hama, media reports said.
The evacuation was a part of an agreement reached between several major Free Syrian Army factions and Russia, under which the opposition agreed to surrender medium to heavy military hardware in exchange for safe passage to Idlib province and Jarablus city in northern Syria.
Syria's official SANA news agency announced earlier on Tuesday that rebels handed over most of their heavy weapons, including six tanks and three armoured personnel carriers.
The agreement covers the towns of Rastan, Talbis, Teir-Maale, El-Ganta and Houla, all of which lie 10-15km north of Homs.
The enclave was the last remaining rebel stronghold outside Idlib where much of the opposition has relocated as a result of a series of similar evacuation deals.
Government recapture
The odds have tilted in President Bashar al-Assad's favour ever since Russia intervened and increased its support for government troops in September 2015.
Assad's forces retook the entirety of East Ghouta, outside of the capital Damascus, in April after recapturing the last rebel-controlled town of Douma.
A major military campaign was launched in February with the aim of capturing the last remaining pockets of opposition resistance in Eastern Ghouta.
Analysts say the area's strategic significance stems from its proximity to the capital.
The Eastern Ghouta offensive took a heavy toll on opposition fighters who were subsequently forced into accepting evacuation deals.
In Damascus, Syrian forces pressed further against members of Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL, also known as ISIS) group in a small area south of the city.
Syrian forces have advanced on the ISIL-controlled neighbourhood of Hajar al-Aswad as well as the Palestinian refugee camp of Yarmouk since last month.

Yousef bin Ahmad al-Othaimeen, OIC secretary-general, urged on Sunday the organisation's member states to defend the Rohingya, hundreds of thousands of whom have fled to neighbouring Bangladesh as a result of what the UN has described as a ""textbook example of ethnic cleansing"" by Myanmar's security forces.
""We affirm the commitment of the OIC to continue to act at all international and regional levels in support of the cause of the Rohingya people,"" said al-Othaimeen, speaking at the 45th Session of the OIC's Council of Foreign Ministers n the Bangladeshi capital, Dhaka.
Prior to the two-day OIC summit, a delegation from the 57-member organisation visited Rohingya refugee camps in southern Bangladesh.
Some 670,000 Rohingya have fled Myanmar since security forces launched a violent crackdown in the country's western Rakhine State last August, according to the UN, in the wake of deadly attacks on military posts by members of the Arakan Rohingya Solidarity Army (ARSA).
Since then, Myanmar security forces have been accused of rape, murder, torture and setting Rohingya homes on fire.
""We will [now] play a strong role along with Bangladesh, the United Nations and the international community,"" Hesham Youseff, assistant secretary-general for OIC's humanitarian affairs division, said on Saturday.
He added that the OIC, which bills itself as ""the collective voice of the Muslim world"", regretted not ""responding immediately"" to the situation.
The OIC has said it will create a new committee on accountability for crimes against the Rohingya, in line with its newly adopted ""stronger role"".
The committee will gather evidence of crimes against the Rohingya to ensure those guilty of human rights violations are appropriately convicted, AH Mahmood Ali, Bangladesh's minister of foreign affairs, said on Sunday.
Earlier this month, Britain's ambassador to the UN called on Myanmar authorities to carry out a ""proper investigation"" into alleged crimes against the country's minority Rohingya population.
""In order to have accountability, there must be a proper investigation,"" Karen Pierce said, speaking on May 2 as part of a four-day UN Security Council (UNSC) envoy visit to Myanmar and Bangladesh.
The probe could be carried out either by the International Criminal Court or Myanmar's own government, Pierce added.
Myanmar officials deny the country's military is complicit in instigating violence against the Rohingya, though have pledged to take ""harsh"" action against any perpetrators of sexual violence.
Addressing OIC delegates on Sunday, Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina Wajed urged members to pressure Myanmar into ensuring a safe return for all Rohingya forced to flee their homes.
""The Rohingyas deserve the right to life, dignity and existence like us all,"" Hasina said.
Myanmar and Bangladesh announced a repatriation deal in January, but rights groups and Rohingya have raised concerns about the agreement, saying it does not guarantee full citizenship or safety for those who return.
The UN's refugee agency has said conditions in Myanmar are ""not yet conducive for returns to be safe, dignified and sustainable"".

In 2013, she founded the first women's aviation forum in Lebanon to encourage female participation in the ""very male-dominated world"" of air travel.
Years before, she had already turned down a lucrative job abroad - a decision she described as a ""turning point"".
""I decided to stay to build a better country for my boys to grow up in,"" Itani, a mother of two, said. ""[And] today, we have an opportunity in Lebanon.""
For Itani, a young woman who is not ""represented politically"", that opportunity refers to Lebanon's new electoral law that has enabled tens of women to step forward and run as candidates in Lebanon's parliamentary elections on May 6 - the first after almost a decade of turbulent politics.
Owing to this new legislation, which introduced a female quota, a ""record"" number of 86 women are competing for the country's 128 legislative seats.
""The problems faced by Lebanese women reflect the issues in Lebanon as a whole,"" Itani told Al Jazeera.
Citing the issue of those married to foreign men not being able to pass their nationality to their children or spouses, she stressed the ""need"" for laws that would ""elevate"" the status of women in society.
Itani, who is running as part of the We are Beirut list, belongs to one of largest families in the Lebanese capital.
Her decision to run for parliament, Itani says, was at odds with the stereotypical Beirut-born, male candidates - and this angered some members of her extended family in the lead-up to the vote.
""I faced age and gender discrimination,"" says Itani. ""Many were unable to accept that a female like myself could run outside the traditional sectarian and partisan framework,"" she added.
""They demanded I revoke my candidacy, expecting me to let the elder man win, out of what they describe as 'respect'.""
In Lebanon's political system, the president must be a Maronite Christian, the prime minister a Sunni Muslim and the speaker of parliament a Shia Muslim.
The country's divided parliament has been traditionally dominated by six parties, and according to activists, the fragile balance has allowed a number of people in positions of power to entrench themselves, due to their close ties to large, well-established families.
Currently, there are four women occupying parliamentary seats - all descendants of long-serving male politicians, including Bahia Hariri, the aunt of current Prime Minister Saad Hariri.
""Existing women MPs are here because of their familial ties, not because they are activists,"" Lisa Hamdan, who is also running for parliament, told Al Jazeera.
""As an activist, I am offering a collaboration, between my colleagues and I. We have everything, a solution to all of the country's problems. The problem has always been about implementation,"" adds the 63-year-old, a rights campaigner who was also the communications officer for late Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, who was assassinated in 2005.
""People do want to see new blood.""
Most of Lebanon's political forces were in agreement on the need to reform the previous law - a majoritarian voting system which critics said allowed traditional parties to maintain a monopoly over governance - but disagreed over what system should replace it and how to conduct the elections.
The new law introduced proportional representation, but added complex elements to the voting process. The candidates are spread across 77 lists, with voters first selecting their preferred candidate list, and then their favourite contender from within that list.
The legislation was ratified by Lebanon's parliament in June last year after a long period of wrangling and political instability.
At the time, civil society campaigners said the law fell short of expectations and still benefited well-established powers rather than more independent parties and individuals - a sentiment still echoed today by experts.
""The upcoming elections will not introduce a dramatic change to the prevailing power balance in the country,"" Randa Slim, director of conflict resolution at the Middle East Institute, told Al Jazeera.
""It (the law) also does not do enough about curbing the role money can play in the elections, especially in terms of vote buying.""
According to Hamdan, Lebanon's ""secular"" constitution has been ""wrongly implemented"", leading to several corruption scandals over the years and deepening the country's sectarian divide.
""There is sectarianism in Lebanon because our constitution has been distorted by politicians,"" Hamdan says.
If you have a strong state, strong institutions and an independent judiciary … sectarianism can be defeated,"" she adds.
The mother of four said she spent years working with civil society groups and NGOs, including think-tanks, refugee agencies and development programmes, before realising she needed to form change from ""within"".
Similarly, candidate Nadine Moussa, a lawyer who has been a ""civil society volunteer"" and women's rights advocate for more than 15 years, said activism alone could not effect change.
""I fought for many of people's rights over the years; it's important but fighting is not enough when you want tangible results,"" Moussa told Al Jazeera.
""In order to change, you have to start changing from within the institutions in place … As civil society advocates, the most we can do is present legislation to parliament, but then they tuck away and nothing happens beyond that,"" she says.
In 2012, Moussa decided to launch a grassroots, youth-led secular campaign called ""Take Back Parliament"" to support first-time, independent candidates in advance of scheduled parliamentary elections the following year.
But parliament then extended their term, annulling Moussa's candidacy, as well as that of that of more than 45 new candidates.
""I was certainly crushed,"" says Moussa, a mother of two. ""But I didn't lose hope.""
A year later, at the height of Lebanon's political crisis, Moussa became the first women to run as an independent candidate for president. However, Lebanon would not get a president leading the country's fragile parliament before 2016.
""What pushed me was the will to keep my cause alive, to enable people and let my ideas become the norm,"" says Moussa, whose priorities among the Kuluna Watani list include reforming Lebanon's personal status laws and decentralising public funds.
""I also wanted to break the political monopoly dominated by men,"" she says.
""Most people who usually run don't even have an agenda or programme - they run based on their tribe or sect,"" she adds, referring to Lebanon's 18 religious sects dominating the small country's diverse communities.
For Moussa, the upcoming elections are a ""pivotal moment"" for Lebanon.
""We either go back to the same old system that has been hell, or we advance towards a new path that is far from corruption and everything else,"" she says.
Though many hailed the law as a golden opportunity for activists and women to run against ""typical Lebanese politicians"", experts were quick to play down suggestions that the increase in the number of female candidates was an accomplishment - if anything, it lags behind, they say.
""The spike in the number of women running for the general election is not sudden, because Lebanon hasn't had an election in about 10 years - so we missed a round of elections,"" Carmen Geha, an assistant professor of public administration at the American University of Beirut, told Al Jazeera.
""If you look at the position of these women on the electoral lists, they are often on lists where there are no competitive seats - they are either on minority seats or on seats that will not be affected by the preferential vote,"" she explains.
Compared with other countries in the region, Lebanon ranks as one of the lowest in terms of female representation in parliament - just above Oman, Kuwait and Yemen.
According to Geha, more than 150 NGOs in Lebanon worked over the past few years to mobilise women to run in the elections, but still more needed to be done.
""What's happening in Lebanon isn't a single occurrence, this is the era of the #MeToo campaign … it is also the era of proportional representation,"" she notes.
While women have spent the last 10 years lobbying, advocating and expanding their networks, they have just started to ""scratch the surface"", says Geha.
""Men are still the ones forming the lists; men are the ones heading the lists; men are the ones negotiating the status of women on the lists.
""The sectarian system presents much more difficult issues centred around patriarchy and women's access to decision-making compared to other countries,"" she adds.
According to Geha, the issue of women's effective participation in the country's politics needs to be at the heart of the political debate.
""We need to explore the root causes as to why women don't have a chance in front of the male leader,"" she explained.
""Let's not forget that 40 percent of the lists are still all-male lists … The reason as to why we don't have all-women lists is because their message hasn't been politicised much.""

Earlier this week, Reuters news agency reported that Ottawa is seeking to expand an agreement withWashington to allow it to turn back thousands of asylum seekers at all points along the countries' shared border.
Thousands of migrants have entered Canada irregularly since early last year, cutting across snowy fields or through ditches to apply for asylum.
The possibility that Ottawa will make it tougher on asylum seekers has raised concerns among rights groups and legal experts in Canada, who have long called on the government to suspend the Safe Third Country Agreement (STCA).
""It's not about deepening the reach of the agreement; we think it should be entirely lifted,"" Alex Neve, secretary-general of Amnesty International Canada, told Al Jazeera.
Under the STCA, people can only make a refugee claim in the first country they land in. In other words, a person who is already in the US can't go to an official border crossing to make an application for refugee status in Canada.
A loophole in the deal, however, allows anyone who is already on Canadian soil to file for refugee status. That has pushed thousands of people to enter Canada at unofficial points of entry along the border.
In 2017, Canada's federal police intercepted more than 20,500 asylum seekers walking across the border without visas, 91.5 percent of whom entered in the province of Quebec.
Neve said the deal should be lifted since the US isn't ""a safe partner for refugee protection"", especially under the Donald Trump administration, which he said has dramatically worsened the conditions for refugees and migrants there.
Many of the new arrivals to Canada cited fears of deportation, detention or other human rights abuses in the US as their reason for heading north.
""In many respects, there's an assault on the rights of refugees and migrants under way in the United States,"" Neve said.
""In that context, for the Canadian government to be looking at ways which make it harder and harder for fearful refugees in the United States to look instead to Canada as a place of protection is very worrying.""
Canada has denied it is considering turning the entire border into a point of entry.
A spokesperson for Canada's minister of public safety said that ""would create a 9,000-kilometre issue that would be more difficult to deal with and potentially more dangerous"".
""It would incentivise people to cross at more remote locations and to evade detection by Canadian law enforcement so they can get to an inland immigration office and make a claim there,"" Scott Bardsley told Al Jazeera in an email.
It could also violate Canada's obligations under international law and the STCA itself, Bardsley said.
Meanwhile, an official with the US Department of Homeland Security told Al Jazeera it was ""currently reviewing the proposal made by Canada"" to amend the Safe Third Country Agreement.
DHS has not made a decision on the matter, said the official, who did not respond to questions about what the Canadian proposal entails exactly.
For his part, however, Canada's Minister of Public Safety Ralph Goodale told reporters this week ""no formal proposal"" has been presented to the US.
""There is a conversation about how we make our border - both ways - strong, effective, and secure from the perspective of both countries and that conversation will be ongoing,"" Goodale said.
That was echoed by a spokesperson for Canada's ministry of immigration.
""Given what Canada perceives as challenges with the STCA in a modern environment, and the flows we are seeing at the border, we have raised the matter with the US, and they are aware of our concerns,"" Beatrice Fenelon told Al Jazeera.
Should Canada and the US reopen the Safe Third Country Agreement, Sean Rehaag, a professor at Osgoode Hall Law School at York University in Toronto, said he would expect it to be ""more restrictive, not broader"".
Before the STCA came into force in 2004, about 10,000 asylum seekers would come to Canada from the US every year, Rehaag told Al Jazeera, and make their refugee claims at the border.
About 200 asylum seekers would go in the other direction annually.
Canada had been pushing to get some type of deal in place for years, Rehaag explained, to stem this flow of migrants, and the US only signed on to the STCA once Canada agreed to bolster information sharing with the US after the 9/11 attacks.
Rehaag, who specialises in immigration and refugee law, said he has serious doubts that the US would agree to expand the STCA, given the US president's harsh stance on immigration.
""I just don't think it's realistic to think the US has any incentive to further decrease the number of asylum seekers coming to Canada,"" he said.
Instead, Rehaag said, Canada should lift the agreement altogether and let people make asylum claims in an orderly and safe way at official border crossings - like they did prior to 2004.
""Every country that has tried to close off paths for asylum seekers into the country, the result is not fewer asylums seekers coming in; the result is the asylum seekers come in through more dangerous routes,"" he said.
""Wouldn't we prefer to give them a safe, regular way into the country, instead of pushing them into either irregular crossings, or worse dangerous, surreptitious crossings?""
Whatever Canada decides to do, there are renewed fears the border crossings could stoke anti-immigrant sentiment in the country.
Officials say they expect as many as 400 asylum seekers to cross the border into Quebec every day this summer. Between January 1 and March 31 of this year, 4,828 asylum seekers crossed irregularly into the province, out of 5,052 nationwide.
In Quebec, where a provincial election is set for October 1, some groups are already using the asylum seeker issue to try to score political points.
The leader of the separatist Parti Quebecois, Jean-Francois Lisee, said last month that a fence should be built at an irregular crossing point that has become popular among asylum seekers, Roxham Road.
Quebec, which has borne the majority of the recent influx of asylum seekers, has called on the federal government to provide it with more financial support to help process the new arrivals as they wait for their refugee claims to be heard.
Justin Trudeau's government has also been under pressure to better regulate the border crossings from the opposition Conservative Party, which has argued in favour of making the entire Canada-US border a point of entry to deter the new arrivals.
""The worry that I have ... is the way that this has created xenophobia and divisiveness in the [United] States and in many countries in Europe,"" said Rehaag.
He said the asylum seeker issue is ""completely manageable"" in Canada, but will require political will on the part of the Liberal government to both ""stop forcing people to come irregularly and properly fund the system"".
Properly allocating resources to the entire process - from funding shelters and groups that help asylum seekers find jobs, to appropriately staffing the border and the bodies involved in Canada's refugee status determination process - is critical, Rehaag said.
""It's not the end of the world. The sky's not falling. The numbers are manageable.""
Neve agreed, saying the number of asylum seekers coming to Canada ""is a drop in the bucket"" compared with the hundreds of thousands and even millions of refugees who have sought protection in Turkey, Uganda, Lebanon, Jordan or Bangladesh.
""In that global context, we should be doing everything we can to ensure that we're taking our share of the responsibility,"" Neve said.
""If that means that we will need some increased resources at this time because our southern neighbour is in the midst of a crackdown on the rights of refugees, then so be it.""

In fact, out of the total 976 candidates who originally registered to run, 111 were female candidates - a staggering surge compared to just 12 women in 2009.
The record number has generated a sense of hope in many Lebanese about women's participation in the country's politics, with onlookers commending it as a turning point for women's rights.
Yet as the pool of hopeful candidates dropped down to a final list of 583 people, 22 percent of women dropped out of the race.
For many of the remaining 86 women, the country's political parties and even media institutions seemed not to be yet ready.
According to a study by Maharat, a media monitor tracking Lebanon's election cycle, women are getting much less television air time than their male counterparts.
In the conservative northern district of Akkar, a group of women resorted to creating an all-women's list because local groups ""didn't take the issue of female candidacy seriously"", the group's leader Rola Elmourad was quoted saying.
Catherine Batruni, a researcher who specialises on women's political participation in Lebanese history, said that Lebanon is still lacking a ""solid overarching umbrella movement that galvanizes the masses of women"", and there is a lot of work left to be done.
When it comes to measuring the gender gap, international institutions give Lebanon a nearly failing grade.
According to the 2016 Human Development Report, a report published by the United Nations Development Program (UNDP), female participation in the labor market is 23.5 percent, compared to 70.3 for men.
The country also has a Gender Inequality Index (GII) of 0.381, ranked 83 out of 159 countries in UNDP's 2015 index. The country ranked 137 out of 144 countries on the Global Gender Gap Report 2017, published by the World Economic Forum (WEF), and 142 when it comes to political empowerment.
In concrete terms, these figures reveal a near-total absence of legislation that protects women from abuse of all forms, as well as policies that might facilitate their advancement and equal treatment.
This, despite the abundance of women's groups and non-governmental organizations that are currently active in the country.
In fact, at the very heart of the dilemma of women's rights lies the sectarian makeup of Lebanese politics and policies that patch the country together.
To begin, there are 18 officially recognised religious sects in Lebanon, and there is no civil code that regulates issues of personal and familial status.
Instead, there are 15 distinct ""personal status"" laws, administered by religious courts aligned with the country's diverse communities.
A 2015 report by Human Rights Watch (HRW), surveying 447 recent legal judgments and interviewing tens of people, found that ""across all confessions,"" women faced legal and other obstacles in matters of divorce, pecuniary rights, and child custody, among other issues.
""It's not just that Lebanese women are subordinate to men, or unequal to men; they are unequal amongst each other,"" said Batruni.
""That means that 18 different Lebanese women, from 18 different sects, all have completely different rights and are all being judged in courts [run] by men in a system that favours men.
""We all have different access to divorce, child custody, and inheritance. It's insane.""
Batruni says another example is the discrepancy in some religious courts when it comes to judging men and women, regarding the act of adultery.
It was only in 2011 that Lebanon repealed the criminal code provision, article 562, which mitigated sentences for so-called honor killings, and only in 2017 did parliament scrap a law that allowed rapists to avoid prison by marrying their victims.
Also deterring the advancement of women's rights are provisions over half a century old.
For example, under a 1925 law, Lebanese women married to foreign men cannot pass their nationality to their children or spouses.
Men, on the other hand, can pass their citizenship to their children, wife, or multiples wives.
Lebanese politicians have consistently argued against granting women this right, for fear of shaking up the country's delicate sectarian balance.
Lebanon is home to more than 174,000 Palestinian refugees, according to government figures.
Lebanon also has the world's highest numbers of refugees per capita, due to the civil war in neighbouring Syria. Around 1.5 million Syrians have fled into tiny Lebanon.
Earlier in March, Gebran Bassil, foreign minister, announced he would be proposing a draft law to parliament to remedy the situation, which has been a core issue of the country's women's movement since 2006.
Women married to non-Lebanese men will be allowed to pass on their nationality to their children, except if they are married to men from ""neighboring countries,"" Bassil tweeted. The exception, aimed at Palestinians and Syrians, is to avoid ""naturalization"", he said.
""I would love to know what the Lebanese state's argument was before the Palestinian crisis,"" said Batruni.
""This law has been in place since 1925. There was no Palestinian crisis in 1925.""
Sitting at a feminist cooperative in Beirut, Nadine Moawad, a prominent feminist activist, recounted the time when she spent countless hours taking screen-grabs and recording civil registries of registered voters, which the Lebanese government had released to the public - a traditional practice before each election.
Because women and men vote in separate polling stations, which has apparently been the case since women got their right to vote in 1953, Moawad stumbled upon endless sheets containing women's voter registration data.
She learned that obstacles to Lebanese women's rights extend beyond legislation.
""When you look at the [data for] women, you see incredible diversity in their names, their sects, and in the notes next to their names: ‘She got married; she was removed.' Or, ‘She got divorced; she was moved out of the file',"" Moawad said, describing the sheets of data which have since been removed from government websites and could not be independently verified by Al Jazeera.
Moawad said women are listed by bureaucrats under their fathers' registries. If a woman gets married, her record moves to that of her husband's file.
If a woman gets divorced, her record moves back to that of her father's. Conversely, men fall under a broader ""folder"" of the sects they ascribe to.
""That is when it became clear to me that the problem is not in the individual sect that they ascribe to. It's in the title of the folder. It's in the way that the folder is classified,"" said Moawad.
""It's almost as if in 1905, or I don't know when, the Ottomans had a computer and they created these folders and gave them sectarian names.
""So for example, Shiite_Baalbek: that's the name of the folder,"" she said, referring to a predominately Shia district of Lebanon. ""And now we are not allowed to change the folders' names.""
""And then you understand why women can't pass on their nationality,"" said Moawad.
""It's not only that we're afraid there will be a surge of Muslims who are Sunnis [that will shake up] the demographic balance,"" she said.
It's also because, according to the current bureaucratic system, ""You can only add children of the man or the wives of a man [to his file]. The woman can't add [dependents]. She's actually a plus,"" she explained.
Several Lebanese women who spoke to Al Jazeera expressed a frustration over this issue, including a Beiruti artist who complained about not being able to vote for her own father, who is running for a seat in one of the capital's sub-districts, although she has lived there her entire life.
""I can't even help my community politically, because I have to vote in an area I don't know,"" said the artist, who preferred to remain unnamed, referring to her father's hometown outside of Beirut.
""My mother comes from the south and we have a house in the south. So, even the south is closer to me than where I am actually from on paper.""
Moawad believes that the issue of women voters categorised by their family's sect is one of life and death.
""As long as it's on our registry, someone could kill you because of your sect, or they could appoint you because of your sect, or they could marry you because of your sect,"" she said.
True reform, according to her, would be ""no longer a relationship of families to the state, [but] the relationship of the individuals to the state.""
In the broad view, Batruni noted that the accrued momentum of decades of women's rights activism, both globally and in Lebanon, has resulted in such a high number of women running in this election cycle.
But for Moawad, this is not enough. ""If it's a female, sectarian, hateful MP or if it's a male, sectarian, hateful MP; I have no interest in gender representation.""

According to the relatives, Sakinat Baisultanova - a 31-year-old divorced mother of six children aged three to 10 - disappeared in Cairo on March 12. Family members said they lost her trace since then and they believed she is being detained by the secret police.
Later in March, Baisultanova's former in-laws, Mohamed Aligadjiev and Suad Khapizova, flew from Russia to the Egyptian capital to search for her and to care for her young children.
However, on April 24, armed Egyptian secret police stormed the homes of several Russian community members and arrested Baisultanova's former in-laws; her six children; her sister, Mesedo; two other children and a number of other Russians, according to relatives.
Several family members of the disappeared individuals told Al Jazeera on Tuesday that they were still unable to establish the whereabouts of their loved ones.
Huseyn Baisultanov, a cousin of Baisultanova, told Al Jazeera over the phone from Turkey that he travelled to Cairo in April to search for her and inquire with the Egyptian authorities about her - but to no avail.
He said he checked with police but was not provided with any information.
Al Jazeera was unable to reach the Egyptian authorities for comment on this report.
Sources familiar with this case told Al Jazeera that they suspect Baisultanova might have been targeted because of her ex-husband Ahmed Aligadjiev's alleged ties to armed groups in Russia.
The sources said Aligadjiev was not on the run from anyone and lived a normal life as a refugee in Turkey.
According to the BBC Russian service, Baisultanova moved to Egypt last year with her children but overstayed her visa.
Baisultanova had lived in Turkey's largest city, Istanbul, for several years with her husband before she divorced him three years ago.
The Russian consulate in Egypt told the BBC Russian service: ""We were notified by relatives and we contacted the local authorities and asked for the reasons for the detention of these people and their actual location. Unfortunately, the local authorities have not given us an answer.""
Since the dissolution of the former Soviet Union, thousands of Russian citizens moved to live in Egypt and other countries in the region.
There is an estimated 5,000 Russian citizens living in Egypt today, including many students and small business owners.
A phone call to the Russian embassy in Cairo for comment on this report went unanswered.

Karen Pierce called on Tuesday for the ""root causes"" of the crisis - which has seen hundreds of thousands of Rohingya flee Myanmar for neighbouring Bangladesh as a result of what the UN has described as a ""textbook example of ethnic cleansing"" by government security forces - to be addressed.
""In order to have accountability there must be a proper investigation,"" said Pierce, part of a four-day UN Security Council (UNSC) envoy visit to Myanmar and Bangladesh.
""It doesn't matter whether it is international or domestic, as long as it's credible.""
The probe could be carried out either by the International Criminal Court or Myanmar's own government, Pierce added.
But some questioned the envoys' commitment to justice.
""Accountability of the perpetrators is the most important step, but unfortunately the UN Security Council seems unwilling to apply this to the Burmese military's top brass,"" Kyaw Win, founder of the Burma Human Rights Network, told Al Jazeera.
""Failure of accountability has sent the wrong signals to the perpetrators and now they know that they can get away with it [their actions]. Inaction or ineffective action from the international community risks many lives in Burma,"" he said, using Myanmar's former name.

Some 670,000 Rohingya have fled Myanmar since security forces launched a violent crackdown in the country's western Rakhine state last August, according to the UN, in the wake of deadly attacks on military posts by members of the Arakan Rohingya Solidarity Army (ARSA).
Since then, Myanmar security forces have been accused of rape, murder, torture and setting Rohingya homes on fire.
Government officials have denied the military's complicity in instigating violence against the Rohingya, though pledged on Tuesday to take ""harsh"" action against any perpetrators of sexual violence.
Min Aung Hlaing, commander-in-chief of the Myanmar armed forces, told the Global New Light newspaper on Tuesday the military was ""taking stronger actions against such offenders"".
""Sexual violence [is] considered as despicable ... according to the tradition, culture and religion of the country,"" Hlaing said, adding the government is ready to receive any refugees who wish to return to Myanmar.
De facto leader Aung San Suu Kyi, in her nearly hour-long meeting with the envoys, pledged to investigate any credible accusations of abuse, said diplomats who attended.
Suu Kyi noted Myanmar's difficulties in transitioning to rule of law after decades of military dictatorship, said the diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity.
""She said what had happened or what was alleged to have happened to some of the Rohingya villagers was not acceptable and that if evidence were available it should be reported to the Burmese authorities and they would investigate,"" said Pierce.
Suu Kyi's civilian government has little control over the military.
In February, Bangladesh released a list of more than 8,000 Rohingya for repatriation. As of April 1, not a single person had been returned, despite Myanmar officials having verified the identities of some 600 individuals, according to international rights group Human Rights Watch.
The UN's refugee agency has said conditions in Myanmar are ""not yet conducive for returns to be safe, dignified and sustainable"".
Myanmar and Bangladesh announced a repatriation deal in January, but rights groups and Rohingya have raised concerns about the agreement, saying it does not guarantee full citizenship or safety for those who return.

The official SANA news agency announced on Monday that the fighters and their families, numbering about 5,000, would be evacuated in two stages, the first of which would see 1,500 people transported to the rebel-controlled Idlib province in northwestern Syria.
The deal is part of a wider agreement between HTS, formerly al-Nusra Front, al-Qaeda's affiliate in Syria, and President Bashar al-Assad's government to surrender heavy and medium military hardware.
Al Jazeera's Zeina Khodr, reporting from Beirut in neighbouring Lebanon, said HTS was compelled to accept the government's demands for releasing prisoners and allowing thousands of Syrians from two besieged loyalist towns, Kefraya and Foua, to head to government-controlled territory.
SANA reported that these include 85 prisoners, ""mostly women, children and elderly"", from the rebel-controlled town of Eshtabraq.
""Pro-government forces have long wanted to fully evacuate the predominantly Shia towns because that would deny the rebels the ability to pressure Damascus by threatening to target them,"" our correspondent said.
Buses to transport the rebels and their relatives had already begun gathering around Yarmouk, according to local news media reports.
Al Jazeera's Khodr said this was the fourth such agreement in recent weeks and constituted another important win for government forces and their allies.
""Rebels have already surrendered Eastern Ghouta, which was their main stronghold close to the capital, and a pocket of territory in the Qalamoun region, northeast of Damascus,"" she said.
""In a few days, rebel factions linked to the Free Syrian Army are expected to hand over the districts of Babbila, Beit Sahm and Yalda in southern Damascus in order to stave off a military operation.""
Nevertheless, the agreement falls short of securing for the government control of entire southern Damascus, with a few pockets of territory still under control of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL, also known as ISIS) group.
Government forces have been engaged in a two-week-long offensive to recapture those pockets, but ISIL fighters have put up fierce resistance in areas where heavy weapons have proved to be of limited use.

A statement by the Kurdish-led SDF said on Sunday its fighters mounted a counter-offensive against troops loyal to President Bashar al-Assad, adding they were driven ""far away"" from the villages they had momentarily captured earlier in the day.
Syria's official SANA news agency announced on Sunday that Syrian government forces seized four villages east of the Euphrates River.
A US army statement sent to Reuters news agency confirmed the attack on SDF forces by what it called ""pro-regime forces"" near Deir Az Zor city, and said the ""coalition used established de-confliction channels to de-escalate the situation"", without elaborating.
""The coalition remains committed to our SDF partners in the campaign to defeat Daesh [Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant] in eastern Syria,"" the statement said.
The SDF statement, however, did not specify if the US coalition partook in the military operation. US forces have established a strong presence in eastern Syria, where much of the country's oil and gas reserves are located.
A Western diplomatic source told Reuters that US coalition fighter jets participated in the counter-offensive against the Syrian troops, which included Iran-backed militias operating in the area. This was later confirmed by an SDF source.
The SDF, led by the Kurdish People's Protection Units (YPG), have assumed control of much of the territory east of the Euphrates since its recapture from ISIL.
The two sides have rarely clashed with one another as much of the attention had been directed at defeating ISIL, which dominated much of the area since it declared its caliphate in 2014.
The Russian-backed Syrian army has avoided direct confrontation with SDF forces in its campaign against ISIL and kept away from their areas east of the Euphrates, focusing on regaining territory from ISIL fighters west of the river.
Earlier in February, US air strikes resulted in the death and injury of hundreds of pro-government forces, including Russian defence contractors who were advancing towards one of the largest SDF-controlled gas fields in the city of Deir Az Zor.
SDF forces accuse the Syrian government of attempting to disrupt US attempts to resume an imminent offensive against ISIL in several areas along the Euphrates River that are still under the group's control.
US Defence Secretary Jim Mattis said on Thursday his country was looking to ""re-energise"" efforts against ISIL fighters in eastern Syria in the coming days.
Washington has said in recent days SDF soldiers were returning to the area to launch new operations aimed at defeating the armed group.
Meanwhile, SANA reported on Sunday that a deal had been reached for the evacuation of the Palestinian refugee camp of Yarmouk, where ISIL fighters have been holed up in southern Damascus.
The transfer of ""terrorist groups"" to rebel-held areas of northwestern Syria would begin on Monday, said SANA, without naming ISIL. There was no confirmation from armed groups in the area.
Syrian government forces continue to launch air strikes on ISIL-held pockets in Hajar al-Aswad, one of the neighbourhoods of the besieged Palestinian refugee camp.

Representatives from the 15 member countries of the UN organ on Sunday spoke with some of the 700,000 people who fled what the UN has called ""ethnic cleansing"" in neighbouring Myanmar in a visit aimed at giving representatives a glimpse of the situation firsthand.
At Kutupalong, hundreds of refugees staged a protest. Some carried placards reading ""We want justice"".
Rohingya representatives gave the visiting diplomats a charter with demands, including an international security presence in Rakhine State, repatriation under UN supervision and the restoration of their citizenship in Myanmar, news agency DPA reported.
Russia's ambassador to the UN, Dmitry Polyansky, told reporters that the diplomats would not look away from the crisis, but added that finding a solution would be no easy task.
""It's very necessary to come and see everything at place here in Bangladesh and Myanmar. But there is no magic solution, there is no magic stick to solve all these issues,"" The Associated Press news agency quoted him as saying.
Al Jazeera's Charles Stratford, Reporting from Cox's Bazar, said female refugees in tears had told the representatives about being raped and losing family members.
The representatives were also shown a presentation that included ""very graphic photographs"" of what they were told were Rohingya refugees who had been killed as they tried to escape Myanmar.
""Today's events have been a big eye-opener for this delegation,"" Stratford said.
Hundreds of thousands of Rohingya refugees started arriving in Bangladesh in August last year, after Myanmar's army launched a violent crackdown on Rohingya in Rakhine State.
Myanmar security forces were accused of rape, murder, torture and setting Rohingya homes on fire.
Doctors Without Borders (MSF) said that in the first month of the crackdown, 6,700 mostly Muslim Rohingya were killed.
On Monday, the diplomats will continue on to Myanmar for a meeting with State Councillor Aung San Suu Kyi and a tour by helicopter of Rakhine State.

Yarmouk, which has been besieged by the Syrian government and opposition groups since 2013, was once home to nearly 200,000 people, among them Palestinian refugees, Syrians and others.
""Those stark figures tell their own tragic story, of the destruction of a once thriving refugee community, now reduced to abject, untold suffering,"" Chris Gunness, a spokesperson for UNRWA, the body responsible for Palestinian refugees, told Al Jazeera.
""Many are sleeping in the streets and begging for medicine.
""There is almost no water or electricity. Their suffering is unimaginable.""
On April 19, the Syrian government and allied armed groups, including some Palestinian factions, launched a renewed military offensive targeting Yarmouk and surrounding areas citing the presence of fighters.
Among the fighters present in Yarmouk are those from the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) group, and Hay'et Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), formerly known as Jabhat al-Nusra.
Monitors have accused the government of carrying out an intense campaign of air raids as well as using barrel bombs, missiles and shells.
As of Friday, at least 31 people had been killed over a week of intensified violence, according to the UK-based Action Group for Palestinians of Syria.
Inside the camp, there are currently no hospitals or medical facilities operating, the Action Group said, adding that up to 60 percent of Yarmouk has been destroyed.
""We are calling on all sides in this conflict to take measures to spare civilians and civilian infrastructure,"" UNRWA's Gunness said.
""And we are asking that civilians, the wounded, the sick who want to leave to have safe passage. We also urgently need humanitarian access to distribute assistance.""
Gunness further said that armed groups and government forces should respect ""international law … at all times"".
Before the war in Syria broke out in March 2011, about 560,000 Palestinian refugees, who were originally displaced from their homeland during Israel's 1948 establishment, lived in camps, cities and towns across the country.
UNRWA estimates that more than 120,000 Palestinians have been displaced yet again, some of them multiple times.
With the latest round of fighting, the number of Palestinian refugees left in Yarmouk camp could have sunk to ""just a few hundred"", Gunness said.
In a joint report published last week with other watchdogs, Action Group for Palestinians of Syria said the camp had been targeted with at least two air raids every 90 seconds during the ongoing offensive.
On Friday, SANA, Syria's state media, said the operation was aimed at dislodging ""terrorists"" from Yarmouk and surrounding areas, including al-Hajar al-Aswad and Yelda.
Yarmouk is not the only Palestinian refugee camp that has endured violence during the war.
Earlier this month, clashes between Syrian government forces and armed opposition groups took a heavy toll on the civilian infrastructure in Deraa camp, where up to 80 percent of the homes and buildings have been destroyed or damaged throughout the seven-year war.
Residents of that camp have endured frequent clashes, a lack of basic humanitarian services and periodic water cuts, some lasting for up to 1,475 days, according to the Action Group.
In March 2011, a large-scale uprising against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad broke out.
Since then, the conflict has morphed into a full-scale civil war that has left hundreds of thousands dead and displaced millions.
At least 3,729 Palestinian refugees have died throughout the seven-year conflict, while another 309 are considered missing and 1,674 are imprisoned, as reported by the Action Group.
In January, US President Donald Trump threatened to withdraw funding for UNRWA if Palestinians did not return to negotiations with Israel.
Trump's comments, which were repeated by Nikki Haley, the US ambassador to UN, prompted widespread criticism.
In response, 21 aid groups voiced their staunch condemnation of the decision, warning of ""dire consequences"" for Palestinian refugees, including those in war-torn Syria.

A fourth victim, a 15-year old boy named Azzam Hillal, died of his wounds on Saturday. He was shot in the head by Israeli military during Friday's protest.
Among the wounded, 178 were shot with live ammunition on Friday while others sustained injuries from rubber-coated steel rounds, or required treatment for tear gas exposure.
Thousands gathered in the besieged Gaza Strip for the fifth-straight Friday as part of a mass sit-in known as the Great March of Return movement. Palestinians have been demanding the right to return to their homes seized by Israel in 1948.
The protests raised the total death toll to at least 45 Palestinian demonstrators, with more than 6,000 wounded since the mass movement began on March 30. There have been no Israeli casualties.
Al Jazeera's Stefanie Dekker, reporting from the scene in Gaza, said thousands of demonstrators were seen ""running towards the border fence with Israel, the closest that they have ever been in the past five weeks of protests"".
""We heard an opening of live fire [by Israeli forces] trying to push people back from that border,"" Dekker said.
""Israel has made it very clear that they want people to stay away from ... what they call a buffer zone. They say people will be shot.""
Eighteen medical personnel and journalists were among the wounded.
Ashraf al-Qidra, spokesperson for Gaza's health ministry, said Israeli forces also targeted medical service points twice with quantities of unidentified gas east of the Al-Bureij refugee camp in central Gaza.
A number of victims experienced convulsions, severe vomiting and suffocation as a result of their exposure, he said.
Known as the world's ""largest open-air prison"", an Israeli-Egyptian blockade has been suffocating the Gaza Strip for the past decade and residents say they have reached a breaking point.
Living conditions have severely deteriorated over the years. Youth unemployment is at 60 percent and residents typically only receive four hours of electricity a day.
Many medical patients die a slow death because Gaza does not have basic medical resources, and they are unable to leave Gaza for treatment elsewhere because of the blockade.
The situation has become so desperate that ""people have lost their fear"" and will continue to protest at the border despite the danger of facing live fire by Israeli forces, Dekker explained, noting when demonstrators came under a barrage of fire at the border fence, they did not run back.
""Yes, they go to the border fence; yes, they throw stones; yes, they throw Molotov cocktails, but you're dealing with one of the best-equipped armies in the world,"" she said.
""This is their way of resisting what they call the occupation, resisting the blockade that gives them no freedom of movement.
""Their situation is so miserable in Gaza. I've been reporting from the Gaza Strip for years and it's never been this bad.""
Israeli officials have accused Gaza's rulers Hamas of instigating the protests, but not a single rocket has been fired from the Gaza Strip since the demonstrations began.
Amnesty International on Friday called for governments worldwide to impose an arms embargo on Israel following the country's ""disproportionate response"" to the demonstrations along the border fence.
""The nature of these injuries shows that Israeli soldiers are using high-velocity military weapons designed to cause maximum harm to Palestinian protesters that do not pose imminent threat to them,"" an Amnesty report noted.
""These apparently deliberate attempts to kill and main are deeply disturbing, not to mention completely illegal. Some of these cases appear to amount to wilful killing, a grave breach of the Geneva Conventions and a war crime.""
Earlier on Friday, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein condemned Israel's use of ""excessive force"" against Palestinian protesters, saying its security forces must be held to account.
""The loss of life is deplorable and the staggering number of injuries caused by live ammunition only confirms the sense that excessive force has been used against demonstrators - not once, not twice, but repeatedly,"" Zeid said.
Palestinians have long demanded that as many as five million direct descendants of the original Palestinian refugees be given the right of return to their ancestral homes.
Israel has ruled out the demand, arguing the Palestinians returning to what is now Israel would outnumber its Jewish majority.
The Great March of Return movement is officially scheduled to continue until May 15, known as Nakba Day, marking the expulsion of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians during the creation of Israel.
However, with no alternatives, many participants believe the movement will continue beyond that date.

Citing an eyewitness, the UK-based Action Group for Palestinians of Syria said on Friday that the destruction has largely been caused by barrel bombs, missiles and shelling.
The group said that ""families were buried under the rubble of their homes"" in Yarmouk, where an estimated 3,000 people still reside.
On Wednesday, Palestinian refugee Salah al-Abayat was killed by Syrian government air strikes on the camp, bringing the total number of people killed to 31 since April 19, when the latest bout of fighting started.
On April 19, the Syrian government and allied Palestinian armed groups launched a renewed military offensive against armed groups - including the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL, also known as ISIS) - in the besieged refugee camp.
On Thursday, Palestinian political party Hamas issued an appeal to all sides involved in the fighting to reach a truce.
That same day, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA), warned of ""catastrophic consequences"" of the intensified violence in Yarmouk and the surrounding areas, including al-Hajar al-Aswad and Yalda.
""Yarmouk and its inhabitants have endured indescribable pain and suffering over years of conflict,"" Pierre Krahenbuhl, UNRWA's commissioner-general, said in a statement.
""We are deeply concerned about the fate of thousands of civilians, including Palestine refugees, after more than a week of dramatically increased violence.""
The UN group said that there are no hospitals currently operational in the camp, which has been blockaded by government forces on the one hand, and armed opposition groups on the other for several years.
""The intense bombing and shelling has reportedly damaged thousands of homes,"" UNRWA said in its statement, calling for ""immediate granting of safe passage for civilians wishing to leave the camp and surrounding areas"".
UNRWA added: ""There is no more running water and very little electricity.""
An estimated 200,000 people - Palestinian refugees, Syrians and others - lived in Yarmouk before Syria's war started in March 2011.
Since 2013, government forces and armed groups loyal to President Bashar al-Assad have imposed a harsh siege on Yarmouk, restricting the flow of food, medicine and other humanitarian goods into the camp.
As the siege wore on, residents of Yarmouk were reduced to eating grass and stray animals to survive, according to reports at the time.
In March 2015, the situation in Yarmouk worsened when ISIL invaded the camp and took control of most of its territory.
On April 22, Action Group for Palestinians of Syria, the Palestinian Return Centre, the France-based Democratic Republic Studies Centre and the Syrian Centre for Media and Freedom of Expression published a joint report detailing the grim situation in Yarmouk.
According to that report - Yarmouk Set on Fire (PDF) - the camp had been bombed twice every 90 seconds since the start of the latest military offensive on April 19.
Last Sunday alone, Yarmouk was bombarded with 140 Syrian and Russian air strikes, 78 barrel bombs and 98 surface-to-surface missiles, the report said.
Upwards of 430,000 Palestinian refugees still live in Syria, many trapped in besieged or hard-to-reach areas, according to UNRWA.
Action Group for Palestinians of Syria says at least 3,729 Palestinian refugees have been killed during Syria's civil war, while 309 are considered missing and another 1,674 are currently detained.
SANA, the Syrian government's state media outlet, said on Friday that government forces were advancing in several areas in southern Damascus, including al-Hajar al-Aswad, the neighbourhood situated adjacent to Yarmouk.
Many Palestinian refugees from Yarmouk have been displaced to al-Hajar al-Aswad.
Friday's report came just one day after SANA reported that government forces had killed ""dozens of terrorists"" in the area.
Throughout seven years of war in Syria, hundreds of thousands of people have been killed and millions have fled Syria or are displaced within the country's borders.

Other members of the convoy included aid staff from Plan International, Action Africa Help, the South Sudanese Development Organisation and ACROSS.
Aid workers have frequently been targeted by armed forces operating in South Sudan since an ethnically-charged civil war erupted in December 2013 when troops loyal to President Salva Kiir and then-Vice President Riek Machar clashed.
A peace deal brokered between Machar and Kiir in August 2015 led to the creation of a unity government the following April.
The administration, however, broke down after only three months when violence erupted again between government forces and Machar's Sudan People's Liberation Movement-in-Opposition (SPLM-IO) fighters.
Alain Noudehou, the UN's humanitarian coordinator for South Sudan, said on Thursday he was urgently seeking information on the case.
""We are deeply concerned about the whereabouts of these humanitarian workers and are urgently seeking information about their well-being,"" Noudehou said.
""These individuals, UN and NGO staff, are here to help the people of South Sudan and should not be targeted. Our colleagues must be released without condition so that their work can continue.""
Noudehou also called on ""all parties to the conflict"" in South Sudan to provide a safe environment within which aid can be delivered.
Lem Paul Gabriel, a deputy spokesman for the SPLM-IO, said on Thursday the group's forces were investigating the incident, Reuters news agency reported.
""I am not denying or accepting that we are the ones responsible for this but we are investigating because that is our territory, but we should not rule out the presence of other armed forces,"" Gabriel said.
""So until we get that report from the ground commander, we will not be able to confirm.""
Wednesday's incident marks the second occasion on which aid workers have been held by armed groups in April, and the third in six months, according to the UNOCHA.
Since its outset, the conflict has resulted in the deaths of tens of thousands of people - including at least 98 aid workers - and led to more than four million people being displaced from their homes, according to the UN.
The war - described by Filippo Grandi, the UN high commissioner for refugees, as having a human cost of ""epic proportions"" - has created Africa's biggest refugee crisis since the 1994 Rwandan genocide.

On Tuesday, 21 groups issued a joint statement condemning the government's move to overturn a court ruling allowing newly-arrived refugees and migrants to move from the islands to mainland Greece.
Describing the restrictions on movement as a ""containment policy"", the NGOs said the measure ""raises rule of law concerns"".
Among the groups that published the statement were Human Rights Watch, Greek Helsinki Monitor, EuroMed Rights, Lesbos Legal Centre, Oxfam and Solidarity Now, among others.
On April 17, the Council of State, Greece's highest administrative court, ruled that there was no legal justification for barring asylum seekers from moving from the increasingly overcrowded refugee camps on Greek islands to the country's mainland.
Three days later, however, the director of asylum services issued an order reinstating the restrictions of freedom of movement for asylum seekers. On Monday, parliament began discussing a bill drafted to formalise the restrictions.
In Tuesday's statement, the rights groups and aid organisations said: ""there is no evidence that lifting the containment policy would be a pull factor, as Greece and others claim, especially given the largely closed borders along the Western Balkan migration route into Western Europe"".
""Containing asylum seekers on the Greek islands in substandard and appalling conditions that violate their rights and Greece's international obligations cannot be justified for migration control purposes,"" the statement said.
Upwards of 15,000 refugees and migrants are currently stranded on the Greek islands, from which they cannot leave without permission from the authorities. The islands have seen growing tensions, including racist attacks.
On Tuesday, Migration Minister Dimitris Vitsas downplayed concerns about conditions on the islands hosting asylum seekers.
""I'm not scared about the islands because we know what we have to do. What is really worrisome is the huge increase through Evros,"" he said, as reported by the Greek daily Ekathimerini.
On Sunday night, hundreds of far-right demonstrators swarmed Sapphous Square in Mytilene, the capital of Lesbos Island, and attacked a group of refugees who had been occupying the square for several days.
Yelling ""burn them alive"" and other violent threats, the assailants threw rocks, bottles and flares at the asylum seekers.
Police intervened, but at least 10 people were hospitalised with injuries by the time the incident came to an end.
More than 100 people were arrested.
The following day, police forcibly transferred the protesting refugees and migrants back to Moria, an overcrowded camp where living conditions have prompted widespread criticism from rights groups and monitors.
Spiros Galinos, the mayor of the island, subsequently published a statement blaming the Syriza-led government for the violence.
""Despite repeated requests from every level, but also desperate cries for help over the Sapphous Square protest, including amid fears of a reaction stemming from the local community's fear, the government's persistent lack of action resulted in yesterday's events,"" Galinos said.
The mayor went on to say that ""the responsibility for what happened lies exclusively with the government and the way it has for months handled the situation on the islands"".
According to the United Nations refugee agency (UNHCR), at least 7,497 refugees and migrants have reached Greece so far this year.
While many make the treacherous journey by boat across the Mediterranean Sea, an increasing number of people have entered Greece by crossing the country's land border with Turkey.

https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/04/venezuela-malaria-cases-jump-69-percent-180424172239443.html,refugee,481,Wed Apr 25 2018 05:40:34 GMT+0000,None,WHO: Venezuela malaria cases jump by 69 percent,"Health experts have warned that malaria cases in Venezuela jumped by an estimated 69 percent last year, expressing concern over the spread of the disease in the crisis-hit country and other parts of Latin America.
The figure was released by the World Health Organization (WHO) on Tuesday, on the eve of World Malaria Day.
According to the UN health agency's estimates, cases of malaria in Venezuela rose from to 240,613 in 2016 to 406,000 in 2017.
The current figures are around five times higher than the 2013 ones for the mosquito-borne disease.
""What we are now seeing is a massive increase, probably reaching close to half a million cases per year,"" Pedro Alonso, director of WHO's global malaria programme, told reporters on Tuesday.
""These are the largest increases reported anywhere in the world,"" he added, blaming a lack of resources and ineffective anti-malaria campaigns.
Venezuelan migrants fleeing the economic and social crisis are carrying the mosquito-borne disease into Brazil and other parts of Latin America, WHO said, urging authorities to provide free screening and treatment regardless of their legal status to avoid further spread.
""In the Americas, it's not just Venezuela. We're actually reporting increases in a number of other countries,"" said Alonso.
""Venezuela, yes this is a significant concern, malaria is increasing and it's increasing in a very worrying way.""
The Venezuelan government's organisation overseeing healthcare in the country, El Ministerio del Poder Popular para la Salud, refused to comment on the matter when approached by Al Jazeera.
The socioeconomic and political crisis in Venezuela has reportedly resulted in 85 percent shortages of medicines, hyperinflation, poor hospital conditions and migrations abroad - as medical professionals leave the country.
According to the United Nations Refugee Agency, around 660,000 Venezuelans reside in neighbouring Colombia, while 100,000 others have reportedly entered northern Peru.
On the Brazilian border in Boa Vista, the capital of Roraima state, around 10 percent of the 450,000 residents are reportedly Venezuelan.
""We are seeing indeed because of population movement, cases among Venezuelan migrants appearing in other countries - Brazil certainly. But also in Colombia, in Ecuador and in a number of other places,"" said Alonso.
WHO said they are working alongside both Pan-American Health Organization (PAHO) and Venezuelan authorities to remedy the situation.
The UN has advocated that authorities provide free screening and treatment to stop the spread further, irrespective of the legal status of the migrant.
""What this calls for is renewed effort by the countries surrounding Venezuela to ensure adequate diagnosis and treatment free for whoever shows up at medical services,"" said Alonso.
Venezuela was the first country to have eradicated malaria in 1961 by the WHO - ahead of the US and other developed nations.
In 2016, malaria killed 445,000 people across 91 countries - 90 percent of deaths occur in Africa according to the WHO.

""Doomsday,"" says the 35-year-old. ""It's like Judgement Day.""
Al-Sayed is a former resident of Hajar al-Aswad, one of the neighbourhoods of the besieged Palestinian refugee camp of Yarmouk which is currently under attack by forces loyal to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and Russian fighter jets.
Activists say at least 15 civilians have been killed and more than 100 wounded since the fierce push to retake Hajar al-Aswad, Tadamun and Beit Sahem - which make up a considerable chunk of Yarmouk - began on April 19.
Before the Syrian war started in 2011, the camp was home to Syria's largest Palestinian refugee population.
In the years that followed, most of its residents fled to other parts of Syria or neighbouring countries seeking refuge. In 2015 Yarmouk came under the control of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL, also known as ISIS) group.
The six-day operation by Syrian government forces and their allies to drive out ISIL fighters has now turned the camp into a ""ghost town"", al-Sayed, who is currently based in the nearby rebel-held town of Yalda, told Al Jazeera on Monday.
""No clinics, no doctors, no supplies - it's pretty much empty,"" he added.
""People are not able to leave to purchase things they need. If they leave, they have to walk miles before seeing another person in the street; it is that uncommon to see people outside.""
The United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) estimates that over the past few days some 5,000 Palestinians from Yarmouk have been displaced to Yalda. The agency, which cited ""reports"" for the figure, has not been able to provide assistance to the camp since 2015.
Local activists say there have been no ""formal"" evacuations, and those who managed to make it to neighbouring Yalda did so under a rebel-brokered agreement.
UNRWA spokesperson Chris Gunness told Al Jazeera that only 1,200 people remain inside Yarmouk, while activists in nearby towns held by rebel factions have given a similar figure.
Yarmouk residents have had little access to the outside world, owing to a lack of cell service and a government-imposed siege in place since 2012. Activists in the area say these obstacles have made documenting the number of people killed and wounded in the camp a daunting task.
""The humanitarian situation in Yarmouk is simply indescribable,"" Ammar al-Midani, one of several Yalda-based activists who work on compiling information from Hajar al-Aswad through their communication with trapped civilians, told Al Jazeera on Monday.
""From surface-to-surface missiles to barrel and cluster bombs and mortar fire, simply disastrous,"" al-Midani said.
At times, al-Midani says activists like him are unable to reach residents who are hiding underground, other times, he says, they manage to get through to their friends and family in the area.
""People are terrified, mostly hiding in man-made bunkers. No one is able to reach those in the heart of the camp because of ISIL's control of the area - it's a new kind of siege.""
Since last week, Syrian government forces and their allies have intensified efforts to regain all ground near Damascus.
Besides Yarmouk, their goal is to also drive out fighters from rebel groups Jaish al-Islam and Hay'et Tahrir al-Sham, which remain in control of pockets such as the towns of Yalda, Babbila, and al-Qadam - all of which lie south of Damascus and only one kilometre away from Yarmouk.
On Tuesday, government forces launched air raids in Yalda, killing 10 fighters from Jaish al-Islam, according to activists.
Meanwhile, state-news agency SANA said on Tuesday that government forces were targeting ISIL ""tunnels and trenches"" in Yarmouk.
According to activists, more than 580 air raids struck Hajar al-Aswad and Tadamun since Thursday evening, the majority of which targeted ""civilian basements"".
On Sunday, Yarmouk's only hospital was totally put out of service after being destroyed in an air raid.
Both al-Midani and al-Sayed said the toll of 15 victims so far included only those whose deaths were able to be documented, while others remain ""unfound, and unaccounted for under the rubble"".
Residents of the besieged camp have called on Palestinian leaders, including the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) - an umbrella of major Palestinian political parties - to help bring relief to the people of Yarmouk.
A journalist based in neighbouring Babbila, who identified himself only as Youssef, said people in the camp are puzzled as to why no one from the Palestinian leadership has spoken out about recent events affecting thousands of Palestinian refugees.
The escalation is the latest in a series of devastating episodes to have hit civilians in Yarmouk.
The camp was home to 160,000 Palestinian refugees before 2011. But as Syria slid into war, fighting between rebels and Syrian forces quickly extended to Yarmouk too, with residents paying the price of a deteriorating humanitarian situation.
Over the years, the lack of food and medicine amid the siege, coupled with heavy battles - including between rebel groups - and the seizure of the camp by ISIL in 2015, pushed many to negotiate evacuation deals.
Among those forced to leave was Majd al-Masry. Born in the camp, the Palestinian former paramedic is now based in Yalda and among those documenting violations taking place in Yarmouk.
The closure of the camp's only ""lifeline"", a corridor that led to Yalda, during the siege was one of the cruelest war tactics, al-Masry said.
""A war on stomachs; a war on health; and a psychological war,"" he said, summarising the three years he witnessed at the camp before leaving in 2015.
""Managing attacks from multiple fronts, and diseases like salmonella, kidney failure, typhoid fever, and more - this was my life,"" al-Masry said.
The Syrian government has since 2015 regained control of the majority of Syria, with opposition groups now restricted to the northern part of the country, namely Idlib province.
It has thus far managed to regain large swaths of land through a series of evacuation deals that usually come amid a military offensive.
On Monday, Syrian state TV reported that government forces were moving to encircle ISIL fighters from the nearby rebel-held suburbs in an attempt to land an evacuation deal or a withdrawal.
Activists Al Jazeera spoke to said the ""destruction"" campaign in Yarmouk was a ""classic"" tactic employed by the government before such a deal.
Amid similar circumstances earlier this month, the government regained control of Eastern Ghouta, a major Damascus suburb that was once home to 400,000 people.
With the offensive in southern Damascus likely to mark the latest rebel defeat, the balance of power in Syria's war- now in its eighth year, keeps tilting in favour of Assad and his allies.
However, activists say the situation in Yarmouk cannot be described as a ""war"".
""We can't say this is a war. In war, there are emergency medical teams, hospitals, shelters, a chance for a truce and for safe corridors,"" al-Sayed said.
""But here, it's annihilation.""

Evidence collected as part of that investigation led to the pre-emptive seizure of the vessel - the only one operated by the small German non-profit Jugend Rettet (""youth rescue"") - under accusations of abetting illegal migration and collusion with smugglers.
The Iuventa has been held in the port of Trapani since a judge in the western Sicilian city ruled in favour of the prosecution's request for pre-emptive seizure, based on an anti-mafia law and done in order to prevent the alleged crimes from being committed again.
The Iuventa had become the primary target of an investigation, which included the use of an undercover agent, bugging devices, tapped phone calls as well as informant testimonies, into rescue operations in the Mediterranean.
Lawyers filed an appeal against the seizure, questioning the nature of the accusations, as well as Italy's jurisdiction on incidents that took place in international waters.
Aiding and abetting illegal migration can carry a prison sentence ranging from five to 15 years, and a fine of 15,000 euros (about $18,300) for each person who has been let in the country. Prosecutors, however, have yet to file official charges against individuals involved in the events in question.
Italy's Supreme Court of Cassation will publish an explanatory statement in the coming weeks.
A spokesperson declined Al Jazeera's request for further comment until then.
""We take note of the decision, but we are waiting for the end of the investigation and have to evaluate possible further action after the court publishes the reasoning behind it,"" Isabel Grahn, a spokesperson for Jugend Rettet, told Al Jazeera.
""We can only speculate,"" Grahn added.
""It's possible there will be accusations. We don't know where the Italian prosecutor stands.""
We are devastated by the Court's ruling of today: The IUVENTA will not be free! But we will fight for the right to rescue of people in distress at sea. #freeIUVENTA #Right2Rescue pic.twitter.com/fV03LmATui
Tuesday's ruling is a renewed blow for NGOs operating sea rescues in the Mediterranean, after a court in Sicily last week ordered the release of another NGO boat, the Open Arms - one of two vessels run by the Spanish NGO Proactiva. The Open Arms vessel was allowed to leave the port of Pozzallo a month after its crew refused to hand 218 rescued migrants over to the EU and Italy-funded Libyan coastguard.
Italy's deal with Libya, aimed at curbing migration across the central Mediterranean route, has been criticised by human rights groups for allowing migrants and refugees to be brought back to a country where they face human rights violations.
NGOs, which filled a gap left at the end of 2014 when Italy and the EU pulled back from sea rescue arguing it encouraged people to risk the crossing, have been accused of facilitating illegal migration. The Italian media and right-wing proponents call the rescue boats ""sea taxis"".
Critics of this argument say that it doesn't consider the ""push-factors"" out of Libya - a country that has been marred by a power vacuum and political instability since the fall of Gaddafi in 2011. Numerous reports have emerged of migrants and refugees suffering systematic abuse in Libya, including detention, extortion and forced labour.
While arrivals have decreased - 181,436 in 2016 to 119,130 in 2017 - data shows that the mortality rate of those who cross from Libya to Italy has risen. According to UNHCR, one in 14 people died crossing from Libya to Italy this year, compared with one in 29 in the same period last year.
A shipwreck last Sunday left 11 dead, bringing to more than 500 the number of people that have died or disappeared while trying to reach Europe this year.
Days before the confiscation of the Iuventa, Jugend Rettet, alongside other rescue organisations, had refused to sign a Code of Conduct passed by the Italian government for NGOs performing rescues in the Mediterranean. The Code, which is not legally binding, included allowing armed judicial police agents onboard.
The number of NGOs operating in the central Mediterranean has decreased dramatically since then.
The seizure of the Iuventa was ordered based principally on three episodes that took place on September 10, 2016, and in June 18 and 26, 2017.
According to the Trapani judiciary, these incidents demonstrate that Iuventa crew members had direct contact with Libyan smugglers and operated in coordination with them.
The motivation behind their actions, the prosecutors themselves point out, remained essentially of a humanitarian nature as the crew did not receive money. The preliminary investigation also alleges the crew neglected to destroy the dinghies used by refugees after their rescue, instead, leaving them for smugglers to reuse.
London-based research organisation Forensic Architecture conducted a counterinvestigation and published video reconstructions of the incidents based on photos and videos released by crew members and journalists on board of other vessels that intervened in the rescues in question, as well as taped conversations with the central command and logbooks. The group refuted some of the claims made by the Italian prosecutors, arguing the images that had been circulated by the media had been taken out of context.
""What the Italian authorities are doing is completely excessive and doesn't have any legal basis in international law,"" Violeta Moreno-Lax, told Al Jazeera.
""Rescue is not only not a crime, but is necessary under international law. The obligation is to perform rescue, not to abstain from it.""
Moreno-Lax added that ""If you analyse the different cases in which the Iuventa has been accused of collusion with traffickers, not only there is no base in the law to qualify that as not being rescue, but you will see that every time they follow the instruction of the IMRCC (Italian Maritime Rescue Coordination Centre, making the charges of) facilitation of irregular entry completely illusory.
""It banalises what criminal behaviour means, if you call anything and everything migrant smuggling and human trafficking.""

Saturday's visit to Douma came a week after the fact-finding mission of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) first arrived in Syria, and amid growing questions about whether there would still be enough evidence for the investigators to gather.
In a statement, the OPCW said its team had visited one of the sites of the alleged attack to collect samples for analysis.
""The OPCW will evaluate the situation and consider future steps including another possible visit to Douma,"" it said.
""Based on the analysis of the sample results as well other information and materials collected by the team, the FFM (fact-finding mission) will compile their report for submission to the States Parties to the Chemical Weapons Convention for their consideration.""
Earlier on Saturday, the foreign ministry of Russia, a major ally of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, had also said that the OPCW inspectors had entered Douma.
The US and France have accused Russia of blocking access to the site, where rescuers and medics say dozens of people were killed on April 7.
The Syrian government and Moscow say the alleged chemical attack, which prompted a series of air strikes by Western allies as an act of retaliation, was staged.
The OPCW team arrived in Damascus on Saturday but had not been able to travel to Douma, on the outskirts of the capital, due to security concerns following a reconnaissance mission by a United Nations team at two sites in the town on Tuesday.
The UN Department of Safety and Security (UNDSS) officials had to withdraw from the first location as the presence of large crowd there raised security fears.
At the second site, they came under small arms fire and an explosive device was detonated nearby, the OPCW said in a statement.
There were no injuries and the UN team returned to Damascus, but the watchdog had to postpone its visit.
In a statement on Saturday, Maria Zakharova, spokesperson for the Russian foreign ministry, said the delays to the OPCW team were ""unacceptable"".
On Monday, during an emergency meeting at the OPCW's headquarters in The Hague, Western diplomats accused the Syrian government and Moscow of obstructing the team.
Russia denied the claims, saying parts of Douma still needed to be de-mined and said the watchdog's inspectors would enter on Wednesday.
Yet, France and the US appeared to question the purpose of such a mission, warning at the time that any incriminating evidence had likely been removed by then.
Earlier this week, Ishak Majali, a former OPCW inspector, said it was unlikely the inspectors would find evidence at the site after such delay.
""It has been a lot of time since the attack took place,"" he told Al Jazeera.
""So, if you are in control of a site with chemicals for such a long time, it's very easy actually to tamper with the place and to change the facts on the ground.
""You can actually do what we call it in the military business as the decontamination process, which is to remove all the evidence on the ground by using other chemicals to neutralise the chemicals on the ground. Also, you can tamper with the munition itself ... to prepare some witnesses or to prepare some medical reports.""
The town of Douma was under rebel control and facing a government air and ground assault when the suspected attack took place.
Images that emerged from Douma at the time showed lifeless bodies collapsed in crowded rooms, some with foam around their noses and mouths.
Opposition groups gave up the town in the days after the incident. Thousands of people - rebels and civilians - left on buses to northern Syria, believing they could not reconcile with the government after it took over the town.
The evacuations were the latest in a string of population transfers around the Syrian capital that have displaced more than 60,000 people as the government reconsolidates control after seven years of civil war.
UN officials and human rights groups say the evacuations amount to a forced population displacement that may be a war crime.
Also on Saturday, Syrian government forces continued an offensive against rebel-held parts of the capital's outskirts, in a bid to drive out remaining armed opposition groups, according to state media and war monitors.
Rebel-held pockets near Damascus have been witnessing intense bombardment and shelling from Assad's forces since Thursday.
Some of the areas, including Hajar al-Aswad and Tadamun in the southern district of Damascus, have been under Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL, also known as ISIS) group's control since April 2015.
The areas comprise the majority of the Palestinian Yarmouk refugee camp, which lies about 8km from central Damascus.

Although just 16 years old now, Omar could be sentenced to life in prison stemming from his arrest on February 18, 2016.
Samir Mahmoud al-Rimawi, Omar's 49-year-old father, and Lana, his mother, have attended more than 40 court sessions in that time.
Sitting with Omar's siblings in their home, Samir and Lana struggle to hold back tears as they recall the painful details of their son's imprisonment.
Coming back from yet another court hearing, they had no new information for Omar's brothers and sisters.
Omar is a bright boy, was a model student at an upscale private school in Ramallah, and he excelled in football, swimming and karate, his parents tell Al Jazeera. His family dreamed that he would one day become a doctor.
Samir recalls the fateful evening when he learned of Omar's arrest.
On that night, his son was meant to be attending an English-language course, but Samir received a shocking phone call from Israeli intelligence demanding that he come to the interrogation centre where Omar was being held at the Qalandia checkpoint between Jerusalem and Ramallah.
The voice on the other end of the phone did not explain why Samir was being summoned, but within a few minutes, he learned from Israeli media reports that Omar and his friend Ayman al-Sabah, both of whom were 14 at the time, had been shot at a Rami Levy supermarket near Ramallah.
The boys were accused of carrying out a deadly stabbing attack.
Israel's widespread arrests and imprisonment of Palestinian children have been broadly condemned by human rights groups and watchdogs.
Omar and Ayham are among more than 350 Palestinian children who are currently in Israeli lockup, according to a joint statement recently published by the Palestinian Committee for Prisoners Affairs and the Palestinian Prisoners Club.
Thus far in 2018, Israeli forces have arrested more than 353 children, and at least 102 - most of whom are from occupied East Jerusalem - were placed under house arrest between December 2017 and February this year.
The joint statement painted a bleak picture for Palestinian children in Israeli custody. The allegations include the use of brute force, restraining children in cruel ways, withholding food and water, violence and verbal aggression during interrogation and forcing confessions, among others.
Some of the children have been tried in absentia, while the majority have received what rights groups call unreasonably harsh sentences and expensive fines.
Ayed Abu Eqtaish, the accountability programme director at Defence for Children International - Palestine (DCI-P), argues that Israeli courts fail to respect established rules for detaining and trying children in court.
Although Israel is a signatory to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, it ignores that agreement's restrictions when dealing with Palestinian children, Abu Eqtaish tells Al Jazeera.
Rather than seeking alternatives to prison, Israeli courts regularly impose lengthy sentences on the children and impose costly fines on their families, Abu Eqtaish adds.
And despite Israel's use of forced confessions and other apparent violations of international norms, Abu Eqtaish fears that Israel has been allowed to operate with impunity.
In the wake of Omar's arrest, a flurry of contradictory stories began to circulate. Some of the rumours purported that the boys had been killed, while others alleged they were seriously injured by the gunshot wounds.
Israeli authorities, however, refused to update the Rimawi family about their son's health, Samir says. It was only six days later that they were finally permitted to visit Omar.
""Omar was in the intensive care unit, his hands and feet were restrained, and he was surrounded by three Israeli soldiers,"" Samir remembers grimly, explaining that Omar was subsequently carted from one prison to the next.
""I only saw him for five minutes, but during that time I found out that he had been paralysed because one of the three bullets that hit him had lodged in his spine. Another one had stopped near his heart, and the third had hit his arm.""
During that brief visit, Samir learned that Omar would need upwards of six years of physiotherapy if he were to ever walk again. He credits Omar's strong, athletic physique with allowing the boy to walk after a mere six months.
Samir accuses Israeli authorities of mistreating his son, alleging that Omar was left in the rain on a gurney outside the court where he had his first hearing only a few days after his arrest.
Since 2015, Israel has lowered the minimum age of criminal responsibility, allowing Palestinian children as young as 12 to be arrested and charged and making it easier for judges to hand down lengthy sentences to minors.
Ayham and Omar are both awaiting a verdict that could land them behind bars for life. Omar's family say his lawyer expects that Omar will ""most likely"" receive a life sentence as Israel's military court system has a 99 percent conviction rate.
A slew of reports in Israeli media outlets called for the boys to be severely punished, and Samir says the Israeli prosecutor's office has refused to negotiate with Omar's lawyers. Their appeals for compassion based on the boy's age have fallen on deaf ears.
Meanwhile, Samir and Lana are allowed to see Omar only once every three months, and Omar is barred from calling or writing to them.
""We visit with him behind a glass barrier; we can't hug or kiss him,"" Samir says. ""Every time we see him, he's grown, he's taller, and his mind has matured more.""
On June 22, Mohamed Tayseer Taha will turn 17. He will celebrate his birthday in prison, because, like hundreds of Palestinian children, he languishes behind bars.
His mother, Hanan, and father, Tayseer, sit in their home in the Shuafat refugee camp in East Jerusalem. The television is switched off; the home is silent and still, and photos of the absent teenager line the wall behind them.
""I wish I could serve his sentence in his place. I would do it rather than have him spend another minute in jail,"" Tayseer says before collapsing in tears and leaving the room to dry his eyes.
Mohamed, 14 at the time, was arrested on January 31, 2016, along with 16-year-old Monther Abou Miyala.
Accused of stabbing an Israeli settler in Jerusalem's Old City the day before, the boys had gone into hiding before eventually being arrested.
Fearing for the children's lives, their families had been searching frantically for them. ""An Israeli officer called me [on January 30] and said I had to hand over Mohamed or he would shoot and kill him wherever and whenever he found him,"" Tayseer says.
When Mohamed came home the next day, his family had no choice but to deliver him to Israeli authorities.
A year later, an Israeli court sentenced Mohamed to 11 years in prison and imposed a roughly $14,245 fine on his family.
His mother was shocked and stricken with grief.
""I never expected that ruling against Mohamed, every session I was expecting Mohamed to come home with me,"" Hanan says.
""The initial demand was that he be jailed five years, and we were shocked in that last session when the judge sentenced him to 11 years instead.""
Tayseer and Hanan are allowed to visit their son twice a month. But, like the Rimawi family, they can only communicate with him through a thick glass barrier.
""The visits are hard,"" Hanan explains. ""We're searched very thoroughly; then we have to wait for hours before we're able to get in and see him. When I finally do see him, everything I planned to say to him flies out of my mind, and I am happy just gazing at him.""
Mohamed tries to put on a happy appearance for his family. He avoids talking about his tribulations behind bars, and arrives for every scheduled meeting in tidy clothes, with well-groomed hair and a broad smile on his face.
But Hanan suspects Mohamed is trying to shield them from the pain he endures. ""I feel that Mohamed is hiding a lot from me, but he always tries to be strong in front of us [and] to only tell us the good news.""
Behind bars, Mohamed told his family, he had become a barber for the other children where he is imprisoned in Megiddo prison.
On several occasions, his fellow prisoners have visited the Taha family after being released from jail. They tell Tayseer and Hanan about how widely respected and loved Mohamed is, and one brought Hanan flowers at Mohamed's request.
Despite Mohamed's efforts, he cannot always hide his sadness from his mother. Sometimes he confides that he struggles with complex feelings of both happiness and despair when his cellmates are released, and fears that he will never be free.
Throughout his two years in prison, Mohamed has asked his parents to bring photos of his four siblings and his nieces and nephews as well as the family pets, including their dog, Rambo, and Mohamed's flock of pigeons.
For Tayseer, just being at home is a constant - and piercing - reminder of his son's imprisonment.
""I can't stay in the house with Mohamed not here,"" he says. ""I spend as much time as I can outside the house and come back at night to sit here and look at his photos and cry.""
They recently filed an appeal in Mohamed's case, but it was rejected, and his 11-year-sentence was upheld.
Nourhan was 16 years old when she was arrested in Jerusalem for allegedly attempting to stab an Israeli settler with scissors.
She had been a successful student, and continued her studies in prison, receiving a 94 percent score on the standardised high school exams. But rather than being able to plan for university, where she hoped to study law, Nourhan has to continue serving a 13-year prison sentence.
On November 23, 2016, Israeli forces shot Nourhan and her 14-year-old cousin Hadeel after the alleged attempted stabbing. Hadeel died on the spot, and Israeli forces arrested Nourhan, who had been left gravely injured and bleeding on the ground.
Four days later, while Nourhan was still in hospital and under the influence of powerful anaesthesia after surgery, Israeli interrogators questioned the girl, her mother tells Al Jazeera.
Her mother, Manal, says the family was stunned when an Israeli court later sentenced her to 13 years. They were also given an $8,000 fine.
""The lawyer told us that she would be sentenced to five years, but at the last session, we were shocked to hear the sentence - 13 years,"" Manal recollects. ""It was a terrible blow to all of us and to Nourhan. She fainted, and the rest of us ran out of the court crying and screaming.""
Remembering the arduous details of her daughter's arrest and sentencing, Manal is gradually overcome with tears.
""In the blink of an eye, Nourhan's childhood was stolen, she was wrenched from my arms and [she was] put in prison,"" Manal laments.
""I miss her every minute of the day. Her siblings have grown accustomed to her absence; they don't ask when she will be back - they ask when the next visit will be.""
In prison, Nourhan has remained an avid reader, always asking her month to bring new books when she visits.
""Every visit, Nourhan tells me about the latest book she read and gives me a synopsis of it,"" Manal explains.
""She told me that she has learned Hebrew and speaks it very well now and is also teaching math to the other imprisoned girls.""
Ever hopeful that Nourhan will eventually come home, Manal nonetheless has endured an array of punitive hardships imposed by Israeli authorities, including the cancellation of her husband's work permit and the family's reunification application.
Back in their Ramallah home, the Rimawi family knows Manal's pain well - and share her steadfast resolve to never abandon hope for the future.
""I know Omar will be sentenced to life in prison,"" Samir, Omar al-Rimawi's father, says.
""But I dream that he will be liberated and get some of his childhood back, continue the normal life I always hoped he would have.""

The Iranians are seeking refugee status in the US through the unique Lautenberg-Specter programme, which is meant to protect vulnerable groups such as religious minorities.
The programme began with the Lautenberg Amendment, passed in 1989, which allowed Jewish people from the former Soviet Union to apply for refugee status. In 2004, the Specter Amendment expanded the programme to Iranian nationals from minority religious groups.
The Lautenberg-Specter programme requires a US resident to apply on behalf of the Iranian citzen, who then goes through a screening process. If they pass, the applicant then travels to Austria to continue the process of gaining refugee status.
But in February, about 90 applicants who had already travelled through the programme ""received notices of denial that stated only that they were being denied 'as a matter of discretion',"" according to a press release from the International Refugee Assistance Project (IRAP).
Some of the Iranians had been waiting over a year, the release said.
The Iranians are represented by IRAP and the law firm of Latham & Watkins LLP.
Mariko Hirose, IRAP's litigation director, said in the statement the US government ""extended a helping hand to these Iranian … religious minorities only to cruelly whip it away for no discernible reason at all"".
One of the plaintiffs in the case, identified as Jane Doe #5, said in court filings that the blanket denial had ""terrible impact"" on her family.
""[B]ecause we had initially anticipated our stay in Austria to last only three to six months, we have run out of savings and are in dire financial straits,"" she said.
Belinda Lee, a partner with Latham & Watkins LLP, said their clients ""long to be reunited as families and free from the risk of deportation back to Iran, where they would be at an even greater risk of persecution"".
Critics of Iran claim the country favours the rights of its Muslim majority, while disadvantaging its many religious minorities, such as Christians, Jews, Zoroastrians and followers of the Bahai faith.
Others, however, highlight that Iran guarantees religious minorities such as Jews representation in its parliament.
President Hassan Rouhani pledged after he was elected in 2013 to work for the ""total"" freedom of Iranians in their personal lives.
""In today's world, having access to information and the right of free dialogue and the right to think freely is the right of all people, including the people of Iran,"" Rouhani told NBC News at the time.
The administration of US President Donald Trump has taken a hardline stance on Iran. The Trump administration has also initiated policies some have called ""Islamophobic"", including his executive order to ban immigration from some predominately-Muslim nations, including Iran.
The Trump team justified the orders, popularly called ""Muslim bans"", by citing national security concerns.
Daniel Mark, the chairman of the US Commission on International Religious Freedom, an independent government commission, said in a statement that national security ""must remain a priority for all US government policies …Yet we also must make timely security assessments in keeping with the intent of the Lautenberg Amendment"" to keep refugee applicants safe.
According to court documents, Jane Doe #5, waiting in Vienna, said she hopes the situation is soon resolved: ""I am anxious to travel to the US and be reunited with my in-laws.""

Syrian forces have for days been launching air attacks on the area controlled by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL, also known as ISIS) in the south of Damascus, primarily around the Palestinian Yarmouk refugee camp and its surrounding neighbourhoods, Al-Watan daily said.
""The two-day window is an attempt to avoid a military assault. If they refuse to leave, the army is ready to launch a military operation to end their presence in the area,"" the newspaper added.
Yarmouk, about 8km from central Damascus, was home to Syria's largest Palestinian refugee community before the Syrian war began more than seven years ago.
Although most of the camp's residents fled to other parts of Syria or to neighbouring countries, the United Nations estimates thousands remain trapped inside.
The camp has been under ISIL's control since April 2015, and has been under siege since late 2012, barring thousands from exit and re-entry.
Since 2015, the Syrian government has regained control of the majority of Syria, with opposition groups now restricted to the northern part of the country.
Though other pockets controlled by ISIL group fighters still exist, the armed group were driven out of their last major stronghold in Syria in October last year, when the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), an alliance of Kurdish and Arab forces backed by the United States, launched a four-month long offensive to push them out of Raqqa.

The announcement comes days after Haider al-Abadi, Iraq's prime minister, said his country would take action against ISIL if the fighters threatened Iraq's security.
Iraqi F-16 fighter jets crossed into Syria on Thursday in coordination with the Syrian army, al-Abadi's office said in a statement.
""Based on orders from the commander-in-chief of the armed forces, Haider al-Abadi, our heroic air force carried out deadly air strikes against ISIL sites in Syria on Thursday near the border with Iraq,"" it said.
According to the statement, the attacks countered dangers posed by ISIL and reflected the Iraqi armed forces' ""military capabilities in fighting terror"".
According to an Iraqi military spokesperson, the operation was fully coordinated with the Syrian army.
Al-Abadi formally declared victory over ISIL last year with the help of a coalition made up of Kurdish Peshmerga forces and Shia-dominated paramilitary units.
Iraq's army also received key air and ground support from an international coalition.
But ISIL still poses a threat from pockets along the border with Syria and has continued to carry out ambushes and bombings across Iraq.
Also on Thursday, ISIL fighters were given 48 hours to leave a pocket they control in the south of the Syrian capital, Damascus, pro-government Al-Watan daily reported.
The fighters have been in control of an area around the Palestinian Yarmouk refugee camp and its surrounding neighbourhoods south of Damascus for nearly three years.

https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/04/refugees-greek-islands-angry-freedom-arrivals-180419091938956.html,refugee,801,Thu Apr 19 2018 19:16:03 GMT+0000,John Psaropoulos,Refugees on Greek islands angry at freedom for new arrivals,"Athens, Greece - Elation has turned to anger for refugees on Greece's eastern Aegean islands, following a court ruling that prolongs their confinement to those islands, but allows new arrivals to leave immediately.
Greek authorities were reportedly already allowing free movement for refugees arriving on Wednesday, a day after the ruling by the Council of State.
Dozens of refugees on Wednesday occupied Sappho Square in Mytilene harbour on Lesbos, in protest against what they see as discrimination against them.
""[The refugees] are saying it's unfair,"" said Ariel Ricker, who founded Advocates Abroad, an organisation offering free legal aid to asylum applicants in Greece and the Middle East.
""It was done to unburden the island. It was clear that this was not done for the benefit of the refugees … so they're furious about it.""
There are also concerns that frustration at the double standard could lead to unrest.
""There has to be something coming after this that says, 'there will be a fair way to deal with those who have been waiting for two years',"" said Ricker. ""If it doesn't happen, there will be a fair amount of violence.""
More than 15,000 refugees are currently living on the islands of Rhodes, Kos, Leros, Samos, Chios and Lesbos, most of them in facilities built to house fewer than half that many.
The unreviewable ruling late on Tuesday overturned a decision of Greece's Asylum Service, which confined applicants for international protection to the six islands if they arrived after March 20, 2016.
That's when an agreement entered into force between the European Union (EU) and Turkey, obliging each party to quickly readmit people crossing their shared border without documents.
Since 2015, more than 1.5 million people have crossed from Turkey into EU member Greece, seeking protection from war or persecution in Africa and Asia.
Turkey needed some assurance that the people it was being asked to readmit had arrived in Greece after March 2016, and that it was not being asked to absorb refugees and economic migrants who had been in Greece for years.
""That could not be done if [asylum] applicants did not stay on the islands, until it was clear whether they were going to go in one or the other direction [deportation or asylum],"" said Maria Stavropoulou, the outgoing head of Greece's Asylum Service, who issued the original restriction.
The EU fully backed her. In December 2016, Greece's Migration Minister Yannis Mouzalas asked the European Commission for permission to move asylum applicants to the mainland for processing, but his request was denied.
However, the Greek Council for Refugees, a legal aid NGO, successfully challenged Stavropoulou's decision on the grounds that she was not legally competent to issue it in the first place.
Confinement to the islands after March 2016 was one of a series of deterrents that produced a dramatic drop in refugee arrivals in the Aegean - from an average of 2,700 a day in early 2016 to 300 a day by the end of March, and double digits after that.
Stavropoulou argued that the knowledge that refugees can immediately reach the European mainland will quickly encourage their numbers to rise again.
""I believe this butters the bread of smugglers, who will take full advantage of it,"" Stavropoulou told Al Jazeera. ""I am sure [this will encourage them to smuggle more people].""
The new freedom of movement is likely to be a false dawn for another reason. The Greek government has already submitted a bill to parliament that shores up the Asylum Service's authority by transposing an EU directive into Greek law.
""[Asylum] applicants may move freely within the territory of the host Member State or within an area assigned to them by that Member State,"" the directive says.
Stavropoulou believes that, armed with the new law, her successor will be able to re-issue the restriction.
Such a move would dismay organisations working with migrants.
""Trapping people indefinitely on islands in inhumane conditions should never be considered as a solution,"" said Luca Fontana, field co-ordinator for Doctors Without Borders (MSF) on Lesbos.
""Unfortunately, this decision only applies to the new arrivals and not to the thousands of people who have been trapped for months, sometimes years, on the Greek islands … We call on the Greek authorities to lift these restrictions independently from the date of arrival, to avoid creating unnecessary suffering for people who have already been pushed to their limit.""
Islanders have long complained of theft and house burglaries for which they consider refugees responsible. They also fear the loss of livelihoods from tourism.
""The resolution of the Council of State is proof that the geographical restriction is unjust for everyone,"" Lesbos Mayor Spyros Galinos wrote on Twitter.
""We hope that his is the beginning of the decongestion process for all the islands.""

The percentage of child brides in Syrian marriages in Jordan rose from 15 percent in 2014 to 36 percent this year.
Poverty is the primary reason driving families to marry off their daughters, as life for many refugees who have fled the conflict in Syria becomes increasingly difficult.
Last year, Jordan's chief justice issued new stipulations allowing girls the right to demand a marriage contract with conditions including completing their education and working.
But the United Nations children's agency says girls need even greater protections.
""What we would like to do more is the prevention,"" said UNICEF's Maha Homsi. ""It is working with the Sharia (Islamic law) courts and religious leaders to promote the right of girls to education and to break the cycle of poverty and prevent them from dropping out of school and going into early marriage.""
Fatima,16, was living in a Syrian refugee camp when she got married over a year ago. She now has a five-month-old daughter and another baby on the way.
Speaking to Al Jazeera, she said that while she loves her husband and feels that her early marriage is normal, she regrets being unable to complete her education after dropping out of school when she was 10 years old.
""I wish I could have continued my studies,"" she told Al Jazeera.
""I won't let my daughter get married young. She needs to be 25 or so. It's too much responsibility."""

""Russia and Syria have not yet allowed access to Douma,"" the British delegation tweeted on Sunday, adding that ""unfettered access [is] essential"" and ""Russia and Syria must cooperate"".
Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov immediately denied the allegations that inspectors were not being allowed access, according to Russian news agency RIA.
He said the arrival of the inspectors were delayed as a result of the US-led air raids on Saturday.
Syrian Deputy Foreign Minister Faisal al-Mokdad confirmed that government officials had met OPCW inspectors, according to Syrian state news agency SANA.
""The experts have been in Syria for the past three days upon the request of the Syrian government and several meetings were held during which the cooperation between the two sides was discussed,"" SANA quoted al-Mokdad as saying.
The OPCW, an intergovenmental organisation that oversees the implementation of the Chemical Weapons Convention, met delegates in The Hague on Monday to discuss events surrounding the April 7 attack in Douma.
Syrian government forces retook Douma last week, gaining full control over the former rebel-held enclave of Eastern Ghouta, Russian military officials announced at the time.
The announcement came just days after dozens people were killed by alleged chemical weapons attack in the town, sparking international outcry and prompting the US, UK and France to launch missile attacks on facilities believed to be used to research, develop and store chemical weapons inside Syria.
The Chemical Weapons Convention outlaws the production or stockpiling of chemical weapons.
Syria is a signatory of the treaty. Egypt, Israel, North Korea and South Sudan are the only nonsignatory nations.
Peter Wilson, the UK's OPCW envoy, told the watchdog body that failure to act in Syria will cause ""further barbaric use of chemical weapons.
Syria has lived through a seven-year civil war that has killed at least half a million people and created an international refugee crisis.
""The Syrian Regime has an abhorrent record of using chemical weapons against its own people. Chemical weapons use has become an all too regular weapon of war in the Syrian conflict,"" Wilson said, going on to cite 390 allegations of chemical weapons attacks since 2014.
Russia has impeded international bodies from investigating these attacks, Wilson added.
Russia told the UN last Friday that its experts found no trace of ""toxic substance use"" during their investigation in Douma.
Vassily Nebenzia, Russia's UN ambassador, said Russia has ""clear evidence"" that the chemical attack was staged.
For its part, France has said it has evidence Russia was responsible.
US Ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley has said her country will announce new sanctions on the Russian government in response to its support for Syria's Bashar al-Assad.

""This is a deception,"" Rohingya Blogger, a watchdog and Rohingya rights website run by Rohingya activists in Europe, said in a statement on Sunday.
The Myanmar government announced in a Facebook post on Saturday that a family of five had returned to the country from the border area between Bangladesh and Myanmar, where thousands of refugees are holed up.
About 700,000 Rohingya have fled to Bangladesh since Myanmar's military imposed a brutal crackdown on the Rohingya living in Rakhine State last August in what has been described as a ""textbook example of ethnic cleansing"" - an accusation Myanmar denies.
Images accompanying the social media post on Saturday showed five individuals receiving identification cards - which do not grant citizenship - from uniformed Myanmar officials, and getting medical help and living provisions from health and social workers.
The statement referred to the family as ""Muslims"". Myanmar does not recognise the Rohingya as an ethnic group. The statement also did not mention when and how many more individuals and families would be repatriated.
A Rohingya community leader confirmed to AFP news agency the return of the family.
According to the Rohingya Blogger, however, the individuals in the photos are the family members of the administrator of Taung Pyo Latya, the designated entry point for returning refugees.
""We were shocked to hear anybody would return here amidst volatile condition here,"" the Rohingya Blogger website quoted its source as saying.
The website claimed after conducting its own investigation that family entered the border area, where the refugees are camped out, to try ""persuade"" other Rohingya families to return to Myanmar.
The Rohingya Blogger site said that when the plan did not work, the family returned to Myanmar, where they were portrayed as ""returnees"".
The group described the announcement a ""fake event"", aimed at luring Rohingya refugees to return to Myanmar to live in camps.
Separately, Andrea Giorgetta from the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) told AFP that the repatriation announcement is ""a public relations exercise in an attempt to deflect attention from the need for accountability for crimes committed in Rakhine State"".
""Before proceeding with the repatriation of Rohingya, the Myanmar government must recognise and guarantee all their fundamental human rights,"" he told the news agency.
The reported repatriation comes days after Myanmar's social welfare minister, Win Myat Aye, visited a Rohingya camp in Bangladesh's border area of Cox's Bazar.
During the visit, Win announced that Myanmar is ready for the repatriation of Rohingya.
Ursula Mueller, the a UN senior humanitarian official, warned last week that there ""critical issues of freedom of movement"" that Myanmar's government needs to address before beginning repatriation, AFP reported.
On Friday, UNHCR said that the ""conditions in Myanmar are not yet conducive for returns to be safe, dignified and sustainable"", adding that ""the responsibility for creating such conditions remains with the Myanmar authorities, and these must go beyond the preparation of physical infrastructure to facilitate logistical arrangements.""
Bill Frelick, director of Human Rights Watch's (HRW) refugee rights programme, also recently called Myanmar's plan ""wishful thinking"".
""Before the start of actual returns, Myanmar should agree to a set of prerequisites for return,"" Frelick wrote earlier this month.
That includes ""unfettered, independent monitoring"" of returnees, restoration of lost homes and properties among others.
""Refugee return also cannot be divorced from the question of impunity for the crimes that caused the refugees to flee,"" he said.
In February, Bangladesh released a list of more than 8,000 Rohingya for repatriation. As of April 1, only 600 individuals have been verified by Myanmar, according to HRW.
A second list of 10,000 people is also being readied for release, Frelick said.
Rohingya and rights groups have accused the army of committing crimes against humanity and genocide, including murder, rape, arson and looting - unleashed in response to Rohingya armed attacks on security forces.
Since then, hundreds of thousands of Rohingya have been living in squalid conditions in camps along the Myanmar-Bangladesh border.
The Rohingya are viewed as one of the most persecuted communities in the world. Doctors Without Borders (MSF) estimated that at least 6,700 Rohingya were killed in the first month of the crackdown alone.

Al-Hawamdeh, 22, who has lost one of his legs to bone cancer, is climbing the world's tallest mountain to raise funding for the school that gave him an education.
Located in Jordan, the Al-Jufe School is run by the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian Refugees (UNRWA), which is currently facing severe budget shortfalls.
Al-Hawamdeh says his campaign is aimed at raising funding for the school, which is currently providing education to some 750 Palestinian refugees.
On crutches, al-Hawamdeh has already begun climbing the mountain, which is located near the Nepal-China border and reaches an altitude of 8,848 meters.
He has already climbed some 5,100 meters and hopes to soon reach the base camp located at the summit.
""Palestinian refugees have the right to realize their dreams,"" al-Hawamdeh told the Anadolu news agency. ""With this climb, I will prove that anything's possible.""
""By raising awareness, I hope to eventually raise $1m for the school that gave me my education,"" he said.
Al-Hawamdeh, who grew up in a refugee camp in Jordanian capital Amman, is Palestine's first licensed mountaineer with an artificial limb.
Last year, al-Hawamdeh climbed Africa's Mount Kilimanjaro to raise awareness about cancer victims.

That means for the foreseeable future at least Syria's President Bashar al-Assad seems set to continue his hold on power.
After seven years of war, the Syrian leader presides over a country that is a shadow of its former self.
Here we look at just how much death and destruction the country has experienced as a result of Assad's determination to hold on to the reins of power.
International organisations have had a hard time keeping up with just how many people Syria's civil war has left dead.
In March 2016, the UN's special envoy for Syria, Staffan de Mistura, estimated the death toll to be at around 400,000.
The number has increased significantly but nobody knows exactly by how much.
According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based monitor, the death toll could be as high as 511,000.
Syria's population before the start of the civil war stood at around 22 million people.
In the seven years since more than five million people have fled the country and another six million have become internally displaced, according to the UN.
The war has contributed to the largest refugee crisis since the end of the second world war and its effects are widely seen as driving the rise of the far right in Europe and the US.
The war has devastated Syria's economy and destroyed vast amounts of its infrastructure, including in major commercial centres, such as Aleppo and Raqqa.
At the end of 2013, the UN estimated that the war had cost Syria $143bn and that was before the rise of ISIL, and US, Russian, and other foreign intervention.
The Syrian pound has gone from just under 50 to the dollar in 2011 to 511 to the dollar today on official exchange markets.
Amnesty International estimates that at least 13,000 people were executed by the Syrian government in the first five years of the civil war in one prison alone.
Tens of thousands remain missing in Syria with no hint as to their fate.

More than 465,000 Syrians have been killed in the fighting, over a million injured, and over 12 million - half the country's prewar population - have been displaced.
Here is how and why the conflict started:
While lack of freedoms and economic woes drove resentment of the Syrian government, the harsh crackdown on protesters inflamed public anger.
Arab Spring: In 2011, successful uprisings - that became known as the Arab Spring - toppled Tunisia's and Egypt's presidents. This gave hope to Syrian pro-democracy activists.
That March, peaceful protests erupted in Syria as well, after 15 boys were detained and tortured for writing graffiti in support of the Arab Spring. One of the boys, a 13-year-old, was killed after having been brutally tortured.
The Syrian government, led by President Bashar al-Assad, responded to the protests by killing hundreds of demonstrators and imprisoning many more.
In July 2011, defectors from the military announced the formation of the Free Syrian Army, a rebel group aiming to overthrow the government, and Syria began to slide into civil war.
While the protests in 2011 were mostly non-sectarian, the armed conflict surfaced starker sectarian divisions. Most Syrians are Sunni Muslims, but Syria's security establishment has long been dominated by members of the Alawi sect, of which Assad is a member.
In 1982, Bashar's father ordered a military crackdown on the Muslim Brotherhood in Hama, killing tens of thousands of people and flattening much of the city.
Foreign backing and open intervention have played a large role in Syria's civil war. Russia entered the conflict in 2015 and has been the Assad government's main ally since then.
Regional actors: The governments of majority-Shia Iran and Iraq, and Lebanon-based Hezbollah, have supported Assad, while Sunni-majority countries, including Turkey, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia supported anti-Assad rebels.
Since 2016, Turkish troops have launched several operations against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL, also known as ISIS) near its borders, as well as against Kurdish groups armed by the United States.
Anti-ISIL coalition: The US has armed anti-Assad rebel groups and led an international coalition bombing ISIL targets since 2014.
Israel carried out air raids inside Syria, reportedly targeting Hezbollah and pro-government fighters and facilities.
The first time Syrian air defences shot down an Israeli warplane was in February 2018.
The US has repeatedly stated its opposition to the Assad government backed by Russia but has not involved itself as deeply.
Chemical red line: Former US President Barack Obama had warned that the use of chemical weapons in Syria was a ""red line"" that would prompt military intervention.
In April 2017, the US carried its first direct military action against Assad's forces, launching 59 Tomahawk cruise missiles at a Syrian air force base from which US officials believe a chemical attack on Khan Sheikhoun had been launched.
CIA training: In 2013, the CIA began a covert programme to arm, fund and train rebel groups opposing Assad, but the programme was later shut down after it was revealed that the CIA had spent $500m but only trained 60 fighters.
Russia's campaign: In September 2015, Russia launched a bombing campaign against what it referred to as ""terrorist groups"" in Syria, which included ISIL as well as anti-Assad rebel groups backed by the USA. Russia has also deployed military advisers to shore up Assad's defences.
At the UN Security Council, Russia and China have repeatedly vetoed Western-backed resolutions on Syria.
Peace negotiations have been ongoing between the Syrian government and the opposition in order to achieve a military ceasefire and political transition in Syria, but the main sticking point has been the fate of Assad.
Geneva: The first round of UN-facilitated talks between the Syrian government and opposition delegates took place in Geneva, Switzerland in June 2012.
In 2014 Staffan de Mistura replaced Kofi Annan as the UN special envoy for Syria.
Astana: In May 2017, Russia, Iran and Turkey called for the setup of four de-escalation zones in Syria, over which Syrian and Russian fighter jets were not expected to fly.
Sochi: In January 2018, Russia sponsored talks over the future of Syria in the Black Sea city of Sochi, but the opposition bloc boycotted the conference, claiming it was an attempt to undercut the UN effort to broker a deal.
Since the conflict began, as a Syrian rebellion against the Assad government, many new rebel groups have joined the fighting in Syria and have frequently fought one another.
The Free Syrian Army (FSA) is a loose conglomeration of armed brigades formed in 2011 by defectors from the Syrian army and civilians backed by the United States, Turkey, and several Gulf countries.
In December 2016, the Syrian army scored its biggest victory against the rebels when it recaptured the strategic city of Aleppo. Since then, the FSA has controlled limited areas in northwestern Syria.
In 2018, Syrian opposition fighters evacuated from the last rebel stronghold near Damascus. However, backed by Turkey, the FSA took control Afrin, near the Turkey-Syria border, from Kurdish rebel fighters seeking self-rule.
ISIL emerged in northern and eastern Syria in 2013 after overrunning large portions of Iraq. The group quickly gained international notoriety for its brutal executions and its energetic use of social media to recruit fighters from around the world.
Other groups fighting in Syria include Jabhat Fateh al-Sham, Iran-backed Hezbollah, and the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) dominated by the Kurdish People's Protection Units (YPG).
Fighting in Syria continues on several fronts:
Idlib: In February 2018, shelling by Russian and Syrian forces have intensified on Idlib, especially since fighters from the Hay'et Tahrir al-Sham group shot down a Russian warplane.
In April, Russia brokered a deal to evacuate opposition fighters from Eastern Ghouta in the south to Idlib in the north, Idlib being one of the few strongholds controlled by opposition fighters.
The province is strategically important for the Syrian government and Russia for its proximity to the Russian-operated Syrian Khmeimim airbase.
Homs: In April, an airbase and other Syrian government facilities in Homs became again the target of Israeli and US-led air strikes in which UK and French forces also participated.
The Syrian army recaptured the city of Homs in 2014, but fighting continues with rebels in the suburbs between Homs and Hama.
Afrin: Turkey and the Free Syrian Army (FSA) began in January 2018 a military operation against US-backed fighters in northwestern Syria, and announced the capture of Afrin's city centre in March.

Now having gone on longer than World War II, the war in Syria is causing profound effects beyond the country's borders, with many Syrians having left their homes to seek safety elsewhere in Syria or beyond.
Registered: As of February 2018, the UN refugee agency (UNHCR) had registered over 5.5 million refugees from Syria and estimated that there are over 6.5 million internally displaced persons (IDP) within Syria's borders.
Lebanon, Turkey, and Jordan are hosting most of the Syrian refugees, many of whom attempt to journey onwards to Europe in search of better conditions.
The 1951 Geneva Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees describes a refugee as any person who, ""owing to well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, is outside the country of his nationality and is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country"".
Returns: In 2017, about 66,000 refugees returned to Syria, according to reports.

As a child, May had several aliases and was always on the move to protect her from kidnapping or assassination.
If her true identity was close to being revealed, she would be given a new passport, a new nationality, a new name and a new backstory.
""I always had to hide my true background, mainly from the Israelis,"" May explains as we sit down at a cafe in Beirut's bustling Harma district.
These may seem like drastic measures, but they make more sense if you are the daughter of Fusako Shigenobu, founder of the Japanese Red Army (JRA).
Fusako arrived in Lebanon in 1971 without a word of Arabic in her lexicon, but soon managed to make her intentions crystal clear. She was there to offer support to the Palestinian struggle.
It was in Lebanon that Shigenobu founded the JRA, a Marxist-Leninist organisation seeking the overthrow of the Japanese government, the destruction of capitalism and imperialism, and the start of a worldwide revolution.
It was the emphasis on internationalism that drove Shigenobu to align with the Palestinian cause.
Her small but dedicated group of Japanese revolutionaries struck up an organisational relationship with the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) who at that time had a strong presence throughout Lebanon, including in the Palestinian refugee camps surrounding Beirut.
Once established, the JRA became involved in a series of high-profile international operations including aircraft hijackings and hostage-takings.
The strategy was designed to draw attention to the Palestinian cause, which had suffered devastating defeats in 1948 and 1967. It was in the midst of this campaign that baby May was born.
May's father was also a leader of the PFLP at that time, but she avoids identifying him for security reasons.
""It's not like it was 100 years ago; a lot of people would still be affected by unnecessary information going out,"" May said.
""You might be surprised but in general people didn't know about specific members of this organisation.
""My mother took on the Arab name Mariam, but very few ever knew who Mariam was or what her real name was.
""It wasn't like I was the daughter of a famous person. But I was the daughter of a famous organisation. And I feel proud and lucky to have had a whole community of these idealistic, self-sacrificing people around me, raising me.""
Despite being surrounded by people deeply involved in the struggle, May says it was safer for her and for everyone, that she remained in the dark about the specifics of their activities.
""As a child, I didn't know much.""
May, now a freelance journalist and TV producer, says: ""That was mostly for security reasons.
""You never know which situation I might be in where I could mistakenly say something or get lured into saying something.
""I knew who the people around me were, and what they were fighting for, but I didn't know the details.""
The details have been reported as including an attack on the Israeli Lod Airport in 1972 by three Japanese gunmen which left 22 people dead.
The only person involved in the attack to survive, Kozo Okamoto, was imprisoned by Israel before being released in a prisoner swap in 1985.
He lives in Beirut to this day and remains the only person to have ever been granted political asylum in Lebanon.
While most media at the time reported the attack as an early act by the JRA, this narrative is disputed by May who says it came before the formation of the organisation.
""At the time there was no such thing as the Japanese Red Army. It was carried out by activists from different leftist movements in Japan who wanted to act in solidarity with the Palestinians,"" she says.
Nevertheless, there are many who would condemn her mother and her comrades as ""terrorists"" responsible for the deaths of civilians. Again, May says this is due to a false portrayal of the group propagated by sections of the media.
""Firstly, their military actions were quite rightly always intended to avoid harming civilians and they were successful in this,"" she responds, with little hesitation.
""Secondly, whether you are a terrorist or a freedom fighter depends on which side you are on. It doesn't have a clear definition.
""Nelson Mandela was considered a terrorist at one time, Gandhi was considered a terrorist at one time. But are they terrorists today? Of course not. History has recognised them as leaders and heroes of their nation. How history defines you all depends on if you win or lose in the struggle.""
Nevertheless, May believes the tactics employed by the JRA are no longer necessary in today's world. There are other ways to spread the message and support struggles.
""In the past, we didn't have the connectivity that we have today - we didn't have the internet, we didn't have satellite television and we didn't have social media,"" she argues.
""It was very difficult for activists to spread the word about the struggle they wanted to convey to people around the world.
""For them to be able to attract attention and inform others, they had to do drastic things. To get the cameras or the microphones attending to their cause and asking about it. It didn't matter if they were criticised in the report; it would give a platform to talk about the things they were fighting for.
""Today you don't need to use armed struggle in all locations unless it's a location that is under direct occupation, where people need to have all sorts of options to resist as is their right under the United Nations.""
In July 2000, Fusako Shigenobu returned to Japan under a fake identity, checking into a hotel under a man's name.
However, her cover was blown and she was arrested by the Japanese police amid great media fanfare.
She was sentenced to 20-years in prison for orchestrating the 1974 siege of the French embassy in The Hague, a conviction May says was achieved on the basis of flimsy evidence.
May travels back to Japan regularly to see her mother but is pessimistic about the chances of her being out before her 2023 release date.
""I would love her to be released early but they want to keep her as long as possible. Societies usually move on but in terms of Japan it is a very different country - it's not a place where they hope for social rehabilitation.""
May's life has been shaped by those days of struggle in the 1970s. She grew up without a proper childhood. She was forced to disappear and lose touch with any friends she made and her elderly mother is serving a long sentence in jail.
If she felt a bit bitter at the hand she was drawn in life, it would be understandable. But there is not a hint of it.
""I believe in the need to continue for the same cause,"" she argues.
""The Japanese Red Army were internationalists. If this movement was still active today, it would be supporting the civil rights movement in the US, or the oppression that the people of Rohingya are facing in Myanmar.
""Their idea of supporting people who are facing injustice and discrimination is still right even today. Most of the time the world is not kind to activists and people who are fighting against the system, but we need to think of the people who are truly in need of their support.
""Every action, however small, still matters and makes a difference.""
Time may have passed, and tactics may have changed, but there's no doubt that May Shigenobu remains committed to the same cause as her mother. She is, after all, a child of the revolution.

On Friday, the Greek police said that 1,658 refugees and migrants were detained in March after crossing into Greece through the Evros River, which is situated on the Turkish border.
That number was more than five times higher than the same period in 2017, which saw only 262 people detained on the country's frontier with Turkey, the Greek daily Ekathimerini reported.
The new data comes just two months after the Greek Council for Refugees published a report alleging that Greek authorities were increasingly conducting ""systematic pushbacks"" in the Evros region.
Eva Cosse, a researcher at Human Rights Watch (HRW), said pushbacks are considered a violation of both international refugee law and human rights law.
""We've been monitoring the issue of pushbacks,"" Cosse told Al Jazeera.
""Pushbacks at sea stopped when the [Syriza] government came to power [in January 2015], but pushbacks on land have never really stopped,"" she added.
""People should have the opportunity to seek asylum but pushing back people can put them in danger.""
While Greece has been widely criticised for pushbacks and the declining humanitarian conditions for tens of thousands of asylum seekers trapped in camps, migration minister Dimitris Vitsas has defended the government's approach to the crisis.
""One of our central priorities for the immediate future is the implementation of major infrastructure projects in the islands, in cooperation with the local government, aiming at enhancing everyday life of the inhabitants who are in the front line during the ongoing refugee crisis,"" he recently told reporters.
Vitsas added that the Greek government ""will continue to vigorously defend the values of humanity and solidarity"".
Yonous Muhammadi, head of the Greek Forum of Refugees, also said the number of people crossing via Evros is ""increasing"".
""We have people coming four or five times, entering Greece and then being pushed back to Turkey,"" he told Al Jazeera by telephone.
Describing the land route as ""dangerous"", Muhammadi cited a string of reported deaths along the Evros River, where rising waters made the journey perilous.
Meanwhile, the number of refugees and migrants reaching Greek islands by crossing the Mediterranean Sea from Turkey was ostensibly on the rise again.
According to the UN refugee agency (UNHCR), more than 16,595 people have reached European shores by making the perilous journey across the Mediterranean so far this year.
During that period, at least 501 people died or went missing, UNHCR noted.
Between January and March, one person out of every 14 crossing the Mediterranean died, compared with one death in every 29 people who made that journey during the first three months of 2017, the UN recently said.
On March 17, a boat carrying refugees capsized en route to Greece from Turkey. The Greek coastguard subsequently found 16 bodies, among them children.

But Muzoon, 20, is no ordinary girl. For the past five years, living as a refugee, she spearheaded a campaign to promote the right of refugee children to an education. She kicked her mission off at the age of 14 in a refugee camp in Jordan, after several of her schoolmates dropped out of school to be married off as child brides.
""When we fled Syria, we had to leave everything behind. My father told me to take only what I needed the most. I took my books, they were my only hope,"" Muzoon told Al Jazeera.
""I thought: Wherever we go, what will happen if I cannot go to school? My books were the only thing that could give me a future.""
Her pale, inquisitive face, encircled by a hijab, shows a calm determination as she steps into the meeting room. She is in Geneva to speak about the right of refugee children to choose and shape their future, a right only education can grant, she said.
""Education is the only thing that matters. It is the only thing that can empower us and change our condition. Without education we cannot have any future,"" Muzoon said.
""We need to be educated if we want to rebuild our country. We owe it to Syria.""
A short leather jacket and jeans betray a youth cut abruptly short for a girl who today represents more than five million Syrian children who have been displaced over seven years of conflict. Like many of them, Muzoon has witnessed too much, too early for her age.
""When you lose everything, from your beloved ones to your home, it is difficult to think that education matters. But it does. Especially for us girls who are the most vulnerable of all.""
According to the UN agencies, some 43 percent of Syrian refugee children in Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan and Iraq are out of school.
Poverty and dwindling financial means are making it almost impossible for families to get by in these countries. In a recent study conducted by UNICEF Jordan, more than 85 percent of refugees outside the camps - in host communities - live in poverty, struggling to meet their basic needs, including providing education for their children.
But it is difficult to envisage an improvement in the life and prospects of Syrian refugee children. As the war becomes further protracted, the prospect of returning to a normal life for the 2.6 million Syrians in neighbouring countries and the 2.8 million internally displaced remains unrealistic. An entire generation of Syrians has apparently lost the opportunity to receive an education because of the war.
""There has been a total disregard for the protection of children by all sides in this conflict,"" said Christophe Boulierac, UNICEF spokesperson, on Tuesday. ""We keep calling upon all the parties in the conflict to do what they must to protect children as per the international law.""
The first two months of this year have been especially bloody for children in Syria. UNICEF received reports of more than 1,000 children killed and seriously wounded since the year began. In 2017 alone, UNICEF registered 1,271 verified child casualties in Syria, of which 361 were injuries and 910 deaths.
Some 961 children were recruited in combat.
Meanwhile, in refugee host countries nearly 10,000 Syrian refugee children are either unaccompanied or separated from their families. Many of these children are vulnerable to exploitation and child labour, because of a lack of legal documentation.
Left without any hope, as Syrians find themselves displaced multiple times, many families marry off their daughters as child brides to protect them from being kidnapped and abused, or to save them from poverty and starvation. Child marriage was uncommon in Syria before the war started, Muzoon said.
""I remember a 17-year-old girl, who came to tell me that she was to marry a man older than her father. I told her to convince her parents that an education would have given her a better future than a husband,"" she recalled. ""I told her to be brave. She didn't get married in the end and went back to school.""
Muzoon campaigned relentlessly for three years in the Zaatari and Azraq refugee camps in Jordan, where her family had fled to from Deraa after their neighbourhood was caught in the middle of clashes between government forces and the Free Syrian Army.
""In Syria, we had a normal, happy life. We had everything. Suddenly we found ourselves in a refugee camp. I hated it.""
Life in the camp was difficult, recalled Muzoon. Her family had to squeeze into a small tent with no running water or electricity. But she ""didn't want to be negative"", she said, so she looked for a school in order not to miss ninth grade.
""Nobody would tell us to go to school. It was totally voluntary, so many kids were not going or dropped out. So I started visiting the tents of the camps to publicise the school and encouraging children to join.""
She was often scorned and sent away by parents and children alike, who thought marriage was their only way out of poverty.
""I knew how they felt, the horror and pain they had gone through, the events they witnessed are something they couldn't forget. For many of them education seemed an irrelevant thing.""
But many children went back to school thanks to her encouragement. UNICEF supported Muzoon in her mission and made her the agency's youngest goodwill ambassador last year.
Geert Cappelaere, UNICEF's regional director for the Middle East and North Africa, has called on those fighting inside Syria and all those who have influence over them to put their arms down and stop the war on children.
""The children of Syria have been waiting for way too long. The world has failed the children of Syria so many times, it cannot keep failing them. History will judge us all if we do,"" Cappelaere said.

With more than 93 percent of the votes in Sunday's poll counted, Orban's increasingly far-right Fidesz party was in first with nearly half the vote, the National Election Office said.
The result is expected to hand Orban a third successive term in power.
Orban's nearest rival was Gabor Vona, of Jobbik party, with 20 percent. The Socialists, led by Gergely Karacsony was third, with 12 percent of the vote.
Turnout stood at 68.80 percent, higher than the final turnout of 61.73 percent in the last election in 2014, which gave Orban a landslide victory.
""Dear friends, there's a big battle behind us, we secured a historic victory - we got a chance, we created a chance for us to protect Hungary,"" Orban told a crowd of cheering supporters in the capital, Budapest on Sunday evening.
""The high voter turnout puts every doubt into brackets,"" he added.
Following his election defeat, Vona, chairman of Jobbik, tendered his resignation.
The Socialists leaders also resigned, saying: ""We regard ourselves responsible for what happened, [and] we have acknowledged the decision of voters"".
Jonah Hull, reporting from Budapest, said Orban's election victory result was ""the fruition of a particularly nasty"" and ""hate-based, xenophobic campaign"".
""It has basically been a single-issue campaign, based on the spectrum of the 'invading hordes of Muslim refugees' being held back by a fence that he's built on the southern border,"" said Hull.
""He paints himself as a sort of saviour of Hungary from the refugees.""
Noting that the main opposition party in Hungary was Jobbik, ""a formerly - until very recently - staunchly far-right, anti-immigrant party with neo-Nazi roots"", Hull said that ""the era of populist, staunchly right-wing nationalism and xenophobia in the country is far from over"".
With far-right and populist parties making gains in a spate of recent European elections, including in Italy and Austria, analysts have speculated that Orban's anti-migrant and ""illiberal"" policies could have long-lasting implications for the European Union (EU).
Ahead of the vote, the prime minister had called on voters to ""save Hungary"".
Orban's campaign has focused largely on issues like migration and George Soros, the Hungarian American billionaire and philanthropist who Fidesz accuses of encouraging refugees to flood the central European country.
""This is a political strategy of the governing party,"" Bulcsu Hunyadi, a senior analyst at the Political Capital Institute think-tank, told Al Jazeera.
""They think these are the only topics with which they can dominate the discussion.""
Matthew Goodwin, professor of politics and international relations at the University of Kent, said the ""strong result"" by Orban's party would be ""greeted by the populist right in Europe and also much of the centre-right who want to see Hungary, Poland, Austria and Italy pushing back against the EU on the big issue of the refugee crisis and push Europe in a more conservative direction.""
He added that earlier on Sunday there was speculation over a potential backlash against Orban's policies given the high turnout figures, but the results showed that Fidesz had actually picked up more support in rural, non-urban areas.
""That's part of a European trend, with populists, conservatives and ultra-conservative politicians doing very well outside of the big cities,"" Goodwin told Al Jazeera.
""Orban himself really successfully tapped into what is a very conservative political tradition in Hungary,"" he added, arguing that western European leaders such as French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel ""continue to underestimate the strength of conservative currents in Eastern Europe"".

But when the man who jumped over the wall before him broke his leg, Zahidi was forced to rethink his move. That night his depression worsened.
Zahidi was not a criminal but has been a prisoner for two years without a sentence or a release date. The boy from Afghanistan's Ghazni province is one of 151 refugees, mostly ethnic Hazara, who fled persecution in their country.
They have been locked up in a detention centre in Balikpapan on the Indonesian island of Borneo.
Indonesia has not signed the UN Refugee Convention and considers them illegal immigrants. Despite a 2016 presidential decree to provide them temporary housing, more than a 1,000 are still behind bars across Indonesia.
Every day for the past 80 days, these refugees in Balikpapan - far away from the capital Jakarta - have been shouting the same slogans and holding the same signs: ""We want freedom, immigration release us, we are humans, we are exhausted.""
But their tired voices are echoing against the huge walls lined with barbed wire. Their only audience is a handful of prison guards.
When Al Jazeera managed to get access to the prison, the refugees could barely control their emotions.
His eyes full of tears, Rasul Dad, the oldest in the prison at 60, said he would keep looking at the sky all day, imagining how it would feel like to be free.
Dad suffers from kidney problems. He said the pain was often unbearable.
""We are desperate,"" Ehsanullah Sahil, another refugee, said.
""When we escaped persecution, beheadings and discrimination, we hoped to find asylum. We looked for safety, not to be locked up behind bars.""
Nearly 14,000 refugees from Afghanistan, Somalia, Iraq and other countries have been stuck in Indonesia for up to a decade.
They were hoping to be resettled in Australia, the US or somewhere in Europe. But since a lot of countries have all but closed their borders to refugees, lives are in a limbo in Indonesia: Locked up, not allowed to work or provide their children with education.
The refugees have been under increasing pressure to return to their countries. So far, 46 refugees who could not bear to be locked up any longer, have returned to Afghanistan.
The International Organization for Migration (IOM) gave them $2,000, an amount provided by the Australian government.
""When the IOM came here, they offered money to those who could not stand their detention any longer,"" Sahil added.
""None of us can take this any longer, of course. But we can't go back either. We have escaped. They can't send us back to the warzone.""
Several refugees have tried committing suicide, according to the director of the detention centre Irham Anwar.
""We realise they should not be detained. We have asked the local government to provide housing but it seems they are worried a religious conflict could happen,"" Anwar said.
When conservative Muslim groups in majority-Sunni Balikpapan found out the refugees were Shia Muslims, they rejected their presence.
A special taskforce at the security ministry in Jakarta dealing with refugees has been urging local governments to provide housing as soon as possible.
But so far only several regions have come through.
""It's clear that we can't accept refugees. Our country has too many problems to deal with,"" said Carlo Tewu, head of the task force.
""We'll provide them with temporary housing but urge the UNHCR to resettle all of them as soon as possible.""
More than 1,500km away, the refugees continue to scream and cry for help.
""We are humans, please help us,"" said the sign Zahidi was carrying.
But it's a cry falling on deaf ears so far.

Law Number 10, introduced earlier this week, calls on Syrians to register their private properties with the Ministry of Local Administration within 30 days.
Titleholders must either provide proof of ownership documents themselves, or ensure a relative does so on their behalf. Otherwise, they face having to relinquish their properties to the state.
According to Article 2 of the law, a regulatory body will be responsible for drawing up a list of real estate owners - conditional on receiving documentation in support of ownership claims - for areas under government control.
Properties that are not reclaimed by their owners within the month-long period will otherwise become part of a plan to reorganise the areas they belong to into new residential zones.
But with about 13 million Syrians, internally or externally displaced and therefore unable to access their lands, many families face the potential of losing their homes forever.
""This law can effectively deprive millions of Syrians of their lands and properties,"" said Nizar Ayoub, an international lawyer and expert on conflict resolution.
""It is the latest in a series of measures taken by the state to punish those who have opposed the Assad government by denying them their rights to their lands,"" added Ayoub, founder of Al-Marsad, the Arab Centre for Human Rights in Golan Heights.
Legal experts have been quick to liken the recently introduced legislation to the Israeli Absentees' Property Law.
That law was brought in after the 1948 war to allow arriving Israelis to move into the homes of millions of Palestinians forced off their lands.
""Just like the 'Absentees Law' allowed Israelis to take over the properties of Palestinians forced off their lands in 1948, Assad's new law could see the state confiscating the lands of millions of displaced and refugee Syrians,"" said Ayoub.
In recent years, the Absentees' Law has been used by right-wing groups seeking to increase Jewish presence in East Jerusalem, which is traditionally dominated by Arab neighbourhoods.
The move by Assad's government comes just days after the latest batch of about 19,000 Syrians left their homes in Eastern Ghouta for the northern province of Idlib following two evacuation deals reached with the Russian army in March.
Nizar Ayoub, international lawyer
""This law is simply an extension to the enforced evacuations which aim to empty opposition areas of its rightful owners and give these lands to Assad,"" said Abu Jawad, one the thousands of Syrians who fled their homes in Eastern Ghouta in recent weeks.
""It is impossible for me to go back home to prove my right to my lands and properties,"" the 27-year-old, who owns two homes and an electronics shop in Hammouria, told Al Jazeera.
""If I attempt to do so, I'll either be killed or arrested by pro-government forces,"" added Abu Jawad who fled to the northwestern province of Idlib earlier this month.
To date, an estimated 150,000 residents of Eastern Ghouta have been evacuated to northern Syria.
The government says the new law aims to address the issue of squatter areas and the reconstruction of lands impacted by war.
Experts argue, however, that it aims to punish those who have opposed Assad as well as create demographic changes on the ground in Syria.
""It is completely illogical that a law which aims to rebuild Syria and repopulate areas affected by the war is introduced while the war is still ongoing,"" Diala Shehade, a human rights lawyer, told Al Jazeera.
""Carrying out this transitional phase of reconstruction and re-population before addressing the issue [that] millions of Syrian are refugees or internally displaced, points towards the ill intentions of the Assad government,"" she added.
Ayoub agrees: ""The most dangerous thing about this law is that it has been issued in the midst of the ongoing armed conflict, and as millions of Syrians are unable to return to their homes to prove ownership of their properties,"" he told Al Jazeera.
According to Ayoub, the law may, therefore, play into what has been described as a plan to change the demographics of Syria, which according to reports since 2015 has seen Shia communities from across Syria, Lebanon and Iraq resettle in areas previously inhabited by Sunnis who were forced to leave their homes.
Population exchanges have reportedly been key to a plan to make demographic changes to parts of the country.
The goal, some have argued, is to enable the government and its allies to pursue their strategic interests even further by creating specific areas under their direct control.
""If we take Eastern Ghouta as an example, the thousands of families who are now displaced for opposing Assad might be replaced by people who have supported him instead,"" said Ayoub.

Fishermen in East Aceh, on the northern tip of Sumatra, brought two men, two women, and a child to safety while unconfirmed media reports said five others had died.
""They reached land at around 1:30am and were immediately taken to hospital,"" said Razali, a senior navy official based in eastern Aceh.
It was not immediately clear where the boat had originated. Rights groups have said they are expecting many more refugees from Myanmar to attempt the dangerous sea crossings.
Tens of thousands of Rohingya fled Myanmar by sea following an outbreak of violence in Rakhine State in 2012.
Last year, according to UN and other rights groups, some 700,000 Rohingya fled their homes in Rakhine State into Bangladesh after the military responded to militia attacks in August with a crackdown that the UN and Western countries have said constitutes ""ethnic cleansing"".
Indonesia usually takes in asylum seekers arriving by boat but they have limited rights and many end up spending years in refugee camps and detention centres.
Earlier this week, neighbouring Malaysia intercepted a boat off Langkawi island carrying 56 Rohingya from Myanmar.

https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/04/central-americans-vow-continue-mexico-disperses-caravan-180404023901442.html,refugee,1036,Wed Apr 04 2018 04:36:59 GMT+0000,Maya Averbuch,Central Americans vow to continue as Mexico disperses 'caravan',"Oaxaca, Mexico - After a series of fiery tweets by US President Donald Trump and heightened media attention, the Mexican government has announced it will disperse the Refugee Caravan of more than a thousand individuals fleeing violence and other harsh conditions in Central America, prompting many to vow to continue north.
""They cannot continue travelling illegally,"" said JO Rodriguez, the federal representative in Oaxaca of Mexico's National Migration Institute.
""You cannot negotiate with the law,"" Rodriguez told Al Jazeera.
The government said it would issue one-year humanitarian visas to the most vulnerable, allow others to submit applications within the month to stay in Mexico, and request that the rest exit the country within 20 days.
Many of those travelling with the caravan said they will continue with the aim of reaching the United States, while others have said they will remain in other parts of Mexico.
Kevin, 16, from Tegucigalpa, Honduras, said that a local gang, Barrio 18, had tried to forcibly recruit him, and that they had threatened to harm his entire family if he did not become a member. He plans to request asylum in the US.
""Young people who have experienced the same thing have been killed,"" he told Al Jazeera.
""The president thinks we're all delinquents,"" he added. ""But we're going to continue with the caravan as far as it goes.""
The decision by the Mexican government came after Trump sent out a series of tweets on Sunday and Monday, saying Congress should ""use Nuclear Option if necessary, to stop the massive inflow of Drugs and People"".
He lamented what he considers to be lax border laws that allow people to enter the US and claimed that Mexico ""has the absolute power to not let these large 'Caravans' of people enter their country"".
On Monday, the offices of the Mexican Secretary of Government and the Secretary of Foreign Affairs released a joint statement in which they said that, this year, the authorities would offer refugee status to select individuals from the caravan for the first time since similar movements started in 2010.
But it asserted that the Mexican government makes its immigration decisions in a sovereign manner, and it is not responsible for regulating the legal entry of people to other countries.
""It is not up to this government to make immigration decisions for the United States or any other nation,"" the statement reads.
Mexico has received funding from the US for training and equipment for its southern border since 2014, and it collaborated with USAID on a six-month project in 2017 to discourage Central Americans from leaving their countries by improving forensics practices, trade-related transparency, and jobs training. Last year, it deported 80,000 people - the majority of whom were from Central America.
The annual pilgrimage began at the start of pre-Easter Holy Week when participants rose before dawn each morning to walk north, held out cut-off Coke bottles to request change from passing cars, and prepared to board freight trains, many of them with the aim of reaching the US.
The storm around the Refugee Caravan, which for the past several years brought together people who are fleeing from El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, occurred in part because of the scale of this year's movement.
Many of the participants came from Honduras, where the disputed elections in November led to weeks of street protests and a government-imposed curfew. It was a tipping point for the country, which has been plagued by limited job opportunities and gangs who, since the 1990s, have maintained ruthless control over select neighbourhoods.
For the people on the ground, the series of disputes has led to uncertainty about their future destination.
Though about 300 members of the caravan boarded freight trains last week, the majority of the group has remained in a park in Matias Romero, Oaxaca.
They tied tarps to the fence to protect themselves from the sun and cooked with pots perched on top of concrete blocks, as they waited for an answer about where they should go.
""It's going to be impossible for us to arrive to the border with 1,000 people,"" said Irineo Mujica, the director of Pueblo Sin Fronteras.
""But since we're refugees, they should treat us like refugees,"" Mujica said to the crowd.
They intend to reach the state of Puebla for consultations with a group of Mexican and American lawyers at the end of the week.
For many of the people who have remained in the park, the dream has remained to go to the US.
Bessy, 37, who travelled with her eight-year-old daughter, Natalie, and son, Alejandro, 14, said that for the past 13 years, her family that owned a business selling chicken, were forced to pay a local gang 1,500 lempiras (about $63) every two weeks.
When the gang demanded that she pay 500 lempiras (about $21) extra, she could not come up with the money. She feared their retribution because they killed her brother three years ago, but she was unsure on Monday whether to request a Mexican permit.
""Trump is treating us as though we were terrorists,"" said Jorge Luis, who is from Honduras.
He remained wary of the Mexican government's immigration officials promise to give people papers immediately. ""I hope that they comply with what they're promising us, instead of leaving us like brides at the altar.""
JO Rodriguez, the INM official who was overseeing the lines of people formed to place their names on lists for each kind of permit, said that Mexico's refugee office would not be able to absorb all of the people fleeing from threats, for which reason many of the single men would be asked to leave the country.
Christopher Gascon, the Mexico representative of the International Organization for Migration, confirmed that the exit permits, known as oficios de salida, do not stipulate from which border people must leave Mexico.
""The caravan is not over,"" said Alex Mensing, a coordinator with Pueblo Sin Fronteras.
""There's some people that will advance on their own, but the essence of the caravan - to seek refuge - will not change.""
Editor's note: Al Jazeera has withheld the last names of those on the caravan to protect their identities.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu faced intense pressure from right-wing groups which oppose the agreement, which would have let at least 16,000 Africans stay, and another 16,000 resettled in Western countries.
Al Jazeera's Stefanie Dekker reports from Tel Aviv."
https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/04/africans-israel-voice-concern-resettlement-plan-180402231149650.html,refugee,906,Tue Apr 03 2018 07:52:05 GMT+0000,Mersiha Gadzo,Africans in Israel voice concern over new resettlement plan,"African asylum seekers in Israel have voiced concern over Tel Aviv’s agreement with the UN to resettle half of them in Western countries.
A number of African migrants and asylum seekers told Al Jazeera they remain sceptical that the new plan could bring any real change for those who are to stay in Israel.
On Monday Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office announced that Israel had reached an unprecedented understanding with the United Nations to help resettle at least 16,250 African migrants in “developed countries like Canada, or Germany and Italy,” instead of Africa.
Hours after the announcement, Netanyahu said he would suspend the new plan, which was denounced by right-wingers in his government.
Netanyahu wrote in a Facebook post on Monday night that he was putting the agreement on hold until he meets with representatives from south Tel Aviv - where a large number of African asylum seekers live - along with Interior Minister Arye Dery.
Confusing matters further, both the German embassy in Israel and the Italian foreign ministry reported to the media that they were not aware of receiving any requests regarding asylum seekers.
Guess it's just one of those days. At 20:57 you congratulate #Israel & @refugees on their agreement, at 21:46 you like @IsraelMFA announcement on the deal, at 22:50 the PM suspends it and blames, among others, #EU (where #UNHCR hoped to resettle significant number of refugees).
The new deal would allow those who stay in Israel, mainly women and children to be able to apply for asylum.
“As part of this agreement, they will all receive a visa so that they will be able to stay in Israel with a legal status and that is very important,” William Spindler, spokesperson for UNHCR told Al Jazeera following the announcement of the agreement.
“They will be able to apply for asylum if they are in fear of persecution in their countries of origin; their cases would need to be assessed.
“What we must remember is in the case of Eritreans for instance, a very high proportion of them are recognised as refugees in Europe, over 90 percent,” Spindler said.
“In the case of Sudanese, their proportion is also very high. So we think that most of these asylum seekers will qualify for refugee status.”
Journalist David Sheen criticised the deal for merely postponing the expulsion of the remaining non-Jewish African refugees in Israel.
Responding to complaints from his far-right base, that even only having to postpone the expulsion, of only 16,000 non-Jewish African refugees, & for only 5 years, is still a capitulation, Netanyahu issues new vow to try to reduce even those 5 years to less https://t.co/3u7qZdN5uH pic.twitter.com/bCO9RWkvZP
“Just like the shady Rwanda & Uganda deals, this UN deal is no ‘victory’ for African refugees. 16,000 men will get chances at normal lives – which is more than they get in Israel – but the remaining 24,000 will have to start over with nothing in five years time,” Sheen wrote.
“And for the five years until those remaining refugees are forced out, they will lack the communal support of their resettled brethren, and become even more vulnerable targets for violent vigilante attacks, egged on by Israeli leaders. Reports of the ‘deal’ make no mention of any public campaign to reverse their racist incitement.”
Sheen's concerns were echoed by many African asylum seekers.
“They are always changing their policies, so your happiness will only be for a short time,” said Helen Kidane, 27, just after the deal was announced, unknowingly foreshadowing Netanyahu’s revoked decision.
Kidane, who fled Eritrea in 2011 told Al Jazeera from Tel Aviv that lack of security and public services for African refugees remains unaddressed.
“We’re still scared; we don’t have any guarantees whether this [deal] will be implemented or not.
“They are making our lives miserable- financially and psychologically through their policies. Financially, they are taking 34 percent of salaries from refugees… but there has been no public service [available] to any refugee here since we arrived,” Kidane said, noting that her child was born in Israel but is still treated the same as other refugees.
Africans started fleeing to Israel in 2005 after word spread of safe refuge and job opportunity in Israel. Tens of thousands crossed the desert border before Israel completed the barrier at the Egyptian border in 2012 to curb the influx.
Fria, 32, whose name has been changed for fear of reprisal, fled Sudan after her family members were killed and escaped to Israel in 2011, crossing the desert alone by foot.
Living in Israel as an African refugee has been difficult due to prevalent racism; she has endured verbal abuse and Israelis have thrown things at her such as eggs and soft drinks.
Fria stressed that the deal reached with the UN allocates residency rights temporarily for only five years, after which they would face the same problem again. In the meantime, they continue to live in difficult conditions.
“All the families that live here, they don’t have good status… even those who were born here, they have no health insurance,” Fria said. “The government doesn’t provide [basic] things for children here. Families are facing a lot of problems.
“We don’t have the same health insurance as the Israelis. Even if we paid from [our own pocket], we won’t get good treatment. … If someone is sick and he went to the emergency, they will not treat him.”

The government of Nauru - a Pacific island on which hundreds of asylum seekers are detained in an Australian immigration facility - said on Monday that no new judicial appeals to Australia's High Court would be permitted under the now defunct 1976 High Court Appeals Act.
Julie Bishop, Australia's foreign minister, confirmed on Monday that Nauru had informed government officials in December of its intention to scrap the 1976 appeals act.
""Australia supports Nauru's sovereignty and its December 2017 decision to terminate the treaty in advance of the nation's 50th anniversary of independence,"" she said in a statement to reporters.
The agreement was formally terminated on March 12, according to Australia's Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, though news of the severence has only emerged in recent days after Nauru's solicitor-general reportedly made comments on Friday concerning the act's abolishment.
Critics have said the move could have adverse consequences for asylum seekers being detained on Nauru, who could be left without the right to appeal, and accuse Australia of exploiting the island's decision for reasons of ""political expediency"".
""Australia needs Nauru to solve its refugee problem, and as a consequence it is completely compromised by its desire not to offend the Nauruan government,"" George Newhouse, a human rights lawyer for Australia's National Justice Project, told Al Jazeera on Monday.
""[But] there are serious problems in the processing of asylum seeker reviews on Nauru … [and] these are life and death decisions because an asylum seeker that has their claim rejected could find themselves returned back to harm or even death,"" he said.
Australia's top court presided over at least 13 appeals from Nauru last year, according to Jeremy Gans, a professor of law at the University of Melbourne, Australia, having only decided on five cases from the Pacific island in the preceding 40 years of the act's existence.
Under its strict border control policies, Australia sends asylum seekers who arrive by boat to processing centres the government manages in the Pacific and permanently bans those individuals from settling in the country.
According to the Australian Border Force, 1,111 of those asylum seekers are detained on Nauru and Manus Island, part of Papua New Guinea.
Attempted suicide among asylum seekers is rife in Nauru because of the prison-like conditions they face in indefinite detention, an Amnesty International report released in 2016 said.
Malcolm Turnbull, Australia's prime minister, rejected the report, saying the government's commitment to dealing with those detained was ""compassionate and strong"".
Australia, Nauru's largest aid donor, will provide it with $19m of ""official development assistance"" this year alone, according to Australia's Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.
On Monday, Nauru's government defended its decision to scrap the appeals act in a series of Twitter posts saying it will ""not accept interference in our domestic affairs"".
""As a sovereign nation with a democratically (re) elected government, we will make decisions based on what is best for our people, not what ill-informed, racist, elitist, colonial-minded Australian lawyers, journalists and activists try and demand,"" the government said via its Twitter account.
""Nauru's justice system is independent and transparent, and our judges - all from outside Nauru - are highly respected.""
As a sovereign nation with a democratically (re)elected government, we will make decisions based on what is best for our people, not what ill-informed, racist, elitist, colonial-minded Australian lawyers, journalists & activists try & demand...2/3
The government of Nauru is yet to respond to Al Jazeera's request for comment, but officials have previously said all cases filed before Nauru gave notice to Australia of its intention to abolish the appeals act will proceed unhindered to the Australian High Court.
News of the severence has only emerged in recent days after Jay Udit, Nauru's solicitor-general, reportedly revealed on Friday that his government had already formally notified Australia of its decision to scrap the legal agreement.
According to local news media reports, Udit told two legal representatives of Matthew Batsuia - a former justice minister of Nauru, who is one of 19 people charged over protests outside Nauru parliament in 2015 - during a chance meeting with them that Nauru had issued the notice in January or December.
Baron Waqa, Nauru's president, suggested in February he would seek to sever the island's legal ties with Australia's High Court during a speech to parliament.
Each party was required by the appeals act to provide the other signatory with 90 days of notice before abolishing it.
""Severance of ties to Australia's highest court is a logical step towards full nationhood and an expression of confidence in Nauru's ability to determine its own destiny,"" Waqa said on February 12.
The government also issued a statement to the same effect almost four weeks later, on March 2, in which it committed to establishing a new local court of appeal to replace the High Court's legal function.
The government, however, is yet to specify a date for the creation of such a court.
Peter Law, a former resident magistrate in Nauru, described on Monday the timing of the government's decision as ""very unfortunate"".
""Whilst I support the idea of an appeals court being set up in Nauru, that hasn't happened yet … [and] a number of appeals are currently in progress,"" he told Al Jazeera by phone.
Law also expressed concern over the government's approach to the rule of law, suggesting Nauru's officials have ""trampled over"" the judiciary on several occasions.
""This government, over the last four years, has not really fully understood the importance of separation of power between judiciary and government … through their actions they have breached the rule of law, ignored injunctions issued by courts and sought to influence judicial decision making,"" Law said.
Law was deported from Nauru in 2014 after being sacked alongside Chief Justice Geoffrey Eames, both of whom are Australians, in a move he has since called politically motivated.
International rights groups, including Amnesty International and the International Service for Human Rights, have raised concerns in recent years over Nauru's commitment to judicial independence, suggesting the removal of Eames and Law undermined the rule of law.
The Nauru government, however, has vigorously denied accusations it has interfered with the independence of the island's judiciary.

About 50 families from remote hill and forest areas on the Bangladesh side, attracted by offers of free land and food, have moved to Rakhine State in mainly Buddhist Myanmar - the scene of a brutal army crackdown which prompted hundreds of thousands of Rohingya to flee.
A series of projects, either government and army-sponsored or privately funded, are transforming the area, which the military sees as the frontline of its fight against Islam in Myanmar.
Observers say Myanmar authorities are carrying out methodical social engineering schemes in northern Rakhine State in the absence of many of the Rohingya.
The families from the ethnic Marma and Mro tribes have left their homes in the Bandarban hill district, local councillor Muing Swi Thwee told AFP news agency.
He said 22 families departed from their villages in the Sangu forest reserve last month.
The families, mainly Buddhist but with some Christians, were being ""lured by Myanmar"" to Rakhine where they were given free land, citizenship and free food for five years, Muing Swi Thwee said.
""They are going there to fill up the land vacated by the Rohingya who have left Burma (Myanmar). They are extremely poor.""
Two Bangladeshi officials in the region confirmed the migration, saying up to 55 tribal families had left for Myanmar.
""They are being lured by some people in Myanmar in return for free homes, free food for five-seven years. Some families have shifted there after being attracted by these offers,"" Jahangir Alam, a government district administrator, told AFP news agency.
He said some of the tribal groups have family in Rakhine and these relatives are being used to woo the Bangladeshi tribals.
""These people have religious and linguistic similarities with Myanmar. Some of their ancestors have settled there in the past,"" he said.
Nearly 700,000 Rohingya have fled Rakhine State for camps in mainly Muslim Bangladesh since Myanmar last August launched a crackdown which US and UN officials have described as ""ethnic cleansing"".
An agreement to repatriate Rohingya has yet to see a single refugee returned. Rohingya leaders have said the refugees will not return unless they are allowed back to their villages, many of which have been burned down by security forces, rather than to supposedly temporary resettlement camps.
A Bangladeshi security officer told AFP that Myanmar had resettled thousands of Buddhists in Rakhine State by using a settlement scheme which offers free food, homes, cows and cash.
Muing Swi Thwee said more than 100 tribal families had left his area for Myanmar in the past three years.
Al Kaiser, another government official, said a tribal man was killed and several family members were injured in a mine blast when they were crossing into Myanmar from the town of Ali Kadam.
Officials said they suspect political motives behind the migration.
""We think perhaps they (Myanmar) want to make some news using these people, that Buddhists are being tortured and repressed in Bangladesh and that's why they have left the country,"" said one official on condition of anonymity.

But today she lives in a FARC disarmament camp (also known as reintegration areas) in the southern state of Cauca, where she has a perfect view of the lush valley and the surrounding mountains from her small, wooden balcony that she now calls home.
The FARC sprung up as a peasant movement in the 1960s, fighting corruption and huge inequality in the country, especially in rural areas. What resulted was a civil war that lasted more than 50 years and saw over 220,000 people killed and seven million displaced.
One year ago, Gomez finally put down her weapons after a landmark peace deal was signed, and entered a demobilisation camp created to help the rebels transition into citizen life.
However, like many of the other, former combatants, Gomez has become disillusioned by the peace process, saying the government isn't following through on its commitments to reintegration. This includes everything from housing to medical services and work opportunities, all of which were promised in the peace agreement.
""At the moment, it's hard for us, and a lot of people feel it,"" said Gomez, from her camp in El Estrecho, in the southern state of Cauca where the FARC once had a major stronghold. ""Many people have left because the government hasn't complied [with its agreements].""
According to Gomez, people in the camps were initially optimistic about the future of peace in Colombia. They even nicknamed her son ""el hijo de la paz"", or the son of peace, since he was born on November 24, 2016 - the same day the landmark agreement was signed.
But today, there are less than 50 former rebels living in the El Estrecho camp, out of the 315 who originally demobilised in this area last year.
The figures are similar in camps across the country. The UN recently calculated that more than 55 percent of all the FARC members have left the 26 reincorporation zones.
Many of them have left to join their families back home, find jobs in other regions, or are even suspected of joining dissident factions or other armed groups.
But the reasons for leaving are often the same; there is not enough motivation to stay in the camps.
Of all the 26 reincorporation zones, El Estrecho is an extreme example of underdevelopment. The camp lacks running water, the former combatants all share one toilet, and people are still living in makeshift tarpaulin tents made of plastic.
But El Estrecho is also a new zone. The former combatants relocated here in December last year from their previous location of Policarpa, Narino, saying the government failed to comply with any of its development promises, including basic housing, which was meant to be finished before they even laid down their arms last January.
Officials say the lack of development in Policarpa was due to its complicated and remote location, a common problem for most of the reincorporation camps.
""The [demobilisation] areas where the FARC built are areas that are very difficult to access,"" said Luis Hernando Moreno, regional coordinator of the Office of the High Commissioner for Peace (OACP), the main liaising body between the FARC and the government.
""Policarpa was so far out there, even the guerrillas couldn't get there,"" Hernando continued.
But this highlights an important reality for Colombia, where more than 40 percent of the rural population lives in poverty, according to the World Bank, and where state investment in public infrastructure, particularly roads, schools or hospitals is rare.
In many rural areas, like Policarpa, roads either don't exist or were made by the communities themselves. This is one of the major, structural reasons the war began in the first place. A lingering and important issue, rural reform is the first point in the peace agreements.
The local FARC leaders expect things to be different in El Estrecho, which is only nine kilometres from the Pan-American highway. They say officials have no excuse for resources not getting to the camp.
Apart from the basics of housing and water, the biggest concern for the former combatants here is receiving help to develop their own economic projects.
This includes land for agricultural use and funding for entrepreneurial or cooperative projects, two of the main demands across all of the camps.
According to Leovigildo Moreno Zambrano, a member of the FARC's pedagogy unit, now in El Estrecho, things are moving ""very slow. Too slow.
""What is lacking is real political will on the part of the state,"" he told Al Jazeera.
Most of the former fighters do have bank accounts and identification cards and are receiving a small monthly stipend of roughly $230.
These are just three points in the peace deal the government has complied with so far, directed at the former rebels individually.
But without productive projects, or education and work training, the former rebels struggle to fill their days.
According to Moreno, the FARC is playing politics by focusing on what the government is not doing, rather than providing solutions.
""The politics of the FARC right now are to show the defects of the other, instead of transforming,"" he told Al Jazeera. ""You have to blame the state, because in some way that helps to delegitimise the state and legitimise your discourse.""
There are no laws forcing the former rebels to stay in their territories, but the outflow of people is raising alarm bells among international monitors.
In November, the UN warned the exodus was a troubling sign that may be increasing the number of FARC dissident groups, and told the Colombian government that it must ""substantially accelerate"" its reintegration effort.
The former FARC combatants are also a prime recruitment target for other armed groups that continue to exist in Colombia's rural areas.
These include paramilitary groups, narcotraffickers, the National Liberation Army (ELN), and other, smaller groups.
According to the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC), which has long worked with war victims in Colombia's countryside, the only way out of this cycle is to give the demobilised rebels alternative opportunities to avoid recruitment.
The NRC has implemented high-school education programmes in several of the FARC camps for this very reason, after an evaluation of the former rebel fighters showed that more than 80 percent had not finished high school.
""The fact that some have left without receiving a process of reincorporation, yes we see it as a big risk,"" said Christian Visnes, the NRC's Country Director in Colombia.
""We offer education so that these people can reincorporate into civil life; that's the first step to ending the war,"" he said.
In November, Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos admitted that the government has made mistakes in the process, but told the country to ""be patient"".
But since Colombia is in an election year, many citizens are already looking forward to what a new government will bring, rather than expecting new commitments from Santos, who will not be up for re-election, nor does he have a direct successor.
According to the latest polls, left-wing candidate Gustavo Petro is in the lead, but Ivan Duque, a member of the far-right Democratic Centre (Centro Democratico) party and vocal adversary of the peace agreement, is not far behind.
On March 11, Colombians held congressional elections, where the Democratic Centre party and other right-wing candidates won most of the seats. But, the number of Green Party and other alternative party seats also doubled - including the 10 spaces saved for members of the FARC, as agreed in the peace agreements Back in El Estrecho, Blanca Gomez says being patient for politicians to implement change isn't always easy, especially when people continue to lack resources in the camp and they consistently hear about violence increasing in certain areas in the country, including the assassinations of some of their own colleagues.
""We have to wait to see what solution the government is going to give,"" said Blanca. ""But us here without arms or anything. It's very frustrating.""

After the outcry on Wednesday, the page advertising the ""Greece & the Euro"" holiday was taken down from the newspaper's website.
The week-long ""educational and informative tour of modern Greece"" that was advertised on The Guardian's website came at a cost of 2,500 British pounds ($3,527), with a starting date of March 31, 2019.
Belatedly the @guardian have withdrawn this “holiday” of misery tourism to #Greece #shame on you for organising it in the first place https://t.co/0JmLNa3Uqo
The trip, which is ""exclusively designed for Guardian readers"", gives travellers ""the chance to meet local families and discover how their lives have been affected by the financial crisis"", the newspaper's website said.
""Explore the financial crisis in microcosm through one Athens suburb and the charities and municipalities supporting people through austerity,"" the advertisement said of the trip, organised in partnership with the Political Tours travel company.
During the holiday, readers will also be able to discuss the refugee crisis with a local NGO, Greek officials and international agencies, The Guardian said.
Included in the seven-day itinerary from the island of Samos to Athens is the chance to meet and travel with The Guardian's Greece correspondent, Helena Smith, the newspaper said.
In an emailed statement to Al Jazeera later on Wednesday, a spokesperson for Guardian News & Media said: ""The Guardian has been working with Political Tours to provide informative trips to Greece and other countries for people who wish to develop their understanding of the political and social landscapes in these places.
""On reflection, we have now paused this project in order to reconsider our approach.""
Earlier, many Greeks and others had taken to Twitter to criticise the newspaper for cashing in on ""crisis tourism in a crisis-ridden"" country.

Greece has long been feeling the effects of a global financial crisis and domestic economic mismanagement.
Over the past decade, consecutive governments have introduced a series of harsh austerity measures in order to tackle the country's crippling debt, leading to widespread public protests.
Greece is also home to tens of thousands refugees, many of whom risked their lives undertaking dangerous sea journeys to flee war-torn countries such as Syria.

Can Greece cope with the refugee crisis?

On Wednesday, the Greek daily Ekathimerini reported that eight boats carrying more than 300 people had reached the Greek island since Tuesday.
Speaking to Al Jazeera, the office of Lesbos Mayor Spiros Galinos confirmed an uptick in arrivals but was unable to provide an exact number.
""We have heard from the police that there were boats yesterday and today in Lesbos,"" said Marios Andriotis, the mayor's spokesperson.
Andriotis added the arrivals will exacerbate the already declining humanitarian conditions on the island, where ""the overpopulation in [Moria refugee camp] has been causing issues both inside the camp and outside in the surrounding communities.""
More than 5,300 refugees and migrants are currently stuck in Moria camp in Lesbos, where overcrowding, poor living conditions and tensions with local Greek communities have prompted concern among human rights groups and aid organisations.
Moria is equipped to accommodate around 2,000 people.
Most asylum seekers on Greek islands are barred from travelling to the mainland without receiving permission from authorities.
Eva Cosse, a researcher at Human Rights Watch, warned that the Greek government should ""end the containment policy"" on Greek islands because ""it is not a sustainable solution.
""We fear that now, as the weather becomes better, we'll see large numbers of people arriving,"" she told Al Jazeera. ""The situation is already problematic, but it could become even worse.""
At least 13,289 refugees and migrants have reached Europe by crossing the Mediterranean Sea so far this year, according to the United Nations refugee agency (UNHCR). Of that total, some 4,286 have landed in Greece.
Some 489 have died or gone missing in the Mediterranean Sea thus far in 2018, according to the UNHCR.
In 2017, the Greek government received 58,661 asylum applications, according to the migration ministry's statistics. Since the start of 2018, at least 8,815 asylum applications have been submitted.
In March 2016, the European Union and Turkey struck a deal to stem the flow of refugees and migrants to Europe.
That deal was lambasted by rights groups and critics who said it effectively turned Greece into a ""warehouse"" for asylum seekers.
As a result of the agreement, tens of thousands of people fleeing war and economic devastation were stranded in Greece.
On March 17, a boat carrying refugees capsized while en route to Greece from Turkey. The Greek coastguard subsequently found 16 bodies, among them children.
In a press release published that same day, Greece's migration minister, Dimitris Vitsas, said there was an urgent need for a ""solution"" to the ongoing humanitarian crisis.
""We can't tolerate losing children in the Aegean Sea … The solution is to protect people, to implement safe procedures and safe routes for migrants and refugees, to hit the human trafficking circuits,"" Vitsas said in the statement, as reported by Ekathimerini at the time.

Ahmed Hassan was sentenced to a minimum of 34 years in prison on Friday for the attack at Parsons Green station in September last year.
The explosive device he made failed to detonate completely and killed no one but left at least 30 people injured.
At the trial, Justice Charles Haddon-Cave said the 18-year-old sympathiser of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL, also known as ISIS) group had committed 'hiraba' (terrorism) and caused 'corruption in the land'.
Both terms are used in Islamic law to describe acts of rebellion and are often used by theologians in the modern context to refer to ""terrorism"".
""You will have plenty of time to study the Quran in prison in the years to come,"" Justice Haddon-Cave said in his closing remarks at Hassan's trial.
He added: ""The Quran and Islam forbid anything extreme, including extremism in religion. Islam forbids breaking the 'law of the land' where one is living or is a guest. Islam forbids terrorism.
""The Quran and the Sunna provide that the crime of perpetrating terror to 'cause corruption in the land' is one of the most severe crimes in Islam ... so it is in the law of the United Kingdom.""
Hassan arrived in the UK as a 16-year-old refugee from Iraq just three years earlier.
At the time, he claimed to have been an orphan who had been kidnapped by ISIL.

Thousands took part in rallies in Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane and Perth among other cities to call on the Liberal Party-led government to allow refugees under its care on Manus Island and Nauru to come to Australia.
Almost 10,000 people marched in Melbourne, according to the organisers, including religious leaders, community organisations and refugee advocates.
Protesters chanted ""shame"" and ""free, free the refugees"" while accusing Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull and Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton of punishing people fleeing persecution and war.
Under strict border control policies, asylum seekers who arrive by boat are sent to processing centres the Australian government manages in the Pacific and permanently bans them from settling in Australia.
Many have been waiting for a country to resettle in for years. Although the US has agreed to take some of the 1,700 asylum seekers currently on the islands, most still face an uncertain future.
""I think it's cruel and unethical,"" said Miron Mizrahi, a protester in Melbourne.
""It's shameful and damning, the fact that this society - one of the richest and safest on the planet - is suddenly so afraid of these people and that this is what we have to do to them to protect ourselves.""
Abdul Aziz, a Sudanese asylum seeker, addressed the crowd from Manus Island, Papua New Guinea, where he has been kept for the last five years.
""We will keep fighting and we will never give up,"" said Aziz while speaking over the phone.
""Despite the brutality, the hardship, the torture and trauma that we are seeing every single day on Manus Island and Nauru, we will not stop fighting for our freedom.""
Turnbull's centre-right government insists off-shore processing is necessary to secure the border and deter human smugglers from claiming they can give asylum seekers a new life in Australia.
Under laxer policies overseen by a previous Labor Party government, about 50,000 people arrived in Australia by sea - 1,200 asylum seekers drowned while making the journey.
The centre-left opposition party has supported the government's stance on off-shore processing.
An opinion poll released by Roy Morgan last year found Australians to be evenly divided on whether refugees at off-shore centres should be allowed to enter the country.
The UN and rights groups such as Amnesty International have condemned the off-shore processing system as cruel and inhumane, causing widespread despair, self-harm and suicide attempts among those affected.
Last month, a judge overruled the Department of Home Affairs and ordered a 10-year-old boy on Nauru, who had repeatedly attempted suicide, to be brought to Australia for treatment.
""There's got to be a better way of doing it,"" said Mizrahi outside Melbourne State Library of Victoria. ""In other words, it's like having an infection and cutting your figure off. It makes no sense.""

""The hunger had grown, from 778 million people in 2015 to 815 million in 2016,"" he said.

Speaking during the conference, UN Undersecretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs Mark Lowcock said, ""Despite the wildest predictions, famines have become less frequent and less lethal over the past few decades.""
The remaining risk of famine and hunger is now concentrated in a relatively small number of countries affected by large-scale, severe and protracted conflict,"" Lowcock said.
""Almost 490 million undernourished people - and almost 80 percent of the world's 155 million stunted children - live in countries affected by conflict,"" he added.

Journey, which tells the story of an Iraqi woman struggling under conflict and sectarian violence, premiered in the capital, Baghdad, earlier this month.
The psychological drama, based loosely on real-life events, shows a young woman, Sara, who tries to blow herself up in Baghdad's only train station in 2006.
The film made its international debut at the 2017 Toronto International Film Festival in September.
Mohammed al-Daraji, the film's director and producer, told Al Jazeera that Journey gives a sober moral perspective on the war that has devastated the country, killing nearly a million people and creating a refugee and orphan crisis.
""We have the boycott, the sanctions and then after that the war, the occupation, sectarian violence and then we ended with Daesh (Arabic acronym for the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant group - ISIL, also known as ISIS),"" he said.
""But, we managed now as Iraqis to get back again. That is what we learn as Iraqis and we are coming to the point where we are going to challenge our limit and go further and further.

Iraqi cinema was once regarded as one of the best in the region. But after 15 years of violence, insecurity and sectarianism following the US invasion in 2003, the industry has suffered.
Baghdad has a thriving cinema scene, screening mostly Hollywood blockbusters and Egyptian films.
""Everyone dreams of watching an Iraqi-produced film because for a long time Iraqi cinema had no productions at all,"" Safirah Naji, film critic, told Al Jazeera.

So few asylum seekers crossed the US border illegally over the years that Canada didn't consistently track the numbers.
All that changed dramatically over the past 14 months. US President Donald Trump's crackdown on illegal immigration and his move to strip Haitians, Salvadorans and others of their temporary legal status have had a broad effect on Canada's refugee system, Reuters news agency interviews with social service providers, government officials and a review of Canadian immigration data show.
More than 20,000 people, including thousands of Haitians and Nigerians and hundreds of Turks, Syrians and Eritreans, have crossed the border into Canada illegally over the past year in search of asylum, many fleeing in fear that Trump would deport them to their countries of origin.
This unexpected northward migration has overwhelmed Canada's system for processing asylum claims, leading to the worst delays in years. Aid agencies are also struggling to house asylum seekers because of a shortage of accommodation in the four cities most affected by the migration wave - Toronto, Montreal, Winnipeg and Vancouver.
While some of this has been reported, this story offers the most complete picture to date of the unintended effect of Trump's immigration policies on the US' northern neighbour.
The Canadian government was forced to set aside 173 million Canadian dollars ($133m) in its latest budget to pay for extra patrols at border crossings to cope with the influx, as well as security screening and processing of refugee applications.
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's government has discussed the situation with the Trump administration, but it has been careful not to publicly blame the US president's policies for triggering the migration wave. Nevertheless, it is already making preparations for more people to cross the border once the weather warms.
""We will be ready,"" Immigration and Refugee Minister Ahmed Hussen said in an interview.
Aid agencies who are at the forefront of dealing with the influx say they are struggling and need more funding, a comprehensive long-term plan and better coordination with Ottawa.
""It's going to get worse. The numbers keep climbing,"" said Ilona Beiks, vice president of the Inland Refugee Society of British Columbia, which had to turn away refugees last year for the first time in its 35-year history because it did not have enough money to cope with the growing number of asylum seekers.
The influx shows no signs of abating. More than 1,500 asylum seekers walked across the border in January. Those working with refugee claimants say this is no blip: It's the new normal.
Since January 2017, Reuters has sought to obtain the numbers of asylum seekers who walked across the US border into Canada in the years prior to Trump's election. The Canadian government has said no national historical data is available.
Trump's tougher immigration policies have had a major effect on Canada's Immigration and Refugee Board, which determines refugee claims. It has become so overwhelmed with cases it is ignoring legislated time limits for dealing with them.
All refugee claims are supposed to be processed within 60 days. Increasingly, the board has failed to meet those targets. In December 2017, 86 percent of hearings did not happen within prescribed time frames, according to previously unpublished data reviewed by Reuters. That was up from 66 percent in December 2016, a month after Trump was elected president, and 26 percent in December 2015.
On February 20, the board said it will effectively prioritize those applicants who have been waiting months or years. This will mean a longer wait for more recent arrivals than the current 20-month average estimated time for processing claims.
The government is ""committed to an efficient and fair asylum system"", said a spokesman for Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada, the government department responsible for the Immigration and Refugee Board.
Canada's refugee tribunals have historically been leery of claims made by people who come through its wealthy southern neighbour. But of the more than 2,500 claims finalized last year, 53 percent were granted refugee status.
Rulings reviewed by Reuters indicate the tribunals are giving credence to claimants who say they feared deportation or racist attacks following Trump's election on a platform advocating more restrictions on immigration.
The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Asylum seekers are walking across the border into some of the tightest housing markets on the continent.
Last summer, thousands slept in Montreal's Olympic stadium.
In Toronto, 31 percent of the people sleeping in city-run shelters in January were refugee claimants - up from nearly 19 percent a year ago, according to city data.
In November, Toronto approved the booking of more hotel rooms for refugee claimants through the end of 2018, at a cost of about 20 million Canadian dollars ($15.4m), according to city documents.
The city is working on a more comprehensive refugee plan but it needs more help from the federal government, said councillor Kristyn Wong-Tam. The status quo, renting thousands of hotel beds, ""is absolutely unsustainable"", she said.
""We are not saying 'No' to refugees. We are saying, 'Absolutely: Come and live in Toronto. Build your life in Toronto.' But we cannot do this without the support of other orders of government,"" she said.
Toronto's mayor ""has raised this issue repeatedly with the federal government"", the mayor's spokesman, Don Peat, wrote in an email.
The federal government says it won't give cities more money for asylum seekers, who are barred from accessing a 762 million Canadian dollar ($586.6m) federal fund that is for permanent residents or people who have already been granted refugee status.
A spokesman for Hussen, the immigration minister, said asylum seekers can access provincial programs. Some agencies Reuters spoke with, however, said that isn't enough and that a national effort is needed.
Toronto is not alone in asking for help. Vancouver has asked the British Columbia provincial government for more money for refugee aid agencies, said city spokesman Jag Sandhu, and the province has promised six million Canadian dollars ($4.6m) a year over three years. Winnipeg is coordinating with the Manitoba government to find accommodation for refugee claimants, the city said.
Canada has no formal system for integrating refugee claimants and depends heavily on aid agencies that operate independently but are funded through a combination of government grants and private donations.
Dozens of agencies in Toronto, Winnipeg, Vancouver and Montreal are taking the lead in housing and feeding new arrivals and helping them find schools and employment.
Of 17 organizations Reuters spoke with, 11 said interviews with border crossers confirmed that many were fleeing because of Trump's immigration policies.
""We know the numbers have increased because of what's going on in the US,"" said Toronto-based doctor Meb Rashid, who runs the provincially funded Crossroads Clinic.
The number of patients at the clinic grew 40 percent in a year and people now wait several weeks for an appointment, Rashid said.
""We're struggling, I have to be honest with you.""
Two aid groups said they have had to turn people away, one has had to intensify its fundraising, two have had to extend their operating hours to meet demand, while six who help to house new arrivals are struggling to find accommodation for them.
The Manitoba Interfaith Immigration Council in Winnipeg has seen its refugee claimant caseload increase fivefold in the past year, said executive director Rita Chahal.
""The impact has been huge,"" she said, adding that the organization had to launch its first fundraising drive in years to meet the additional costs.
The Canadian government has dispatched legislators to diaspora communities in the US to persuade people not to come. But it has said little about what conversations it has had with Washington on stemming the migration.
The spokesman for Hussen, the immigration minister, said Canada has a ""long-standing, solid working relationship"" with the US.
Meanwhile, the contingency plans being developed to deal with the expected surge in border crossers include redeploying police and border agents to overwhelmed areas and setting up accommodation such as tents and trailers at ports of entry, said a spokesman for the Canada Border Services Agency.
""There is an expectation the numbers will go up ... as the weather gets better,"" said a source familiar with the Canadian government's thinking. ""And who knows what the next order coming from down south will be?""

More than 2,000 items fill the room at the Fire Station art gallery in Qatar's capital, Doha.
Tidy rows of clothes and shoes might resemble a fashion collection, but at the exhibition titled, Laundromat, they tell a different story: the items are all from a Greek refugee camp which no longer exists.
It is evidence of disrupted Syrian lives on the move - and of a refugee crisis that is not going away.
The exhibition is one of many held in Qatar, aiming to inspire young artists seeking to create art that focuses on social and political issues.
Khalifa al-Obaidli, the director of Fire Station gallery, hopes exhibitions like these will inspire local artists to explore new ways of creating art.
""We had Damien Hirst, we had Richard Serra, we had [Takashi] Murakami. All these names really have a big impact,"" al-Obaidli told Al Jazeera.
""Here, we're not looking for beauty. It's more about art that has got a message.""
Dimitrije Bugarski, a Serbian graffiti artist who lives in Doha, finds inspiration by creating art that focuses on social and political messages, including the nine-month-long blockade of Qatar.
""Graffiti most of the times is a form of activism, but sometimes it's also very personal and doesn't relate to anything other than the person who's doing it,"" he told Al Jazeera.
""It's a great way of expressing things for a cause and with a message.""
Referring to Laundromat, Bugarski hopes this type of exhibition will help broaden his skills.
Many artists believe activism through art is one of the most potent ways to navigate divisive politics.
Among the most striking developments in the contemporary Middle East art scene is undoubtedly the emergence of female artists sharing their ideas.
""In 2005, a Saudi artist Manal al-Dowayan made a work called The Choice, about the right for women to drive. It's only 10 years after her artwork that women [in Saudi Arabia] will start to have the right to drive,"" says Abdellah Karroum, the director of Doha's Mathaf Museum.
Today, al-Dowayan's installation hangs suspended at the Mathaf museum. The doves hanging from the ceiling represent the lack of freedom of movement for Saudi women.
The installation was exhibited abroad in Europe. In it, the doves have been shown carrying documents that Saudi women need for travel.
The document, mehram, is the consent given by a male relative for a Saudi woman to travel.

After the invasion the country descended into chaos and conflict as rival groups, foreign powers and political parties fight for power.
Amid all this, here is what has become of Saddam's family and former ruling party members:
Sons killed: Saddam's two sons, Uday and Qusay were killed by US troops in 2003.
Refugee wife: As with some of Saddam's aides and relatives, his wife Sajida Talfah fled the country to seek refuge abroad.
Most wanted: Saddam Hussein's daughter, Raghad was listed in the Iraqi government's placed most wanted list together with 59 other individuals.
Executed: Most top government officials were either arrested or killed by US troops including vice president Taha Yassin Ramadan and presidential adviser Ali Hassan al-Majid both executed by hanging.
Prison: Other former Iraqi officials are still in prison, including former defence minister Sultan Hashim al-Tai.
Others died in prison as Vice President Taha Muhie-eldin Marouf, Prime Minister Mohammed Hamza al-Zubeidi, Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz and Deputy Premier Hikmat Mizbah al-Azzawi.
Other former officials were released by US military, including party members and biologist Huda Saleh Mahdi.
After the US invasion, some members of the now-defunct Baath party sought to regroup, particularly in Sunni-majority provinces, where anger against the Shia majority was growing.
Among those members were former party members Seif al-Din al-Mashhadani and Fadil Mahmoud Gharib.
""[Some party members] fled Iraq following the invasion, but returned again when Mosul fell to ISIL,"" Ibrahim al-Sumaidaie, a security and political researcher, told Anadolu news agency.
""Many former regime officials have managed to flee Iraq to Syria, Jordan, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates and other countries,"" Sobhi Nazem, a military expert, said. ""Some others chose to seek refuge in the West.""
In 2014, ISIL overran vast swaths of territory in northern and western Iraq, but much of the territory was recaptured by the US-backed Iraqi forces in late 2017.

""I was 11 when I came to this refugee camp. That's when the war started in Syria,"" said Najat, a Syrian teenager. ""My dream is to become a pharmacist.""
The 16-year-old knew just enough English to declare her dreams.
She has lived in the camp all her teenage life, witnessing its transformation into a city-like settlement.
""In the beginning, the camp was made of just tents. But we improved it. Anyone who looks at the camp now can say that we don't lack anything,"" she said.
Around 80,000 Syrians live in Zaatari refugee camp, which was established in July 2012 to shelter those fleeing Syria into Jordan.
Around 55 percent of the population here is under 18. Many, like Najat, will remember most of their childhood spent on the dusty streets of Zaatari.
For Mahmoud, 15, as well, Syria is a distant memory.
""My father said we lived a good life in Syria, a normal one. I wish I could remember it.""
Mahmoud
He spoke of his dreams to become a famous singer, like his childhood heroes Lebanese legend Fairuz or Umm Kalthoum from Egypt.
""If I became famous, I wouldn't be greedy. I'd buy a house or a car for myself. But then I would help the poor, people like me, living in refugee camps.
""I want our homeland to be free, to go back to the way it was.""

The NGO Proactiva Open Arms said its vessel responded to boats in distress in international waters off the coast of Libya on March 15.
The vessel took the 216 rescued refugees and migrants to the Sicilian port of Pozzallo port on March 17, where the ship was seized.
Complications in the operation began when the NGO attended to the second boat in distress.
Crew members said they were approached by a Libyan patrol boat demanding they transferred the migrants to them, claiming the Libyans used ""death threats"" and intimidation.
The incident was caught on video by the Open Arms staff.
The NGO ship was then left sailing in the Mediterranean for more than 24 hours, as Italian authorities claimed they had not coordinated the rescue and were, therefore, not responsible.
Meanwhile, staff evacuated some of the victims, including a three-month-old and her mother in need of medical attention, to the nearest port, which at that point was Malta.
The ship was eventually allowed to dock in Pozzallo, after the Spanish government intervened in the negotiations.
Italian authorities in Catania then proceeded to confiscate the boat and open an investigation against three crew members - the captain, rescue coordinator and the NGO's director.
They are accused of ""aiding and abetting illegal migration"", and risk up to seven years in prison and hefty fines for the NGO.
""At that point, these people were in European territory, therefore, handing them over would have been a collective pushback,"" the captain, Marc Reig, said in a statement, adding handing over the refugees and migrants would have been against international law.
""Despite the immediate vicinity of the island of Malta, [Open Arms] proceeded to sail towards the Italian coast while waiting for instructions from the Spanish authorities,"" the Italian coastguard wrote in a statement.
NGOs that operate rescue missions in the Mediterranean fear Italy's moves were aimed at intimidating rescuers.
""Taking someone back from international waters to a country against their will is a violation of human rights,"" Alex Steier, a spokesperson for the German organisation Mission Lifeline, told Al Jazeera. ""That's why it should not be allowed for any ship from the European Union to hand over [rescued people] to the Libyan coastguard,"" he explained.
""Due to the seizure of this rescue vessel, the European border regime has reached a new level. Not only are Libyan militias being supported with EU funds, but search and rescue NGOs are being confronted with defamation.
""Now, the criminalisation of solidarity is going so far as to expose organisations who are operating under international law. The only possibility to be rescued at sea is openly being suppressed by radical methods, and even more people will die in the Mediterranean,"" Steier said.
In July, Italy asked NGOs operating rescue missions in the Mediterranean to sign up to a code of conduct.
With EU support, Italy provided equipment and training to the Libyan coastguard to patrol the coast and intercept refugees and migrants before they are rescued by NGOs.
""Rules must be respected by all actors involved in search and rescue events, to guarantee that the lives of migrants are not put in further danger and that the sovereignty of the state is respected at all stages,"" European Commission spokesperson Natasha Bertaud told Al Jazeera.
""It is for national authorities to investigate any specific cases and we trust the Italian authorities are doing exactly this.""
But according to Human Rights Watch, the charges against the Open Arms NGO are ""the latest in a series of measures to discredit NGO rescue groups"".
""It is shocking that Europe has reached the point of criminalising rescue at sea,"" said Judith Sunderland, associate director for Europe and Central Asia director at Human Rights Watch. ""Europeans should support, not smear, people saving lives in the Mediterranean, and remember that EU and Italian policies are propping up a cycle of detention and violence in Libya, while groups like Proactiva are saving lives.""

Government forces have retaken about 80 percent of the Damascus suburb, which was controlled by armed opposition groups since mid-2013.
In footage released by Syrian state TV, Assad was seen greeting Syrian army soldiers, as they cheered the president's arrival.
""The people of Damascus appreciate all of you for protecting the city, and we will remember this for tens of years, or even generations,"" Assad told the soldiers.
""This battle has been bigger than Syria - today you are fighting this battle on behalf of the whole world,"" he said.
""For each bullet you shot that killed a terrorist, you changed the balance of the world.""
Assad's visit came as activists in Eastern Ghouta said the government arrested ""hundreds"" of civilians who have fled the violence in the besieged enclave over the past few days.
Activists also said that air raids continued to hit the homes of remaining civilians in the enclave on Monday, with more than 60 air strikes killing at least eight people.
The main rebel group in the area, Failaq al-Rahman, said it is in negotiations with the United Nations about a ceasefire, and said it is also asking for aid to be allowed in for the thousands of civilians that are still trapped inside.
The United Nations refugee agency says more than 20,000 people have fled the fighting in Eastern Ghouta.
The Syrian government and its allies said they are continuing to attack three rebel-held pockets of the enclave, which was, until recently, home to nearly 400,000 people.
According to activists inside the enclave, those who have made their way to government-controlled territories are often detained by government forces upon arriving at multiple points on the outskirts of the city.
""Today, there were people who were arrested in the town of Kafr Batna … men who have been leaving over the past three days are instantly being detained,"" Alaa al-Ahmed, a local activist, told Al Jazeera from the town of Ein Tarma in Eastern Ghouta.
""This is because the evacuations are happening without the supervision of international bodies, they're taking place without any guarantees,"" he said.
""We're also hearing reports of mass executions in Hamouriyah,"" he said, referring to the town that has been at the centre of the fighting between rebels and military forces.
Al Jazeera has not been able to independently verify the claims.
The UNHCR office in Syria's capital confirmed that there are three shelters in the rural Damascus area where people from Eastern Ghouta are arriving: Dwier, Hejelleh and Adra.
Though some aid has been distributed to people in the shelters, food and sanitary supplies are barely covering the needs of the thousands who continue to flee.
Elizabeth Hoff, spokesperson for the World Health Organization in Syria, told Al Jazeera that civilians who had stayed in underground shelters for weeks before fleeing showed symptoms of skin diseases, vitamin deficiencies, in addition to many suffering from malnutrition and chronic diseases.
Meanwhile, remaining resident inside the enclave - more than 340,000 people - are suffering from acute food shortages and a lack of medical supplies.
Ali al-Khouli, an independent journalist in Douma, one of Eastern Ghouta's main towns, described the current situation as ""uninhabitable"".
""No infrastructure, no food, no medicine, no hospitals left here in Eastern Ghouta,"" he said.
""Families who left here have done so as a result of the heavy bombardment, they say it is more merciful than having to endure the government's shelling,"" al-Khouli added.
According to al-Khouli, those who chose to leave were ""100 percent"" certain that if they stayed, they would have lost their lives and ended up ""under the rubble"".
Al Jazeera's Zeina Khodr, reporting from Beirut in neighbouring Lebanon, said the front lines are changing and the government is regaining territory, prompting thousands to flee.
""We know that the government considers anyone in the opposition a terrorist,"" she said, pointing to Civil Defence workers - also known as the White Helmets - as an example.
Both al-Khouli and al-Ahmed say that the government facilitated corridors for the evacuation of civilians, but it is unclear where the families are headed exactly.
""There are multiple locations we hear they're being transferred to, but exact locations have not yet been confirmed,"" al-Khouli said.
Activists have also noted that many would rather flee to other rebel-held territories instead.
Organisations such as Human Rights Watch, the UN, ICRC, have all called on international observers to be deployed on the ground to ensure that people are safe.

The Syrian government attacks on Saturday also injured dozens more, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) said, as civilians attempted to flee the front lines in the besieged enclave.
The attack comes as thousands of civilians over the past days fled Eastern Ghouta, which has been under a month-long bombardment campaign by the government.
The UK-based SOHR said at least 10,000 people fled the Damascus suburb on Saturday, as deadly air raids continued.
On Friday, 46 civilians, including six children, were killed in the district of Kafr Batna, according to the Observatory.
Earlier on Friday, it was reported that between 12,000 and 13,000 people had fled the area east of Damascus.
Abandoning their homes with whatever they could carry - some with their vehicles and others on foot - desperate civilians fled to areas under government control.
The humanitarian situation in the suburb east of Damascus has worsened since February 18, when Russian-backed Syrian warplanes intensified their attack on the enclave, killing more than 1,250 people in a relentless bombardment, despite efforts to implement a lasting ceasefire.
In an earlier attempt to drive armed opposition groups out, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's government imposed a tight siege on Eastern Ghouta back in 2013 - shortly after it fell under rebel control.
As a result of the blockade, food shortages and a lack of medical supplies has left some 400,000 residents desperate for aid.
Assad's forces are inching closer to capturing the rest of the enclave, forcing civilians to flee. They have already split the enclave into three sections.
Among the thousands of civilians who fled, many were from the town of Hamouriyah, which has been at the centre of the fighting between rebels and military forces.
Government forces now surround Hamouriyah, with residents reporting a lack of access to water and medicine. But rebels claim they have retaken the district.
The United Nations refugee agency in Syria said people in Eastern Ghouta are continuing to leave the area on Saturday, with an estimated 12,000 to 16,000 people having left in the past days.
""The majority of those leaving are from the Hamouriyah area, but also include some medical cases from Douma,"" Mysa Khalaf, UNHCR's spokesperson, told Al Jazeera from Damascus.
""The actual number of people who have exited eastern Ghouta is not known, nor are the destinations of all evacuees,"" she said.
The UNHCR office in Syria's capital confirmed that there are three shelters in the Damascus area where people from Eastern Ghouta are arriving: Dwier, Hejelleh and Adra.
""The overall humanitarian scene is dire. The UN has delivered emergency items such as food, mattresses, blankets and hygiene kits and is preparing for further assistance to be delivered in response to the growing numbers of people arriving at the shelters,"" Khalaf said, describing the scenes at the shelters.
""Mobile clinics are providing medical services and vaccinations to children under five. Those in need of medical care are being treated at hospitals in Damascus.""
Meanwhile, about 25 trucks of food aid were allowed into Eastern Ghouta's Douma district, according to the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).
It is unclear how long the food supply would last in an area believed to be populated with as many as 125,000.
Thursday marked seven years since the Syrian civil war began, with more than 465,000 Syrians killed and millions more displaced.

Refugees, solidarity activists, leftists and anti-fascists marched throughout the Greek capital on Saturday, just three days in advance of the EU-Turkey deal's second anniversary.
The rally was as part of the call for protests to mark the International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, which is commemorated each year on March 21.
""We have called for protests against all of the EU's deals with countries which were made to return refugees to so-called 'safe countries',"" Nasim Lomani, an Athens-based activist with the Network of Social Support for Migrants and Refugees, told Al Jazeera.
On Saturday morning, just hours before the rally started, a boat carrying refugees and migrants from Turkey sank near the Greek island of Agathonisi, situated in the eastern Aegean Sea.
The Greek coastguard has found 16 bodies, among them children, so far, but they expect the death toll to increase, according to the Greek daily Ekathimerini.
""This is exactly why it's important to protest today - Fortress Europe is killing people every day,"" Lomani added.
In a press release published on Saturday, Greece's migration minister, Dimitris Vitsas, called for a ""solution"" to the ongoing refugee crisis.
""We can't tolerate losing children in the Aegean Sea … the solution is to protect people, to implement safe procedures and safe routes for migrants and refugees, to hit the human trafficking circuits,"" Vitsas said in the statement, as reported by Ekathimerini.
Reached in March 2016, the EU-Turkey deal was hailed by its supporters as a landmark agreement.
Critics decried the deal for leaving asylum seekers with few options beyond remaining stranded in Turkey or taking increasingly dangerous routes to Europe.
After the agreement was reached, countries across Eastern Europe sealed their borders, effectively closing the so-called 'Western Balkans route' that previously had been widely used by refugees and migrants.
""The protest today is important because the situations in [refugees' home countries] is getting worse,"" Qafar Karimi, a 40-year-old Afghan refugee, told Al Jazeera.
""Our message to the whole world is: Open the borders.""
Karimi added: ""Every day, the wars in Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan are getting worse. It's not fit for living any more, and that's why we came here. We are refugees from war; we are not economic migrants.""

Protesters gathered near Oxford Circus on Saturday for the Stand Up To Racism march to oppose growing racism, Islamophobia and anti-Semitism.
Crowds marched to Whitehall as they held banners, reading ""Migrants and refugees are welcome here"" and ""Stop racist attacks"".
""There is racism in the UK, it is just more hidden because it's so diverse and acts on a more subliminal level,"" Abraham Khoudari said at the march.
""But when it's like that it is even worse,"" the 18-year-old Syrian told Al Jazeera.
""Nationalists have come to the forefront, they are in parliament and in power. It means more people are becoming more confident about expressing their racist views. The result of that is hate crimes increasing so much. It's just terrible and we are sick of it.""
The march comes less than a month after Mark Rowley, who recently retired as the Metropolitan Police's counterterrorism chief, warned that the far right poses an ""organised and significant"" threat to the country, as he revealed that four far-right ""terrorist"" plots had been foiled since the beginning of the year.
When asked if the government is doing enough to tackle the rise of far-right violence, Khoudari responded at the time: ""No because a lot of far-right politicians are now in government. They won't clamp down because capitalism and the far-right go hand in hand.""
Labour MEP and Chair of the Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs Committee, Claude Moraes told Al Jazeera there is ""significant threat"" from the far right in the UK.
Moraes said it stems from a ""very strong populist wave based on anti-Muslim, anti-refugee rhetoric and an increasingly anti-Semitic one"", coupled with ""hardcore trends of the far right"".
Saturday's protest is expected to spread across both the UK and the EU, and coincide with the UN International Day for the Elimination of Racism and Discrimination.
According to a UN report, ""divisive, anti-immigrant and xenophobic rhetoric"" during the EU referendum campaign triggered a surge in hate crimes following Britain's June 2016 vote to quit the bloc.
The year between 2016 and 2017 saw the largest percentage increase in hate crimes since the 2011 to 2012 period, with the number of reported offences rising to 80,393. The majority of those offences - 78 percent - were racially motivated, according to a October 2017 government report.
Labour MP David Lammy hit out at politicians perpetuating inflammatory rhetoric, singling out those with a questionable record on promoting equality rights.
""To Rees-Mogg, to Nigel Farage, to Britain First, to the xenophobes, to the racists, to those who would be seduced by this extreme rhetoric ... We are standing up for the Britain that we love and that we believe in, and my God, we are sending a message to the [architect] of this tide of prejudice that is sweeping our world: Donald Trump,"" he told the crowd on Saturday.
Fardowsa Hadir said she felt the Muslim community was especially targeted in the UK.
""They don't acknowledge us, or that we are part of society,"" the 53-year-old told Al Jazeera.
She added there is a ""big"" problem with Islamophobia ""because everything that happens … they always blame Islam, and it's not fair"".
People also gathered to protest against what they branded the UK government's ""inhumane"" treatment of refugees.
Lammy said people should stand up to Prime Minister Theresa May's pledge - which she first made as home secretary in 2012 - to create a ""hostile environment"" for undocumented immigrants.
According to Refugee Council, in 2017, an estimated 668,600 people sought safety in Europe. Yet Britain received just 26,350 asylum applications, a 14 percent decrease from the year before.
Theo Sharieff blamed the Conservative party’s austerity policies for growing racism in the country.
He told Al Jazeera that ""immigrants held in detention are paid one pound [$1.40] an hour, are not allowed to look for jobs outside detention centres and have no right to join trade unions.""
The 22-year-old added that as the country ""cuts jobs, services and wages ..., all that does is put one worker against another.""
Sophie Hargrove said she was marching because ""leaders in the country across the world stand for things we don't believe in"".
She added that ""it's important to come together to oppose these things we are against"".
Asked about the Conservative party's attitude towards migrants and refugees, Hargrove branded it ""incredibly inhumane"".
""Especially now with refugee crisis, it's important to include refugees in this anti-racism because they are often forgotten and dehumanised,"" she told Al Jazeera.
""It's disgusting.""

The new arrivals are moving to parts of Rakhine state mostly ""cleared"" of its Rohingya residents, whose villages were bulldozed and reduced to muddy stains on a landscape of lush farmland.
The Rakhine migrants, who come from the poor but relatively stable south, are - for now - few in number.
But they carry great expectations as the pioneers of a donor-led ""Rakhinisation"" plan to upend the demography of the once majority-Muslim area.
""We were really afraid of those Kalars and didn't plan to come here,"" Chit San Eain, a 28 year old who has moved with her husband and toddler into a basic hut in Koe Tan Kauk told AFP news agency, using a pejorative term for Muslims.
""But now that they are no longer here, we have the chance to meet again with our relatives who live up here,"" she added, the ruins of a Rohingya settlement lying a few kilometres away.
Nearly 700,000 Rohingya have been driven from northern Rakhine into Bangladesh since August 25 last year by the Myanmar army, which has used attacks by armed Rohingya fighters as a pretext for its brutal campaign.
Another 300,000 Rohingya were pushed out from the south and centre of Rakhine by army campaigns stretching back to the late 1970s.
The UN has branded last year's military crackdown as ethnic cleansing, with a top official saying it carried all the ""hallmarks of genocide"".
Myanmar vigorously denies the allegations and says refugees are welcome to return.
But so far it has agreed to allow back only 374 of 8,000 refugees whose names have been put forward for the initial phase of repatriation.
Many traumatised Rohingya in Cox's Bazar camps are also refusing to be repatriated to Rakhine - where holding camps and hostile neighbours await them.
In their absence a blizzard of development projects, government and army-sponsored or privately funded, are transforming northern Rakhine.
Taking space vacated by fleeing Rohingya is an old game in a state seen as the front line of a Buddhist nation's fight against encroaching Islam.
""The military has been engineering the social landscape of northern Rakhine State so as to dilute the Rohingya population since the early 1990s,"" says Francis Wade, author of Myanmar's Enemy Within: Buddhist Violence and the Making of the Muslim 'Other'.
The Muslim minority are denied citizenship and labelled ""Bengalis"", outsiders who - the logic runs - have successfully been pushed back to their country of origin.
In a pattern with echoes of ""the Israeli settler project in the West Bank"" Buddhist communities then move in, altering the ""facts on the ground"" gradually rubbing out Muslim rights to the land, he added.
""I'd expect to see more Buddhists settle there over the coming years. And then we'll forget what the area once was, and that process of erasure will be complete.""
Chit San Ean is the beneficiary of the Ancillary Committee for the Reconstruction of Rakhine National Territory in the Western Frontier (CRR), a private scheme established shortly after the refugee crisis began.
In a zone under a strict army lockdown the resettlement plan could not fly without military consent.
Funded by ethnic Rakhine donors, the CRR's ambition is to establish a ""Muslim-dry"" buffer zone running the nearly 100km from state capital Sittwe to Maungdaw town, according to Oo Hla Saw, a Rakhine MP who advises the committee.
""All of this area was under the influence of Muslims. After the military operations, they had to flee ... so we have to establish this area with the Rakhine population,"" he told AFP.
The CRR will fund jobs and homes ""so this little population can grow and grow,"" he added.
It's a trickle so far, with around 64 households - some 250 people - moved by the CRR, with 200 more families on a waiting list.
They are among the poorest of the poor, mostly daily wage labourers from Thandwe around 600km to the south or squatters from Sittwe.
Two village tracts, Koe Tan Kuak near Rathedaung and Inn Din near Maungdaw, have been designated for the scheme so far.
The army concedes the second site was the scene of extrajudicial killings of Rohingya captives as violence engulfed the region last August.
Koe Tan Kauk was a similarly mixed settlement of Buddhist and Muslim homes.
The CRR-sponsored hamlet promises a rudimentary existence.
There is little work, no electricity or running water but donors have gifted each family a $450 shack on stilts, made from plywood and metal sheeting.
New residents hope to eventually own land, a prospect previously beyond their reach in Myanmar's second-poorest state.
Rakhine nationalists say the CRR is a bulwark against Islam and a means to ensure their ethnic group has a say in development projects driven by the Burmese-dominated central state, who they distrust deeply.
""Who should be given priority other than Rakhines in Rakhine State?"" explained Than Tun, General Secretary of the CRR.
For its part, Myanmar's government has enlisted powerful businessmen to rebuild the infrastructure of the battered state.
The army is running other projects including beefing up its security apparatus - in what appears to be a multi-pronged effort to keep out the Rohingya.
An Amnesty International report this week detailed how roads, helipads and security installations are being built, often on top of razed Rohingya settlements.
They labelled the activity a massive ""land grab"" that threatens to erase evidence of alleged atrocities, including at Inn Din.
Across northern Rakhine, abandoned land and rice fields have been commandeered by the army in an area with access tightly controlled to media, investigators and most aid groups.
The Rohingya lost their legal status in 1982, under a junta-era Citizenship Law. Now their ancestral lands are being stripped away.
That makes return impossible, according to legislator Oo Hla Saw.
""These people want to be recognised as 'Rohingya' ethnicity ... to enjoy citizenship, to resettle in their native grounds,"" he says. ""Their demands are unreasonable.""
Despite their dangerous new neighbourhood, the arrivals at Koe Tan Kauk say they are there to stay.
""I will end my life here,"" said a 69-year-old woman called Osar. ""I'm not going anywhere.""

https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/03/thousands-expected-stand-racism-london-180316011822511.html,refugee,693,Fri Mar 16 2018 09:21:02 GMT+0000,Claire Gilbody-Dickerson,Why thousands are expected to stand up to racism in London,"London, England - Thousands are expected to join an anti-racism march in London aimed at protesting against far-right groups in the UK and Europe.
The Stand Up To Racism event, scheduled to begin in central London at 12:00GMT on Saturday, will see campaigners and activists calling out institutional racism against migrants and ethnic minorities.
Demonstrations are expected to spread across the UK and European Union, with marches planned in Cardiff and Glasgow, as well as Paris, Berlin, Vienna, Amsterdam and Athens, coinciding with the United Nations' International Day for the Elimination of Racism and Discrimination.
The event comes after Mark Rowley, who recently retired as the Metropolitan Police's counterterrorism chief, warned that the far right poses an ""organised and significant"" threat to the country, as he revealed four far-right ""terrorist"" plots had been foiled since the beginning of the year.
According to Hope not Hate, Britain should brace itself for more far-right violence, claiming that 28 people were arrested or convicted for far-right inspired ""terrorist"" offences in 2017.
These include Darren Osborne, a white Briton who was sentenced to at least 43 years in prison after killing one person and injuring 12 as he drove a van into a crowd of Muslim worshippers outside a mosque in Finsbury Park in June.
Osborne regularly read material from former English Defence League (EDL) leader Tommy Robinson and the far-right Britain First group, among others.
A year earlier, in 2016, far-right gunman Thomas Alexander Mair killed Jo Cox, a Labour MP. Mair said he saw Cox, who was anti-Brexit, as a ""traitor to white people"".
According to a UN report, ""divisive, anti-immigrant and xenophobic rhetoric"" during the EU referendum campaign triggered a surge in hate crimes following Britain's June 2016 vote to quit the bloc.
The year between 2016 and 2017 saw the largest percentage increase in hate crimes since 2011 to 2012, with the number of reported offences rising to 80,393. The majority of those offences - 78 percent - were racially motivated.
Aaron Winter, professor
""[It is] no coincidence that at a time when we have Brexit and increased mainstream xenophobia, the far right is emboldened,"" Aaron Winter, professor at the University of East London and member of the university's terrorism and extremist centre, told Al Jazeera.
""An increase in the far right and hate crime has been linked to the environment and atmosphere around Brexit, which has normalised and mainstreamed Islamophobia and racism in the media and by politicians.""
Winter said this has an effect on policy-making, paving the way for widely reported cases where ""people get stopped at the borders and treated as though they don't belong to the country"".
He accused the government of having ""double standards"" as ""homegrown far-right extremists are treated much differently from Islamists"".
He explained that the far right enjoys significant media attention and is able to infiltrate the political landscape.
""Also, when one commits an act of terror, not all white people are seen as suspects. This is where we need to understand the differences in how Islamists and the far right are treated, but also where the double standards are.""
While Hope not Hate claims membership of far-right organisations in the UK is at its lowest in 20 years, an online presence is growing.
Labour MEP and Chair of the Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs Committee, Claude Moraes, is expected to address protesters at Saturday's march.
He told Al Jazeera: ""[The] significant threat of neo-Nazi and far-right terrorism in the UK [means it is now] thoroughly on the radar of British authorities.""
Moraes said the threat stems from a ""very strong populist wave based on anti-Muslim, anti-refugee rhetoric and an increasingly anti-Semitic one"", coupled with ""hardcore trends of the far right"".
Europe has recently witnessed far-right parties such as the Freedom Party in Austria, France's National Rally - formerly known as the National front - and AfD in Germany gain popularity.
""The huge development of the far right actually being in government now is an existential threat to the EU, people of colour and minorities, but is also disruptive to EU societies because it creates divisions between people,"" said Moraes.

The decision follows protests and a fire that took place at the centre on March 8.
The European Union set up five hotspots each in Italy and Greece, conceived as transit centres where migrants and refugees arriving on European coasts should be formally identified, registered, and channelled on to other centres shortly afterwards - normally within 48 hours - to either wait for deportation or continue with their asylum application.
Migrants and refugees protested the dire living conditions they are forced to endure as they are instead detained in the centre for weeks, and asked to be immediately transferred.
The authorities' decision came after NGOs and civil society organisations sounded alarm bells about conditions in the centre, which has seen several similar protests in the past.
At the end of January, about 40 people had sewn their mouths with white thread, while a Tunisian man committed suicide after a month in detention.
""The problem is that in a place where it is inhumane to stay even for a day, people sometimes stay for months, and that includes vulnerable cases,"" Gennaro Santoro, a lawyer with the Italian Coalition for Civil Liberties and Rights (CILD), told Al Jazeera.
Together with the Association for Juridical Studies on Immigration (ASGI) and IndieWatch, the organisation had requested the closure of the centre, which saw ""dramatic living conditions and systematic human rights violations"".
They also sought that vulnerable cases be transferred.
One of the cases Santoro's organisation took on board is that of a Tunisian family, a father and two sons, 14 and 15.
""One of the children had an artificial limb and was unable to ever leave the centre,"" Santoro said because migrants leave the centre through a hole in the fence.
Although they are unable to leave the island without papers, some migrants and refugees try to get on boats to the mainland anyway.
""The father arrived on January 15 and had already filed his asylum application,"" Santoro said, adding that he had come across several cases who had been detained for a month or two.
""Spaces occupied by minors and women could easily be accessed by others,"" the lawyer said.
""One of the families told us a child had witnessed an attempted rape against her mother. That same child was injured during the incidents on March 8.""
After a meeting between the mayor of Lampedusa and the Ministry of the Interior on Tuesday, the government said the centre would be closed for ""renovation work"" while migrants and refugees would be gradually transferred elsewhere.
The same statement, however, said services like identification and first aid would still be provided in case of emergency.
""There should be no new arrivals, but those who disembark on our coasts will be taken to the hotspot just for the time needed to be identified, and then transferred to the mainland,"" Salvatore Martello, Lampedusa's mayor, told Al Jazeera.
The Italian Red Cross, one of the service providers at the centre, welcomed the move but said no official procedure had begun to close the centre.
Forty people, including women and families, were transferred to the mainland on Wednesday, but these transfers had already been planned, leaving about 100 people living at the hotspot.
""The situation risked getting out of control due to the length of [the migrants'] stay,"" Debora Diodati, president of the Red Cross in Rome, told Al Jazeera.
""The 48-hour limit should be the rule and not the exception,"" she said, because the centre is ""not structurally suitable to host people for long periods"".
An independent body that monitors prisons and detention centres in Italy had first denounced the conditions inside the Lampedusa hotspot last year.
The guarantor for the rights of persons detained or deprived of personal liberty stressed in a press release that ""the interventions to be carried out in the hotspot should not be limited to mere renovation works"" if human rights are to be protected.
Costantino Saporito, who represents firefighters in the USB national workers' union, visited the centre after the fire.
He snapped and published pictures that show beds with no sheets a few centimetres from each other, dirty foam mattresses, filthy bathrooms and rubbish-strewn corridors.
""The problem is not only the fire on March 8,"" Saporito told Al Jazeera.
""The problem is that there have been two more fires before that, and that entire areas are closed - dirty, unfit to live in. And yet, some people, having nowhere else to go, sleep there.""
""The problem is systematic because procedures are not clearly defined,"" said Santoro, the lawyer, adding that complaints were filed last summer to the European Court of Human Rights on behalf of 14 minors detained at a hotspot in Taranto, in the southern region of Apulia.
""So, instead of being released within 48 hours or in the shortest possible time, these become places of indefinite detention.""

The summit, co-organised by Jordan, Sweden, and Egypt in the Italian capital, convened on Thursday at the headquarters of the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO), where foreign ministers from the three countries discussed the financial crisis confronting the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian Refugees (UNRWA).
More than 90 countries were invited to participate in the Rome conference, which was attended by Antonio Guterres, UN secretary-general, and Federica Mogherini, the European Union's foreign policy chief.
Also in attendance was Rami Hamdallah, the Palestinian prime minister, who called for increasing support and warned of the ""multiple risks that this financial crisis will have for Palestinian refugees"", their host countries, and the region's stability.
Among the pledging countries are Qatar, Canada, Switzerland, Turkey, New Zealand, Norway, South Korea, Mexico, Slovakia, India and France. Their combined commitment fell $350m short of the amount required by UNRWA.
UNRWA is one of the region's oldest relief agencies, but is currently facing an unprecedented financial crisis, according to Guterres, after US Department of State decided to withhold $65m out of a $125m aid package.
The move came after US President Donald Trump threatened on January 3 to cut aid to the agency, which serves more than five million people.
In a series of tweets, Trump had said: ""... We pay the Palestinians HUNDRED OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS a year and get no appreciation or respect.
""... With the Palestinians no longer willing to talk peace, why should we make any of these massive future payments to them?""
Trump's posts came less than a month after his controversial decision to recognise Jerusalem as Israel's capital, a move that prompted widespread international condemnation and led Palestinian leaders to say that they would ""no longer"" accept any peace plan put forward by the US.
The US had been UNWRA's largest donor, supplying nearly 30 percent of its budget.
Earlier on Thursday, Guterres said in a Twitter post that supporting UNRWA is an ""investment in peace"".
Supporting UNRWA is not only a matter of human solidarity with Palestine refugees, it is an investment in peace. #DignityIsPriceless
Speaking to Al Jazeera from Rome, Christopher Gunness, senior spokesperson for UNRWA, said they had started with a 2018 budget deficit of $446m - and although pledges for funding were made, there is ""work to do on the funding"".
According to Gunness, existing funds will only allow the agency to carry on with operations until summertime, and so a ""sustainable financial footing"" is required.
For nearly 70 years, UNRWA has been the lifeline to the more than five million registered Palestinian refugees in the occupied Palestinian territories and Lebanon, Jordan and Syria.
It offers support in food supply, access to education, healthcare, social services and employment.
The agency's commissioner-general, Pierre Krahenbehl, said in a Twitter post ""Palestine Refugees deserve recognition of their rights & stable delivery of UNRWA services"".
Similarly, Ayman Safadi, Jordan's foreign minister, noted that delivering vital services to Palestinian refugees is an ""international, political, legal, ethical and humanitarian responsibility"".

Hate crimes of this type - among them attacks and hate speech - soared to 133 last year, according to the Hellenic Police's statistics. In 2016, police documented 48 such crimes.
Meanwhile, the total number of hate crimes more than doubled from 2016 to 2017, growing from 84 to 184 incidents.
Greek police divide hate crimes into five motivating categories: race, national origin or skin colour (133); religion (28); sexual preference (29); sexual identity (12); and disability (nine).
Compared with 2016, last year witnessed a rise in hate crimes in all categories.
The largest increase took place in the category of sexual identity (crimes that target trans individuals), which grew from one instance in 2016 to 12 hate crimes last year.
Last year's numbers trump those recorded in 2013, which was the year with the highest number of hate crimes between 2012 and 2016.
With a spate of vigilante attacks, many of them fatal and carried out by the neo-fascist Golden Dawn party, 2013 saw 114 documented hate crimes.
The rise in the number of documented hate crimes last year was fueled by an ostensible increase in far-right violence targeting migrants, refugees and Muslims.
In a recent report, Al Jazeera detailed a string of violence targeting Pakistani labourers and Afghan refugees in Aspropyrgos, Athens and Piraeus, as well as a series of death threats against civil society organisations.
In Goritsa, an agricultural village in the Aspropyrgos area near the capital, the attacks reached a crescendo in October 2017, when a group of black-masked men attacked two Pakistani labourers working in a field.
The attack left 40-year-old Ashfak Mahmoud hospitalised after he was stabbed, bludgeoned with a stone and beaten with brass knuckles.
In central Athens, Mahdi, a 17-year-old Afghan refugee whose surname was withheld by Al Jazeera, was followed and beaten by a group of men who hurled Islamophobic and anti-migrant slurs at him.
Anna Stamou of the Muslim Association of Greece, a civil society organisation, described the rise in recorded hate crimes as ""very worrying"".
""The fascists in the previous years were afraid to expose themselves, but the crimes are now more open,"" she told Al Jazeera.
""This doesn't only impact the victims. The society is also very much deeply affected by this and loses faith in the system.""
Stamou added: ""Now, you look at the man in the supermarket next to you, and you wonder if he's a fascist or not. It has penetrated every layer of society.""
In the past, Golden Dawn, which has 16 seats in the Hellenic Parliament, was one of the main perpetrators of anti-migrant violence in Greece.
After a Golden Dawn member stabbed to death Pavlos Fyssas, an anti-fascist rapper, in September 2013, 69 party members were put on trial for operating a criminal organisation. That trial is ongoing.
Of the total number of hate crimes carried out in 2017, Greek police said at least 84 of the perpetrators were civilians, five were organised groups, 24 were police officers, 12 were both civilians and unknown actors and 59 were unknown actors.
A previously unknown group calling itself Crypteia - ostensibly a reference to a band of ancient Spartans who attacked slaves - took credit for an attack on an 11-year-old Afghan refugee's home on November 2, 2017.
The attackers threw beer bottles and stones at the home of the boy, who was identified in the local press only as Emir.
In January, the same group left a series of death threats on the voicemails of several civil society organisations, including the Muslim Association of Greece.
Earlier this month, Greek police arrested seven members of Combat 18 Hellas, a neo-Nazi group that has reportedly carried out more than 30 attacks on anarchist squats, left-wing social centres and Jewish memorials.
Petros Constantinou, national director of the anti-fascist group Keerfa, said he suspects that the new groups are linked to Golden Dawn.
""The reality is that we are still facing the Golden Dawn's neo-Nazis,"" he told Al Jazeera.
""There are small groups related to them. Practically speaking, they are using new names, but they are the same assault battalions as before.""
Constantinou added: ""For the last two years, they've been trying to make a comeback, but they are facing mass resistance from the anti-fascist movement.""
At the time of publication, Golden Dawn's press office had failed to reply to Al Jazeera's numerous requests for comment.

Australia's Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton, who oversees immigration and has drawn international criticism for heading a tough crackdown on asylum-seekers from Asia and the Middle East, said the South Africans deserve ""special attention"" for acceptance on refugee or humanitarian grounds.
He cited reports of land seizures and violence targeting the minority white farmers, who control a disproportionate share of the country's land.
""If you look at the footage, you hear the stories and you read the accounts, it's a horrific circumstance that they face,"" Dutton told Sydney's Daily Telegraph late Wednesday.
""I've asked my department to look at options and ways in which we can provide some assistance because I do think on the information I've seen people do need help, and they need help from a civilised country like ours.""
The offer was swiftly rebuffed by South Africa, with its foreign ministry saying that no section of the country's population was in any danger.
In a statement on Wednesday, South Africa's foreign ministry said: ""There is no reason for any government anywhere in the world to suspect that any South African is in danger from their own democratically elected government.
""That threat simply does not exist.""
The statement added that South Africa regretted that the Australian government ""chose not to use the available diplomatic channels to raise concerns or to seek clarifications on the land distribution process in South Africa"".
Dutton's comments come just months after asylum-seekers and refugees held by Australia in a remote Pacific camp were awarded Aus$70 million ($56 million) for being illegally detained and treated negligently in the country's largest human rights class action settlement.
Canberra, which denied liability, sends asylum-seekers who try to reach Australia by boat, rather than through official channels, to facilities on Nauru in the Pacific and Papua New Guinea's Manus Island.
Ian Rintoul, a spokesman for the Refugee Action Coalition in Sydney, said Dutton's comments were ""clearly racist"" and demonstrated the ""astounding hypocrisy"" of the Australian government.
""We've often joked that if it were White Zimbabwean farmers or White South African farmers arriving by boat in Australia, there wouldn't be any mandatory detention,"" he told Al Jazeera.
""When they are from Ethiopia, Sudan, Somalia, Iraq or Afghanistan, the attitude is very different. Boats are turned around, they are expelled to Nauru and Manus Islands.""
He added: ""It is a deliberate ploy to appeal to racist folk in the context of a government that is declining in the polls and is desperately appealing to those folk to maintain some popularity.""
Land ownership is a sensitive subject in South Africa, 24 years after the end of apartheid rule.
White people still own around 72 percent of individually-owned farms, with the black majority holding just four percent, according to a Land Audit Report published in November.
The country's ruling African National Congress (ANC) has backed expropriation of land without compensation.
South African President Cyril Ramaphosa has vowed to escalate the pace of redistributing land from wealthy whites to poorer blacks.
But any transfer would be done legally, he told parliament.
""I can say now that we will not allow land grabs. We will not allow land invasions and those who are tempted to resort to such activities must be warned in advance that we will not allow it because it is illegal, but apart from being illegal, it begins to violate the rights of other South African citizens,"" he said.

The refugee, referred to as Ahmed H in court proceedings, was also convicted on Wednesday of ""illegal entry as part of a mass riot"".
The charges stem from an incident on the Hungary-Serbia border in 2015, when a group of asylum-seekers tried to enter EU territory at the Roszke crossing, near the Hungarian city of Szeged.
""After more than two and a half years behind bars, this absurd decision comes as a devastating blow for Ahmed, his wife, and his two young daughters,"" Eda Seyhan, Amnesty International's campaigner on counterterrorism in Europe, said in an email to Al Jazeera.
At the time of the incident, Ahmed H, 41, was accompanying his elderly parents on their route from Syria to the EU at the peak of the 2015 refugee crisis. Hungary had tightened border controls to block incoming refugees.
Ahmed H - a legal resident of Cyprus - was previously convicted of ""terrorism"" charges in 2016 for throwing stones at police officers at the border crossing. A retrial was ordered in June after an appeals court decided that not all evidence was considered. It began in January.
Evidence at the retrial consisted mostly of videos and testimony from security officers on the border at the time of the incident.
A video showed Ahmed H telling police with a megaphone that asylum seekers ""came in peace"" and would not hurt officers during a tense standoff between refugees and Hungarian authorities.
Eventually, Hungarian police responded with tear gas and a water cannon. Many of the asylum seekers then threw objects, including rocks, at the officers.
During the retrial, Ahmed H admitted to throwing two stones after video evidence was shown.
Seyhan said none ""of the evidence against Ahmed constitutes an act of terror and his conviction was a blatant misuse of terrorism-related provisions"".
Amnesty also criticised Hungary's counterterrorism laws, saying they are ""vague"" and allow authorities to ""curb a number of rights"" without judicial oversight.
The Hungarian government says its counterterrorism provisions are similar to those of Western European nations.
The government's official Facebook page posted a photo album titled ""Ahmed H is a terrorist"" during the retrial in January.
When asked for comment, a Hungarian government spokesperson told Al Jazeera that prosecutors at the trial - as well as Parliamentary State Secretary of the Justice Ministry Pal Volner - took the position that Ahmed H's actions were an act of ""terrorism"", and the courts agreed.
The spokesperson quoted Volner as saying it's ""not possible to break through the border barrier in Hungary unpunished and throw stones at police within the framework of a mass riot"".
The government, headed by Prime Minister Viktor Orban, has taken a hardline stance against refugees, whom they refer to as migrants.
Orban said during a radio programme on March 2 that ""if we make the wrong decision, Hungary will become an immigrant country"".

Security forces have bulldozed houses and started constructing at least three new security facilities in Myanmar's western Rakhine state, said Amnesty International's Remaking Rakhine State report, which was published on Monday.
The report, which said construction of the three army outposts began in January, is based on satellite imagery and witness statements from Rohingya refugees.
""What we are seeing in Rakhine state is a land grab by the military on a dramatic scale. New bases are being erected to house the very same security forces that have committed crimes against humanity against Rohingya,"" Tirana Hassan, Amnesty's crisis response director, said.
""The new construction is entrenching the already dehumanising discrimination they have faced in Myanmar.""
Nearly 700,000 Rohingya have fled Myanmar since last August as a result of a government crackdown launched in the wake of deadly attacks on military posts by members of the Arakan Rohingya Solidarity Army (ARSA).
Eyewitnesses told Amnesty that Rohingya in Buthidaung township had been forcibly evicted from their homes to make way for the development. Al Jazeera was not able to independently verify those claims.
Myint Khine, a government administrator in Rakhine, told Al Jazeera the developments were not a ""military land grab"".
""We have been using bulldozers for building roads and construction ... not for military [purposes],"" Khine said.
Hundreds of Rohingya villages have been torched and at least 55 settlements completely bulldozed, since the ongoing crisis began, according to Human Rights Watch.
The majority of those displaced have sought refuge in neighbouring Bangladesh.
According to the UN, the exodus marks the fastest growing refugee crisis in the world.
Ro Nay San Lwin, a Rohingya activist, told Al Jazeera that Myanmar will ""never allow"" the Muslim minority to return to Rakhine state.
""It is clear that as a part of genocide they have destructed the Rohingya homes and confiscated everything,"" Lwin said. ""They will never allow the Rohingya to return to their original villages.""
The Rohingya, one of the most persecuted communities in the world, are not recognised as citizens of Myanmar and have for decades faced widespread discrimination from authorities.
Prior to the current exodus, tens of thousands of Rohingya have already been living as refugees in several neighbouring countries.
Myanmar and Bangladesh announced a repatriation deal in January, but rights groups and Rohingya have raised concerns about the agreement, saying it does not guarantee full citizenship or safety for those who return.
Laura Haigh, Amnesty's Myanmar researcher, told Al Jazeera the demolition of their villages has created an ""atmosphere of panic"" among the Rohingya.
""What we need to see is the Myanmar government saying this is Rohingya land and saving it for them,"" Haigh said.
""[Instead] there's a growing sense this [militarisation] is going to be a threat to safety and security, and there's worry about violence happening again.""
Although the Amnesty report refers to the construction of three security bases, in the Maungdaw and Buthidaung townships, there is growing evidence more facilities are being developed, Haigh added.
""Every time we go back to look at specific locations, we are seeing changes on a day-to-day basis. It's not just about the scale of change, it's also about the pace,"" she said.
The ongoing turmoil in Rakhine state has also created flashpoints between Myanmar and neighbouring Bangladesh.
Earlier this month, Myanmar deployed some 200 troops to its border with Bangladesh, close to a nearby strip of land between the two that is home to about 6,000 Rohingya refugees.
The area falls within Myanmar's territory but is widely referred to as ""no man's land"" because it lies beyond the country's border fence.
Myanmar said the move was part of an operation to target the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA) fighters operating in the region.
Security forces - who reportedly issued warnings using loudspeakers for Rohingya to leave the ""no man's land"" - were later pulled back after Bangladesh summoned Myanmar's ambassador over the incident.
Kyaw Win, founder of the Burma Human Rights Network, told Al Jazeera that Myanmar authorities are still attempting to force Rohingya remaining in Rakhine into Bangladesh.
""Burma is starving remaining Rohingya in Rakhine state and this is forcing them to flee,"" Win said.
On Monday, the UN's Special Rapporteur Yanghee Lee also said Myanmar's government appeared to be pursuing a policy of starvation.
Lee, who was reporting to the United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva, said the results of a UN fact-finding mission in Myanmar ""bear the hallmarks of genocide"" by the country's authorities.

However, the Sudanese Interior Minister Hamed al-Merghany denied that the topic was ever discussed at any level between the two countries, calling it a rumour.
“No respectable country will ever agree to act as a dumping ground for other countries’ problems,” he said, to Al-Sudani newspaper on Saturday.
The term ""bidoon"" literally means ""without"" in Arabic, and has come to be used for the community of stateless Arabs living in Kuwait.
The Bidoon, who make up more than 100,000 of Kuwait's population of three million, say they are the descendants of Bedouin tribesmen who failed to register for citizenship during the formation of the state in the 1940s through to the 1960s.
But the Kuwaiti government regards the ""Bidoon"" as illegal immigrants; claiming that the majority of them have Iraqi, Saudi or Syrian nationality, but they have hidden it in order to get the Kuwaiti citizenship.
Last week, Kuwait's National Assembly has approved the second reading of a draft legislation that would, if passed, allow the ""Bidoon"" people to serve in the army.
In April of last year, Kuwait's chief of general staff allowed ""Bidoons"" to join the country's ground and air forces.
At the time, however, Defense Minister Mohammed al-Khalid Al Sabah had said that only those stateless people whose fathers had served in the army would be allowed to join the country’s armed forces.

The anesthetised gaze in the children's eyes reflects their precarious health situation which worsens by the week.
They are sheltering from the scorching sun in the shadow of a bridge that connects Venezuela with Colombia. This a point of relief for many Venezuelans who have faced the hardship of a long trip fleeing the humanitarian and economic crisis facing their home.
Under the bridge, the crude reality of the migration crisis is impossible to miss.
About 550,000 Venezuelans left for Colombia at the end of 2017, according to migration authorities. There has been a 62 percent increase in the second half of last year, with many crossing on foot.
Among those fleeing are complete indigenous clans who are trying to escape hunger in Venezuela and are hoping to receive medical aid for themselves and their children in Colombia.
There are two main entrance points to get from Venezuela to the Colombian border city Cucuta. The Simon Bolivar Bridge, crossed daily by thousands and a symbol for the mass exodus of Venezuelan refugees, and the Francisco de Paula Santander bridge, a quieter border crossing under which rights groups are saying a humanitarian disaster is taking place.
It is here that a number of indigenous groups can be found. They either waded through the river or were able to cross the bridge before access was restricted.
Under the bridge, people rest on the ground as underfed toddlers with bloated bellies and babies with scabies roam around.
""The children are dying because of the lack of medicines and food,"" says the 38-year-old Remigio Segundo Romero Yordes.
Romero belongs to a complete indigenous Yukpa clan, of about 150 persons that left their ancestral lands of the Sierra de Perija, in Venezuela's Zulia state, just across the border.
At a distance of a few hundred metres, two additional Yukpa clans add to the more than 700 indigenous refugees who have crossed to Colombia, according to the local ombudsman's office of Colombia. The majority are living in dire conditions.
The ombudsman's office tells Al Jazeera that many of the children here have tuberculosis and are malnourished.
Nevertheless, staying in Venezuela was not an option according to Romero.
""When [Venezuelan President Nicolas] Maduro received power from [late President] Chavez, he terminated everything,"" Romero says. ""There is no food and there are no medicines.""
The indigenous hope to receive aid and support in Colombia and are determined to stay.
Last year, inflation in Venezuela reached at least 2,600 percent and this year it is expected to overtake 13,000 percent, according to the IMF.
Meanwhile, there are severe food and medicine shortages, which worsen every week. The homicide rate is among the highest in the world and the government has cracked down on opponents.
Most of the indigenous people who have fled to Colombia sleep in makeshift tents made from branches and rubbish bags.
Children can be seen playing cards under canopies. Some have a dry rash all over their body. Women often hang up clothes they washed in the dirty waters of the Tachira River, which is also used for consumption.
Today, the Yukpa survive by selling hats and baskets on the streets of Cucuta - a chaotic, dusty city and a sprawling open-air market for Venezuelan contraband goods.
Older women braid hats that are sold at the entrance of the bridge by a few men who try to get the attention of passersby.
They say they feel completely abandoned, adding that the Colombian government is not aiding them.
""Better said, they are threatening us,"" says Romero, who first arrived in August 2017.
He says that the Colombian government already deported them to Venezuela three times for not having valid identity papers, but they came back every time.
The municipality did not respond to Al Jazeera's request for comment.
The Yukpa belong to a binational tribe that lives on both sides of the border.
Olga Lucia Fuentes, a Colombian consultant in development, human rights and peace, says that Colombia's Constitutional Court ordered the state in 2009 to formulate plans to ethnically safeguard the survival of all Yukpas, whose existence was previously under threat by the Colombian internal conflict.
Most Yukpa do not possess identity papers, however, and it is hard for them to prove their binationality. Horacio Guerrero, Director of Indigenous Affairs of Colombia's Ministry of the Interior, said Venezuela did not respond it the ministry's request to establish the identity of the Yukpa. They are, therefore, treated as regular foreigners by Venezuelan authorities.
Colombia's President Juan Manuel Santos announced last month that only Venezuelans with a valid passport and holders of a migration border card, of which no new ones are issued, can enter Colombia.
According to Pedro Santiago Posada Arango, director of indigenous issues from the national Ombudsman's office in Colombia, however, the Yukpa are ""an indigenous border community [and] they have all the rights to enter Colombia, independently of whether they are registered in on or in both countries"".
He adds that the Yukpa ""should be treated as border peoples and therefore should receive help and attention"".
Posada stresses that the situation is very complicated and that there needs to be an assessment of those living under and near the Francisco de Paula Santander Bridge.
He says that errors have been made and that the regular requirements cannot be asked from the Yukpa, because of their special status.
Additionally, Christian Visnes, director of the Norwegian Refugee Council in Colombia, says Colombia signed up to the Cartagena agreement and, therefore, cannot deport refugees of any kind.
""Every person that has humanitarian needs should be received and their humanitarian needs should be attended,"" Visnes tells Al Jazeera.
He suspects that the state might be afraid of attracting more indigenous Yukpa if aid is given, but ""in this case, it's evident that there are humanitarian needs and, therefore, they should not be deported"".
For the Yukpa themselves, it is a matter of life or death.
""It's like escaping from boiling water and they throw us right back in,"" Romero explains.
""We will end up dead,"" he says as he fears the consequences of the grave health situation of his clan.
There is also distrust between the indigenous groups and Colombian authorities.
On a few occasions, when the Family Welfare state-institute handed out milk and bread, they also asked which children were ill, sometimes removing children from the makeshift camps.
""I haven't seen my baby in a month,"" wails Milagro, a 17-year-old mother, who only gave her first name, tells Al Jazeera.
Milagro watched as Family Welfare took away her child, she says, adding that she has no idea where her daughter was taken.
According to Gladys Navarro Uribe, president of the Colombian Red Cross - section Norte de Santander, the children who are removed are taken care of by the Family Welfare institute.
A source with Family Welfare, who asked not to be named, also says the Colombian state sometimes removes children found in ""vulnerability or in danger, and with health problems"". The source adds that the children are placed in substitute homes from the institute and are taken back as soon as they are ready to return.
Additionally, the source denies that the Yukpa are deported, but rather ""returned"" to their lands, adding that their presence under the bridge is a disturbance to the nearby neighbourhoods.
To compound the misery of the Yukpa, many often wade the river water to go back to the Venezuelan border to receive food - though rotten - that they cannot obtain on the Colombian side.
Indigenous women who fear being detained and deported, choose to wade through the deeper parts of the river to bring food, often carrying young children with them.
If they are caught, the food is often taken by Colombian customs authorities, the Yukpa say.
""Sometimes, the women take about 10 kilos. The DIAN [Colombian customs] take the food from them saying that it is contraband,"" says the 39-year old Bertilio Gonzalez, a member of one of the three Yukpa clans. ""This is for our consumption!"" Gonzalez adds.
DIAN authorities maintain that the food that is taken does ""not comply with sanitary standards"".
Such food seizures have led to violent confrontations between the Yukpa and the DIAN, illustrating a crisis that looks certain to deepen.
Back at the makeshift camp where Romero lives, he waves his arms as he goes on about the binationality of his peoples.
""They do not recognise us as indigenous, but rather as regular Venezuelans,"" he says.
""We can cross the border without documents!"" he says while walking through the rubbish.
""In the [Colombian and Venezuelan] constitution, the indigenous are recognised!""

The death toll, recorded by the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) - a UK-based war monitoring group - included 227 children and 154 women. At least 4,378 others were wounded.
""Warplanes covered the sky in Eastern Ghouta yesterday,"" Abdelmalik Aboud, an activist in the town of Douma, told Al Jazeera on Sunday.
""The shelling was focused on the underground shelters and mosques and the places that people have tried to hide in, due to the constant bombardment,"" he added.
The rising toll comes amid claims of yet another chemical attack overnight on the town of Arbin in Eastern Ghouta, a suburb of the capital, Damascus.
The Syrian Civil Defence, a volunteer rescue group also known as the White Helmets, said the Syrian government hit Irbin with chlorine gas, phosphorus bombs and napalm.
This is the second alleged chemical attack in a matter of days.
On Wednesday night, activists in residential the town of Hamouriyah released videos appearing to show phosphorus bombs being dropped and many victims struggling to breathe.
Syria's Deputy Foreign Minister Faisal Mekdad denied the reports during a press conference in Damascus on Thursday.
Mekdad said ""terrorists"" controlling the area and those who support them should be held accountable.
Eastern Ghouta has been under control of armed opposition groups since 2013 - two years into a popular uprising in Syria calling for the removal of President Bashar al-Assad.
With Russia's intervention in 2015, Assad's forces have been able to regain most of the rebel-held territory, but Eastern Ghouta remains one of the last armed opposition strongholds.
The area, home to some 400,000 people, has been under a suffocating siege by government forces since 2013, in an attempt to drain the armed opposition operating there.
Government forces, aided by a Russian aerial campaign, have managed to make major advances into the territory since the start of the latest offensive on February 18.
On Saturday, Syrian forces captured the largest town in Eastern Ghouta - Mesraba - effectively splitting the rebel-held enclave in three.
In addition to capturing Mesraba, government forces have also encircled the towns of Douma and Harasta, deep inside the enclave.
Aboud, the activist inside Douma, said many people were afraid.
""They are afraid of the government advance because they know that the regime is spiteful of Douma and Eastern Ghouta,"" said Aboud.
Syrian state media says government forces now control 51 percent of Eastern Ghouta.
""Encircling towns is something Syrian government forces have done consistently,"" Al Jazeera's Alan Fisher, reporting from Gaziantep on the Syrian-Turkish border, said.
""By cutting off roads and important supply lines, they've essentially left the fighters with no place to go,"" he added.
The Syrian government's offensive follows a pattern of previous assaults on opposition strongholds, deploying massive air power and tight sieges to force rebel fighters to accept ""evacuation"" deals.
These involve rebels surrendering territory in exchange for safe passage to opposition areas in northwest Syria, along with their families and other civilians who do not want to come back under Assad's rule.
On Friday, a number of rebel fighters were evacuated from Eastern Ghouta.
Jaish al-Islam, one of the main rebel groups in Eastern Ghouta, announced it had agreed to the evacuation of several Hay'et Tahrir al-Sham fighters - previously part of the al-Qaeda-linked al-Nusra Front - who were detained by the group in Eastern Ghouta.
According to Syrian state media, 13 fighters were evacuated with their families through the al-Wafeedin passage and bussed to Idlib province.
Marwan Kabalan, a Doha-based Syrian analyst, says the deal is part of Assad's strategy to divide and conquer.
""He's isolating the two big cities [Douma and Harasta] in Eastern Ghouta - he's weakening them and he's supporting this military approach through a political strategy - separating them on the ground while trying to strike a deal with Jaish al-Islam,"" Kabalan told Al Jazeera.
The United Nations' refugee agency representative to Syria, Sajjad Malik, entered the town of Douma in Eastern Ghouta on Monday accompanying an aid convoy.
When asked what he saw in Eastern Ghouta, Malik said the area was ""on the verge of a major disaster"".
""You walk in that town and you see destruction, you see displacement. There are dead bodies still in destroyed buildings. The smell is very strong in those areas,"" he said.
""There are people who are living in overcrowded basements. People coming out of those basements when we were there - it's hard to describe them. Their pale skin, you could see rashes on their skin, you can see that they're stunted.""

The fighters, including Abdullah, were killed in a strike on a TTP camp, the group said in a statement texted to local journalists in Pakistan's Bajaur district, which borders Kunar, on Wednesday.
According to the statement, 20 fidayeen, or suicide bombers, were killed, while another six fighters were wounded in the strike.
Prominent TTP commander Gul Muhammad and fidayeen trainer Yaseen were also killed in the strike, Pakistani newspaper Dawn reported.
Pakistan has often accused US and Afghan forces of not doing enough to target TTP forces resident on the Afghan side of the volatile Pakistan-Afghanistan border, where they fled following a series of military operations by Pakistan.
While violence has dropped in recent years, the TTP and its affiliates continue to carry out sporadic large-scale attacks targeting Pakistani security forces and civilians.
At least 748 civilians and security forces were killed in violence perpetrated by the TTP and other armed groups, included armed Baloch separatists, in 2017, down from a peak of at least 3,739 in 2012, according to the South Asia Terrorism Portal, a New Delhi based research organisation.
Pakistan's military says that it has killed at least 4,000 fighters working for the TTP and its allies since 2013.
Al Jazeera is unable to independently verify that number, as access to the conflict areas is strictly controlled, and the identities of those killed are seldom revealed.
Pakistani Foreign Secretary Tehmina Janjua is in Washington DC this week for talks with the US aimed at lowering tensions between the two erstwhile allies.
In January, US President Donald Trump cut more than $1.1bn in military assistance to Pakistan over allegations that it was providing safe haven to members of the Afghan Taliban and Haqqani Network.
Pakistan denies the charges, alleging that it is being scapegoated for the failure of US-led coalition forces to secure Afghanistan after more than 16 years of war.
Recent diplomatic contacts appear to be softening the divide between the two countries.
On Monday, senior US State Department official Alice Wells said the US recognised that Pakistan had ""legitimate concerns"" regarding the situation in Afghanistan.
""They have concerns over border management; over the [Pakistani Taliban's] presence in ungoverned space in Afghanistan; refugee concerns,"" she said.

Prosecutors accused the group of being driven by xenophobic, right-wing views and a Nazi ideology and of wanting to create a climate of fear that would drive out foreigners.
The individuals were members of the Freital Group, named after their base in the state of Saxony, a bastion of support for the right-wing Alternative for Germany (AfD), which won the most votes there in a September federal election.
After a year-long trial, Dresden's high court sentenced seven members of the group to between five and 10 years behind bars. The eighth got a youth sentence of four years, a spokeswoman said.
At least some of the defendants have appeared in court covering their faces with hoodies during their trial.
The charges against them included belonging to a ""terrorist"" organisation, attempted murder, setting off explosives, grievous bodily harm, attempted grievous bodily harm, and damage to property.
In one of the attacks cited by prosecutors, the suspects detonated explosives next to windows at a refugee shelter, knowing that there were people inside. One resident suffered cuts but prosecutors argued it was luck that no one was seriously hurt or even killed.
The suspects also set off explosives on a car belonging to a local politician from the Left Party.
The prosecutors say the group targeted refugees, aid workers, and leftist politicians and acquired large quantities of explosives in the Czech Republic that are illegal in Germany.
About one million refugees arrived in Germany in 2015 alone, many of them fleeing the war in Syria.
There were 950 attacks reported against Muslims and mosques in the country in 2017, according to new government figures.
According to the Interior Ministry, at least 33 Muslims were injured in the attacks, which included assaults against Muslim women wearing headscarves.

""We've always said that the legitimate grievances raised by the Taliban over justice, over corruption, over predatory governance of the past - those issues need to be resolved,"" said Wells at a press briefing in Washington on Monday.
Last week, President Ghani offered the Taliban peace talks ""without preconditions"", with a view towards recognising the armed group, which has been fighting US and Afghan forces for 16 years, as a legitimate political party.
Wells welcomed Ghani's proposal, saying the Kabul conference at which it was made was ""a really historic and benchmark event"".
The Afghan Taliban have yet to formally respond to the offer. The group has been resurgent in the battlefield in recent months, with a US watchdog reporting in October that 43 percent of the country was being contested between the Afghan government and the Taliban.
In January, a BBC study found that the Afghan Taliban directly controlled four percent of the country, but were openly active in 70 percent of Afghanistan.
Responding to a question on relations with Pakistan, Wells appeared to soften the US position on Afghanistan's eastern neighbour, with whom relations have been fraught since last year.
""Pakistan has a very important role to play in a peace process. We believe that Pakistan can certainly help to facilitate talks and to take actions that will put pressure on and encourage the Taliban to move forward towards a politically negotiated settlement,"" she said, pointing out that Pakistan had ""legitimate concerns"" in Afghanistan.
""They have concerns over border management; over the [Pakistani Taliban's] presence in ungoverned space in Afghanistan; refugee concerns,"" she said.
Pakistan and the US have sparred in a war of words since last August, when US President Donald Trump announced his Afghanistan and South Asia policy, singling out Pakistan for particular criticism.
In January, Trump cut $1.1bn in security aid to Pakistan, saying the country was not doing enough to fight elements of the Afghan Taliban and Haqqani Network allegedly present in its territory. Pakistan denies the charge.
Despite the aid freeze, diplomatic contacts between the two countries have continued, and Pakistani Foreign Secretary Tehmina Janjua is in Washington for high-level talks this week.
Her visit follows a trip to Islamabad by senior US National Security Council official Lisa Curtis last week.
""Ms. Curtis urged the government of Pakistan to address the continuing presence of the Haqqani network and other terrorist groups within its territory, and reiterated the international community's long-standing concern about ongoing deficiencies in Pakistan's implementation of its anti-money laundering/counterterrorism finance regime,"" a statement released after that visit said.
Pakistan recently faced an international setback at a meeting of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) in Paris, where it was decided to place the country on the international organisation's 'grey list', for not doing enough to clamp down on the financing of armed groups, including those that target regional rival India.

Aksoy told reporters in the capital Ankara on Tuesday that the camps are in the process of being built by the Turkish Red Crescent and Disaster and Emergency Management Agency (AFAD), according to state-run Anadolu Agency.
The spokesman said that the camps would be located in Idlib, as well as the areas of Azaz, Albil, Tugli, Tal Afar, Naddah, Bardakli and Mashad Rufi.
""We are regularly dispatching humanitarian aid, including shelter, food, and sanitary and medical supplies to the region,"" Aksoy said, adding that the establishment of new camps is in case of a large civilian exodus from Afrin.
Turkey launched an operation on January 20 against the US-backed Kurdish People's Protection Units (YPG) in its border stronghold of Afrin in northwestern Syria. Turkey sees the YPG as a ""terrorist"" group.
Aksoy also condemned Pentagon spokesman Colonel Rob Manning, who said the operation in Afrin harmed the efforts against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL, also known as ISIS) in northeastern Syria after Kurdish fighters there moved to Afrin to fight against the Turkish forces.
Aksoy criticised Manning for calling a senior member of the YPG a ""general"", according to the state media.
""The Pentagon spokesman once again continued to speak nonsense,"" Aksoy said.
Relations between NATO allies, Washington and Ankara, have been strained over a number of issues, notably the US arming of the YPG.
Turkey considers the Kurdish Democratic Union Party (PYD) in Syria and its armed wing, the YPG, to be ""terrorist"" groups with ties to the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), active in Turkey.
The PKK has waged a decades-long armed fight against the Turkish state that has killed tens of thousands of people.
Turkey has repeatedly called on Washington to stop working with the YPG.
The US, in return, has expressed concern about the current Turkish operation, dubbed ""Olive Branch"", and urged restraint from Turkey.

Andrew Gilmour, UN assistant secretary-general for human rights, made the remarks in a statement on Tuesday after speaking to newly-arrived Rohingya in Bangladesh's refugee camps on his four-day visit to Cox's Bazar district.
""The ethnic cleansing of Rohingya from Myanmar continues. I don't think we can draw any other conclusion from what I have seen and heard in Cox's Bazar,"" he said.
""It appears that widespread and systematic violence against the Rohingya persists,"" the statement said.
His statement also said it was ""inconceivable"" that any Rohingya would be able to return to Myanmar in the near future, despite Myanmar's pledges to start taking back some refugees. ""The Government of Myanmar is busy telling the world that it is ready to receive Rohingya returnees, while at the same time its forces are continuing to drive them into Bangladesh,"" Gilmour said. ""Safe, dignified and sustainable returns are of course impossible under current conditions.""
""The nature of the violence has changed from the frenzied blood-letting and mass rape of last year to a lower intensity campaign of terror and forced starvation that seems to be designed to drive the remaining Rohingya from their homes and into Bangladesh.""
The Rohingya, one of the most persecuted communities in the world, are not recognised as citizens of Myanmar and face widespread discrimination from the authorities.
Prior to the current exodus, tens of thousands of Rohingya have already been living as refugees in several neighbouring countries.
The plight of the Rohingya reached its peak in Myanmar six months ago when the country's military cracked down on the minority group in Rakhine State, sparking a mass exodus.
About 700,000 Rohingya have fled over the border to Bangladesh since the violence erupted in August, bringing with them consistent testimony of murder, rape and arson by soldiers and vigilante mobs.
Doctors Without Borders (known by its French acronym, MSF) has estimated that at least 6,700 Rohingya were killed in the first month of the crackdown alone. Hundreds of Rohingya villages were torched, and recent satellite imagery showed at least 55 villages have since been completely bulldozed, removing all traces of buildings, wells and vegetation.
Myanmar's military says its crackdown was needed to root out Rohingya armed rebels who attacked border police posts in August, killing about a dozen people.
In January, Myanmar and Bangladesh announced a repatriation deal, but rights groups and Rohingya have raised concerns about the agreement, saying it does not guarantee full citizenship, or safety, for those who return.

Special category: Last January, German police began registering Islamophobic crimes under a special category, after calls by the country's Muslim community to take more serious measures against the growing number of anti-Muslim hate crimes.
In most of the incidents, the perpetrators were part of Germany's far right, according to the ministry.
Death toll: In Germany, at least 33 Muslims were injured in the attacks, which included assaults against Muslim women wearing headscarves and attacks against mosques and other Muslim institutions, the Interior Ministry said in its reply to a parliamentary question.
The ministry recorded at least 60 attacks last year that targeted mosques and other institutions of the Muslim community.

Germany, a country of 81.8 million people, has the second-largest Muslim population in Western Europe after France.
Among the country's nearly 4.7 million Muslims, three million are of Turkish origin. Many of them are second or third-generations of Turkish families who migrated to Germany in the 1960s.
Rising trend: In Spain, details of anti-Muslim incidents were documented in the report ""Islamophobia in Spain 2017"" released Friday by the Citizens' Platform Against Islamophobia (PCI).
According to the report, a rising trend of prejudice against Islam was noted among various political views in Spain. Street, media and internet campaigns by far-right groups were also recorded, said the report.
Incident types: Out of the 546 Islamophobic incidents, 386 were media and internet-based while 48 percent comprised verbal attacks against Islam and Muslims.
Twenty-one percent of the incidents were against women, eight percent targeted men, four percent were directed against children and seven percent targeted mosques. There were also attacks against Muslim communities' businesses and associations.
By region: Of all the Islamophobic incidents documented by PCI in 2017, 51 percent occurred in the northeastern Catalonia region, followed by Andalusia with 22 percent and Valencia with 20 percent.

Why does Europe continue to be a 'terrorist' target?

https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/03/myanmar-defends-military-build-bangladesh-border-180302074720505.html,refugee,483,Fri Mar 02 2018 17:57:12 GMT+0000,None,Myanmar defends military build-up on Bangladesh border,"Myanmar on Friday defended deployment of its troops near the Bangladesh border, where thousands of Rohingya refugees have taken shelter, calling it an ""anti-terrorism operation"".
The move has drawn criticism from Bangladesh, which summoned Myanmar's ambassador on Thursday, while the UN refugee agency raised their concerns at the military build-up.
Some 200 troops were deployed to the border on Thursday, close to a nearby strip of land between Myanmar and Bangladesh that is home to makeshift camps housing some 6,000 Rohingya refugees.
The strip of land is officially designated as Myanmar territory but is widely referred to as ""no man's land"" because it lies beyond the country's border fence.
""We acted this way based on the information we got regarding terrorism, especially the Arakan Rohingya Solidarity Army (ARSA) movement,"" Zaw Htay, a spokesperson for the Myanmar government, told AFP news agency on Friday.
""It was not aimed at antagonising Bangladesh,"" Htay said.
Bangladesh has called for an immediate pullback of Myanmar security forces - who have reportedly issued warnings using loudspeakers for Rohingya to leave the ""no man's land"" - from the area.
Nearly 700,000 Rohingya have fled Myanmar since August following a government crackdown, which was launched in the wake of deadly attacks on military posts by the ARSA.
It is the fastest growing refugee crisis in the world, according to the United Nations, with the majority of the displaced seeking refuge in neighbouring Bangladesh.
The Rohingya, one of the most persecuted communities in the world, are not recognised as citizens of Myanmar and face widespread discrimination from the authorities. Prior to the current exodus, tens of thousands of Rohingya have already been living as refugees in several neighbouring countries.
Myanmar and Bangladesh announced a repatriation deal in January, but rights groups and Rohingya have raised concerns about the agreement, saying it does not guarantee full citizenship, or safety, for those who return.
Filippo Grandi, the UN high commissioner for refugees, said last month conditions in Myanmar are ""not yet conducive"" for the Rohingya to go back.
""The causes of their flight have not been addressed, and we have yet to see substantive progress on addressing the exclusion and denial of rights that has deepened over the last decades, rooted in their lack of citizenship,"" Grandi told the UN Security Council on February 13.
Rights group Amnesty International said last month Myanmar's history of discrimination and segregation of the Rohingya were early ""warning signs"" of the ongoing crisis.
""This episode will stand in history as yet another testament to the world's catastrophic failure to address conditions that provide fertile ground for mass atrocity crimes,"" Secretary-General Salil Shetty said on February 22.
""The transformation of discrimination and demonisation into mass violence is tragically familiar, and its ruinous consequences cannot be easily undone,"" he added.
The UN has said the abuses by Myanmar's military may amount to genocide.

https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/02/cut-throats-anatomy-greece-lynch-mobs-180226135614426.html,refugee,3895,Fri Mar 02 2018 11:47:32 GMT+0000,Patrick Strickland,'We will cut your throats': The anatomy of Greece's lynch mobs,"Goritsa, Greece - Scrawled in spray paint on a deserted building at the entrance to Goritsa, a Greek farming village on the outskirts of Aspropyrgos, is a large black X crossing out ""Anti-Fascist Zone"".
Inside the village, the walls of abandoned factories are blanketed in graffiti bearing crosshairs, a symbol of the neo-fascist Golden Dawn party. ""Aspropyrgos - Golden Dawn,"" one of the tags proclaims.
In a sprawling field on the periphery of Goritsa, Ashfak Mahmoud, a short, slender man in a billowing, navy blue raincoat and a black beanie, slides gloves onto his work-worn hands. He pulls a dull kitchen knife from his pocket and slices at the bulbous lettuce heads below.
Mahmoud is one of seven victims of anti-migrant violence and threats who spoke to Al Jazeera. Citing the low number of arrests stemming from the violence, they all accused the police of either acting too slowly or treating their cases with neglect.
The 40-year-old Pakistani worker walks to the edge of the muddy field, his galoshes squishing on the way. Pausing under the cloud-scattered sunlight on an otherwise bleak afternoon, he raises a finger in the direction of a rusty chain-link fence situated some ten metres away.
""That's where they were standing when I noticed them,"" he says of a group of Greek men who lumbered around and watched on as he worked in April 2017.
Mahmoud recognised the men from the town square, and he was suspicious of their intentions. During his two years in Gortisa's fields, he had witnessed several far-right vigilante attacks.
Hesitant at first, he eventually confronted the men, asking them what they were doing and if they were looking for trouble. One of the men snapped a photo of him on his iPhone, but they insisted they had no qualms with foreigners.
""They said that they like Pakistanis, that they are together with the Pakistanis, that they eat with Pakistanis often and that they had no problem with me,"" he recalls, ""and then they went on their way and left.""
Yet, from that day on, he suspected that his time would come. ""I was 100 percent sure that they were planning an attack,"" Mahmoud says.
Although many undocumented workers in Greece fear drawing the attention of authorities or the far right, Mahmoud joined the front lines of several anti-racism protests as violence soared in Aspropyrgos and the surrounding villages last year.
""There had been many racist attacks, and they [the far right] always saw me [at protests],"" he remembers.
""I was going to the hospital with victims and to the police station when they filed complaints. How could I not help when people were being beaten in front of my eyes?""
On October 7, 2017, Mahmoud's fears were realised when a band of five black-clad men in masks arrived in the fields that Saturday afternoon and confronted him and Waqas Hussein, his co-worker.
One of the men revealed a knife. Another swung a hail of punches in Hussein's direction, but most of them only connected with his chest.
They both turned to run. Hussein escaped, but Mahmoud was not so lucky.
He slipped and tumbled down. Punches and kicks thudded against his body. Within moments, he had been stabbed in the face, bludgeoned with a stone and pounded with brass knuckles.
""One by one, we will cut your throats,"" the assailants said, according to Mahmoud, with the blows still striking him. ""We will burn you alive in your houses. Don't think we'll leave you [alone]. If you go to the police, you can be sure it will be worse next time.""
He was subsequently hospitalised and treated for his injuries, but Mahmoud says that he still feels pain under his right eye, where a scar remains.
Javed Aslam, president of the Pakistani Community of Greece association, documented upwards of 70 attacks on migrant labourers in the Aspropyrgos area between April 2016 and October 2017.
Aslam, who said he began to receive near daily phone calls from field workers as the bloodshed escalated, explained that the attacks in Aspropyrgos soared during the summer of 2017.
He found himself shuttling back and forth to the area regularly to take the testimony of victims, urging them to file police reports and speak out against the campaign of intimidation. ""They want to kick [Pakistanis] out of this area,"" he says grimly.
Having tracked anti-migrant violence for more than a decade, Aslam sees only one possible culprit: Golden Dawn.
After years of Golden Dawn carrying out violence against migrants in Greece, several journalists and political opponents echoed Aslam's suspicions.
In October, after Mahmoud and Hussein were beaten in Goritsa, the Golden Dawn, which has 16 seats in the Hellenic Parliament, decried accusations of its involvement as ""slanderous attacks"" on the party.
""We condemn violence - in total and not casually - and we continue our legitimate and righteous struggle for the liberation of Greece,"" its statement said, blasting its accusers as ""corrupt"".
In a controversial meeting days later, Golden Dawn leader Nikolaos Michaloliakos assured Khalid Usman Qaiser, Pakistan's ambassador in Athens, that his party was not responsible for the incident.
At the time of publication, the Golden Dawn's press office had not replied to Al Jazeera's request for a comment.
Acknowledging the shocking nature of the attack on Mahmoud and Hussein, Tina Stavrinaki, a spokesperson at the Athens-based Racist Violence Recording Network, a coalition of groups monitoring and documenting xenophobic attacks, said: ""It reminds of so many others from before.""
Anti-migrant violence is not new in Greece, where squads of Golden Dawn members and other far-right vigilantes brought a spate of brutal attacks to a fever pitch in 2012, the same year the far-right outfit surged in the elections and first landed its legislators in the parliament.
The Racist Violence Recording Network documented 154 attacks that year. Of that total, all but three targeted refugees and migrants.
The following year, the violence peaked at 166 attacks - 144 of which targeted refugees and migrants - that racked up a tally of at least 320 victims. Almost half of the total number of those attacked were shot.
That same year, a pair of high-profile killings rocked the country. In January 2013, two assailants believed to be linked to the Golden Dawn stabbed Pakistani migrant Shahzad Luqman seven times, leaving him in the street to die.
Nine months later, in September, Giorgos Roupakias, a cafeteria employee in the Golden Dawn's office, stabbed to death anti-fascist rapper Pavlos Fyssas in Piraeus, the port city adjacent to Athens.
After the murder of Fyssas, anger erupted in the streets, with anti-fascists, anti-racists and leftists rallying regularly against the Golden Dawn.
The violence receded to a temporary standstill when dozens of Golden Dawn members were arrested for allegedly operating a criminal organisation.
Today, 69 party members, including the entire parliamentary group from the 2012 elections, are still on trial, and the legal proceedings have moved at a snail's pace.
In 2014, the number of hate crimes against refugees and migrants recorded by the Racist Violence Monitoring Network sunk to 46.
Tina Stavrinaki, communications officer at the Racist Violence Recording Network
In 2015, 75 incidents involved assaults on refugees and migrants were documented. In 2016, a comparably low number, 31 incidents, involved attacks on refugees and migrants.
But last year witnessed a crescendo of anti-migrant violence, with at least 47 attacks motivated by race, skin colour or national origin in the first six months alone, according to statistics provided to Al Jazeera by the Hellenic Police.
""In general, we do not think we are back in a situation like 2013, but what we also have is this feeling that we are right before the big wave of violence by Golden Dawn,"" Stavrinaki says. ""Extremist xenophobic groups are not as afraid as they were during the first part of the trial of Golden Dawn.""
In an email to Al Jazeera, a police spokesperson denied accusations of impunity for far-right violence, insisting that the force can only file charges at the behest of the prosecutors' offices.
Mahdi*, a 17-year-old Afghan refugee who arrived in Greece with his mother and four siblings two years ago, described being followed, beaten and left bleeding on the pavement three months ago.
Sitting in a smoke-filled Afghan cafe in Exarchia, an Athens neighbourhood where many anarchists and leftists are based, Mahdi describes the incident, which left him with impaired hearing and chronic dizziness.
Around 8:45pm on November 19, 2017, he was walking home to join his family at their flat in the Platia Amerikis area of the capital when he noticed that four men had been following him for more than half a kilometre.
He reached an intersection and saw that two more men, both dressed from head-to-toe in black, were waiting there on a motorcycle. As he passed, one of the men lifted the face mask of his helmet and ordered the four following Mahdi to grab the teenager.
""I said to myself, 'I hope they just want to rob me and not kill me',"" he remembers, adjusting his rectangular, black-rimmed glasses nervously and rubbing his eyes as he tells the story.
He turned when he heard the men running nearer behind him and removed his glasses to shield his eyes. A fist landed on his temple, and Mahdi fell from the pavement onto the hood of a parked car. The men, one of whom wore a sharp ring, took turns hitting him.
Mockingly, one of the assailants said to the others: ""Don't hit him, guys, he's just a poor immigrant.""
The blows pounded his face and torso.
Cars passed by, but no one stopped to intervene, he says. ""F*** your mother,"" his attackers screamed. ""F*** your religion, terrorist. Go back to your country.""
He eventually broke free and rushed into his apartment.
Activists from Keerfa, the anti-racist group of which he is a member, rushed over and took him to the hospital. The next morning, he filed a police report at a station 600 metres from the site of the attack.
Investigators told him they could not find any witnesses and no security cameras caught the incident. Outraged by what he perceived as indifference on the part of the police, he cut off communication with them.
""They know what is happening in that area because a church in [the nearby square] Agios Panteleimonas is a meeting point for fascists,"" he insists.
Mahdi, 17-year-old Afghan refugee
""It was a racist attack, and in that area the people doing this stuff the most are Golden Dawn,"" Mahdi argues.
""I had heard about the far-right people before coming to Greece, but I never expected this. We also heard that people here are very welcoming,"" he continues.
""Of course, fascists and racists are a threat to both Greeks and migrants,"" he concludes, alluding an incident in which Golden Dawn members beat and hospitalised 24-year-old Alexis Lazaras, a university student, last March in an Athens suburb.
""But it's like the police don't care because it's just another report they have to file and that's it.""
Mahdi's beating came just two weeks after a group calling itself Crypteia, a reference to an ancient band of Spartans who committed atrocities against slaves, assaulted the home of an 11-year-old Afghan boy in Athens.
Identified in the local press only as Emir, the boy saw his home targeted after he was flung into the national media when his school blocked him from carrying a Greek flag during a parade commemorating Greek resistance during the second world war.
On November 3, 2017, stones and beer bottles crashed through Emir's windows. ""Leave from here, and go back to your village,"" read a note left behind by the attackers.
Claiming to be a member of Crypteia, a previously unknown group, an anonymous caller phoned a Greek news outlet and claimed credit for the incident.
In January, Crypteia claimed responsibility for a series of death threats left on the voicemails of several civil society organisations, including the Muslim Association of Greece.
""We are the group that kills, burns, hits and tortures immigrants, mainly Muslims,"" the caller said, according to the Muslim Association of Greece's Anna Stamou, who spoke to Al Jazeera at the time.
Observers and analysts have cast doubt on the group's authenticity, noting that Golden Dawn - as well as being Islamophobic - opposes non-Greeks carrying the flag in parades.
Dimitris Psarras, an Athens-based investigative journalist at the Efimerida Sintakton newspaper and author of The Black Bible of Golden Dawn, doubts that Crypteia is separate from Golden Dawn.
""I think it's ridiculous and that [Crypteia] doesn't exist,"" he speculates, organising papers at his desk.
""Some party members want to remake the past violence of Golden Dawn before the end of the trial.""
In Renti and Nikaia, working-class neighbourhoods in Piraeus, attacks were similar, with assailants bearing masks and draped in black attire.
In these boroughs, at least 30 homes where migrant labourers reside were attacked during the two weeks following Christmas 2017, according to Keerfa, an anti-racist activist group based in Athens.
Nawaz Muhammad, 27, who came to Greece nine years ago with the hope of supporting his family back in Pakistan, was among those who saw their homes targeted in Renti, he explains on a pale afternoon in early January of this year.
Around 11:00pm on January 4, stones came crashing through his window, flinging shattered glass across the bedroom floor.
Then, a torrent of oranges followed, thudding against the walls and wooden shutters. Beer bottles came next, bursting into fractured shards on the concrete balcony.
When Nawaz rushed to the window after the first stone entered his home, he saw a group of men under the glow of the adjacent streetlight. They were winding up to throw slabs of jagged concrete in his direction.
With their faces covered, the men hurled racist insults at Nawaz as he watched on. ""Leave our country, you dirty Pakistanis,"" they bellowed. ""We won't let you stay here.""
Sitting on a bare mattress in his austere, third-storey apartment, frustration swallows his face as he explains that, according to his estimation, the January 4 incident was the twentieth attack on his apartment block since late November.
""They have been trying to provoke us to come down,"" he guesses, ""but we won't make that mistake.""
Nawaz lives with his younger brother and a friend, and when the first attack happened, they chalked it up to drunkenness, assuming a band of teenagers had been looking for trouble after a night at the bar.
Then, two more attacks happened that week, and two to three like them every week in the following month. With each incident, the attacks appeared more and more like part of an organised campaign.
Fearful of police, the migrant labourer and his roommates were reluctant to report the incidents at first. Yet, when the black-clad assailants continued to show up, they eventually called for help.
""At first, they said there was nothing they could do,"" he recalls.
Weeks later, only after local Greek TV crews showed up and reported on the violence, police took their testimony. At the time of publication, no arrests have been made.
Speaking to Al Jazeera, Petros Constantinou, national director of Keerfa, argues that the flurry of attacks suggested Golden Dawn was ""training new fighting squads"".
""The hardcore Nazi caucus in Golden Dawn wants to say 'Enough with the legal processions and the trial, let's get back to the attacks',"" he says.
""Practically speaking, in the areas of Renti and Nikaia, they are trying to educate a new generation of fascists. It was obvious to us because they are using young people there.""
Syed Qurban Shah, a 64-year-old who ventured from Pakistan to Greece in 1994, works in a nearby ice factory. He scoops up an orange from the brown tract of dead grass and dried mud in front of his apartment building.
""They brought this to throw at us - there aren't even orange trees here,"" he says, motioning to a scatter of mashed fruit on the ground.
Grabbing a sharp stone, he shakes his head ominously and adds: ""They threw these also.""
Down the road, 45-year-old shop owner Javid Nasser said his minimarket, which he has run for six years, has been attacked more than 15 times since the end of November 2017. In mid-December, his house was also vandalised.
Standing behind the counter in his store, Nasser picks up the phone to take a delivery order, jotting down a list of groceries before gently putting down the receiver and continuing his account of the violence.
Having lived in Greece for the last 20 years, he explains that until four months ago there had been few attacks in the Renti area during the period after Golden Dawn was put on trial.
""During the first attack, they entered and realised it was a shop belonging to a foreigner,"" he says. ""They said, 'You have to leave our country, you're dirty and you take our jobs'.""
The attacks mirrored others in the area: the assailants hurled oranges and bottles at his store front.
Around the corner, young men have on several occasions pelted a makeshift mosque with tomatoes and sprayed ketchup on its entrance, Nasser says.
""I've called the police more than 15 times, but they've only come once to take a report,"" he recounts, explaining officers only showed up after an adjacent Greek-owned store was mistakenly hit with bottles and oranges.
""I pay taxes and live here with papers … Why don't they help?"" Answering his own question, he says: ""They don't care because we are foreigners.""
Standing aside Nasser between the aisles of the minimarket, Qurban Shah chimed in: ""The jobs we have - they could never do them. Try waking up at 3:00 in the morning.""
Back in Goritsa, other victims of anti-migrant attacks decried the apparent culture of impunity that allows for the attacks to continue unabated.
Latif Abdul, 48, came to Greece a decade ago intending to support his wife and two kids in Pakistan's Islamabad. Yet, an April 2017 attack left him unable to work consistently.
Abdul sits on a porch, stuttering as he speaks, a condition he says is a result of the assault.
In January 2017, after months of hearing rumours of attacks, Abdul first witnessed a fellow field worker being stomped by a mob of far-rightists.
Paralysed by fear, he stood and watched on until one of the assailants threatened him. He fled the scene, but Abdul says he still didn't expect he would eventually become a target.
Two weeks later, he laid on his bed and drifted off shortly after nightfall. The smell of smoke woke him from his sleep. He rushed outside to see grey plumes rising from his jerry-built home. In a distant field, a group of masked men were sprinting from the site.
He eventually repaired the home, but he grew increasingly fearful. One evening in April, he was alarmed when he heard his guard dogs barking loudly. He stepped outside to see what was happening. At first, he didn't see anyone.
Then, as he turned around to step back inside, a powerful blow struck the back of his head.
He hit the ground and rolled onto his back, and a group of men wearing brass knuckles appeared above him.
They struck his head repeatedly with the knuckledusters. ""Go back to your country, a**hole,"" he heard them shouting before he lost consciousness.
Abdul woke up in the hospital later that night. When his boss took him to the police station to file a report the next morning, he says, officers said they could not do anything to help because he is in the country illegally.
The police subsequently held him in a holding cell for three days.
""I feel dizzy and sick sometimes, and I have trouble focusing,"" he says, explaining that he has been denied medical treatment several times owing to his lack of legal residency papers and health insurance.
""When I can't work, I don't get paid,"" he says, ""but my boss brings me some potatoes and onions, so I can at least eat something.""
While he describes the hardships he has endured since last April, his two guard dogs mull around the yard, sniffing for scraps.
Until last week, he had five dogs, but three were killed just days earlier when someone threw poisoned meat into his yard. He wonders if it indicates someone is planning to attack him again.
With a trace of sadness in his voice, he concludes: ""I've been here for 10 years, and I've never hurt anyone. All I do is collect metal and cartons. They don't have a reason to do this; they're just a**holes.""
Although the attacks halted after Ashfak Mahmoud and Waqas Hussein were targeted in October, migrant workers in Goritsa fear the pause may be temporary.
Shortly after dusk one evening in early February 2018, 23-year-old Muhammad Naseef, who has worked in Goritsa since migrating to Greece five years ago, was picking lettuce in the field.
He looked up to the adjacent gravel road, one of several unnamed streets dissecting Goritsa's fields, as a small sedan slowed to a halt.
""Come here,"" the driver shouted in his direction. ""We want to ask you for directions.""
Initially unable to see well, Nafees started in the direction of the car.
When the driver and three passengers opened their doors and stepped out, however, he noticed they were wearing masks and brass knuckles. ""No, I won't come over,"" he replied sharply, turning and dashing away through the field.
Muhammad Nafees, 23-year-old Pakistani labourer
With the help of the Pakistani Community of Greece, Nafees filed a police report at the local station the following day. ""As usual, they did nothing,"" he recalls. ""I told my boss, but he said there is nothing he can do for me. He just told me to keep doing my job.""
Walking back to the field after a brief cigarette break, he says: ""I'm worried. I've seen what they've done to other people here.""
For his part, Mahmoud admitted that the violence has instilled a sense of fear in him. ""It's a big problem,"" he says. ""Until now, I am afraid they could kill me.""
After he was attacked, Greek television reporters lined up to interview him. Leading politicians, including then Migration Minister Ioannis Mouzalas, visited his home, posing for photos and condemning the violence at every opportunity.
Three teenagers with far-right ties were arrested following the incident, but nearly six months later, Mahmoud has received no additional updates from the police.
The fields have thinned throughout the last year, with many workers leaving Goritsa for safer areas.
He walks through the stretch of green farmland, stopping to point out the shell of a nearby deserted home. Several of the remaining concrete blocks are partially charred.
""Two workers, Jaafar and Nasser, used to live there,"" he says. ""They left after their home was burned down.""
Despite his fears, he refuses to join his colleagues who left and moved on to jobs elsewhere.
""I'm also afraid that if I leave they'll see the violence works, and I don't want that,"" he concludes.
""If I go, hundreds of others could see it and leave also. In the end, they [the attackers] would succeed.""

Shirin Ebadi of Iran, Mairead Maguire of Northern Ireland and Tawakkol Karman of Yemen made the accusation during a press conference on Wednesday in Dhaka shortly after visiting Rohingya refugee camps in the southern Bangladeshi district of Cox's Bazar.
The mission of the Nobel Women's Initiative was launched so that the three Nobel laureates could witness the plight of Rohingya women in the squalid refugee camps.
They urged Myanmar's defacto leader Aung San Suu Kyi to condemn the violence against Rohingya refugees or possibly face prosecution for genocide.
Aung San Suu Kyi ""is directly responsible for the crimes perpetrated against the Rohingya Muslims,"" said Ebadi, who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2003.
The three called on Aung San Suu Kyi, the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize winner, to stop the persecution of the minority group.
""Our Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi, she is the chancellor of the Myanmar government, and she is silent, she did not tell the truth to the world ... she should wake up and stop this genocide,"" said Karman, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2011 along with Liberia's Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf and her compatriot Leymah Gbowee.
""As Nobel laureates, we accuse the Myanmar government and the military of the crimes of genocide. That is why we plan to take the Myanmar government to the International Court of Justice,"" said Maguire, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1976 for conflict resolution in Northern Ireland.
Nearly 700,000 Rohingya Muslims fled to Bangladesh after Myanmar's military launched an offensive against suspected Rohingya militants in northern Rakhine State on August 25. The United Nations and the United States say the government's actions amount to ethnic cleansing.

Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein - in a passionate reprimand of the Security Council's permanent member states - said on Monday that responsibility for the continuation of ""so much pain"" lies in particular with Russia, China, and the United States, which he accused of misusing their veto power.
Speaking to the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva, Switzerland, in his last speech before his four-year term expires, Zeid did not mince words.
""Second to those who are criminally responsible - those who kill and maim - the responsibility for the continuation of so much pain lies with the five permanent members of the UN Security Council,"" he said.
""So long as the veto is used by them to block any unity of action when it is needed the most, when it could reduce the extreme sufferings of innocent people, then it is they - the permanent members - who must answer before the victims.""
He said France and the United Kingdom had shown leadership in championing a code of conduct on the use of the veto, which is supported by 115 nations.
""It is time for the love of mercy that China, Russia and the United States join them and end the pernicious use of the veto,"" said Zeid, whose expires in August.
Zeid also highlighted inaction in the ""most prolific slaughterhouses"" such as Syria's Eastern Ghouta; the Ituri and Kasai regions of the Democratic Republic of Congo; the embattled city of Taiz in Yemen; Burundi; and Myanmar's Rakhine state.
A crackdown by security forces in Myanmar's northern Rakhine state has driven nearly 700,000 Rohingya people across the border into Bangladesh since last August, leading the UN to accuse the government of an ethnic-cleansing campaign against the Muslim minority who face acute discrimination in the mainly Buddhist nation.
Three Nobel Peace Prize winners have visited refugee camps in Cox's Bazaar, Bangladesh, and urged their fellow laureate - Myanmar's de facto leader Aung San Suu Kyi - to acknowledge the atrocities against the Rohingya.
""This is genocidal rape, torture, murder of the Rohingya people,"" Mairead Maguire, the 1976 Nobel Peace Prize winner, told Al Jazeera.
""I would like to ask our sister laureate to go to the villages - that mostly have been flattened and destroyed. I would like Aung San Suu Kyi to accompany us to the villages of the Rohingya and actually acknowledge they're human beings,"" said Maguire, breaking down in tears.
EU countries on Monday demanded sanctions against senior Myanmar military officers over ""serious and systematic"" rights abuses against the Rohingya.
EU foreign ministers meeting in Brussels said the situation in Myanmar was ""extremely serious"", pointing to widespread abuses by the military, ""including rape and killings"".
The ministers tasked the bloc's diplomatic chief Federica Mogherini with making ""proposals for targeted restrictive measures against senior military officers of the Myanmar armed forces responsible for serious and systematic human rights violations without delay"".

Peter Marki-Zay, an independent candidate endorsed by the majority of Hungary's opposition parties, handily won Sunday's election in southern Hodmezovasarhely against Fidesz candidate Zoltan Hegedus, garnering 57 percent of the vote to Hegedus's 41 percent.
Hodmezovasarhely has been run by Fidesz since 1990, two years after the party was founded.
For many in Hungary, the vote was a referendum on Fidesz corruption.
Attila Vajnai, a left-wing politician from Budapest, told Al Jazeera, ""The people of Hodmezovasarhely ... voted for the elimination of corruption"" instead of Fidesz's far-right rule.
The corruption is tied to high-ranking members of Fidesz in both Hodmezovasarhely and broader Hungary, Vajnai said.
Janos Lazar, the man who has run the office of Prime Minister Viktor Orban since 2012, is a former mayor of Hodmezovasarhely.
He is currently embroiled in the ""Elios"" corruption scandal involving EU funds used to build public lighting in Hungary.
The scandal involves several Hungarian companies, including Elios, owned by Orban's son-in-law Istvan Tibocz, which made huge profits while installing subpar lighting in population centres across the country.
An investigation by the EU's anti-fraud agency OLAF found Elios was selling parts for the lighting projects at up to 50 percent markups.
OLAF has demanded that the EU commission retrieve 40 million euros (nearly $50m) in financing given to the Hungarian government for the project.
""Corruption was fundamental in this election,"" Peter Kreko, director of the Political Capital Institute, a Hungarian think-tank, told Al Jazeera.
Hodmezovasarhely was directly impacted by the scandal. Lighting in the city is inadequate for its residents, Kreko said.
The Elios scandal and others impact voters across the nation, and discontent with corruption was enough to shield Marki-Zay from a smear campaign, analysts say.
The mayor-elect lived in the US for years, so pro-Fidesz media painted him as an ""American spy"", Kreko explained.
There were also attempts to link Marki-Zay to George Soros, the Hungarian-American billionaire that has drawn the ire of Fidesz for his funding of progressive causes and support of refugees.
The Hungarian government has been accused of running an ""anti-Semitic"" campaign against Soros.
At the time of the election, bus stops and billboards across Hungary bore advertisements saying Soros wants to settle ""millions"" of Africans and Middle Easterners in the country.
Still, the ""Soros boogeyman"" wasn't enough to stop Mark-Zay, who is a well-known figure in Hodmezovasarhely, Kreko said.
After the defeat was announced, Orban said Fidesz must ""fight harder"" to win elections.
Orban is credited with coining the term ""illiberal democracy"". His right-wing party often quarrels with Brussels on refugee-related issues and civil liberties.
Fidesz is projected to win a majority of seats in parliament in the April 8 vote, but it could fall short of the numbers required to form a government on its own.
Polls show Jobbik, a populist party that many consider far-right, coming in second.
Hungary has more than 100 political parties and Jobbik, which called the results in Hodmezovasarhely ""a slap in the face"" for Fidesz, has only agreed to work in a coalition with three or four.
If the opposition learns a lesson from the shocking upset, ""corruption issues should be turned into easily understandable, local issues"" for opposition candidates with broad support to champion, Kreko said.
This strategy could stop Fidesz from winning a supermajority, or even enough seats to form a government.
""If you have one serious candidate against the Fidesz candidate, then victory is doable … but Hungarian opposition parties are stubborn. You never know what they will do,"" Kreko said.

Almost two-thirds of the population will need food aid this year to stave off starvation and malnutrition as aid groups prepare for the ""toughest year on record"", members of a working group including South Sudanese and UN officials, said.
“The situation is extremely fragile, and we are close to seeing another famine,"" Serge Tissot of the UN Food and Agriculture Organization in South Sudan said.
""The projections are stark,"" he added.
""If we ignore them, we’ll be faced with a growing tragedy.""
A total of 5.3 million people - 48 percent of the population - are already in a ""crisis"" or ""emergency"" situation, according to a survey published by the working group.
“We are expecting to face the toughest year on record,"" UN Humanitarian Coordinator Alain Noudehou told reporters in the South Sudanese capital Juba.
The oil-rich east African nation, which gained independence from neighbouring Sudan in 2011, has been torn apart by an ethnically-charged civil war since late 2013, when troops loyal to President Salva Kiir and then-Vice President Riek Machar clashed.
Since then, more than four million people have been forced to flee their homes, creating Africa's biggest refugee crisis since the 1994 Rwandan genocide.
Machar and Kiir signed a peace deal in August 2015 and formed a unity government the following April. It broke down three months later, and fighting has continued.
The conflict has resulted in the deaths of tens of thousands of people and left more than half of the country's 12 million population in need of humanitarian aid, according to the UN.
The UN declared a famine in two districts in February of last year, but said that crisis had started to ease in June.

To get here, cars spill out from a major motorway onto a country road and wind down to a security gate on the edge of a sloping field.
Inside the wire-rimmed perimeter, rows of prefabricated trailers line rubbish-strewn pathways.
These container-like structures, whose sides are covered in graffiti and children's drawings, house about 300 people, most of whom are from the Middle East and Africa.
Moments before the gate of the Kofinou reception centre for asylum seekers opens, a fistfight breaks out just metres away.
The quarrel is brief, but tension hangs in the air long after it ends.
The instigator ""has psychological problems"", bystanders say, and has apparently caused trouble before. As for the victim? He shares a tiny room with him.
The state-run Kofinou centre opened in 2004 to host a maximum of 120 people. A decade later, in 2014, the authorities increased its capacity and today the camp can be home to as many as 400 people.
Refugees and asylum seekers reside here as they wait for a decision to be made on their asylum claims. But without a specific time limit on their stay, many end up living in the centre for several months, or even years.
Living conditions are grim.
At the far end of the isolated centre, past idling men and boisterous children, a stream of raw sewage trickles down the sun-beaten cement.
The overflow is constant, ending in a pond of stagnant water, and the air is heavy with the stench of uncollected rubbish.
While most of the residents avoid this area, Bassam, a 41-year-old ship mechanic from the Syrian coastal city of Tartus, has no choice - the unit housing his six-member family is just a few steps away.
""I took my children twice to the doctor because of this [sewage],"" he says, indignantly, through a translator one morning in February, as he gives his shy seven-year-old son a haircut.
""Every day, it gets worse and worse,"" he adds, making a few final deft jabs with a bright red comb and black clippers.
""The other day, my boy here told me, 'we're not allowed to go out any more ... it feels like being in prison'.""
The sewage problem has been going on for years.
Standing nearby, Makis Polydorou, head of Cyprus's asylum service, which is responsible for the centre's overall management, says a sewerage truck comes by regularly to clean the area.
However, he admits this is not a lasting solution. ""Unfortunately, the problem remains,"" he says, adding that authorities are working for a permanent fix, without offering a timeframe.
""We cannot hide; a mistake was done here.""
Ever since its 2014 expansion, the centre has been full or close to its maximum capacity. Yet, the dramatic spike in the number of residents has not been followed by an increase in staff.
As a result, residents complain of serious health and safety risks due to inadequate cleaning services, while delays in the maintenance of facilities, including problems with air-conditioning and heating systems, only exacerbate the worsening living conditions.
""These [units] are ovens in the summer and freezer boxes in the winter,"" says Anastacia Wieclawska Kyriakou, mother and baby volunteer co-ordinator for Kofinou We Care, a group which supports the asylum seekers.
""There are toilets that do not work in homes and mothers with young children have to walk for 100 metres in the middle of the night to take children as young as two to the toilet,"" she adds.
""I defy anybody to stay in this camp for 48 hours.""
The remoteness of the centre adds to its residents' predicament.
""There's nothing to do. We wake up, we eat something and we sleep again - nothing else,"" says Bassam. ""We don't have a real life.""
Unsurprisingly, anger often boils over, fuelled by long-standing grievances over poor living conditions, delays in processing their asylum claims and a lack of future prospects. Last week, some residents set rubbish bins on fire and caused extensive damage to a number of facilities.
From 2002 to mid-2017, only two percent of asylum applications (2,351) were approved for refugee status in Cyprus, which allows asylum seekers to live and work legally, according to UN refugee agency data.
About 15 percent (6,887) of applicants were given subsidiary protection, a status below that of refugee. The rest of the applications - 83 percent (44,376) - were either rejected or otherwise closed.
While many European Union countries do not differentiate between the two tiers of protection, the Cypriot government four years ago introduced changes which took away family reunification rights from people with subsidiary protection.
The amended laws also did not protect them from expulsion prevention and did not give them immediate access to valid travel documents.
Human rights advocates say the changes were politically motivated and aimed at preventing people from attempting to reach Cyprus's shores at the height of the refugee crisis.
""The logic of the policy that was followed was 'it's better not to come to Cyprus, go to another country',"" says Doros Polykarpou, executive director of KISA, a Nicosia-based NGO.
The government's official line, he argues, is ""'we do the minimum that is required of us according to our [EU] obligations, but we don't want to encourage them [asylum seekers] and let them think that they can visit our paradise'"".
Polydorou, the head of the asylum service, rejected the allegations Cyprus was working to keep asylum seekers out through strict policies, and defended the agency's decision-making record on asylum requests.
""It's not a matter of percentages,"" he says. ""There are criteria, and each individual case is examined on its own merit.""
At the start of last year, nearly 3,100 asylum seekers had pending applications in Cyprus.
A vast majority of the applicants lived independently, while 112 were unaccompanied children hosted in special reception centres and 307 lived at the Kofinou centre.
In Kofinou, families are typically placed in units with two rooms - one for each family - and a shared bathroom.
In some cases, large families are given both rooms, but in others, family members can be forced to sleep on mattresses on the cramped floor of their single room.
Meanwhile, between two and four single persons - often all strangers to one another - must share a small room and use a communal bathroom outside their containers.
Those communal bathrooms are overrun with problems. A layer of mould coats the surface behind several of the showers, basin faucets are frequently broken, and doors are unhinged. In one of the cubicles, a toilet bowl lies upside down, ripped from the ground.
Hot water is a rarity, residents also say.
Nearby, in one of the shared kitchens, the situation is equally bad. The floor is covered in a shallow pool of liquid, fed by the constant leaking of ruptured water pipes. Black mould is visible here too, spreading in and around the hobs, many of which are not working.
""How can anyone cook anything here?"" Edi, a fifty-something Albanian resident, asks furiously. ""Everything is rotten.""
Mohammed, 46, used to be a chef in the Syrian city of Deraa, but he doesn't spend much time in the shared kitchen.
Sitting inside the poorly-lit trailer that has housed his family for the past 15 months, he jumps off a stool and flips open his phone.
An amorphous mass of brown-hued rubble lights up the small screen. These ruins used to be his house, he says.
The flattening of their two-storey home by heavy shelling in June 2015, on the third day of Ramadan, left Mohammed, his wife and their three young children with no option but to flee Syria’s long-running war - first to Turkey and then Cyprus.
Today, inside the confines of the Kofinou centre, Mohammed - tired-looking but greeting visitors with a gentle smile - appears roundly out of place.
Speaking through a translator, he says all he wants is to start a new life outside the centre, which he says is home to ""a lot of"" drug use, making him fear for the wellbeing of his children.
Across the packed room, his wife agrees.
""What's important to us is the future of our children, their safety and privacy,"" she says, holding the couple's 10-day-old fourth child on her lap.
""Our dream is to find a place [outside] and get out of here.""
Yet, moving out and integrating into Cypriot society, as well as planting new roots on the island, is not easy.
Like almost all Syrians seeking asylum on Cyprus, Mohammed was not granted refugee status but subsidiary protection.
This was three months ago and since then, he says he has been searching in vain for a house in Nicosia. ""We are a family, we are supposed to get 280 euro [$345] a month for the house but the house is 400-500 euro [$490-$615] a month,"" says Mohammed.
""The houses are either so expensive or the ones with affordable rent, landlords don’t agree to rent to Arabs or [asylum seekers],” he continues. ""And this is happening with everybody, not just with me.""
Mohammed says he had similar experiences while searching for a job in restaurants, as well as dealing with state officials.
""I've tried a few times to find work but sometimes they say to me they don't [want to hire me] because I’m an Arab, and other times because of the language, and the age,"" he says.
""If you mention the word that you are a refugee, they will not rent to you,"" says Kyriakou, from Kofinou We Care.
""Institutional racism is also a problem, and I don’t know why because we are a refugee nation,"" she adds, referring to the uprooting of hundreds of thousands of Cypriots following the island's division in 1974.
Polykarpou, of KISA, says there are three reasons for what he calls ""harsh"" attitudes towards asylum seekers.
""The Cypriot society is self-centred and phobic,"" he says.
The long-standing Cyprus issue has defined collective thinking to the point that ""we worry too much about the alteration of our demographic situation and this stems from history, the experiences, the country’s psyche and the problem that exists"".
He also says that the populist, xenophobic far-right, feeding off the despair of a crippling financial crisis and a backlash against foreigners, gained ground on Cyprus in recent years, just as stricter policies towards refugees became the norm across Europe.
""Let's not fool ourselves, Europe is finding it difficult to assume its responsibilities in regards to the refugee crisis and each country is trying to 'push' refugees to a neighbouring country.""
Caught in all this, Mohammed says he is still not ready to give up, despite his hardship.
""I'm scared about the future, but I'm not yet hopeless,"" he says from inside his trailer.
""If you became hopeless, that means you will lose everything, and we have to be strong to be able to raise our children. But inside, we are hurting, we are in pain"".

Turkey - together with the Syrian opposition Free Syrian Army (FSA) rebel group - last month launched an air-and-ground operation into Afrin in the northwest of Syria to vanquish the US-backed Kurdish People's Protection Units (YPG) fighters near its border.
Turkey hosts the vast majority of refugees who fled the war in Syria with 3.4 million displaced within its borders, according to the Turkish government. About 5.6 million Syrians have left the war-torn country since March 2011.
""Turkey will try to enhance the infrastructure and resources in Afrin after it is secured for them to return,"" said Yasin Aktay, a chief adviser to Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
Turkey considers the Kurdish Democratic Union Party (PYD) in Syria and its armed wing YPG to be ""terrorist groups"" with ties to the banned Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK).
The PKK has waged a decades-long armed fight against the Turkish state that has killed tens of thousands of people.
Aktay, also a senior member of parliament, said he expects tens of thousands of refugees to return to Afrin once the military operation is over.
""We know that many Syrian refugees in Turkey want to return home if a secure environment is established in their region of origin. However, others prefer to stay in Turkey until the whole country is secured,"" Aktay told Al Jazeera.
Another official familiar with the issue, who asked to remain anonymous, said there are refugees in Turkey who left Afrin because of the Kurdish militia and they, in particular, would be the focus of any return.
""There are Kurdish refugees who escaped the group there,"" the official said.
""We cannot give any expected numbers as all returns are going to be voluntary. We are in no position to force them to return to their home country.""
He noted 140,000 Syrian refugees returned home after Turkey's previous cross-border operation - dubbed Euphrates Shield - that ended in March 2017 after seven months.
During that offensive, Turkey and the FSA captured the border town of Jarablus by the Euphrates River, removed Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL, also known as ISIS) fighters from the 100-km stretch of border, and advanced to the southern city of al-Bab, which was also under ISIL control.
The FSA, supported by Turkish troops, are still in control of the 200,000-square metre area.

US President Donald Trump, Russian leader Vladimir Putin, and China's President Xi Jinping were among a number of politicians who rolled out regressive policies in 2017, according to Amnesty International's annual human rights report published on Thursday.
The human rights body also mentioned the leaders of Egypt, the Philippines and Venezuela.
""The spectres of hatred and fear now loom large in world affairs, and we have few governments standing up for human rights in these disturbing times,"" Salil Shetty, Amnesty's secretary-general, said.
""Instead, leaders such as el-Sisi, Duterte, Maduro, Putin, Trump and Xi are callously undermining the rights of millions.""
Amnesty's The State of the World's Human Rights report cites Trump's controversial travel ban prohibiting entrants to the US from six Muslim-majority countries, Venezuelan authorities' use of force against demonstrators and unlawful killings in the Philippines' anti-drug war as evidence of policies resulting in an international regression on human rights.
More than 20,000 people have been killed since June 2016 in Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte's anti-drug campaign, according to an internal report.
Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein, the UN's human rights chief, has denounced Venezuela's excessive use of force against anti-government protesters, stating pro-government security forces and armed groups were responsible for dozens of demonstrator deaths between April and July last year.
The regressive approach to human rights adopted by a number of world leaders has, however, inspired new waves of social activism and protest, Amnesty said, highlighting the example of the Women's March in January last year, which began in the US before becoming a global protest.
Margaret Huang, Amnesty's executive director in the US, said the movement had showcased the power of public protest.
""Defenders of human rights around the world can look to the people of the United States to stand with them, even where the US government has failed,"" Huang said.
""Activists from across the country remind us that the fight for universal human rights has always been waged and won by people in their communities.""
The Women's March movement saw rallies take place in several US cities, and more than 600 locations worldwide, during January 2017 in protest over perceived anti-women comments made by Trump during his successful presidential election campaign.
Trump is setting a ""dangerous precedent"" on human rights, Amnesty warned as it released the report at a press conference in Washington, DC, citing the president's discrimination of transgender individuals, verbal attacks on the media, and anti-immigration rhetoric.
It is the first time Amnesty has published its annual human rights assessment - started in 1961 - in the US.
Leslie Vinjamuri, an associate fellow with the US and the Americas Programme at the UK-based Chatham House Institute of International Affairs, told Al Jazeera Trump has rejected ""core principles of human rights"".
""From his effort during his first weeks in office to implement a Muslim [travel] ban, to his initial response to the violence in Charlottesville, the president's words have been racist and discriminatory,"" Vinjamuri said.
""Words matter, they send a clear signal that enables certain kinds of activity and inhibits others.""
The number of hate groups in the US grew by more than four percent last year, according to US-based civil rights watchdog the Southern Poverty Law Center, marking a 20 percent rise since 2014.
The US Department of State told Al Jazeera it welcomes ""constructive scrutiny"" of the US' human rights record by NGOs and other governments.
""We do not ask of others what we would not demand of ourselves. We are mindful of, and take seriously, advice from domestic and international civil society about how we can improve,"" a State Department official said anonymously.
""Promoting, protecting, and advancing human rights has long been and remains the policy of the United States.""
Amnesty's report - covering 159 countries - arrives amid a number of ongoing humanitarian crises worldwide.
In Yemen, more than 22 million people - about 75 percent of the population - are in need of humanitarian assistance following almost three years of civil war, according to the UN.
Fighting between a Saudi Arabia-led coalition and Iranian-backed Houthi rebels has killed more than 10,000 people since the conflict broke out in March 2015.
The Saudi-led coalition has undertaken a major campaign of aerial bombardment against the Houthis in Yemen, aimed at restoring the government of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi.
Elsewhere, in Myanmar, a government crackdown against the country's mostly Muslim minority Rohingya population led to more than 655,000 refugees fleeing into neighbouring Bangladesh in the final five months of 2017, according to the UN.
The number of refugees has since risen to nearly 690,000 in recent weeks, the UN has said, making it the fastest-growing refugee crisis in the world.
Myanmar's history of discrimination and segregation of the Rohingya were early ""warning signs"" of the ongoing crisis, Amnesty's report said, which was sparked by Rohingya ARSA fighters attacking more than 30 police sites in the country's western Rakhine State during August 2017.
The UN has said the crisis may amount to genocide.
""This episode will stand in history as yet another testament to the world's catastrophic failure to address conditions that provide fertile ground for mass atrocity crimes,"" Shetty said.
""The transformation of discrimination and demonisation into mass violence is tragically familiar, and its ruinous consequences cannot be easily undone,"" he added.
""The feeble response to crimes against humanity and war crimes from Myanmar to Iraq, South Sudan, Syria and Yemen underscored the lack of leadership on human rights. Governments are shamelessly turning the clock back on decades of hard-won protections.""

Aid organisations are ""stepping up the efforts"" to prevent the contagious disease from spreading as refugees fleeing inter-ethnic violence in Ituri province continue to arrive in the Kyangwali settlement, UNHCR spokeswoman Duniya Aslam Khan said on Thursday.
Nearly 43,000 refugees have arrived in Uganda from Congo since the beginning of the year.
More than 27,000 crossed Lake Albert from northeastern Ituri, fleeing clashes between Hema herders and Lendu farmers.
Another 15,435 refugees arrived in Uganda from North Kivu, running from armed groups and military offensives.

""The number of new arrivals has declined,"" Khan said on Thursday.
""Initially we were facing problems of overcrowding because we had to transport all those who were arriving. Even now we still have about 4,000 people waiting to be transported"" from a reception centre at the Kyangwali settlement.
A decades-old conflict between the Hema and Lendu killed tens of thousands between 1998 and 2003. In recent years, the two groups have maintained a low-level conflict with occasional flare-ups in violence.
Last year, conflict forced 1.7 million people across Congo to flee their homes.

The asylum seekers are the first to be placed in indefinite detention since the Israeli government announced it would force tens of thousands of African migrants to choose between deportation to a third country or incarceration for an unspecified length of time.
""This is the first step in a what is a globally unprecedented deportation operation, a move tainted by racism and complete disregard for the life and dignity of asylum seekers,"" the Hotline for Refugees and Migrants and ASSAF, two Tel Aviv-based refugee rights groups, said in a statement on Wednesday.
Two of the seven asylum seekers detained at the Saharonim prison in southern Israel on Tuesday are survivors of torture, the organisations said.
Meanwhile, hundreds of asylum seekers began a hunger strike late Tuesday in the Holot detention centre to protest the imprisonment of the seven Eritreans, Israeli media reported.
There are about 27,000 Eritrean and 7,700 Sudanese asylum seekers in Israel, the UN refugee agency (UNHCR) said.
In November last year, the Israeli government announced plans to deport the remaining asylum seekers, without their consent.
Israel has issued deportation notices to about 600 people to date, the human rights groups said.
The third countries expected to take in the deportees are widely thought to be Rwanda and Uganda, Israeli media have reported, though both African countries have denied making formal deals with the Israeli government.
""It is mind boggling that Uganda and Rwanda agree to take part in this deportation plan and enable Israel to treat African asylum seekers - some of them fleeing from genocide and dictatorship - in this manner,"" the rights groups said.
In January, the UNHCR urged Israel to reconsider its deportation plan. It said at least 80 asylum seekers deported by Israel between 2015 and 2017 ""risked their lives by taking dangerous onward journeys to Europe"".
Along the way, ""they suffered abuse, torture and extortion before risking their lives once again by crossing the Mediterranean to Italy"", said William Spindler, a UNHCR spokesman.

A spokesperson for the UN's refugee agency (UNHCR) said on Monday that entrenched intercommunal conflict between several ethnic groups in Tanganyika province was ""triggering spiraling displacement and human rights abuses"".
""Moreover, fierce clashes between the Congolese armed forces and militias have continued since the end of January, while new armed groups threaten to wreak more havoc in the province,"" Andrej Mahecic said in a statement.
The surge in violence in Tanganyika - an area that is home to about three million people - was largely between the Twa, Luba and other ethnic groups.
It comes amid more than 800 reported human rights abuses in the province over the first two weeks of February alone.
""People fleeing for their lives near the provincial capital Kalemie share stories of horrific violence during attacks against their villages, including killings, abductions and rape,"" Mahecic said.
Increasing conflict and a dire humanitarian situation in the DRC forced 1.7 million people to flee their homes last year alone.
Also this week, two humanitarian aid workers were killed.
Throughout 2017, more than 12,000 reports of human rights violations in Tanganyika and the nearby area of Haut Katanga were documented, the UN also said.
The number of people who fled their homes in Tanganyika nearly doubled between 2016 and 2017, rising from 370,000 in December 2016 to 630,000 at the end of last year, according to the latest figures.
A UNHCR spokesperson told Al Jazeera the violence is ""one of the most severe and one of the most worrying"" localised conflicts in the DRC.
""It's a crisis which has been gradually increasing with growing hatred between ethnic groups,"" Andreas Kirchhof said.
Ethnic violence between the Bantu and Twa ethnic groups has intensified since mid-2016.
The International Rescue Committee said more than 400 villages were destroyed between July 2016 and March 2017 as a result of the conflict.
As of last October, UNHCR reported the DRC was home to 3.9 million internally displaced persons, while more than 600,000 Congolese refugees had sought refuge in more than 11 other African countries.

More than 22,000 people fled clashes between Hema herders and Lendu farmers in Ituri province last week, according to the UN's refugee agency (UNHCR).
This marked a dramatic increase in the number of people crossing Lake Albert to reach Uganda in search of safety, bringing the overall figure since the start of the year to 34,000.
The latest influx follows what a UNHCR spokesperson called ""the latest and biggest wave"" in an outbreak of violence that started in the area in December.
""A number of local monitors have confirmed to us that more than 1,000 houses have been burned in Djugu, Ituri territory, which is the epicentre of the violence. The displaced say that groups of armed men set houses on fire and killed civilians,"" Andreas Kirchhof told Al Jazeera on Wednesday.
""It's a very worrying situation. There is fear the violence may spread further.""
UNHCR staff reported that several villages along Lake Albert had been entirely deserted.
A further 15,000 internally displaced persons arrived in Bunia, capital of Congo's Ituri province, in the past 10 days, a spokesperson for the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs told Al Jazeera.
Yvon Edoumou said there were reports of several dozen deaths in Djugu, as well as homes being burned down.
The violence is thought to be the latest escalation in the ongoing conflict between the Hema herders and the Lendu farmers.
Due to a lack of access to the territory, it is difficult to verify who is perpetrating the violence and what caused the surge.
""What we can say is that the displaced people have been attacked by armed men, people they didn't know,” Kirchhof told Al Jazeera.
The governor of Ituri, Jefferson Abdallah Penembaka, told Reuters news agency that the Hema-Lendu conflict killed at least 30 people over two days in early February.
International aid group CARE also expressed concern over the refugee influx from Congo to Uganda, saying that the majority of fleeing women had experienced or witnessed gender-based violence on their way to Uganda.
In a statement on Wednesday, the organisation said the majority of refugees are women and children and that most of them are ""heavily traumatised"".
""People arrive exhausted, dehydrated, hungry and emotionally devastated. They are running for their lives,"" Delphine Pinault, CARE's country director for Uganda, said in the statement.
""We've heard stories of people waiting to cross from the other side who are spending the night in the lake for fear of being attacked.""
The UNHCR warned that more people might lose their lives while making the dangerous lake crossing.
Four Congolese refugees are feared to have drowned after their boat capsized while crossing to Uganda on February 11.
Ethnic strife between the Hema and Lendu dates back to the 1970s. The communities were embroiled in a violent armed conflict between 1998 and 2003, in which tens of thousands were killed. In recent years, the two groups have maintained a low-level conflict with occasional flare-ups in violence.
Last year, conflict forced 1.7 million people across Congo to flee their homes.
In October 2017, the UNHCR said there were 3.9 million internally displaced persons in the country, and more than 600,000 refugees from Congo spread over 11 African countries.

The accident also left at least 124 people injured, 35 of whom needed to be urgently transported to hospitals in the Libyan capital, Tripoli, according to the Libya Observer.
Bani Walid is located 180km southeast of Tripoli.
The truck was carrying an estimated 300 people, according to local reports.

In recent years, Libya has become a major transit point for refugees and migrants undertaking the dangerous journey to reach Europe via the Mediterranean Sea.
According to the United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR), up to 90 percent of people crossing the Mediterranean towards Europe depart from Libya.
The International Organization for Migration (IOM) estimates that up to one million individuals fleeing their homes are currently residing in Libya.
Last year, nearly 120,000 people arrived in European Union countries, having travelled through the Mediterranean from North Africa, according to IOM.
More than 20,000 people are estimated to have died attempting the crossing to Italy in the past four years, the IOM estimates, making Europe's Mediterranean border the deadliest in the world.
Around 90 refugees drowned after a shipwreck off Libya's western coast on February 2, two weeks after the Italian coastguard rescued some 1,400 refugees from overcrowded boats in the Mediterranean.

It was the beginning of the six-year-long First Intifada.
After two decades of illegal Israeli occupation in the Gaza Strip and West Bank, Palestinians of all generations and political parties worked together in astounding unity as one force, demanding Palestine's liberation.
With their non-violent tactics, such as protests, general strikes, and a boycott of Israeli products, the First Intifada became a model for grassroots resistance.
""We were expecting that this intifada would bring a state for us Palestinians. [The movement] was that strong. It's not like these days,"" said Naila Ayyash, who was in her mid-20s when the intifada broke out.
""At that time, political parties were very strong, especially the women's movement inside the parties.""
According to Rula Salameh, who was a freshman at Ramallah's Birzeit University when the intifada began, there wasn't a single student who hadn't joined a political party on campus. All students spent their time and energy helping their community and working towards the collective mission of liberating Palestine from Israeli occupation.
Salameh recalled sleeping in tents for three nights in a village near Tulkarm with 150 university students; the student council arranged the trip so they could help a Palestinian family collect olives on their land.
Since an Israeli military area and a settlement were located near their land, soldiers would typically prevent the family from reaching their lands during olive harvest season, Salameh explained.
""This was the first time that [the family] managed to collect all the olives without being attacked by soldiers,"" Salameh said.
""Compared with the situation today, it's totally different. Voluntary work was really a part of our life, part of what we were educated to do. Everyone felt that they were doing something positive for their community. We weren't wasting our energy.""
While the student movement served as an engine that helped propel the First Intifada, today's youth face drastically different dynamics.
Following US President Donald Trump's recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital in early December, both Fatah and Hamas called for a new intifada, but only some 3,000 protesters showed up, compared with tens of thousands of Palestinians on the streets during the First Intifada.
Omar Kiswani, president of the student council at Birzeit University, told Al Jazeera the Palestinian Authority (PA) is the biggest obstacle for politically active youth today; students are regularly arrested and imprisoned for their political affiliations on campus.
The PA, formed under the 1993 Oslo accords that officially ended the intifada, has long been criticised as an obstacle to Palestinian resistance because of its security collaboration, as a quisling authority, with Israel.
Kiswani was arrested as he prepared his candidacy in student elections. He spent a year in Israeli prisons for his participation in a Hamas-affiliated group on campus.
""They say that our work is illegal,"" Kiswani said. ""We get arrested regularly. Students from all parties get arrested, but Hamas students are arrested more. We're getting used to it.""
In the past year, two presidents of the student union were arrested, as well as other members, said Kiswani.
Birzeit student Yahya Rabee, 21, was arrested at 2am by PA forces who raided his home. They detained him for three days before handing him over to Israeli forces. He was imprisoned in Israel for eight months, enduring physical abuse.
In his jail cell, he found seven friends from Birzeit also imprisoned for being part of the Hamas-affiliated group. All the young members of his family have been imprisoned for the same reason.
According to Birzeit's Right to Education campaign, since Trump's Jerusalem declaration, there has been an increase in student arrests. Currently, there are more than 60 Birzeit students imprisoned in Israeli jails, detentions that are illegal under international law.
Since 2004, more than 800 Birzeit students have been arrested. Some have been sentenced to more than one life sentence.
""Israel tries to destroy [the youth] by arresting them, imprisoning them and by attacking, especially, the student council,"" said Sondos Hamad, coordinator of the Right to Education campaign.
""The Israeli occupation feels threatened by student leaders, by members of the student council, by those who are our hope to change the status quo.""
About 40 percent of Palestine's male population has been imprisoned by Israel since 1967.
Any Palestinian who has shown strong potential as a leader has either been imprisoned or assassinated.
""We believe and hope that every Palestinian in prison will be freed,"" Rabee said. ""They're the ones who are able to lead Palestinians, not the PA. Some of them are doctors, professors; they have [the capacity] to lead.""
Rabee and Ayyash both pointed out the Palestinians' financial dependency on the PA as a factor for some to avoid civil disobedience.
""Some people just care about their money and how they live. They're afraid of the PA and of being imprisoned,"" Rabee said.
The Palestinian Authority employs about 30 percent of the workforce in the occupied territories. An end to the PA could impoverish about one million Palestinians.
For Ayyash, the Oslo Accords were extremely detrimental for the Palestinian cause.
""After Oslo, everything changed,"" Ayyash said. ""It brought us disconnected cities, settlements are more than before, the wall is everywhere.
""After Oslo, hope continued, but many points in Oslo weren't in our interest, especially when they divided the land into Areas A, B and C. This is very bad. This is Palestinian land. Why divide it like this?""
Division and isolation is what Palestinians living in the besieged Gaza Strip have been struggling with for the past decade.
Besieged by Israel and Egypt, the UN has repeatedly warned of a humanitarian crisis unfolding.
Al-Azhar University student Randa Harara, 21, often attends non-violent demonstrations, and said they do make a difference in letting the world know about the suffering in Gaza.
Last December, an Israeli sniper shot her in the thigh while she was protesting near Gaza's eastern border. Harara had just finished giving a TV interview when she was shot, standing 300 metres away from the fence. Despite her painful injury, she is adamant about rejoining the demonstrations as soon as she recovers.
""This is our duty towards Jerusalem. As a Palestinian from Gaza, this is the least that I can do for my nation to fight against [oppression] … As long as we're besieged, it's normal that we keep protesting against it.""
However, because of Gaza's isolation, it's difficult for protests to pick up momentum, as was the case with the First Intifada. For a population of two million, the number of people who join the demonstrations every Friday is low, Harara explained.
""There's a distance between us and Jerusalem. If we [weren't under siege], we could do more.
""There has to be a better way to organise the movement. We have to express our anger and frustration in any way that we can, because it's a big issue. There should be more people going to the streets, attending demonstrations. It's for the Palestinian cause. If we, the youth, don't move, then who will?""
Ayyash said during the First Intifada the majority of demonstrators were women. However, today, in Gaza, it is rare to see women participating in protests.
Many told Harara that, as a woman, it's better for her to stay at home or to focus on her education.
""I believe in what I'm doing. What people say about me is meaningless, as I'm sure I'm not doing anything wrong,"" Harara said.
""I think that if other women weren't facing social stigmatisation, which prevents them from attending demonstrations, there would be many more people willing to express their frustrations through demonstrations.""
Ayyash and Salameh agree the role of Palestinian political parties has diminished since the Oslo Accords.
The new generation has the energy and willpower, but no one is guiding them in the right direction, Salameh said.
""This is what I hear all the time [from the youth]: 'We don't know what to do,'"" explained Salameh.
""[Political parties] aren't interested in working with the young generation and explaining to them the power that they have and how they should use it … We're not giving them a chance to replace [the old generation.]""
The key to success is unity, said Ayyash. The split between Fatah and Hamas has continued for 11 years and without unity, no goal can be achieved.
""Before, we were united [during the First Intifada],"" Ayyash said. ""There is a gap between the [political] leaders and the people, and Israel is playing with it.""

Sam Sokha was forcibly returned to Cambodia on Thursday after a Thai court found her guilty of overstaying her visa, according to Amnesty International.
She fled to Thailand last year, where she was given refugee status by the UN refugee agency (UNHCR), after Cambodian police launched an investigation into the video clip that was posted on Facebook.
""This person, when will he stop destroying the nation?"" she is heard saying in the video, referring to Hun Sen, who has been in power for more than 30 years.
Cambodian prosecutors later pressed charges of ""insulting a public official"" and ""incitement to discriminate"" against her and issued a warrant.
On Friday, the Phnom Penh Post, citing pro-government Fresh News, said a court in the southern Kampong Speu province convicted Sokha in absentia last month and sentenced her to two years in jail.
Upon her arrival from Thailand, she was apprehended by Cambodian police and transferred to a prison in Kampong Speu, Olof Blomqvist, a spokesman for Amnesty, told Al Jazeera on Saturday.
""These charges are completely baseless and only related to her peaceful activism,"" said Blomqvist.
""It is staggering that someone can face prison time for nothing but throwing a shoe at a poster.""
Sokha's deportation violated the customary principle of international law that prohibits the return of anyone to a place where they could be persecuted, tortured or face other human rights violations, he added.
Thailand, which hosts more than 100,000 refugees, is not party to the international convention on refugees and treats any refugee living outside of designated camps on the Thai border with Myanmar as an undocumented immigrant.
The move against Sokha comes amid a sweeping crackdown on dissent in Cambodia.
Authorities in Cambodia have arrested opposition leader Kem Sokha on charges of ""treason and espionage"" and shuttered several media outlets seen as critical of the government.
The clampdown has forced several opposition members of parliament into exile, with many seeking refuge in Thailand.
Brad Adams, Asia director for Human Rights Watch, on Friday said Thai authorities had deported Sokha despite knowing that Western embassies and the UNHCR were trying to resettle her in a third country.
""Thailand's friends should formally and publicly complain about this shocking act of sending a refugee back to a country where she will face near-certain persecution,"" Adams said in a statement.
""This case sets a worrisome precedent for how Thailand will treat the many other refugees currently on its soil.""
Adams also urged the UN to press Cambodia to release Sam Sokha and allow her to travel to a safe country.
Thailand, in recent years, has forcibly returned more than 100 refugees and asylum seekers based on the requests of foreign governments.

So when Israeli officials offered him a third option - a one-way flight to Uganda and $3,500 cash - he begrudgingly agreed to leave.
Awdalla was given a travel document and boarded a plane in Tel Aviv. Exhausted by what he had already been through, he fell asleep.
But when he woke up, he was in Sudan's capital, Khartoum.
""I thought it was a dream, but it was a reality,"" Awdalla told Al Jazeera.
His account of a ""voluntary"" departure from Israel gone wrong comes amid a growing protest movement against an Israeli government plan to forcibly expel tens of thousands of African asylum seekers.
On Wednesday, thousands of aslyum seekers protested in front of the Rwandan embassy in Tel Aviv, chanting, ""Deportation kills"" and ""We are not criminals, we are refugees"", AP news agency reported.
Rallies were also expected in London, New York, Paris, Berlin, Toronto and more than a dozen other cities to protest Israel's effort to deport asylum seekers to third countries in Africa, namely Rwanda and Uganda.
If they do not agree to leave, the asylum seekers may be imprisoned indefinitely in Israel.
The protests are being held outside the Rwandan embassies in each respective city throughout the day.
""Protesters will demand that Rwandan President and African Union chairman Paul Kagame refuse to participate in Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's plan,"" organisers said in a statement.
Originally from the Sudanese region of Darfur, Awdalla, now 29, had been living in Israel for nearly five years when he took his deportation flight in 2014.
He said he believes the Israelis lied to him about where the plane was going and never intended to send him to Uganda in the first place. ""They didn't tell the truth,"" he claimed.
Once in Sudan, he said he feared he would be jailed and tortured - or worse. ""I knew that I was in Sudan so I was thinking, how am I going to survive?""
Travelling to Israel is expressly forbidden for Sudanese nationals. Sudan does not recognise Israel and does not maintain diplomatic ties to Tel Aviv.
If a Sudanese citizen comes back after being in Israel, he or she will be interrogated by the Sudanese authorities. If records of their stay in Israel exist, then they may be held in temporary detention until they are proven not to be ""anti-state"" agents.
Though exact numbers do not exist, Awdalla is believed to be among about 4,000 African asylum seekers who, faced with the prospect of imprisonment, have signed deals with the Israeli government since 2013 to be deported to third countries in Africa, according to the United Nations.
Those third countries are widely thought to be Rwanda and Uganda, Israeli media have reported.
About 27,000 Eritrean and 7,700 Sudanese asylum seekers currently live in Israel, figures from the UN refugee agency (UNHCR) show.
This week, the Israeli government issued deportation notices to 20,000 male asylum seekers, Reuters news agency reported, giving them 60 days to leave the country or face indefinite detention.
The asylum seekers will be able to go to Rwanda or back to their home countries, Haaretz newspaper said.
In testimony collected by an Israeli human rights group, an Eritrean asylum seeker named Dawit said Israeli officials pressured him to sign a so-called voluntary repatriation document that stated, ""I want to go to Rwanda"".
""I said I did not want to write that, I am leaving only because I cannot stay. They told me: ‘You have to,'"" he said.

For his part, Awdalla had lived in Libya and Egypt before crossing into Israel through the Sinai desert in 2009. He was jailed when he first arrived, but let out after eight months on a ""conditional release"" visa.
Israel does not verify individual refugee claims. Instead, it grants asylum seekers temporary protection, which allows them to remain in the country, but does not give them access to healthcare and other social services, as well as the legal right to work.
Israeli government officials have in the last years described African asylum seekers as ""infiltrators"", ""a cancer"", and as a threat to the state's Jewish majority.
Since 2009, Israel has only recognised 10 Eritreans and one Sudanese national as refugees, according to UNHCR.
The agency recently said it had identified 80 cases of Eritrean refugees and asylum seekers who were ""relocated from Israel"" and later ""risked their lives by taking dangerous onward journeys to Europe via Libya"".
African migrants have been abused and sold as slaves in Libya, which serves as a main transit point on many routes to Europe.
Some of the asylum seekers who had been deported from Israel said ""that people travelling with them had died en route to Libya, where many experienced extortion and detention, as well as being subjected to abuse - including torture - and violence"", said William Spindler, UNHCR spokesperson.
""UNHCR is again appealing to Israel to halt its policy of relocating Eritreans and Sudanese to sub-Saharan Africa,"" Spindler said in a statement.
Despite this, Israel announced late last year that it intends to give the remaining asylum seekers two options: indefinite detention in an Israeli prison, or deportation to a third country, even without their consent.
To that end, the Israeli cabinet recently approved a proposal to close the Holot detention facility by March. Holot was built specifically to hold African asylum seekers in southern Israel.
""This removal is enabled thanks to an international agreement I achieved, which allows us to remove the 40,000 remaining infiltrators without their consent,"" Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel's prime minister, has said.
After the plan was made public, Rwanda's foreign minister told a local newspaper the country was in negotiations with Israel to take in as many as 10,000 asylum seekers.
But both Rwanda and Uganda subsequently denied reports they had formal agreements with Israel to take in any asylum seekers.
""Let me be clear: Rwanda will NEVER receive any African migrant who is deported against his/her will,"" Olivier Nduhungirehe, the country's minister of state in the ministry of foreign affairs, wrote on Twitter on January 24.
Let me be clear: Rwanda will NEVER receive any African migrant who is deported against his/her will. Our « open doors » policy only applies to those who come to Rwanda voluntary, without any form of constraint. Any manipulation of women, men & children in distress is appalling. https://t.co/W1chMCq96y
Okello Oryem, Uganda's foreign minister, also denied the existence of any ""written agreement or any form of agreement between the government of Uganda and the Israeli government to accept refugees from Israel"".
However, Sigal Rozen, of the Tel Aviv-based Hotline for Refugees and Migrants, told Al Jazeera that the Israeli government has made ""all sorts of obscure deals"" to get rid of asylum seekers.
""We don't know the details ... we don't know the safeguards of the deals,"" she said, however, explaining that the secrecy with which Israel carries out its policy makes the deportations dangerous.
""In these cases, a mistake might cost the life of a person. These are not little errors.""
For years, Israel also sought to pass ""decrees and laws whose main purpose is to make their life miserable until they leave"", added Rozen.
When the government realised people would not go back to their home countries voluntarily, it sought to find third countries that would be willing to take them in ""for the right amount of money and who knows what else"", she said.
She said the third countries are not truly absorbing the asylum seekers, but bringing them in ""without providing them [with] any legal status"".
In testimonies collected over the past four years, asylum seekers described being sent from Israel to Rwanda, where they said they were handed over to people-smugglers who told them ""they cannot stay in Rwanda and they must go to Uganda"", Rozen said.
An asylum seeker who agreed to leave Israel for Rwanda in 2015 recently told Israeli researchers he was coerced to leave for Uganda in this way.
""Three days after our arrival, this man picked us up from the airport told us, 'You must leave for Uganda'. I asked where are our documents and why must we leave? - He said that we must,"" the asylum seeker said, according to the report.
""It is as if Israel thinks that the fact that the Eritrean and Sudanese [refugees] share a similar skin colour with the Rwandan and Ugandan people, [and that] is a good enough reason to send them there,"" Rozen said.
In the past year, Netanyahu has made a noticeable push to strengthen Israel's ties to African countries in a bid, as he has publicly admitted, to shift the balance of votes at the UN in Israel's favour.
Relations have been particularly warm between Netanyahu and Rwandan President Paul Kagame. The two leaders have met several times in the past few years.
In June 2016, Netanyahu arrived in Rwanda's capital, Kigali, to become the first sitting Israeli prime minister to visit sub-Saharan Africa in three decades. Kagame, meanwhile, was the first African head of state to speak at the annual AIPAC Zionist lobby conference in the US last March.
""My message today is simple: Rwanda is, without question, a friend of Israel,"" Kagame said in his address.
In November, Netanyahu also announced plans to open an Israeli embassy in Kigali, in a move that fuelled rumours that Rwanda plans to take in Israel's asylum seekers.
For Awdalla, the return to Sudan turned into a long ordeal. After landing in the country, he said he was detained by the Sudanese authorities.
He spent three months in jail, where he said he shared a cramped cell with dozens of other prisoners. The space was too small for every person to sit down at the same time, Awdalla said, and the prison guards sprayed them with hot and cold water and beat them with sticks.
""I know some others who got [sent] back from Israel, some of them were tortured much worse than me. I was very lucky,"" he said.
After being released from detention, he briefly rejoined his family in a refugee camp in eastern Chad before moving to Uganda, where he is now pursuing a law degree at a local university.
""I don't think Israel will ever stop sending African refugees to Rwanda and Uganda,"" he said, describing Israel's policy as ""the worst"" and a violation of international law.
Despite being able to study and rebuild his life, he said life in Uganda is ""very, very difficult"".
""Deportees from Israel in Uganda and from Israel [in] Rwanda, these people are suffering,"" he said, urging asylum seekers who are still in Israel not to give up.

The warning was issued by six humanitarian agencies amid what they called a ""global anti-refugee backlash"", harsher conditions in regional countries who have taken in Syrians and a ""misleading rhetoric"" suggesting the country is safe for refugees to return to after victories by the Syrian government.
A new report by aid agencies including the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC), Save the Children and CARE International, said that in 2017, there were three newly displaced Syrians for each of the 721,000 internally displaced people (IDPs) and refugees who returned home.
Jan Egeland, NRC Secretary-General
""The majority of Syrian refugees and internally displaced live under terrible conditions and want to return home, but their return must be informed, voluntary, safe, assisted and protected. Now, return would neither be safe nor voluntary for the vast majority who fled the war and the violence,"" NRC Secretary-General Jan Egeland said in a statement.
The new report states that in the first nine months of 2017, 2.4 million Syrians fled their homes.
Of those who returned home last year, 37,000 had to flee again.
Most of last year's returnees were internally displaced people (IDPs), with about 66,000 refugees coming back from foreign countries.
The humanitarian agencies warned that governments in Europe and the US are putting lives at risk by closing their borders and forcing Syrian refugees back, or publicly discussing measures for it.
An NRC spokesperson told Al Jazeera the US and wealthier nations in Europe are also showing a lack of solidarity with the region.
""[They] can be doing so much more to help the refugee-hosting countries in the Middle East,"" Karl Schembri said.
Within the region, especially in Lebanon and Jordan, a lot of refugees are being deported, he continued.
""Most of the time it's grown-up males who are the breadwinners, so that pushes the entire family back to Syria.
""Besides direct deportations, some of the refugees are living in such desperate conditions.
""We've just seen people dying of the cold in Lebanon. Many of them in the region can't work because they don't have work permits.
""There are all sorts of factors pushing them to go back to Syria.""
Last year saw reduced violence in parts of Syria, but the aid agencies said the country is still ""volatile and dangerous"".
On Sunday, Russia stepped up air strikes in Idlib after one of its fighter jets was shot down there by Syrian rebels. This came days after the Syrian government carried out a suspected chlorine gas attack in the rebel-held territory of Eastern Ghouta.

Last month, having returned to Afghanistan after being deported from Finland, he was injured in a Taliban-claimed massacre in Kabul that killed more than 100 people.
As he recovered in a hospital bed, with fractured legs and ribs, Nasir remembered the tough decisions he had to make following his father's death.
In assaults across the country, the security apparatus, including local policemen, is often targeted.
Along with his mother and two brothers, the family used to spend ""every moment in a state of constant fear"".
""My mother asked us to leave. She knew after my father's death, we were in danger,"" said Nasir, using a pseudonym to protect his safety.
""It was a big decision to make. Leaving everything behind in Afghanistan, even my mother, was too difficult.""
Shortly after his father's death, his brother was also attacked by a group of unknown men. It was then that Nasir decided to flee Afghanistan.
But fewer than three years later, he was back on Afghan soil.
He claims immigration officials in Finland pressured him to sign some forms, which he did not fully understand, essentially authorising his deportation.
In recent months, European countries have tightened borders and asylum policies, resulting in large groups of refugees being pushed back to Afghanistan - a volatile country where civilian casualties are at record levels.
""About nine months have passed since I returned from Finland to Kabul, where I work as a shopkeeper,"" Nasir told Al Jazeera. ""Only my mother and my uncle's family know that I was deported. No one else, as my life is still in danger.""
Recalling his brief time in Finland, Nasir said he felt unwanted but knew he was safer than in Afghanistan.
""I remember once I wanted to buy something from a supermarket, and even though I had money to pay the shopkeeper, he refused to sell it to me.
""That bothered me a bit, but at least my life was safe there, so I let it go.""
According to Eurostat, the EU's statistical office, as of September 2017, Afghans accounted for the largest group of asylum seekers to the bloc, with 170,045 applications pending approval.
Ineligible applicants are sent back to their home country or a ""safe third country"", which is expected to provide sufficient protection.
In 2015, 33 percent of first-instance applications by Afghan asylum seekers were rejected, according to Eurostat.
By the first three quarters of 2017, more than half of first-instance applications - or 52 percent - were rejected.
Nasir said living in Afghanistan means ""facing death"" every day.
Hayat Hooman, a member of the persecuted Hazara minority, was sent back to Afghanistan from Sweden in 2016.
As a voluntary returnee from Europe, facilitated by the International Organization for Migration (IOM), he was promised financial assistance and reintegration resources.
But in July 2016, those incentives meant little when his friend was killed and he was wounded in an ISIL attack in Kabul on a peaceful protest by the Hazara minority that killed at least 80 people.
""I thought, if I get the money I will be able to start off something in Kabul that will help my family financially,"" Hooman said. ""I felt my family needed me back in Afghanistan. They are very poor and I had to return back to earn something for them.
""But the situation in Afghanistan is getting so bad every day, that I might go back and apply for asylum again with my family.
""We don't want to die. There is no protection.""
The UN documented more than 16,290 security-related incidents in the first eight months of 2017.
In June 2017, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said the situation in Afghanistan was ""intensively volatile"".
Between January 1 and June 30, 2017, UNAMA reported 5,243 civilian casualties including 1,662 deaths and 3,581 injured.
Despite the very obvious risk to citizens' safety, nine European countries - Germany, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Austria, the Netherlands, Belgium and France - are deporting or have decided to deport failed Afghan asylum seekers via the Joint Way Forward agreement between the EU and Afghanistan.
The 2016 agreement facilitates the return of thousands of Afghans. In return, the bloc promised to continue its aid package to Afghanistan.
European politicians and officials regularly describe some areas of Afghanistan as ""safe"".
But recent events have demonstrated that the security situation in Afghanistan is far from safe.
On January 21, the Taliban orchestrated a bloody siege at Kabul's Intercontinental Hotel that left at least 20 dead.
On January 24, Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL, also known as ISIS) fighters killed three people at the office of Save the Children, in the eastern city of Jalalabad.
A week later, more than 100 people lost their lives and 235 - including Nasir - were injured in the Taliban suicide attack in the heart of the capital.
In a November 2017 survey of Afghan returnees from Europe by REACH, which researches humanitarian issues, most respondents said they would make another attempt at returning to Europe.
Nasir is among those who are willing to take the risk again, he said, if he is able to fund the expensive journey.
""I know it will be difficult to get asylum, but I cannot live in fear every second in this country,"" he said. ""How is Afghanistan safe for me? I need to know if I am not safe in Kabul, where else would I be?""

On Sunday, the first wave of notices were distributed to men who are in the country without families, the Israeli daily Haaretz reported.
The 20,000 people who are not held in the country's open detention facility will be expected to leave within 60 days, or risk being imprisoned indefinitely.
According to Haaretz, the refugees will be asked to either leave for Rwanda, or back to their home countries.
Israeli officials have said the decision to refrain from forcibly deporting parents, women and children will likely change in the future.
In December, the Israeli parliament passed a bill authorising the government to force asylum seekers out of the country.
During visits to detention centres, government representatives provided refugees with a letter that listed Rwanda - and on a previous occasion, Uganda - to relocate to.
""We would like to inform you that the state of Israel has signed agreements allowing you to leave Israel for a safe third country that will absorb you and give you a residency visa that will allow you to work in that country, and promises not to remove you to your country of origin,"" the letter read, according to Haaretz.
Shortly after, Rwanda and Uganda rejected claims of signing a controversial deal to take in African migrants from the country.
Currently, Israel is home to about 40,000 asylum seekers, according to government figures. That includes 27,500 Eritrean and 7,800 Sudanese asylum seekers, the UN refugee agency (UNHCR) has reported.
Most asylum seekers in Israel are from Sudan and Eritrea who arrived over the last 10 years from neighbouring Egypt. Most have fled war, torture and other mistreatment.
Between December 2013 and June 2017, about 4,000 Sudanese and Eritrean asylum seekers were deported under Israel's ""voluntary departure programme"" to Rwanda and Uganda, according to UNHCR.
Meanwhile, Holot, a detention centre that houses some of the asylum seekers in the country's southern Negev desert, is scheduled to close down in six weeks.

The fighting started while volunteers were handing out food to refugees but later spread to other locations in the city, according to Le Monde newspaper.
Officials said a further 22 people suffered wounds, including two police officers trying to break up the fighting, which involved more than 100 Eritreans and around 20 Afghans.
Speaking to police officers on Thursday evening, French Interior Minister Gerrard Collomb described the violence as ""exceptionally serious"" and promised that those responsible would be punished.
Collomb also ordered the deployment of more police officers to the area to avoid a repeat of the events.
Calais was home to the unofficial ""jungle"" refugee camp, which housed thousands of refugees in tents, until French authorities demolished it in October 2016.
The city and neighbouring areas drew refugees and migrants from around the world due to its proximity to England, which lies at the other end of a 25-mile stretch of sea.
Many of those who had lived in the jungle moved to other areas of France, but others remained in the hope of making their way on to trucks and boats heading towards the UK.
According to local authorities, up to 800 refugees and migrants remain in Calais.
The wider Calais region has experienced previous incidents of violence, including clashes between rival human trafficking gangs.
Mass brawls between refugees have also broken out occasionally.

Al Jazeera obtained excerpts from the confidential report by the UN Office on Children and Armed Conflict, which was sent to the UN Security Council on January 19.
According to the excerpts, the Saudi-led coalition killed 68 children and wounded 36 others from July to September 2017.
The report found there were at least 20 coalition raids every day - some targeting schools and homes.
Saudi Arabia, together with several other Arab nations, launched a military campaign in 2015 that aimed at rolling back advances made by Houthi rebels after they overran much of the country, including the capital, Sanaa, in 2014.
The Saudi-led intervention initially consisted of a bombing campaign and later saw a naval blockade and the deployment of ground forces into Yemen.
The coalition says it is attacking positions of the Houthi rebels in response to a request from the internationally recognised government of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi.
In addition to the coalition, the UN report also points fingers at the Houthis, blaming the rebels for the deaths of 18 children since last summer. Another 29 children were wounded in attacks by Houthis in the same period, the report says.
The report also notes that recruitment of children to fight has increased, particularly by the Houthis and the Yemeni National Army.
The UN describes the situation in Yemen as ""the worst man-made humanitarian crisis"" in the world, with the ongoing conflict making an already dire situation worse.
Speaking to Al Jazeera from Sanaa, Shabia Mantoo, spokesperson for the UN refugee agency, UNHCR, said thousands in Yemen are in desperate need of aid.
""It's not just affecting children. It's affecting everyone. It's affecting 75 percent of the population. So our concern is that as long as this conflict continues, we're going to see more and more casualties. We're also going to see the humanitarian needs rise as well.
""So, children, women, the elderly, people with particular vulnerabilities; they are suffering the most in Yemen at the moment,"" Mantoo said.
According to the UN children's aid agency, UNICEF, more than 5,000 children have been killed or injured in the war - an average of five children a day - since the conflict escalated in March 2015.
UNICEF also says that more than 11 million children are in need of humanitarian assistance and nearly two million children are suffering from acute malnutrition.
In addition to a massive cholera outbreak, Yemen has also seen outbreaks of diphtheria in recent months.
Suze van Meegen, spokesperson of Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) in Yemen, said it is time the international community wakes up to the humanitarian situation in the country.
""It is astounding to me that we have the United Nations Security Council that has not commented on Yemen in, now more than seven months. The scale of suffering in Yemen is incomparable. We have 22 million people in need.
""We are speaking to families who are fleeing their homes because of violence and constructing houses out of plastic bags. People don't have enough to eat. They're forced to eat whatever they can find.
""This sort of suffering is inexcusable, and we would really like to see some action taken from the US, the UK and the United Nations Security Council,"" Van Meegen told Al Jazeera.

The US State Department issued a press release on Wednesday saying that Haniya ""has close links with Hamas' military wing"" and ""has been a proponent of armed struggle, including against civilians"".
Haniya's placement on the ""terror list"" means that there will be a travel ban on him, and that any US-based financial assets he may have will be frozen.
There will also be a ban on any US citizen or company from doing business with him.
.@StateDept has designated Ismail Haniyeh, Harakat al-Sabireen, Liwa al Thawra, and Harakat Sawa'd Misr (HASM) as Specially Designated Global Terrorists (SDGTs) under Section 1(b) of Executive Order (E.O.) 13224. Full details: https://t.co/6rmZD6rogE
Hamas, which governs the Israeli-occupied Gaza Strip, was founded in 1987 on a strategy of armed struggle against the occupation, and has a military wing known as the Izz al-Din al-Qassam Brigades.
Haniya, 54, was elected to be the group's political chief in May 2017, replacing Khaled Meshaal. Born in a refugee camp in Gaza, the leader has long been seen as pragmatic and flexible in his attitudes towards Israel, and support for a Palestinian state alongside the Israeli one.
Speaking to Al Jazeera from the Gaza Strip, senior Hamas official Ghazi Hamad said the US' decision is part of a wider campaign against Palestinians since President Donald Trump came into office in January 2017- one year ago.
""It is obvious that this animosity from the US administration towards the Palestinians is unprecedented - with its unconditional support of Israel and its decision surrounding Jerusalem, and cutting its funding to the UN refugee agency [UNRWA],"" said Hamad.
He added that Haniya is an ""icon of resistance"" and that is ""something he and we are all proud of"".
Hamas has not issued a formal response to the US decision, but is expected to do so later on Wednesday.
Trump has made a series of decisions in recent months that have increased tensions in the region.
In a major break with decades of US policy, Trump announced on December 6 that the US formally recognises Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, and will begin the process of moving its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. The move unleashed protests across the occupied Palestinian territories and in major cities around the world.
And, on January 17, the US government decided to cut more than half of its planned funding to the UN aid agency for Palestinian refugees - an institution that has been the lifeline to more than five million registered Palestinian refugees for over 70 years.
The State Department accused Hamas of being involved in attacks that have resulted in the killing of 17 Americans since the group's founding.
Al Jazeera's Rosiland Jordan, reporting from Washington, DC, said this designation raises the possibility of the US placing Haniya on trial.
""This possibly makes it easier for the US Justice Department to try to bring him to trial for his alleged role in the deaths of these 17 Americans"".

""This decision demonstrates the full American bias in favour of the Israeli occupation, and provides an official cover for Israeli crimes against the Palestinian people,"" the statement added.
Hamas, the Palestinian political movement that governs the Israeli-occupied Gaza Strip, said it calls on the US administration to ""reverse"" this decision and to stop its ""hostile policies.
""This will not deter us from carrying out our duties towards our people and defending them, and liberating our lands and holy sites"".

The deadline is due to expire on Wednesday, with Pakistan’s federal cabinet expected to discuss the matter during a weekly meeting.
Separately, Afghan Interior Minister Wais Ahmad Barmak and intelligence chief Mohamed Masoom Stanekzai also arrived in the Pakistani capital Islamabad for talks on Wednesday.
Pakistan has extended the validity of Afghan refugees' 'Proof of Registration' (PoR) cards at least six times in the past, but the last extension - granted on January 3, days after the refugees' status expired - was for only a month, the shortest ever awarded.
""Pakistan's economy has carried the burden of hosting Afghan refugees since long and in the present circumstances cannot sustain it further,"" read a government statement released after that extension.
The refugees have become a bone of contention in the increasing souring diplomatic relations between Pakistan and the United States, with the South Asian country accusing them of being a ""security risk"".
On Thursday, following a US drone strike in the northwestern Pakistani district of Kurram, Pakistan’s military said that the target had been hiding in an Afghan refugee camp.
""This validates Pakistan's stance that left over terrorists easily morph into Afghan refugees' camps/complexes,"" the military said in a statement.
""Thus their early and dignified return to Afghanistan is essential.""
Pakistan is home to at least 1.38 million registered Afghan refugees, according to the UNHCR. There are at least another million refugees estimated to be outside the formal refugee registration system.
""The 2.3 million refugees in Pakistan, it is impossible for all of them to go back immediately,"" says Baryali Miankhel, the president of an Afghan refugee welfare organisation in the northwestern province of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, where most reside. ""We have told the Pakistani government this.""
Last year, more than 150,000 refugees left Pakistan to return to their native Afghanistan. Of those, more than 59,000 were registered refugees assisted by the UNHCR, while the rest either spontaneously returned or were deported by Pakistan.
UNHCR says it is concerned at the increasingly shorter durations of extensions being offered to Afghan refugees regarding their legal status in the country.
""In terms of the length of time for the PoR extensions, the deadlines that are created for those registered Afghan refugees do create some uncertainty for refugees,"" Dan McNorton, the UNHCR spokesperson in Pakistan, told Al Jazeera. ""That is certainly something that UNHCR has been concerned about in the past, and […] that remains the case.""
Refugees themselves testify that the shorter extensions have been leading some to choose to leave the country, despite an uncertain security situation in their home country.
""Refugees are leaving because of the shorter extensions from the government of Pakistan, that is one of the reasons,"" said Miankhel. ""Because there is no peace in Afghanistan, there are no opportunities for employment or even a place to live.""
The security situation in Afghanistan, where US-led coalition forces and the Afghan army continue to battle the Afghan Taliban for control of areas of the country, has been deteriorating in recent weeks.
On Sunday, at least 103 people were killed in a suicide attack in the heart of the capital Kabul.
A day later, at least 11 soldiers were killed when gunmen attacked a military academy, also in Kabul.
Afghanistan and the United States have regularly blamed Pakistan for allegedly providing safe havens to elements of the Afghan Taliban and Haqqani Network armed groups. Pakistan denies the charge, alleging that it is Afghan forces that offer sanctuary to elements of the Pakistani Taliban.
In a rare development, Pakistan's foreign ministry on Tuesday announced that it had handed over 27 individuals suspected of having links to the Haqqani Network and the Afghan Taliban in November.
""Pakistan continues to push any suspected [Afghan Taliban] and [Haqqani Network] elements to prevent them from using our soil for any terrorist activity in Afghanistan,"" said Muhammad Faisal, the foreign ministry spokesperson.

A Thai court found Sam Sokha, a Cambodian labour rights activist, guilty of overstaying her visa in early January, despite the UN refugee agency's (UNHCR) recognition of her status as a refugee, her lawyer Koreeyor Manuchae told Al Jazeera on Wednesday.
Sokha was handed a suspended sentence and a fine, but was being held at an immigration dentention centre in the Thai capital, Bangkok, Manuchae said, where the 38-year-old activist reported receiving a visit from Cambodian officials who pressured her to return.
""But deporting her to Cambodia is like sending her to her death,"" Manuchae said, adding that Sokha was ""very worried"".
Sokha's detention is the latest in Thailand's ""long and chequered record of violating the human rights of refugees,"" said Olof Blomqvist, a spokesman for Amnesty International.
Thailand, which hosts more than 100,000 refugees, is not party to the international convention on refugees, he said, and treats any refugee living outside of designated camps on the Thai border with Myanmar as an undocumented immigrant.
Without legal status, refugees living in urban areas in and around Bangkok are often subject to arrest and deportation, according to rights groups.
Sokha has been living in Bangkok since April last year.
She fled Cambodia after the police there launched an investigation into a video clip on Facebook, which shows her throwing a shoe at the image of Hun Sen on a billboard of the ruling Cambodian People's Party (CPP). She throws a second shoe at the picture of Hun Sen's party colleague, National Assembly President Heng Samrin.
""This person, when will he stop destroying the nation?"" she is heard saying in the video, which was widely shared on social media. In an interview with the Phnom Penh Post newspaper at the time, Sokha said she posted the video because she was ""hurt"" by Hun Sen's leadership.
""My aunt's land was grabbed. And they arrested and jailed my brother and he even could not find an attorney.""
Shortly afterwards, prosecutors pressed charges of ""insulting a public official"" and ""incitement"" against her. The offences carry a three year jail term.
The move against Sokha came amid a sweeping crackdown on dissent in Cambodia. Opposition leader Kem Sokha was arrested and charged with ""treason and espionage"" later in September.
That same month, nearly a dozen radio stations were forced off the air, and the Cambodia Daily newspaper also stopped publishing over allegations of tax evasion. Weeks later, in November, the country's Supreme Court dissolvedKem Sokha's Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP), leaving the ruling party unopposed in parliament and ahead of general elections later this year.
The crackdown has forced several CNRP members of parliament into exile, with many seeking refuge in Thailand.
In a statement last week, Amnesty said the dissidents, as well as other asylum seekers and refugees have reported ""increased surveillance, harassment and intimidation"" by Thai police officers and Cambodian agents.
Sokha's arrest has prompted widespread fear in Bangkok's refugee community, activists said.
A Vietnamese dissident, A Ga, who fled political and religious persecution in his country, was also arrested and sentenced along his wife and 10-year-old-son earlier this month, and is being held at the same facility as Sokha.
Human rights groups said Thailand, in recent years, has forcibly returned more than a hundred refugees and asylum seekers based on the requests of foreign governments.
These include the repatriation of M. Furkan Sokmen, a Turkish national alleged to have links to an exiled cleric that Turkey accuses of being behind a failed coup attempt in July 2016, and the return of 109 people of the persecuted Uighur Muslim minority to China in 2015, according to Human Rights Watch.
Blomqvist, the Amnesty spokesman, said Thailand ""has often completely ignored the principle of non-refoulement, an absolute prohibition in international law on sending refugees back to territories where they could face human rights violations.
""Whether by denying safe harbour to boats carrying desperate Rohingya refugees, or sending activists back to countries like Bahrain and China, where they could face torture, Thai authorities routinely failed to protect people in need.""
A Thai immigration official meanwhile confirmed that Cambodian authorities were interested in Sokha's case, but dismissed the claim that Cambodian officials had paid a visit to the activist at Bangkok's Suan Phlu Immigration Detention Facility.
""There were requests from the country of origin,"" the official, who did not want to be named as he was not authorised to speak to the media, told Al Jazeera.
He declined to reveal the nature of the request, and said: ""If we find they [asylum seekers] violate our laws, we have to follow our process, whether there is a request or not"".
He added: ""We haven't got any date or confirmation of when Sokha will be deported or if we will deport them at all.""
The Cambodian government could not be reached for comment.
A spokesman for the Cambodian foreign ministry, however, told the Phnom Penh Post that he was not aware of any extradition requests.

That was three years ago. Noyona and Yasmin fled a military crackdown in Myanmar in 2012.
Noyona said the trafficker was arrested in India and Yasmin was rescued. Her daughter is living at a safe house for other trafficking victims in Kolkata.
Myanmar stripped the Rohingya of citizenship in 1982, which means Noyona and Yasmin do not have passports so they cannot be reunited.
Noyona saves a little money every month to chat to her daughter for a few minutes on the phone.
""Only God knows the pain I experience every day,"" she said. ""I don't have money to go to India. My daughter warns me not to try and cross into India without passport.""
Noyona's story is not uncommon in the Rohingya refugee camps.
Rights groups say trafficking gangs have worked in the Rohinga camps for years but the recent influx of more than 650,000 refugees has made the trafficking situation even worse.
A trafficker
Al Jazeera spoke to a trafficker who said men often come from outside the camp and pay families for their daughters promising them work. The girls are often never seen again, he said.
""We sit by the road and the men come to us,"" said the trafficker on condition of anonymity.
""They ask if we can get the helpless type of people here. Families are ready to provide girls because they don't have enough food.""
Men often specifically want girls of a certain age and pay the families about $60 for each, he said.
""The men ask me for girls around 12-14 years old,"" he said. ""They tell me they have difficulty with domestic work at their homes. They say they need someone to cook for them.""
The United Nations' refugee agency is trying to help Noyona be reunited with her daughter. But it says only the Bangladesh authorities can make the decision.
Noyona is afraid she may die without ever seeing Yasmin again.
""I want nothing more than my daughter back,"" she said. ""It would be so kind if you can get my daughter back. My Yasmin is a piece of my heart.""

Yeoh, a goodwill ambassador for the UN Development Programme, visited sprawling refugee camps in Bangladesh's Cox's Bazar on Saturday, as part of a Malaysian delegation led by the Southeast Asian nation's military chief. The team visited a hospital set up by Malaysia and distributed relief goods in another camp.
""It is very important that we're here, because what the Rohingya people are going through is despicable and it's very, very tragic. It should not be allowed,"" she said. ""Every single one of them deserves to have the human rights that should be given to them.""
Nearly 700,000 Rohingya have fled Myanmar since August, in what the UN has described as ethnic cleansing. Myanmar's military has denied the charges, saying they were conducting ""clearance operations"" following attacks by Rohingya fighters on police posts.
Yeoh was most recently seen in sci-fi TV series ""Star Trek: Discovery"". She also played Myanmar's leader Aung San Suu Kyi in ""The Lady"", a 2011 biopic about the Nobel Peace laureate's struggle to bring democracy to her country.
Aung San Suu Kyi has faced widespread international criticism for not speaking out in defence of the Rohingya. Former New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson resigned from an advisory panel on the crisis this past week, calling it a ""whitewash and a cheerleading operation"" for Aung San Suu Kyi.

Policy Agenda, a private Hungarian polling firm commissioned by local media to survey voter expectations, listed a number of parties running for election, including the ""George Soros Party"" - which does not exist.
Some 64 percent of respondents said they did not believe the party of the 87-year-old Hungarian American billionaire, known for his support of liberal causes, would win.
Only 24 percent of those polled were aware the party was made up by the polling firm.
Soros has been characterised - both by far-right activists and members of the Hungarian government's ruling party Fidesz - as wanting to dilute the Christian nature of Europe by opening its borders to refugees from predominately Muslim nations.
""George Soros' network is working to ensure that as many people as possible reach Europe, because they believe this is what will ensure the future of the continent,"" Hungarian government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs told a local radio station in January.
""This is a political programme in which organisations that help migrants are taking part 'disguised' as human rights organisations,'"" Kovacs said.
A nationwide survey on the ""Soros Plan"" was completed at the end of 2017. Kovacs said in January more than two million questionnaires were returned.
The Soros Plan was ""unanimously"" rejected by Hungarians, he said.
The Hungarian government introduced legislation on January 17 that aims to penalise foreign-funded NGOs that support refugees and immigrants.
Kovacs called it the ""Stop Soros"" bill. It would make such NGOs pay a 25 percent tax on foreign donations.
The bill was derided by rights groups and critics of the government. It was the latest in a long line of heavily criticised measures from the Fidesz government.
In June, NGOs were required to register with the government and disclose if they receive foreign funding.
Amnesty International promised to challenge ""Hungary's repressive new NGO law in the courts.""
The rights group had no intention of complying with the law ""until all these avenues have been exhausted"", Julia Ivan, director of Amnesty International Hungary, said at the time.
When Hungary goes to the polls on April 8, a wide range of parties will have a chance to win votes. According to a database kept by Hungary's National Office of the Judiciary, there are 250 political parties in the country of 10 million.
About 120 of these parties were founded since the last national election in 2014, with 70 registered in 2017 alone.
Hungary's opposition has lost elections since the mainstream Socialist Party was rocked by corruption scandals that led to its defeat in 2010.
Fidesz won that year with a two-thirds majority and made Viktor Orban prime minister.
Orban, who studied at Oxford thanks to scholarship funding from Soros, has adopted an anti-refugee, anti-migrant stance that has remained popular as voters in central and Eastern Europe have turned to the far-right.
Fidesz won nearly 45 percent of the vote in the 2014 elections, enough to form a majority government.
Polls show the ruling party with the support of 51 percent of Hungarian voters as of January 16.
Still, roughly two percent of Hungarians said the Soros Party could win the election, according to the Policy Agenda poll.

He shuffles through several folded up pieces of paper until he finds what he's looking for: two official Tunisian identity cards.
The country's flag - red and white, with a crescent and star at the centre - is on the top left-hand corner of each card, while the unsmiling faces of his two sons stare back at him in black and white.
""I didn't know about their plan to leave the country in this way,"" said the 53-year-old father of four, solemnly.
Sitting outside the small, one-room workshop where he repairs old television sets and radios in Ouardia, a southern neighbourhood of Tunisia's capital, he explained that his son, Soufiane, was 19 when he left Tunisia in 2008.
Three years later, another son Wissam was also 19 when he took the same risky journey across the Mediterranean Sea as his older brother: both young men chose to migrate to Italy on boats with the help of people-smugglers.
Soufiane left via Libya while Wissam took a vessel from the Tunisian port city of Sfax hoping to find high-paying jobs in European countries and make enough money to help support their family.
They are just two of many Tunisians who have taken dangerous, undocumented journeys to Europe for years in search of work and a better life.
While the crossings are certainly not new, some now fear the country's increasingly dire economic situation and widespread lack of jobs will push even more young people to try to cross the Mediterranean once winter is over.
Since he left Tunisia in 2011, Wissam's whereabouts remain unknown, Rhimi said. His other son, Soufiane, has been in and out of jail because of drugs and other illegal activities.
Despite this difficult history with undocumented migration, Rhimi said he can only watch as his youngest son Souhail, 17, contemplates making the same choice as his older brothers.
He is almost resigned to the possibility that one day Souhail will be gone.
""I'm tired,"" Rhimi said. ""I'm always explaining to [Souhail], 'Look how I lost your two brothers.' But he doesn't understand what I'm saying because at night he sits with other kids in the neighbourhood and they talk about leaving for Italy.""
Most Tunisians leave for Europe from the country's coastal cities, such as Sfax, with the help of smugglers who take them to Italy by boat.
Others have been smuggled out of Libya where African asylum seekers have reported widespread torture and mistreatment. Recent media reports also revealed how some asylum seekers in Libya are being sold into slavery.
After the 2011 revolution that toppled Tunisian President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, tens of thousands of Tunisians migrated without permits to Europe, with most arriving on Italy's Lampedusa island and the Italian mainland.
The number of crossings stabilised in the years after the uprising, but there has been an uptick in undocumented crossings in recent months.
Last October, about 2,700 people crossed to Italy from Tunisia, and almost all of them were Tunisian citizens, the UN refugee agency (UNHCR) reported.
Tunisia's struggling economy and its high unemployment rate - about 35 percent of Tunisian youth are unemployed - have been blamed for pushing many to take desperate journeys abroad.
This month, the government's 2018 budget came into effect, raising taxes and the price of several basic goods, including gasoline and food.
The austerity measures led to widespread protests across Tunisia and calls for the government to cancel the budget altogether.
Economic and social issues are the main factors pushing youth to migrate to Europe, according to the Tunisian Forum for Economic and Social Rights (TFESR), a research group.
""The absence of development, the weak economic situation in Tunisia seven years after the revolution, the violation of economic and social rights, and political instability are the factors for migration,"" the group said in a report last year.
Most people leaving Tunisia are between the ages of 20 and 30 and ""are uneducated youth who are unemployed or have precarious jobs"", TFESR said.
Nicholas Noe, editor of MideastWire.com, a newswire that translates articles from the region into English, said Tunisia's economic problems stem from a nexus of control that exists between security agencies such as the police, traditional mafias, and more than 100 families that hold monopolies over key industries.
""If the [European Union] does not want to have another failed state on the Mediterranean, it's going to have to decide whether [it wants] to tax hair gel and have social revolution, or address the fundamental problems at the elite level,"" Noe told Al Jazeera.
One in three young Tunisian men living in rural parts of the country (33.4 percent) are not employed, in school or a training programme, according to 2014 World Bank figures.
In Sidi Bouzid, the city where the 2011 revolution began, 24-year-old Mahran Alaoui said he did not even have enough money to approach the smugglers who could take him by boat to Europe.
Sharing a cigarette with three friends on a city bench, Alaoui said he left school at age 13 and is currently unemployed. He sometimes does shifts as a server in a restaurant but said that only brings him 15 Tunisian dinars ($6) for 12 hours of work.
""We've reached the peak of hopelessness,"" he told Al Jazeera.
""But at least we have a belief in God. Otherwise, we would have committed suicide.""
Mohamed-Dhia Hammami, a Tunisian political analyst, told Al Jazeera that frustration has also increased among educated Tunisian youth, who have been unable to find jobs after graduating.
He said several hundred Tunisians from the towns of Moulares and Mitlawi, in the western governorate of Gafsa, recently crossed the border without permits into Algeria in search of better opportunities.
A few days later, several dozen others attempted to get to Algeria through the official border crossing, but they were turned back, Hammami said.
""They are leaving a boat that is [sinking],"" he said.
Sidi Bouzid high school students Hayat Ardhawi, 17, and Mariam Tlili, 16, said they were already thinking about where they would move if they got the chance to leave Tunisia.
""After I finish school I want to go to Canada,"" Ardhawi said. She told Al Jazeera she wants to be a doctor, but ""in Sidi Bouzid, there's nothing"".
Tlili said she wanted to live and work as a midwife in France. ""We love Sidi Bouzid,"" she added. ""We'll come back.""
Back in Ouardia, Rhimi told Al Jazeera he spends all his free time searching for information about his sons.
He hasn't heard from Wissam since he left for Italy in 2011 and has only sporadic contact with Soufiane.
He said he approached Tunisian authorities several times to try to locate Wissam and even left a DNA sample with a hospital in Sfax in case his son's body is pulled from the sea.
But so far, he has no new information. ""Nobody is helping me,"" Rhimi said.
""But I lost two sons, so I don't care. I'm not afraid of death... I'm carrying on.""

Has life changed for Tunisia after the revolution?

The fate of the Rohingya refugee hung in the balance this week when a plan to repatriate members of the persecuted, mostly Muslim minority from Bangladesh to Myanmar's Rakhine state looked like it may begin on Tuesday.
That plan has now been put on hold, but Ahmed and others living in this informal camp near the village of Gundum, less than a kilometre from his home in Myanmar, cannot stop thinking about their possible return.
""Bangladesh is not my motherland, Myanmar is my motherland,"" Ahmed said. ""If the situation calms down I want to return home, and with that hope, I'm staying here.""
Phone service in the camp is spotty, but refugees here regularly climb a nearby hill to get better connectivity. There, they stay on top of developments related to repatriation through Bangladesh and Myanmar government updates on social media.
""Every day after the evening prayer we go to the top of the hill and find out [what's happening] through Facebook,"" he said.
The refugees in this camp are just a fraction of the 650,000 plus Rohingya who have fled Myanmar over the past five months following a brutal military crackdown against their community.
But many here know they could be among the first to be repatriated because they live in ambiguous territory - no man's land.
It's a name that drips with irony. Despite having lived in Myanmar for generations, many Rohingya are denied legal recognition there and are commonly viewed as illegal migrants from Bangladesh. And, although the Bangladesh government says there are now more than one million Rohingya living within its borders, it too does not see the Rohingya as its own. When it comes to nationality, the men who live in this camp are literally without a nation.
The location of their camp comes with many complications. Aid agencies can't access the camp directly and Bangladesh's involvement is also limited.
Still, they choose to continue living in no man's land. And their hesitancy to move into Bangladesh belies a connection they still feel to Myanmar - the only country they've ever called home - despite the persecution they face there.
Ahmed is a man caught in between, both in terms of where he currently lives, and where he hopes to go. The United Nations has called Myanmar's crackdown ""a textbook example of ethnic cleansing"", and Ahmed was well aware of this reality, and how it makes returning home a distant idea.
""They are killing and firing at people, throwing children into fires alive, raping women. It is not a suitable place for anyone to live.""
Though it is now unclear when repatriation might begin, both Myanmar and Bangladesh say they are working towards it. The governments signed an agreement on the issue in November, and reports indicate 1,500 people would be moved across the border per week.
But humanitarian organisations have expressed major doubts over the plan's logistics and worry that there aren't enough safeguards in place to protect the Rohingya upon their return.
Rohingya who spoke to Al Jazeera agreed. Community leaders at a nearby camp voiced similar concerns over the weekend, issuing a list of demands for Myanmar to meet before willingly returning to the country.
These include the granting of citizenship, legal recognition of their community, and the return of their land.
Myanmar has said those who can prove residency in the country can return. But that's much easier said than done, as a long history of Rohingya being denied access to meaningful documentation shows.
Ahmed and others who live in no man's land showed Al Jazeera an array of official cards and papers they had been previously issued by Myanmar. But as they excitedly laid them out on a table, it became increasingly clear these documents will likely have little effect if repatriation occurs. None provide them with the citizenship rights they say they deserve, and at best offer temporary status in the country.
There's one document that elicits particular emotion in the camp, the National Verification Card (NVCs) - identification given to people while the government decides if they're entitled to citizenship - is seen by many to confirm the outsider status of those who have them. Those who don't are happy to advertise it.
""It is for the foreigners only. If you want to stay in Myanmar and get Myanmar citizenship ... then you apply for this card,"" insisted Ahmed's friend Dil Mohammed, who goes on to make it clear the Rohingya are different. ""We are original citizens.""
Mohammed says he has a different identification, known as a National Registration Card (NRC), which he believes would grant him legal recognition if he were to return to Myanmar.
But he is still afraid to return, especially after receiving a message earlier this month. It showed a photograph of his face on an image pushed online by the Myanmar government of alleged members of the Arakan Salvation Rohingya Army (ARSA).
The armed group's attack on border posts in Myanmar in August prompted the military crackdown that drove the Rohingya to Bangladesh. When Mohammed saw the online post, which also claimed he was a part of the attacks, he couldn't believe his eyes.
""It was very very bad... I was shocked. I don't know ARSA. So why is the Myanmar government accusing me of being with ARSA?""
Ahmed listens closely to his friend's story before adding a cynical note.
""My photo hasn't come up yet, but it will come. For sure, it will come.""

The revelations sent shock waves globally and sparked protests outside Libyan embassies across Africa and Europe.
Libya is a major transit destination for migrants and refugees hoping to reach Europe by sea.
Human trafficking networks have prospered amid lawlessness, created by the warring militias that have been fighting for control of territories since the toppling of Muammar Gaddafi in 2011.
According to the International Organization for Migration, there are 700,000 - 1 million migrants in Libya.
Al Jazeera gained access to two Eritrean men sold multiple times and still trapped in Libya.
Through conversations via a smuggled phone, we managed to communicate with the two Eritreans stuck in Libya. Here is a first-person account of their lives, trapped in a war zone.
Sami left Eritrea when he was 15 years old. He travelled to Ethiopia and from there he made it to Sudan. From Sudan, he was smuggled into Libya via Chad, after paying smugglers $1,500.
Sami, 18-year-old Eritrean refugee
On the Libyan border, he was caught and told by the Libyans he had been sold by the Chadian smugglers and needed to pay more money. ""They asked me to pay $6,500 more to proceed further,"" he said.
""We were lied to. They beat us with sticks and a water hose. And they electrocuted us. We told them we had no money, but that did not stop them from beating us.
My mother had to sell our home in Eritrea and other assets we had and was also forced to borrow money from family and friends abroad for my trip.
They then took us to the town of the Libyan Bani Walid, where we were held in an illegal detention centre. They gave us one piece of bread a day. We endured physical torture but the mental torture was worse. Our captors would systematically choose people unable to pay to set an example.
Sami, 18-year-old Eritrean refugee
They would hang them upside down and beat them. They would electrocute their nipples and waterboard them. They would pour hot oil on them and burn them. We saw people dying while being tortured. My friend died in front of me after he was electrocuted. He came with me and we survived the journey through the desert only for him to die as a slave in captivity. Watching others being tortured made people call anyone they could for them to send money by any means. They made us call while being tortured.
The first time they tortured me they asked me to pay. I said I don't have the money, my father is dead and I only have my mother. They asked me if I had relatives in Europe, to which I said no.
They were not pleased, so they hanged me upside down and beat me everywhere and electrocuted me. They called my mother while I was being tortured so she could hear my screams.
The detention centre had people from Eritrea, Somalia, Sudan and Ethiopia, as well as Nigeria and other West African countries.
At night, it used to be worse. The guards would get high on drugs and resort to beating, abuse and torture.

Women and children were kept separate from the men. Many girls and women were raped and had children as a result of it. Our buildings were close to each other so we would hear their screams and cries.
I stayed in detention for nine months. Once my mother secured the money, they let me go.
Upon my release, I boarded a truck with others on the way to the sea. We were stopped by another vehicle after armed men started shooting at our truck.
Our Libyan driver escaped and the men asked us who we were and where we were going. They took us and said we had to pay for our freedom if we wanted to be allowed to go to the sea and travel to Europe.
They asked us for money in exchange for freedom. When they inquired about my religion I lied to them that I was a Muslim, hoping they would treat me better.
I was lucky because they asked me for less money, which I was able to secure eventually. I spent two months there, in a town called Az Zawiya.
Sami, 18-year-old Eritrean refugee
We were held in an apartment building complex from where we were not allowed to go out.
After paying the ransom, they took me from Az Zawiya to the sea. But we were stopped by Libyan coast guards, who took us to Tripoli.
In Tripoli, they demanded 1,000 euros ($1,225) in order for a person to be released.
Then the coast guards sold us to an Eritrean smuggler who goes by the name Walid. He is notorious and runs a smuggling network with Libyans and others. His real name is Tawalde but the Libyans call him Walid. He is responsible for the torture and killing of many.
We were taken back to Bani Walid.
They kept us in a large, container-like shed. It was really a cramped area with around 320 of us and had one toilet to share. I stayed there for three months.
There were women and children in the same container as the men, children as young as two years, and there were infants born as a result of rape by the Libyan captors.
Walid was stingy with food. He would starve us and say we would receive food if we could transfer money. He would say ""No money no food, you can die of hunger for all I care.""
In order for us to leave we had to pay $2,200. I spent two months there.
Most days we got either no food or one piece of bread so we were hungry all the time.
The whole day and night we would just sleep and lie down without being allowed out and seeing daylight.
The scariest thing was not knowing if you would ever be freed.
Towards the end of my captivity, a Libyan man came and took me to do farming work in return for food and shelter.
After two days, I managed to escape and found shelter in a mosque. I just started cleaning there. Whenever someone would ask me who I was, I would say I was the cleaner and they would leave me alone.
There I found another Libyan man, who said he would help me get to Tripoli if I paid 750 Libyan dinar.
I told him I had no money. So, instead, he took me to his home, where I had to work for two months before he took me to Tripoli as promised. This was in September 2017.
When I arrived in Tripoli, I registered with UNHCR. I found a job as the caretaker of a mosque, where I can also sleep. This is where I am today.
Yonathan Tekle, 24-year-old Eritrean refugee
I clean the mosque and I close it at night. I help other Eritreans trapped in Tripoli by making them pasta and other simple food and they also stay with me overnight in the mosque.
No one bothers us here and it's warm inside.
I left Eritrea in search of freedom and peace. I did not want to live under dictatorship, that is why I left. I knew before leaving Eritrea that the journey would be tough. But I had no idea people would be so cruel and inhumane.
I never thought I would be sold and resold. Looking back now, had I known what was awaiting me, I probably would have stayed back in Eritrea despite the hardships there.
But now I have no choice, I can't go back. My mother is in debt because of me. So, I must continue.
I must help her now. She lost her home because of me. I must pay off her debt.
I want to study psychology to help people with mental illness. My mother suffered from it, and I want to help people like her.
It's OK if I die in the sea. It's better than the hell I saw in Libya and the hell awaiting me in Eritrea if I return. If I make it anywhere in Europe I might have a chance.""
*For security reasons, Sami does not want to be identified by photo or with his real name.
For the past five months, he's being held inside a container illegally in the town of Gharyan, 91km from the capital, Tripoli.
Yonathan was a soldier before deserting and fleeing Eritrea in December 2016.
He had arranged for Sudanese smugglers to take him to Libya - and the journey became more hazardous and expensive than he had ever imagined.
After he crossed the border into Sudan, the smugglers demanded more money than agreed to take him to Khartoum. He had to call home and scramble for money.
""They tortured us, beat us and burned us. I called my family and told them we are in hell, we need money or they will not let us go.
They would pour water inside my mouth while beating me. They would stuff cloth into my mouth while beating me with a stick and a whip.
I spent three months held in captivity there until I secured $6,000 through my family, who gathered it from relatives and friends in Eritrea and abroad.
Then the smugglers took me to Khartoum. I worked there as a hotel cleaner. I spent almost six months there before I paid smugglers to take me to Libya. The trip cost me $1,600.
When I entered Libya, I was captured by Libyans wearing uniforms. They told me ""We can't let you travel to the sea to cross over to Europe.""
They took me and the group I was travelling with to an area far away from the coast. They handed us over to a group with Sudanese and Eritrean smugglers in charge.
That is when I found out we had been sold.
Our new captors told us we had been sold by the Libyans and we had to pay $5,000.
I have been here for five months now.
We are kept indoors 24/7 with no access to running water or daylight.
Yonathan Tekle, 24-year-old Eritrean refugee
I smuggled the phone in here and my family knows I am here, but they are helpless.
For the majority of the people held with me, their families know nothing about them. No one knows if they are dead or alive.
We are scared because we have not seen a single person from the outside since coming here.
We know detainees in other containers have been in touch with Eritrean-Swedish journalist and human rights defender Meron Estefanos.
You are the first one to contact us, we have had no one calling us from the outside.
Every Sunday, they tell us they will release us within two weeks, but then the time passes and nothing happens. When they first took us, they said we must pay money in order to be freed. But for weeks now they have not asked for money to release us.
They are just keeping us here without any information. We don't know what is going to happen to us.
The container is made of tin. It's really cold right now, you feel it in your bones. We have a blanket each. But with the hunger, you feel the cold even more.
We sleep and wake up in the same place awaiting our fate. We don't know if we will ever make it out.
We have many sick people among us without any access to medicine or doctors. We don't move much because we are so weak and hungry, we just sleep. One Somali man has died
I don't see any positive end to this. We all keep our pain and fears inside and we just sleep.

The thought of returning to Eritrea is like returning to another, bigger prison. If I was returned there against my will, I would try to get out again.
The moment I was told by the Sudanese and Eritrean smugglers the Libyans had sold me, my stomach turned inside out.

Authorities in the country's Anglophone region have blocked access to social media and messaging apps for almost four months in an ongoing attempt to quell criticism aimed against the government.
It is the second internet shutdown within a year in the West African nation.
""Cameroonians have come to expect internet restrictions when they voice their dissent against the government; they have accepted this has become a way of life,"" Judith Nwana, a US-based Cameroonian human rights activist with a background in telecommunications, told Al Jazeera.
""When it first happened, we were all taken unaware because we never imagined that this could happen in Cameroon. Then there was the gradual acceptance that the crisis was threatening the government and we were living in an oppressive regime,"" she added.
That first shutdown happened in January 2017, after Anglophone teachers, lawyers and students went on strike over alleged bias in favour of Francophones.
The Anglophones claimed they face discrimination and that they were excluded from state jobs as a result of their limited French language skills.
""The Anglophone regions feel neglected and left out of the national government's agenda,"" Peter Micek of digital rights organisation Access Now told Al Jazeera.
""Then, the government took the extreme measure to shut down the internet completely,"" he said.
The first shutdown lasted 93 days, from January to April 2017.
""It was devastating. People didn’t know how to work around it,"" Judith Nwana said, adding that the whole society was affected; education, money transfers, healthcare and businesses all relied on internet access, which was now shutdown.
Eventually, internet access was restored in April after international pressure from, among others, the United Nations and Pope Francis.
However, in October a second, more targeted shutdown was enacted after renewed protests in the Anglophone areas.
The new blockade took aim at social media and messaging apps. Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and WhatsApp were all shut down.
But by this time, many Cameroonians were prepared, using VPN services to circumvent the blockade.
""Unfortunately, VPNs are expensive and not everyone can afford one or had budgeted for one. Regardless, businesses, the tech industry, healthcare and education are seriously affected,"" Nwana said.
One of those affected businesses belongs to Mambe Churchill Nanje, a software engineer and CEO and founder of Njorku, a search engine that allows people all over Africa to look for jobs.
Nanje is based in Silicon Mountain, a tech-hub based and around in the city of Buea, which was hit hard by both shutdowns.
""They not only affected me and my business, but the whole of Silicon Mountain,"" Nanje told Al Jazeera.
""It has pushed out a lot of the talent [at Silicon Mountain]. They had to leave because they can't work. They either moved to other parts of Cameroon or out of the country,"" he said.
As the shutdowns continued, many Cameroonians were forced to travel back and forth to regions with internet access to conduct business or access vital information.
""They came together and formed an internet refugee camp along the border with the littoral region, where others could come and get internet access from the neighbouring region,"" Nwana said.
The first shutdown alone cost the country at least $38m, Nwana added. The effects of the second blockade are not as severe economically, but Nwana emphasised there is more than just monetary loss.
""Shutting down social media sites is akin to shutting down the internet. It's how people communicate today. Cases have been recorded of people missing deadlines or scholarships and opportunities when the information is put on social media,"" she said.
""Those in Anglophone Cameroon don’t get to see this, which reinforces the feeling of marginalisation and discrimination,"" Nwana added.
Micek echoed Nwana's sentiment, saying the economic effect is big but also not the only thing that is lost because of these shutdowns.
""The Silicon Mountain region is a hub of innovation and that has suffered enormously. Besides, the economy is integrated, so getting services from the Silicon Mountain area is gonna be hard, wherever people are in the country, either in the Anglophone or Francophone regions,"" Micek said.
""And this blockade prevents not just Cameroonians but all of us from accessing businesses, personal stories and other rich content from these areas in Cameroon,"" Micek said.
""The whole world suffers because of these shutdowns.""

The UN's migration and refugee agencies said on Friday that the boat, overcrowded with at least 152 Somalis and Ethiopians, had departed from the Al Buraiqa coast in Aden on January 23.
The International Organization for Migration (IOM) and UNHCR said the vessel was believed to have been operated by ""unscrupulous smugglers"" who were trying to bring refugees and migrants to Djibouti ""while trying to extort more money from them"".
In a statement, the UN said the boat had capsized ""amid reports of gunfire being used against the passengers"".
Of all passengers on board, 101 were Ethiopian, and 51 were Somali.
""As we have been saying for almost five years now, the preservation of human life is our utmost priority everywhere,"" IOM Director William Lacy Swing said.
""Yemen is no exception; we are deeply troubled by reports of this latest incident.""
The ongoing civil war in Yemen exposes refugees to further human rights abuses, including arbitrary arrest, detention, trafficking and deportation.
So far this year, the IOM has recorded at least 349 migrant fatalities across the world.

The letter warned of ""dire consequences"" if the cut to the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian Refugees (UNRWA) was maintained, according to the letter seen by Al Jazeera on Thursday.
""We are deeply concerned by the humanitarian consequences of this decision on life-sustaining assistance to children, women and men in Jordan, Lebanon, Syria and the West Bank and Gaza Strip,"" it said.
""Whether it is emergency food aid, access to primary healthcare, access to primary education, or other critical support to vulnerable populations, there is no question that these cuts, if maintained, will have dire consequences.""
The letter was sent on Wednesday to US Ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, National Security Advisor HR McMaster, and Secretary of Defence James Mattis.
Eric Schwartz, president of Refugees International
Eric Schwartz, president of Refugees International and former US Assistant Secretary of State for Population, Refugees and Migration, said comments by Nikki Haley, the US ambassador to the UN, were aimed at punishing Palestinian political leaders and forcing them to make concessions.
""But it is wrong to punish political leaders by denying life-sustaining aid to civilians,"" he said in the letter.
""This is a dangerous and striking departure from US policy on international humanitarian assistance which conflicts starkly with values that US administrations and the American people have embraced.""
The US decision on UNRWA was announced in mid-January after US President Donald Trump had threatened on January 2 to cut aid to Palestinians.
In a series of tweets, Trump had said: ""... We pay the Palestinians HUNDRED OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS a year and get no appreciation or respect.
""... With the Palestinians no longer willing to talk peace, why should we make any of these massive future payments to them?""

The violence has pushed more than 10,000 people into neighbouring Uganda since the beginning of December, according to the UN.
Rebecca Salama, a refugee from Congo, told Al Jazeera in Uganda's Nyakabande refugee transit camp in western Uganda that armed groups kept attacking her village, forcing her to walk into neighbouring Uganda with her husband and five children.
""When you go to pick your crops, or go to the forest for firewood, if you're a man, they kill you, and if you are a woman, they'll rape you. That is why we came here,"" she said.
Along with other new arrivals, Rebecca continued her journey in a UN truck. Everyone Al Jazeera spoke to said they did not know which armed group was attacking them, or why.
They said the fighters carried guns, wore uniforms, and spoke languages from all over Congo and neighbouring Rwanda.
At the transit camp, the refugees go through a mandatory hand and foot disinfection and a medical check.
Rebecca's baby twins, Kelvin and Kelve, were identified as seriously malnourished. She said she had not been able to harvest her crops for weeks, and so had not produced enough breast milk.
UN officials told Al Jazeera that those kinds of problems were typical among those arriving at the transit camp, before they could be assisted and taken to long-term refugee settlements.
""Most of the refugees arrive when they're very tired. Because when you talk to them they have walked for long distance,"" said Jimmy Ogwang of UN refugee agency.
""Also we have cases where women arrive and claim they have been sexually harassed or raped, by rebels or militias in DRC.""
Innocent Ndagije, Rebecca's husband, said they might never go back.
""We've heard that here is peaceful, but we're still on the way. We're optimistic that everything will be better, and not like Congo,"" he said.

""Palestinians are among those worst affected by the [Syrian] conflict,"" said UNRWA spokesperson Chris Gunness, explaining that 95 percent of 438,000 Palestinians in the war-torn country are ""in critical need of sustained humanitarian assistance"".
""The war in Syria has devastated lives with incalculable cruelty. In this situation, many of the services UNRWA provides are often literally life-saving,"" Gunness told Al Jazeera, referring to UNRWA's makeshift clinics, emergency assistance and teaching staff that educates 45,000 students a day.
Nearly 58 percent of Palestinians in Syria are internally displaced, with upwards of 56,600 trapped in hard-to-reach or inaccessible parts of the war-ravaged country, he added.
Earlier this month, the Trump administration announced that the US will indefinitely withhold $65m of its planned $125m in financial contributions to UNRWA, prompting outrage from Palestinians and humanitarian groups.
Salim Salamah, director of the Palestinian League for Human Rights - Syria, argued that Palestinian refugees in Syria and those who have been doubly displaced to neighbouring countries will suffer as a result of the decision.
""The impact is going to be really massive and tragic,"" he told Al Jazeera.
""For Palestinians of Syria, it's life-saving aid, especially in the context that many Palestinians lack access to many basic services, even [those who fled] in Lebanon or Jordan.""
Salamah added: ""It falls within the long-standing tradition of eroding the existence of Palestinians ... and it is tragic.""
Earlier this month, US Department of State spokeswoman Heather Nauert said the decision was not ""aimed at punishing anyone"".
Responding at the time, UNRWA Commissioner-General Pierre Krahenbuhl said: ""At stake is the dignity and human security of millions of Palestine refugees, in need of emergency food assistance and other support.""
The move came just weeks after Trump took to Twitter to accuse the Palestinians of showing ""no appreciation or respect"" for hundreds of millions of dollars in US aid each year.
It's not only Pakistan that we pay billions of dollars to for nothing, but also many other countries, and others. As an example, we pay the Palestinians HUNDRED OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS a year and get no appreciation or respect. They don't even want to negotiate a long overdue...
On Thursday, 21 aid groups warned of ""dire consequences"" in an open letter to US Ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, National Security Advisor HR McMaster, and Secretary of Defence James Mattis.
""We are deeply concerned by the humanitarian consequences of this decision on life-sustaining assistance to children, women and men in Jordan, Lebanon, Syria and the West Bank and Gaza Strip,"" it said.
Millions of Palestinian refugees, including those uprooted from their homes during Israel's 1948 establishment and their descendants, are spread across the map of the Middle East and elsewhere.
In Syria, however, Palestinian refugees have been caught in the crossfire of the ongoing civil war, which started as a mass uprising against President Bashar al-Assad in March 2011.
More than half-a-million Palestinians lived in refugee camps, cities and towns across Syria before the war started.
At least 125,000 of the prewar population have since fled Syria and landed in Jordan, Lebanon, Turkey, Europe and elsewhere, according to UNRWA.
Residents of many Palestinian camps, such as the Damascus-area Yarmouk camp, have suffered from air raids, shelling, siege, malnutrition, displacement and widespread destruction owing to fighting between government forces and armed groups.
On Wednesday, the Action Group for Palestinians of Syria watchdog announced that the total number of Palestinians killed in Yarmouk camp since the conflict started has reached 1,335.
Across the country, upwards of 3,642 Palestinians have died during the nearly seven years of war, while another 1,651 are believed to be detained and more than 300 are still unaccounted for, the group said.
Referring to the Trump administration's decision to pull back UNRWA funding, Salamah said: ""I don't know what is expected from us beyond accepting the horror of war, displacement and the lack of international protection.""
He concluded: ""Even our very basic livelihood is becoming a bargaining chip.""

Arthur Wagner, a leading member of the far-right party in Germany's eastern German state of Brandenburg, stepped down for ""personal reasons"", a party spokesperson confirmed, according to state broadcaster Deutsche Welle.
Wagner, who has been a member of the party since 2015, refused to comment to Tagesspiegel, the daily newspaper that first broke the news of his conversion.
""That's my private business,"" he told the daily.
On the party's Brandenburg state committee, Wagner's work focused on churches and faith communities, according to Deutsche Welle.
The AfD has campaigned against refugees and migrants and made history when it won 12.6 percent of the vote in federal elections in September 2017, entering the Bundestag for the first time.
The party became the third largest party in the Bundestag.
The news sparked derision on social media, with many Twitter users pointing to the irony of Wagner converting to Islam after being a high-ranking member of a party that has railed against the presence of Muslims in Germany.
Emily Dische-Becker said: ""Creeping Sharia picks up speed as politician from Germany's islamophobic AfD converts to Islam.""

The AfD has long denied accusations that it is Islamophobic.
Originally founded in 2013 as a Eurosceptic party, the AfD took the lead as the most aggressive anti-refugee voice in the country while nearly a million asylum seekers arrived in Germany in 2015.
In the party's first bill since its electoral success in September, the AfD proposed amending Germany's Residence Act by barring refugees from bringing their relatives from the war-ravaged countries they fled.

The party has also sought to ban the construction of mosques in Germany.
In March 2016, the party's Bavaria branch published a policy statement calling for an end to the ""construction and operation"" of mosques in the region, Deutsche Welle reported at the time.
In February of that year, then party leader Petry Frauke sparked outrage when she proclaimed that German border guards should ""use fire arms if necessary"" in order to prevent ""illegal border crossings"" by refugees and migrants.
In April 2016, the AfD's Alexander Gauland proclaimed that Germany must remain ""a Christian country"" and ""Islam is a foreign entity"".
The rise in anti-Muslim rhetoric has also coincided with a spike in violence against asylum seekers.
The German interior ministry documented 3,533 attacks on refugees and their accommodations - nearly 10 a day - in 2016.

Venezuela's constituent assembly unanimously votes to hold presidential elections by the end of April, 2018. Maduro said he is ""ready to be a candidate"" and would stand if the Socialist Party asks him.
Maduro says government wins 90 percent of mayorships. Ruling Socialist Party won at least 90 percent of the 335 mayorships contested in local elections, President Maduro said on Sunday.
Venezuelans go to the polls. On Sunday, Venezuelans will vote for the mayors of 335 municipalities.
Venezuela to launch cryptocurrency. Nicolas Maduro looked to the world of digital currency to circumvent US-led financial sanctions, announcing the launch of the ""petro"" backed by oil reserves.
""Venezuela will create a cryptocurrency,"" backed by oil, gas, gold and diamond reserves, Maduro said.
""This process is difficult, heavy, hard and full of debate and confrontation,"" said Julio Borges, president of the opposition-led congress, adding he hoped the two sides could come closer on December 15.
Five of six Citgo executives arrested on graft allegations are US citizens. All six men are being held in the headquarters of Venezuela's military counterintelligence department in Caracas.
Creditors rule Venezuela state oil firm PDVSA in default. On Thursday, a committee of creditors ruled that Venezuelan state oil company PDVSA has defaulted on its debt.
Venezuela has borrowed billions of dollars from Russia and China, primarily through oil-for-loan deals.
Ex-prosecutor wants Maduro tried at the Hague. Venezuela's former chief prosecutor on Thursday asked the International Criminal Court to capture and try President Nicolas Maduro and other top officials for crimes against humanity.
Government and opposition to resume dialogue effort. Venezuela's government and opposition will resume efforts to hold dialogue, the third attempt in a year.
Information Minister Jorge Rodriguez said on Twitter, ""the dialogue continues on November 15 in the Dominican Republic.""
New Sanctions. On Thursday the United States slapped more sanctions targeting 10 officials it said engaged in election irregularities.
EU to impose arms embargo. European Union ambassadors have agreed to ban the sale of weapons and surveillance technologies to Venezuela.
Opposition parties to boycott elections. Three of Venezuela's opposition parties: Justice First, Popular Will and Democratic Action, announced on Monday they will boycott municipal elections in December in protest against an election system they say is biased, and instead will focus on demanding reforms to the election board in anticipation of next year's presidential poll.
Venezuela, PDVSA bonds rise. Bonds issued by Venezuela and PDVSA rose in price as the state oil company began the process of making payments on the 2020 bonds, easing short-term worries about default.
Moscow to restructure Venezuela's debt. Russia said on Friday it had generally agreed with Venezuela on terms to restructure a total of $3bn of its debts to Moscow, including a postponement of debt repayment.
Venezuelan officials arrested for US probe. Spanish authorities arrested a former Venezuelan deputy minister and three former executives at Venezuelan state companies for alleged links to money laundering and international corruption, as part of a US probe, according to Spain's Civil Guard.
New governor dismissed. The newly elected opposition governor of Venezuela's western Zulia state, Juan Pablo Guanipa, was dismissed on Thursday by the local state legislature after he refused to swear loyalty to the Constituent Assembly, also known as the National Assembly.
Lima group calls for more sanction. The Lima Group, who has denounced Maduro's government, has agreed that more steps may be needed to isolate the country. Canada , a member of the group, has said if need be ""concrete steps"" can be taken to isolate the government of Venezuela from the international community and that Canada is mulling a second round of sanctions against Venezuelan officials.
Government crackdown on corruption. Orlando Chacin, a top executive at Venezuela's PDVSA, and ten other oil executives were arrested as part of the government's crackdown on corruption. The accusations include overpricing and non-execution of planned projects.
Opposition demoralised. Venezuela's young opposition supporters are demoralised by the shock election defeat they suffered this month.
Venezuelan state elections may be repeated in the five states won by the opposition if the governors-elect continue to refuse to be sworn in by the National Assembly.
Authorities have mandated that all elected governors participate in a ceremony before the pro-government Constituent Assembly, but the five opposition winners did not take part.
""Anyone who wants to be governor will have to recognise the Constituent National Assembly; otherwise elections will be repeated in states where the Assembly is not recognised,"" Maduro said.
President Donald Trump's third attempt to ban travel to the US from several countries has been blocked, hours before the executive order was to go into full effect in a number of countries, including Venezuela.
The ban would apply to members of the government, military police, intelligence services and anyone that could have been involved in human rights abuses.
The US says the sanctions are destined to hurt the government, but people in Venezuela remain defiant to the latest threat from the US.
Responding to the accusations of fraud, Maduro said on Tuesday that Venezuela's electoral process is ""the most audited and secure in the world"", adding that ""nobody can commit fraud"".
""We met [with the opposition] more than 100 times, I have the evidence,"" Maduro said.
""However the empire has given an order, not to recognise this victory ... but we will respond to this."" ""They [the opposition] do not have the capacity to make their own decisions, and we do not know who in Washington is answering to their calls,"" he added.
President Nicolas Maduro approved an audit of the ballots, and said his government had scored an ""emphatic victory"" over its rivals.
Maduro also criticised international media coverage of the election: ""I've been tuning into the BBC, CNN and others, and today's elections were completely ignored"".
""This is one of the best electoral processes, audited several times by all parties and political actors,"" said Alfredo Arevalo, the Ecuadorian representative of the Council of Electoral Experts of Latin America
President Nicolas Maduro's Socialist Party won a landslide 17 out of 23 states in Venezuela's regional elections, according to official results announced by the National Elections Council.
The opposition Democratic Union Roundtable (MUD) coalition, which earlier said the upcoming results were ""suspicious"", took only five of the states, said the council.
Venezuelans go to the ballot box on Sunday to vote in regional elections, postponed since December 2016.
The ruling Socialist Party currently controls 20 of 23 state governorships but this could be a chance for the opposition Democratic Unity coalition to score a victory, according to polls.
Two hundred voting centres have been relocated on security grounds.
Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro's approval rating rose to 23 percent in September, up 6 percentage points from 17 percent in July, according to a poll by local firm Datanalisis.
The rebound followed several rounds of sanctions by US President Donald Trump's administration as well as a sharp drop-off in four months of violent anti-government protests.
Nearly 52 percent of respondents opposed the Trump administration sanctions that came in response to the creation of a legislative super body called the Constituent Assembly.
""Negotiation is not to go and waste time, to look at someone's face, but rather so that Venezuelans can have immediate solutions,"" opposition leader Henrique Capriles told reporters.
President Donald Trump warned on Monday that Venezuela is ""collapsing"", suggesting the United States may take additional steps to restore democracy.
Trump told Latin American allies gathered on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly that President Nicolas ""Maduro defied his own people"" and was guilty of ""disastrous rule"" that may necessitate further punitive measures.
""The Venezuelan people are starving. Their country is collapsing,"" he said.
The meeting was attended by Colombia's Juan Manuel Santos, Brazil's Michel Temer, Panama's Juan Carlos Varela and Argentina's vice president Gabriela Michetti.
President Nicolas Maduro has predicted a new foreign-led effort to mediate Venezuela's political crisis would produce a deal soon, but the opposition said it would not accept another time-wasting ""show"".
Both sides sent delegations to meet the Dominican Republic's president this week for a possible start to a negotiated solution.
""After weeks of conversations, we are close to an agreement of political co-existence of peace and sovereignty,"" Maduro said in a speech on Friday. ""We're very near.""
But the opposition insisted the talks in Santo Domingo were only ""exploratory"" and said it would not proceed without firm guarantees of democratic change. They want a date for the next presidential election, due by the end of 2018, with guarantees it will be free and fair, plue freedom for hundreds of jailed activists, a foreign humanitarian corridor, and respect for the opposition-led congress.
""If we don't have iron-clad guarantees ... that everything is leading to democratic change ... we won't take a step more,"" Julio Borges, the leader of the opposition-led congress, told reporters on Saturday, recalling failed 2016 Vatican-led talks. ""We want to avoid a repeat of last year's show.""
Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro said on Tuesday his government was prepared to meet the opposition for talks, offering a glimpse of a breakthrough in a political standoff marked by months of deadly protests.
He told his ministers he would accept to undertake talks brokered by Dominican Republic President Danilo Medina and ex-Spanish premier Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero.
""Zapatero and President Medina know very well that I have been a promoter of this dialogue and I accept this new day of dialogue,"" Maduro said.
Maduro appointed influential Caracas politician Jorge Rodriguez as his representative at the talks, and said he would leave for the Dominican Republic ""in the next few hours"".
The opposition announced in turn that it would hold an exploratory meeting on Wednesday with the Dominican president. However, it insisted it did not mean it was the beginning of formal talks with the government.
The United Nations human rights chief has said that Venezuelan security forces may have committed ""crimes against humanity"" against protesters and called for an international investigation.
""My investigation suggests the possibility that crimes against humanity may have been committed, which can only be confirmed by a subsequent criminal investigation,"" Zeid Ra'ad al Hussein told the UN Human Rights Council on Monday.
But Venezuela's foreign minister defended the record of the government of President Nicolas Maduro, rejecting the allegations as ""baseless"".

Venezuela's opposition-led congress leaders met with French President Emmanuel Macron to press for humanitarian aid to thei crisis-hit nation.
""I stressed the urgency of opening up the door to humanitarian aid in Venezuela,"" congress President Julio Borges said.
The meeting with the French president took place on the first leg of a European tour seeking support against President Nicolas Maduro.
A prominent Venezuelan opposition activist has been barred from leaving the country for planned meetings with leaders of France, Germany, Spain and the United Kingdom.
Lilian Tintori on Saturday posted a photo on Twitter of herself at Caracas' international airport holding a document from migration authorities ordering the seizure of her passport before she was to board an afternoon flight.
No explanation was given, but the move came a day after she was ordered to appear before a judge on Tuesday to answer questions about the 200 million bolivars found in her car.
Venezuelan former defence minister Raul Isaias Baduel, a government critic whose whereabouts have been unknown for three weeks, is being held by the intelligence service, his family has said.
Baduel's daughter Andreina told a press conference the family were only told of his whereabouts in a phone call from new attorney general Tarek William Saab, and that she and her brother were taken to see him.
Considered by the opposition to be one of the country's most prominent political prisoners, the retired former army chief, 62, was ""wearing the same clothes"" as when he was last seen on August 8 during his transfer from a military prison outside Caracas, his daughter said.
Baduel was due to be released last March after serving a nearly eight-year sentence for corruption.
However, the prosecutor's office charged him with alleged conspiracy to oust Maduro for which he could face up to 26 years in prison.
Venezuela's all-powerful constitutional assembly has passed a decree ordering authorities to investigate and try those believed responsible for supporting new US economic sanctions.
Venezuela has kicked off two days of nationwide military drills seen as a deterrent against military intervention by the United States.
War planes, tanks, and 200,000 troops of the National Bolivarian Armed Forces (FANB) were deployed along with 700,000 reserves and civil militia members as the exercises formally launched on Saturday.
""Against the belligerent threats of the United States, all Venezuelans between the ages of 18 and 60 are required to contribute to the integral defence of the nation,"" said an announcement broadcast on state television.
The financial sanctions imposed by the US on Venezuela are the ""worst aggression to Venezuela in the last 200 years,"" Venezuela's foreign minister said on Friday after meetings at the UN.
Jorge Arreaza said it was possible the US was trying to ""promote a humanitarian crisis"" in the country.
""What do they want? Do they want to starve the Venezuelan people? What is it they are looking for? We really don't understand,"" Arreaza said.
The White House has ruled out any near-term intervention in Venezuela, two weeks after President Donald Trump raised the specter of military action in the crisis-wracked country.
""We always look at a broad range of contingencies of how this might evolve in the future,"" Trump's National Security Adviser HR McMaster said on Friday during a White House briefing.
""Any decision will be in conjunction with the partners of the region and military actions are not anticipated in the near future.""
The US has slapped sweeping financial sanctions on Venezuela, dramatically ratcheting up tensions between the two countries and making it harder for President Nicolas Maduro to raise badly needed funds to prevent a debt default.
The sanctions US President Donald Trump signed by executive order prohibit financial institutions from providing new money to the government or sate oil company PDVSA.
Venezuela's future constitution, to be written by a new assembly packed with allies of President Nicolas Maduro, will be put to a referendum, the pro-government lawmakers have announced.
The 545 members of the Constituent Assembly - which has seized power from the opposition-led legislature, and drawn international scorn - unanimously decided they would approve the text and then set a referendum date.
Venezuela's former top prosecutor, who fled to neighbouring Colombia last week, may freely enter and leave the South American country for the next six months, Bogota said, in a move likely to anger President Nicolas Maduro.
Following her removal from her post as prosecutor, she fled Venezuela for Colombia with her lawmaker husband.
US Vice President Mike Pence vowed on Wednesday that the US would not allow ""the collapse of Venezuela,"" saying such an event would ""endanger"" countries in the wider region.
""We will not stand by as Venezuela crumbles,"" Pence told a sympathetic crowd of Venezuelans in South Florida.
He also said the US will use its economic and diplomatic power to push for free elections, adding that there were more sanctions to come.
Venezuela's former chief prosecutor has resurfaced in Brazil, warning that her life remains in danger and claiming to possess ""a lot"" of proof of President Nicolas Maduro's corruption.
Speaking at a crime-fighting conference in the capital, Brasilia, Luisa Ortega said on Wednesday: ""I have received threats that there may be an attempt against my life and I hold the Venezuelan government responsible if this happens.""
President Maduro said he would seek international cooperation to arrest her.
""Venezuela is going to ask Interpol to issue a red notice against these people involved in serious crimes,"" Maduro told a news conference, referring to ex-chief prosecutor Luisa Ortega and her lawmaker husband.
Congress's declaration of resistance followed statements from a group of 12 regional nations plus the United States saying they would continue to regard congress as the Venezuela 's only legitimate lawmaking body.
Venezuela's National Assembly convened Saturday in defiance of a declaration by the new Constituent Assembly that it was seizing full powers from the opposition-led legislature.
The move Friday by the Constituent Assembly, which is loyal to socialist President Nicolas Maduro, was angrily rejected by opposition leaders and has drawn widespread international condemnation as a power grab by Maduro loyalists.
Colombian migration authorities confirmed that chief prosecutor Luisa Ortega Diaz and her husband German Ferrer landed in Bogota aboard a private plane from Aruba.
The Supreme Court ordered Ferrer's arrest on Thursday, accusing him of being part of a $6m extortion ring.
Venezuela's new legislative superbody gave itself the power to pass laws, superseding the opposition-led congress and fuelling criticism by government adversaries that socialist President Nicolas Maduro is consolidating a dictatorship.
Venezuela will hunt down and jail leaders of violent protests, its new top prosecutor said, a day before a hate crimes law is expected to be approved despite fears it will be used to crush dissent.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov stressed the need to resolve the crisis peacefully and without external intervention.
""We are united in the need to rapidly overcome the disagreements that exist in the country exclusively in a peaceful manner, through national dialogue without any kind of pressure from the outside"" Lavrov said.
Brazil's Former President Lula da Silva said on Tuesday that Maduro's actions do not justify a military intervention in the country.
""We can not allow that whatever mistake Nicolas Maduro committed or will commit, allows the US president to say he will use force to overthrow him""
""President Trump has made it very clear that we will not stand by while Venezuela collapses into a dictatorship,"" US Vice President Mike Pence told reporters in Cartagena, Colombia, according to Reuters news agency.
""A failed state in Venezuela threatens the security and prosperity of our entire hemisphere and the people of the United States of America,"" he added.
A country-wide manhunt was launched in Venezuela for the men who assaulted an army base.
Defence Minister Vladimir Padrino said in a televised address that two of the men who attacked the base had been shot dead and eight captured. About 10 others are on the run.
""This band of criminals did not act out of noble ideals or patriotic principles of any kind. They operated as mercenaries paid by extreme right-wing groups in Miami,"" he said.
Two people have been killed and at least eight others captured in an armed attack by ""terrorists"" on a Venezuelan military base, President Maduro announced on state television.
Military officials said the rebels, whom they described as ""terrorists,"" were trying to steal weapons.
Venezuelan opposition leader Leopoldo Lopez was returned to house arrest after being detained in military prison for four days, his wife Lilian Tintori said.
""They just moved Leopoldo home,"" Tintori wrote on Twitter. ""We continue with more conviction and strength for peace and freedom in Venezuela!""

Maduro, however, said that he had no intention of deviating from plans to rewrite the constitution and lashed out at US sanctions, saying the move smacked of ""imperialism"".
""They don't intimidate me. The threats and sanctions of the empire don't intimidate me for a moment,"" Maduro told a cheering audience. ""I don't listen to orders from the empire, not now or ever.""
Sanctions came as electoral authorities said more than eight million Venezuelans voted on Sunday to create a constitutional assembly - a turnout doubted by independent analysts.
The election, which spurred unrest that killed at least 10 people, was labelled illegitimate by leaders across the Americas and Europe.
Venezuela voted to select a new constitutional assembly.
In the capital, Caracas, violence has flared with police firing tear gas at protesters boycotting the vote.
At least nine people have died in election-related violence in the country.
Venezuelan President suggested talks with opposition parties before votes to elect a constituent assembly.
A national strike led by the opposition is now in its second day.
Four days before the national vote to elect a Constituent Assembly, Venezuela's opposition called on citizens to join a civic strike for 48 hours.
The strikes and march are intended to voice disapproval with President Nicolas Maduro's plan to rewrite the constitution
The government announced it will go ahead with a election of a Constituent Assembly on July 30, despite a threat of economic sanctions by US President Donald Trump .
Elections to the National Constituent Assembly is an act of political sovereignty. Nothing and nobody can stop it. The Constituent Assembly is happening"" Foreign Minister Samuel Moncada said in a speech at the foreign ministry.
Venezuela's opposition officials called for a nationwide strike against President Maduro to protest against his plan to rewrite the constitution.
The 24-hour strike was part of what the opposition called a ""final offensive"" aimed at forcing Maduro out through early elections, before his term ends in 2019.
The opposition asked voters if they support the government's plan to elect a National Constituent Assembly that will overhaul the 1999 constitution.
The plebiscite did not have the support of the electoral power nor the government, which considers it illegal.
Thousands gather in an east Caracas square on Sunday to hear opposition figures including the wife of Lopez, Lilian Tintori, speak.
At least 91 people have died in three months of street clashes between protesters and police, troops and government loyalists.
Dozens of pro-government activists have stormed the grounds of Venezuela's National Assembly and attacked politicians, leaving several injured.
""I am not going condone a circus that will stain our history with shame and pain and whose decision is foretold,"" Ortega told a news conference at the public prosecution department.
""I have committed no crime nor errors and I am not going to submit to this unconstitutional and illegitimate court,"" she added. ""We already know that today I will be removed from my post.""
The government looked for the police officer who's suspected of carrying out a helicopter attack on the Supreme Tribunal.
Venezuela's chief state prosecutor says she will defy a supreme court ruling that partially strips her of her duties.
Protesters are again on the streets demanding the resignation of President Nicolas Maduro.
Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro put the military on alert.
""I have activated the entire armed forces to defend the peace,"" Maduro said.
""Sooner or later, we are going to capture that helicopter and those that carried out this terrorist attack.""
A police helicopter dropped grenades on Venezuela's supreme court building and fired shots at the interior ministry.
President Maduro labelled this as a ""terror attack"" against his government.
Information minister Ernesto Villegas said the stolen helicopter fired 15 shots on the ministry in Caracas
In the afternoon, a video is released showing men with assault rifles flanking Oscar Perez, a former member of the forensic police force, known as the CICPC.
Movimiento Estudiantil students marched to CONATEL to deliver a document critisicing censorship in Venezuela.
The march was not impeded by authorities and they successfully delivered their statements.
Opposition politicians called for a march to protest against food shortages.
At least 63 people have been killed in street protests since April 1.
Nicolas Maduro pledged to hold a referendum on a new constitution
The move came after the plan to create a super-body known as a ""constituent assembly"" to rewrite the national charter
At an open-air rally Maduro signed a document formally establishing the terms for electing members of a ""constituent assembly""
""Votes or bullets, what do the people want?"" Maduro asked the crowd, presenting the proposed 540-member body as a way to defuse increasingly violent protests, which he says are part of a US-backed conspiracy to overthrow ""21st-century socialism"".
The March of Health occurred in Caracas with demonstrators attempting to travel to the Ministry of Health headquarters to protest against the shortages of medicine and other essential medical supplies.
Police fired tear gas to drive them back in scenes familiar after weeks of turmoil.
Government protesters marked 50 days of their demonstrations.
At least 46 people have died in clashes since the protests began.
On the 50th day of consecutive protests, millions of Venezuelans protested in Caracas during the ""We Are Millions"" march.
The United States has imposed sanctions on Venezuela's chief judge and seven other members of the country's Supreme Tribunal as punishment for seizing powers from the opposition-led congress earlier this year.
Those sanctioned had their assets frozen within US jurisdiction, and US citizens were barred from doing business with them.
At least one person died as thousands of opponents of President Nicolas Maduro staged sit-ins and roadblocks across the country in a seventh week of anti-government rallies.
The national sit-in occurs with thousands of Venezuelans blocking designated areas of trafficking for up to 12 hours.
That brought the death toll since the start of the protests to at least 39 people.
Opposition leaders called for women to march dressed in white, a traditional show of defiance, against what they brand a repressive government.
In contrast, the government announced it would be organising its own women's march in the western part of the capital, a traditional pro-Socialist stronghold.
Protesters, primarily students, marched in and around Caracas, with tear gas being used near the Central University of Venezuela.
Supporters of jailed Venezuelan opposition leader Leopoldo Lopez held a vigil outside his prison demanding to see him after rumours about his health rattled the protest-hit country.
Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro raised wages and handed out hundreds of free homes as part of efforts to counter a strengthening protest movement seeking his removal.
The announcements came as government supporters and Maduro's opponents prepared for rival marches to commemorate May Day.
Juan Pablo Pernalete, a 20-year-old student, was killed by the impact of a tear gas canister in his chest during protests in Altamira.
Following the death of the student, the son of politician Tarek Saab uploaded a video on YouTube stating that he had protested that night and that, ""That could've been me!"", and pleaded to his father saying:
""Dad, in this moment you have the power to end the injustice that has sunk this country. I ask you - as your son and in the name of Venezuela, to whom you serve - that you reflect on the situation and do what you have to do.""
Hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans participated in a silent march in memory of those killed.
For the first time, demonstrators were able to travel to western Caracas without being barricaded by authorities.
Twelve people were killed in Caracas overnight following two days of mass street protests.
The office of the Venezuelan attorney general said that eleven of those deaths were caused by electrocution and gunshot wounds in El Valle del Espiritu Santo.
The ""mother of all marches,"" as it was called by organisers, occurred.
Two Venezuelan students and one police officer died after being shot.
Later in the evening, a National Guard sergeant was killed and a colonel wounded when their squad was attacked with gunfire while trying to control disturbances in a city near Caracas.
He was the first person of authority killed in the year's protests, with the day's deaths raising the death toll of 2017 protests to at least eight people.
Venezuela's defence minister declared the army's ""unconditional loyalty"" to President Nicolas Maduro.
President Maduro ordered the expansion of the Venezuelan National Militia to involve 500,000 loyal Venezuelans.
Daniel Queliz, a 19-year-old student of the Arturo Michelena University, was shot and killed during a protest in Valencia by a Carabobo Police officer.
More than 50 individuals wounded were reported.
During the protests, 16 subway stations and 19 Caracas Metrobus routes were closed.
The Supreme Tribunal was attacked by violent protesters, burning furniture, breaking windows and damaging the front door.
Venezuelan authorities banned top opposition leader Henrique Capriles from running for office for 15 years.
""When the dictatorship squeals, it's a sign we're advancing,"" he said in a speech surrounded by other leading opposition figures, many of whom themselves have been targeted. ""The only one who is disqualified here is you, Nicolas Maduro.""
Venezuelan authorities confirmed a young man was killed during protests and vowed to investigate the death, the first since a controversy over the Supreme Tribunal blew up.
Jairo Ortiz, a 19-year-old student of the Bicentenary University of Aragua, was shot and killed while protesting in Carrizal, Miranda.
With thousands out, supporters of the 54-year-old president organised their own rally.
""They want an intervention in Venezuela,"" said Juan Aponte, 34, who wore the red colours of the governing Socialist Party.
The Venezuelan constitutional crisis began, when the immunity was taken away from opposition parliamentarians by the Supreme Tribunal.
The government assumed legislative powers of the opposition-controlled National Assembly.

But the American government was open on Tuesday morning after a three-day closure without any concrete protections for those often called ""Dreamers"".
The closure began Friday at midnight after Republicans and Democrats couldn't come to an agreement on the Deferred Action on Childhood Arrivals programme (DACA), the Obama-era policy that protected Dreamers from deportation.
President Donald Trump ended DACA in September, saying he would reinstate protections in exchange for funding for a wall on the US-Mexico border and increased militarisation of immigration enforcement authorities - two election campaign promises.
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a Democrat, agreed to pass a short-term funding bill to keep the government open until February 8 after Majority Leader Mitch McConnell promised to discuss continued protections for DACA recipients.
""We are furious to see that Democrats were the first ones to cave. We thought they had finally grown a backbone,"" Paul Quinonez, a Dreamer and activists from Washington state, told Al Jazeera. ""Instead, we saw them deliver a victory to the Republican Party in exchange for vague promises.""
Many expected Democrats to remain firm until Republicans made concessions on DACA.
The last US government shutdown occurred in 2013 when Republicans used it as a means to garner concessions on US debt and funding for former President Barack Obama's landmark healthcare legislation, popularly called Obamacare.
That shutdown lasted for two weeks as Republicans stuck to their guns, even though a majority of the US population held a negative opinion of the move.
Democrats lost control of both houses of the US Congress and the presidency in 2016, but saw surprise victories in historically Republican parts of the country in special elections in 2017, thanks to anti-Trump campaigns.
A major aspect has been to position themselves as defenders of immigrants and refugees, groups the Trump administration has targeted.
Trump and some Republicans have called the shutdown a ""failure"" for Democrats.
It seems Trump and some Dreamers agree. Democrats reopening the government with nothing more than promises from Republican leaders will cost them in upcoming midterm elections, Quinonez said.
The three-day negotiation period was a missed opportunity, wherein ""Democrats let a historic moment go to waste in exchange for more time,"" he added.
Juan Belman, an activist and organiser in Austin, Texas, a city that has seen increased raids by the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency since Trump assumed office last year, told Al Jazeera many of his friends ""have expressed their anger"" towards Democrats.
Immigrant support - especially from Latin Americans - for Democrats has been strong in recent elections. Belman explained this strategy should be reconsidered.
""Seeing how easily the Democrats were swayed clearly shows that we cannot rely on one single party to protect the immigrant community,"" Belman said.
Some Republicans have shown a willingness to pass a version of the DREAM Act. In September, shortly after Trump rescinded DACA, three Senators introduced the Succeed Act, a version more ""friendly"" to Republicans.
The Succeed Act offered a 15-year path to citizenship and featured provisions similar to those of DACA.
Other provisions blocked beneficiaries from sponsoring relatives to come to the US, which the Trump administration calls ""chain migration"" and the president is firmly against.
Still, immigrant advocates still see a possibility for a version of the DREAM Act in the near future.
""We're obviously disappointed that the negotiations didn't produce a permanent fix for Dreamers but remain optimistic,"" Robert Painter of American Gateways, an immigrant and refugee support organisation based in central Texas, told Al Jazeera.
Painter said American Gateways strongly opposes any bill that funds a border wall or blocks ""family-based"" migration, but hopes to see a DREAM Act passed in the coming weeks.
It's still possible for these protections to be renewed for the roughly 800,000 DACA recipients at least once more under a December court decision to block the end of the programme until pending cases play out in court.
The Trump administration is already appealing the decision.
American Gateways is focused on ""making sure that every client we have who is eligible to renew"" does so.
The left-leaning Center for American Progress estimates about 17,000 Dreamers have already lost protections since Trump announced the end of DACA in September, mostly because of confusion over how to renew.
Quinonez estimated a further 2,000 Dreamers will lose protection in the coming weeks, regardless of the court decision.
Without DACA protections, he expects deportations to begin soon.
""All Senators who voted to reopen the government without protections for Dreamers effectively voted to fund our deportations,"" Quinonez said.

The marches were meant to send a message to Trump after a presidential election that ""insulted, demonised and threatened"" women, immigrants and those from the LGBTQ community and others.
""[The march] will send a bold message to our new administration on their first day in office, and to the world that women's rights are human rights,"" organisers declared ahead of the 2017 women's march.
Over the last year, women have not stopped marching and organising, calling on governments to do more to support women's rights.
More women have entered politics in the US, and on Saturday and Sunday, hundreds of thousands took to the streets again to demand that they have a seat at the table.
Despite the gains, however, 2017 also saw an ""assault"" by the Trump administration and Congress on women's health, advocates and health experts say.
""We have faced assaults constantly on the legislative front to reproductive rights and to access to healthcare generally for people in America across the board,"" Amy Friedrich-Karnik, a senior policy adviser at the Center for Reproductive Rights, told Al Jazeera.
As women call on Trump to take more steps to protect women's rights, Al Jazeera examines some of the key ways activists and health experts say the administration has targeted women's health.
During his first week in office, Trump began issuing executive orders that reversed Obama-era policies. Among them was a decree that reinstated the Global Gag Rule.
The Reagan-era policy bans international organisations that receive US funding from providing abortion services or offering information about the procedure. George W Bush was the last president to reinstate the rule.
In May, the Trump administration took additional steps to expand the rule, also called the Mexico City policy, to include funding coming from the US Department of State, USAID and the Department of Defense.
This includes nearly $9bn aimed at the prevention and treatment of HIV/AIDS, malaria, the Zika virus and other health issues worldwide.
According to reproductive health advocates, the move ""severely"" restricts the work of international organisations.
""[The rule] severely limits their [NGOs] ability to take US funds and then do the work that they need to do on the ground to ensure that women have access to the healthcare they need,"" Friedrich-Karnik said.
""We know from when the Gag Rule was in place in the past that it has a really devastating effect on women's health and women's access to services,"" she added.
Amy Friedrich-Karnik, Center for Reproductive Rights
Dr Barbara Levy, vice president of health policy at the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), said that due to the wide scope of the new gag rule, many organisations that may qualify for funding are withholding services out of fear.
""What we're hearing is that organisations are refusing to do any counselling, any referrals or anything to do with even saying the word ['abortion'] because they're afraid of losing what US support and funding they have,"" Levy said.
""It [Global Gag Rule] has the potential to impact all of the good that is happened in HIV and the PEPFAR funding, [and] all of the good that has happened with malaria prevention because all of those are global health efforts, and frequently on the ground outside the US, the NGOs that are implementing these things are also doing family planning or other reproductive health services, "" she added, referring to the US President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR).
""So it has a potential to be very broadly negatively impactful, not only for women's health, but for health in general.""
Last week, the Trump administration announced that it was expanding protections for doctors, nurses and other healthcare workers who have a moral or religious objection to performing services like abortion, euthanasia or gender reassignment surgery.
The move, hailed by conservative religious groups, includes the creation of the Conscience and Religious Freedom Division within the Department of Health and Human Services to provide oversight.
""For too long too many of these healthcare practitioners have been bullied and discriminated against because of their religious beliefs and moral conviction,"" acting HHS Secretary Eric Hargan said on Thursday.
The announcement came a day before the annual March for Life, where thousands protested across the country against abortion.
Speaking to the protesters, Trump, who in the 1990s said he ""hates the concept of abortion"", but was still ""pro-choice"", boasted about his steps during his first year in office to defend the ""right to life"".
During his presidential bid, Trump said he ""evolved"" on the issue.
In October, HHS also introduced new rules that would allow companies and organisations that have moral or religious objections to file for an exemption from a federal mandate that they provide contraceptive coverage in health insurance policies without a co-pay.
In December, a second federal court blocked the move over a ""reversal"" in the Trump administration's ""approach to striking the proper balance between substantial governmental and societal interests"".
While anti-abortion rights organisations have commended Trump on the steps he has taken over the last year, reproductive rights advocates and other health experts say the new rules represent a ""deep pattern seen over the last year"".
""We believe that the primacy is not on any individuals, whether it's employers or employees or your own personal feelings,"" said Lucia DiVenere, officer of government and political affairs at ACOG.
""It's really the patient's needs,"" she told Al Jazeera.
""We over and over again implore and advise the Trump administration to put patients first and to make sure there is no political interference between patients and the care they need.
""It's really a very dystopian view of women's healthcare and their access to healthcare.""
Reproductive rights advocates also point to Trump's appointments of prominent anti-abortion rights activists to high-level posts in HHS and other departments.
Among the most controversial appointees is Charmaine Yoest, who led the leading anti-abortion rights group Americans United for Life for seven years.
Yoest serves as the assistant secretary of public affairs at HHS. She was an active supporter of the Trump campaign and has been known to cite unreliable claims regarding women's health issues.
In 2012, she told the New York Times that the scientific establishment is ""under the control of the abortion lobby"".
Republican Senator Paul Ryan congratulated Yoest on the appointment on Twitter, saying ""Yet again, this [administration] demonstrates strong commitment to the pro-life cause"".
Trump also appointed Teresa Manning to the post of head HHS's family planning programmes. Manning, who resigned last week for unknown reasons, according to local media, was openly opposed to abortion and has questioned how effective specific contraception methods are.
Many also point to the conservative appointments of Neil Gorsuch to the US Supreme Court, and the Office Refugee Resettlement's Scott Lloyd, who attempted block a 17-year-old rape survivor and other immigrant teens in federal detention from getting an abortion.
In May, Vice President Mike Pence called Trump's appointments an ""A-team"" of ""pro-life leaders"".
""For the first time in a long time, America has an administration that's filled top to bottom with people who stand without apology for life,"" Pence told a crowd at the Susan B Anthony List Campaign for Life gala.
While anti-abortion rights groups have hailed Trump's appointments, many who advocate for reproductive rights say they show a calculated move by the president to ""go after women's health rights"".
""I think it just signaled a very clear intent on the part of President Trump and his administration to systematically go after women's health, women's rights and dismantle kind of the system that we have in place to ensure that all people have access to the reproductive healthcare that they need,"" the Center for Reproductive Rights' Friedrich-Karnik said.
While Republicans, backed by Trump, have so far been unsuccessful in their multiple attempts to repeal the Affordable Care Act, commonly called 'Obamacare', women's health advocates have expressed grave concern over the implications of such a move.
""This was an incredible fight that lasted over several months and … we expect many cases that will continue this year,"" Friedrich-Karnik said.
""I think what stood out over the whole fight was that every version [of the repeal] had the same really harmful provision on women's health,"" she added.
""So a lot of the bills would roll back guarantees of coverage, which is one of the most important pieces of the Affordable Care Act was ensuring that certain types of healthcare were required to be covered, whether it was no copay contraception or whether it was maternity care.""
Versions of the bills would have also defunded Planned Parenthood for at least a year and eliminated guaranteed coverage for pre-existing conditions.
According to the Center for Reproductive Rights and ACOG, the list of ""attacks"" on women's health goes on and on.
On Friday, the administration announced it was rescinding Obama-era guidance that made it harder for states to defund Planned Parenthood. States have also introduced legislation that advocates say is aimed at restricting or eliminating abortion action.
While reproductive rights activists and advocates say they have had to go on the defensive over the last year, many still say they have hope.
""I think that it has been very heartening and probably not surprising … to see that kind of outcry that you saw over a year ago at the women's march has in no way dissipated and that anything has only strengthened,"" Friedrich-Karnik said.
""I think that you're just going to see more activism, engagement and wins for reproductive rights, for equality and justice broadly.""

In an interview from Balukhali refugee camp in Cox's Bazar, Yanghee Lee, a UN special rapporteur who was banned from visiting Myanmar, said that with Bangladesh's monsoon season approaching, the crammed camps ""will be witnessing landslides and we may see a huge number of casualties"".
Lee also warned of the possibility of an ""outbreak of diseases"" that would spread due to heavy rainfall, which may become ""impossible to contain from spreading elsewhere"".
The UN envoy was to visit Myanmar in January to assess the state of human rights across the country, including in Rakhine state, where a brutal military crackdown has sent more than 650,000 minority Rohingya fleeing into neighbouring Bangladesh.
People fleeing the violence have told of a systematic campaign of mass killings, rape and arson. The UN has described the situation as ""a textbook example of ethnic cleansing"".
Lee took up the rights monitoring role in 2014, and is required to visit Myanmar two times a year in order to report to the Human Rights Council and the UN General Assembly.
She was banned last month from conducting her investigation.
In the interview with Al Jazeera, Lee urged the international community to aid in dispersing the overcrowded camps in Bangladesh.
""The concentration of people ... it's just not human"".
As part of the repatriation deal signed by the two Asian neighbours in November last year, Bangladesh and Myanmar officials agreed last week on plans to facilitate the return, over the next two years, of those displaced.
Some 1,550 refugees will be sent back each week, which will add up to approximately 156,000 over a period of two years.
But Lee said the situation in Myanmar is not conducive for refugees to return.
""First of all, where would they go back to? They've lost their livelihood, they've lost their crops, they've lost their fields,"" she told Al Jazeera.
""All the rice now is reportedly being sold elsewhere to other countries. They've lost their homes, so the rebuilding process is going to be huge, and the people should not be subjected to living in another camp-like situation.""
She also urged that the return of any refugees to their homes be entirely voluntary, stressing there needs to be ""informed consent ... so they will know exactly what they are going back to"".
The current Rohingya crisis started in August, when Myanmar's army launched a bloody crackdown in response to attacks on border posts by the armed group, the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army.

The military said in a statement that the bodies were discovered on a people-smuggling route in the early hours of Friday after a snowstorm hit the Masnaa area, where Lebanon's largest official border crossing with Syria is located.
""The army saved six other displaced Syrians, one of whom died later in a hospital from frostbite,"" the statement added, raising the death toll to 10.
""The bodies were taken to the hospitals in the area, and the army continues to search for other displaced people trapped in the snow, in order to evacuate them and provide medical treatment for them.""

The identities of the Syrian refugees were not immediately known. According to some reports, at least one child was found among the bodies.
Two other Syrian nationals were arrested and charged with people-smuggling, the army added.
Temperatures dropped on Friday as winter storms battered the Lebanon-Syria border, making the lives of the more than 357,000 Syrian refugees living in makeshift tents in the Bekaa Valley, some 60km north of Masnaa, even more difficult.
Reporting from the region, Al Jazeera's correspondent Zeina Khodr said that Syrian refugees ""face many challenges during the winter months"".
""They live in tents that are made out of plastic sheeting, which does little to protect them from the cold and the rain,"" she said.
Hammadi Chelbi, a Syrian refugee who has been living in Bekaa Valley after he fled the Syrian conflict in its first year, told Al Jazeera that he and his family are living in misery.
""We have nothing but pain, sickness and suffering,"" he said. ""We are deprived of everything.""
There are one million registered Syrian refugees in Lebanon, although government officials estimate that the number is closer to 1.5 million.

On Thursday, the organisation said it had received a menacing phone call from Crypteia, a far-right group that attacked the home of an Afghan child last year.
""We are the group that kills, burns, hits and tortures immigrants, mainly Muslims,"" the caller said, according to Anna Stamou of the Muslim Association of Greece.
The caller contacted the organisation from a blocked number and identified himself as part of Crypteia.
He boasted of the group's attack on the home of an 11-year-old Afghan refugee, identified only as Emir in Greek media, in November.
Then, masked men had attacked the boy's home after he gained national attention for being prevented from carrying a Greek flag during a school parade. They threw beer bottles and stones at the home, shattering the windows, and left a note reading: ""Go back to your village. Leave.""
""We reported [Thursday's phone call] to officials here, then late at night we discovered that many organisations had the same threat,"" Stamou told Al Jazeera, explaining that the Greek Forum for Migrants and others received similar phone calls.
Other civil society groups, which requested anonymity, confirmed that they were among those threatened.
""We are not intimidated as groups, Muslims or anti-fascists. The whole society is being targeted by these actions,"" Stamou added. ""We don't accept threats.""
Crypteia's name is an apparent reference to a group of ancient Spartans who were notorious for attacking slaves. The vigilante outfit is believed to have stemmed from the neo-fascist Golden Dawn party, which has 16 seats in the Greek parliament.
Greek police were not immediately available for comment.
There are around 200,000 Muslims in Athens, according to the Muslim Association of Greece, a civil society group advocating for indigenous Muslims, Greek converts, refugees, migrants and others.
In 2010, the Pew Research Center said there were 500,000 Muslims in the country, but this number has increased with refugees and migrants, most of whom come from Muslim-majority countries.
Tina Stavrinaki, legal officer at the Racist Violence Recording Network, said it was clear that ""Muslims are the target"".
""They said the same thing [to all the groups threatened],"" she told Al Jazeera.
""They said they take responsibility for attacks against migrants almost everywhere.""
Racist violence is rising in Greece, targeting migrant labourers in neighbourhoods in Piraeus, a port city near Athens.
Between December 25 and January 5, the anti-racist activist group Keerfa recorded attacks on the homes of more than 30 migrant labourers, mostly Pakistanis, in Renti and Nikaia, two neighbourhoods in Piraeus.
While 48 hate crimes motivated by race, skin colour or national origin took place in Greece in 2016, 47 incidents were recorded during the first six months of last year alone, according to police statistics provided to Al Jazeera.
Although Golden Dawn has a long history of attacks on immigrants and political opponents, it has scaled back its violence in recent years.
That decline has coincided with the Golden Dawn's ongoing trial, which saw 69 of its members arrested and charged with running a criminal organisation after one of the party's members murdered anti-fascist rapper Pavlos Fyssas in September 2013.
Most of those threatened by Crypteia are witnesses in the Golden Dawn trial, Stamou said.
""This is a hate crime,"" she said.
The Muslim Association of Greece has had pigs' heads thrown at its office entrance in recent years and been mailed threatening letters.
""We will chop you up like chickens,"" one of the notes read.
""This is their routine,"" Stamou said. ""We are not surprised.""

Deputy Prime Minister Alexander De Croo said in a statement on Wednesday that Brussels would allocate the funds over three years.
The first annual payment is being disbursed immediately ""considering the financial difficulties that UNRWA currently faces"", the statement said.
Washington announced on Tuesday it is withholding $65m out of the $125m aid package earmarked for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian Refugees, or UNRWA.
De Croo said the Belgian government stepped up in response to the urgent call for help by the commissioner-general of UNRWA, an agency that provides humanitarian help to millions of Palestinian refugees.
""I have a lot of respect for UNRWA's work, which has to operate in the most difficult and dangerous circumstances,” De Croo said in his statement.
""Living conditions in Gaza, Syria, the West Bank and elsewhere in the region are particularly tough,” he added.
""For a lot of Palestinian refugees the UNRWA is the last life buoy. With the help of UNRWA half a million of Palestine children are able to go to school. This prevents them from falling prey to radicalisation and extreme violence.""
The US announcement on UNRWA's funding came after US President Donald Trump had threatened on January 2 to cut aid to Palestinians.
In a series of tweets, Trump had said: ""... We pay the Palestinians HUNDRED OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS a year and get no appreciation or respect.
""... With the Palestinians no longer willing to talk peace, why should we make any of these massive future payments to them?""
It's not only Pakistan that we pay billions of dollars to for nothing, but also many other countries, and others. As an example, we pay the Palestinians HUNDRED OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS a year and get no appreciation or respect. They don’t even want to negotiate a long overdue...
International NGOs sharply condemned the funding cut.
Kenneth Roth, executive director of Human Rights Watch, said in a Twitter post on Tuesday that Washington was ""holding Palestinian kids' humanitarian needs hostage to political agendas"".
Jan Egeland, secretary-general of the Norwegian Refugee Council, urged the US government to reverse its decision
Belgium, together with other EU member states, is now UNRWA's largest donor.
In the coming years, ""Belgium, along with the EU and countries from the region, will continue to support UNRWA and the Palestinian refugees"", De Croo's statement said.
Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas is set to visit Brussels next Monday to exchange thoughts about Belgian's support.
UNRWA was established in 1949 in order to provide assistance to Palestinian refugees, who in the aftermath of the 1948 Arab-Israeli War numbered about 700,000.
The agency now offers support to approximately five million Palestinians in education, healthcare and housing, and is active in Palestinian occupied territories, Syria, Lebanon and Jordan.

""It will also deny their parents a social safety net that helps them to survive, and undermine the UN agency's ability to respond in the event of another flare-up in the [Israeli-Palestinian] conflict.""
Jan Egeland - Norwegian Refugee Council
On Twitter, Egeland said: ""Cutting aid to innocent refugee children due to political disagreements among well-fed grown men and women is a really bad politization of humanitarian aid. US holds back $65m aid to Palestinians.""
The Turkish Mnistry of Foreign Affairs said cuts to UNRWA would ""hamper the efforts towards a two-state political solution and regional stability"". It also said that Ankara would increase its contributions to the agency.
Yazan Muhammad Sabri, an 18-year-old Palestinian refugee in Dheisheh camp in the occupied West Bank town of Bethlehem, told Al Jazeera last week that ""if the wakala [UNRWA] goes away, there will be no education, no healthcare, no sanitation"".
""There will be nothing - everything will disappear,"" he said.
Salah Ajarmeh, a 44-year-old refugee living in West Bank's Aida camp, told Al Jazeera that ""if the services stop, there will be a revolution"".
""Palestinian uprisings began in the refugee camps in Jordan and Syria, and this will happen again.""
Husam Zomlot, head of the Palestine Liberation Organisation's delegation to the US, said in a statement on Wednesday that Palestinian refugees and children's access to basic humanitarian services was ""not a bargaining chip but a US and international obligation"".
""Taking away food and education from vulnerable refugees does not bring a lasting and comprehensive peace,"" the statement said.
""Heeding Israeli Prime Minister [Benjamin] Netanyahu's zero-sum game to take Jerusalem off the table and now attempting to dismantle UNRWA, thinking that it would relinquish the rights of Palestinian refugees is a fallacy.""
Zomlot was referring to the earlier US decision to recognise Jerusalem as Israel's capital, a move that prompted widespread international condemnation and led Palestinian leaders to say that they would ""no longer"" accept any peace plan put forward by the US.
Tuesday's announcement on UNRWA came after US President Donald Trump had threatened on January 2 to cut aid to Palestinians.
In a series of tweets, Trump had said: ""... We pay the Palestinians HUNDRED OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS a year and get no appreciation or respect.

In a letter, the department said that additional US donations would be contingent on major changes by UNRWA.
Those funds are ""frozen for future consideration"", Heather Nauert, State Department spokeswoman, told reporters.
For nearly 70 years, UNRWA has been the lifeline to the more than five million registered Palestinian refugees in the occupied territories and Lebanon, Jordan and Syria.
It offers support in food supply, access to education, healthcare, social services and employment.
""This is going to be a big blow,"" Al Jazeera's James Bays, reporting from the UN headquarters in New York, said of the move by the US, which is UNRWA's largest donor supplying almost 30 percent of its budget.

The posts came less than a month after his controversial decision to recognise Jerusalem as Israel's capital, a move that prompted widespread international condemnation and led Palestinian leaders to say that they would ""no longer"" accept any peace plan put forward by the United States.
Following the US threats to cut aid, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called for UNRWA to be scrapped and accused the agency of helping ""fictitious refugees"".
Antonio Guterres, the UN secretary-general, said on Tuesday he had not been informed of Washington's decision.
""First of all, UNRWA is not a Palestinian institution, UNRWA is a UN institution,"" Guterres said, expressing his deep ""concern"" about the move. If the agency is not in a position to provide ""vital services"" and emergency support it will create a ""very very serious problem,"" he told reporters.
""In my opinion, and an opinion that is shared by most international observers, including some Israeli ones, it [UNRWA] is an important factor of stability.""
Hanan Ashrawi, a senior member of the Palestine Liberation Organization, said the US seemed to be following the Israeli government's ""instructions to gradually dismantle the one agency that was established by the international community to protect the rights of the Palestinian refugees and provide them with essential services.""
She said in a statement that Trump's administration was ""targeting the most vulnerable segment of the Palestinian people and depriving the refugees of the right to education, health, shelter and a dignified life"", warning that the US was ""creating conditions that will generate further instability throughout the region"".
Al Jazeera's Bays said there was also ""a political dimension"" to the US move.
""Trump has said he is going to try and come up with the 'deal of the century' between Israelis and Palestinians - and yet he has now recognised Jerusalem as Israel's capital and cut the funding to UNRWA,"" said Bays.
""One of the sides feels very strongly now that he is not an honest broker.""
Trump's threat had cast doubt on the fate of millions of Palestinian refugees, with many expressing fear about the impact of such a move.

The notification for the ban has been posted online by the education bureau, as authorities step up their suppression of religious freedoms.
School students in Linxia county in Gansu province, home to many members of the Muslim Hui ethnic minority, are prohibited from entering religious buildings over their break, a district education bureau said, according to the notification.
Students must also not read scriptures in classes or in religious buildings, the bureau said, adding that all students and teachers should heed the notice and work to strengthen political ideology and propaganda. China is an atheist, communist state.
Reuters was unable to independently verify the authenticity of the notice.
The Linxia education bureau has declined to comment on the document's validity.
Xi Wuyi, a Marxist scholar at the state-backed Chinese Academy of Social Sciences and an outspoken critic of rising Islamic influence in China, shared the picture and welcomed the apparent move by the authorities.
With the notice, the county was taking concrete action to keep religion and education separate, and sticking strictly to education law, she said on the Weibo social media platform.
New regulations on religious affairs released in October last year, and due to take effect in February, aim to increase oversight of religious education and limit religious activities.
Last summer, a Sunday School ban was introduced in the southeastern city of Wenzhou, sometimes known as ""China's Jerusalem"" due to its large Christian population, but Christian parents found ways to teach their children about their religion, regardless.
Chinese law formally grants religious freedom for all, but regulations on education and protection of minors also say religion cannot be used to hinder state education, or children taught to believe in a religion, rather than communism.
Authorities in troubled parts of China, such as the far western region of Xinjiang, home to the Turkic-speaking Uighur Muslim minority, ban children from attending religious events.
But religious communities elsewhere rarely face blanket restrictions.
Fear of Muslim influence has grown in China in recent years, sparked in part by violence in Xinjiang.
The Chinese-speaking Hui, who are culturally more similar to the Han Chinese majority than to Uighurs, have also come under scrutiny from some intellectuals, who fear creeping Islamic influence on society.

Two bodies were also recovered.
Vessels belonging to the Italian coastguard and finance police, the European Union anti-smuggling operation, Sophia, and ships run by humanitarian groups took part in 11 rescue operations, a statement said.
No details about the nationalities of those rescued were given, nor was there further information about the deaths.
Though hundreds of thousands of refugees have reached Europe via Italy, after setting off in boats from North Africa over the past four years, it is unusual to see so many rescued on a single day during the winter, when the seas tend to be rough.
So far this year, 974 refugees had reached Italy by sea, down from 2,393 during the same period last year, the Interior Ministry said earlier on Tuesday before the latest rescues.
Immigration and the intake of refugees is one of the hot-button issues before a national election on March 4. The ruling Democratic Party has pointed to a sharp fall in arrivals from Libya, since July, as proof that it is now managing what had seemed like an endless flow of refugee boats.
Arrivals fell by a third last year to 119,000 compared with a year earlier, and they tumbled by two-thirds in the second half of the year. The declines came after a deal with the Tripoli government sealed in February, which foresaw aid and training for the Libyans to fight people-smuggling and to bolster their coastguard.
More than 20,000 refugees are estimated to have died attempting the crossing to Italy in the past four years, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) estimates, making it the deadliest border for refugees in the world.
The Italian Northern League party, a member of the centre-right coalition leading in polls before the vote, on Monday vowed to stop the ""migrant invasion"".

Why did the US leave the Paris Agreement?
Who has Trump appointed to the climate file?
Do Trump's policies have popular support?
How have local officials responded?
Last week, a group of more than 100 members of Congress sent a letter to Donald Trump, calling on the US president to reconsider his decision to remove the threat of climate change from his National Security Strategy.
""We have heard from scientists, military leaders and civilian personnel who believe that climate change is indeed a direct threat to America's national security and to the stability of the world at large,"" the letter read.
Trump announced his National Security Strategy at the end of last year, dropping climate change from its list of global threats.
The move, the politicians said, ""represents a step backwards on this issue and discredits those who deal in scientific fact"".
Trump's predecessor, Barack Obama, added climate change to the list of threats in 2015, saying it was an ""urgent and growing threat ... contributing to increased natural disasters, refugee flows, and conflicts over basic resources like food and water"".
Trump's reversal of the Obama-era stance comes at a time when city and state officials in the US move, without the president, to address climate change and its threats.
Just before Trump announced his National Security Strategy in December, city officials from the US and around the world met in Chicago to outline a collective plan to combat climate change at the local level, an effort they say is ""more ambitious"" than their respective national governments.
The North American Climate Summit brought together city and other local leaders who have signed onto a plan to combat climate change, known as the Global Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy.
Nearly 7,500 localities, representing more than 680 million people around the world, have committed to the plan, according to organisers.
Among other goals, the covenant aims to reduce carbon emissions to meet the aims of the Paris Agreement, the international accord that seeks to reduce global carbon emissions and keep the world's temperature below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.
The deal entered into force in November of last year, and 170 states have ratified it to date.
""Across the world, cities have made voluntary commitments to take significant action on climate change that are in line with, and in many cases more ambitious than, their respective national government baselines,"" the Global Covenant said in a statement.
But, as local leaders move forward in their fight against climate change, many climate experts and analysts, as well as politicians, say the US president is taking steps to reverse any progress.
President Donald Trump has attempted to roll back environmental protection measures and commitments to fight climate change that were made under previous US administrations
Al Jazeera examines the Trump administration's environmental policies, what appointments the president has made on the environmental file, and how local and state-level governments across the US have responded.
Since taking office, Trump has systematically undone many existing climate and environmental safeguards, as well as policies pursued by his predecessor, Barack Obama.
The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has moved, under Trump, to repeal a plan to curb greenhouse gas emissions from power plants. Passed under the Obama administration, the Clean Power Plan (CPP) sought to reduce emissions to 32 percent below 2005 levels by the year 2030.
The Trump EPA has argued the CPP ""is not consistent with the Clean Air Act"" - a federal law to protect air quality and reduce air pollution across the country - but that claim has been challenged by environmental experts.
The government also says a repeal would take ""another step to advance President Trump's America First strategy"".
The administration justified the decision by saying it is working to fulfil a campaign promise to bring coal mining jobs back to struggling communities across the country.
The move was welcomed by coal mining companies and some coal miners, who attended a public hearing on the proposed repeal in West Virginia in November.
Robert Murray, CEO of private coal mining company Murray Energy, referred to the rules as the ""no power plan"", Reuters news agency reported. Murray, whose company had filed a lawsuit against the CPP, was accompanied by 20 miners from Pennsylvania and West Virginia at the hearing.
Reuters also reported that Scott Segal, head of the Electric Reliability Coordinating Council, said the CPP is expensive and illegal because it requires some utilities to reduce emissions far away from the power plants themselves.
Despite Trump's promises to ""bring back coal"", production levels and new jobs in the industry only slightly increased, according to local media.
And analysts and climate activists believe the Trump's position on CPP moves the US in the wrong direction.
It's an ""attack on the very air we breathe, the water we drink, and the land on which we stand"", Nanette Diaz Barragan, a Democratic representative from California, said in a statement in March.
Meanwhile, the Trump administration dropped a proposal to limit the number of endangered whales, dolphins and sea turtles that can be killed by fishing nets off the West Coast. Its EPA dismissed several members of an advisory board that is tasked with verifying its scientists' research, and has proposed cutting the EPA's overall budget by about 30 percent.
In March, Trump signed a presidential permit to begin construction on the Keystone XL pipeline, reversing a decision made by the Obama administration to abandon the multi-billion-dollar project after an environmental assessment.
Despite major concerns from environmental groups and indigenous and other local communities about the potential of a devastating oil spill, Trump said the pipeline - which will pump tar sands oil from Canada through several US states - would create jobs and stimulate the US economy.
In October, the president announced he would open up bids to lease almost 77 million acres (about 31 million hectares) in the Gulf of Mexico for oil and gas drilling.
The sale, which is expected in March, would be the largest offering in US history, and ""open an area the size of New Mexico to drilling"", according to Fortune magazine.
In December, the Trump EPA also dropped a requirement that forced mining companies to prove they have the financial means to clean up any pollution they cause, the Associated Press reported. The decision came amid pushback from mining groups and Republicans in the western US, the news agency said.
The National Mining Association, a mining advocacy group, welcomed the decision.
""When litigation is used as a tool to attempt to force the government into unnecessary action against an industry, the result is bad policy,"" said Hal Quinn, the group's president and CEO, in a statement.
""Today's action shows that reason can prevail,"" Quinn said.
The EPA justified the move by saying the requirement was ""unnecessary"" and that it imposed an undue burden on the US economy and rural parts of the country where most mining jobs are located.
But among Trump's many policy changes, his withdrawal from the Paris Agreement last year may be the most controversial and most widely condemned, both in the US and internationally.
In line with his administration's ""America First"" mantra, Trump has argued the agreement undermines the US economy and the country's sovereignty. But the president has said he would be open to renegotiating ""a deal that's fair"" to US interests.
The withdrawal process will take until November 2020 to complete.
When he announced the withdrawal, Trump said, ""the same nations asking us to stay in the agreement are the countries that have collectively cost America trillions of dollars through tough trade practices and, in many cases, lax contributions to our critical military alliance.
""I was elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris,"" he said.
However, the mayor of Pittsburgh, Bill Peduto, said his city would continue to follow the guidelines set out by the accord.
As the Mayor of Pittsburgh, I can assure you that we will follow the guidelines of the Paris Agreement for our people, our economy & future. https://t.co/3znXGTcd8C
Experts have warned that, as the world's second-largest carbon emitter behind only China, the US' decision to withdraw from the agreement may weaken global efforts to control climate change. US emission cuts alone accounted for 20 percent of the deal, according to a report by the Council on Foreign Relations.
""The United States' European allies have lobbied hard against a US exit from the deal, arguing that it would weaken its enforcement measures and undermine the resolve of other countries to make their own tough cuts,"" the report stated.
In January, Trump said the US could ""conceivably"" return to the accord if the agreement was amended to be more in line with US interests.
""It's an agreement that I have no problem with, but I had a problem with the agreement that they [Obama's administration] signed because, as usual, they made a bad deal,"" Trump said.
The president appointed Scott Pruitt to lead the EPA, the organisation that is tasked with protecting the health of US citizens and the environment.
Pruitt is a longtime recipient of donations from oil and gas companies, and, as the former attorney general of Oklahoma, Pruitt sued the agency he now heads 14 times, according to EDF Action, an advocacy group allied with the Environmental Defense Fund.
Among those lawsuits, Pruitt challenged an EPA measure that would have curbed mercury and toxic air pollution from power plants, and another EPA guideline that sought to limit pollution from new, modified or reconstructed oil and gas facilities, EDF Action outlined.
Pruitt is also a climate change denier who has repeatedly questioned whether human activity is responsible for climate change.
""Science tells us that the climate is changing and that human activity in some manner impacts that change. The ability to measure with precision the degree and extent of that impact and what to do about it are subject to continuing debate and dialogue. And well it should be,"" Pruitt said, before his appointment as the new EPA Administrator.
But 97 percent of climate scientists agree that ""climate-warming trends over the past century are extremely likely due to human activities"", and experts have slammed Pruitt's comments.
Mr Pruitt has claimed that carbon dioxide caused by human activity is not 'the primary contributor to the global warming that we see.' Mr Pruitt is wrong. - Ben Santer, climate researcher at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory
""The scientific community has studied this issue for decades. The consensus message from many national and international assessments of the science is pretty simple: Natural factors can't explain the size or patterns of observed warming,"" Ben Santer, climate researcher at the Lawrence Livermore Laboratory, said in a statement.
""A large human influence on global climate is the best explanation for the warming we've measured and monitored,"" Santer said.
Dr Kevin Trenberth, a distinguished senior scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research, added in a statement that ""Pruitt has demonstrated that he is unqualified to run the EPA or any agency.
""There is no doubt whatsoever that the planet is warming and it is primarily due to increased carbon dioxide in the atmosphere from burning of fossil fuels,"" he said.
A recent report by a non-profit coalition of researchers and other academics found that climate change web content is being censored by the Trump administration.
""Although there is no evidence of any removals of climate data, we have documented overhauls and removals of documents, web pages and entire websites, as well as significant language shifts,"" the Environmental Data Governance Initiative said in its January report.
The report highlighted that the ""EPA's removal and subsequent ongoing overhaul of its climate change website raises strong concerns about loss of access to valuable information for state, local and tribal governments, and for educators, policymakers and the general public"".
It added: ""While we cannot determine the reasons for these changes from monitoring websites alone, our work reveals shifts in stated priorities and governance and an overall reduction in access to climate change information, particularly at the EPA.""
Nearly 70 percent of people across every US state said the country should participate in the Paris Agreement, according to a study released by the Program on Climate Change Communication at Yale University in May.
Nearly half of all Trump voters (47 percent) said the US should stay in the agreement, the same study found, compared with only 28 percent of Trump voters who said the US should not participate.
Another survey published in October by the same Yale University programme found that a majority of US citizens would be willing to pay a carbon tax on fossil fuels and would support investing that tax revenue into renewable energy.
The Trump administration has claimed its policies have broad support in Appalachia, the central part of the country that is home to most coal mining and other traditional industries that leave a larger carbon footprint.
Mining industry lobby groups and companies have welcomed some of the president's recent actions, including the repeal of regulations on the coal industry.
""A strong energy industry is a goal that will benefit all Americans and is achievable without diminishing the significant environmental protections that Americans rightfully expect,"" said Quinn of the National Mining Association in a recent statement.
However, Bill Price, an organiser with the Sierra Club in West Virginia, recently told Al Jazeera that local communities were ready to move away from coal and other dirty industries. Many people are realising the economic benefits of moving away from coal and towards more sustainable sources of energy, he said.
""The coal miners that I talk to in the community are more and more understanding that they need to be looking at a transition,"" Price said.
""They need investment from the federal government and the state government in that transition, and they understand that their industry is dying and not much can be done to revive it.""
According to May 2016 data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, coal mining accounted for 53,420 total jobs in the US. That figure includes managerial and human resource jobs, as well as engineers, extraction workers and mining machine operators.
Since the Trump administration pulled out of the Paris Agreement, 385 US mayors - from cities across the country including Albany, New York, Houston, Texas, and Sacramento, California - have committed to the climate plan.
More than 2,500 city, state, business and university leaders from all 50 states have also signed on to the We Are Still In pledge to demonstrate an ""enduring commitment to tackling climate change, ensuring a clean energy future, and upholding the Paris Agreement"".
Additionally, dozens of governors, members of US Congress and other officials from across the US have and continue to speak out against the administration's environmental policies.
Christiana Figueres, vice-chair of the Global Covenant of Mayors, said December's summit in Chicago is an opportunity to continue acting on the political will to tackle environmental issues and show ""that local action is being taken to fulfil commitments"".
Barack Obama also addressed the meeting, saying it was ""an unusual time where the United States is now the only nation on Earth that does not belong to the Paris Agreement, and that's a difficult position to defend.
""Now, the good news is that the Paris Agreement was never going to solve the climate crisis on its own. It was going to be all of us. Cities and states and businesses and universities and nonprofits have emerged as the new face of American leadership on climate change,"" the former president said.
Attorney General for New York, Eric Schneiderman, is leading a coalition of his counterparts and other legal officers from 23 US states, cities and counties against the repeal of the Clean Power Plan.
""We won't hesitate to protect those we serve,"" Schneiderman said in a statement, ""including by aggressively opposing in court President Trump's actions that ignore both the law and the critical importance of confronting the very real threat of climate change.""

As part of a repatriation deal signed by the two Asian neighbours in November last year, Bangladesh and Myanmar officials at a joint meeting in Naypyidaw on Tuesday agreed on plans to facilitate the return of those displaced since August.
""Much work remains to be done in the context of the Rohingya refugee situation to ensure that any potential returns are voluntary, that they occur in conditions of safety and dignity, and that they are sustainable,"" said Caroline Gluck, senior public information officer for UNHCR, the UN refugee agency.
""The protection of the Rohingya refugees must be guaranteed both in Bangladesh and upon their return to Myanmar,"" she told Al Jazeera in an emailed response.
Earlier, Bangladesh's foreign ministry said in a statement that ""the repatriation would be completed preferably within two years from its commencement"".
""There will be two working groups - one will work on verification process for Rohingya, and the other will facilitate the return of verified refugees to Myanmar,"" an official in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, who preferred to remain unnamed, said.
When asked whether the verification process is different from the one outlined in 1992 when a similar crisis had led to another deal being agreed upon, the ministry official declined to clarify, saying the foreign secretary will clarify the issue later.
Under the arrangement, Bangladesh would possibly establish five transit camps from where returnees would be received initially in two reception centres on the Myanmar side, the statement revealed.
Some 1,550 refugees will be sent back each week, which will add up to approximately 156,000 over a period of two years.
""Myanmar has reiterated its commitment to stop the outflow of Myanmar residents to Bangladesh,"" the Bangladesh foreign ministry said.
The agreement does not specify when repatriation will commence but outlines providing temporary shelter to returning Rohingya and building houses for them later.
More than 650,000 Rohingya have fled to neighbouring Bangladesh since August 25, when Myanmar's army launched a bloody crackdown in response to attacks on border posts by the armed group, Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army.
Refugees who crossed the border reported mass killings, gang rapes and arson, prompting the UN and rights groups to accuse Myanmar's army of possible crimes against humanity.
The mainly Muslim minority, who live primarily in Rakhine State, is not recognised as an ethnic group in Myanmar, despite having lived there for generations. They have been denied citizenship and are rendered stateless.
Many refugees living in camps in Bangladesh have also raised fears about returning to Myanmar.
Abd-us-Salam, who is more than 100 years old, has fled three military crackdowns in Myanmar. He and his wife are currently seeking refuge in Bangladesh's Kutupalong refugee camp.
""There's no point in sending us back to Myanmar because there is no security for us there,"" he told Al Jazeera.
""They will not allow a single Rohingya to live there,"" he said.
""They will slaughter us all. Please don’t send us back as bait for the monster.""
Taslima Begum, another Rohingya refugee, said she would ""rather die in Bangladesh than go back"".
""We have been persecuted and brutalised there,"" she said. ""They took all our possessions, crops and cattle.""
UNHCR's Gluck told Al Jazeera that Rohingya refugees said they would only consider returning if they saw positive developments in relation to their legal status and citizenship, the security situation in Rakhine State and their ability to enjoy basic rights back home.
She said that the causes of the crisis, such as the Rohingya's legal and citizenship status, need to be addressed to ensure peace and security in Rakhine State.
Since the signing of the deal, the UN and rights groups have criticised the repatriation plan, because they believe it does not guarantee the protection of the refugees on return.
Delwar Hossain, director of East Asian Study Centre of Dhaka University, told Al Jazeera on Tuesday that it would be impossible to complete the repatriation process within two years.
""I am sceptical whether they will be able to start the repatriation properly with the Physical Arrangement that was signed between the two countries,"" he said.
The UN has called the violence against civilians in Myanmar a ""textbook example of ethnic cleansing"".
The ongoing crisis has been described as the biggest forced exodus of 2017.

The site was reportedly manufacturing Captagon, an amphetamine-based drug that is one of the most popular narcotics in the Middle East, including among fighters in Syria's long-running conflict.
The anti-narcotics department (AND) said on Tuesday that it had confiscated several tonnes of enough material to make more than 100 million pills.
According to the official news agency, Petra, it was the first raid of its kind in Jordan, and eight people in total were arrested.
The main suspect was arrested at the facility, after the AND had worked for months pursuing information based on a tip-off.
The AND had gathered information about the suspect who had imported chemicals used to manufacture detergents.
In a statement, the Department of Public Relations and Information (DPS) said that the suspect had sought the help from foreign nationals to process the chemicals and extract elements to produce pills of Captagon, a psychostimulant.
On the same day, another AND team raided an apartment in Amman that was used as storage for the drugs and found two million Captagon pills there. Another suspect present at the scene was also arrested.
Six other people who had planned to smuggle the drugs outside the country were arrested elsewhere, the DPS said, and the investigation is still ongoing.
Captagon has been the drug of choice for many fighters in the Syrian conflict.
In November 2015, 11 million pills were seized by Turkish officials at the Syria-Turkey border.
The drug can be bought cheaply at $2, and Syrians in refugee camps in Lebanon are increasingly turning to using it, Ramzi Haddad, a Lebanese psychiatrist and cofounder of an addiction centre called Skoun, had previously told Al Jazeera.
""In the short term it makes people feel euphoric and fearless and makes them sleep less - perfect for wartime fighting, but in the long term it brings on psychosis, paranoia and cardiovascular side effects,"" added Haddad.

Ahmad Salim, 24, was hit by Israeli fire on Monday after clashes erupted in the town of Jayous, east of Qalqilyah, Palestinian news agency Wafa reported.
He was transferred to Qalqilyah's Darwish Nazzal hospital with a head wound and was pronounced dead shortly afterwards, added Wafa, citing the Palestinian health ministry.
No other information was immediately available.
Salim is the fourth Palestinian to have been killed by Israeli forces in 2018.
The other three are 17-year-old Musab Firas al-Tamimi, from the village of Deir Nitham, and two other teenagers, killed east of the Gaza Strip's Bureij refugee camp and the West Bank village of Iraq Burin, respectively.
Tensions in the region have increased in recent weeks after US President Donald Trump's controversial decision to name Jerusalem as Israel's capital.
The December 6 move prompted deadly protests in the occupied Palestinian territories and mass rallies in solidarity with the Palestinians across the Muslim world.
It was also met with widespread international condemnation, including by many US allies.

Established in 2015, Baobab Experience is now located in a car park surrounded by deserted buildings in the Italian capital. More than 20 evictions have forced the centre to move several times.
When Ali decided to quit Khartoum, the Sudanese capital, for Europe, he was 15 years old. His hopes to study and find work, however, were put on hold when he was trapped in Libya for two years.
With the sun dipping below the horizon, Ali recalls finally arriving on Italy's southern shores a month ago.
The teenager says he has already attempted crossing into France.
""We don't want to stay in Italy,"" he tells Al Jazeera, his reed-thin arms crossed on his lap. ""Even people with [legal] papers here end up sleeping in the streets with us.
""They returned us to southern Italy, and we came all the way back here.""
Although few refugees and migrants seek to remain in Italy, where job opportunities are scarce, the far right has seized on increasing frustration among many Italians and pushed a nativist programme.
With the general election coming up in March, observers warn that anti-migration rhetoric has been mainstreamed, bolstering far-right organisations such as CasaPound and Forza Nuova - parties that once occupied the political fringes.
""They want to keep everyone separate by ethnicity,"" says Guido Caldiron, a Rome-based journalist and author of Extreme Right, a book about far-right and neo-fascist movements.
While the two groups are not expected to break the three-percent threshold to enter parliament, Caldiron argues that their anti-migrant crusades may have boosted their future chances in local and regional elections.
""They exploit the crisis to get consensus in certain areas by leading revolts against the presence of immigrants,"" he says, likening the groups' tactics to that of Golden Dawn, a neo-fascist party with a long history of political violence in nearby Greece.
""They go against the migrants … and then claim they were protecting [Italians] from an invasion of immigrants.""
In November, CasaPound employed ultra-nationalist and anti-migrant rhetoric to capture nine percent in municipal elections in Ostia, a seaside neighbourhood on Rome's outskirts.
Simone Di Stefano, CasaPound's candidate for prime minister in the upcoming elections, claims that that ""problems come from too many immigrants being present… and there is a feeling that immigrants are preferred by the state over Italians"".
""Of course, new arrivals have to be stopped, but fake refugees should be sent back. They cannot find a job [and] a house, here [in Italy],"" Di Stefano tells Al Jazeera. ""It doesn't make sense for them to stay because they're not entitled to be here.""
CasaPound has staged anti-migrant protests in cities and towns across the country.
Last year, the fascist party sparked outrage when it plastered thousands of anti-migrant posters on the walls of several cities, among them Rome, Milan and Venice.
In October, Forza Nuova fuelled swelling xenophobia when it hung up posters of a black man ostensibly abusing a white woman.
""Protect her from the invaders,"" the propaganda read. ""It could be your mother, wife, sister, daughter.""
Yet, anti-migrant themes are far from being limited to CasaPound and Forza Nuova.
During the 2013 general election, the mainstream right-wing League (also known as the Northern League) secured 13 seats in the Chamber of Deputies and 20 in the Senate.
In December last year, party leader Matteo Salvini told an election rally that if he won the upcoming vote, his government would provide many refugees and migrants with ""a one-way ticket to send them back"".
The current government, under the leadership of former centre-left Prime Minister Matteo Renzi's Democratic Party, has also contributed to an increasingly hostile environment for refugees and migrants.
During his first eight months in office, Marco Minniti, the Italian interior minister, has overseen policies that led to an 87 percent decrease in arrivals.
As a result of moves by Italian and European Union officials, some 18,000 refugees and migrants were trapped in Libya, a war-torn country where many have been forced into open slave markets and where torture has become widespread.
Back in Baobab Experience, nightfall comes, and the camp swells with people coming for a hot meal and a place to sleep without harassment by authorities.
Around 125 people are in the camp in winter; volunteers and activists say that number often tops 500 in warmer weather.
Flames dance from the smouldering wood on the ground in front of a zigzag of tents, many of them dimly lit by mobile phones inside, others dark and quiet.
Inside a large white tent, a handful of young men charge their phones at a bundle of wires and outlets in the far corner.
Flags are sketched in marker up and down the tarpaulin walls - Egypt, Syria, Tunisia, Eritrea, Sudan and Somalia, among others.
Fifty-year-old Andrea Costa, one of the founders of Baobab Experience, sits at a table of sheet wood and cinder blocks, describing the camp's work as part of the ""anti-fascist struggle"".
Baobab Experience provides immigration information, as well as food, clothing, medicine, language courses and tours of Rome.
Far-right groups have staged protests outside the centre and falsely accused organisers, who work on a volunteer basis, of making a profit off their work.
""We've had many problems with fascists, but fortunately, we responded to the fascist provocations by… insisting that we are not doing anything wrong and that big parts of the city are standing with us,"" he says.
""We've handled it well, but we have to tell migrants to keep an eye out when they are coming and going, to be safe.""
Flicking cigarette ash to the pavement, he concludes: ""We are very afraid because we are getting near the elections and it seems that all of the political parties … want to show they are tough on migration [in order] to get more votes.""
Outside, Ali sits next to the campfire under the twilit sky, ribbons of wraithlike smoke floating upward in front of him before disintegrating into the night.
He shakes his head in disappointment and slips on a weatherworn red beanie, pulling it down to his eyebrows.
The teenager repeats his wish to move elsewhere in Europe but says that, having given his fingerprints in Italy as part of the Dublin regulations, he fears being returned.
An austere expression on his face, he concludes: ""We didn't expect Europe to be like this.""
*Al Jazeera has withheld the surname of Ali, who is a minor, for his safety.

Dramatic footage captured in the countryside area by Al Jazeera showed men, women and children desperately trying to find the nearest cover after the attack - images of which were also included in the film.
Al Jazeera's Sinem Koseoglu, reporting from Antakya in southern Turkey, said the missile strike was the strongest violation yet of a peace accord agreed in Kazakhstan's capital, Astana, recently between Russia, Turkey and Iran.
""Syrians are not surprised. Many of them believe that it is a kind of the diplomatic leverage game just before the Sochi meeting that is going to be held at the end of January,"" she said.
A push by the forces loyal to Syria's President Bashar al-Assad aided by Russian air raids was causing a new wave of displacement from rebel-held territories.
About 120,000 people have fled their homes in Idlib province in recent weeks.
At least 179 people were killed in the besieged Damascus suburb of Eastern Ghouta in the past two weeks, according to activists.
Several people were in hospital after a bombing by government forces in Eastern Ghouta.
Aid workers on the scene said there were being treated for suffocation after a suspected chlorine gas attack.

The refugee, identified as Ahmed H, was give a 10-year prison sentence in November 2016 after a conviction based on Hungary's anti-terrorism law - which Amnesty International calls ""vague"" - for throwing stones at Hungarian police, using a megaphone to speak to the crowd of refugees on the border and allegedly helping to open a gate that allowed refugees to cross the frontier.
The trial will resume on March 14, with a verdict expected on March 19. The verdict was originally expected to be delivered on Friday.
Eda Seyhan, Amnesty International's campaigner on counter-terrorism in Europe, told Al Jazeera over the phone from Hungary that his conviction was an indicator of the anti-refugee stance of the Hungarian government.
""It's important to note that these things are very mixed, the vilification of refugees and migrants and the ramping up of anti-terrorism laws,"" Seyhan said.
In June, an appeals court ordered a retrial, saying that not all evidence may have been considered in the first trial.
Ahmed H was attempting to help his elderly parents leave Syria and cross into the European Union through Hungary's border with Serbia at the Roszke crossing, near the Hungarian city of Szeged.
In videos of the incident, the refugee and father, who was residing in Cyprus with his family at the time of the crossing, is seen telling police with a microphone that the asylum seekers ""came in peace"" and would not hurt officers.
Eventually, Hungarian police responded with tear gas and a water cannon. Many of the asylum seekers then threw objects at police.
According to videos shown in court, Ahmed H admitted to throwing two stones. However, it is unclear whether the Hungarian court will consider stone-throwing to be ""an act of terror"".
Much of the evidence being reviewed at the trial consists of video footage and witness testimony from police officers.
""None of the witness statements substantiate the charge,"" Seyhan said.
Hungary's ruling Fidesz party has maintained a hardline stance against refugees and migration since refugees began arriving in larger numbers in 2013 and 2014.
On Wednesday, the official Hungarian government Facebook page published a photo gallery of the events at Roszke that landed Ahmed H behind bars, entitled ""Ahmed H is a terrorist"".
The images contained in the gallery show the accused speaking to police with a megaphone from behind a barricade, hand raised in the air. Ahmed H is also seen speaking to refugees on his side of the barricade.
Further images show the aftermath of clashes between the groups. Ahmed H is not seen in these photos. The accused is also seen walking into a courtroom, handcuffed and escorted by masked Hungarian guards.
This was how Ahmed was escorted into court over the last week during the three hearings of his retrial.
Pal Volner, the parliamentary secretary of the Hungarian Ministry of Justice, has said that there ""is no doubt that a terrorist act"" can be found in Ahmed H's actions, including his throwing of objects at police officers.
Andras Lederer, the information and advocacy officer at the Hungarian Helsinki Committee (HHC), a human rights organisation and the only group that provides high-level legal advice to refugees for free, told Al Jazeera that refugees are facing a tough situation.
HHC is involved with several cases involving refugees, but not that of Ahmed H.
In March 2017, Hungarian law was changed to only accept refugee applications at two locations on the border and ""only five a day, on working days"" Lederer explained. As such, 50 asylum applications are allowed to commence in Hungary every week, Lederer said.
The application process can take years, and courts can refer cases back to immigration officers, essentially restarting the process. All asylum seekers are detained until the process is completed, which ""essentially allows for indefinite detention,"" Lederer said.
According to Hungarian government figures through November, 1,216 asylum seekers were granted protection and 2,880 applications were rejected.
Hungary also blocked entry of or deported nearly 22,000 migrants in that same period.
Ahmed H is the only refugee during years of the crisis to be charged with an ""act of terror"" in Hungary under Fidesz leadership.

A Palestinian teen from the Gaza Strip was killed east of the Burij refugee camp after a live round was fired into his chest, the Wafa news agency quoted medical sources as saying.
Three other Palestinians were wounded, one critically, it said.
An Israeli military spokeswoman said ""violent riots"" involving rock-throwing youth erupted at two locations along the Gaza border, and some 50 Palestinians were involved. Soldiers opened fire because the Palestinians ""posed a threat"".
Denny Cormier, a pro-Palestinian activist who lived in Gaza during the 2014 war, wrote on Twitter that it was likely the Israeli perpetrators knew the children did not pose a serious threat.
In the West Bank village of Iraq Burin, south of Nablus, a 16-year-old boy died in hospital after he was shot by Israeli troops as Palestinians pelted them with stones.
Soldiers manning a checkpoint outside the village opened fire without warning, said Ghassan Daghlas, who monitors illegal Israeli settlement activities in the northern West Bank.
Strict measures have been imposed on tens of thousands of Palestinians following the killing of an Israeli rabbi in a drive-by shooting in the West Bank this week.
Main roads have been closed, villages sealed off, and inspections of Palestinians increased.
The killing of the Israeli settler happened on Tuesday near the illegal Israeli settlement of Havat Gilad, where the 35-year-old rabbi resided.
Israeli settlements violate the Fourth Geneva Convention, which states that an occupying power cannot transfer its population into the territory it occupies.
Tensions in the region had increased since December when US President Donald Trump announced that Washington recognises Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.
The status of Jerusalem has ignited tensions between Israelis and Palestinians for decades.
Israel occupied East Jerusalem at the end of the 1967 war with Syria, Egypt and Jordan; the western half of the holy city had been captured in the 1948 Arab-Israeli war.
Israel's occupation of East Jerusalem effectively put the entire city under de facto Israeli control. Israeli jurisdiction and ownership of Jerusalem, however, is not recognised by the international community.
Palestinian leaders want East Jerusalem as the capital of their future state.

https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/01/czechs-head-polls-elect-president-180111174012867.html,refugee,979,Fri Jan 12 2018 10:17:59 GMT+0000,Philip Heijmans,Czechs head to the polls to elect next president,"Prague - Three months after the election of the populist Eurosceptic and billionaire Andrej Babis as prime minister, Czechs will once again head to the polls on Friday and Saturday to elect a new president.
The favourite in the field of nine candidates vying for a spot in the election runoff later this month is the outspoken incumbent, President Milos Zeman, who at 73 has watched his country become more politically divided during his five-year tenure.
As a member of an increasingly right-wing regional alliance of Central European nations, named the Visegrad Group, that includes Hungary, Poland and Slovakia, the Czech Republic stands at an ideological crossroads with the rise of the country's xenophobic far right, which rose to parliament in October’s legislative elections.
Jiri Pehe, director of New York University in Prague
Zeman has been a vocal opponent of Muslim integration and is seen as sympathetic to authoritarian regimes, while also becoming one of the Kremlin's most dependable allies in Europe.
They are views worrying many Czechs, who fear that their country may be backsliding from the democratic system they fought so fervently to achieve during the 1989 Velvet Revolution, which ended four decades under communism.
""In terms of a possible change in terms of a political movement, this is certainly the most important presidential election [in recent history].
""We are in a situation where if everything goes badly we could be faced with regime change, and though not another dictatorship, we could still perhaps become an illiberal democracy,"" said political analyst Jiri Pehe, director of New York University in Prague.
""It could indicate the end of the first democratic republic and the onset of the second republic.""
Since the split of Czechoslovakia 25 years ago, the presidency has become a somewhat ceremonial position with a limited but not insignificant scope of responsibilities that includes appointing high-ranking government positions and meeting foreign heads of state.
The president is also expected to advance the country’s political trajectory by toeing the line of policies of the elected parliament. That has not been Zeman's way.
In one example in October, then Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka accused Zeman of interfering in Czech foreign affairs and contradicting the government when he repeated his stance against EU sanctions on Russia over the Ukraine crisis while defending Russia's annexation of the Crimean peninsula as irreversible.
Zeman's speech ""was in sharp contradiction of our foreign policy and the president had no mandate to do it,"" Sobotka said at the time.
Capitalising on growing disdain for the country's dysfunctional government in the democratic era, Prime Minister Babis has promised to consolidate the role of government in favour of a stronger executive, drawing strong criticism from his opponents.
On Wednesday, Zeman pledged to stand by the caretaker prime minister even though he currently does not have enough support to win a vote of confidence from parliament.
With President Zeman all but declaring for Babis and no signs that the latter would be able to form a government before his term expires in early March, a new president may find himself in the position of calling for snap elections if Zeman has not already appointed him prime minister.
""If Babis is not yet appointed but is informally searching for support for his gov’t by that time, a new president could simply stop it, so the timing of these actions will be really important in this whole thing,"" said Pehe.
For many Czechs, the stakes are much higher. The election will serve as a barometer of the struggle for an identity for a nation that has increasingly moved away from progressive European integration and politics and towards nativism.
Standing against the traditional pro-western political establishment that has ruled in the Czech Republic in the early 1990s, Zeman has repeatedly shunned EU refugee quotas and lent his support to Tomio Okamura, the anti-Islamic, anti-EU leader of the Freedom and Direct Democracy party (SPD) that came to power in October.
""Ever since the beginning of our statehood a thousand years ago, the Czechs have belonged to the European West. There can be no ideological division on this question, and there can be no ideological division in questions such as human rights and the checks and balances of a mature liberal democracy,"" said Michal Horacek, a music producer, founder of one of the country's largest betting companies and independent presidential candidate.
Elections in the Czech Republic always tend to feature a cast of surreal characters who would not be out of place in a Kafka novel. In addition to Zeman - a heavy smoker and proud drinker - is Czech singer Petr Hannig and former prime minister Mirek Topolanek, who in 2009 was famously photographed naked with topless women at one of former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi's villas.
The most serious challengers to the incumbent though are the pro-EU left of centre Horacek and the 68-year-old centrist and former Czech Academy of Sciences chairman, Jiri Drahos.
""Zeman's appeal is connected not only with strong anti-immigrant attacks but also with some kind of Euroscepticism. If Mr Drahos wins, the president's image will be different because Drahos is intellectual oriented with no radical vision,"" Lubomir Kopecek, a political analyst at Masaryk University in Brno, told Al Jazeera.
If Zeman fails to win 50 percent of the vote required for an outright victory in this weekend's election - which is expected - then two candidates will compete in a runoff scheduled for later this month.
Some local polls see Zeman narrowly beat Drahos in a runoff, while Czech Television released a poll on Monday that has Drahos edging the president with 48.5 percent of the vote to Zeman's 44 percent. According to that same poll, Zeman is likely to receive 42.5 percent in the first round to Drahos' 27.5 percent.
""It's just too early to tell what will happen,"" said Pehe.

In an interview on Qatar TV on Wednesday, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani said a probe that began in May provided evidence that two countries were involved in the hacking of the country's state news agency website and its social media accounts, but did not specify any names.
On May 23, 2017, alleged hackers reportedly posted fake remarks on Qatar's official media platform criticising US foreign policy and attributing the statement to the country's emir.
Following the publication of the stories, Saudi Arabia and the UAE blocked the Qatar-based websites including Al Jazeera, and later led a group of Arab countries including Bahrain and Egypt in cutting diplomatic and trade ties with Doha.
In the articles, Qatar's Emir Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani was quoted as cautioning against confrontation with Iran, as well as defending the Palestinian group Hamas and Hezbollah, a Lebanese Shia movement allied with Tehran.
Qatar's government has categorically denied posting the comments.
""The state of Qatar does not rely on leaks or news stories that do not bear evidence about the state that committed the crime of hacking and the investigation proved that the two states were involved in the crime,"" said Al Thani.
Qatar's government has previously said that that there was proof the QNA hacking was linked to the blockading nations.
Doha also accused the UAE of violating international law after reports suggested that Abu Dhabi orchestrated the hacking.
Qatar sought the help of the US Federal Bureau of Investigation to investigate the source of the cyberattack.
Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain and Egypt severed diplomatic relations and cut off land, air and sea links with Qatar on June 5, accusing it of supporting ""terrorism"" and advancing the agenda of their regional rival, Iran. Doha strongly denies the charges.
Kuwait has led the mediation efforts with Turkey and the US also visiting the region to try to resolve the dispute.
In his interview with Qatar TV, Qatar's deputy prime minister said that there was a point of disgareement with the UAE two months prior to the blockade
While addressing some media attacks from the UAE, Qatar was asked to hand over the Doha-based wife of an Emirati dissident who left Abu Dhabi five or six years ago and moved to Britain, Al Thani said.
UAE envoys had made a similar request with Qatar's emir in 2015, but Shekih Tamim refused.
""It is in our morals and traditions as Arabs that we cannot hand over women, and the issue of refugee culture is rooted in our history,"" the foreign minister told Qatar TV.
He added: ""We assumed then the UAE's understanding of this step. The emir told them that we will not allow anyone to use Doha as a platform to attack the UAE or any Gulf country.
""We have fulfilled this promise before the matter was reopened in light of the attacks that were observed when we raised this issue, and they asked us to hand over the woman in return for ending the media attacks.""
Qatar has begun seeking international arbitration in an attempt to end the blockade imposed on it.

At a court hearing on Tuesday, the prosecutor asked for a 20 to 27-month prison sentence for the officer, Ben Deri, 21 at the time. He has pled guilty to a negligent killing charge, and sentencing is now scheduled for April 26.
""The court [hearing] was like a drama. Of course there is no justice,"" Siam Nawarah, Nadeem's father, told Al Jazeera.
Surrounded by large portraits of his son at his Ramallah home, Siam recounted how hope for justice progressively slipped away.
""Court hearings were always postponed with no valid reason. If Nadeem had killed Ben Deri, what would have happened? I think the court would have made a decision after two or three weeks and put him in jail,"" he said.
At one time under house arrest, Ben Deri now walks free.
Stored on his laptop, Siam Nawarah keeps files of every video, article, blog post, and TV news segment that was ever published or broadcast about Nadeem's killing. He sold his three hairdressing salons in order to follow the case - and perhaps because they reminded him of the time when most of his customers were Nadeem's friends. He travelled to the US to lobby Congress because ""Nadeem was killed by American weapons.""
He later founded an association that offers psychological and legal support to other families who went through the same excruciating experience.
On May 15, 2014, Nadeem was shot and killed at a demonstration near the Ofer military prison in the West Bank on Nakba Day, when Palestinians commemorate the displacement of hundreds of thousands in 1948. Another teenager, Mohammad Abu Daher, 16, was shot in the back and killed in exactly the same spot an hour later.
The demonstration evolved into clashes between Palestinian youth and Israeli forces. However, CCTV cameras - as confirmed by witness testimony - show the two boys just walking by the scene, and there appears to be no stone-throwing taking place at the time of the shooting.
Israeli authorities initially denied that live fire had been used, despite medical reports saying the type of wound indicated otherwise.
Forensic video analysis combining CCTV and media footage, as well as an autopsy ordered by Nawara's family on Nadeem's body, eventually led to Deri being indicted on a charge of manslaughter, which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years. The Israeli soldier was accused of knowingly firing live ammunition with the intent of causing ""serious injury, while foreseeing the possibility of causing his death"".
In January last year, Ben Deri's defence lawyer cut a plea deal with the prosecution, admitting to having fired a live round, but saying he had not been aware it wasn't non-lethal. The manslaughter charge was dropped, with Deri facing the less serious one of negligent killing.
The family felt betrayed by the prosecution and refused the plea bargain. They took the case to the Supreme Court, but lost the appeal.
""When Israel charged Ben Deri, all the journalists in the world said Israel is a state of law,"" Siam said. ""But after a month they put him under house arrest, and he's now free.""
The case is the last in which an Israeli soldier or border police officer was indicted for the killing of a minor at a demonstration, according to Ayed Abu Eqtaish, accountability director at Defense for Children International Palestine (DCIP), the organisation that first published the forensic video examination.
At least 29 children have been killed in protests in the West Bank, Gaza, and East Jerusalem since 2014.
Gatherings of 10 or more people for a political purpose are banned in the West Bank. Israeli security forces are legally allowed to use live ammunition only in life-threatening situations. However, Israeli human rights group B'Tselem says forces on the ground are often given orders that contradict official directives. ""Crowd control"" weapons such as rubber-coated steel bullets and tear gas canisters have also proved lethal.
More than 2,000 Palestinian children have been killed since the outset of the Second Intifada in 2000, including during military operations, according to a DCIP count.
According to B'Tselem figures, 99 Palestinians were shot and killed by Israeli security forces in the West Bank in 2015 (23 by border police and 76 by soldiers) and 17 in East Jerusalem. And yet, only 21 investigations were opened.
Since a policy change in April 2011, the Israeli army is required to open a case automatically for every fatality that occurs outside of combat situations.
""We don't know whether they carry out an investigation or not,"" Abu Eqtaish told Al Jazeera. ""What we're sure about is that there is a culture of impunity and that this year and in the past few years none of the killings led to an indictment.""
The case of Mohammad Abu Daher, the teen killed on the same day as Nadeem, is only one example.
""We all know he was killed, but it's like he doesn't exist,"" Firas Asali, the Nawarah family's lawyer, told Al Jazeera. ""No one filed a complaint about him, there was no autopsy, and we don't have any substantial evidence.
""It would have made the case [Nadeem's] stronger because then there would be evidence there wasn't any negligence, that you have two people dead, not one,"" Asali said.
In 2014, B'Tselem stopped filing complaints to the Israeli military on behalf of Palestinians about killings and other types of violations in the West Bank.
""We realise the system is not designed to take any action against those responsible for violations against Palestinians, but it's a whitewash mechanism that creates the pretence of a legitimate system that is actually looking at the complaints and checking them,"" Yael Stein, research director at B'Tselem, told Al Jazeera.
In Jalazone refugee camp near Ramallah, Hoda and Abdallah Sharaka try and make sense of what happened to them.
In October 2015, their son, Ahmad Sharaka, 14, was killed at a demonstration near the illegal West Bank settlement of Beit El, not far from his home. He was shot with a rubber-coated metal round that struck him behind his left ear.
In a commemorative poster outside his family home, he appears suspended in midair, his gracile body stretched out as he fires a slingshot. The poster calls him ""the Slingshot Eagle"".
While Siam Nawarah knows his son's death is being investigated as an exception, the Sharakas - without any security footage or video - know there is no possibility of seeking justice for their son's death. He is, in their view, another Palestinian ""martyr"" - the second in the family.
""He was very brave, throwing stones without any fear inside,"" Hoda Sharaka said, pointing at a version of the same poster inside their modest living room. His mother explained that after Ahmad died, a lawyer visited the family to open an investigation into his case. Palestinians can only file complaints with the help of lawyers or human rights organisations.
""We don't know what happened exactly, she came here to talk to us and she said she wanted to help,"" Hoda said, adding they didn't go to court and there's no longer communication between them.
Al Jazeera asked the Israeli army if an investigation had ever been opened in this case, but a spokesperson wasn't able to find any information by the time of publication.
During the interview with the Sharakas, Abdallah left the room and came back with a bag of clothes his son wore the day he died. The tiny trousers, a T-shirt, green balaclava, black-and-white keffiyeh, and a Fatah flag were then neatly laid out on the floor.
""No one will give us back what we lost,"" Hoda said, no longer able to hold back tears.

On December 12, reporters Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo from the Reuters news agency were handed a rolled up document by two police officers. They said they had just returned from Myanmar's troubled Rakhine state, where more than 650,000 Rohingya Muslims have fled a brutal military crackdown, sparked by a series of rebel attacks on security forces in August.
Upon leaving the restaurant where the four men met, Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo were promptly arrested by seven policemen, patiently waiting outside.
Myanmar's Ministry of Information said the pair ""illegally acquired information with the intention to share it with foreign media"". The families of the reporters - both of whom had been working on stories about the military's operation in Rakhine state - said they were lured into a trap.
""The situation for press freedom in Myanmar has got a lot worse since the Rohingya crisis began,"" said Daniel Bastard from Reporters Without Border's Asia-Pacific desk.
According to its data, 12 journalists were arrested in Myanmar in 2017 compared to just two the previous year.
Myanmar's military stand accused of a litany of human rights abuses in northern Rakhine. Graphic reports of rape, murder, and torture have drawn international condemnation and the United Nations says ""genocide"" cannot be ruled out.
""The case of the two Reuters journalists is very significant in this regard, they were reporting on a village that had been attacked by the military so the authorities are doing whatever they can to shut them up,"" said Bastard.
On Wednesday, Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo were marched into a courtroom packed with concerned representatives from the United Nations, European Union, and numerous Western governments. In an appearance that lasted no longer than 12 minutes, the pair were formally charged under section 3.1c of the 1928 Official Secrets Act.
""We view this as a wholly unwarranted, blatant attack on press freedom,"" said Stephen J Adler, president and editor-in-chief of Reuters.
On his way out of the courtroom, Wa Lone was given the bittersweet news that his wife was expecting a child. If found guilty of the draconian law, his first-born son or daughter will be 14-years-old by the time he is released from prison.
""We never made any mistakes, they are trying to stop us and intimidate us,"" the stunned journalist said as eight police officers ushered him out of the courtroom, his wife still clutching his hand, tears glistening on her cheek.
Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo are not the first journalists to be charged under a colonial-era law over the last 12 months. Both the 1908 Unlawful Association Act and 1934 Aircraft Act were employed in 2017 to detain journalists reporting on conflict in Myanmar.
""Authorities are using antiquated laws to prosecute journalists and to create a climate of fear under the watch of Aung San Suu Kyi. This government is looking increasingly authoritarian by the day,"" said David Baulk, Myanmar human rights specialist at Fortify Rights.
His thoughts were echoed by freelance journalist Aung Naing Soe, who recently served two months in prison after his colleagues from Turkish news channel TRT World were caught in possession of a drone near the parliament building.
""The government are trying to show us that they still hold the power and that we cannot report on whatever we want, even if we are doing the right thing and holding the government to account,"" he told Al Jazeera, a week after his release.
But if intimidation is the motive, it does not appear to be working. Wednesday's court hearing was attended by an army of local journalists, proudly wearing their new, uniform of solidarity - a black T-shirt with ""Journalism is not a crime"" clearly inscribed on its front and rear.
""This is not an issue of free press, it is a legal issue,"" said government spokesperson U Zaw Htay in a conversation with Al Jazeera. ""The government is committed to freedom of expression, but another of our priorities is the rule of law and we expect journalists to abide by our laws.""
Some of the locals tend to agree with him. When U Kyaw Khin first opened his roadside newspaper stall in 1998, Myanmar journalists had to submit their work to the government for pre-publication approval.
""The only limitation now is that we cannot insult the government without any proof. The problem with foreign media is that they are biased, they write about whatever they want and they do not speak to people on all sides,"" said the spritely 67-year-old.
Reporting on both sides of the Rohingya crisis has proven difficult for members of the foreign press who are prohibited from entering the conflict-torn areas of Rakhine state and rarely granted interviews with top government officials.
Their dependency on information gathered from the swelling refugee population in Bangladesh has earned them pariah status in Myanmar, where the Rohingya are widely perceived as foreign terrorists.
More worryingly, it has emboldened nationalist voices who - like the military dictators that terrorised Myanmar - say journalists who challenge the official narrative should be punished for their treachery.
""Put them [Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo] in prison for many years so that they will be afraid to betray us again. This is our country, our land!!"" commented U Min Nwe Win on a local newspaper's Facebook page.
With the judicial system as slow as it is archaic, it will likely be sometime before the outcome of this controversial case is announced.
U Min Nwe Win may be mistaken if he thinks the arrests will silence journalists who dare challenge the government. It is not just Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo who are on trial, but press freedom in Myanmar itself.

An original European Commission proposal seeking to redistribute 160,000 asylum seekers throughout the EU from overcrowded camps in Greece and Italy fell significantly short after completing just 31,000 relocations by its end last September.
""We were slow to implement the proposals,"" Mouzalas said on Tuesday.
""There were member states … which sabotaged these proposals; and it took a great struggle on the part of the Commission and the ministries to prevent this sabotage from leading to a failure of the programme.""
Mouzalas was referring to Hungary, Poland and Denmark, who refused to participate in the programme. Austria, the Czech Republic and Slovakia all together took in just 45 people.
Over the last three years, Greece and Italy have become the main gateways for 1.5 million refugees arriving on Europe's shores. Under current EU rules, known as the Dublin II regulation, refugees must apply for asylum in the first EU country they arrive in - an impossible burden for the Greek and Italian authorities dealing with asylum requests.
The spat over the bloc's Relocation Programme has now opened up a gulf between EU members over how to reshape a future asylum policy.
""The idea of institutionalising relocation has become part of the Dublin reform discussion, and it has become deeply contentious within that,"" Elizabeth Collett, director of the Migration Policy Institute, Europe, told Al Jazeera.
""[It] is one of the reasons why the Dublin reform discussion has largely stalled.""
Mouzalas said that the dispute has weakened, rather than strengthened, the prospect of a common EU migration policy.
""The EU, through its institutions, tried to create a common treatment,"" he told Al Jazeera.
""I think that in the first phase … this failed … Xenophobic parties are playing en ever-larger role in the formation of the political agenda. There is a turning. One cannot say whether this will win in the end,"" he said.
Collett agreed that EU members had ""moved further apart"", arguing that the problem lay in mistaken assumptions as Europe expanded eastwards.
""The events of the last three years raised a question that had conveniently been sidestepped,"" she said.
""When Europe went through its major enlargement in 2004 [with the accession of 10 new countries], the question was never put, 'Are you willing to host large numbers of refugees?' I think it was assumed by existing member states that acceding member states understood this, and by acceding member states that it would never be required of them.
""What happened in 2015 or 2016 [at the height of the refugee crisis] was that the question was asked and the answer came back, 'No, we're not ready to do that.' That placed a fundamental political question on the table: on what basis is Europe collectively prepared to do protection? That question has yet to be resolved, and we seem to be moving further apart with each passing month.""
The person in charge of creating Greece's Asylum Service in 2013 took a more optimistic view.
""If we look back over the last three years in the EU, it's an unprecedented period,"" said Maria Stavropoulou, referring to the period that saw Europe grappling with the what has been described as the worst refugee and migrant crisis since World War II.
""Many things happened very quickly … People usually go forward not running but stumbling. The Relocation Programme was a process of trial and error.""
Stavropoulou, who steps down as the service's director next month, argued that the EU proved that relocation ""works if we give it a chance, and it works very well"".
She also said she believed that the naysayers would ultimately change their position.
""Sooner or later, member states tend to act like persons,"" she said. ""There's a lot of human psychology in the way countries and governments act, and they like to be eventually members of a club ... because it is in their self-interest.""
Rosa Balfour, a European foreign policy expert at the German Marshall Fund, a think-tank, also held out hope.
She said she saw the relocation debate as part of a broader tug-of-war between Brussels and member states over national sovereignty versus supranational decision making.
""It wasn't just about the numbers, [holdouts] also wanted to affirm the principle that the Commission could not tell them what to do… at the moment everyone is pushing boundaries to see how far they can go,"" said Balfour.
According to Balfour, the Commission has scope to leverage its power in the run-up to the EU's next financial perspective for the 2020-2027 period, which sets a ceiling on the amount the bloc can spend in any of these years.
Poland and Hungary claim 105bn euro ($125bn) in EU funds during the current period, a significant contribution to their Gross Domestic Programme, and the Commission is considering tying funds to compliance on rule of law, freedom of speech and other issues.
""If [holdouts] were to be negatively affected by stricter conditionality on, say, rule of law issues … they could decide to renegotiate their position on certain policies, they could do some horse-trading and decide what the priorities are,"" said Balfour.
The Greek government now wants the EU to focus on expanding its Resettlement Programme, which allows refugees to apply for asylum directly from third countries deemed safe such as Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey.
That, officials in Athens believe, would undermine human traffickers and take pressure off the Aegean route, one of the main ways for refugees to reach Europe via sea.
""It really needs to become the main legal avenue for refugees towards the EU,"" said Stavropoulou. ""To make a dent, if it is going to undercut the business model of the smugglers, it has to be significant numbers.""
Stavropoulou said she believed that means in the hundreds of thousands of refugees a year, but the Commission's current plan seeks to resettle only 50,000 in the next two years.
The stakes for Europe are much higher than the well-being of refugees and the upholding of humanitarian law, said Collett.
The outcome of the European migration debate has the power to either advance or unravel the European project, she argued.
""Can we maintain an area of internal free movement where there are no border controls? The Schengen area, upon which all this immigration and asylum discussion is based … is more in question now than it ever has been,"" she said.
""If these big questions are not resolved, some countries will start asking, 'Should we all be working together in Schengen? Should we change the shape of Schengen? Should we have more than one of these things?' I think there are those very, very quiet conversations taking place.""
Daniel Esdras, head of the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) in Greece, said he would ""never forget the first group [of relocation subjects], which was bound for Luxembourg"".
It was IOM's job to prepare relocation subjects and make logistical preparations for their move - and he remembers well how unlikely those new beginnings seemed to amount to anything.
""We had to convince the airline to accept this group; we had to help the [Luxembourg] embassy prepare the paperwork … there was nothing. But we had to make a start,"" he says.
""If we had not begun by taking risks and [displaying] courage and using all our strength, this programme would not have run as it did.""

The remote Rukban refugee camp, which is home to at least 55,000 refugees, received food and other essential items by crane lift on Monday.
The aid drop came after a request from the United Nations amid concerns about poor living conditions in the makeshift camp, where many are suffering from malnutrition.
The refugees were trapped there when Jordan sealed its border with Syria following an attack on its soldiers there that was claimed by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL, also known as ISIS) group in June 2016.
The move impeded delivery of life-saving humanitarian aid and severely restricted humanitarian agencies' capacity to operate there.
Several months of talks between Jordanian officials and the UN, which was asked to present a plan for the delivery, led to the agreement for the one-time aid drop.
According to the Petra state news agency, the delivery on Monday was assisted by Jordanian army and foreign ministry staff.
Officials in Jordan have previously said that Rukban camp ""will never be a Jordanian responsibility"", insisting said that aid must come from the Syrian side.
By using a crane to drop the aid onto the informal settlement, Jordan can continue to maintain this position as it has not had direct contact with the camp or its inhabitants.
Jordan is concerned that there may be ISIL sleeper cells within Rukban camp.
An estimated 1.5 million Syrians have fled to Jordan since the beginning of the civil war in 2011.

In a series of tweets on Sunday evening, a spokesperson for the UN agency said it would continue providing help to Palestinian refugees until the international community comes up with a solution for their plight.
""UNRWA is assigned by the General Assembly to continue its services until a fair solution to Palestinian refugees issue is reached,"" UNRWA official Sami Mushasha noted.
His comments came shortly after Netanyahu called for the agency to be scrapped, accusing it of helping ""fictitious refugees.
""UNRWA is an organisation that perpetuates the Palestinian refugee problem and the narrative of the right-of-return, as it were, in order to eliminate the State of Israel,"" the Israeli leader said, adding the development agency needed ""to pass from the world"".
The agency plays a significant role in supporting Palestinian refugees with access to education, healthcare, social services and employment in the occupied Palestinian territories and in neighbouring states.
Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians were expelled from their homes in historic Palestine by Zionist militias during the 1948 Arab-Israeli war and later by the Israeli army during the 1967 war.
Today, those refugees and their descendants total more than five million people.
Netanyahu's comments come less than a week after US President Donald Trump threatened to cut off American funding to the Palestinian Authority (PA) for not showing enough ""appreciation or respect"" towards the United States.
""With the Palestinians no longer willing to talk peace, why should we make any of these massive future payments to them?"" Trump asked.
Analysts have warned that if the US leader follows through with the threat, and the withdrawal of aid includes funds earmarked for UNRWA, there would be a big strain on the PA to cover those costs.

Cranes and bulldozers are perpetually growling, sifting through concrete and dirt to make room for thousands of Palestinians moving into this densely populated Jerusalem neighbourhood.
Kufr Aqab and Shuafat refugee camp - consisting of eight neighbourhoods that house at least 140,000 Palestinians - have been cut off from the rest of Jerusalem by Israel's separation wall.
While these areas are governed by Israel, they are located on the West Bank side of Israel's wall, declared illegal by the International Court of Justice more than a decade ago.
Kufr Aqab and Shuafat refugee camp are neglected by the Jerusalem municipality, but beyond the control of the Palestinian Authority (PA). Police are absent and municipal services are limited.
""All of these people are living here solely to keep their Jerusalem IDs,"" Moien Odeh, a Jerusalem-based legal expert, told Al Jazeera, gesturing to a sea of high-rise buildings in Kufr Aqab.
The lack of available land means that these homes are built higher and higher to accommodate an exploding population, estimated to be about 65,000.
Most Palestinians here are escaping a housing crisis and soaring prices in Jerusalem, while couples with mixed IDs - Jerusalem and West Bank - are forced to live in the area simply to stay together.
Piles of rubbish cover roadsides in Kufr Aqab and overflow from dumpsters, growing larger each day as residents wait for the municipality's infrequent rubbish collection services.
Munir Zaghayer, who heads Kufr Aqab's neighbourhood committee, remembers when Kufr Aqab was a scenic and upscale Jerusalem neighbourhood. ""We used to have a beautiful life here,"" he said.
Zaghayer moved to Kufr Aqab from Jerusalem's Old City in 1962. Before the wall was built, the population in Kufr Aqab did not exceed 12,000, he said.
However, when Israel constructed the separation wall, the neighbourhood started transforming. Israel had implemented policies more than a half-century ago that would determine Kufr Aqab's fate.
In 1967, when Israel occupied and subsequently annexed East Jerusalem, Palestinians in East Jerusalem were not granted Israeli citizenship, but were instead issued Jerusalem residency status.
Palestinians with Jerusalem IDs must consistently prove to Israel that Jerusalem is the centre of their life, or else face the revocation of their residency. Almost 15,000 Palestinians have had their Jerusalem IDs revoked since 1967, according to Human Rights Watch.
Following its takeover of East Jerusalem, Israel reduced the land zoned for Palestinian construction to some 13 percent, most of which was already built up. A housing crisis in Palestinian neighbourhoods ensued, followed by routine Israeli demolition campaigns carried out on Palestinian homes and structures, as residents were forced to build without permits.
But in Kufr Aqab, Israel ceased enforcing its municipal regulations once the wall was built, making home demolitions extremely rare. Coupled with the cheaper cost of living, this prompted tens of thousands of Palestinian Jerusalem residents to flock to the neighbourhood. Since Kufr Aqab is still within Jerusalem's municipal borders, Palestinians moving there can maintain their Jerusalem residency.
Yet the municipality fails to provide basic services to the neighbourhoods beyond the wall, including education, waste removal and road maintenance. The residents receive just two days of running water a week, despite paying municipal and other taxes.
Odeh says Israel's neglect has reached a ""discriminatory"" level, noting that as of 2015, the entire budget for improving infrastructure in Jerusalem was 880 million shekels ($256m) - but Kufr Aqab and Shuafat refugee camp were allocated just 800,000 shekels ($233,000) between them.
""There's discrimination against all Palestinian communities in East Jerusalem,"" Odeh told Al Jazeera. ""But it's nothing like what communities face on the other side of the wall.""
When the neighbourhood does receive services, the city hires private sub-contractors, who deliver the services as cheaply as possible. This involves burning rubbish, smoke from which poses serious health risks, and hiring as few workers as possible, Odeh said.
Kufr Aqab resident Hamdi Abu Saada told Al Jazeera that traffic was one of the worst aspects of life here. To visit relatives or go to work in Jerusalem, he must enter the city through Israel's congested Qalandiya checkpoint, forcing him to endure a two-hour commute each day - even though his workplace is just several hundred metres from his home on the other side of the wall.
""It's painful,"" Abu Saada said. ""I live on the 10th floor of my building. I can see everything in front of me, but I can't reach it.""
At least 2,000 Palestinian couples in Kufr Aqab are living there solely because one of the spouses has a West Bank ID, Zaghayer said.
Palestinians with West Bank IDs are not allowed to cross Israeli checkpoints into Jerusalem or Israel without Israeli-issued permits. Kufr Aqab, like other Jerusalem neighbourhoods cut off by the wall, is a place where Palestinians with Jerusalem IDs can live with their West Bank spouses without endangering their residency status.
Jihad Hadross, 39, moved to Kufr Aqab from the small village of Deir Ballut in the Salfit district of the occupied West Bank five years ago after marrying his wife from Jerusalem's Old City. He has been waiting for six years to receive a permit through Israel's family reunification process that would allow him to live in Jerusalem with his wife. ""We live in this place just to wait,"" he told Al Jazeera.
When Hadross' two children, who have Jerusalem ID numbers, become sick, he cannot accompany them to the hospitals in Jerusalem. He has also missed out on countless school events and activities, unable to obtain an Israeli permit in time to enter Jerusalem.
""It's a very difficult life,"" Hadross told Al Jazeera. ""But we live our lives with the hope that things will change.""
Other couples in Kufr Aqab have been waiting for up to 10 years for their spouses to receive permission to live in Jerusalem on the other side of the wall, Hadross said.
""It's a waiting game,"" he said. ""The Israelis don't say no to you, but they make you wait for years, with the hope that you will just give up and move to the West Bank.""
Once a couple moves to the West Bank, the Jerusalem resident loses the right to live in Jerusalem.
""I feel very lonely here,"" Hadross said, taking a slow drag from a cigarette. ""I'm not sure what will happen with us. But I know that I do not want to continue living in Kufr Aqab. No one does.""
According to Odeh, the lack of municipal services and the problems facing couples with different IDs ""are all part of Israel's long-term goal: push Palestinians out of Jerusalem"".
The municipality's decision not to enforce building regulations in Kufr Aqab and Shuafat refugee camp was meant to create a mass influx of Palestinians to these areas beyond the wall, Odeh said.
Israeli leaders have been discussing for years the possibility of removing these areas from Jerusalem's municipality.
""Israel wants to make the Palestinian population to be about five to 10 percent of Jerusalem's population,"" Odeh said, noting that this is done through the systematic expulsion of Palestinians from the city's limits and policies aimed at increasing the number of Jewish residents.
Palestinians in Kufr Aqab fear that if the area is removed from Jerusalem's municipality, Israel will then make moves to strip them of their Jerusalem IDs.
""Israel wants a land without a people,"" Odeh said. ""This is why this land is considered Israeli, but its people are not. They want Jerusalem to be a Jewish city"".

Talks between the country's two major parties - Merkel's Christian Democrat alliance (CDU/CSU) and the Social Democratic Party (SDP) - to form a new ruling coalition resumed in the capital, Berlin, on Sunday.
""I think we can do it. We will work very quickly, very intensively. That’s what we set out to do,"" Merkel told reporters.
""I am optimistic about these talks, but I also know that there is a lot of work ahead of us in the coming days. We are willing to take on the work.""
The talks between the two former government allies come after an initial attempt by Merkel to form a ruling three-way coalition with the Free Democrats (FDP) and Green Party failed in November.
Al Jazeera's David Chater, reporting from Berlin, said post-war Germany had not experienced a similar situation before where a caretaker government had been in office for some four months.
He called the talks ""critical"", adding that they were aimed at exploring areas where formal negotiations would take place.
A potential sticking point in the talks is the refugee crisis, with the two sides divided over whether to allow relatives of people who are already in Germany to join them.
In September's poll, Merkel's CDU/CSU secured 33 percent of the vote, down about nine percent compared with the previous election in 2013 - failing to form a single-party government.
The SPD, led by Martin Schulz, had consistently ruled out being part of another so-called grand coalition since scoring just 20.5 percent of the vote in September's vote.
""Essentially, the Social Democrats received a lot of damage by being part of the previous grand coalition and gained nothing electorally,"" said Chater.
""Even if they come to an agreement, the SPD will have a party delegation on January 21 where members will have to approve it - so even that has to go through another hurdle,"" he added.
""This crisis is far from over.""
A faction called ""NoGroKo"", or ""no grand coalition"", has been formed within SDP to defend a stance against working with Merkel again following September's election result.
Merkel has been the chancellor of Germany for the last 12 years.
A longer government vacuum in Europe's largest and strongest economy might have an impact on several issues, including stability in the eurozone.

Earlier this week, Israel approved a plan to force asylum seekers to choose between indefinite detention in an Israeli prison, or deportation to a third country in Africa.
The migrants were told they had three months to leave, drawing condemnation by activists who said the Israeli's government move would endanger people's lives.
Israel did not specify where the asylum seekers should go, but local media and rights groups have previously said that Rwanda and Uganda had agreed to take in migrants from Israel.
On Friday, however, Rwandan Foreign Minister Olivier Nduhungirehe said his country had not signed such a deal, calling the claims ""fake news"" in response to a Twitter post by Kenneth Roth, executive director of Human Rights Watch.
""Rwanda has no deal whatsoever with Israel to host any African migrant from that country,"" he said.
Nice try Ken! You thought that you found a new opening to bash your ""favourite"" country, but I am sorry to tell you this: #Rwanda has no deal whatsoever with #Israel to host any African migrant from that country.This story is no news; it's FAKE NEWS, as you like them.
Okello Oryem, Uganda's foreign minister, has also denied the existence of such an agreement, calling any suggestion to the contrary ""absolute rubbish"".
""There is no written agreement or any form of agreement between the government of Uganda and the Israeli government to accept refugees from Israel,"" he was quoted as saying on Friday by news agencies.
Currently, Israel is home to about 40,000 asylum seekers, according to government figures. That includes 27,500 Eritrean and 7,800 Sudanese asylum seekers, the UN refugee agency (UNHCR) has reported.
According to the Israeli scheme, asylum seekers will be given a plane ticket and up to $3,500 for leaving.
Speaking as the plan was approved by his cabinet on Wednesday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the move against asylum seekers - whom he referred to as ""infiltrators"" - would help Israel to ""guard its borders"".
""The infiltrators have a clear choice - cooperate with us and leave voluntarily, respectably, humanely and legally, or we will have to use other tools at our disposal, which are also according to the law,"" he said.
Most asylum seekers in Israel are from Sudan and Eritrea. They arrived in the country over the last decade via Egypt and most have fled war, torture and other mistreatment.
Between December 2013 and June of this year, about 4,000 Sudanese and Eritrean asylum seekers were deported under Israel's ""voluntary departure programme"" to Rwanda and Uganda, according to the UN's refugee agency (UNHCR).
In November, the UNHCR raised alarm that those who had already been relocated through that scheme were not receiving support after leaving Israel.
""UNHCR is concerned that these persons have not found adequate safety or a durable solution to their plight and that many have subsequently attempted dangerous onward movements within Africa or to Europe,"" it said in a statement.

More than 30 homes where migrant labourers reside - most of whom are Pakistani nationals - have been targeted since December 25, the anti-racist group Keerfa said on Friday.
Petros Constantinou, Keerfa's national director, said the sharp uptick in violence comes amid a 40-day period of attacks on migrant homes in the area.
""It's been happening at least three times per week,"" he told Al Jazeera. ""They are targeting homes where it is obvious migrants are living.""
The incidents have taken place primarily in Renti and Nikaia, two neighbourhoods in Piraeus with large immigrant populations.
Constantinou said anti-Muslim slogans had also been spray-painted on the entrances and walls of several homes. ""These appear to be organised attacks,"" he said, explaining that the assailants were swiftly picked up by getaway cars after the incidents concluded.
He added that similar attacks have taken place to a lesser degree in nearby neighbourhoods in recent weeks.
""It seems that the attack squads of Golden Dawn are coming back and teaching new members how to attack migrants,"" Constantinou argued, referring to the Greek neo-fascist party that currently has 16 seats in the national parliament.
Javed Aslam, president of the Pakistani Community in Greece organisation, explained that the attackers broke the glass of windows in several homes while shouting xenophobic comments.
""They are saying 'you're dirty, leave our country' while they do it,"" he told Al Jazeera.
Noting that no one has been injured yet in the recent spate of attacks, Aslam warned nonetheless: ""It looks like the fascists are preparing for more violent attacks [on migrants].""
While Aslam said it is still uncertain who the assailants were, he also suspects that they are members of Golden Dawn.
""Who else could be behind these attacks?""
In an ostensibly unrelated statement published on Friday, the Golden Dawn said that ""Islam is incapable of coexisting with western culture"".
""If Europe, and even more obviously Greece, does not realise the complete failure of the 'political integration' of the illegal Muslim immigration to Europe and Greece which overwhelms us … we will soon be lead into enormous problems, [including] wars in our own cities,"" the Greek-language statement proclaimed.
In past years, Golden Dawn members orchestrated attacks on migrants, refugees and political opponents in areas across the country.
In January 2013, a pair of men linked to Golden Dawn killed Shahzad Luqman, a 26-year-old Pakistani who was on his way to work while he was fatally stabbed.
Later that year, in September, a Golden Dawn member stabbed to death Pavlos Fyssas, an anti-fascist rapper, in the Keratsini neighbourhood of Piraeus.
In 2017, Aslam explained, there was a sharp increase in attacks targeting Pakistani labourers in areas near Athens, particularly in the industrial area of Aspropyrgos.
In October, a group of black-clad men attacked a pair of Pakistani workers in Aspropyrgos, beating them with metal bars and stabbing them.
During that attack, the men threatened to burn the migrants alive, Ashfak Mahmoud, one of the victims, told local media at the time.
Between August 2016 and August 2017, the Pakistani Community in Greece recorded between 70 and 80 attacks targeting migrant workers in Aspropyrgos.
During the first six months of 2017, Greek police recorded at least 75 hate crimes, while they documented 84 hate crimes during the entirety of 2016, according to statistics provided to Al Jazeera.
Of that total, police documented 47 hate crimes motivated by race, skin colour or national origin between January and June of last year. Comparatively, 48 such incidents took place throughout all of 2016.
The police statistics for the second half of 2017 are not yet available.
Asked about the political affiliations of the perpetrators, a police spokesperson said police do not quantify hate crimes based on ""ideological background"" of ""any person or groups of people"" who execute such attacks.
Yet, rights groups and monitors warn that official statistics can be misleading because victims often do not file reports with the police.
Tina Stavrinaki, a legal officer at the Racist Violence Recording Network, explained that several incidents in 2017 ""should alert us of the reappearance of group violence"", referring to a wave of xenophobic violence that gripped the country in 2012 and 2013.
""But it doesn't mean necessarily that this indicates a return to the same situation as 2012 and 2013,"" she told Al Jazeera. ""Nonetheless, we have to be vigilant and remain alert.""
In November, a group of masked men attacked the home of an 11-year-old Afghan refugee who had gained national attention a month earlier after being prevented from carrying a Greek flag during a school parade.
The boy was identified only as Emir in the local press.
After smashing windows and throwing rocks and beer bottles at the home, the assailants left behind a letter that read: ""Go back to your village. Leave.""
A previously unknown group called Crypteia, a reference to a group of ancient Spartans notorious for attacking slaves, subsequently claimed responsibility for the attack on the boy's home.
Crypteia is believed to be an offshoot of the Golden Dawn, which has scaled back attacks in recent years due to the ongoing trial of 69 members who are accused of running a criminal organisation.

These experiences are what many refugees and migrants in Greece say defined 2017 for them.
More than 60,000 refugees and migrants are trapped in Greece due to sealed borders across the so-called Balkan route and the March 2016 deal between Turkey and the European Union, which was sculpted to stem the flow of displaced people to Europe.
That deal has been roundly condemned by rights groups and watchdogs.
More than 15,000 refugees and migrants have been confined to Greek islands by a government policy that bars them from moving to the mainland until their asylum procedures have been completed.
Although arrivals sharply decreased after the EU-Turkey deal, the United Nations refugee agency (UNHCR) statistics say that more than 170,317 people made the treacherous journey across the Mediterranean Sea in 2017.
At least 3,081 died or went missing along the way.
Speaking to Al Jazeera, some refugees in Greece explained that they no longer feel welcome, while others said they have started to build their lives from scratch.
A lot of refugees have been arrested and put in jail. Greece has been rejecting refugees [asylum requests]. People are living in the streets; they have a bad situation.
Before, they were telling refugees to come and apply for asylum [in Europe].
Now, people are not getting asylum - it is taking a long time and many people are getting negative [replies to their requests], especially single men.
I lived in a tent for one year and six months. Now I'm in a container, but in one container there are five people. It's a bad situation inside.
There is a heater, but it doesn't work. In the winter, it's cold. In the summer, there is no air conditioner. If you ask for a blanket, they [camp authorities] have just one answer: 'We don't have one.'
They [Greek authorities] have been moving me to different camps all the time. It's because I've protested for the rights of refugees. It's like jail. You don't have rights. We aren't eating the food.
Yesterday, I opened the food and it smelled bad - it was two days old. We threw it in the garbage. If you tell them you're human and not to give you bullsh*t food, they tell you to leave.
If you think about the situation in Greece, there are economic problems.
The Greek people also don't have money. If the educated people from Greece don't have jobs, how can I expect refugees to find work?
But we are hard workers. Now we are just collecting rubbish, working illegally for little money - three or four euros a day.
First, [Europe] loved refugees. Now they hate refugees. They are trying to force refugees to leave this country. So, we see that we don't have a future here.
I've tried many times to leave Greece. First, I tried to go to Macedonia in 2016. Second, I tried to leave Patras [to Italy]. Police arrested me for two nights, didn't give me food and beat me a lot. I've also tried to leave from the airport.
Two years ago, when I first arrived, no one asked if I'm really a refugee and who I am. Now, if you walk in the street, there are a lot of people treating you like sh*t.
I've been in Greece for a year and a half. I was working as a photographer in Iraq, and I was covering the war as the ISIL entered the situation.
I left after I was close to a car bombing. I wasn't hurt, but that was why I chose to go.
I went to Turkey, but I wasn't happy with the life there. I decided to come to Europe.
I had decided to go to Germany, but when I came to Greece I was happy with the country and the Greek people.
I didn't feel that they were racist or sectarian.
I started studying English and Greek, and then I met someone who invited me to come to City Plaza [a refugee squat in Athens].
I made good relations here. The Greek people have been good with me, and I haven't felt any racism or discrimination, so I decided to continue my life here.
I've applied to asylum for here, and I want to live in Greece.
The only problem here is the work. It's very hard to find work, and especially as a photographer. It's also hard because I don't speak English well and I don't speak much Greek.
For me, I'm not scared of returning to Iraq, but I don't have a future there.
That's why I decided to leave. The last few years have been very hard in Iraq, especially since ISIL came.
I was only 18 years when that started. I don't like war or violence. That's not for me, and working as a photographer in war isn't my role.
I want to continue my work. Now, I'm starting over, so it's hard to begin from scratch. The situation is very good in City Plaza.
It's a place for refugees to start building their lives again. If it wasn't for City Plaza, maybe I'd be sleeping in the streets.
I've been in Greece for two years. I came with my wife and two boys. They are three and five years old. I haven't seen any good changes for refugees in the last two years.
There are thousands of refugees facing difficulties during this winter season. I can feel their pain because I have lived the same situation. Last year, it was damn cold [in the camps], living in the tents.
I was a member of a political party for the [Hazara Shia] community in Pakistan. I had a good life. Why did I escape?
I was under attack [by armed groups]. I decided there was no more hope to live in my city [Quetta].
I knew we would face difficulties [coming to Europe].
The European Union-Turkey deal is against humanity. I feel very sad.
I've lost two years of my life - if anyone gives up two years of their life, it's a very valuable amount of time. I could've done many things.
The only problem here is the financial crisis and the job opportunities are very low; not only for the refugees but also for the Greek people.
My expectations to find a job are not very high. I've even collected recyclables from the rubbish and tried to resell it. I would stay in Greece if there were opportunities.
I sent my wife to Switzerland. Right now, I'm waiting for reunification to join her.
It's taken two years to get my asylum interview. I'm always thinking of how to get out of this situation.
I want to be independent, stand on my own two feet and have a good future for my children.
But I'm sorry to say it seems like there is no possibility for that in Greece.
A few people here [in Greece] are racist and don't like refugees. Everywhere there are good and bad people.
When I first came to Athens, I was in the Elliniko camp. I lived in a tent with my family for months. It was very difficult for us.
Later, I moved to another camp. Eventually, I got a space here in City Plaza [squat].
The government isn't doing anything but making camps, where it's very cold and bad.
In City Plaza, it's a big change, and they treat the refugees well.
This makes refugees feel like they're in a home. It gives us hope that we can still fight.
It's a good place, safe for the children, it's clean and we get food. It's much better than the camps.
I wish the Greek government and the EU would open up the empty buildings for refugees living in the camps.
Karime Qias, 17, recently left Lesbos with her family, arrving in Athens [Patrick Strickland/Al Jazeera]
Karime: We camped outside the [municipality] for several nights [to protest in Lesbos]. We had a lot of NGOs coming to talk to us [in Lesbos], but they didn't do anything for us.
They are using [refugees' cases] for funding. But they didn't find us a place for us to live [outside of the camps].
There were also lawyers who saw us sleeping outside, but nobody helped.
Every night [in the camps] there was fighting. Many people have [developed] mental health problems.
The Greek government has created a situation where refugees [of different nationalities] fight each other.
They divide us by category, culture, language - this is a political game.
Shafiqa: When we were in Lesbos [for three months before coming to Athens], we had to fight for everything. Every day the situation was getting worse for refugees in [Lesbos]. We learned what the political fight meant.
We didn't think that Europe was like this. We do not want to stay in Greece. We are very happy that we left Lesbos, but we want to continue [to elsewhere]. Maybe we could go to Canada, or if not, Finland.
We have many hopes for the future.
Wherever we end up, we want to find a home for our family.
I promise that this time next year you will find us in a much better place.

The bill passed early on Tuesday and stipulates that two-thirds support is needed in the Israeli parliament, the Knesset, before Israel can relinquish control over any portion of the holy city to a foreign entity, according to local media.
The bill is widely seen as intended to make it more difficult to give up part of Jerusalem to the Palestinian Authority, which wants the city's eastern half to be the capital of an independent Palestinian state.
The bill, backed by Israel's ruling right-wing coalition, was passed with 64 Knesset members voting in favour and 52 against, according to the Haaretz newspaper.
Saeb Erekat, secretary general of the Palestine Liberation Oragnisation's executive committee, said the bill would ""destroy"" hopes for a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
He went on to blame the US for the move, saying it was the outcome of a decision by President Donald Trump to recognise Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, according to the Palestinian news agency Wafa.
Trump also said he intended to move the country's embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.
The decision prompted widespread condemnation and protests in the occupied Palestinian territories and around the world. In a non-binding resolution, the United Nations General Assembly declared the US move ""null and void"".
The legislation also seeks to remove Palestinian neighbourhoods from the jurisdiction of the current Jerusalem municipality, affecting two Palestinian areas - Kufr Aqab and the Shuafat refugee camp - that are already on the other side of Israel's separation wall and are systematically neglected, the report noted.
Most Palestinians in Jerusalem hold permanent resident status, not Israeli citizenship, and their status can be revoked at any time for multiple reasons, forcing them to leave the city.
Israel has revoked nearly 15,000 Palestinian residency permits in Jerusalem since it took control of the city in 1967, Human Rights Watch estimates.
""The new Jerusalem law is a race law; it's a law meant to cleanse Jerusalem of its Arab residents,"" Israeli legislator Esawi Freige said during the vote on the bill, according to Haaretz. ""After the Israeli government chose to erect a wall within Jerusalem, now it is seeking to remove 100,000 of its residents from the city.""
Israel took control of the entirety of Jerusalem after its victory in the 1967 war. It later annexed East Jerusalem in a move that remains unrecognised by the international community.
Palestinian leaders seek East Jerusalem as the capital of a future state, while Israel says the city cannot be divided.

The teenager was detained on December 19, four days after the video showing her confronting the soldiers outside her family's home in the village of Nabi Saleh went viral.
The incident occurred moments after Israeli forces had shot Ahed's 15-year-old cousin point-blank in the face with a rubber bullet.
The wounded minor experienced severe internal bleeding and was put in a medically-induced coma for 72 hours.
Ahed's 20-year-old cousin Nour, who also appeared in the video, as well as her mother Nariman, were arrested soon afterwards.
During a hearing on Monday at Israel's Ofer military court near Ramallah, Ahed faced 12 charges, including assaulting an Israeli soldier, interfering with a soldier's duties and two past instances of stone-throwing, according to her lawyer Gaby Lasky.
Lasky told Al Jazeera that Nariman was charged with ""incitement"" for uploading the video on social media, as well as another charge of assault.
The lawyer said that Ahed and Nariman's charges include older incidents unrelated to the video.
Nour was charged on Sunday with allegedly assaulting a soldier and interfering with a soldier's duties, said Lasky.
The Tamimi family are well-known activists in Nabi Saleh.
While this is the first time Ahed has been detained by Israeli forces, Nariman has been arrested at least five times in the past.
On Thursday, Manal Tamimi, who is related to the women, was also arrested during a demonstration outside the Ofer detention centre demanding the release of her relatives and Munther Amira, another prominent Palestinian activist from Bethlehem's Aida refugee camp who was arrested last week.
Lasky said that she was able to secure the release of Nour and Manal - who has not been charged with a crime. However, the Israeli army's prosecutors have until Tuesday to appeal the decision.
Ahed's father, Bassem, told Al Jazeera that it was very likely his daughter would be sentenced and imprisoned over the charges.
""They built the case around her specifically to try to keep her in prison as long as they can,"" he said.
""I am very worried about my daughter,"" added Bassem, who has also been arrested numerous times by Israeli forces.
""Her fate is now in the hands of people who don't even see Palestinians as full human beings.""
Lasky told Al Jazeera that owing to the charges against Ahed, ""there's a possibility of her facing a lot of time"".
She noted that Palestinian teenagers typically face about six to nine months in prison for charges of stone-throwing.
Prisoners' rights group, Addameer, has reported that stone-throwing is the most common charge levied against Palestinian children. In the occupied West Bank, where Palestinians are governed by Israeli military law, stone-throwing is punishable by up to 20 years in prison.
The group says that Israel routinely targets ""the youngest and most vulnerable"" members of politically active Palestinian families to ""exert pressure on their family and the entire community to put an end to all social mobilisation.""
Bassem told Al Jazeera that Israel is attempting to ""break Ahed because she is a symbol of the resistance"".
""Israel wants to show other young Palestinians what will happen to them if they try to resist.""

The decision of US President Donald Trump to recognise Jerusalem as the capital of Israel has generated a series of reactions in Palestine and around the world.
Here are the latest developments, both on the diplomatic and street front, as of Sunday, December 24:
Israeli forces respond to Friday protests on Gaza-Israel border with live ammunition, injuring 20-year-old Jamal Mosleh, who died of his wounds a day later, on December 30.
Turkey's Prime Minister Binali Yildirim and Saudi Arabi's king Salman bin Abdulaziz have said the Islamic world should ""act with unity"" against the US decision to recognise Jerusalem as capital of Israel. During a meeting in Riyadh on Wednesday, the two said the Muslim world should remain united to protect the rights of Palestinian ""brothers"", according to a statement from the Turkish prime minister's office. Both Turkey and Saudi Arabia have strongly criticised US President Donald Trump's decision.
Palestinian Christian leaders have rejected Trump's decision, describing it as ""dangerous"" and ""insulting"". The US move is offensive to ""Christians and Muslims around the world who consider Jerusalem as an incubator of their most sacred, spiritual and national heritage"", Atallah Hanna, the archbishop of Jerusalem's Greek Orthodox church, said in a statement ahead of Christmas.
The ministry of health in the Gaza Strip confirmed on Sunday that Mohammed Sami al-Dahdouh, 14, died as a result of wounds suffered during a protest against Israeli soldiers at Gaza's eastern border earlier this week.
Dahdouh's death takes the number of Palestinians killed by Israeli forces since Trump's December 6 announcement to 15.
Bethlehem, normally brimming with tourists at this time of year, has been almost empty of visitors in recent days due to nearby clashes between Israeli forces and Palestinian protesters.
Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has called on ""world Christians to listen to the true voices of the indigenous Christians from the Holy Land ... that strongly rejected the US recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital,"" in a statement ahead of Christmas.
Abbas said the Palestinian Christian community is ""an integral part of the Palestinian people"", and ""the descendants of the first followers of Jesus Christ"", in the statement on Friday.
A 28-year-old Palestinian man died on Saturday, nearly a week after he was wounded by Israeli fire during a protest on the Gaza border against the US official recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital.
Two Palestinians in Gaza have been killed by Israeli forces during protests against Trump's Jerusalem move on Friday.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has called on Washington to reverse its move to recognise Jerusalem as the capital of Israel in line with the UN General Assembly's vote to reject Trump's decision.
Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has announced he will reject any Israeli-Palestinian peace plan proposed by Washington.
""The United States has proven to be a dishonest mediator in the peace process and we will no longer accept any plan from the United States,"" he said, at a meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron in Paris on Friday.
Malysian leader Najib Razak headed a protest involving thousands of Muslims against Trump's decision in the country's capital, Putrajaya, on Friday.
Malaysia will do all it can to save Jerusalem and will not be cowed by the US or quietened by his close ties with US President Donald Trump, the prime minister told demonstrators.
Malaysia was one of the more than 120 countries who voted in favour of a UN General Assembly resolution calling for the United States to drop its recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital on Thursday.
UN General Assembly rejects Trump's Jerusalem move. A resoundingly majority of United Nations member states has defied unprecedented threats by the US to approve a draft resolution rejecting President Donald Trump's recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital.
The non-binding measure passed at a UN General Assembly emergency meeting on Thursday with 128 votes in favour and nine against, while 35 countries abstained.
Gholamali Khoshroo, Iran's UN envoy, said: ""The Israeli occupation lies at the centre of all crises and conflicts in the Middle East and beyond, a fact which has long been acknowledged at the UN.
""The appalling tragedy and the old wound of our region in the past 100 years which began with the conspiracy of the Balfour Declaration has entered a new phase with the politically incorrect, illegal and unlawful promise of the US president to move the American embassy to the Holy City of al-Quds [Jerusalem].
""We strongly condemn this reckless unilateral act by the US to distort the historical facts and replace them with fiction.""
Danny Danon, Israel's ambassador to the United Nations, told the body's General Assembly: ""This resolution only encourages more violence and instability…. We know that Jerusalem is sacred to billions around the world. Israel respects all religions and encourages everyone to visit and pray in the holy city.
""I have no doubt that today's resolution will also end up in the trash bin of history. I have no doubt that the day will come when the entire international community will finally come to recognise Jerusalem as the eternal capital of the state of Israel.
""The arguments about the president's decision to move the American embassy to Jerusalem have already been made. They are by now well known… The decision does not prejudge final status issues, including Jerusalem's boundaries,"" she added.
""The United States will remember this day in which it was singled out for attack in the General Assembly for the very act of exercising our right as a sovereign nation.""
Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said at the emergency UN General Assembly meeting on Jerusalem: ""For so many times, we have came here to say the Palestinians have the right to live like the rest of us; they have the right to be free and secure; they have the right to prosperous; and they have the right to enjoy what is their own. Yet our words couldn't make a change. The illegal occupation continues. And Palestinians cannot enjoy their basic rights…
""Turkey will never let al-Quds [Jerusalem] down. The Palestinian people will never be left alone.""
Turkey, Palestine lash out at US threats. President Erdogan told the United States on Thursday it could not buy Turkey's support, ""I hope and expect the US won't get the result it expects from there (UN).""

EU report outlines Israeli settlement developments. ""The E1 plan would entail a severe breach of contiguity between East Jerusalem and the West Bank. Primary among these developments, in addition to demolition orders in the Bedouin village of Khan al-Ahmar, located near E1, are reports of advancement of the northernmost section of the Eastern Ring Road, which would facilitate access to the city for settlers northeast of the city while carrying Palestinians from Ramallah to Bethlehem without entry into Jerusalem"" the report issued on Friday reads.
E1 (""East 1"") is the name the Israeli Ministry of Housing and Construction designated to a 12 square kilometre block of land between East Jerusalem and Ma'ale Adumim, within the jurisdiction of Ma'ale Adumim. E-1 borders on the towns of Anata, Abu Dis, Al'Eizariya and Az -Za'ayyem, all located just beyond the eastern border of the Municipality of Jerusalem.
According to the report, There are currently approximately 208,000 Israelis living in East Jerusalem.
Arab MPs meet in Morocco. Heads of Arab parliaments convened on Thursday in Morocco to coordinate their action following Trump's Jerusalem decision.

They also agreed to ""make all efforts"" to set up headquarters for the Palestinian Legislative Council in the city of Jerusalem.
Lebanese embassy in East Jerusalem. ""The government has decided to form a committee, headed up by Prime Minister Saad Hariri, to study proposals by Foreign Minister Jubran Bassil to open a Lebanese embassy in Jerusalem,"" Information Minister Melhem Riashi announced following a Thursday cabinet meeting.
In his announcement last week, Trump said his administration had yet to decide on ""the specific boundaries of Israeli sovereignty in Jerusalem"".

A website promoting Hungary's presidency of the Visegrad group, comprising the Czech Republic, Poland, Slovakia and Hungary, has published the agenda of ""The Future of Europe"" meeting.
Yiannopoulos, the keynote speaker, is expected to address the ""challenges of the Western World"" in Budapest on January 23.
A former technology editor at the far-right Breitbart news outlet, Yiannopoulos achieved notoriety in 2015 after making a series of statements supporting anti-feminists.
The conservative provocateur adheres to a ""West is best"" mantra, taking a stance against immigration and refugees.
He once told a radio host that if Australians allowed 12,000 Syrian refugees to stay in their country, it would result in their ""daughters being raped"".
Hungary's Fidesz government, led by President Viktor Orban, also takes a hardline stance against refugees. The country is being sued by the European Union for refusing the bloc's mandatory quota to accept asylum seekers, as part of efforts to resettle arriving refugees more equally across the continent.
For Zoltan Pogatsa, a Hungarian political economist and expert on European integration, Yiannopoulos is a clear choice, due to his anti-refugee rhetoric.""In the last two or three years [Fidesz has] basically been running this kind of ideology. [It is] critical of refugees coming from Islamic countries.""
The EU is also suing Poland and the Czech Republic for low refugee resettlement.
Along with Slovakia, the countries have been protesting against the EU refugee resettlement scheme. In September, the European Court of Justice dismissed their challenge.
Yiannopoulos' anti-refugee rhetoric ""fits into the ideas of the entire region"", Pogatsa said.
Cas Mudde, expert in European far-right movements
The origins of the Visegrad group, or V4, lie in a 1991 summit after the fall of the Soviet Union. The summit took place in Visegrad, a Hungarian city on the border with Slovakia.
The countries, three at the time due to still-unified Czechoslovakia, agreed to military, cultural, economic and energy cooperation.
All four nations joined the EU in May 2004.
The choice of Yiannopoulos did surprise some, however, including Cas Mudde, an expert in European far-right movements and professor at the University of Georgia.
""The inclusion of Milo is impossible to understand, as he is a flamboyant, openly gay internet troll, whereas Fidesz tries to sell itself as a conservative, pro-family values party,"" Mudde told Al Jazeera.
Yiannopoulos is a homosexual who married his long-time partner, a black man. In spite of this, he has frequently spoken out against LGBTQ rights, including same-sex marriage.
Scott Long, an activist focused on LGBTQ rights, tweeted: ""Neofascist Viktor Orban enlists gay fascist Milo Yiannopoulos to keynote a conference of the Visegrad Group ... The horrors never stop.""
Yiannopoulos lost a book deal with a reported $250,000 advance after a video surfaced in which he appears to endorse child sexual abuse.
Gotz Kubitschek, a German philosopher, nationalist and member of the ethnocentrist European Identitarian movement, with ties to the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, will also speak at the January event.
Mudde was unsure Yiannopoulos and Kubitschek would be well-received by the other three V4 members.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia are not so closely related to the ethnocentric far-right.
The Polish government is ruled by the conservative Catholic Law and Justice party, whose members have a history of anti-LGBTQ statements.
They ""will despise [Yiannopoulos] and be wary about a German nationalist"" as Poland was invaded by Nazi Germany in 1939, Mudde said.
Al Jazeera contacted the Hungarian government for comment but it did not immediately respond."

The move on Saturday came hours after a Greek administrative committee ruled in favour of the man's appeal against his earlier application for asylum.
The committee's ruling angered neighbouring Turkey, which has repeatedly called for the soldiers' extradition, accusing them of having a hand in the putsch bid.
In a statement, Turkey's ministry of foreign affairs called the decision politically motivated and warned that it would affect ties between the two countries.
""Greece failed to show the support and cooperation we expect from an ally in the fight against terrorism by preventing criminals who took part in killing hundreds of Turkish people and targeting the democratic order,"" the statement said, according to a translation in Turkish newspaper Daily Sabah.
Later on Saturday, the Greek government said that it had filed an appeal against the decision by the administrative committee for asylum requests.
Athens said in a statement that its move was in line with ""its standing position regarding the eight soldiers, as it has been repeatedly and publicly expressed"".
Greece's administrative court of appeal will now look into the case.
Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras has previously said his country does not support coup plotters and that its justice system is independent.
The decision on Saturday was not taken by a judicial committee, but an administrative one. It is comprised by two administrative judges of the Greek justice and one representative of the UN's refugee agency, according to Stavroula Tomara, one of the soldiers' lawyers in Greece.
The eight soldiers fled Turkey in a military helicopter and landed in the Greek northeast town of Alexandroupolis during the failed coup on July 15, 2016.
The attempted coup against Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's government left more than 240 people dead.
In its ruling on Saturday, the Greek asylum committee ruled that there was no evidence to prove the officer had participated in the attempted putsch, media in Greece reported.
The tribunal is still considering the cases of the other seven fugitive soldiers.
Tomara, the lawyer, welcomed ""the excellent, unbiased, impartial Greek judges for their courage and their [bravery] to take such a decision without being driven by any political interests"".
Speaking to Al Jazeera from Athens, Tomara said ""the grounds for this decision [is] that the soldiers have not participated in any kind of coup"".
She said she expected the other seven soldiers to be granted asylum in their cases, as well, which are still pending.
Turkey has repeatedly called on Greece to extradite the officers, but the country's Supreme Court rejected Ankara's extradition request in January.
Up until now, the Greek government had said it could not intervene in the case and must respect the will of the judiciary.
The issue has led to increased tension between Athens and Ankara.
Erdogan himself made a request for the officers' extradition earlier this month during a meeting with Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras.
The Turkish government has accused Fethullah Gulen, a US-based Muslim cleric, of orchestrating the coup. Gulen denies the charges.

The Human Rights Centre of the University of California at Berkeley recently reported that Israel's security forces have carried out a ""widespread"", ""frequent"" and ""indiscriminate"" use of tear gas against Palestinian refugees in Aida refugee camp near Bethlehem.
The report - said to be the first to analyse the effects of tear gas in the West Bank - found that 100 percent of the more than 200 Palestinian residents surveyed in Aida camp were exposed to tear gas over the past year.
The report, No Safe Space: Health Consequences of Tear Gas Exposure Among Palestine Refugees, collected testimonies last summer in Aida and the nearby Dheisheh refugee camp.
""We found that the constant and unpredictable use of tear gas in Palestine refugee camps has a devastating effect on the mental and physical health of residents,"" said the report's co-author, Dr Rohini Haar, a researcher at the UC Berkeley centre and a doctor with Physicians for Human Rights.
The effects, Haar told Al Jazeera, are especially harmful on ""the most vulnerable, including pregnant women, children, the elderly, and people already in ill health"".
The report surveyed 236 residents of Aida, all of whom said they were exposed to tear gas in the last year.
Of that, 84 percent of people said they were exposed while in their homes.
As its name implies, tear gas is intended to cause a person's eyes to water and skin to burn.
Residents also told the report's authors that the Israeli army's use of tear gas was ""primarily unprovoked"".
The Israeli army did not respond to Al Jazeera's request for comment on the study's findings at the time of publishing. However, in a statement sent to Al Jazeera on Thursday, it said it ""will examine the report and draw the relevant conclusions if needed"".
Refugee camps are among the most vulnerable to tear-gas exposure in the occupied Palestinian territories, the report states.
Home to about 6,400 Palestinian refugees, Aida covers just 0.017 square kilometres, making it one of the most densely populated places in the world.
Clashes between Israeli security forces and Aida camp residents are frequent, with the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) estimating that at least 376 confrontations took place between January 2014 and December 15 of this year, the report stated.
""Our life here in the camp is filled with tear gas, filled with stun grenades, filled with skunk water,"" said 30-year-old resident Sabreen, the mother of a Palestinian prisoner, referring to a foul-smelling liquid frequently sprayed by the Israeli army on Palestinian protesters and homes across the West Bank.
""It is the life of a refugee. What can we do?"" added Sabreen, who did not give Al Jazeera her last name.
Two years ago, an Israeli soldier was filmed warning the camp's residents: ""People of Aida refugee camp, we are the occupation forces. You throw stones, and we will hit you with gas until you all die. The children, the youth, the old people - you will all die.""
Firing tear gas near homes violates the UN Code of Conduct and the UN Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials, the report stated.
It also explained that homes and schools are not designed to shield against tear gas, leaving residents with few options to avoid it or reduce its effects.
Last Friday, Al Jazeera saw the Israeli army fired hundreds of tear-gas canisters into a small crowd of protesters in an area bordering Aida camp. Limited clashes also spread into the camp, where Israeli soldiers responded with more tear gas.
""I came back home from a wedding, and I found 25 gas canisters near my home,"" said Sana, a resident of the camp, who also did not give Al Jazeera her last name.
Many residents of the camp have taken to wearing gas masks to protect themselves, though they are difficult to obtain and costly.
According to Dr Haar, regular exposure to tear gas can affect ""all [the] body['s] systems"".
In the report, residents described various physical effects from such frequent exposure to tear gas, including losses of consciousness, miscarriages, trouble breathing, asthma, coughing, dizziness, rashes, severe pain, allergic dermatitis, headaches, neurological irritability and even blunt trauma from being hit by tear gas canisters.
""Everybody's system is affected by this,"" Dr Haar said.
The Israeli army's frequent use of tear gas has also had left residents with psychological scars.
Because of the random nature of the Israeli raids, Aida camp residents find them themselves ""perpetually on edge, fearing the next attack"", according to the report.
Amal Manasra, 27, a resident of Aida, told Al Jazeera her infant daughter was recently exposed to tear gas after a canister fired by the Israeli army landed near a door to her home.
""The oxygen level was zero ... She was suffocating ... We carried her to the hospital ... She spent seven days there,"" Amal said.
""We are in an area we are exposed to shootings daily, to smelling tear gas. I have kids. The gas leaks into the house through windows and from under the door,"" she said.
Dr Haar told Al Jazeera that ""no one else experiences this level of tear gas"".
The protests against US President Donald Trump's recent recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital have increased Palestinians' exposure to tear gas, the study found.
Meanwhile, Palestinians have also alleged that the gas has become more potent.
""This is not tear gas; it is poison,"" Thaer, another Aida camp resident, told Al Jazeera.
While tear gas is usually composed of a mixture of synthetic or naturally occurring gases, including pepper spray, ""the specific chemical utilised by the [Israeli security forces] in recent years is unknown"", the report stated.
According to Dr Haar, ""the Israeli government is obligated to disclose the composition of the tear gas"" it uses so medical professionals can treat the symptoms the chemicals cause.
Meanwhile, Chris Gunness, UNRWA spokesperson, said the ""report raises serious concerns about the use of tear gas in heavily built-up areas such as the refugee camps in Bethlehem"".
""The widespread, indiscriminate and frequent use of tear gas exposes refugees including our own staff to health risks, but at this stage, it is impossible for health professionals to fully assess these risks and the long-term impact of prolonged and regular exposure,"" Gunness told Al Jazeera.
""It is clear that the psychological impact on young people surveyed is significant and that the development and educational prospects of children are being affected.""

To many Palestinians, a structure that has brought pain and suffering to their lives has become, for all practical purposes, a source of excitement and fantasy for tourists staying at the hotel.
When the sun sets and the hotel guests turn in their spray paint for the night, some Palestinians tiptoe around the area to add their own touches to the wall by defacing the art on the concrete. The hotel was established earlier this year by the British street artist Banksy, who reportedly said at the time that it was ""the world's only visitor attraction dedicated to the biography of a single concrete structure"". The hotel's website boasts ""ceiling views of graffiti-strewn concrete"" and proximity to an Israeli army watchtower.
The rooms overlook Israel's separation wall and are decorated with objects meant to represent Israel's violence against Palestinians.
The central activity for the hotel's guests is decorating the wall with art and graffiti.
Beside the hotel is a shop called ""Wall Mart"" that sells graffiti products to tourists eager to scribble their names on the most visual component of Israel's more-than-half-century occupation of the West Bank.
However, many Palestinians express disappointment with what they see as the hotel's role in ""occupation tourism"" in Bethlehem, which they believe has transformed Palestinian realities into recreation for tourists.
Amany Khalifa, a prominent Palestinian activist based in Jerusalem, told Al Jazeera, ""The wall has become a product. It has become exotic and sexy for internationals.""
For some Palestinians, words are clearly no longer enough; it is time for action.
A particular target has been Melbourne-based street artist Lushsux, accused by many Palestinians of ""profiteering"" during his stays at The Walled Off Hotel and creating images that speak to the alt-right.
During a recent defacing campaign, 25-year-old Palestinian activist Soud Hefawi sprayed the lines ""I do not need a colonialist to teach me how to fight colonialists"" and ""Some people like to benefit from other people's misery"" across Lushsux's meme-style murals on Israel's separation wall.
A mural by Lushsux of Joe Rogan, an American comedian, had featured a text bubble asking: ""Can you pull up that picture of me on the illegal border wall?""
Hefawi swiftly defaced it by writing ""This is not a border wall. It's an apartheid wall"" and ""Palestine is on both sides of the wall"".
The wall, which was declared illegal by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) more than a decade ago, divides Palestinian communities, splits families and separates residents from their lands.
The structure's total length is expected to be 712km on completion.
According to the Israeli rights group B'Tselem, 85 percent of the wall is being built inside the occupied Palestinian territory, leading many Palestinians and rights groups to conclude that the wall's construction is aimed at annexing more Palestinian lands.
Khalifa told Al Jazeera The Walled Off Hotel has taken wall tourism to an altogether new level by ""exoticising Palestinian trauma"".
At the Walled Off Hotel's shop, you can find small, souvenir recreations of the separation wall, in which Lushsux painted ""Make Kebabs, Not Hummus"".
The price of one of these limited-edition souvenirs is $341.
""This tourism is minimising the whole occupation and making it into a product for internationals to buy,"" Khalifa said.
""Issa"", a local Palestinian artist who told Al Jazeera he was behind the ""Make Hummus, Not Walls"" graffiti and asked to use a pseudonym to protect his identity, began creatively poking fun at The Walled off Hotel from its inception.
He began with defacing his own art, and scribbled ""Welcome to the shopping mall"" over his own graffiti.

His ""Make Hummus, Not Walls"" graffiti was ""supposed to be a stupid pun and a stupid joke ... but then the image began being reproduced by others"", he said.
But the popularity of the graffiti contributed to the ""fetishisation"" of Palestine, ""Issa"" says with evident regret.
A few days later, ""Issa"" and his friends wrote, ""Wanksy will save the world"" and #Mam7onE7tilal (Horny for the occupation) in front of the hotel's window.
While the former was quickly covered up by the hotel, the hashtag remained for two months.
""We wrote the hashtag in Latin letters so that Arabs wouldn't read it and the foreigners wouldn't understand it,"" Issa said with a chuckle.
""Issa"" said the hashtag alluded to the hotel's promotion of ""conflict fetishisation"", in which Palestinians and their suffering are reduced to celebrated symbols, devoid of the larger political realities shaping their lives.
While a long line of graffiti artists did come before Lushsux to take advantage of the international spotlight on Israel's separation wall, Hefawi, the Palestinian activist, told Al Jazeera, Lushsux's artworks went too far.
He saw them as racist and anti-Semitic.
""I just felt like enough was enough,"" Hefawi said, explaining why he decided to deface Lushsux's murals.
For her part, Khalifa told Al Jazeera the artwork of Lushsux and the activities of The Walled Off Hotel escaped criticism due to a long-standing process of ""internationals disempowering Palestinians"", referring to international control over what is deemed legitimate Palestinian resistance.
""Palestinians have been put into a position where we have to make internationals understand the situation, without making them feel uncomfortable,"" Khalifa said.
Hefawi agreed, saying that ""for years, foreigners have not been challenged about their activities here.""
""It's not very surprising that now we have a tourist promoting racism on the wall and thinking he will go unquestioned,"" he said.
""Issa"" pointed out that Lushsux has created images of the Swedish YouTuber PewDiePie - who has in the past been accused of racism and anti-Semitism.
Lushsux's social media posts suggest he had considered painting wealthy Jewish investor George Soros, whose image is often used by far-right groups to promote anti-Semitic conspiracy theories.
In response, Issa and some friends defaced the artist's memes on the separation wall by daubing the words ""Alt-Right Propaganda"" over them.
""I wanted to make sure [Lushsux] knows that Palestinians are not stupid,"" Issa said.
Robert Andrews, an activist and advocate for Palestinian rights from the US who took part in the defacing campaign, wrote ""Palestine is not your drawing board"" in Arabic over some of Lushsux's murals and almost entirely covered up two of the artist's pieces with a pink paint-roller.
Lushsux did not respond to Al Jazeera's requests for comment. He has referred to the defacement of his artwork as ""Israeli modern art masterpieces"", despite being informed on multiple occasions that Palestinians and US activists had problems with his work.
A man presumed to be Lushsux reportedly told Reuters news agency in October that he hoped his artwork on the Israeli separation wall would draw attention to Palestinians stuck in ""an indoor prison"".
Wissam Salsa, the Palestinian owner of The Walled Off Hotel, said the hotel has little to do with solidarity.
""Most people who come to the hotel are not coming in solidarity. They are mostly Banksy fans, so they have no idea what's going on here,"" he told Al Jazeera.
Still, he acknowledged that the hotel was established to ""communicate with people and raise awareness of the realities in Palestine"".
A central aspect of this is the hotel's emphasis on its guests painting graffiti on Israel's separation wall in order to create a ""physical attachment between the internationals and the wall"", Salsa says.
""It's a way for them to express their protest against the wall and the injustices behind it.""
Several guests at the hotel agreed with Salsa's sentiments, telling Al Jazeera they believed they were contributing to the local Palestinian economy by spending money in Bethlehem.
However, locals, who did not want to give their names, told Al Jazeera most tourists seldom leave the hotel.
One guest at the hotel told Al Jazeera he had been working on a project with Lushsux to create an inflatable bouncy castle for children, designed to resemble the separation wall complete with Israeli observation towers.
They had planned to take it around the West Bank for use by children in refugee camps, and then transport it to the UK for a tour of music festivals to ""raise awareness"" about the occupation.
Khalifa, the Jerusalem-based Palestinian activist, said purported awareness campaigns run the risk of ""dehumanising"" Palestinians.
""This is our life. This is not an exotic game,"" Khalifa told Al Jazeera.
""We don't have the privilege of writing on the wall, and then going home and never having to see this wall again. We are forced to see it every day.""
""Issa"", the Palestinian artist, considers the ""normalisation"" of the wall's image as the most dangerous side effect of foreign tourism and the Walled Off Hotel.
""The more we reproduce images of the wall, the more the wall becomes normal in people's imagination,"" he told Al Jazeera.
""Then our imaginary stops at the wall. It becomes the first subconscious image of Palestine.""
He said the proliferation of the wall's image has also created illusions of a border, something that he claimed Lushsux specifically attempted to promote.
""Israel wants to show the world that there is a wall, as a border. It perpetuates other narratives that are to the benefit of the occupier, and the occupier's quest to downgrade the occupied as sub-humans,"" he said.
Palestinians have also expressed concern over the potential for wall tourism to create a vested interest in the structure's permanence.
Referring to the famous list of international sites deemed by UNESCO as having special cultural and physical significance, ""Issa"" said: ""Soon, we won't even be able to take this wall down because someone will tell us it's World Heritage.""

The International Rescue Committee (IRC) said unless interventions are ""urgently funded"", the humanitarian needs of children will only increase.
""Education in emergencies is a life-saving and life-changing intervention - helping children recover and cope with the continuing adversity they face,"" said Sarah Smith, the IRC's senior director for education, on Friday.
""This is incredibly urgent for Rohingya children; no one is paying attention to their needs, and they face some of the highest levels of trauma the IRC has ever seen.
""Until children's rights to education in the Rohingya crisis are realised, we face the threat of a lost generation of what is already one of the world's most vulnerable populations.""
Less than two percent of humanitarian funding goes towards education, the most underfunded sector in response to the Rohingya plight, the IRC said.
Evan Schuurman, part of the Save the Children's emergency response team in Cox's Bazar, said in October that schooling was particularly important for traumatised refugee children.
""School isn't just about learning,"" he wrote in a piece published by Al Jazeera. ""It provides routine and a sense of normality, a place where children can make friends, play and remember what it's like to be children.
""It's also a critical form of protection from exploitation and abuse, such as trafficking.""
According to the Oxford Burma Alliance, a student-run organisation at Oxford University, more than 60 percent of Rohingya children between the ages of five and 17 have never been to school due to poverty, government restrictions on their movement, and a lack of schools in Rakhine State, Myanmar.
More than 620,000 Rohingya have fled to neighbouring Bangladesh since August 25 in fear of abuses by Myanmarese soldiers, which the United States and UN described as ""ethnic cleansing"".
The ongoing crisis has been described as the biggest forced exodus of 2017.
Bangladesh and Myanmar signed a deal last month for the return of hundreds of thousands of Rohingya refugees, but little is known of its details.

The noisemakers, two 17-year-old Afghan refugee girls, are riding horses for the first time in their lives.
Once a week since early October, young Syrian, Afghan and African refugees from camps and shelters across Athens have been brought to the United Pony Caravan to ride and care for horses as part of an equine therapy programme for refugee children stranded in Athens.
The United Pony Caravan, a privately funded organisation, was founded by Joffrey Debut and a small group of horse riders and trainers from France, aiming to help refugee children heal.
In October 2017, Debut and several trainers drove from France to Greece with half a dozen horses and ponies in a trailer hitched to the back of their truck. In the ensuing months, Debut has been giving horse-riding lessons - and life lessons - to hundreds of refugee children.
""I try to use them [horses] as a link - a link for education, a link for respect, a link for values,"" Debut told Al Jazeera. ""They are a tool. Of course you can get something from horses, but before all of that, it is a tool to make a relationship with these children.""
Jason Podimatas, operations manager at the Home Project, a privately funded organisation giving shelter to unaccompanied minors in Athens, noted: ""These horses give love with nothing in return, and this is exactly what these kids don't have and what we are trying to give them ... All kinds of animals have therapeutic benefits for kids.""
Since 2015, more than one million refugees from the Middle East and North Africa have landed on Europe's doorstep, most entering through Greece and Italy. Fleeing war, persecution and economic devastation, many aim to continue on to central and northern Europe within days or weeks of their arrival.
But after last year's ratification of a treaty between the European Union and Turkey - which stated that all refugees and migrants arriving in Greece would be returned to Turkey in exchange for increased resettlement of Syrians within the EU from Turkey - and the closure of the Macedonian border in northern Greece, an estimated 50,000 refugees and migrants from the MENA region have been left stranded, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).
Earlier this year, Human Rights Watch released a report documenting the ""deteriorating mental health of asylum seekers and migrants - including incidents of self-harm, suicide attempts, aggression, anxiety, and depression"". For children, the stakes are even higher.
According to data from the National Center for Social Solidarity, around 9,600 unaccompanied refugee minors have registered in Greece since the beginning of 2016. More than 2,000 still lack adequate shelter.
Amid this backdrop, various individuals and organisations have come together to brainstorm alternative therapy programmes, such as the United Pony Caravan. The Home Project regularly brings children to take part in equine therapy here.
At a recent session, Zehra and Maryam, who asked that their last names not be published, lead their horses out of the stable and begin the process of cleaning them. They shriek anytime the horses make eye contact with them, but eventually their curiosity gets the better of them.
""I come here because I love horses and I love riding,"" Maryam told Al Jazeera. ""In Afghanistan I thought about it a lot, but I never went ... No girls in Afghanistan go for riding; it's not common, but now that I have the chance, I will use this chance.""
With the horses tied to the fence, Debut shows the girls how to properly brush them, comb their tails and attach the saddles. Once mounted, the girls are led through a maze of dirt paths crisscrossing through vineyards and gardens until they reach the arena where Debut runs them through the basics of steering and stopping. By the end of the two-hour lesson, both girls are at a full gallop, their initial fear gone.
""If you cannot manage yourself, you cannot communicate with a horse, so the first thing that you learn with a horse is to manage yourself,"" Natasa Skoufi, a horse trainer and social worker for Doctors Without Borders, told Al Jazeera. ""They feel their power and they love to do it. When you see your own power, and that you can manage with an animal like this, you gain your self-confidence.""
Sofia Kouvelaki, executive director of the Home Project, said the goal is also to help children overcome mental-health issues, with many suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder.
""All of them have either witnessed violence or have experienced violence themselves, so there's a lot of trauma,"" she said.
""We've had victims of rape, victims of trafficking, sexual exploitation, physical abuse and depression that has been caused by the really bad conditions that these kids have experienced ... There's a lot of trauma that needs to be healed. Through the equine therapy, we've seen the difference, even from the first session.""

While data from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) shows a decrease in the number of refugees registered in Serbia - from approximately 7,900 in March 2017 to 4,448 as of December 10 - Doctors Without Borders (MSF) reports that hundreds of people are still stranded.
""Almost 500 people are sleeping rough between Belgrade and border areas,"" said Andrea Contenta, a humanitarian adviser for MSF, noting that ""freezing temperatures will expose them to huge risks"".
Citizens from Afghanistan account for more than half of the refugees registered in government-run centres, followed by Pakistanis, Iraqis and Syrians. But last year, a growing influx of Cubans became stuck in Serbia amid enhanced border controls, including two walls built by the Hungarian government.
Travelling by plane to Russia, where they can enter without a visa, citizens of the Caribbean island continue their trip to Montenegro, Macedonia or Serbia. In these former-Yugoslav republics, they can still receive a 30- to 90-day tourist visa upon arrival, a vestige of old diplomatic ties.
Once in Belgrade, Cubans hope to cross into nearby European Union countries and eventually reach Western Europe. But their dreams have been dashed by the same razor wire and police patrols that have transformed Serbia into ""a huge buffer zone for Europe, where refugee rights are usually ignored"", said Rados Durovic, director of the local NGO Asylum Protection Center.
Data from the Belgrade Center for Human Rights shows that 92 Cubans expressed the will to seek asylum in Serbia in 2016. A total of 168 were hosted in some of the 18 government reception centres as of January 2017, according to the International Organization for Migration. Over the year, that number fell to just over a dozen, according to UNHCR.
Al Jazeera spoke with several Cuban refugees about their journeys.
During an interview with a TV channel in 2016, I expressed some criticism towards the government. I thought it was normal. I love Cuba but I wanted to share my feelings on the conditions of people of African descent like me. After this, somebody came looking for me. I received some threats and had to hide.
Given difficulties to reach the US, especially for a single mother with a kid, I decided to look for safety in Europe. My mother and my older sister came with me, together with my son
When we reached Serbia, it was freezing cold. We needed a place to stay and a government officer sent us to Dimitrovgrad, a small city close to the border with Bulgaria, where a new camp was being opened.
It was like being in the middle of nowhere, but we thought that soon we would move to a better place. Little Matteo and Michael familiarised with the many Syrian and Iraqi children there, and this made it easier for them. For us, adjusting to this new life where nobody could speak Spanish was a challenge.
Months after, we decided to move to a camp closer to the border with Hungary. Every day the Hungarian police allow 10 people to enter their territory. When our turn came, the police put us in a huge container with hundreds of people, inside an area surrounded by fences.
There, they will assess our claim: If they accept us, then we will finally access the EU. I am so afraid that at times I cannot sleep at night.
What brought me here? The need to build a new life. I was born and raised in Havana's old city, where I had a business, my room and my motorbike. But there were problems. My parents are in Florida, and I hoped to reach them. Entering the US had become too difficult, so I sold my motorbike and bought a ticket to Montenegro.
From Podgorica, I took a train to Belgrade. The first few months were the hardest: I didn't have a place to stay and I joined thousands of people sleeping in barracks along the Sava river. Most were Afghans, accustomed to such cold. For me, it was unbearable. I started getting sick.
At that point, I asked my father for help. He sent me money and for one month I could pay for a room in a guesthouse. Once the money ran out, I was back on the streets. That's when I decided to apply for asylum in Serbia. As a Jehovah's Witness, I started attending a local church group. Even if we could hardly understand each other, they made me feel welcome, and this convinced me to stay.
For the last five months, I've been at the Krnjaca refugee centre, on the outskirts of Belgrade.
I'm the only Cuban in the camp, and life is not easy. Moreover, Serbian culture is different, as were my expectations. But thanks to a psychologist, I was able to overcome this stress and think of a positive future.
I am a transgender; that's why I escaped from Cuba. The country is changing rapidly, but there's still a widespread macho culture, and discrimination is everywhere. As a trans person, you're harassed when you walk in the streets and are stopped by police if you go out at night. You cannot live a normal life, have a normal job ... Sometimes prostitution becomes your only choice.
I couldn't resign myself to this. I wanted to be myself and live freely. Just like many others, I had hoped for reaching the US. The so-called ""wet feet, dry feet"" policy, which allowed Cubans that set foot on American soil to pursue residency, was repealed by the Obama administration last January. Right afterwards, Trump strengthened controls at the Mexican border, and prices asked by ""coyotes"" - the smugglers - got higher.
When I arrived in Serbia, I tried to ""play the game"", what many young refugees call the attempt of illegally crossing borders. Croatian police caught me. I still have signs of their beatings.
Serbia doesn't seem to be the best place for a trans person, and neither is the camp of Principovac where I am staying right now. Afghan and Pakistani guests look at me as if I was an alien. But I have a friend, a lady from Somalia. She looks at me and asks, ""Are you a man or a woman?"" I stare back at her, and we both start laughing.
To be perfectly honest, this situation is suffocating. I know that countries in Western Europe can give me real protection and help me with hormone therapy. I desperately need to leave Serbia.

Turkey's state-run aid agency, the Turkish Cooperation and Coordination Agency (TIKA), has been distributing meals - often rice, lentils, chicken curry and potatoes - to Rohingya refugees here since mid-September.
Every day, 2.5 tonnes of ingredients are used to feed about 25,000 Rohingya, an ethnic minority group, hundreds of thousands of whom were forced to flee Myanmar earlier this year amid a deadly crackdown at the hands of the country's military.
TIKA has also distributed 10,000 blankets, provided medical care and built the only playground for Rohingya children in the camps.
The governments of Turkey and Bangladesh did not always enjoy such a close relationship. But the Rohingya crisis has changed that.
""There were times when we were sitting on ... rice and lentils for days as there was no firewood to cook,"" said Innasur Alam, a refugee in Kutupalong camp.""
Pointing to a TIKA-run food distribution point, Alam said: ""They started giving us cooked meals then.""
Earlier this week, Binali Yildirim, Turkey's prime minister, described the killing of Rohingya by the Myanmar military a ""genocide"".
Yildirim, who made the comments on a two-day visit to Bangladesh, helped hand out some of TIKA's meals himself, while also inaugurating a medical facility at Balukhali refugee camp in Cox's Bazar.
Turkey also donated two ambulances to the local district administration.
TIKA was the first foreign organisation to deliver foodstuffs and medicine - an initial shipment of 1,000 tonnes - to the conflict zone of Rakhine state in Myanmar on September 2.
After the violence erupted there in late August, the Myanmar government blocked all UN aid to the area.
Turkish Disaster and Emergency Management Authority (AFAD) and Turkey's Religious Affairs Directorate are also providing aid and medical care in Rohingya refugee camps in Bangladesh.
Yildirim is one of several Turkish policymakers and senior figures who have made high-profile visits to Bangladesh since the Rohingya crisis broke out in August.
Emine Erdogan, spouse of Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Turkey's president, visited the camps in September, alongside Mevlut Cavusoglu, Turkey's foreign minister, and Fatma Betul Sayan Kaya, the Turkish family and social policy minister.
Erdogan himself was the first world leader to condemn the Myanmar army for applying a disproportionate use of force to remove the Rohingya from Myanmar, calling it a ""textbook case of ethnic cleansing"".
As the incumbent chief of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), Erdogan gathered Muslim leaders across the world in applying pressure on Myanmar to stop its attacks on Muslim-majority Rohingya.
He also raised the Rohingya issue at the UN.
Turkey has played an ""initial key role"" to draw international attention to the plight of the Rohingya, explained Imtiaz Ahmed, a professor of international relations at Dhaka University.
Ahmed said this is part of the Turkish government's wider push to defend Sunni Muslims against oppression around the world.
Turkey's ""overwhelming support on Rohingya issue"" is part Erdogan's effort to become the ""leader of the Muslim world"", Ahmed told Al Jazeera.
""[Turkey's] stance on the Rohingya issue definitely gives them an edge.""
Ties between Turkey and Bangladesh became particularly strained over a war-crimes trial in which top leaders of Bangladesh's largest Islamist party, Jamaat-e-Islami, were hanged.
Erdogan condemned the execution of Motiur Rahman Nizami, the 73-year-old head of the party, who was hanged in Dhaka on May 11, 2016, and accused European leaders of ignoring the case because Nizami was a Muslim.
Turkey also reportedly recalled its ambassador to Bangladesh, Devrim Ozturk, at the time. Three months later, however, Ozturk came back to Dhaka.
Last year, Ozturk thanked the government of Bangladesh for ""expressing its support to Erdogan’s government after the failed coup attempt"" in Turkey on July 15.
Officials at Bangladesh's ministry of foreign affairs and the Turkish embassy in Dhaka declined to comment on whether the Rohingya issue had healed the rift between the two countries.
But a high-ranking official in the ministry, who spoke to Al Jazeera on condition of anonymity, said Bangladesh and Turkey ""want to forget what happened"" around the war-crimes trial.
The countries ""plan to focus on strengthening their bilateral relationship"", the official said.
With the most prominent war-crimes trials now over, ""Turkey is not concerned or bothered about it any more"", said Munshi Fayez Ahmed, chairman of the Bangladesh Institute of International and Strategic Studies (BIISS).
Ahmed told Al Jazeera he believed Turkey's strong support for Bangladesh on the Rohingya issue has ""definitely helped the two countries to improve what was perceived to be a frayed relationship"".

Thursday's agreement, which is expected to go into force on December 24, calls for an unconditional end to the violence and unhindered access for aid workers to all areas throughout the country.
Signed in the Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa, the ceasefire aims to revive a 2015 peace deal that collapsed last year after heavy fighting broke out in Juba, Reuters news agency reported.
Thousands of South Sudanese have fled the civil war in their homeland, only to become internally displaced or to seek shelter in refugee camps in northern Kenya.
But despite facing difficult conditions in the camps and with little to call their own, the ceasefire announcement from Addis Ababa is small comfort to thousands of South Sudanese civilians.
Helen Gune's husband and brother were among those killed in the South Sudan fighting. She now takes care of her brother's eight children, as well as five children of her own.
""It's very hard for me. I'm the only person now to take care of these children. I don't know whether peace will come or not. I'm not hopeful any more,"" Gune told Al Jazeera at the Kakuma refugee camp in northern Kenya.
South Sudan has been mired in violence since a political rift between President Salva Kiir and his former Vice President Riek Machar erupted into full-blown war in late 2013, shortly after the country gained its independence.
Thousands of people have been killed, and more than four million people have been displaced from their homes as a result of the fighting, according to UN figures.
Anadolu news agency quoted Moussa Faki, chairman of the African Union Commission, as saying that signing the ceasefire was ""just a small first step"".
""The real test of the seriousness of your commitment will reside in your commitment to take practical action,"" Faki said.

In December, the trend peaked with Austria becoming the only European country to bring the far right into government.
Several parties have exploited discussions about immigration, Islam and the role of the European Union, considering them a threat to security, to win support, from France to Poland.
We have a new government and #Austria's police as well as its army will be under the control of Austria's far right party FPÖ. Including all secret services. And on top the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. - Am not sure if the rest of the world has already noticed this.
""The far right didn't put immigration on the agenda, the refugee crisis did that,"" said Cas Mudde, an expert on far-right politics at the University of Georgia. ""If we didn't have a far right we would have been talking about immigration and Islam, but they have had a very important [role] on how we talk about those things.""
Far-right movements, he said, are defined by ""nativism, authoritarianism, and populism"".
""Brexit and Trump set up 2017 as the year of populism and the radical right,"" he told Al Jazeera. ""There's still this broad understanding that radical rights are flash parties - they come out of nowhere, get big success, shake up the system and then disappear - that is empirically just not true for a lot of them.""
Pietro De Matteis, Stand up for Europe vice president
This year, the far right heavily influenced mainstream parties, which feel threatened by the growth of populist parties.
""When mainstream parties take over the agenda of the radical right, even if they don't implement the policies, they are saying the concerns are legitimate,"" said Mudde.
As the far right celebrated gains, tens of thousands protested as xenophobic politicians and their supporters gathered in conference halls, campaigned at rallies and marched through cities. And with much hate speech spread online, in December, Twitter deleted accounts belonging to far right movements.
But are these efforts satisfactory to remove this dangerous strain?
With elections to continue in Europe in 2018, change is needed, said Pietro De Matteis, vice president of the pan-European citizens' movement, Stand up for Europe.
""Europe has to reform, and reform around and with the citizens. I hope 2018 is the time when this will start,"" he told Al Jazeera.
Below, we review the year.
Leaders of Europe's far right, including Marine Le Pen of France's National Front and Geert Wilders of the Dutch Party for Freedom (PVV), convened in Germany's Koblenz on January 21 under the auspices of Europe of Nations and Freedom (ENF) - the smallest political group in the European Parliament.
At least 3,000 protested against xenophobia as the meeting took place.
Speakers hailed the election of US President Donald Trump and Britain's Brexit vote as victories for their cause.
In his campaign, Trump repeatedly railed against immigration and Muslims, while Britain's vote to quit the EU was seen by far-right supporters as a step towards stricter border control.
Le Pen told attendees: ""In 2016, the Anglo-Saxon world woke up … In 2017, I am sure that it will be the year of the Continental peoples rising up,"" she said.
In Hungary, Janos Ader was re-elected as president on March 13.
He is a member of the ruling conservative Fidesz party, which has shifted further right, in part due to a campaign against billionaire investor and philanthropist George Soros, whose Open Society Foundations (OSF) charity advocates for greater acceptance of refugees and migrants.
In the Netherlands, the March 15 general election saw Geert Wilders' PVV party win the second-largest share of votes with more than 13 percent overall and a five-seat gain on the 2012 election. Mark Rutte, the Dutch prime minister, held on to his role.
""Some people read the result as a defeat for the populists, but it was the opposite,"" Daniele Albertazzi, a lecturer in European politics at the University of Birmingham. ""The key is to what extent they have influenced other parties, which in the Netherlands they have.""
Mudde agreed. ""The success of the radical right is in agenda setting ... Who then implements that agenda is less relevant, just the fact that it's done,"" he said.
France's National Front leader Marine Le Pen made it to the second and final round of the French general election on May 7.
The party took more than 10 million votes - a record performance - but Emmanuel Macron won with 66 percent.
""He won without giving in to the far right,"" said Mudde. ""In a certain way Rutte won in the Netherlands ... by adopting the policies, and even the discourse of the radical right.""
Germany's Alternative for Germany (AfD), which promised to ban all mosques and criminalise wearing the veil, emerged as the country's third biggest political force, winning 12.6 percent of the popular vote on September 24.
Angela Merkel's centre-right Christian Democratic Union party secured 33 percent, down almost nine percent from the 2013 ballot.
""Had Merkel scored 3 or 4 percent more we would all be talking about the end of populism and the new energy of liberal democracy,"" Mudde told Al Jazeera.
Angela Merkel is still trying to form a coalition government.
Austria's Freedom Party (FPO), led by Heinz-Christian Strache, won 26 percent of the vote, becoming the third largest party, in the country's October 15 election.
It entered government in December, forming a coalition with 31-year-old Chancellor Sebastian Kurz and his Austrian People's Party.
Both parties campaigned for tougher immigration rules and the deportation of asylum seekers.
""There is nothing new in the success of these parties,"" said the University of Birmingham's Albertazzi. ""But there are opportunities for them now that have been generated by the impacts of globalisation, the refugee crisis and many terrorist attacks in Europe.
""Those [developments] have accelerated a process that was taking place anyway.""
In the Czech Republic, the anti-Islam Freedom and Direct Democracy party won 538,574 votes, or nearly 11 percent, and became a new parliamentary party.
Chaired by Tomio Okamura, a Czech-Japanese politician, the party has links with Le Pen's National Front.
In December, the party hosted Europe's far right in Prague, where leaders called for a Europe without the EU.
Some 60,000 people, including nationalists and fascists, took part in Warsaw's Independence March on November 11.
The demonstration carried a clear anti-Islam and anti-EU message.
Pietro De Matteis, Stand up for Europe
""We know that politics led by extremists is a recipe for disaster,"" said Matteis of Stand up for Europe.
""We have had two world wars in the last century; we don't want conflict again ...Together we need to draft a new vision for the future of Europe, batting the problems people see as only being addressed by the populists.""

Although Israeli officials promised to limit contact with ministers of the Freedom Party of Austria (FPO), rights groups fear any involvement at all with the far-right populist outfit that advocates anti-Muslim, anti-refugee, anti-immigration and Eurosceptic policies could normalise xenophobia.
The FPO is a junior partner in Austria's coalition government, headed by the right-wing People's Party (OVP).
On Monday, Israel's foreign ministry released a statement in Hebrew saying Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government ""will maintain working relations with the professional echelon of the government ministries headed by a minister from the Freedom Party"".
The statement also said Israel intends to ""limit"" contact with ministries headed by FPO politicians and reaffirms its commitment to the struggle against anti-Semitism.
The OVP's Sebastian Kurz, the new chancellor, said on Tuesday that he respects Israel's decision, Haaretz reported.
Israeli politicians, such as parliamentarian Yehuda Glick and former legislator Michael Kleiner, are among those who advocate maintaining regular ties with the far-right party.
""Boycotting them because of their past is like boycotting Christians because of the Inquisition,"" Glick told Israel's Army Radio, as reported by the Times of Israel.
Farid Hafez, political scientist
Farid Hafez, a political scientist and research fellow at Georgetown University's Bridge Initiative, told Al Jazeera that it ""is worrying to see groups in Israel cooperating with right-wing extremists"".
""Since 2005, the FPO has systematically focused on Muslims as the new scapegoats, and we can observe a shift also by the so-called mainstream parties to the right,"" he said, explaining that the FPO had previously targeted Africans, Turkish immigrants and former Yugoslav refugees.
""Although [the FPO] pretended to have left behind anti-Semitism, many of its politicians from the lower ranks are regularly standing out with anti-Semitic statements.""
Established in 1956, the FPO's inaugural leader was Anton Reinthaller, a former Nazi functionary during World War II and a member of the SS paramilitary.
Nadia Hijab, executive director of Al-Shabaka: The Palestinian Policy Network, said Israel's decision to maintain ties with the new Austrian coalition ""comes as no surprise"".
""Israel has nurtured relations with anti-Semitic, right-wing countries and movements in Europe, such as in Hungary, either remaining silent or overlooking their use of anti-Semitic tropes,"" Hijab told Al Jazeera.
The Hungarian government, headed by far-right Prime Minister Viktor Orban, has been accused of recycling anti-Semitic tropes in its ongoing campaign against philanthropist and billionaire George Soros, who it claims has tried to encourage immigration to undermine ""Christian Europe"".
""This is outrageous in and of itself, and ironic when it comes from a country claiming to be a safe haven for Jews worldwide - a country established at the expense of colonising and dispossessing an entire people,"" Hijab added, referring to Israel's occupation of Palestinian lands.
""But Israel's alliances with right-wing movements and countries in Europe has significance far beyond the Palestinian question,"" she continued.
""In order to legalise its occupation, Israel needs to undermine the system of international law that was consolidated in the wake of World War II - a system that the Europeans are especially attached to as protection from war on their continent.""
In July, FPO leader Heinz-Christian Strache announced his support for recognising Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.
Although Israel has maintained that Jerusalem is its capital for decades, the international community has overwhelmingly rejected that assertion on the grounds that Israel has occupied the eastern part of the city since the June 1967 Middle East War.
The Palestinian Authority, the West Bank-based governing body, maintains that East Jerusalem is the future capital of a Palestinian state.
""Given that in Jerusalem are located the state president's office, the prime minister's office, most of the governmental ministries, as well as the Knesset - it is totally absurd not to locate our Austrian Embassy in Jerusalem, as we do in other capitals of other countries all over the world,"" Strache said at the time.
US President Donald Trump announced his decision to recognise Jerusalem as the capital of Israel on December 6.
Strache has also expressed his support for Israel's construction of Jewish-only settlements in the occupied West Bank, which are considered illegal under international law.
When the FPO first joined an Austrian coalition government in 2000, Israel recalled its ambassador to the country and downgraded the relations between the two countries.
Jamal Zahalka, a Palestinian legislator in Israel's parliament, the Knesset, noted similarities between Netanyahu and the far right in Austria, and elsewhere.
""In fact, many Israeli ministers are more extreme than the far right in Austria,"" he told Al Jazeera.
""The Israeli right is pushing for strong relations with those parties because they support Israel … and because the ideology is the same. Israel is an inspiration to extreme right-wing parties all over the world - from Europe to India.""
Zahalka argued that Israel ""doesn't care if the extreme right is against refugees, immigrants and Muslims so long as they are no longer openly anti-Semitic"".
He added: ""For us [Palestinians], the struggle against racism, Islamophobia and anti-Semitism are the same.""

The three-month-old child, known only by his first name, Karim, lost his left eye and suffered wounds to his skull in the attacks on the besieged Damascus suburb of Eastern Ghouta.
A portrait of Karim by the Syrian refugee artist, Fares Jasem, which shows a rose covering the child's scars, helped raise social media awareness about the boy's plight, with some describing him as a symbol of the suffering children in Syria have undergone since the civil war started in 2011.
Activists launched a number of hashtags in solidarity with Karim, including #SolidarityWithKarim and #StandWithKarim.
#StandWithKarim #SolidarityWithKarim #EasternGhouta @AlabedBana @SyriaCivilDef pic.twitter.com/dFxJkjRUFR
As the social media campaign took hold, Twitter users posted pictures of themselves with a hand covering one eye.
Those taking part included Bana al-Abed, a Syrian refugee who rose to international prominence for her tweets and video blogs from the city of Aleppo during the fighting between rebels and government troops there in 2016.

Others included the British permanent representative to the UN, Matthew Rycroft, who featured in a photo published by the British Foreign Office covering one eye.
Speaking at the UN on Tuesday, Rycroft said Russia should use its influence over the Syrian government to help the entry of food and other supplies into Eastern Ghouta, as well as allowing the evacuation of the injured.
""It's just a thirty minute journey from Eastern Ghouta to Damascus to receive treatment,"" he said, adding: ""It really is a matter of life and death.""

Turkey's deputy prime minister, Hakan Cavusoglu, also weighed in on the campaign, emphasising his country's opposition to the Syrian government over the targeting of civilians.
""While the world was playing three monkeys over Syria, Turkey always stood by (babies like) Karim, as well as other oppressed people,"" he said.

Karim's image is not the first image of a child victim of Syria's war to go viral and drum up such outpouring of sympathy.
In August 2016, the image of a boy, plucked from the rubble, sitting expressionless in the back of an ambulance after an air raid in Aleppo, became emblematic of the Syrian government's campaign of aerial bombardment.
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based monitor of Syria's war, puts the total number of casualties from Syria's war at around 500,000 people.

Thousands of schools have been forced to shut their doors. Bustling neighbourhoods have been completely abandoned. And buildings which stood proud for centuries have been reduced to rubble and dust.
Yemen, described by the Romans as the most blessed region in the Arabian peninsula, is on the brink of collapse after 1,000 days of a vicious civil war.
Since March 21, 2015, when a coalition led by Saudi Arabia went to war with Houthi rebels, more than 10,000 people have been killed and more than three million have lost their homes.
In just 11 days in December, 136 people died as a result of intensified air raids by the Saudi-led military coalition.
Famine threatens the lives of millions of survivors as the coalition continues to enforce a debilitating blockade on northern ports of the country, depriving large areas of food, fuel, and medicine.
""Death and destruction are the first things to greet you when entering Saada province,"" said Hisham Abdullah, a 27-year-old father of two and resident of Saada city.
Bombs have ravaged the impoverished region, which borders the Kingdom.
""You could be at home sleeping, walking to the shops, playing football with your children, but at any moment a Saudi air strike can take you out,"" he said.
""Even dogs don't dare walk the streets.""
Once a city of around 50,000 people, Saada has turned into a ghost town, with more than 2,996 coalition strikes pulverising the Houthi stronghold.
""Some may say we are crazy to have stayed, but what else are we to do, where do we go?"" Abdullah said.
""We have seen how the Syrians are suffering in refugee camps - our fate would be the same if we left.""
For 1,000 days, Yemen, the Arab world's poorest country, has been embroiled in a regional proxy war, with the Saudi-led coalition attempting to oust Houthi rebels - widely believed to be backed by the Kingdom's regional rival, Iran - from power.
Amid widespread internal displacement and destruction, some 14 million people - over half of them children - do not have access to clean water and sanitation.
""People are selling their belongings in order to feed their children,"" said Saif Saleh al-Oliby, a freelance photographer based in the capital, Sanaa.
""I can't find work and no one in my family earns a salary. The blockade has made an already bad situation worse,"" he told Al Jazeera.
Coalition forces, attempting to roll back advances made by the rebels, have imposed a crippling blockade on areas under their control, obstructing food, water and humanitarian assistance.
According to residents, the cost of food and fuel has skyrocketed, with soaring inflation leaving the poorest most vulnerable.
""The price of flour has more than doubled since November,"" Ayham Alghopari, a student at Sanaa University, told Al Jazeera.
""You can no longer buy car petrol on the open market, the price has more than doubled. It used to cost YR4,000 ($16) to fill up a small car; it now costs YR9,000 ($35).""
Before the war, Yemen imported around 90 percent of its wheat and all of its rice to feed its population of about 28 million. Around 70 percent of these imports passed through rebel-held Hodeidah.
But imports have since plummeted, leaving millions unsure of when their next meal will come.
""People are simply unable to buy food,"" a UN official said on condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to talk to media.
""The price of food has gone up by more than 30 percent since early November. More than seven million people are now at acute risk of famine.""
The Houthis seized control of large parts of Yemen in late 2014, after President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi postponed long-awaited elections and stalled negotiations over a new constitution.
Exploiting widespread anger against Hadi's decision to cut fuel subsidies, the rebels marched south from Saada province to Sanaa, surrounding the presidential palace and placing Hadi under house arrest.
Concerned by the rise of the rebels, the coalition launched a massive air campaign aimed at reinstalling Hadi's government.
Saudi Arabia intensified its embargo on Yemen in November, closing all land, sea and air ports after Houthi rebels fired a ballistic missile towards the capital, Riyadh.
The Kingdom said the blockade was a necessary precaution aimed at preventing weapons being smuggled into Yemen by Iran.
Lutf Alsanani, 25, Sanaa resident
Tehran again rejected allegations of arming the Houthis, calling them ""malicious, irresponsible, destructive and provocative"".
The Kingdom eased the blockade three weeks later, but has repeatedly refused to allow commercial imports through Hodeidah - a Red Sea port city which provides a lifeline to the Houthis - at the demand of dozens of aid groups such as Doctors Without Borders, Oxfam and UN agencies.
""I'm learning to live without electricity,"" Lutf Alsanani, a 25-year-old Sanaa resident, told Al Jazeera.
""I don't have access to clean water, gas, cooking oil, and I haven't received my salary in a year.
""In 1,000 days, Yemen has become a land of blood and bombs. This place is hell on earth.""
Data compiled by the Yemen Data Project, released in December, revealed that nearly a third of all coalition air strikes since the start of the war hit civilian sites including schools, hospitals and mosques.
The study found that out of the 15,489 air raids recorded from March 26, 2015 to December 15, 2017, 386 struck farms, 212 hit schools, 183 hit marketplaces, 44 hit historical buildings and 44 hit mosques.
Manal Alwesabi, a 30-year-old resident of Hodeidah, said since coalition forces advanced, life had taken a dramatic turn for the worse.
""The situation in Hodeidah is really bad, but it's far worse in neighbouring villages.
""People are fleeing from one place to the next, trying to find safety, but life has become so difficult that we've come to accept our fate.
""We hoped that this war would end soon, but that hope is gone. We're all alone, facing one disaster after the next.""

The move came a day before British MPs, who are part of the Home Affairs Committee, were set to discuss the role social media plays in influencing hate crime.
Accounts and posts made by the group were deleted on Monday as part of the social media network's updated policy to combat ""hateful conduct and abuse"" on the platform.
Trump was slammed in late November after he retweeted three anti-Muslim posts by Fransen.
The retweets earned rare rebuke of the US leader from British Prime Minister Theresa May.
So @Twitter finally suspend Britain First - the day before social media cos appear at @CommonsHomeAffs .Why does it take a Parliamentary hearing to make them do the right thing? https://t.co/WcpCJ1IMlE
""Britain First seeks to divide communities by their use of hateful narratives that peddle lies and stoke tensions. They cause anxiety to law-abiding people,"" May said in response to the incident.
At least one of the tweets shared by Trump, a still from a video purportedly featuring a Muslim migrant assaulting a Dutch teenager, was called out as false.
Dutch media outlets pointed out that the perpetrator of the assault was neither a Muslim or a migrant, as claimed by Fransen.
Trump's promotion of Britain First material led to renewed calls among Twitter users for the platform to take action against racial and religious abuse.
Purged from Twitter so far: - Hunter Wallace (League of the South) - Michael Hill (League of the South) - Jayda Fransen (Britain First) - Paul Golding (Britain First) - Jared Taylor - American Renaissance - Traditionalist Worker Party
Fransen and Golding's were among several far-right and white supremacist accounts suspended by Twitter this week, which appeared to come as a result of the platform's updated policy.
On Monday, Twitter began enforcing new rules regarding individuals and groups that promote hateful and other abusive behaviour ""on and off the platform"".
""Accounts that affiliate with organisations that use or promote violence against civilians to further their causes"" will be in violation of the platform's policies, Twitter said in a statement.
It said it was cracking down on ""content that glorifies violence or the perpetrators of a violent act"" and any account that ""abuses or threatens others through their profile information"".
Twitter also said it would not tolerate hateful imagery, which includes ""logos, symbols, or images whose purpose is to promote hostility and malice against others based on their race, religion, disability, sexual orientation, or ethnicity/national origin"".
Others accounts affected by the crackdown included US-based groups, such as Vanguard America and the American Nazi Party.
Britain First continues to operate on Facebook, where it has almost two million likes and continues to share objectionable content.
A Buzzfeed report in late 2016 showed how the group had paid Facebook thousands of pounds to get its content promoted on user timelines.
Twitter suspends hate preachers and Britain First leaders Paul Golding and Jayda Fransen. All I want to know is what took them so long? But it's better late than never!!
The group's vast online following, however, has not translated into bigger crowds at the anti-Islam protests it organises, which usually draw only a few dozen supporters.
Britain First came to prominence in the UK after the murder of the MP Jo Cox in the week preceding the June 2016 referendum to leave the European Union.
The opposition Labour party politician was a vocal supporter of immigration and refugee rights and had been campaigning for the UK to remain in the bloc when she was stabbed and shot by a white supremacist.
Her killer, Thomas Mair, was heard shouting ""Britain first"" by witnesses.

Satellite images of Myanmar published by Human Rights Watch (HRW) on Monday revealed destruction in 40 Rohingya villages since October.
""The Burmese army’s destruction of Rohingya villages within days of signing a refugee repatriation agreement with Bangladesh shows that commitments to safe returns were just a public relations stunt,"" said HRW Asia director, Brad Adams.
The organisation said the number of completely or partially destroyed Rohingya villages since Myanmar began its campaign targeting the largely Muslim ethnic group now stood at 354.
Citing evidence, HRW said villages may have been targeted as recently as early December, despite a Memorandum of Understanding signed between Myanmar and Bangladesh to allow Rohingya refugees to return home in late November.
Images of Maungdaw Township in Rakhine State showed the razing of buildings at some point between November 25 and December 2.

In August, the Burmese military launched a military campaign ostensibly targeting Rohingya armed groups, but which the Rohingya people, rights groups, journalists, foreign states, and the UN have said is targeting ordinary civilians.
Rohingya refugees who have fled to neighbouring Bangladesh have shared accounts of destroyed homes, rapes, and mass killing.
The HRW report comes as the UN Commissioner for Human Rights, Prince Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein, reiterated his belief that what was happening to the Rohingya could amount to genocide.
He told the BBC that the perpetrators of abuses against the ethnic group could one day be brought to trial in international courts.
Myanmar's civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi may not be excluded from possible future proceedings, he said.
More than 600,000 members of the Rohingya community have fled to Bangladesh, where they live in enclosed camps.
The group has long been the target of discriminatory practices in Myanmar, including the withdrawal of citizenship rights and lack of access to state services.

Some 244 million people worldwide are migrants - approximately 20 million of whom are refugees. The migrant population is greater than the number of people living in Russia, South Africa and Saudi Arabia.
Since 2000, the number of migrants has risen by 41 percent.
In 2013, journalist Paul Salopek began retracing an ancient path of human migration from Africa for his ""Out of Eden"" project.
The journey from Ethiopia will see him cover 21,000 miles on foot - including across the Middle East, Asia, and North America.
He hopes to complete the trip at the southern tip of South America, Tierra del Fuego, sometime around 2020.
Al Jazeera spoke to Salopek about what it means to be a migrant today.
Al Jazeera: What can your project ""Out of Eden"" tell us about migration?
Paul Salopek: Movement and migration has been a defining human quality since the birth of our species in Africa some 200,000 years ago. Or, based on more recent fossil evidence, maybe as far back as 300,000 years ago.
Some scientists speculate that we began to walk upright partly due to drying climates thinning out the African forests that we evolved in as apes. We started walking to get from one ever-more-widely-spaced tree to another.
By standing on our hind legs we gained a slight tactical advantage with grasslands predators because we could see them coming from afar. We could plan ahead by seeing far away.
In any case, fickle environments always reward mobility. If a drought or famine comes you can walk away.
This axiom applies with a vengeance in modern times. There are more people on the move today than at any time since World War II.
And whether we stay put or travel, all this migration eventually touches us because now we are bound together more than ever before through global forces like economics, climate change and wars that trigger huge refugee displacements.
Al Jazeera: Which experiences have defined your walk so far?
Salopek: The experience of generosity. I wouldn't have made it this far without it.
Al Jazeera: What drives migration?
Salopek: When we dispersed out of Africa the main push factors probably were climate change, resource depletion and territorial disputes due to overpopulation. The main pull factors were following the food. That meant following massive animal herds.
Nowadays, the push factors are escaping mass violence or finding a job to feed a starving family.
Not much has changed, except that borders have replaced glaciers as the main barriers along the way.
Al Jazeera: Will humans always have an urge or need to migrate?
Salopek: I think the urge to move is coded in our DNA. Subsequently, this also got coded into our cosmology. It's hard to find a religion that doesn't involve some sort of a journey.
We didn't stop wandering when our ancestors stepped onto a beach in Tierra del Fuego about 7,000 years ago. That's the last corner of the continents that archeologists say was colonised by our kind.
We simply aimed for the moon after running out of new horizons.
Al Jazeera: Do you reflect on the privilege being an American citizen gives you, in terms of the access your nationality grants you?
Salopek: I'm hugely privileged ... I'm conscious of it, and try to be sensitive to it.
More important, being a man has circumscribed my narratives about women's lives, because I simply can't fully access those stories, especially in conservative rural communities. In response, I've begun seeking women guides in those regions to write about their own stories.
I tell readers that there are more than seven billion trails on the planet. And I'm just walking one.
Al Jazeera: Is enough being done to protect refugees?
Salopek: [It is] vastly different depending on the refugees' place of departure and destination.
Turkey has accommodated more than a million Syrian refugees in humane ways that puts the rest of the world to shame - because it simply had to.
Unless you rapidly and rationally integrate such huge numbers of people spilling cross your borders, you invite social upheaval.
By contrast the Africans floating across the Bab-el-Mandeb to the Arabian Peninsula, many of them war refugees from Somalia or elsewhere, were relative orphans.
I walked past their dehydrated bodies left to rot in the deserts of Djibouti. They are invisible.

The Trump administration unveiled its national security strategy on Monday, vowing to put the interests of American citizens first on a range of issues, including ""combatting terrorism"", increasing border control, enforcing strict immigration policies, and promoting the US economy.
""The first duty of our government is to serve our citizens, many of whom have been forgotten. But they are not forgotten any more. With every decision and every action, we are now putting America first,"" Trump said in a televised address.
The economy figures largely in the Trump strategy document, which states that economic prosperity must be considered ""a pillar of national security"" and calls for lifting regulations that restrain energy development.
The Trump strategy document pledged to ""pursue peace through strength"".
It named three principal ""challengers"" to this goal: ""the revisionist powers of China and Russia, the rogue states of Iran and North Korea, and transnational threat organisations, particularly jihadist terrorist groups"".
Trump said the US has dealt the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) ""one defeat after another"" - and reclaimed ""almost 100 percent"" of the territory the group once held in Iraq and Syria.
On the threat from North Korea's nuclear weapons, Trump vowed: ""It will be taken care of. We have no choice.""
The president's strategy explicitly named China and Russia as ""competition"" that seek to ""challenge American power, influence, and interests"" and attempt ""to erode American security and prosperity"".
While the US will seek opportunities for cooperation with its rivals, ""we will stand up for ourselves and we will stand up for our country like we have never stood up before"", Trump said in his address.
""America is in the game and America is going to win,"" he said.
Speaking before the strategy was officially released, the Chinese Foreign Ministry said it hoped the document would ""play a constructive role to promote world peace and stability and contribute to Chinese-US strategic mutual trust in ensuring world peace and security"", the Associated Press reported.
Reporting from Washington, DC, Al Jazeera's Kimberly Halkett, said Trump identifying China and Russia was almost like ""returning to a Cold War mentality"".
Halkett called Trump's speech as ""a rambling and disjointed address"" that was ""thin on details"".
""It was a speech further highlighting one of the Trump administration's biggest struggles since taking office: cohesion and foreign policy success,"" said Halkett.
""It's a challenge that appears likely to continue, given the divergent positions of the president's national security plan.""
Phyllis Bennis, a fellow at the Institute for Policy Studies in Washington, DC, said US national security has not been enhanced under the Trump administration.
""I think that this notion of 'America First' has been translated in the Trump era to a very direct choice of war over diplomacy. I think what we're seeing now ... is a renewed focus on defining strategic competitors - particularly Russia and China - in the context of exerting domination over them,"" Bennis told Al Jazeera.
""This is not about protection of people in the US; this is about using economic power really as part of a war strategy,"" she said.
Tarun Chhabra, a fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington, DC, said ""competition is the main theme"" of the president's strategy.
While the Obama administration referred to China both in terms of competition and cooperation with the US, ""here the emphasis really just is on competition, with cooperation as a footnote"", Chhabra said.
According to Chhabra, ""there seems to be a big disconnect with [Trump's] aspirations ... about a relationship with Russia ... and the stark terms in the national security strategy"" that refer to Russia as a competitor.
The US will deepen its cooperation with European allies to ""counter Russian subversion and aggression, and the threats posed by North Korea and Iran"", the security document stated.
In the Middle East, the US will promote a strong Gulf Cooperation Council; deny Iran ""all paths to a nuclear weapon""; and it ""remains committed"" to facilitating a peace agreement between the Israelis and Palestinians.
Trump also dropped climate change from the list of national security threats, after it was first designated as such by Obama in 2015.
""Climate change is an urgent and growing threat to our national security, contributing to increased natural disasters, refugee flows, and conflicts over basic resources like food and water,"" the Obama strategy read at the time.
Instead, the Trump document talks about embracing ""energy dominance"" and allowing energy sources, including coal and natural gas, to stimulate the US economy and promote competitiveness.
""US leadership is indispensable to countering an anti-growth energy agenda that is detrimental to US economic and energy security interests,"" the document states.
According to John Coequyt, director of the Global Climate Policy at the Sierra Club, an environmental group, Trump's decision to remove climate change from the list indicates ""the president is not willing to acknowledge what the entire world understands to be true"".
""I think what this shows is that the president is willing to put his head in the sand and issue documents that try to pretend that this (climate change) isn't a challenge for the world. It is and every other head of state in the world has recognised that,"" Coequyt told Al Jazeera in a telephone interview.
The Pentagon has designated climate change as having an impact on national security for more than a decade, since the George W Bush administration, he explained.
Coequyt said it will in all likelihood continue to do so despite Trump's decision.
Climate change has ""been something that the military has been concerned about for a long time"", he said.
""I think the message is that the president will not ever acknowledge the threat of climate change in any forum and he's willing to even remove it from something as important as our national security strategy.""
The president is mandated by a 1986 US congressional measure to unveil a national security strategy. The first strategy was issued in 1987 by the Ronald Reagan administration.

https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/12/myanmar-urged-free-reuters-journalists-171218143824575.html,refugee,1178,Mon Dec 18 2017 23:07:42 GMT+0000,None,Myanmar urged to free Reuters journalists,"A media watchdog has accused authorities in Myanmar of acts of intimidation against journalists, as it renewed a call for the ""immediate and unconditional release"" of two Reuters reporters arrested last week.
Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo were taken into custody on December 12 after being invited to dine with police officers on the outskirts of Myanmar's largest city, Yangon, according to Reuters.
The news agency said that little is known of the accusations against the pair, other than that they were detained for allegedly possessing classified documents related to Rakhine State, where a brutal army crackdown has forced almost 650,000 Rohingya to flee to neighbouring Bangladesh.
The Myanmar nationals' whereabouts were still unknown on Monday, almost a week after their detention, which has been widely condemned by the UN, human rights groups and a number of foreign governments.
The office of Myanmar's President Htin Kyaw has since authorised the police to proceed with the case against the two reporters, according to media reports on Monday.
In a statement to Al Jazeera on Monday, Daniel Bastard, Asia coordinator for Reporters Without Borders, said Myanmar's government had yet to provide an acceptable legal basis for the two reporters' arrest.
""We still don't know what is the nature of the so-called secret documents the two journalists were allegedly in possession of,"" he said, adding that the authorities' reluctance to ""comment on these documents reinforce our impression that this is all just a pretext to intimidate journalists"".
Myanmar's Ministry of Information last week described the documents as ""important and secret"", saying that they ""related to Rakhine State and security forces"".
It also released a photo of the pair in handcuffs standing behind a table bearing papers, mobile phones and currency, and said they were being investigated under the Official Secrets Act, which was passed in 1923 and carries a maximum prison sentence of 14 years.
Last week, Stephen J Adler, Reuters' Editor-In-Chief, described the pair's arrest as ""a blatant attack on press freedom"", while Antonio Guterres, the UN secretary-general, expressed ""concern"" about ""the erosion of press freedom in the country"".
""Probably the reason why these journalists were arrested is because they were reporting on what they have seen in relation to this massive tragedy,"" he added, referring to the mass exodus of the Rohingya ethnic minority.
Myanmar's military began its violent campaign against the majority-Muslim Rohingya in late August, following a series of alleged attacks by the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army on military posts in Rakhine State.
Fleeing Rohingya refugees accused the security forces of responding with a campaign of arson and murder in a bid to force them out of Myanmar. These allegations are supported by rights groups monitoring the situation, while the UN has called Myanmar's campaign against the Rohingya ""ethnic cleansing"".
The mistreatment of the Rohingya, often described as the world's most persecuted minority, has emerged as the most contentious human rights issue in Myanmar, a South East Asian country making a transition to democracy after decades of military rule.
Zaw Htay, a spokesman for Myanmar's president's office told local media on Monday that Htin Kyaw, a close ally of the country's de facto leader and Novel Peace Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi, had approved the investigation against the two reporters.
""The Ministry of Home Affairs sought permission from the President's Office for the charge,"" he was quoted as saying by the Myanmar Times newspaper.
""With the approval of the President's Office, the charge was filed.""
Reuters said it was not clear if Htin Kyaw or Aung San Suu Kyi had been personally involved in the decision, or if other officials had signed off on the president's behalf.
The International Commission of Jurists (ICJ) has meanwhile condemned Myanmar's use of British-colonial era laws to prosecute journalists. The organisation said Myanmar had invoked such laws in at least three cases against the press this year.
""The abuse of archaic laws like the Official Secrets Act must end,"" Frederick Rawski, the ICJ's Asia Pacific Regional Director, said in a statement on Monday.
""The treatment of these reporters threatens freedom of expression. The harsh penalties they face sends a clear message to other journalists that they could face the same consequences for doing their job,"" he added.
At least 11 journalists have reportedly been detained in Myanmar this year, although some have since been released.
Local newspaper Mizzima, in an editorial on Saturday, added its voice to the chorus of concern saying a civilian government headed by Aung San Suu Kyi had ""raised hopes of a significant improvement in respect for media freedom"".
However, it warned that the case against the Reuters journalists and others ""may severely damage the reputation of a government at a time when it is already facing severe criticism at home and abroad over its handling of the Rakhine crisis"".
The Protection Committee for Myanmar Journalists, a group of local reporters, said on Saturday that its members would wear black in solidarity with Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo.

Journalists and other rights groups in the country and abroad have also taken to social media to express their concern.
Jonah Fisher, a BBC journalist who used to cover Myanmar, criticised Aung San Suu Kyi saying if she ""can't do anything about these journalists - what did she agree to go into govt for?""
I think people get that Suu Kyi can't do much about Rakhine... but if she also can't do anything about these journalists - what did she agree to go into govt for? https://t.co/n43NIKR5W8

Populist politicians from France, the UK, Poland, Austria and the Netherlands wrapped up their gathering on Sunday, held under the banner: ""For a Europe of sovereign nations"".
The conference was hosted by the Czech Republic's anti-Islam Freedom and Direct Democracy party, which won nearly 11 percent of the vote in October and is chaired by Tomio Okamura, a Czech-Japanese politician.
The meeting closed a year of far-right gains across Europe, as demonstrated most recently in Austria.
Members of the Freedom Party of Austria, who were present at the Prague conference, were lauded for having just entered the country's new coalition government.
The National Front's Marine Le Pen, who lost out on the French presidency earlier this year after reaching the final round of voting, said the development was ""excellent news for Europe.
""These successes show that the nation states are the future, that the Europe of tomorrow is a Europe of the people,"" she said.
Along with Dutch Geert Wilders, who leads the Party for Freedom, Le Pen upped a call to unify opposition to the EU under the Europe of Nations and Freedom coalition (ENF) - the smallest group in the European Parliament, launched in 2015.
Closing Europe's borders to asylum-seekers is one of the group's key ambitions.
""Because we like Europe, we say that the EU is going to kill her,"" Le Pen said on Saturday, calling for supporters to help overthrow the union.
""None of us are xenophobic - we are opposed to the EU because we believe it is a catastrophically disastrous organisation.
""Migration is close to unbearable - our respective cultures are being destroyed.
""We do like diversity but I like the Dutch to be Dutch, the Czechs to be Czech, I like the French to be French and I like the Italians to be Italians.""
Geert Wilders, far-right politician
Wilders, meanwhile, rejected Islam as ""totalitarian ideology"" and warned that the continent would be overrun by Muslims.
""We must have the courage to have travel bans as President Trump has done in the United States,"" he told delegates. ""We must have the courage to send every boat with illegal immigrants back as Australia is doing for such a long time.""
He also praised the Czech Republic and the other Visegrad states as ""heroes"" for their continued defiance of EU refugee quotas.
""We want also to remain the masters of our own house,"" he said.
Earlier this month, the European Commission took the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland to the European Court of Justice (ECJ) over their failure to accept their required share of asylum seekers.
The Czech Republic has taken just 12 of the more than 2,000 refugees it was assigned.
""In the regional sense, the post-communist countries are particularly fragile and have always been, with the arrival with the now perceived danger from foreigners and Muslims,"" Jan Culik, a lecturer in Czech studies at the University of Glasgow, told Al Jazeera. ""They have very little immunity to xenophobia and now the Czech Republic and Poland are among the worst in this regard.
""I would say it doesn't bode well for those countries that it is happening in Prague.""
As meetings continued at a hotel, around 400 protestors held peaceful demonstrations against xenophobia.
They chanted ""shame"", blew whistles and booed far-right supporters as they entered the compound, which was heavily fortified with security and police.
""It is important to show people that we are against their actions and what they represent, with their racism and nationalism and hate against people,"" Jan Matustik, a 22-year-old student, told Al Jazeera.
As in neighbouring Poland and Hungary, anti-Islamic and anti-establishment rhetoric has become a mainstay in Czech politics.
Rising populism helped billionaire and Eurosceptic Andrej Babis become Czech prime minister in the last election; he also stands against EU migrant quotas. Earlier this month, Babis told journalists that he insisted on the issue during an EU summit in Brussels.

They have been in the Evros, the river dividing Greece from Turkey, for weeks. And the currents or the fish have taken their clothes.
Sometimes there are personal effects - a pair of glasses, a chain of beads, a bracelet - that can offer a clue to someone's identity.
But usually they remain unidentified, stored here at a hospital morgue in the northeast Greek town of Alexandroupolis - silent witnesses to the horror of a refugee's journey.
""It's very difficult because we have women, we have little boys, girls, we have children,"" Pavlos Pavlidis, a forensic pathologist at Alexandroupolis' general hospital, told Al Jazeera.
The land border between Greece and Turkey, a nearly 200km frontier mostly formed by the Evros, has seen increased traffic since the European Union and Turkey struck a deal to shut down the route into Europe via the Aegean sea.
The UN said Turkish authorities at the land border with Greece intercepted almost 20,700 people between January and September this year, compared to 7,500 reported for the same period last year.
According to the UN's refugee agency, an estimated 4,300 people had arrived this year at the Evros Greek-Turkish land border by the end of October. More than 800 crossed using this route in October alone.
However, attempting to cross Evros can de deadly.
""It was so dangerous, so cold,"" recalled Martin Jafari, an Afghan refugee who said that he lost three friends while attempting to cross the border.
""They were three of my best friends,"" he told Al Jazeera. ""We were out in the open ... We didn't have any food or clothes.""
Al Jazeera's Laurence Lee, reporting from Alexandroupolis, said hypothermia was the cause of many deaths on the Evros. Some of the bodies have been ""discovered by fishermen in the shallows"", or ""in outbuildings, half eaten by wild dogs"".
Refugees are forced into the river because of a double-barbed wire fence on the border, paid for by the EU to keep refugees out, Lee said.
""They cross either in the hands of illegal smuggling gangs or by themselves,"" he added.
""It's really dangerous either way, and yet again exposes the lack of safe routes at the edges of the EU for refugees.""

Mashwra, whose family fled Israeli oppression in the Palestinian territories years ago in hopes of a better life in Lebanon, instead found a dismal economy, international aid shortages and discrimination against Palestinians. He began working full-time to help his family survive.
""I thought, I'll go back to school when I go back to Palestine,"" Mashwra, now 16, told Al Jazeera.
But that hope has dimmed in the wake of US President Donald Trump's statement this month recognising Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. Palestinians view East Jerusalem as the capital of their future state, and the US proclamation - despite being roundly condemned by the international community - has dealt a blow to the estimated 280,000 Palestinian refugees living in Lebanon, many of whom hope to one day return home to Palestine.
Palestinian refugees in Lebanon are treated as second-class residents, restricted from working in most fields, banned from owning property, forced to live in run-down camps and barred from formal education.
Mohamad Jabbar makes $10 a day at his butcher shop, just a tenth of what he could earn if Lebanese authorities allowed him to operate outside the military-guarded camp in Beddawi.
""It's like living in a prison,"" Jabbar said. ""The government controls where I live and where I work.""
Palestinians cannot own businesses in Lebanon and are banned from most decent-paying professions, including medicine and law. An estimated two-thirds live in poverty. The government will not give citizenship rights to Palestinian refugees, for fear it could make them stay forever.
""This is a cruel and false hypothesis,"" Bassam Khawaja, a Beirut-based spokesperson for Human Rights Watch, told Al Jazeera. ""Nothing prevents Lebanon from respecting Palestinians' basic human rights while withholding permanent residency or citizenship. But instead, generations have grown up in limbo, without basic protections.""
Today, Palestinians are competing with nearly two million Syrian refugees in Lebanon for jobs and aid.
""The vast majority of international humanitarian aid coming into Lebanon is focused on the Syrian refugee crisis, which means we are overlooking the long-standing human rights violations that Palestinians have faced here for decades,"" Khawaja said.
The United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) deals with aid for Palestinians, while the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) covers Syrians - and the difference in the aid provided is stark. UNHCR gives 150,000 Syrians in Lebanon $175 a month per family; UNRWA, however, can only give 61,000 Palestinians $10 for each family member every three months, spokespersons told Al Jazeera. Both agencies say they target whoever is considered the most vulnerable.
Unlike Lebanese citizens, Palestinians cannot obtain free treatment at hospitals. They are also barred from most public schools. UNRWA has opened 67 schools and 27 clinics in Lebanon, but the clinics are only for general check-ups, while refugees with serious illnesses, such as cancer, must seek help from other NGOs.
Twelve-year-old Hassan Salem is covered in grease after finishing a 10-hour shift at the local mechanic's shop, as he does every day. At the end of the week, he will get $3.33, all of which goes to his family.
""Of course I want to send my son to school,"" his mother, Lena Deeb, told Al Jazeera. ""But I can't. If he doesn't work, we won't eat.""
Nearly 20 percent Palestinians between the ages of six and 15 - and 30 percent of those aged 16 to 18 - are out of school in Lebanon, often because they are forced to work when their parents cannot. More than 30 percent of Palestinians leave school due to low achievement.
""The schools are so bad, I didn't see a point in going any more,"" said Ali, a 17-year-old Palestinian refugee who asked to withhold his last name. ""I was 14 when I left, and I could barely read or write.""
Nineteen-year-old Mahmoud Mustafa dropped out three years ago. Asked what his dream job is, he laughs: ""We're refugees, we can't dream here. We're just worried about living today.""
Rami Saaf becomes anxious when he is at work - not because he may have to borrow food from his neighbours again to feed his family, but because his kids could be electrocuting themselves at home.
The 34-year-old lives in the Beddawi camp, where raw sewage and water leak onto wires outside his front door. The last time his nine-year-old son touched a wire, he landed in hospital.
Lebanon has 12 refugee camps to house the generations of Palestinians pushed from their homes after the 1948 founding of Israel. Many lack basic services, such as electricity, sewage and waste disposal networks. Seventy-eight percent of households complain of dampness, 62 percent suffer from water leakage, and 52 percent have poor ventilation, according to a UNRWA study.
But this camp is all Saaf knows. Growing up, his dad sold candy on the street, and Saaf never went to school. Instead, he roamed the camp looking for work, which he still does today.
He always dreamed that one day, he would be able to give his kids a better life in Palestine.
""After what Trump said, it's like we died,"" Saaf said. ""We lost hope. I'm sad for the future of my kids. I don't want to have any more kids, because I'll just destroy their future.""
Thousands of Palestinians have held demonstrations across Lebanon over the past week, including one in Beirut on Sunday that turned violent. Protesters threw rocks and set rubbish cans on fire outside of the US embassy, while Lebanese security forces fired tear gas and water cannon into the crowd.
At another protest in the capital on Monday, demonstrators chanted: ""Death to America! Death to Israel!""
""We don't accept Trump's decision,"" Ali said. ""So we will fight.""

""I am passing a message to the Zionist occupation army,"" the 29-year-old double amputee, who lost both of his legs and a kidney in a 2008 Israeli air raid, said.
""This land is our land. We are not going to give up. America has to withdraw the declaration it made.""
Before his death, the wheelchair-bound Abu Thurayyah had become a staple figure at protests along the Gaza Strip's border with Israel.
Since December 6, he and his fellow demonstrators decried US President Donald Trump's decision to recognise Jerusalem as Israel's capital. In photos, Abu Thurayyah can be seen climbing an electricity pole and sticking a Palestinian flag on it.
On December 15, Abu Thurayyah was fatally shot in the head by an Israeli sniper.
Another Palestinian, Yaser Sukkar, was killed the same day while protesting at Gaza's border. Two others were killed by the Israeli army in the occupied West Bank, bringing the death toll since Trump's decision in the first week of December to ten Palestinians.
On Saturday, funerals were held for Abu Thurayyah and the three other Palestinians killed a day earlier.
Al Jazeera's Alan Fisher, reporting from Abu Thurayyah's funeral procession in Gaza, said thousands of people had taken to the streets to pay their respects for ""unlikely figure of Palestinian resistance and defiance"".
""He would often leave his wheelchair at home and attend rallies in protests around Gaza City just carrying his Palestinian flag,"" said Fisher.
""He was carrying that flag when he was shot by the Israelis.""
Ashraf al-Qidra, the spokesman for Gaza's health ministry, said in a statement on Saturday that the Israeli army has been using snipers armed with explosive bullets and indiscriminately firing tear gas canisters.
""The army also uses gas bombs of unknown quality, which has led to the injury of dozens in the form of convulsions, vomiting, coughing and rapid heartbeat,"" he said.
Qidra also noted that Israeli forces have been using excessive violence against civilians and deliberately targeting paramedics, ambulances and news crews.
In April 2008, Abu Thurayyah was sitting with several friends in al-Bureij refugee camp in central Gaza when he was hit by the Israeli air raid that cost him his legs and kidney. Seven people were killed in the attack.
As the sole breadwinner for his 11-member family, which consisted of his two, sick parents, six sisters and three brothers, Abu Thurayyah, who was a fisherman before the Israeli air raid, was forced to find new work to pay the bills for their home in the camp.
He found work washing cars, earning 50-70 shekels ($14-20) a day. Sometimes he also sold vegetables in the market to make ends meet.
In an interview with Shehab News Agency a few years ago, Abu Thurayyah outlined his hopes and dreams for the future.
""I hope one day to own a house,"" he said.
""I wish that people in European and Arab countries will help me after listening to my story to get treatment abroad and prosthetic legs.""

Several European parliament members (MEPs) in the Europe of Nations and Freedom coalition, who rode to power in recent years on the back of growing populism and xenophobia, are expected to be met on Saturday at the venue by hundreds of protesters.
The conference has been organised by Czech-Japanese entrepreneur Tomio Okamura, whose anti-Islam Freedom and Direct Democracy Party (SPD) made unprecedented gains in the Czech legislative elections in October with nearly 11 percent of the vote, good enough to become the third largest party in the Chamber of Deputies.
In addition to members of Le Pen's National Front and Wilders' Party for Freedom, Marcus Pretzell, a German MEP formerly with Alternative for Germany (AfD), is expected to attend the conference along with Janice Atkinson, an independent MEP who was expelled from Britain's populist UKIP party two years ago amid her alleged involvement in a financial scandal. Atkinson was later cleared but one of her assistants subsequently pleaded guilty to fraud.
""Okamura has had contact with Le Pen for several years. This is not the first time they have met, so they are using the conference to build an internal rightwing in Europe and are building contacts with extremists,"" said Jan Culik, a lecturer in Czech studies at the University of Glasgow.
With no other discernible policy, Okamura ran his campaign on the slogan ""No to Islam, no to terrorism"" and has called for an outright ban of the religion in the Czech Republic.
This weekend's conference, at the Top Hotel outside central Prague, remains just as ambiguous, with no clear agenda yet published.
The conference comes as Andrej Babis, who took office as prime minister earlier this week, is the midst of trying to gain influence in a parliament where his ANO party currently holds just 78 seats in the 200-seat lower house and does not have enough support among the other eight parties to form a majority.
Babis is the second richest person in the Czech Republic and has continually railed against the EU's refugee quotas, even after the European Commission said this month that it would take his country to court over their refusal to take in asylum seekers.
""The [European] Commission can withdraw the charge at any moment. We have to negotiate on this and to offer different models, like guarding the borders or help to other countries. But we don't want any refugees,"" Babis said in an interview published earlier this month by Czech daily newspaper Pravo.
With little other support to be found, Babis has shown a willingness to work with Okamura's SPD party and the far-left Communists on a quid pro quo basis by giving them committee posts in return for early votes.
Further adding to Okamura's political clout, Czech President Milos Zeman raised eyebrows last week by delivering a speech in front of the SPD's national congress.
""He [President Zeman] is deep in the worst moral dirt,"" Jiri Dienstbier, a former human rights minister, said on Twitter at the time.
For 31-year-old activist Jan Cemper, one of the organisers of Saturday's demonstrations, it is more important than ever that Czechs resist the growing influence of the SPD party, while also showing the world that not all Europeans agree with the increasingly present far-right values.
""We want to alert people that in the Czech Republic there is an increasing number of attacks against minorities due to policies executed by the SPD party,"" Cemper told Al Jazeera.
""At the same time, we want to show, that such congresses of xenophobes and populists are not welcome here. We have to try to refute various manipulative claims of populists and show that the EU has not only negatives but many positives.""

Donald Trump made the announcement on December 6 and said the US would begin the process of moving its embassy to the city from Tel Aviv.
The decision broke with decades of US policy on Jerusalem.
The international community has never recognised Israel's claim to the entire city.
Under the 1947 UN Partition Plan to divide historical Palestine between Jewish and Arab states, Jerusalem was granted special status and was meant to be placed under international sovereignty and control.
This status was based on the city's religious importance to the three Abrahamic religions; Christianity, Islam and Judaism.
Palestinians see East Jerusalem, which has been occupied by Israel since 1967, as the capital of their future state. Israel meanwhile insists that the city is its indivisible capital.
Here are five key developments since Trump's announcement:
A wave of anger spread from the Middle East to the rest of the world in the days following President Trump's announcement. More than a week on, tens of thousands continue to demonstrate. Four Palestinian protesters were killed during protests on Friday.
Solidarity rallies have spread as far as Istanbul, Jakarta, Karachi, Rabat, Chicago and Tokyo.
In the Middle East, protesters took to the streets of Amman, Beirut, the occupied West Bank, Jerusalem and Gaza.
While Friday is a key day for rallies in the Muslim world, protesters have taken to the streets daily in the occupied Palestinian territories, prompting the excessive use of force by Israeli security.
On December 14, they closed Gaza's border crossings for goods and pedestrians.
Israel launched a series of air raids, some of which turned deadly, against Palestinian targets in the days following Trump's announcement.
Israeli officials claim these raids were in response to rockets from inside the Gaza Strip.
On December 14, Israel struck a number of Hamas sites, including a naval facility and a military base near the al-Shati refugee camp in northern Gaza.
More than 10 attacks were carried out in total, leading to at least two deaths (see below) and damage to sites and nearby houses, according to a Palestinian security source.
At least eight Palestinians have been killed by Israel since Trump's announcement, according to the Palestinian health ministry.
Four demonstrators, including a disabled man in Gaza who lost both his legs in previous Israeli wars on the besieged strip, were fatally shot by Israeli forces on December 15.
On December 8, two Hamas fighters were killed in an Israeli air raid on the besieged Gaza Strip.
The individuals killed were identified as Mahmoud al-Atal, 28 and Mohammed Safadi, 30.
Israeli troops shot and killed two other Palestinians on the same day amid protests on the Israel-Palestine border.
The Palestinian Red Crescent has provided medical assistance to more than 1,933 people across the West Bank and Gaza Strip since Washington's policy change, according to the group.
Israeli security forces have arrested more than 260 Palestinians from the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem since Trump's declaration, according to a statement made by the Palestinian Prisoners Society on December 13.
Several of those arrested are children, including 16-year-old Fawzi al-Junaidi. An image of the teenager, blindfolded and surrounded by more than 20 Israeli occupation forces, was widely denounced as it was shared on social media earlier this week. He has denied charges of throwing stones.

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan called an extraordinary summit of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) for December 13 following Trump's decision on Jerusalem.
During the meeting in Istanbul, the 57-member group denounced Trump's move as ""null and void"" and called on the United Nations to ""end the Israeli occupation"" of Palestine.
Muslim leaders warned that Trump's administration will be liable for ""all the consequences of not retracting from this illegal decision"", saying they remain committed to a ""just and comprehensive peace based on the two-state solution"".
Founded in 1969, the OIC bills itself as ""the collective voice of the Muslim world"".
Turkey's Hurriyet newspaper reported on Friday that Erdogan will launch initiatives at the United Nations to have Washington's ""disgraceful"" decision annulled.
""As a country, we are determined to do our bit on this issue. We will wash the dirty laundry of those who breach international law,"" Erdogan said in a speech on Friday.
""We will work to annul this unlawful decision, first in the Security Council and then in the UN General Assembly if it is vetoed there.""
He added that Ankara will encourage other countries to recognise the Palestinian state.
""Right now, 137 countries in the world recognise the Palestinian state. God willing, this number will further increase with our efforts,"" he said.

The figure, published on Thursday in an MSF report, is significantly higher than the numbers reported by Myanmar military officials relating to the same period.
Sidney Wong, MSF's medical director, said the organisation gathered the data in six surveys of survivors of the violence in Myanmar's northwestern Rakhine state, based on research and interviews from a sample population of more than 600,000 people.
Many of these refugees are now sheltering in overcrowded and unsanitary camps in the Myanmar-Bangladesh border area.
""What we uncovered was staggering, both in terms of the numbers of people who reported a family member died as a result of violence, and the horrific ways in which they said they were killed or severely injured,"" she said.
""The numbers of deaths are likely to be an underestimation as we have not surveyed all refugee settlements in Bangladesh and because the surveys don't account for the families who never made it out of Myanmar.""
The report states that at least 9,000 Rohingya died in Rakhine state between August 25 and September 24, with 71.7 percent of those deaths caused by violence.
More than 620,000 Rohingya refugees have fled what the UN has labelled ""ethnic cleansing"" in Rakhine State since clashes broke out between government security forces and Rohingya fighters on August 25.
The military claims it acted legally in responding to coordinated attacks on border posts by a rebel armed group. Those who fled the violence did so voluntarily, some officials have said.
Myanmar's government has denied allegations of ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity, but it has refused UN investigators' and journalists' access to areas of the country affected by the violence.
MSF's research, based on the ""most conservative estimations"", revealed that at least 730 Rohingya children below the age of five-years-old were violently killed between in the month following August 25.
More than 59 percent of those under the age of five killed during that period were shot, 15 percent were burned to death, 7 percent were beaten to death and 2 percent killed in landmine blasts, according to MSF.
Those still entering Bangladesh from neighbouring Myanmar continue to ""report being subject to violence in recent weeks"", Wong said.
""With very few independent aid groups able to access Maungdaw district in Rakhine, we fear for the fate of Rohingya people who are still there,"" she added.
Bangladesh and Myanmar signed a deal last month for the return of hundreds of thousands of Rohingya refugees, but little is known of its provisions.
State Chancellor Aung San Suu Kyi, who is the de facto leader of Myanmar, has refused to really discuss the plight of the Rohingya.
Aung San Suu Kyi and her government do not recognise the Rohingya as an ethnic group and have blamed violence in Rakhine, and subsequent military crackdowns, on those they call ""terrorists"".

Living in a squatted office belonging to Syriza, Greece's ruling left-wing party, in Mytilene, the 30-year-old Iranian Kurd explained that he spent more than a year in the decrepit and overcrowded Moria camp, a closed facility on Lesbos Island.
Nenareh is one of the dozens of refugees who currently, with the support and assistance of local anti-fascist activists, have occupied Syriza's office for more than two weeks.
They want to be moved to Athens and put in proper accommodation rather than refugee camps.
""It was like hell there, and everyone knows it,"" he told Al Jazeera, recalling living in a small tent with eight others in the camp, which is currently home to more than 6,000 refugees and migrants.
""I can't explain how bad it was.""
After making the dangerous journey across the mountainous border region between Iran and Turkey and taking a dinghy across the Mediterranean Sea to Greece, he found himself waiting in seemingly endless queues to see a doctor or get a bottle of water in Moria.
""We would wake up at six in the morning and wait for a long time, sometimes two hours, for a small bottle of water and a little piece of bread,"" he remembered.
""There's a lot of pressure and tension [in the camp], and fights broke out in the queues often.""
Although the Greek government has barred asylum seekers from travelling to the country's mainland, authorities recently announced a decision to move 5,000 refugees and migrants to Athens to ease the mounting pressure on the islands due to overcrowding.
Yet, life took a turn for the worse after Nenareh received news his asylum application was rejected, prompting him to leave Moria out of fear of being apprehended by police.
""After the refusal came, I knew that [authorities] could arrest me at any moment,"" he said, adding that he faced ""problems"" in Iran due to Kurdish political activism.
Although Nenareh declined to provide details about his situation in Iran owing to concern for the safety of his family, watchdogs have decried the Iranian government's treatment of the Kurdish minority, which comprises around 8 percent of the population.
Because of the March 2016 deal between the European Union and Turkey, which aims to stem the flow of refugees from to Europe, asylum seekers can apply in Greece or be deported to Turkey to apply for relocation from there.
More than 60,000 refugees and migrants are stranded in Greece due to that deal and a series of closed borders across the Balkan region.
In September, Greece's highest administrative court ruled that two rejected Syrian asylum seekers could be returned to Turkey after rejecting appeals against their deportation orders.
That decision drew the condemnation of rights groups, including Amnesty International.
John Dalhuisen, Amnesty International's Europe director, described the decision ""as an ominous precedent for many other asylum-seekers who have fled conflict and persecution and are currently stranded on the Greek islands"".
Explaining in a statement at the time that conditions for refugees in Turkey are unsafe, Dalhuisen continued: ""Until such time as asylum-seekers and refugees can be guaranteed effective protection in Turkey, EU countries must stop sending them there.""
For Nenareh, life has become doubly difficult while stuck in limbo, dodging authorities and feeling hopeless and out of options.
""We no longer feel safe going out,"" he said, alluding to the chance of being arrested and an apparent upsurge in anti-refugee xenophobia on Lesbos.
While Nenareh and dozens of others recently occupied Sappho Square, a central area in Mytilene, for more than a month to protest living conditions in Moria, local far-rightists hurled racist insults at them and photographed their faces.
""We go and get food, but then we hurry back. We get a pack of cigarettes, but we don't wait around. It's not safe.""
At the time of publication, Greece's migration ministry had not replied to Al Jazeera's request for a comment.
Greek Migration Minister Yiannis Mouzalas recently defended the EU-Turkey deal against widespread criticism.
""Despite the difficulties of [the deal], which has gray areas Europe must clarify, it is a useful agreement for Greece,"" he told the local Ekathimerini daily last month.
Nasim Lomani, a member of the Solidarity Initiative for Political and Economic Refugees activist group, said that Greek authorities often provide asylum to members of a family and reject their relatives.
""Practically speaking, they divide families so that half of the families can move from the island and other cannot,"" he told Al Jazeera.
""Meanwhile, the plan seems to be to keep the conditions [on the islands] so bad that others don't come [from Turkey].”
Raza, a 31-year-old ethnic Arab who fled Iran's Ahvaz and arrived in Greece six months ago, also had his first asylum request rejected.
Ahvaz is the capital of Iran's Khuzestan region, which is home to more than three million Arabs who endure systematic discrimination related to politics, employment and cultural rights, according to rights groups.
Ahvaz's Arabs have also been targeted by mass arrests and executions for their political activism, Amnesty International has observed in the past.
Armine Nenareh, Iranian Kurdish refugee in Greece
Declining to provide his surname for fear of his relatives' safety in Iran, he explained that he spent three months in Moria before leaving the camp after his asylum request was rejected.
""The police [in Moria] made us feel like we were prisoners,"" he told Al Jazeera. ""In every way, they didn't treat us well.""
Although Raza and Nenareh have filed appeals, they are not hopeful that Greek authorities will reverse their decisions.
Raza's lawyer recently told him there is 90-percent chance his appeal will be rejected, he said.
Raza worries about eventually being returned to Iran, where he says his brother died in prison after being jailed for political activities.
""I have an Iranian passport, I don't want it,"" he said, adding that he hopes to reach the United Kingdom and obtain asylum there. ""I want to study, to get married, and I've never started my life because of our situation in Iran.""
Unsure of his fate, Raza said he is exhausted from stress. Authorities have informed him that he has until January 31 to successfully appeal his asylum rejection or leave the country, he said.
""Waiting is hard, it's like a mental prison,"" Raza added. ""I had no idea Europe was going to be like this … I am scared to return to either Turkey or Iran.""
For his part, Nenareh no longer wants to stay in Greece.
""At this point, I would go anywhere where people treat me like a human being,"" he concluded. ""We're all [rejected asylum seekers] in the same situation.""

Recent months have seen Prime Minister Viktor Orban's ruling conservative party, Fidesz, move further right, while Jobbik, a party with neo-Nazi roots, attempts to rebrand itself as a traditional European conservative party.
Fidesz' left-wing rival, the Hungarian Socialist Party, is fractured. Meanwhile, there has been a flurry of far-right activity.
Fidesz has focused the bulk of its ire on human rights groups and aid organisations that have criticised its crackdown on asylum seekers entering or passing through the country.
Under the party, the government has been a leading voice against the influx of refugees.
In recent months, Hungary was again flung into the spotlight over an ongoing campaign against billionaire investor and philanthropist George Soros, whose Open Society Foundations (OSF) charity advocates for greater acceptance of refugees and migrants.
Headed by Prime Minister Orban, Fidesz is Hungary's ruling party and controls the government.
Founded in 1988 under the former communist government (1949-1989), Fidesz was initially a libertarian youth party. The party eventually evolved into an establishment conservative party that resembled many of its European counterparts.
However, Fidesz's rightward shift continued, and the party has since incorporated policies that have raised red flags among experts.
Peter Kreko, political scientist
Orban, Hungary's third longest-serving prime minister, has been accused by critics of authoritarian and illiberal tendencies. He was first elected to office for a four-year term in 1998. He came back to power 2010 and was re-elected in 2014.
There are no limits on how many terms a Hungarian prime minister can serve.
The arrival of around one million refugees to Europe in 2015 saw the ruling party swiftly position itself as a supposed defender of ""Christian Europe"".
""Since the refugee crisis, [Fidesz] has become much more radical and even more prejudiced than it was before,"" Peter Kreko, a political scientist at Political Capital Policy Research and Consulting Institute, told Al Jazeera.
That shift has been ""amplified"" by the government's recent campaign against Soros, he said.
Earlier this year, Orban and his allies launched an effort to shutdown the Central European University, a Budapest-based university founded by Soros.
At the time, Orban lambasted Soros as ""big and powerful"" and accused him of ""destroy[ing] the lives of millions of Europeans with his financial speculations"".
Hungary's ruling Fidesz party has made philanthropist George Soros a primary target of its criticism [File: Bernadett Szabo/Reuters]
Critics have alleged that the anti-Soros campaign has anti-Semitic undertones that play on racist stereotypes which maintain that Jews control the global financial system.
In November, Gergely Gulyas, leader of the Fidesz parliamentary group, claimed that Soros has launched a ""full frontal attack"" on the country ""because in its immigration policy Hungary continues to stand its ground against the forces supporting immigration"".
An opinion poll published in early November concluded that Fidesz maintains a support rating of 61 percent, as reported by Hungarian Free Press.
Jobbik made waves when it was founded in 2003, launching on Eurosceptic, anti-Semitic and anti-migrant positions.
In 2013, the party drew sharp criticism for protesting the World Jewish Congress in Budapest, which it claimed was a demonstration against ""a Jewish attempt to buy up Hungary"".
Recent years have seen the party shift from open anti-Semitism to a more brazen form of pro-Russian, anti-Muslim and anti-refugee politics that lines up with other European far-right parties.
Last year, the party submitted a bill designed to ban the resettlement of refugees in the country as part of the EU's refugee distribution quota.
Cas Mudde, an expert on far-right politics and associate professor in the School of Public and International Affairs at the University of Georgia, said Jobbik ""has partly been forced to remake itself into a mainstream right-wing party"" because Fidesz has been ""effectively dominating 'their' themes of authoritarianism, nativism and populism"".
""[Jobbik is] now mainly a radical right anti-Fidesz party though, whose electorate is their core base and radical right people who are upset about the corruption of the governing party,"" he told Al Jazeera.
Last week, Jobbik chairman Gabor Vona said massive fines from state auditors may prevent it from participating in April's elections.
The party has been ordered to reply by December 21 to auditors' claim that it spent an illegal, under-market prices for anti-government billboard advertisements, the Associated Press news agency reported.
Speaking to media, Vona accused the government of executing a ""brutal attack"" against Jobbik by ""using"" the state auditors office.
""It is unprecedented and unimaginable in European democracies for a government to try to use such means to ruin its biggest challenger four months before the elections.""
In July, a cohort of far-rightists assembled in Budapest to announce the establishment of Force and Determination, an openly-racist group seeking to run in next year's parliamentary elections.
While the number of members is not public, the inaugural rally attracted around 300 supporters.
Although small, experts say the group represents the splintering of Jobbik's support base and draws from former Jobbik members disillusioned with the party's redressing as a centre-right outfit.
Others on the hardcore fringe of Hungary's far right have also joined Force and Determination.
""While some hardliners have left Jobbik in protest, these groups seem to have only local or regional support, and leave Jobbik unchallenged at the national level,"" said Mudde.
According to a Reuters report in July, Force and Determination promotes open racism against refugees and Roma, the ethnic minority that makes up an estimated 315,000 people in Hungary.
Addressing the influx of refugees to Europe, Balazs Laszlo, one of the movement's leaders, told followers at the time: ""Tens of millions are added to the ranks of the Arabs, Africans and gypsies who will show no tolerance once they realise the power that their demographic significance lends them.
""Our ethnic community must come first ... there is no equality.""
In September, a leader of the movement declared that refugee camps would ""burn"" if the EU continued to force ""their multicultural ideology on us"".
""The question is, if we let in a single one [asylum-seeker], then the others will come too,"" Janos Lantos said during a demonstration, the local Budapest Beacon reported at the time.
""We're proud we are Hungarian, we're proud to be members of the European white race.""

However, this is the ticket which attracted the highest number of votes in October's first round.
Weah, of the Coalition for Democratic Change (CDC), and Vice President Joseph Boakai of the ruling Unity Party, ranked first and second respectively in the October polls.
But claims of fraud have stalled the outcome, with a second round postponed.
The CDC formed out of an alliance between Weah's Congress for Democratic Change, Howard-Taylor's National Patriotic Party (NPP) and the Liberia People Democratic Party - which is headed by former House of Representatives Speaker Alex Tyler. Weah and Howard-Taylor are the presidential and vice-presidential candidates respectively for this coalition.
Al Jazeera spoke to Howard-Taylor about Liberia's past and future.
Al Jazeera: Why are you running for vice president?
Howard-Taylor: It began many years ago, looking at the destruction of our country and the need for patriotic Liberians in rebuilding it. I served as first lady in a critical period where we had war on our hands and the whole system disintegrated to the point where the regime was asked to resign and leave the country.
I came home in 2004 and in 2005 was given an opportunity by the people of Bong County to serve as senator. I thought that as a patriotic citizen and a woman leader it would be a good place to build my own career and impact positively on our country.
Al Jazeera: Why should people believe that you are not pursuing the agenda of your ex-husband, former President Charles Taylor?
Howard-Taylor: You have to see where I've sat for the past 12 years and the agenda that I've carried.
I'm the standard-bearer of the NPP and our motto is: ""Above all else the people."" That is the NPP agenda.
If someone says that Senator Taylor wants to bring back the Taylor agenda, I ask: ""What is the Taylor agenda?"" During the crisis I was not in the country; I was away at school. If I wasn't here, there's no way you can say I was involved.
Jewel Howard-Taylor, vice standard bearer of CDC
All I know is that my country ended up in flames and I think it's unfair when people try to blame me for things about which I had no idea.
I go out every day and try to do my best. But others continue to say, ""there's a problem with this woman"".
If there was a problem with me, I never would have been elected as senator in 2005.
Even as first lady, I created a humanitarian task force for people in the displaced camps. Did I have on military gear fighting and killing? No. I decided that I would spend my time providing whatever support I could to help alleviate the suffering of people.
It was basically through this that I was elected and I could not have been elected twice if I were the Jewel Taylor that the world wants to see.
Al Jazeera: Do you have any concerns about George Weah's lack of political experience?
Howard-Taylor: What does it require? I had no political experience when I ran for senator in 2005. There are people who say George Weah is just a footballer but he's not; he's the best in his field and set a standard that no one has surpassed.
Let's look at what it takes. Football, first of all, is a team sport. If George Weah was an individualistic person, the team would never have had a chance of winning. His second attribute is his vision. Coming from a ghetto to reach where he did, he must have been committed and hardworking to become the best.
[Being president] requires commitment, it requires love for country. No one has shown more love for Liberia than George Weah. In the middle of the crisis when people were fighting and buying arms, he was in the refugee camps providing leadership and solace.
People don't think about the possibilities of what others could bring to the table. Look at where we are after 12 years. This government has had a lot of support yet we still have a broken system.
It takes someone who loves their country enough to make a difference, and I think that is the only criteria when you're looking for a president.
Al Jazeera: How do you view President Sirleaf's legacy?
Howard-Taylor: It hasn't been an easy road. She inherited a completely broken system and she's done the best that she could. You cannot overlook the challenges she has faced ... she managed to come from the back of the room and stand on the front stage.
As she is now prepared to turn the baton over to a new generation, I think we will all continue to say thank you to her for maintaining peace and stability and taking us to where we are.
Al Jazeera: How would you compare yourself to her?
Howard-Taylor: I can't. But, I believe the fire she had when she began the process to ensure that one day a woman would become president is the same fire that I have in my soul to continue to work for my country so that we don't remain the byword.
I grew up here when Liberia was the New York of West Africa and our generation has a responsibility to fix it.

The sexual assault survivors from several refugee camps were interviewed separately and extensively.
The women gave AP their names, but agreed to be publicly identified only by their first initial, citing fears they or their families would be killed by Myanmar's military.
They ranged in age from 13 years old to 35, came from a wide swath of villages in Myanmar's Rakhine state and described assaults between October 2016 and mid-September.
Yet there was a sickening sameness to their stories, with distinct patterns in their accounts, their assailants' uniforms and the details of the rapes themselves.
The testimonies bolster the UN's contention that Myanmar's armed forces are systematically employing rape as a ""calculated tool of terror"" aimed at exterminating the Rohingya people.
The Myanmar armed forces did not respond to multiple requests from the AP for comment, but an internal military investigation last month concluded that none of the assaults ever took place.
When journalists asked about rape allegations during a government-organised trip to Rakhine in September, Rakhine's minister for border affairs, Phone Tint, replied: ""These women were claiming they were raped, but look at their appearances - do you think they are that attractive to be raped?""
Doctors and aid workers, however, say they are stunned at the sheer volume of rapes, and suspect only a fraction of women have come forward.
Doctors Without Borders (MSF) volunteers have treated 113 sexual violence survivors since August, a third of them under 18. The youngest was nine.
Each woman interviewed by the AP described attacks that involved groups of men, often coupled with other forms of extreme violence.
Every woman except one said the assailants wore military-style uniforms, generally dark green or camouflage.
The lone woman who described her attackers as wearing plain clothes said her neighbours recognised them from the local military outpost.
Many women said the uniforms bore various patches featuring stars or, in a couple cases, arrows. Such patches represent the different units of Myanmar's army.
Though the scale of these attacks is new, the use of sexual violence by Myanmar's security forces is not.
Before she became Myanmar's civilian leader, Aung San Suu Kyi herself said Myanmar's armed forces used rape as a weapon to intimidate ethnic nationalities.
Yet Suu Kyi's government has not only failed to condemn the recent accounts of rape, it has dismissed the accounts as lies.
In December 2016, the government issued a press release disputing Rohingya women's reports of sexual assaults, accompanied by an image that said ""Fake Rape"".
The newlyweds were asleep in their home in western Myanmar in June when seven soldiers charged in.
The woman, a Rohingya Muslim who agreed to be identified by her first initial, F, knew enough to be terrified.
She knew the military had been attacking Rohingya villages, as part of what the United Nations has called ethnic cleansing in the mostly Buddhist nation.
She heard just days before that soldiers had killed her parents and that her brother was missing.
Now they had come for her. The men bound her husband with rope, and tied her scarf around his mouth. They yanked off her jewelry and tore off her clothes. They threw her to the floor.
And then, she says, the first soldier began to rape her.
She struggled against him, but four men held her down and beat her with sticks. Her husband finally wriggled the gag out of his mouth and screamed.
And then she watched as a soldier fired a bullet into the chest of the man she had married only one month before. Another soldier slit his throat.
Her mind grew fuzzy. When the soldiers were finished, they dragged her outside and set her bamboo house ablaze.
It would be two months before she realised her misery was far from over: She was pregnant.
More than three months after the men burst into F's home, she was living with her neighbours - a couple and their five-year-old son. The timing of her rape left little doubt that the baby growing inside her belonged to one of the men who had caused all her grief.
She could only pray that things would not get worse. And then, one night in mid-September, they did.
The men broke down the door. There were five of them this time, F remembers. They slashed the boy's throat, and killed the man.
Then they turned to the man's wife, and to F. And her nightmare began again.
They stripped off the women's clothes and threw them to the floor. F's friend fought back, and the men beat her so viciously the skin on her thighs began to peel away.
But the fight had gone out of F. She felt her body go soft, felt the blood run between her legs as the first man forced himself on her, and then the second. Three men savaged her friend.
When it was over, the women lay on the floor for days.
Finally, F hauled herself to her feet, pulling her friend up with her. Hand in hand, the women stumbled to the next village, and then began the 10-day journey to Bangladesh.
Which is where F lives now, in a tiny bamboo shelter between two filthy latrines. And it is here that F prays her baby will be a boy - because this world is no place for a girl.
The child will be the only family F has left. For her, the most haunting reminder of the agony she endured also, somehow, represents her last chance at happiness.
""Everybody has died,"" she says. ""I don't have anyone to care for me. If I give this baby away, what will I have left? There will be nothing to live for.""

The findings by German monitor, Rigardu, paint a grim picture of systematic abuse on the borders of Serbia - which is not an EU country - and Hungary and Croatia, which are both members of the bloc.
The group said on Sunday it had documented at least 857 instances of people being subjected to violence, including kicking and dog bites, so far this year.
Of that total, 52 incidents involved minors.
Rigardu also recorded at least 110 cases of Hungarian and Croatian authorities carrying out illegal deportations to Serbia. There were also allegations of push-backs by Slovenian officers on the country’s border with Croatia.
Using photographic evidence and first-person testimonies, Rigardu has now launched an online database to document individual cases of violence and push-backs by EU countries' forces along the so-called Balkan route.
The group said the actual number of such incidents is likely to be far higher since many cases of push-backs and police violence often go unreported.
Lazara Marinkovic, a Serbian journalist who has covered the refugee crisis for several years, said reports such as the one published by Rigardu ""are very common and the testimonies are consistent with the injuries"" she had observed on several occasions.
""Most of the violent push-backs come from Croatian and Hungarian border police,"" she told Al Jazeera from Serbia’s capital, Belgrade.
""I've met a lot of people who showed me their phones had been broken and their injuries.""
In one incident recorded by Rigardu, on November 4, six Afghan men were allegedly attacked and beaten by Croatian border guards.
When one of the men, whose name has been withheld, requested to apply for asylum, he was told by an officer, ""We don't need you people to come here”, according to the testimony provided to the group.
On October 19, Croatian police officers apprehended four Afghan men crossing from Serbia's Sid. After beating them and stealing their money, according to the account given to Rigardu, one of the officers allegedly shoved a tree branch into one of the men's mouth.
""They shouted, 'Don't speak, go back to Serbia',"" the group’s report said.
In another incident, on October 7, four Tunisians and a Moroccan were allegedly beaten and subjected to death threats by Croatian border police, said Rigardu.
The officers hit them with the handle of a baton and then beat them again after they had already crossed the border back into Serbia, the men said in their testimony.
""F*ck you, go to Serbia, next time we [will] kill you,"" they claimed the officers told them while beating them.
Contacted by Al Jazeera, a Croatian police spokesperson said in an email that in the cases they have investigated, authorities have ""not found unprofessional or unlawful conduct of police officers toward migrants"".
The police spokesperson added: ""The use of ... force or bodily force is being analysed for each particular case, and the ministry [of interior] takes care that the police officers act in compliance with the legal use of police powers.""
Speaking to Al Jazeera by email, the Hungarian government's international communications office said it ""utterly rejects"" the allegations, claiming they are ""once more seeking to discredit personnel on duty at the border"".
""The police are performing their duties lawfully, professionally and proportionately, and they place special emphasis on treating migrants humanely and with respect for their human dignity,"" the office said.
""Migrants on Hungary’s borders are not being harassed, and the significant numbers of unaccompanied minors who have been arriving are being provided with protection, health care and education,"" it added.
""Hungary treats those in genuine need humanely, and those waiting on its borders or on its territory receive fair treatment. Migrants are also expected to abide by EU and Hungarian laws, however.""
Speaking to Al Jazeera by email, a Slovenian police spokesperson said the claims come ""as a major surprise"", adding that they ""are committed to maintaining high standards of professionalism"" and upholding human rights.
""We are not aware of any such cases of push-backs and violence [by] the Slovenian police.""
Lydia Gall, a Balkan region researcher for Human Rights Watch (HRW), explained that push-backs across the borders into Serbia are ""unlawful"" and are often ""accompanied by various levels of abuse and violence"".
The practices have been going on for years, she told Al Jazeera. ""This has been flagged time and again to the European Union for several years now … and yet the European Commission has chosen not to act on this issue specifically,"" said Gall.
Last month, a six-year-old Afghan girl was fatally struck by a train after Croatian police officers allegedly forced her family to walk down the train tracks in the direction of Serbia.
In a statement later published online, the Croatian Ministry of Interior dismissed claims of responsibility. ""We emphasise that the conduct of the Croatian border police did not in any way cause the accident and death of the girl,"" it said.
HRW's Gall described the incident as a ""sad consequence of the unlawful and often inhumane practices"" carried out on EU borders with Serbia.
""This poor girl and her poor family were victims of these horrifying practices as they pan out,"" she said.

The prevailing images of unarmed Palestinians throwing rocks at fully armed Israeli troops and military vehicles, which clearly showed the occupied and the occupier, were covered with unprecedented interest by international media.
These images and the uprising became symbolic of protest movements around the world.
On December 8, 1987, an Israeli vehicle ran over a car carrying four Palestinian workers in Jabalya refugee camp, in the northern Gaza Strip. The four Palestinians were killed, and the camp broke out in spontaneous protests, which rapidly spread across the remainder of the strip and into the West Bank.
Tensions had already been running high prior to the outbreak of protests, cultivated by a worsening political climate for Palestinians, in the form of a 1984 Israeli unity government between the right-wing and leftist camps. In addition to continuous land expropriation, Israel had total control of Palestinian social, economic and political development.
The six-year Intifada was characterised by popular mobilisation and mass protests. It was also saturated by civil disobedience, well-organised strikes, and communal cooperatives.
When Israeli occupation forces imposed long-running curfews on towns and cities, Palestinians ran underground universities, schools and clinics. Boycotts of Israeli products and businesses led to the emergence of a national economy fueled by homegrown goods and increased agricultural productivity.
According to Israeli human rights organisation B'Tselem, 1,070 Palestinians were killed by Israeli forces during the Intifada years, including 237 children. Jewish settlers also killed 54 Palestinians.
More than 175,000 Palestinians were also arrested in the same period, and 2,000 homes were demolished in Israel's systematic method of collective punishment.
Under Israel's then-defence minister Yitzhak Rabin's orders, Israeli army commanders were instructed to break the bones of Palestinian protesters. Today, this policy has evolved to specifically target the knees and legs of Palestinian youth to disable them.
Below, three Palestinians who lived through the Intifada share their experiences.
On February 26, 1988, 17-year-old Wael Joudeh and his cousin Osamah were returning home from grazing their sheep when they noticed a group of Israeli soldiers following them back to their village, east of Nablus.
As the soldiers caught up with them, they began beating them and for a period of 30 minutes, Israeli forces used stones to break their bones.
The incident was caught on video, and was the first documented incident that brought to light Israel's ""breaking the bones"" policy.
Today, Wael sits on the same rock he was pushed down on before he was beaten. As he sits there silently, he recalls the painful moments he thought were his last.
""At first, one of the soldiers took off his military hard-hat and started pounding it on my head until I fell to the ground. He then proceeded to beat me uncontrollably,"" Wael told Al Jazeera.
""Then he lifted me up, and shoved his helmet towards my face and shouted out what was written on it,"" he recalled.
""I was born to kill Palestinians,"" the soldier screamed at Wael.
""One of them twisted my arm against my back, while another started pounding my wrist with a stone, attempting to break my hand completely,"" he said.
Meanwhile, Osamah was attempting to escape, but was immediately dragged down by three Israeli soldiers and beaten on the ground.
""They were beating us with every ounce of their energy. They not only wanted to break our bones and to inflict physical pain on us, they also wanted to humiliate us and shatter our spirit,"" said Wael.
""The stones of Palestine were merciful,"" he recalled. ""That's why we survived.""
The pair were unaware, at the time, that a man in a building 200 metres away was documenting every moment of their painful ordeal.
Though women from the nearby village attempted to stop the attack, Israeli soldiers dragged Wael and Osamah to the vehicle that eventually transported them to Tubas' al-Faraa detention centre, in the occupied West Bank.
That night, an Israeli officer stormed into Wael's cell and asked, ""Are you the one whose bones were smashed by the soldier?""
""Now the whole world thinks you're dead,"" he told Wael.
The pair were then taken to a room in the detention centre, where they were surprised to see a crowd of journalists rushing towards them. Cameras were pointed at their faces while questions were being yelled out about the incident that had been caught on tape.
""We didn't know it was documented, we were in shock,"" said Wael, who spoke up about what happened to him.
Shortly after, the two were released because of the media pressure.
""We expected them to detain us again after the journalists left, but they didn't.""
This was not the first time Wael survived an abduction. On December 31, 1985, a group of Israeli settlers kidnapped him while he was on his way to school.
When Israeli forces intervened, they were quick to detain and interrogate him. At just 17, Wael was sentenced to seven months imprisonment.
Over a span of six years during the Intifada, Wael was arrested five times and spent varying periods in Israeli prisons and detention centres.
Now 46 years old, Wael works as an employee of the Palestinian Ministry of Finance. He got married in 1996 and has four children, two of whom are currently university students.
""I always tell my children what happened to me. I do not ever try to hide it,"" he said. ""They always tell my story to their colleagues and friends.""
Wael and Osamah are considered prominent icons of the first Intifada. What they went through sparked demonstrations and a grassroots uprising, that forced the Arab League into holding an emergency meeting regarding the fate of the people in the occupied Palestinian territories.
But Wael believes he and Osamah never got the respect they deserve.
""The people's respect is the most important thing, but unfortunately, the Palestinian Authority has not shown us any respect or appreciation,"" he said.
Khadija walks slowly, dragging her foot that had been injured when she was shot by Israeli soldiers.
Her children and grandchildren gather around her in her house in Jalazone camp, north of Ramallah, and she tells them the story of her struggle during the first Intifada.
She was a survivor of a time of terrible repression, a time when soldiers of the occupation did their utmost to suppress the Intifada. At their worst, they stopped differentiating between men and women, children and the elderly. Everyone was targeted similarly.
Khadija Abu Shreifa is a Palestinian refugee. Her family was forced out of their home in the village of Safriyya in 1948. They moved to the Aqabat Jabr camp in Jericho, then to the Wahdat camp in Jordan, and finally to the Jalazone camp after the war in September 1970.
Khadija, 65, does not remember the exact date, but she remembers every detail of the day. She remembers the men and women of Jalazone camp heading out in a large demonstration, that ended in violent suppression at the hands of Israeli forces who then spread throughout the camp.
""I heard one of the soldiers of the occupation verbally harassing a group of young girls, saying sexual things to them. That made me angry so I tried to confront him but he started cursing me and moved towards me to hit me, so I attacked him and started hitting him.""
Khadija told Al Jazeera an entire Israeli military squad attacked her, the soldiers beating her and pulling her hair. One of the soldiers shot her at close range, intending to kill her, but striking her with two bullets, one in the shoulder and the other in the foot. This made her the first person to be wounded in Jalazone camp during the first Intifada.
The women of the camp hurried to rescue Khadija from the Israeli soldiers. ""One of the women tore parts of her hijab off to bind my wounds. Then the people of the camp took me to the hospital in Ramallah, where an Israeli officer came to try to arrest me.
""But I was smuggled out of the hospital,"" she said.
Khadija added that the women of the camp went out to demonstrate and express their anger at the attack. Israeli forces suppressed the march violently, and 40 women were injured by rubber bullets.
As soon as Khadija returned to Jalazone, she was welcomed by residents with a big parade that marched her around the whole camp.
She was carried on their shoulders as she chanted ""No fear! No fear!"" - and the residents chanted with her.
This was not the end of Khadija's involvement; she continued her struggle along with the other women of the camp.
""The Israeli soldiers were always after the children; they would arrest them and beat them. Whenever I saw them arresting a child, I would pull him away from them, claiming that he was my son.""
During the first Intifada, Israeli forces often imposed a curfew, sometimes for as long as 40 consecutive days. When the curfew was that long, residents would run out of food in their homes, and that was when Khadija would venture out of the camp to fetch food and distribute it.
""I told the Israeli soldiers that my daughter was ill and needed medicine, and I got a permit to go out in our family's car. On my way back I filled the car with food and vegetables and distributed them to residents in the camp.""
The President of the Union of Palestinian Women's Committees, Khitam Saafin, told Al Jazeera that Palestinian women played important roles during the first Intifada.
Most important among these roles was the formation of committees, in various neighbourhoods, that would teach children during the general strikes that were in place during the first year of the Intifada.
Women played a central role in the demonstrations and confrontations with Israeli occupation forces. Saafin recalls women transporting stones to demonstrators on the front lines, and joining in to throw them at Israeli soldiers.
""Women also succeeded in preventing Israeli forces from arresting youth and children; they would fearlessly attack the soldiers and pull the child or young man away by force, so they were able to escape their clutches.""
She added the women's efforts were also successful in imposing a boycott on Israeli products and in producing a Palestinian alternative.
""Israeli products were stagnant in the shops, nobody was buying them … while Palestinian products were starting to replace them.""
Saafin also talked of a group of female neighbours who would meet regularly to produce local handmade products, as replacements for Israeli ones.
This was especially vital during the long curfew days, when getting to the markets was extremely difficult and dangerous.
""If someone had a small plot of land, they would volunteer it to the women who would plant it and make use of it. The women would do the planting and harvesting and distribute their crops to the people in their neighbourhood,"" she explained.
Graffiti was a resistance tool used during the first Intifada, where Palestinians - separated by the imposition of a curfew - would leave each other messages, said Abdullah Abu Shalbak from al-Bireh on the outskirts of Ramallah.
These messages, written on the walls of refugee camps and neighbourhoods across the occupied West Bank, were the only means of communication available at a time when modern-day mobile phone technology and the internet were not available.
Abu Shalbak was among the youth tasked with writing slogans on al-Bireh's walls. But this job was a difficult one, since they were targeted by Israeli forces.
Abu Shalbak, who was 19 years old during the first Intifada, told Al Jazeera that writing on the wall would only happen at night.
""Israeli forces would roam the streets during the day,"" he told Al Jazeera. ""They would also plant agents in the neighbourhoods.""
He added his faction would send messages to its members, who were structured in two-person teams. These usually announced a general strike, or simply extended congratulatory messages on the occasion of Eid holidays.
Sometimes the messages would serve the purpose of threatening Israeli forces and their agents who were present in al-Bireh.
Dressed with a keffiyeh covering their faces, Abu Shalbak and his partner would sneak out in the middle of the night to write their party's slogans on the walls of the town.
The day before an Eid holiday, Abu Shalbak and his friend were writing well-wishes on the walls in al-Bireh, when occupation forces raided the town and began pursuing them. The two young men had previously made a pact that should this happen, they would each run in opposite directions and then later meet at a specific location.
""The chances of us getting arrested was very high,"" Abu Shalbak said. ""We managed to run away and then meet up later, before I noticed my friend was injured and losing a lot of blood, after his leg caught on a fence he jumped over.""
Abu Shalbak called a doctor he trusted to treat his friend, and then took him to his home. Since the next day was Eid, his friend was afraid that his absence from the crowds of well-wishers would raise suspicions, since he was confined to his house because of his wounded leg.
For three years of the Intifada, Abu Shalbak continued to write slogans and graffiti on the walls. The Israeli forces never suspected him of being behind this act, even when he was finally detained.
""I was arrested by the Israeli special forces and was accused of throwing stones and Molotov cocktails at them,"" he said. ""I was subjected to harsh interrogation but they had no idea what it was that I really did.""
Abu Shalbak spent a few months in prison before his release. The Israeli army's pursuit of those who wrote political messages of the Palestinian factions and popular committees was not the only thing that bothered him.
He faced other obstacles, such as the anger of some people who did not want graffiti on the walls of their homes and scrubbed them off, out of fear of punishment by the occupation forces.
Other problems played out in the rivalry between Palestinian factions who would write over each other's graffiti. Furthermore, collaborators were tasked by their Israeli masters to paint over fresh messages on the wall before they were seen by residents of the neighbourhood.
Walls were not just for Palestinian graffiti. Occupation forces also used them to leave coded symbols for their collaborators.
""The Israeli army would draw a circle with a triangle inside of it,"" Abu Shalbak said. ""Inside the triangle would be another sign. This drawing represented the location and timing of where the soldiers would meet the collaborator.
""One of our missions was to also watch out for what the occupation forces would write on the walls, and to remove their messages quickly before their agent could see it.""
During the first Intifada's latter stages, Abu Shalbak joined the military wing of Hamas, and established the movement's first military cell in the West Bank. He was arrested by Israel again, and this time sentenced to 21 years in prison.
Abu Shalbak obtained a degree in the Hebrew language during his years in prison. When he was released as part of the 2011 prisoners' swap, he enrolled in Hebron University and got his undergraduate degree in the same field.
Today, he is a recognised instructor and offers Hebrew courses, especially to employees in Palestinian government institutions.

Protesters threw stones at security forces who had barricaded the main road leading to the US embassy in the Awkar area, north of Beirut, on Sunday.
Al Jazeera's Zeina Khodr, reporting from Awkar, said several hundred Palestinians clashed with the security forces.
""There is a lot of anger here. What they're chanting is 'Palestine forgive us, they closed the door on us', clearly in reference to Arab leaders,"" Khodr said.
""The anger is not just directed at the United States for its decision to recognise Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. The protesters here feel Arab leaders have just been talking, but not taking any action. What people here are calling for is a new intifada and on the Palestinian Authority to end the peace process,"" she added.
Security forces cordoned off the area around the embassy and deployed water cannon, stopping people about 3km away from the embassy building.
Demonstrators were trying to remove the barbed wire and climb over the barricade.
Security forces responded by firing tear gas canisters to disperse the protesters. The Lebanese government has called on the protesters not to damage property in the area.
Since 1947, Palestinians fleeing Israel have settled across Lebanon in 12 refugee camps. Official figures show there are about 450,000 Palestinians in Lebanon, but over the years the number has decreased.
""Many of them have given up hope of returning to Palestine, and have moved to Europe, to Canada. They find any route out of Lebanon, because they are denied many right here,"" Khodr said, adding that this was not the first protest of its kind since Trump announced his decision on Jerusalem.
""Protests have been taking place across Lebanon since Wednesday. Tomorrow (Monday), we are expecting a mass rally in the southern suburbs of Beirut, called for by Hezbollah.""
Trump's embassy move has inflamed the Israel-Palestine conflict, in which the status of Jerusalem is a key issue. The Palestinians see occupied East Jerusalem as the capital of their future state.
On Sunday, violence erupted for a fourth day in the occupied Palestinian territories in response to Trump's announcement. Witnesses said Israeli forces fired tear gas canisters at groups of rallying youth in the Aida refugee camp in Bethlehem.
The protests came after Israeli air raids killed two Palestinians in Gaza on Saturday after fighters reportedly fired rockets from Gaza into Israel on Friday.
Other protests have taken place in the Indonesia capital, Jakarta, where about 10,000 people rallied on Sunday outside the US Embassy to denounce Trump's decision.
The head of the Arab League called the decision ""dangerous and unacceptable"" and a ""flagrant attack on a political solution"" to the Israeli- Palestinian conflict.
The statement by Ahmed Aboul-Gheit, the regional bloc's secretary-general, came after an emergency meeting of foreign ministers from 22 Arab states in Egypt's capital, Cairo, on Saturday.
Aboul-Gheit said Trump's decision was ""against international law and raises questions over American efforts to support peace"" between Palestine and Israel.
The shift in US policy ""undermines Arab confidence"" in the Trump administration and ""amounts to the legalisation"" of the Israeli occupation of Palestine, he added.
Leaders from across the globe made similar remarks in the days before and after Trump's announcement on Wednesday. The US president also ordered the US embassy be moved from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.

The snub over the US' recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital came after Egypt's Coptic Church on Saturday also cancelled an upcoming meeting with Pence in protest against Washington's move on Jerusalem.
The policy change will also see the US embassy to Israel move from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, a decision that has sparked anger and protests throughout the occupied Palestinian territories, and drawn condemnation from world leaders.
On Thursday, a day after US President Donald Trump formally made the announcement, Jibril Rajoub, a senior Fatah politician, said, ""we will not receive him [Pence] in the Palestinian territories"".
Pence's visit to the region involves stops in Egypt, Israel and the West Bank, the White House said in October. The vice president was scheduled to meet Abbas in Bethlehem on December 19.
""In the name of Fatah, I say that we will not welcome Trump's deputy in the Palestinian territories. He asked to meet (Abbas) on the 19th of this month in Bethlehem, such a meeting will not take place,"" Rajoub said.
In a statement later on Sunday, Pence's press secretary Alyssa Farah said it was ""unfortunate"" that the Palestinian Authority (PA) had decided to decline the meeting.
Farah said the PA was ""walking away again from an opportunity to discuss the future of the region"" but that the US remained committed to peace negotiations.
""The administration remains undeterred in its efforts to help achieve peace between Israelis and Palestinians and our peace team remains hard at work putting together a plan,"" she said.
On Wednesday, as Trump made his announcement with his deputy at his side, he spoke about Pence's visit.
""Vice President Pence will travel to the region in the coming days to reaffirm our commitment to work with partners throughout the Middle East to defeat radicalism that threatens the hopes and dreams of future generations,"" Trump said.
A White House official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told Al Jazeera on Friday that Pence still ""intends"" to meet Abbas, noting it ""would be counterproductive"" for the Palestinian leader to cancel the meeting.
Separately, Saeb Erekat, the Palestinian chief negotiator, told Al Jazeera on Friday that Palestinians will not talk to the US until Trump has reversed his decision.
He said the Palestinian leadership was considering all options in response to Trump's announcement.
Trump's embassy move has inflamed the Israel-Palestine conflict, in which the status of Jerusalem is a key issue. The Palestinians see occupied East Jerusalem as the capital of their future state.
In announcing the embassy move, Trump said he remained ""deeply committed"" to finding a peace agreement, noting that the US ""would support a two-state solution if agreed to by both sides"".
Abbas recently met Jordan's King Abdullah II, after which they issued a joint statement noting that ""any measure tampering with the legal and historical status of Jerusalem is invalid"" and warning of the ""dangerous"" repercussions of the embassy move.
On Sunday, violence erupted for a fourth day in the occupied Palestinian territories in response to Trump's announcement. Witnesses said Israeli forces fired tear gas canisters at groups of rallying youth in the Aida refugee camp in Bethlehem.
The protests came after Israeli air raids killed two Palestinians in Gaza on Saturday after fighters reportedly fired rockets from Gaza into Israel on Friday.

Along with her mother and seven siblings, she shared a flimsy tent with strangers.
""The facilities were not hygienic, and the food was not edible,"" she says, sitting in the kitchen of a Syriza party office in Mytilene.
Qias is one of 34 refugees and migrants who have occupied the local office of Syriza, Greece's ruling left-wing party, to protest foul living conditions asylum seekers endure in Moria and other camps.
Local anti-fascist and solidarity activists helped the group in the planning and occupation of the building, and the demonstration has extended two weeks.
""Because the food in Moria was not edible, we continuously suffered from vomiting, diarrhoea and constant dehydration,"" Qias says. ""When we would go to the doctor, the doctor would say everything is fine.""
Built to house some 2,000 people, more than 6,000 refugees and migrants currently live in Moria, on the eastern part of Lesbos Island.
Rights groups and aid organisations have decried the camp's decrepit living conditions, calling on the Greek government to move asylum seekers to the country's mainland.
After a fortnight inside the overcrowded camp, violent clashes between Arab and Afghan refugees prompted Qias, her family and dozens of other refugees to leave.
""During the first fight we saw, 16 of us were in a tent made for eight people,"" she says, explaining the clash was one of 10 fights during her time there.
""It was a massive fight, and they were throwing rocks. The authorities seemed to not want to do anything.""
After they left, dozens of refugees and migrants set up tents in Sappho Square, a central area in Mytilene, for more than a month to protest unsafe conditions in Moria.
Several went on hunger strike during that period.
On November 25, police evicted the refugees from the square after failing the convince them to move to a remote area outside of town.
During that incident, the protesters say police officers struck members of the group and hurled racist insults as they pushed them out.
The refugees also accuse local authorities, including the mayor and deputy mayor, of stoking xenophobia.
Karime Qias, Afghan refugee occupying Syriza office
Lesbos Mayor Spiros Galinos, who has urged the government to transfer asylum seekers to the mainland, led a strike against the presence of refugees on the island on November 27.
At the time of publication, local police had not replied to Al Jazeera's request for a comment.
Following the eviction from Sappho Square, the asylum seekers, mostly Afghans and Iranians, marched through the city before eventually storming and occupying the local Syriza office.
They issued a statement demanding the release of a refugee who was arrested during the Sappho Square altercation and called on the Greek government to lift geographical restrictions that confine the asylum seekers to islands.
They also demanded accommodation in Athens for the duration of their asylum application process.
""They are treating people like animals and slaves and in a very dehumanising way,"" Qias adds. ""We didn't come to Europe to be imprisoned … and have no agency. It's every human's right to have control of their choices.""
Syriza came to power in January 2015 after campaigning on a left-wing programme that included overhauling the country's migration policies.
Yet, the party has come under fire since taking office for reneging on promises and complying with a March 2016 EU-Turkey deal to stem the flow of refugees to Europe.
More than 60,000 refugees and migrants are stranded in Greece due to that agreement and border closures across the Balkan region.
Syriza's Lesbos branch has decried the takeover of its headquarters as ""adventurous"".
In a statement, the party accused the protesters of strengthening ""xenophobic and racist voices"" that have been stoking anti-refugee sentiment on the island.
""This extreme attitude of this small group of refugees does not reflect, and further more does not mirror, the thousands of peaceful refugees and immigrants on our island,"" the statement read.
Arash Hampay
Arash Hampay, a 32-year-old Iranian refugee and the group's spokesperson, says there are two main reasons they decided to occupy Syriza's office.
""Firstly, it is the hall of the ruling party, and it is this government's home,"" he tells Al Jazeera in the squat.
""Secondly, dirty European policies created these conditions for refugees, and it is the 'leftist' government of Greece that is implementing these policies,"" he adds.
""The Greek government has to be held responsible for turning this beautiful island into a concentration camp for refugees.""
Hampay says no aid groups or human rights organisations supported the refugees, including the hunger strikers, during the month-long Sappho Square protest.
One German politician did visit them, however, but urged them to accept the fact that Europe has closed its borders.
Hampay says he replied: ""If Europe wants to close its borders, can it also shut down the arms factories that create refugees as well?""
Although Hampay has asylum in Greece, his brother is still confined to Lesbos while asylum authorities process his application.
Even if his brother is granted permission to leave the island, he says, ""I will stay here until the doors of Moria are finally closed.""

Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has repeatedly snubbed New Zealand's offer to take in 150 out of the 600 refugees who are currently held at detention centres on Papua New Guinea's remote Pacific island.
""Where's the humanity?"" Helen Clark, who served as prime minister from 1999-2008, told Al Jazeera on the sidelines of International Civil Society Week in the Fijian capital, Suva.
""Australia isn't allowing New Zealand to help at all. Our offer to help has still not been accepted.""
Up until late last month, more than 300 men had barricaded themselves in at one of the decommissioned camps on the island, resisting their relocation after a series of violent attacks against refugees by locals.
The men resorted to drinking rainwater and dug their own wells in order to survive, while pleading for other countries to take them in.
Manus Island police stormed the camp on November 23 and, according to witness accounts, used long metal poles to beat the refugees before dragging them out and relocating them to another site.
""When I was prime minister, I offered Australia to take in refugees, and it was accepted,"" Clark said.
""We took in many people, many Afghans, and it was one of the most successful refugee resettlements we had ever done.""
Australia has refused to resettle any refugee that arrived by boat since 2013, instead it pays Papua New Guinea and Nauru to keep them in prisons and has been searching for countries that will resettle them.
Few refugees have accepted offers to resettle in Papua New Guinea or Nauru, a tiny impoverished atoll with a population of 10,000 people.
Australia had hoped the detainees would be either resettled into Papua New Guinea society or the United States, under a controversial refugee swap, by the time the centre closed.
Under the US deal, struck with previous US President Barack Obama and bitterly criticised by his successor Donald Trump, just 54 refugees have been accepted, with 24 flown to the US.
""The situation still unfolding on Manus Island presents a grave risk of further deterioration, and of further damage to extremely vulnerable human beings,"" Thomas Albrecht, the regional UNHCR representative, said in a statement.
""[We] renew [our] call for all Australian parliamentarians and leaders to take immediate action to provide protection and safety for all refugees and asylum-seekers transferred to Papua New Guinea,"" he added.
Clark said New Zealand would not be a ""back door"" to reach Australia, adding it simply ""offered a way out"" for a number of Manus' distraught refugees.
""It seems the offer is not being accepted on the grounds that people will come to New Zealand, get citizenship and then travel to Australia shortly thereafter. Well, once they have a New Zealand passport they can go wherever that passport takes them. That's their right,"" she said.
""We can't have two types of New Zealand passports, one that allows entry to Australia and the other that doesn't.""
The UN and rights groups have for years cited human rights abuses among detainees at the detention centres.
The Papua New Guinea Supreme Court ruled in 2016 the Manus centre was illegal before ordering its closure.
However, human rights groups said the situation for refugees is far from better in New Zealand.
Amnesty International reported that some asylum seekers who had made it to New Zealand had been kept alongside remand prisoners at Auckland's Mount Eden prison and the country's largest jail - Rimutaka.
""There are well known negative, and at times serious physical and psychological, consequences for asylum-seekers in prison detention; there is a risk of violence with refugees and over-stayers being beaten and brutalised by other prisoners and prison guards not assisting,"" Amnesty said.
Last year, a New Zealand tribunal accepted a Somali asylum seeker's claims that he was forced to take part in a ""fight club"" at the Mount Eden prison.
""He was beaten by gang members and forced into gang fights against persons stronger than himself on a weekly basis,"" the tribunal said.
Clark said it was unlikely that New Zealand's decision to take in the refugees would lead to a spike in arrivals by boat.
""Very few spontaneous asylum-seekers try to reach New Zealand by boat,"" she said. ""We're a very, very remote country.""

How can the crisis on Manus Island be resolved?

The status of the holy city is an extremely sensitive aspect of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
While Israel claims the whole city its capital - following the occupation of East Jerusalem in the 1967 war with Syria, Egypt and Jordan - Palestinians have long seen East Jerusalem as the capital of their future state.
""Jerusalem was lost from the day Sadaat visited it and the day you all danced for Oslo,"" wrote Mourid Barghouti, a celebrated Palestinian poet and writer, referring to Egyptian President Anwar Sadat and the Oslo Accords.
ضاعت القدس يوم زارها السادات ويوم رقصتم لأوسلو. #القدس #ترامب #نقل_السفارة
When Sadat took over the presidency in Egypt in 1970, he offered a peace settlement with Israel along the lines of UN Resolution 242, which, more or less, cemented Israel's military victory.
As for the Oslo Accords, in 1993, the State of Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) formally recognised one another for the first time, and committed to negotiate a solution to their decades-long conflict based on territorial compromise.
The accords did not stipulate, but implied, the creation of a Palestinian state alongside Israel. That two-state vision required Israel to abandon its negation of Palestinian claims to national sovereignty, and Palestinians accept that such claims would be limited to only a small part of the entire territory of historic Palestine for which the PLO had been fighting, recognising Israel’s sovereignty over the remainder.
""Oh Arabs and Muslims, Bolivia will ask for an emergency security council meeting in the event that Trump recognises Jerusalem the capital of Israel. Where is the Arab representative in the security council to call for such a meeting?"" said Abdullah K. AlShayji, a professor at Kuwait University.
يا عرب ويامسلمين #بوليفيا ستطلب عقد اجتماع عاجل لمجلس الأمن في حال أعترف #ترامب ب #القدس عاصمة ل #إسرائيل!! وين ممثل المجموعة العربية في مجلس الأمن #مصر من الدعوة لاجتماع طاريءلمجلس الأمن؟!
Bolivia said it would request a meeting of the United Nations Security Council after Trump's announcement on Wednesday, with Sacha Sergio Llorentty Soliz, UN ambassador, describing the move as a ""reckless and a dangerous decision that goes against international law, the resolutions of the Security Council, it also weakens any effort for peace in the region and also upsets the whole region"".
Abdullah Hamidaddin, a social anthropologist, said: ""Trump deals a blow to the Arabs and Muslims and calls on them to accept it quietly. He throws resolution 242 against a wall and insists that the US is with the peace process. He hopes the moderates can do their part, then the extremists can cut off the argument of the moderates. He says Israel is the greatest democracy because it practices apartheid and violates human rights.""
#ترامب: يصفع كرامة العرب والمسلمين ويدعوهم لتلقيها بهدوء. يرمي القرار 242 عرض الحائط ويصر أن أمريكا مع السلام. يأمل من المعتدلين القيام بدورهم ثم يُمكّن المتطرفين ويقطع حجة المعتدلين. يقول إسرائيل أعظم ديمقراطية لأنها تمارس الفصل العنصري وتُنتهك حقوق الإنسان.
The United Nations Security Council adopted Resolution 242 on November 22, 1967, calling for the ""withdrawal of Israeli armed forces from territories occupied in the recent conflict"". It emphasised ""the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by war and the need to work for a just and lasting peace in the Middle East in which every State in the area can live in security"".
While all parties ultimately accepted the resolution, it took two decades for the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) to do so. The PLO criticised the resolution for viewing Palestinians only as refugees, and not as a people with national rights.
""There is no way Trump could have undertaken this decision without studying and making sure that the Arabs will not really mind..and if they did, they won't be able to do anything about it!,"" said Mohamd Nashwan, a Gaza-based writer.
لا يمكن ل #ترامب أن يتخذ مثل هذا القرار إلا بعد دراسة كبيرة و التأكد أن العرب لن يمانعوا ممانعة حقيقية.. وإن مانعوا، فلن يستطيعوا فعل أي شيء!#القدس_عاصمة_فلسطين_الأبدية
""As the world rejects and condemns Trump's decision, we find the conspirators also riding this wave of condemnation,"" said user @BoMuhannd.

While most lamented Trump's move, some used the moment to criticise Palestinians.
""The Palestinians do not sympathise with you or your causes. Instead they line up next to your enemies because they simply hate you. But despite that they ask you to sympathise with their cause,"" said Saleh Al Fahid, a journalist.

The attack took place amid deepening Islamophobia in Poland, where Muslims comprise a mere 0.1 percent of the population.
CCTV footage confirmed the incident, but in the darkness of night, the attackers' faces are unrecognisable.
""I hope that the perpetrators will be caught soon"", said Mariusz Blaszczak, minister of interior.
So far, the men have not been named.
Anna Lukjanowicz, Polish Muslim convert
""This was not the first attack against our centre,"" said Anna Lukjanowicz, a Polish convert to Islam who works at the institute, citing three previous attacks.
In October this year, a masked man threw a bottle against the front door, leaving visible marks.
""Recent events are part of a politically fuelled, unpleasant atmosphere of xenophobia and racism in Poland,"" she told Al Jazeera. ""Because of the verbal and physical attacks against not only Muslims, but also people who 'look like Muslims' - that is people with a darker skin, and the attack against the Muslim Culture Centre, Muslims living in Poland are losing the sense of security.""
Completed in 2015, the centre's architecture blends Middle Eastern tradition and European trends.
It hosts conference halls, a library and the largest prayer room in Poland, with space for 600 people.
At the beginning of 2017, the centre's employees wrote to Polish officials, including the president, the prime minister, both chambers of parliament and all parliamentary parties, expressing their concern with the ""biased media coverage of Islam and its people"" as well as the ""consolidation of anti-Muslim attitudes"" in the political debate.
According to the authors, these could lead to the increase in xenophobia and violence against Muslims.
In, 2016, police figures revealed the second highest number of hate crime incidents after 2015, with 765 reported cases of violence. In 2014, police recorded 262 incidents.
In 2016, local prosecutor offices investigated 1,631 hate crimes fuelled by racism, anti-Semitism or xenophobia.
Since 2015, the number of attacks against Muslims rose from 192 to 362, followed by attacks against Jews and Roma people.
In May 2016, Prime Minister Beata Szydlo abolished an anti-discrimination council that was tasked with preventing xenophobia and intolerance.
The Muslim cultural centre's letters generated little response from the authorities. In the only reply, in spite of evidence to the contrary, the office of the Senate said physical attacks against the centre were unlikely.
Anna Tatar, from the anti-racist Never Again Association
""Facts from the Polish tradition and history show that Christian Orthodox people, Protestants, Jews, Tatars, Ukrainians and Belarusians lived in peace with Poles in our country, making a great contribution to its development,"" the response read.
""Apart from reporting on worrying events, which take place in some countries of Western Europe, we have not noticed any references towards the Muslim community, which has been living in Poland for years, that would be worth condemning"".
However, according to Anna Tatar from the anti-racist Never Again Association, which has been monitoring hate crime incidents in Poland since the 1990s, the political narrative in response to the refugee crisis has contributed to the increase in anti-Muslim sentiment in Poland.
""The main reason for this change is the way the Polish debate about the humanitarian crisis and the possible acceptance of refugees was conducted. This is a problem which does not concern Poland at all because there are almost no refugees here, but the hysterical way in which the issue was discussed, used and manipulated for political ends has contributed to the increase in violence,"" Tatar said.
""There are a number of examples of statements made by representatives of the authorities, which show that they do not want to see the problem or that they neglect it. For example, at the recent 'Independence March', a number of openly racist banners were present. Yet, there was virtually no explicit condemnation of the events,"" she said, an opinion shared by the wider Muslim community.
Some 60,000 people joined the ""Independence March"" attended by some nationalists and fascists in Warsaw on November 11 - more people than the Polish Muslim population of around 35,000 - where chants included: ""The whole Poland sings with us: f*** off with the refugees.""
""Public media and nationalist internet sites discriminate against Islam and Muslims and manipulate the public opinion, trying to convince Poles that Islam is a religion of violence, terror, that it is primitive,"" said Imam Youssef Hadid, Chairman of the Supreme Council of the Muslim League in Poland.
""There are debates and lectures which spread hatred towards Muslims, people who are invited to speak at them have xenophobic and Islamophobic views, have no knowledge of Islam, and those who specialise in it are not invited.""
A study by the Center for Research on Prejudice published in September 2015, found that although 80 percent of Poles do not know any Muslims, two-thirds declare that they would feel uncomfortable in their presence.
More than half of respondents stated that Muslims threaten Poland's economic well-being and Polish values, and a similar number agreed with Islamophobic statements. Younger respondents demonstrated a higher level of fear.
""What we are currently observing is a moral panic. Polish society is easy to manipulate. Public opinion polls show that we are the first in the EU when it comes to viewing social media as a reliable source of information about the world. Over half of Poles trust social media,"" said Adam Balcer, a Warsaw-based researcher for the European Council on Foreign Relations. ""The Polish internet is very right wing and nationalistic, and as a result, Polish youth has a negative attitude towards Muslims.""
Since the country has one of the most ethnically and religiously homogenous societies in Europe with a small Muslim minority, the right wing plays on irrational fears.
""The authorities, which are openly Islamophobic, set the example. This falls on a fertile ground of fears and phobias, which reflect some deeply rooted stereotypes,"" said Balcer.
He compared the current atmosphere to the interwar period and the existing attitudes towards Muslims to the earlier situation of Jews.
""A Jew used to be portrayed as oriental, the other, an eastern man, incapable of assimilating and integrating, who could destroy the nation,"" he explained.
""Those cliches only had to be revived. You can see them in the current fears of the Law and Justice's electorate which include the alliance of [George] Soros and the Germans to destroy Poland's ethnic cohesion by bringing in refugees"".
Following the attack at the Muslim cultural centre, some Poles sent messages condemning the incident and expressing solidarity. Others arrived at the scene and brought candles.
On November 29, a group of activists organised a protest in Warsaw under the slogan ""No to Islamophobia"".
Representatives of the Jewish community have also expressed their regret concerning the attack, acknowledging the rise in negative attitudes towards minorities in Poland.
""Poles are a hospitable nation, they are tolerant and respectful of people of other faiths, but unfortunately politics pushes them to spread nationalism and hate towards Muslims,"" Imam Hadid said.

A freight train struck Madina Husein on November 21 in Serbia near the border town of Sid, after Croatian police forced the family to return to Serbia.
Earlier, at around 6pm (17:00 GMT) that evening when temperatures had plummeted, police had found the family attempting to cross into Croatia in a bid to reach Europe. They took them to a police station for questioning.
Madina's mother, who was travelling with her other children as well, begged local officials to let them leave in the morning because they were tired after walking for hours.
But Croatian authorities refused this request.
Croatian police took them to Serbia from the town of Tovarnik and, at 8pm (19:00 GMT), told the family to walk along the train line back to Sid. Madina was killed on that journey.
The child's 15-year-old brother found her body metres from where she was hit.
""My mother was scared that my little brothers and sisters would not be able to see where they were going in the night,"" Nilab Husein, Madina's 17-year-old sister, told Al Jazeera.
Speaking from a refugee centre in Principovac, she added: ""When Madina was hit, and we found her body, the officers who deported my family called an ambulance.
""But my mother was not allowed to go in the ambulance, even when she told the officers that she was prepared to leave her [other] children to be with Madina.""
Croatia's interior ministry confirmed the death on its website, describing it as ""regrettable"" and denying that border police were responsible. The government has said the family returned to Serbia voluntarily.
Croatian activists say the border area is unlit, meaning the family was walking in the dark.
According to Doctors Without Borders (MSF), seven people, including three children, have died on the Croatia-Serbia border in 2017 on the train line between Tovarnik and Sid, either by moving trains or electrocution.
After Madina was hit, the family was made to wait in a forest for almost one hour. From there, Serbian police officers took them to Belgrade.
""My mother asked the Serbian police which hospital Madina was in, and they said they didn't know,"" said Nilab.
""They wanted to do everything behind closed doors and hide that my sister's death took place. The way they treat refugees is like we are not human.""
Serbian authorities took four days to notify the family of Madina's death and did not allow the child to be buried in the capital, Belgrade, where they had hoped to hold a service with the Afghan refugee community.
The family also claims they were given four bottles of water to perform Muslim funeral rites, which involve washing the body, and threatened them with deportation if they refused to bury Madina in a Christian cemetery in Sid.
By the time of publishing, Serbian government officials had not responded to Al Jazeera's request for comment.
An aid worker involved in Madina's case, who requested anonymity, told Al Jazeera that the Serbian government often attempts to ""cover up its abuses to migrants"".
""There is no flexibility from authorities here towards refugees. They are literally not treated like fellow humans who in this case are mourning,"" he said.
""Mourning is a process that needs the rituals, not because people are being pigheaded, but because rituals give closure.""
Croatian police have previously been accused of using violence to force migrants and refugees back to Serbia.
According to the UN, there are around 7,000 refugees currently in Serbia - around half are children.
Migrants and asylum seekers have stopped travelling through the so-called Balkan route after Hungary and other countries closed their borders to migrants in March 2016.
Thousands were left stranded in Serbia, including women and children, and are now exposed to extreme weather conditions with the onset of winter.

Rubbish, used toilet paper, urine-filled water bottles, dirty nappies and human faeces are scattered across the field.
Al-Talaa, a 30-year-old Syrian who arrived in Greece last month, is one of the hundreds of refugees and migrants who have moved to the olive grove because conditions inside the camp are cramped and decrepit.
He knew the journey from Syria would be arduous. After the government recently intensified its campaign to drive the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL, also known as ISIS) from his battle-ravaged hometown of Deir Az Zor, he decided to pack up and seek safety in Europe.
Jalal Ahmed al-Talaa, Syrian refugee
He paid smugglers and bribed fighters to cross checkpoints along the way. His wife gave birth to his now one-month-old son in an undersupplied clinic in rebel-controlled Idlib. They eventually reached Turkey and took a flimsy dinghy to Greece's Lesbos Island.
Despite the dangers he knew they would face along the way, he hoped to bring his family to safety in Germany, where his brother found refuge two years ago.
What he did not expect was to end up sleeping outside with his wife and newborn son in the cold and rainy weather next to a camp plagued by illnesses, police mistreatment and violence between refugees.
""I knew the island was bad, but I didn't imagine it was this awful,"" he says. ""I didn't imagine you had to wait two hours to go to the toilet.""
Tents are spread across the olive grove. A group of children chase each other between the tarps and sheets strung up to divide families' living areas, while others kick a football back and forth on the rocky terrain.
Across the street, young men use a single hose to wash themselves and their clothes as a strong wind blows through the area.
Like others stuck at Moria, al-Talaa spends his days sitting around his tent and waiting in lengthy queues for food and to see the camp's medical staff.
""It's very bad here,"" he says, ""and people with special cases, such as injuries or newborns, need to be allowed to move on to Athens.""
He adds: ""Whenever you tell the doctor something is wrong, they only say you should drink more water.""
Following the March 2016 agreement to stem refugee flows between the European Union and Turkey, the Greek government confined refugees and migrants to the islands for the duration of their asylum process. Only asylum seekers with emergency cases can travel to the mainland.
That same month, countries across the Balkans sealed their borders, leaving more than 60,000 refugees and migrants stranded in Greece.
With cold and snowy weather approaching, rights groups and aid organisations have called on Greece to improve the plummeting living conditions in camps on several Greek islands, citing deaths in several camps last winter. At least three died in Moria alone, but residents claimed the number was higher.
Last week, the government moved hundreds of refugees to the mainland hoping to ease the pressure on the islands, where xenophobic and anti-refugee sentiment is growing.
""The conditions are certainly not suitable for winter in many of the hot spots [camps] that are dangerously overcrowded,"" says Ashleigh Lovett, regional advocacy coordinator for the International Rescue Committee (IRC). ""People don't have access to basic services, toilets, showers and healthcare, which they need.""
She added: ""I think there is a real risk that lives will be lost if people are not moved to the mainland.""
At the time of publication, Greece's migration ministry did not respond to Al Jazeera's request for a comment.
Moria, which was built to accommodate 2,000 people, now hosts upwards of 6,000 asylum seekers, according to the United Nations refugee agency (UNHCR).
""Right now, it is dangerous for children, families, and vulnerable people to stay in Moria,"" says UNHCR spokesperson Boris Cheshirkov. ""Conditions could still deteriorate if overcrowding persists and as colder weather sets in.
Home to 90,000 Greeks, Lesbos hosts an estimated 8,500 refugees and migrants, according to Mayor Spyros Galinos, who says ""urgent action is needed"" to relieve widespread suffering.
""The islands of North Aegean need to be immediately decongested from refugees, who need to be transferred to mainland Greece,"" Galinos tells Al Jazeera.
Back in the field outside Moria, Abu Mohammed al-Qallab, a 41-year-old from Syria's Deraa, gathers firewood for the evening.
Al-Qallab, a pro-opposition activist who says he was arrested and tortured by the Syrian government, explains that ""it gets very cold here at night"".
The former high school teacher, who arrived in Lesbos a month ago, wears a sanitary mask because he recently came down with influenza.
He makes his way through the impromptu camp next to Moria, collecting large stones and pieces of wood to raise his tent and prevent rain from coming inside.
On the barbwire fence enclosing the camp, there are t-shirts, trousers and underwear out to dry.
""The food is awful here,"" he says, ""and we wait two hours [in the morning] for a piece of bread and an apple.""
Pausing to cough, he points in the direction of the camp. ""This is a big prison.""
As al-Qallab speaks, a man passes by and says, in English: ""Moria no good.""
Across town, in a building recently squatted by dozens of Afghan and Iranian refugees who left Moria, 16-year-old Ely Qias says she hoped to study when she reached Europe.
After enduring years of war in Afghanistan's Helmand province, Ely, her mother and seven siblings travelled by foot from Afghanistan through the mountains of Iran to Turkey. They took an overcrowded boat to Lesbos just over two months ago.
Along with another family, they lived in a tent that housed 20 people inside Moria for two weeks before leaving the camp after violent clashes broke one evening.
""The toilets were very dirty, and the shower was worse,"" she says. ""Animals couldn't use the shower there,"" she says.

Sixty-five years later, another leader's name will be added this week to that exclusive list.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who hadn't even been born at the time of Bayar's trip, will land in the Greek capital on Thursday for a landmark two-day visit aimed at keeping dialogue open between two countries that have traditionally been at odds over a number of thorny issues.
""Without a doubt, President Erdogan's visit is historic,"" said Alexandra Voudouri, a foreign policy expert at MacroPolis, an Athens-based political and economic analysis website.
""It is significant, mainly for its symbolism … and comes at an extremely crucial time for the developments in the wider region,"" she told Al Jazeera.
The two NATO allies have long shared a tumultuous relationship, fuelled by historical rivalries and mutual distrust stretching back centuries.
Greeks lived under Ottoman rule for some 400 years, before fighting and winning independence in the 1820s and 30s. About 100 years later, the Republic of Turkey was founded by Kemal Ataturk following the defeat and expulsion of Greek forces from Anatolia by his troops.
Since then, the two neighbours have lurched through the decades surrounded by militarised disputes and bitter prejudices - as well as the occasional rapprochement.
At the worst of times, they have come close to war, as happened in 1996 over conflicting ownership claims over unpopulated islets in the Aegean Sea.
At the best of times, they have sought warmer ties, as in 1999 after successive deadly tremors in both countries sparked an outpouring of mutual sympathy and a political willingness to address differences in the so-called earthquake diplomacy that followed.
Trade and cultural ties have since been strengthened, and channels of communication remained open, with an increasing number of meetings at the foreign minister and prime minister level taking place over the past few years.
Erdogan himself last visited Greece in 2010, when he was prime minister.
""The relationship between Greece and Turkey has always been marked by ups and downs,"" Emmanuel Karagiannis, a senior lecturer at King's College London, told Al Jazeera.
""The current phase can be characterised as 'Cold Peace'. The two countries have maintained high-level exchanges, but tensions remain high.""
At the heart of the strained ties, beyond disputes over maritime and airspace rights in the Aegean, lies Cyprus.
The Mediterranean island has been effectively divided since an Athens-backed coup in 1974 and a subsequent Turkish invasion.
Since then, its Greek- and Turkish-Cypriot communities have lived on either side of a 180km-long, UN-monitored, ceasefire line cutting across the island, while repeated diplomatic efforts to end the partition, which also involve Greece and Turkey as guarantor powers, have failed.
The most recent reunification bid, described as the best chance to broker a deal in generations, collapsed dramatically last summer - and analysts believe nothing substantial will come out of the upcoming talks in Athens.
""No one should expect a miraculous effect on the Cyprus issue,"" Sinem Akgul Acikmese, professor of international relations at Istanbul's Kadir Has University, told Al Jazeera.
Analysts in Greece agreed, pointing out that nothing will change before the Greek-Cypriot presidential elections in early 2018.
""I estimate that there might be an attempt for some kind of informal understanding to lay the ground that, in the case of any future favourable conditions for the resuming of the talks, the mistakes and omissions of the past will not be repeated,"" Aggelos Athanasopoulos, senior diplomatic and European Union affairs editor at Greek daily To Vima, told Al Jazeera.
During his time in Athens, Erdogan will meet Prokopis Pavlopoulos, his Greek counterpart holding a largely ceremonial post, before having high-level discussions with Alexis Tsipras, Greece's prime minister.
Erdogan will also head to Thrace, a region in northeastern Greece with a Muslim minority. There, he will attend Friday prayers at a mosque in the city of Komotini.
Ahead of the talks, diplomats from both countries hailed the focus on the ""positive development of the relations through dialogue at the highest level"".
In their meeting, Tsipras, 43, and Erdogan, 63, are expected to discuss issues of mutual interest, including ways to advance trade and economic ties, as well as cooperate on transport, culture and tourism.
However, no major breakthrough is expected in any of the long-standing contentious issues.
""Keeping dialogue widely open through such a positive agenda has obvious significance,"" said Acikmese. ""However, it is over-realistic to foresee 'a new chapter' in bilateral relations with such pragmatic dialogue channels as long as there is no political settlement on issues of conflict between the two sides.""
The two leaders will also discuss regional security and ""terrorism"", but another topic high on the agenda of both sides will be the refugee crisis.
In March 2016, the European Union - of which Greece is a member - and Turkey signed a controversial deal aimed at stemming the influx of refugees to Europe.
The agreement, which sees Greece and Turkey carry almost all the responsibility, has led to a sharp decrease in arrivals compared with the height of the crisis in 2015.
Erdogan has previously accused the bloc of not keeping its side of the deal about visa-free travel for Turkish citizens.
Turkey hosts nearly three million Syrian refugees, and Erdogan has also threatened to open the country's border gates with the EU for refugees to pass freely.
With Greece still struggling to cope and arrivals picking up lately, Voudouri said the Greek side at the talks ""will insist on preserving the deal to avoid a return to the situation of 2015 and early 2016"", when more than one million people crossed into the country.
""Greece wants to put an emphasis on this and secure Turkey's compliance with the deal because there is a big concern over the size of migrant flows by boat from Turkey,"" added Athanasopoulos. ""The situation on the islands has reached a tipping point.""
Hotspots on the islands of Lesbos, Samos and Chios are hosting up to three times as many people as they were designed to accommodate. With winter approaching, human rights groups are sounding warnings over deteriorating conditions in the islands' cramped and dangerous camps.
For his part, Erdogan is expected to renew a Turkish call for the extradition of eight soldiers who fled to Greece in a military helicopter and sought asylum as a failed coup attempt was under way in July 2016.
Earlier this year, Greece's top court ruled against extraditing the officers, drawing an angry response from Ankara which said it would review its ties with Athens.
Tsipras has maintained that the decision by the Greek justice system must be respected.
While it is certain that Erdogan's trip will dominate discussions in Greece and Turkey, his statements in Athens will also be closely watched in diplomatic circles further away - from Brussels, through Berlin, to Washington, DC.
His visit comes at a time of worsening relations between Turkey and some of its Western allies, including the US.
In recent months, Turkish and EU officials have also been locked in an escalating war of words, with Ankara accusing some member states of backing ""terrorism"" and bloc leaders alleging a deterioration of democratic and human rights in Turkey in the wake of the failed coup attempt.
""Erdogan's visit to Athens is one of the few official trips to an EU member country in the last couple of years on a bilateral basis, specifically at a time of nearly lost hopes in Turkey's EU accession process,"" said Acikmese.
Turkey applied for EU membership in 1987 and began accession talks in 2005.
However, negotiations have been essentially frozen over the past decade, with no progress made.
Amid the stalemate, Erdogan said recently that Turkey ""does not need the EU"" any more, while also accusing the German and Dutch governments of ""Nazi practices"" after they prevented Turkish ministers from speaking at expatriate rallies ahead of a referendum.
Acikmese said, ""even though some claim that this [visit to Athens] is a signal of slightly turning towards Europe ... it would be too early and equally naive to make such comments"".
Despite the heightened tensions, Ankara says that cutting off EU membership negotiations would harm both sides.
In Athens, Erdogan is expected to continue seeking the support of Greece, which has traditionally maintained that it backs Turkey's EU ambitions.
In October, during a visit to the US, Tsipras reiterated its long-stated foreign policy that it ""supported the Turkish course towards Europe"".
Athanasopoulos, the Athens-based journalist, argues that Greece's backing for Turkey's European perspective is crucial for Greek interests, but notes that its influence might be limited due to EU dithering.
""The Europeans are confused about how to approach Turkey,"" he said.
""On the one hand, they seek close relations because they are worried about the refugee crisis. But on the other [hand], they raise concerns about issues like the rule of law and human rights which, coupled with the [heated] rhetoric, do not allow for the development of such ties.""

Hundreds of Palestinians took to the streets in Gaza City on Wednesday, carrying banners denouncing Trump, hours ahead of his declaration that will also see the US embassy move from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.
The declaration comes amid global condemnation of the decision.
Speaking to Al Jazeera from Gaza, Hamas leader Ismail Haniya described Trump's decision as a ""flagrant aggression"".
""This decision is an uncalculated gamble that will know no limit to the Palestinian, Arab and Muslim reaction,"" he said.
""We call for stopping this decision fully because this will usher in the beginning of a time of terrible transformations, not just on the Palestinian level but on the region as a whole. This decision means the official announcement of the end of the peace process.""
Al Jazeera's Bernard Smith, reporting from Gaza, said people did not bother to wait for the announcement and spontaneously gathered to protest against the plans.
""This is an indication of what might come after Trump speaks later today. People here compared the protests to a small ball of fire that would roll and turn into a much larger ball later on,"" Smith said.
""The move by the US seems to have further unified the Palestinians. Hamas and the smaller factions in Gaza have given their full support to Mahmoud Abbas' Fattah movement in their opposition to the US move. There is full unity on the Palestinian streets behind this cause,"" he added.
Resistance groups in Gaza called on the Palestine Liberation Organization to withdraw its recognition of Israel in response to Trump's expected move.
""At a time when the city of Jerusalem is subjected to systematic Judaisation, and our people are exposed to suffering from repression, displacement and exile, comes the American decision to declare the city of Jerusalem as the capital of [Israel] in violation of all international conventions and norms,"" the factions said in a statement.
In Lebanon's capital, Beirut, hundreds of demonstrators gathered in the Palestinian refugee camp Bourj el-Barajneh to protest against Trump.
Jerusalem remains at the core of the perennial Israel-Palestine conflict as Palestinians want Israeli-occupied East Jerusalem as the capital of their future state.
Leaders in the Middle East and elsewhere warned Trump that his plans would have grave implications for the so-called peace process and on regional stability.
Hours ahead of Trump's expected announcement, British Prime Minister Theresa May said she intended to speak to the US president about the status of Jerusalem, adding that the fate of the city should be determined through negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians.
""Jerusalem should ultimately form a shared capital between the Israeli and Palestinian states,"" said May.
Earlier on Wednesday, Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said the US move was ""because of their incompetence and failure"", while the Syrian foreign ministry released a statement saying: ""[The move] is the culmination of the crime of usurping Palestine and displacing the Palestinian people.""
In his weekly address, Pope Francis said that the status quo that governs Jerusalem's al-Aqsa Mosque compound should be respected. Jordan has been the custodian of all Muslim and Christian sites in Jerusalem since 1994.
US officials said that Trump ""remains committed to achieving a lasting peace agreement between the Israelis and Palestinians and is optimistic that peace can be achieved"".
One official said that Trump's decision ""doesn't change the status quo with respect to the holy sites and other sensitive issues"".
But Ali Abunimah of the Electronic Intifada said that one would have to be ""living on another planet for the last few decades to believe that the US was ever an honest broker"".
""What [Trump's move] achieves is truth in advertising,"" he told Al Jazeera.
""It is a more honest expression of American policy, which is to support Israel unconditionally, including Israel's illegal colonisation and settlement-building in East Jerusalem,"" he said, adding that ""this has effectively been US policy for many, many years and Trump is simply coming out and being open about it"".

The court, with two of its nine justices dissenting, said in an order Monday that the policy can take full effect, even as legal challenges against it make their way through the courts.
The ban applies to people from Chad, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria and Yemen.
Unveiled in September, the latest ban was immediately challenged in federal appeals courts in Richmond, Virginia and San Francisco, California.
Lower courts said in October, just a day before the ban was set to come into full effect that that, the portions of the ban should be put on hold while the challenges proceed.
But Monday's order by the Supreme Court suspended the lower courts' injunctions, allowing the ban to take effect.
The court said the appeals courts in San Francisco and Richmond should act swiftly to determine the legality of the ban.
The ban is the third attempt by the Trump administration to restrict individuals from several countries from coming to the US.
Lower courts had previously limited the scope of the ban to individuals without a ""bona fide"" relationship with someone in the US.
In July, the US Department of State expanded its definition of ""close family"" to include grandparents and other relatives that constitute a ""bona fide"" US relationship for visa applicants and refugees from the six countries.
The ban has been widely criticised by human rights and refugee advocacy groups.
The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), which is challenging the ban, said on Twitter that Monday's decision ""is not a ruling on the merits"".
It added that it would ""continue to fight for freedom and equality and for those who are unfairly being separated from their loved ones"".
Karen Tumlin, the legal director for the National Immigration Law Center, echoed that sentiment, saying ""it is important to remember that the Supreme Court has not addressed the legal merits of the latest Muslim ban nor the human impacts with its order today"".
It's important to remember that the Supreme Court has NOT addressed the legal merits of the latest Muslim Ban nor the human impacts w/its order today. Those will be before 2 federal courts of appeal this week. The fight continues. #NoMuslimBanEver
The latest ban also includes restrictions on individuals from North Korea and some officials from Venezuela. The courts had already allowed those provisions to take effect.
The White House maintains the ban targets individuals from countries that have failed to provide enough information to allow for proper vetting of prospective travellers.

Fifteen-year-old Khartoun* told Al Jazeera she was sold into sex slavery after she arrived in Bangladesh by boat to escape a brutal military crackdown.
She was alone - her mother, father and sister had been killed by a mortar shell fired by the Myanmar military during a sweeping crackdown against Rohingya people. Upon Khartoun's arrival in September, two women approached her on the beach and told her they would help her.
""They told me if I went with them they would look after me and help me find a husband,"" Khartoun said.
Instead, she was locked up for three weeks and sold to a Bangladeshi man, who she said, raped her and sexually abused her for 12 days.
""He said 'I will choke you, I will stab you. I will kill you … Do you want to be killed the way the military kill people in Myanmar? I won't let you go,'"" Khartoun told Al Jazeera.
The UN and aid agencies said labour and sex trafficking in refugee camps have gotten worse with the recent influx of more than 620,000 Rohingya.
The military unleashed a campaign of mass murder, rape and arson against the persecuted community after army bases came under attack from Rohingya fighters. The UN has said the army offensive amounted to ethnic cleansing.
Olivia Headon of the International Organisation for Migration said urgent action was required to keep women and girls safe in Bangladesh's refugee camps.
""There's been recruiters here in Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh, previous to this influx and we know they are getting more business,"" she told Al Jazeera. ""And we know that new criminal networks have kicked into action.""
A local aid agency that led Al Jazeera to Khartoun said its staff working with trafficking victims have received death threats from criminal gangs.
The organisation, which did not want to be named for fear of reprisal, said some girls as young as 13 have been abducted by the traffickers.
The man who bought Khartoun returned her to the women who sold her after 12 days. They left her at the Kutupalong refugee camp, where she now lives.
In 2015, Thai authorities uncovered extensive networks which trafficked Rohingya and held them for ransom in jungle camps after discovering 36 bodies in shallow graves along the Thai-Malaysian border.
An army general in Thailand and dozens of others were convicted over the case in July.

The US has been a part of the non-binding New York Declaration for Refugees and Migrants since it was unanimously adopted by the UN General Assembly last year.
The declaration called for negotiations on a Global Compact for Migration, aimed at protecting the rights of refugees and migrants and helping them resettle.
It also seeks to fight xenophobia, racism and discrimination towards refugees and migrants.
But late on Saturday, US Ambassador to the UN, Nikki Haley, said the declaration's ""approach is simply not compatible with US sovereignty"" and that the US will instead define its own migration plan.
""No country has done more than the United States, and our generosity will continue,"" Haley said in a statement.
""But our decisions on immigration policies must always be made by Americans and Americans alone,"" she added.
""We will decide how best to control our borders and who will be allowed to enter our country.""
The UN General Assembly president said he was disappointed with the decision.
""I regret [the] US decision to disengage from [the] process leading to a UN global compact on migration,"" Miroslav Lajcak tweeted after the decision was announced.
His spokesperson said in a statement that the ""role of the United States in this process is critical as it has historically and generously welcomed people from all across the globe and remains home to the largest number of international migrants in the world"".
He added that the US ""has the experience and expertise to help ensure that this process leads to a successful outcome"".
Trump has been under fire by many rights groups for his policies towards refugees since taking office.
In January, he signed an executive order that temporarily banned Syrian refugees from entering the country. The move was challenged in the courts and later revised to include all refugees.
In October, the ban ended, but the White House announced that the US would temporarily delay processing for refugees from 11 ""high-risk"" countries.
The refugees and migration compact is the fourth initiative the United States has withdrawn from this year.
In August, Trump said he was pulling the US out of the Paris Climate Agreement.
The US has also withdrawn from the Trans-Pacific Partnership and UNESCO, the UN organisation which aims to improve education and preserve cultural heritage worldwide.

A plan by Bangladesh and Myanmar is being sketched out to repatriate hundreds of thousands of refugees.
The repatriation will reportedly be voluntary, but only after identification of each refugee has been verified by the Myanmar authorities.

Critics had decried his avoidance of speaking about the months-long persecution of the Rohingya during his four-day visit to Myanmar.
But as he met a multi-faith group in Dhaka on Friday, at St Mary's Cathedral, he told refugees: ""The presence of God today is also called Rohingya.""
Francis listened to the suffering and experiences of 16 refugees - 12 men, two women and two young girls - who approached him one by one.
""We have realised that your sufferings are very deep,"" he said, ""We all want peace. We are working to establish peace where there are ill.""
Foyez Ali Majhi, a refugee from Balukhali camp who met Francis, told Al Jazeera that he asked him to ""inform the world about their suffering"".
Foyez said the Myanmar military killed and raped their families and neighbours.
""Our houses were burnt and they [Myanmar military] have taken everything,"" he said.
""I told the pope to get justice for us.""
Abul Syed, another Rohingya refugee who met Francis, said that they talked about certain demands.
""The main one is to give us our identity back,"" Syed said. ""We want our 'Rohingya' nationality in Myanmar.""
Syed told Al Jazeera that unless the Rohingya people are given their ""identity"", nothing will change in Rakhine state, from where most of the Rohingya have fled.
""If we go back there without identity, we will never be safe. I told the pope about it,"" he said.
Syed, speaking on behalf of the Rohingya refugee group, said they demanded that Myanmar ensure the safe and secure repatriation of all the Rohingya who have fled.
""The pope had listened to us and he said he would talk about our demands to the world stage,"" Syed said.
Rahmat Ullah, speaking to Al Jazeera by phone in Kutupalong camp in Cox's Bazaar, said he was aware of Francis' meeting with ""some of the refugees"" from the camps.
""The ones [Rohingya refugees] who went there [in Dhaka] are educated ones,"" Ullah said. ""We have trust in them that they would talk about our sufferings to him.""
In the past, Francis - whose papacy so far has been widely characterised by advocacy for refugees and vulnerable minorities - has repeatedly condemned violence against the mostly Muslim minority, calling them ""our Rohingya brothers and sisters"" and labelling the Christians who refuse to treat them humanely as ""hypocrites"".
But he came under fire after meeting with Myanmar's de-facto leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, and failing to mention the minority in his speech.
Meanwhile, Muhsena, a young girl, said she is not sure about what good Francis' visit will be.
""Lots of important people have come to the camps in the last two months, but here we still remain, suffering to live our lives on a daily basis,"" she said.
More than 600,000 Rohingya have fled to neighbouring Bangladesh in fear of abuses by Myanmar soldiers.
The ethnic group is subject to a raft of discriminatory measures by Myanmar's government, such as being deprived of citizenship.
Journalists and human rights groups have documented widespread rape, killing, and destruction of homes by government troops but Aung San Suu Kyi has yet to recognise the atrocities and condemn the Myanmar military.

The facility on Lesbos was built to host 2,000 people, but it is now home to three times as many.
The conditions are so harsh that some refugees say they are willing to hurt themselves in the hope of being removed from the camp.
""I know of some people who cut themselves so that doctors can see they're ill and let them go,"" said Abdullah Talib, a refugee from Baghdad.
That's a phenomenon the camp's doctor, Dimitris Patestos, said he has seen many times in the four years he's worked there.
""It's true, they do these things. They're quite common,"" Patestos told Al Jazeera. ""For all the years I've been here this has been going on.""
More than one million refugees have passed through Greece since 2015, often on their way to other countries in Europe.
As refugees stranded on Lesbos face the unforgiving winter months, the local mayor has accused the Greek government of wanting to turn the island into the ""Guantanamo Bay of Europe"".
However, the government says it is not getting enough help from the European Union to mitigate the refugee crisis.
Many refugees in the camp suffer from serious health problems. One man is living with bolts in his knees, while another suffers from corollary heart disease. Some fear conditions in Greece will make their conditions worse.
Aria Ntanika of Doctors Without Borders told Al Jazeera reports of refugees harming themselves in order to leave the camp were ""horrendous"" and ""unacceptable"".
She said EU policies are ""pushing people to complete and utter despair"".

Within moments, the men were pounding a fellow passenger with a club. When the Greek lawyer attempted to intervene and yell at the assailants, one punched her in the face several times.
She had been confronted by members of the neo-fascist party twice before, but on this occasion was sent into a state of shock as she was beaten.
Nearby, the party was on trial over allegations of being a criminal organisation.
The group had been passing out flyers to commemorate the deaths of two party members, who were allegedly killed by anti-fascists in 2013.
""I'm sure that I was attacked because I told them to stop … and I'm sure the fascist members of Golden Dawn recognised me from the court,"" said Kouniaki, who is part of a legal team for a group of Egyptian fishermen attacked by a Golden Dawn squad in Perama, an area near Athens, in 2012.
Sitting in her office in Exarchia, a central Athens neighbourhood, Kouniaki recalled the attack.
""I saw they were trying to enter the [bus] to find a man … after a while, they started to enter, and I started to yell 'stop, stop',"" she told Al Jazeera.
Although Kouniaki was puzzled by the attack - she did not hear the man provoke the far-rightists and he did not subsequently speak out in the media - she has since concluded that they ""wanted to send a message"".
After the incident ended, the men walked off, passing the police without being stopped.
Kouniaki recognised her attackers as members of Golden Dawn's Piraeus branch; she has since filed a complaint.
By the time of publication, the Greek police had not replied to Al Jazeera's request for a comment.
In a statement published the following day, Golden Dawn leader Nikolaos Michaloliakos said he ""strongly condemn[s] every act of violence"" without referencing the attack on Kouniaki.
It was the latest in a string of similar attacks in Greece, which have sparked fears of a resurgence in far-right violence.
Golden Dawn currently has 16 seats in the Hellenic Parliament and three in the European Parliament. While it is not the only far-right group, it has a reputation for carrying out vigilante attacks.
On November 26, a group of Greek football fans attacked Pakistani immigrants as they celebrated the birth of Prophet Muhammad in central Athens' Omonia Square. Police fired tear gas and sound grenades to disperse the crowd.
Earlier this month, a far-right group targeted the house of Amir, an 11-year-old Afghan boy who had been blocked from carrying a Greek flag during a school parade in October.
A neo-Nazi vigilante organisation calling itself Crypteia, a reference to a group of ancient Spartans infamous for attacking slaves, claimed responsibility for the attack on the boy's home.
Crypteia is believed to be a splinter group that broke away from the Golden Dawn, which has toned down its street-level violence in recent years owing to the ongoing trial of 69 of its members accused of operating a criminal organisation.
After smashing windows and throwing rocks and beer bottles at the home, they left behind a note that read: ""Go back to your village. Leave.""
Last month, a group of men surrounded and attacked a pair of Pakistani migrant labourers in a field in Aspropyrgos, an industrial area near the Greek capital of Athens.
Vakas Hussein and Ashfak Mahmoud, the victims of that attack, were subsequently hospitalised for stab wounds and injuries sustained from blows with iron rods to their heads and bodies.
Speaking to Greek media, Mahmoud later recalled his attackers shouting racist taunts and threatening to set them ablaze. Speaking to Greece's 24/7 News at the time, he said: ""They said they would burn me alive.""
In March, a gang of Golden Dawn members brutally beat Alexis Lazaras, a 24-year-old university student, near the party headquarters in an Athens suburb.
The attack is suspected to be retribution for an anti-fascist action that saw masked anarchists smash the windows of the party's main headquarters earlier that day, though there has been no indication that Lazaras had any connection to that incident.
On November 8, a criminal court in Athens delivered a guilty verdict to Golden Dawn member Christos Zervos for causing serious bodily injury over the attack on Lazaras. His sentence was suspended pending appeal.
Far-right attacks on refugees and migrants on Greek islands, such as Chios and Samos, have also become part and parcel of life for asylum seekers since the mass influx of refugees to Europe started in 2015.
Seraphim Seferiades, a politics professor at the Panteion University in Athens, explained that the recent uptick should raise red flags.
He argued that the government, currently led by the leftist Syriza party, has failed to provide an alternative to growing xenophobia and disillusionment with the status quo.
""As long as there is no alternative from the left, I wouldn't be surprised if the Golden Dawn sought to fill the void. We've been seeing it all over Europe,"" he said.
Syriza came to power in January 2015 after campaigning on a left-wing programme, but it has drawn criticism for reneging on promises to end austerity and to support refugees and migrants uprooted by war and economic devastation.
Seferiades said Syriza's about-face ""has created a gap, and any demagogue who comes along and is backed up by considerable resources could fill that role"".
Thanasis Kampagiannis, a lawyer in the Golden Dawn trial, has monitored the far-right organisation and others like it for years. ""Golden Dawn is a neo-Nazi organisation, and it models itself off Hitler's battalions,"" he told Al Jazeera.
In October 2012, the United Nations refugee agency said that 87 racist attacks had been recorded between January and September of that year. Often wearing Golden Dawn insignia, the attackers targeted refugees and undocumented migrants from Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Pakistan and elsewhere.
Yet, the party was put on trial after one of its members killed anti-fascist rapper Pavlos Fyssas in September 2013. Since then, the number of racist and far-right attacks in Greece has sharply decreased.
""The number of attacks decreasing is beyond doubt… and this shows that the racist attacks we experienced in 2012 and 2013 were organised by Golden Dawn,"" he argued.
""But this doesn't mean we don't still have fascist attacks, and this mainly has to do with the fact that Golden Dawn is not capable of reform. It cannot stop [carrying out attacks], even if it needs to decrease its violence.""
Evgenia Kouniaki, a Greek lawyer attacked by Golden Dawn members
Back in her office, Kouniaki said she expected violence from Golden Dawn but was nonetheless stunned by the attack.
""I was shocked because the reality is that I didn't believe it could happen outside of the court where they are on trial,"" she said.
She was first threatened by Golden Dawn supporters in 2010 in Agios Panteleimonas, an area in Athens. After she arrived in the neighbourhood to find a group of Afghan refugees sitting bloodied on the road after being attacked, a throng of party supporters hurled threats in her direction.
Two years later, while making her way home after a political rally, she encountered a group of men she suspects were Golden Dawn members beating a Bangladeshi immigrant at a metro station. When she tried to intervene, they dragged her off and threw her to the pavement.
For her part, Kouniaki said she will not be deterred by violence or threats.
""This is what Golden Dawn wants in society: People to fear expressing their ideas and to not stand with immigrants and refugees … But it is a political duty.""

Thursday's announcement came after revelations that African asylum seekers and migrants were being sold into slavery in Libya as they tried in vain to reach European shores.
""This disgraceful drama reminds us of the darkest hours of humanity. I call on our collective sense of responsibility to take urgent action,"" Alassane Ouattara, president of Ivory Coast, said at a two-day African-European Union summit in Abidjan.
The summit, which was meant to focus on development in African countries, instead focused largely on the Mediterranean refugee crisis.
French President Emmanuel Macron said leaders were focused on fixing ""a series of very critical issues and atrocities, like in Libya"".
The African Union, European Union and UN announced the creation of a task force to deal with the migration crisis, notably in Libya.
The body will work in close collaboration with the Libyan government, the groups said in a statement.
The goal is ""to save and protect lives of migrants and refugees along the routes and in particular inside Libya, accelerating the assisted voluntary returns to countries of origin, and the resettlement of those in need of international protection"".
It will also aim to dismantle criminal networks involved in trafficking.
However, Antonio Guterres, the UN secretary-general, said it was important to address the root causes of the crisis if it was to be resolved.
""We will not put an end to the tragedy in the Mediterranean if we do not create significant, legal migration opportunities. We must also ensure that people can find a dignified future in their home country,"" he said during the meeting.
Others said more must be done to give young Africans opportunities at home.
""We have to invest in jobs,"" said Oxfam's Magalie Laliberte.
""We have to invest to cover their basic needs, that's what we need to do.""
Al Jazeera's Natacha Butler, reporting from Abidjan, said the slave trade in Libya has shocked and embarrassed leaders in both Africa and Europe.
""It has injected a sense of urgency to this summit. International leaders, including Guterres and representatives of charitable organisations, said that African nations must create legal pathways for migration and invest funds in economic development,"" she said.
These actors say ""more must be done to stop Africans leaving home in the first place"".

The sound of these women reciting English phrases, laughing and the occasional cries of kids can be heard in the stairwell.
Its founder, Sharifah Husain, 24, said she wanted to do something to help women and children in her community, who are not allowed to work or study in Malaysia.
""I noticed we didn't have a Rohingya women's organisation that was standing up for women - to be the voice of women,"" Husain said.
Husain comes from Buthidaung village in Myanmar's restive Rakhine state. Her father fled to Malaysia when she was 5 years old, fearing for his life. Husain was left behind with her mother and two younger siblings.
The village was attacked soon after, so Husain's mother took them to Yangon, the former capital of Myanmar - then known as Burma.
Her recollection of the traumatic moment when a local mob attacked her village is hazy. It took place almost 20 years ago.
Rohingya refugees: 'I do not hope to return'
But it mirrors the accounts of Rohingya refugees now in Bangladesh, who've recently fled the Myanmar's army clearance operations and local Buddhist mobs.
""My mother was arrested in Yangon and sentenced to prison for not having official [identification or travel] documents,"" Husain recounted. ""This left me in charge.""
Husain can't remember how long she spent in Yangon, but she said she was separated from her siblings and sent north to Mandalay and forced into servitude.
She spoke to her father in Malaysia, over the phone, and he agreed to pay human traffickers to bring Husain and her siblings to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia's largest city. All three, including Husain, were smuggled by land, into Thailand and Malaysia.
At that time the Southeast Asia trafficking route wasn't as defined as it is today. Human trafficking groups in Bangladesh and Thailand now make a lot of money off of poor, desperate refugees fleeing war and violence in Myanmar.
Today, the concern faced by the Malaysia government is if it recognises its refugees then that could send a signal to make the perilous journey, now taken by sea from Myanmar and Bangladesh, to sanctuary in Malaysia, where they don't face violent persecution.
The UN refugee agency, UNHCR, states there are 152,170 registered refugees in Malaysia. The majority are Rohingya, displaced from their homes in Myanmar, like Husain.
But the amount of unregistered refugees varies widely from 40,000 to 140,000, according to Asylum Access Malaysia.
""The big question is - when are the boats going to come? There's no indication they will now, but there's definitely a high possibility that they will. And once new groups arrive, that complicates [the] situation,"" said Deepa Nambiar, Asylum Access Malaysia director.
UNHCR runs what it calls a ""parallel school system"" for refugees in Malaysia, allowing children to access basic, primary-level education.
Refugee groups and local faith-based organisations fund these schools, staffed by volunteers. One-hundred and twenty-eight informal refugee schools in Malaysia access funding from the UN. It provides education to 7,154 children, according to UNHCR.
Malaysia's Prime Minister's Office states 16,809 Rohingya refugee children are registered with UNHCR. This means about 10,000, or more, refugee children in Malaysia are unable to access any form of education.
A dozen or so more informal refugee schools exist but rely solely on donations and are understaffed, said Asylum Access.
""To live in Malaysia, yes you can live, but you don't have a future. You are in a box. You can't go out of the box,"" Husain said.
UN says 14,000 Rohingya children may die from malnutrition
Husain has received no formal education in Malaysia. This is remarkable considering her drive to educate refugee women and children. Malaysians are supporting Rohingya Women's Development Network by volunteering as teachers and support staff.
Rohingya Women's Development Network started officially last year. But Husain has spent the last decade educating her community's most vulnerable women and children in their own homes.
""I have built up a trust. The men especially trust me. They feel safe sending their wives to our centre because they know me,"" Husain said.
Word has spread and more refugee families are now attending Rohingya Women's Development Network classes, where they receive English-language instruction, leadership training and brand new self-defence classes.
""We want to stop domestic violence. We want to stop child marriages in the community. We want to build up women's empowerment,"" Husain said. ""We really need the Malaysia government to recognise us.""
Husain is trying to change the mentality in the Rohingya and wider refugee community in Malaysia, that women and girls can't study, work, or earn an income. She receives some funding from UNHCR to run programmes but uses her own money to keep them going.
""Of course I have support from my family. My father is my hero. My husband is my hero. Both of these men have really pushed me forward,"" Husain added.
The Rohingya Women's Development Network has teamed up with Asylum Access Malaysia on a refugee theatre project. This will allow refugee women to educate the community on issues of sexual violence.
""What I think is so innovative about Sharifah and the team is that when we were discussing this project they said 'we need to get men involved',"" Nambiar said.
Pope meets Suu Kyi, fails to mention Rohingya in speech
Husain is appealing to others in the refugee community to support initiatives set up by the Malaysia government and civil society groups to help Rohingya women and children displaced in Bangladesh's refugee camps.
Malaysia is setting up a new 50-bed field hospital for refugees in Bangladesh. The European Rohingya Council (ERC) runs two camp clinics.
ERC's Malaysia Ambassador Tengku Emma Zuriana works closely with the Rohingya Women's Development Network, helping refugee women in Malaysia and Bangladesh.
""I am trying to build an orphanage in Bangladesh to protect the children exposed to child trafficking,"" Zuriana said. ""We are trying to fundraise to build a proper orphanage with a school inside. They will be protected and receive education.""
To raise awareness of the plight of Rohingya women and children fleeing the atrocities in Myanmar to Bangladesh, the Rohingya Women's Development Network is selling beaded jewellery made during class.
Despite the Malaysian government's commitment to provide vital aid and healthcare to Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh, some in Malaysia say they're also desperate and in need.
Malaysia: A Rohingya safe haven?
To improve the situation, Malaysia has launched a pilot project giving jobs to selected refugees. This, refugees hope, will pave the pathway to citizenship in Malaysia.
""It's no different. In Myanmar they have been suffering. When they are outside of Myanmar, they come to Malaysia and expect something better. Things are not getting better,"" Husain said. ""They just escape death. But they're still suffering here because they don't have any rights.""
Asylum Access Malaysia's director Deepa Nambiar said Rohingya refugees in Malaysia do receive a lot of sympathy, but not enough is done to help them integrate or assimilate.
""If we can be in a place where Rohingya women are educated, aware of their options, empowered to speak out, engage with NGOs [non-governmental organisations] and partners [and] the government,"" Nambiar said. ""We have the right environment to do it in Malaysia.""
Husain said she believes the true function of Rohingya Women's Development Network is to educate the community on its history - where it comes from and why it has been displaced all over Southeast Asia, and the world.
""We cannot destroy our [own] identity. If we do that, it's very easy for Myanmar to say 'they are really Bengali,' I'm not Bengali!"" Husain exclaimed.
""The younger generation needs to know who we are so we can fight for our rights.""

Andreas Hollstein, 57, was struck in the neck while in a kebab shop.
Witnesses said the attacker criticised the mayor's pro-refugee policy during the stabbing. The attack was stopped by Demir Abdullah, the shop owner, and his son.
Hollstein was lightly injured on his neck after the assailant put a large knife on his throat.
""You let me die of thirst but you bring 200 refugees to Altena,"" the attacker said, according to Hollstein.
""I was lucky the shop owners helped me,"" he said during a press conference.
""They risked their own lives by doing so. I'm sure that if they hadn't reacted like that, I wouldn't be alive.""
The attacker is being prosecuted for attempted murder.
Altena, a city with about 17,000 inhabitants, has been very welcoming to refugees coming to Germany, taking in more refugees than the quota set and using the slogan: ""From refugee to fellow citizen"" as a way to promote its open policy.
Hollstein, member of Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservative CDU party, has been part of the driving force behind this pro-refugee stance.
In May, he received an award from Merkel for his part in integrating refugees into German society.
On Twitter, Merkel condemned the attack, saying she was appalled by the event. ""I'm very relieved he can be with his family again. Thank you to those who have helped him.""
Kanzlerin #Merkel: „Ich bin entsetzt über den Messerangriff auf Bürgermeister Andreas Hollstein - und sehr erleichtert, dass er schon wieder bei seiner Familie sein kann. Dank auch an die, die ihm geholfen haben."" #Altena
During the press conference, Hollstein cautioned against hate in the political discourse, saying: ""Hate doesn't get us anywhere. Getting this message across is important to me.""
He said he felt the social climate had hardened but that these risks had to be taken into consideration.
However, Hollstein said police protection was out of the question. ""I can't do my job with police protection,"" he said.
His sentiment was echoed by Germany's justice minister, Heiko Maas. He said on Twitter that attacks on others, especially when they are helping people, should never be accepted.
""Our country should not tolerate hate and violence,"" Hollstein added.
Schreckliche Nachricht aus Altena. Gute Besserung, BM Andreas Hollstein @Hollstein63. Dürfen niemals akzeptieren, dass Menschen attackiert werden, nur weil sie anderen helfen. In unserem Land darf kein Platz sein für Hass und Gewalt. https://t.co/8GBqqEEjJe
The CDU has drawn a lot of criticism over the last couple of years for its open stance regarding refugees.
It won last September's elections, but saw far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party gain many seats in parliament.
The AfD is known for its strong anti-refugee stance.
In 2015, Cologne's mayor, Henriette Reker, was stabbed in a similar incident. She was severely injured, but survived. Last year, her attacker was sentenced to 14 years in jail.

After months of stalemate, the talks are expected to focus primarily on a new constitution and elections, two of the four so-called ""baskets"" of reforms laid out by the United Nations for a political settlement to the Syria crisis.
The UN's special envoy for Syria, Staffan de Mistura, said he hoped the warring factions would start a fresh round of negotiations ""without preconditions"" and within the framework of the UN Security Council's resolutions.
""We are all moving, I hope, in the direction of implementing Resolution 2254 and a political solution long overdue in Syria,"" said De Mistura from Moscow on Friday, at the end of a frantic week spent between the Saudi and Russian capitals in a bid to ensure that both the government and the opposition would come to Geneva ready to lay the groundwork for a political solution.
De Mistura announced earlier that he would press hard for ""particular up-front attention on a new constitution and UN-supervised elections"", two of the four baskets, which also include a non-sectarian transitional government and ""counterterrorism"" measures.
Discussions will also address the issue of detainees, abductees and missing persons, De Mistura said, along with the need for full humanitarian access in any besieged or hard-to-reach-areas, including Eastern Ghouta.
De Mistura said a follow-up round of talks would likely take place in December.
Some 50 delegates representing different factions within the Syrian opposition arrived in the Swiss city of Geneva over the weekend in preparation for the talks.
The unity of the opposition front will be put to the test on Tuesday. Disagreement over the future role of President Bashar al-Assad in a transitional government has considerably weakened the opposition's capability to negotiate a favourable way out of the crisis over the past few months.
Statements issued by the opposition after a two-day meeting in Riyadh last week did not clarify how this critical issue would play out.
According to a statement issued by the Riyadh conference on Friday, ""the participants stressed that the transition cannot happen without the departure of Bashar al-Assad and his circle at the start of the interim period"". Hours later, however, Nasr Hariri, the new chief negotiator for the High Negotiations Committee (HNC), Syria's main opposition group, told reporters that the opposition was ready to discuss ""everything on the negotiating table"" without preconditions.
Early last week, Hariri replaced Riyad Hijab, a former Syrian prime minister, who led the HNC for almost two years. Hijab, a hardliner, hinted in a statement that the HNC had faced pressure to make concessions in favour of Assad. His departure led to speculation that the group may soften its stance towards the Syrian president and his role in the transitional period.
Significantly, Hijab's resignation came as Assad made a televised appearance next to Russian President Vladimir Putin in Sochi, where the Russian leader, a staunch supporter of Assad, held a meeting with his Iranian and Turkish counterparts to discuss the Syria crisis.
""It is important to reach a political settlement now, and Assad is ready to work with anyone who wants peace,"" said the Russian president, who later announced he would convene a Syria Congress at the beginning of December in Sochi.
Appearing strong in the wake of the successful fight against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant group (ISIL, also known as ISIS) and major territorial gains after two years of Russian and Iranian military interventions that reversed the conquests of the opposition, Assad now has the upper hand in the negotiations.
Analysts were sceptical that the Geneva talks would make any progress towards a political settlement.
""There will not be a formal Geneva-style diplomatic settlement, whether under UN auspices or other,"" said Yezid Sayigh, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Middle East Center in Beirut. According to Sayigh, the Russia-backed Astana talks, a parallel track to the UN-sponsored peace process, aim to reintegrate the Syrian opposition under the current state system.
Marwan Kabalan, an analyst with the Doha Institute, noted that the fate of Assad would long remain a contentious issue: ""A significant part of the country in the north and south, holding most of the oil and water reserves, is not under the control of the regime. This means the conflict will last much, much longer than people expect.""
The final communique from the opposition in Riyadh focused primarily on rejecting Iran's interference in Syria. Saudi Arabia has thrown its weight behind a number of opposition groups and has pushed for the removal of Assad in a bid to contain Iran's growing hegemony in the region.
But the Sochi meeting was emblematic of a new geopolitical reality, wherein Assad and his allies will continue to play a dominant role in Syria and the rest of the region.
Syria's civil war, now in its seventh year, has killed hundreds of thousands of people and created the world's worst refugee crisis, driving more than 11 million people from their homes.
In its 2018 Humanitarian Needs Overview on Syria, published last week, the UN said that the scale and severity of needs across Syria remain overwhelming. Some 13 million people require humanitarian assistance, including 5.6 million in acute need due to limited access to basic goods and services.
Of the 5.5 million Syrian refugees worldwide, most of whom remain in neighbouring countries, a very limited number have returned to Syria. In 2017, around 720,000 people returned to their areas of origin.

At the meeting in Yangon on Tuesday, the pontiff stressed the importance of Myanmar respecting the ""identity"" of all of its ethnic groups, without using the term ""Rohingya"".
More than 600,000 Rohingya have fled to neighbouring Bangladesh in fear of abuses by Myanmarese soldiers.
The ethnic group is subject to a raft of discriminatory measures by Myanmar's government, such as being deprived of citizenship.
Having previously spoken against the ""persecution of our Rohingya brothers and sisters,"" the leader of the Roman Catholic Church had been advised by Myanmar's archbishop not to use the word Rohingya.
Tun Khin, the president of the Burmese Rohingya Organisation UK (BROUK), told Al Jazeera that the pope's omission of the word ""Rohingya"" was ""very sad"".
""The Burmese government is denying our existence, and our identity,"" he said. ""How can the pope raise the issue of the Rohingya crisis if he is not even using the name?""
Khin said that the pope should use his platform to pressure Aung San Suu Kyi and Myanmar's military to ""stop this genocide"" and to allow humanitarian aid access to the Rohingya.
""He should have spoken out against this hate campaign targeting the Rohingya and other minorities in Burma,"" Khin said.
Nevertheless, Al Jazeera's Scott Heidler, reporting from Yangon, said the pontiff did allude to the persecuted minority.
""Rohingya is a very sensitive topic, it is a very sensitive word here in Myanmar, particularly when it comes to dealing with the government,"" Heidler explained.
""He didn't say Rohingya but he alluded to the Rohingya and their plight, and he said that for the future of this country there needs to be acceptance and respect for the identity of all ethnic groups and who they are.""
The International Rescue Committee expressed hope that the pope will address a number of key aspects regarding the Rohingya crisis.
“We are talking about a global figure of unity and compassion and hope for the world’s most vulnerable people,” Chiara Trincia, an IRC humanitarian expert told Al Jazeera.
Among these key aspects, Trincia said, is first and foremost the call for Myanmarese authorities to halt all military operations, and to emphasize that the crux of this crisis rests upon a recognition of and improvement in the basic and equal rights, services and protections long denied to the Rohingya people.
Myanmar's ruling party has objected to the use of the term Rohingya to identify the mostly Muslim minority, demanding that they are called ""Bengalis"" despite the persecuted group living there for generations.
The UN, as well as the US, have said the violent actions taken by Myanmar's armed forces and ""local vigilantes"" amount to ""ethnic cleansing"" against its Rohingya minority.
In 2012, Myanmar's armed forces began to force Rohingya into refugee camps, both in Rakhine state and across the border into Bangladesh.
The ongoing crisis is being described as the world's biggest forced exodus this year.
Last week the government of Bangladesh signed a deal with Myanmar on the repatriation of Rohingya, but details of the deal have still not been made public.

His trip comes as the Myanmar government is accused of ""ethnically cleansing"" its Rohingya Muslim minority, more than 600,000 of whom have taken shelter in neighbouring Bangladesh.
The 80-year-old leader of Roman Catholic Church who has spoken against ""persecution of our Rohingya brothers and sisters"" in the past has been advised not use the word Rohingya.
On his first day in Myanmar, Francis met general Min Aung Hlaing, a senior army commander who is in part behind the persecution of the Rohingya's in Myanmar.
In a post on his Facebook page, Hlaing wrote that he told the Pope that there was no religious discrimination in the country.
Neither Francis nor general Hliang clarified if the Rohingya issue was discussed.
Ro Mayyu Ali, a Rohingya Muslim who fled to neighbouring Bangladesh in September, said he hoped the pope would use his visit to speak up for the persecuted minority.
""I will never forget the moment you stopped your white popemobile and kissed the separation wall, a barrier between Palestine and Israel, during your visit to Bethlehem in 2014. It was a massive political statement,"" Ali told Al Jazeera.
""I hope you use this opportunity to use speak up for some of the 620,000 Rohingya who have fled to Bangladesh and witnessed gang rape, mass killing, and seen their children burned alive.""
Francis has previously condemned the atrocities, including mass killings and gang rapes, committed against the Muslim minority. He is also expected to meet with refugees in the coming days.
""Rohingya is a very sensitive topic, it is a very sensitive word here in Myanmar, particularly when it comes to dealing with the government,"" said Al Jazeera's Scott Heidler, reporting from outside the archbishop's house in the country's largest city of Yangon.
""The archbishop himself has advised the pope not to use that term here because it is something the government doesn't recognise,"" Heidler added.
According to the United Nations, security forces in Myanmar reportedly burned down entire villages and opened fire at people fleeing burning homes.
Myanmar's ruling party has objected to the use of the term ""Rohingya"" to identify the mostly Muslim minority, demanding that they be called ""Bengalis"" despite the persecuted group living there for generations.
""But what a lot of people are saying here…what they really want is for him [Francis] to focus on peace in this nation,"" the Al Jazeera correspondent said.
""Obviously, the international community expects him to focus on the Rohingya issue because that is a crisis viewed by the world…as ethnic cleansing,"" he said.
Besides senior general Hliang, the pontiff is also expected to meet Myanmar's de facto leader Aung San Suu Kyi, who has blamed the Rohingya for the crisis.
The UN, as well as the United States, have said the violent actions taken by Myanmar's armed forces and ""local vigilantes"" amount to ""ethnic cleansing"" against its Rohingya minority.

The news slowly made its way throughout the labyrinthine alleyways of tarpaulin and bamboo shelters that more than 800,000 stateless Rohingya now call home. For those living in the camps, the development was frustratingly light on details, but the first repatriations could start in two months.
More than 620,000 Rohingya, a minority Muslim group, have fled Myanmar's Rakhine State since August 25 amid allegations of murder, mass rape, and coordinated arson carried out by the Myanmar military, in what the United States and United Nations have called ""ethnic cleansing"". The violence came after attacks on Myanmar police stations by the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army.
A 1982 law prohibits Rohingya from becoming citizens of Myanmar. For decades, smaller groups of Rohingya have fled to Bangladesh to escape persecution from the majority Buddhist population in Myanmar. The most recent repatriation agreement was in 1992.
Rights groups have called for international monitors to oversee the latest repatriation, noting that Rohingya must be promised safety, the right to return to their land, equal rights and citizenship. Amnesty International has called the deal premature, as thousands of Rohingya continue to flee to Bangladesh every week.
Al Jazeera spoke with Rohingya refugees at the Kutupalong Refugee Camp about the prospects of returning to Myanmar.
The military started firing at us as we were fleeing our village when they started the attacks [in August]. My son was killed and two of my daughters were taken away by the military. I have five other children who made it to Bangladesh … I am educated. When I was younger, it was better for us. I was educated by a Muslim government teacher.
But education is not so easy for Rohingya any more. I did not get a job, despite being educated, because I was Rohingya. Rather, other non-Rohingya got the job, even though I was better educated.
I heard the news about the repatriation agreement from the radio. We don't want the 1992 agreement. We want that no violence will happen to us, that people will get an education, that people will freely move and not have to bribe the military to get around. If we do not get more rights, I will die here in Bangladesh.
I came to the camps in the beginning of October. Our mosques and madrasas were closed by the government in 2012. The government has been pressuring us, and the situation got gradually more difficult. Our clerics were jailed.
If a Rohingya is well educated, he cannot get any job like Rakhine people. We cannot live freely. I'm extremely eager to go back to my homeland, but the first and main thing we need is citizenship. If we are not given citizenship, I would die rather than go back.
After the repatriation in 1992, Rohingya continued to be repressed. They would say, ""Why are you here? You are Bengali."" We're afraid this repatriation agreement will be the same as in 1992. We want a different agreement. In the 1992 agreement, you needed to show Myanmar identity papers to return. Most people don't have Myanmar identification cards. I have one and my grandfather has one, but my father does not. Families will be separated.
I will also only go back if we can return to our land. We really miss our land in Myanmar; it is too crowded here in the camps. We are in hardship here. We don't have fuel to cook food. First, we want citizenship status; that is our main demand. We want all people to be treated equally.
I will never go back to Myanmar as things are now. The Myanmar government disregarded our dignity. Women were raped and oppressed by them. The military surrounded our village and began firing on us. We ran. My aunt's child and husband were killed.
We tried to hide in the woods. I was raped by the military. I was beaten, hit in the head and shoulders and legs. I never experienced peace in Myanmar. There, we could not sleep. Here, at least we can sleep and know we are safe.
Even if the Myanmar government says we are safe, I won't go. They say one thing and do another. I will only go if we are given citizenship status and the government promises us protection. They need to settle this in a just way. Otherwise, I will not go back to Myanmar, even if they have to kill me here in Bangladesh.
I came to Bangladesh in 2007. When I left Myanmar, there wasn't any violence, but we had no rights. I had to bribe the government just to do business and move around where I wanted to.
We want to go back to our homeland, our farms, our cattle and our shelters. We miss these things. But we are trying to get more rights from Myanmar. If they don't give us citizenship, why would we want to go back there? The people are not free to work, do any kind of ritual, choose any kind of profession. It is hard for children to get an education and we cannot freely move.
I will return if the situation improves, and our kids can get an education, and our land is returned, so we can live like the other people in Rakhine. We want equality.
My daughter was thrown into the fire of a burning house by the Myanmar military. The military killed her. She was three and a half years old. I have no other children.
I will not return now because we have been oppressed and I remember that oppression. I do not hope to return.
We should have citizenship status and the military must assure the international community that they will not oppress us. But I don't believe we will be safe. I don't believe the military will change anytime soon. The Myanmar government must promise us stability, and the world must force them to obey.

Myanmar's Rakhine state is the ancestral home for Muslim-majority Rohingya, but those living there face discrimination, violence, and segregation. Human rights group Amnesty International calls it a ""system of apartheid"".
The repatriation deal does not take Rohingya refugees' rights into consideration, said the European Rohingya Council (ERC). Its Malaysia ambassador, Tengku Emma Zuriana, has spoken out against it.
""This repatriation process should not proceed until the safety of the Rohingya [can be] ensured,"" she said.
Malaysia is home to about 150,000 Rohingya. Several non-government organisations held a press conference here on Thursday to discuss the repatriation plan.
The United Nations and United States have stated the violent actions taken by Myanmar's armed forces and ""local vigilantes"" amount to ethnic cleansing against its Rohingya minority.
""This must be a voluntary process, in safety and dignity, and for them to return to their homes - not into camps. And if there's any loss of property and life, it must be compensated fairly,"" Zuriana said.
Malaysian civil society groups and faith-based organisations urged the Myanmar government to end the violence, and to ensure the safety of the Rohingya living in Rakhine state before any repatriation process begins.
The Malaysia Consultative Council of Islamic Organisation (MAPIM) said any repatriation deal must include protection and compensation for Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh who've lost everything amid the heavy-handed ""security clearance"" operation.
""Even if the agreement has been finalised, we strongly call on the UN to ensure safe passage for the Rohingya to return back to their homes,"" said MAPIM President Mohd Azmi Abdul Hamid.
He went on to ask the international community and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN): ""What repatriation are they planning to implement when the Rohingya's' lives are totally destroyed?""
Myanmar Ethnic Rohingya Human Rights Organization Malaysia (MERHROM) wanted to remind Bangladesh of past Rohingya repatriations to Myanmar.
""[An] estimated 240,000 Rohingya were repatriated by the Bangladesh government under the 1978 agreement, which had a six month time limit. After that, Bangladesh repatriated about 236,000 Rohingya until 2005 under the 1992 agreement,"" noted MERHROM President Zafar Ahmad.
In 2012, Myanmar's armed forces began to force Rohingya into refugee camps, both in Rakhine state and across the border into Bangladesh.
Recent attacks on a police outpost in Rakhine state by the armed group Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA) sparked the latest army crackdown. More than 600,000 Rohingya fled their homes into Bangladesh's refugee camps.
MERHROM wants the UN Security Council to conduct an assessment of the situation in Rakhine state, to ensure military operations against Rohingya have ceased.
Myanmar Armed Forces Senior General Min Aung Hlaing has said the Rohingya could return only if they are ""real citizens"".
The UN said on Friday the time wasn't right for a Rohingya return.
""At present, conditions in Myanmar's Rakhine state are not in place to enable safe and sustainable returns. Refugees are still fleeing, and many have suffered violence, rape, and deep psychological harm,"" said Adrian Edwards, a spokesperson for the office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
""It is critical that returns do not take place precipitously or prematurely, without the informed consent of refugees or the basic elements of lasting solutions in place,"" he added.
Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh and Malaysia agree they must be consulted.
""Until the Myanmar government is serious to improve the situation, the Bangladesh government should not agree to any repatriation plan,"" Zuriana said.
""The European Rohingya Council is calling [on] Myanmar authorities to grant full citizenship to the Rohingya and review the [1982] citizenship law.""
ERC called on the international community to send a clear message to Myanmar that it will not tolerate any further violence. It also said it wants to see the UN observe, support, and monitor all investigations into human rights violations.
Humanitarian agencies providing aid and medical services to the Rohingya in Rakhine state are not allowed to access secured areas, where those most affected need urgent help.
Until unhindered access is granted to aid agencies in Rakhine by the Myanmar government, refugee and civil society groups in Malaysia will continue to voice opposition to any agreement, they said.
The concern is Myanmar will force returning Rohingya into displacement camps and settlement zones protected by the same armed forces guilty of carrying out attacks them.
""They don't have the freedom to go back home,"" Zuriana said.

In an interview with The New Times, Louise Mushikiwabo said the two countries have yet to reach an agreement on how many asylum seekers currently in Israel could eventually be resettled in Rwanda.
""We have had discussions with Israel on receiving some of the immigrants and asylum seekers from this part of Africa who would be willing to come to Rwanda,"" Mushikiwabo told the newspaper.
""If they are comfortable to come here, we would be willing to accommodate them. How it's done and their livelihoods, once they are here, are details that have not been concluded yet,"" she said.
Mushikiwabo did not say when a possible transfer would take place.
The minister's comments come less than a week after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced his government would seek to remove 40,000 asylum seekers from the country ""without their consent"".
""This is very important,"" Netanyahu said in a statement on Sunday, the same day the Israeli cabinet voted to close a detention centre in the country's southern Negev desert that currently houses just over 1,000 asylum seekers.
Israel is currently home to about 40,000 asylum seekers, according to government figures. That includes 27,500 Eritrean and 7,800 Sudanese asylum seekers, the UN refugee agency (UNHCR) has reported.
Israeli officials have said they intend to shutter the Holot detention centre within the next four months and give remaining African asylum seekers two options: indefinite detention in Israel, or deportation to a third-country, with or without their consent.
According to Israeli daily Haaretz, Israel will pay Rwanda up to $5,000 for each asylum seeker it agrees to take in.
It will also pay each asylum seeker $3,500 to leave Israel and buy their flights out of the country, the newspaper reported.
The United Nations has raised concerns about potential deals to deport asylum seekers to a third country such as Rwanda, however.
""As party to the 1951 Refugee Convention, Israel has legal obligations to protect refugees and other persons in need of international protection,"" Volker Turk, UNHCR's assistant high commissioner for protection, said in a recent statement.

Myanmar's foreign ministry confirmed the signing of the agreement on Thursday, without releasing further details.
""I didn't find any clear statement how these refugees will be repatriated. I'm not sure whether they will be allowed to return to their original village,"" Rohingya activist Nay San Lwin told Al Jazeera.
""It looks like they will be placed in the temporary camps, and later the refugees will be locked up in the camps for a long time like the Rohingya in Sittwe for more than five years now.
""Myanmar minister for resettlement and welfare said they will repatriate maximum 300 refugees a day. So it can take up to two decades to repatriate all those refugees.""
Al Jazeera's Scott Heidler, reporting from Yangon, said the deal was the result of international pressure which has been mounting steadily on Myanmar.
""For Myanmar, it's very important because it is showing some progress on this Rohingya crisis,"" Heidler said.
San Lwin said refugees should not return if their citizenship and basic rights are not guaranteed.
Rohingya activist Nay San Lwin
""Bangladesh should not send back any Rohingya refugee to Myanmar unless citizenship and basic rights are guaranteed. The people who fled to Bangladesh lived in the open air prison for almost three decades, now it looks like they will be sent back to concentration camps.""
The agreement comes after Myanmar's de facto leader Aung San Suu Kyi met Bangladesh's foreign minister to resolve one of the biggest refugee crisis of modern times.
More than 620,000 people have poured into Bangladesh since August, running from a Myanmar military crackdown that the US said this week clearly constitutes ""ethnic cleansing against the Rohingya"".
The talks between Aung San Suu Kyi and her Bangladeshi counterpart come in advance of a highly anticipated visit to both nations by Pope Francis, who has been outspoken about his sympathy for the plight of the Rohingya.
Buddhist-majority Myanmar, which denies committing atrocities against the Muslim minority, has agreed to work with Bangladesh to repatriate some of the Rohingya piling into desperately overstretched refugee camps.
But the neighbours have struggled to settle on the details, including how many Rohingya will be allowed back in violence-scorched Rakhine, where hundreds of villages have been burned.
Last week Myanmar's military chief Min Aung Hlaing said it was ""impossible to accept the number of persons proposed by Bangladesh"".
Rendered stateless, Rohingya have been the target of communal violence and vicious anti-Muslim sentiment for years. They have also been systematically oppressed by the government, which stripped the minority of citizenship and severely restricts their movement, as well as their access to basic services. The latest crisis erupted after Rohingya rebels attacked police posts on August 25. The army backlash rained violence across northern Rakhine, with refugees recounting nightmarish scenes of soldiers and Buddhist mobs slaughtering villagers and burning down entire communities. The military denies all allegations but has restricted access to the conflict zone. Aung San Suu Kyi's government has also vowed to deny visas to a UN-fact finding mission tasked with probing accusations of military abuse.

But this is no ordinary television news station. It's fully staffed by Rohingya refugees broadcasting online, sharing news and information from Myanmar, Bangladesh and beyond. It's essentially refugee TV, brought to you from studios in Malaysia, Pakistan, and Saudi Arabia.
Sitting at the news anchor desk is Arifa Sultana, a 23-year-old Rohingya journalist. Her family fled from Myanmar's restive Rakhine state to Bangladesh a mere 11 months after her birth in 1994.
Myanmar's government has deprived the Rohingya of citizenship since 1982. But as Azeem Ibrahim points out in his book, The Rohingyas: Inside Myanmar's Hidden Genocide, the campaign to exclude them as an official minority group began with Burma's founding 1947 constitution.
Generations of Rohingya have been rendered stateless, and it seems a concerted effort to force them out of their homes and into squalid refugee camps has been undertaken by the Tatmadaw, Myanmar's armed forces.
The Tatmadaw argues it is doing ""security clearance"" in northern Rakhine state, and has issued its own report denying any wrongdoing since these operations began following attacks by the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army on August 25.
""Everybody knows that we are Rohingya but when it comes to documentation, there's no legal proof,"" Sultana told Al Jazeera. ""This is the biggest challenge I'm facing now.""
Three years ago, Sultana came to Malaysia before the country temporarily sealed its borders to refugees fleeing Myanmar and Bangladesh in 2015.
Sultana wanted to continue her studies, and possibly attend a college. She quickly ran into the problem all Rohingya refugees do - the lack of necessary documentation to allow her to study legally in Malaysia.
""I'm sure there are many Rohingya like me who are more talented and educated,"" Sultana said. ""They have a lot of capability and potential but this is a restriction for them.""
Sultana turned to journalism. She began volunteering when she was 19 years old at Rohingya Vision TV, known as RVision to its staff and audience. It broadcasts in Rohingya, English, and Arabic.
Sultana has been offered many opportunities to travel outside of Malaysia for professional journalism training, but she fears that she will not be allowed to return.
""When I started working here I was very emotional hearing all these stories. But now it's part of my daily work schedule,"" she said. ""Thankfully, I have some senior editors who've guided me along the way.""
Ziaur Rahman, 24, is the Rohingya community's most outspoken advocate in the country. He's discussed the crimes perpetrated against the Rohingya directly with Malaysia's Prime Minister Najib Razak three times.
""In Malaysia, we are not getting any protection, were not getting any support from NGOs [non-governmental organisations]. We don't have any rights,"" Rahman said.
Refugees in Malaysia have no legal status, so they can't officially work or attend government-run schools. But Malaysia has allowed space for a ""parallel school system"", according to the UN refugee agency, UNHCR.
These informal primary schools around Malaysia are set up and run by the refugee community itself, or faith-based organisations. The UNHCR directly supports 120 of these refugee schools.
There are 150,000 Rohingya refugees registered with the UNHCR in Malaysia. Some refugee children as old as 18 attend primary level classes.
The Prime Minister's Office said there are 16,809 Rohingya children carrying UNHCR cards, essentially allowing them and family members a discount on medical services at hospitals in Malaysia.
Rohingya Society Malaysia (RSM) is the only refugee community group recognised by the UNHCR. Its President Bo Min Naing said there are nearly 40,000 Rohingya still unregistered.
Sultana and Rahman say the UNHCR card doesn't provide any security or legality in Malaysia. Refugees often work illegally to provide for their families.
Malaysia has no intention to help refugees assimilate or study in government-run schools, fearing more will come. It's providing vital aid to Rohingya displaced in Myanmar and Bangladesh, but refugees argue nothing is being done to help those in Malaysia.
""The UN is doing a lot for us, but it's not doing enough,"" Sultana said. ""Even after getting the card you're liable to be harassed on the road [by authorities]. If you have no education and your children cannot receive education, what is the point of having a [UNHCR] card?""
RSM has supported 126 students since 2009 at its informal Rohingya Learning Centre. Despite its limitation of only three volunteer teachers, it hopes to one day be able to go beyond basic primary education and offer secondary-level classes.
""Our children need education,"" said Bo Min Naing. ""We need to have the opportunity to send our children to the government school until we are able to provide it.""
Rahman said he will speak about the necessity of improving refugee education next time he meets with Malaysia's prime minister. Sultana said she feels responsible for Rohingya's lack of education and voice in the international community.
This is why she loves working as a journalist, reaching her audience online, where many Rohingya refugees have turned to learn about the fate of their loved ones.
""We are denied all human rights. We have no legal documentation. I feel that if I don't raise [this issue], people will not come to help us solve it,"" she said.

The operation on Manus Island began early on Thursday when police issued an ultimatum to the refugees remaining in the camp, saying they had an hour to leave or they would be forced out.
Once the hour was up, officers swept through the facility destroying personal property and supplies of food and water that had been donated by sympathetic locals.
Australia pays Papua New Guinea and the tiny Pacific nation of Nauru to hold thousands of asylum seekers from Africa, the Middle East, and Asia who have attempted to reach Australian shores by boat since mid-2013.
Iranian journalist and refugee applicant Behrouz Boochani was taken into custody after briefly speaking to Al Jazeera by phone.
""The immigration officers and so many special forces suddenly attacked the prison camp,"" Boochani said. ""Immigration officers and police are destroying everything … The refugees are saying 'We're not going to leave this prison camp and go to another prison camp.'""
The police, special forces, police squad are now in their hundreds, spreading through the prison camp and around the prison. Navy soldiers are outside the prison camp. We are on high alert right now. We are under attack.
About 60 men left the camp in buses, but some 300 others said they're too afraid to go outside the former Australian-run facility, fearing attacks by hostile locals.
The prison camp was closed last month after Papua New Guinea's supreme court ruled it was unconstitutional. Since then, the refugees have been living in increasingly filthy conditions without clean water, food, or medical supplies.
Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull denounced the holdout by the refugees.
""They think this is some way they can pressure the Australian government to let them come to Australia. Well, we will not be pressured. I want to be very clear about this … We will not outsource our migration policy to people smugglers,"" Turnbull said.
Earlier this month, Boochani was a winner of the Amnesty International Australian Media Awards in 2017 for his work covering daily life on Manus.
Social media posts by refugees said security officers appeared to target Boochani and a second man, Abdul Aziz Adam, who had been reporting on the siege since the standoff began.
They are looking for me and Behrouz they found him but they are not going to find me. These are police are taking Behrouz. pic.twitter.com/G01bA46ETC
In response to Boochani's arrest, the Australian journalists union, the Media, Entertainment and Arts Alliance, issued a statement from its Chief Executive Paul Murphy describing the situation as an attack on press freedom.
""Behrouz has been one of the main sources of factual information about conditions inside the Manus Island detention centre for the past few years, and his reporting has been published in Australia and internationally,"" Murphy said.
""His reporting in the finest traditions of journalism has been critical when the Australian and PNG governments have done everything they can to prevent media from having access to the asylum seekers on Manus Island.""
Boochani said he was released about two hours after being handcuffed behind the camp.
Besides food supplies and mobile phones, medicine for the sick was also allegedly destroyed by security officers.
Patrick McGorry, a professor of youth mental health at the University of Melbourne, said the refugees were likely suffering from psychological problems as well.
""These men are chronically suicidal, they're extremely demoralised after four years of incarceration with no real hope about their future. Even though they are genuine refugees, there's really no clear plan for resettlement for them,"" McGorry said.
The UN refugee agency said in a statement the use of ""excessive force"" cannot be used against the holdouts.
""We urge both governments to engage in constructive dialogue, to de-escalate the current tensions and work on urgent lasting solutions to their plight,"" said Volker Turk, UNHCR's assistant high commissioner for protection.
Australian Immigration Minister Peter Dutton blamed destruciton at the camp on the refugees.
""They've trashed the facility. They're living in squalor,"" Dutton told local media. ""The Australian taxpayers have paid about $10m for a new facility - and we want people to move.""
Australia officially closed its Manus Island detention centre on October 31, but 600 men originally refused to leave citing fears for their safety.
While New Zealand made an offer to resettle 150 men, it was rejected by Australia's prime minister on the basis it may revive the people-smuggling trade.

Police and immigration officials entered the camp on Thursday morning to persuade the men to leave for alternative accommodation in the nearby town of Lorengau.
Refugees holed up in the camp reported that their shelters, beds and other belongings were destroyed by policemen.

Water, power and food supplies ended when the camp on Manus Island officially closed on October 31, based on the Papua New Guinea Supreme Court's ruling last year that Australia's policy of housing asylum seekers there was unconstitutional.
Authorities have previously made conditions tougher in the camp by emptying drinking water tanks and removing shelters. Since then, the refugees have been living in increasingly filthy conditions, without clean water or supplies.
Shen Narayanasamy, human rights director of Getup!, an Australian campaign group, visited the camp and told Al Jazeera that living conditions there were appalling.
""I have a background in post-conflict zones. Conditions we witnessed were worse than I have seen; overcrowded; sleeping in shipping containers; no water; men had not had food,"" Narayanasamy said.
""These men have been detained for over four years, vast majority being legally refugees. The legal situation is that it's clearly Australia's responsibility. Papua New Guinea shares some but it was Australia that forced these people to go there,"" she added.
""The legal situation also makes it clear that this is a human rights crisis. Four years ago, Amnesty International called it a catastrophe. This is a crisis perpetuated by the Australian government.""

Thousands of asylum seekers - many of whom were from Haiti - have already walked across the border into the province of Quebec without visas since the start of the year to make asylum claims in Canada.
On November 20, the Trump administration announced it would lift Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Haitian nationals, who will now have 18 months - until July 22, 2019 - to formalise their status in the US or leave the country.
That decision will lead to a new wave of arrivals at the US-Canada border, said Frantz Andre of the Non-Status Action Committee, a community group in Montreal that supports newcomers from Haiti.
""The new wave has already started,"" Andre told Al Jazeera in a telephone interview on Wednesday.
Asylum seekers already living in the US cannot make their claims for protection in Canada at a formal border crossing because of a bilateral agreement between the two countries, the Safe Third Country Agreement.
That deal makes it impossible for asylum seekers who first land in the US, and whose demands for protection are denied, to seek asylum in Canada, and vice-versa.
That has pushed families to cross into Canada on foot; once they are in the country, they can have their asylum claim heard.
According to Andre, while the Canadian government has said it is preparing to handle a new influx of irregular border crossings, the system is still ""improvised"".
""We're again denouncing this lack of a system to treat each request ... in a way that will be efficient and really give a chance to the asylum seeker,"" he told Al Jazeera.
""Currently, that's not the case.""
In the US, TPS visas were extended to foreign nationals living in the country who the government decided could not safely return to their home countries due to war, violence, natural disasters and other reasons.
As of October, 437,000 foreign nationals from 10 countries held TPS immigration status.
Haitian immigrants and supporters rallied in New York for TPS to continue for Haiti [Eduardo Munoz/Reuters]
This week, Elaine Duke, the acting secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, announced the US had determined that Haitians who received TPS coverage after a 2010 earthquake devastated the country and led to a humanitarian crisis, could safely return home.
""Significant steps have been taken to improve the stability and quality of life for Haitian citizens, and Haiti is able to safely receive traditional levels of returned citizens,"" the department said in a statement.
""Haiti has also demonstrated a commitment to adequately prepare for when the country’s TPS designation is terminated.""
The Haiti decision comes after the US announced it would lift TPS coverage for about 2,500 Nicaraguans, who will now have until January 5, 2019, to leave the country.
About 57,000 Hondurans with TPS visas are also living in limbo, as the US government said it would extend their coverage until July while it makes a final decision on their coverage under the programme.
The US government created uncertainty in Haitian communities in the US earlier this year when it hinted that TPS may be cancelled for Haitians as early as January 2018.
As rumours swirled about pending deportations, thousands of Haitians fled to the Canada-US border.
More than 5,500 people crossed into Quebec without permits in August, many of them Haitians, according to Canadian police figures.
Overall, more than 15,000 people have crossed the border irregularly to claim refugee status in Canada so far this year, Reuters reported.
""Under the law, anyone claiming asylum in Canada has the right to due process,"" said Remi Lariviere, a spokesperson for Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada, the federal department of immigration.
""However, there are no guarantees that an asylum seeker will be allowed to stay in Canada at the end of this process,"" Lariviere told Al Jazeera in an email.
In September, 5,390 asylum seekers crossed into Canada irregularly, according to data collected by the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada (IRB), an independent body that rules on asylum and refugee claims.
Of the 177 refugee claims that were finalised that month, 114 were accepted, IRB figures show. That's an acceptance rate of 64.4 percent.
A tweet posted by Justin Trudeau, Canada's prime minister, earlier this year also gave many families hope that they would easily be granted asylum once they reached Canada
""To those fleeing persecution, terror & war, Canadians will welcome you,"" Trudeau wrote.
To those fleeing persecution, terror & war, Canadians will welcome you, regardless of your faith. Diversity is our strength #WelcomeToCanada
However, the newcomers quickly saw they would have to begin a new and lengthy immigration process on the Canadian side of the border.
""These people find themselves in an overloaded [immigration] system,"" Andre said.
Canada ended its temporary deportation protection - known as a Temporary Suspension of Removals - for Haitians in 2014, citing improved conditions in the country.
Since then, acceptance rates for Haitian nationals' asylum claims in Canada have remained low.
In 2016, only 50 percent of finalised asylum applications were granted to Haitian claimants, up from 40 percent in 2015, according to IRB figures.
Andre told Al Jazeera that activists are calling for Canada to give refugee claimants two years to properly prepare and file their applications.
That will allow the government to set up a better system, he said, and ""take away some of the anguish and the stress"" families are feeling as they navigate the immigration system.
When they cross into Canada, asylum seekers are first intercepted by the RCMP, Canada's federal police.
When they say they want to apply for asylum or refugee status, they will be transferred to the Canadian Border Services Agency (CBSA) for an interview on their eligibility.
If deemed eligible, they will then be released pending an interview with the IRB. Asylum seekers can prove a need for protection based on several criteria, including religious, racial or political persecution.
Gloria Nafziger, a refugee campaigner at Amnesty International Canada, told Al Jazeera the human rights group expects ""ongoing arrivals"" at the border, but ""it's just impossible to know how large that [number is] going to get"".
She said the arrivals appear to be fuelled by US immigration policy announcements, ""which make people feel insecure"".
""They look for options, and Canada is one of those options,"" Nafziger said.
Amnesty is calling on Canada to rescind the Safe Third Country Agreement, which would allow people to make asylum claims at a formal border crossing and avoid potential dangers of crossing on foot, she said.
""Particularly as winter comes and people may try to take more dangerous routes into Canada, the risks increase substantially,"" Nafziger said.
After the first major waves of asylum seekers began arriving, Ottawa sent MPs to the US to discourage would-be refugee claimants - especially those from Haiti and Nicaragua, who have been impacted by the TPS decisions - from attempting to come to Canada.
That outreach appears to be continuing and Lariviere said Ottawa is ""in continuous contact"" with the US government on this issue.
He said the federal government is ""aware that the potential exists for more people crossing the border"".
""To be clear, entering illegally is not a 'free ticket' into Canada,"" Lariviere said.
""There are rigorous immigration and customs rules to be followed - and make no mistake - we enforce them to safeguard our communities against security risks.""
David Heurtel, Quebec immigration minister, is expected to attend a meeting with representatives of the federal government on Thursday in Ottawa to discuss the issue.
While he told French-language Montreal newspaper La Presse that Quebec ""does not expect a new wave [of asylum seekers] right away"", Heurtel said the province ""will do everything [it] can to limit a surprise"".

In a joint statement on Wednesday, the Greek and international organisations said thousands of people faced the bleak prospect of being forced to endure freezing temperatures in summer tents.
""This remains a matter of life and death,"" Jana Frey, Greece country director for the International Rescue Committee, said in the statement.
""There is absolutely no excuse for the conditions on the islands right now - thousands of people crammed into overcrowded and desperately under-resourced facilities,"" she added, calling for asylum seekers to be ""allowed to move, in an organised and voluntary fashion, to the mainland"".
Hotspots on the islands of Lesbos, Samos and Chios were hosting 7,000 more people than they were designed to accommodate as of November 20, according to the human rights and aid groups.
""Nothing can justify trapping people in these terrible conditions on the islands for another winter,"" said Eva Cosse, Greece researcher at Human Rights Watch (HRW), in the statement.
In March 2016, the EU and Turkey reached a deal to stem the flow of refugees from Turkey to Europe, while countries across the Balkans sealed their borders. Those measures have led to a build-up of more than 60,000 refugees and migrants in Greece.
Barring emergencies, asylum seekers are banned from travelling to mainland Greece, where better conditions and services are available, until their asylum process has been completed.
""Following the EU-Turkey statement, asylum seekers may wait for lengthy periods to complete procedures, in some cases over a year,"" Boris Cheshirkov, spokesman for the United Nations' refugee agency (UNHCR), told Al Jazeera.
""These delays have contributed to the present overcrowded conditions in the hotspots and the effects of the geographical restriction which keeps asylum seekers on the islands for extended periods must be considered.""
In their statement, the prominent groups called on Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras to end ""the containment policy"" and take the necessary precautions to ensure that no asylum seekers are sleeping in tents before severe winter weather arrives.
The Greek Ministry of Migration did not reply to Al Jazeera's request for a comment.
Among the groups that signed the statement were IRC, HRW, Amnesty International, ActionAid, Help Refugees and others.
Their warning comes amid soaring tensions on Greek islands, where the presence of refugees has become the subject of protests by locals and measures by law enforcement.
In Mytilene, the capital of Lesbos, police on Tuesday reportedly evicted several people when a group of hunger-striking refugees camped out in the town's square refused to be transferred to another area outside the centre.
Also on Tuesday, local media reported that at least seven refugees were arrested in the Moria camp, a closed facility, for arson, attempting to cause bodily injury, disruption of the peace and other violations.
The arrests came a day after residents of Lesbos went on strike against the presence of more than 8,500 asylum seekers on the island.
Spyros Galinos, the mayor of Lesbos, insisted that the island's inhabitants have ""struggled day and night for months on to shelter people who suffered from the consequences of war"" throughout the last three years.
Around a million refugees passed through the island during that period, he added.
""Today though, we feel abandoned and forgotten by both the Greek government and the European Union, as both our community and the refugees are getting punished,"" he told Al Jazeera on Wednesday.
""For months now, I kept appealing to both Athens and Brussels to take action as the refugee crisis is intensifying again.""
Galinos added: ""Lesbos, an island of democracy, humanity, and culture, is slowly turning into an open-air detention camp, a large jail where refugees are living under abhorrent conditions, and our community is coming under unbearable pressure, risking falling prey to extremist and populist rhetoric.""
More than 25,000 refugees and migrants have crossed the Aegean Sea to Greek islands from Turkey so far this year, according to the United Nations' refugee agency (UNHCR). Of that total, children make up more than 37 percent.
The majority of arrivals have fled war in Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan.
Cheshirkov, the UNHCR spokesman, explained that the humanitarian situation on the islands has rapidly declined amid increasing refugee arrivals.
On Lesbos, more than 6,000 people are crowded in the Moria camp, which was designed to hold less than 2,000.
""Right now, it is dangerous for children, families, and vulnerable people to stay in Moria. Conditions could still deteriorate if overcrowding persists and as colder weather sets in,"" Cheshirkov told Al Jazeera by email.
In Vial, a camp on Chios, more than 2,000 people live in a space meant to hold 1,000, he added.
On Samos, more than 1,600 are crammed in a camp equipped for 700, according to Cheshirkov.
Speaking to the Greek daily Ekathimerini earlier this month, Migration Minister Yiannis Mouzalas defended the Greek government's policy towards asylum seekers and the EU-Turkey deal.
""Despite the difficulties of [the deal], which has gray areas Europe must clarify, it is a useful agreement for Greece,” he said.
""Migration and refugee flows of this magnitude have to be dealt with, with agreements of this sort.""

https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/11/hungary-campaign-george-soros-171122120334509.html,refugee,1150,Wed Nov 22 2017 17:48:18 GMT+0000,Patrick Strickland,What's behind Hungary's campaign against George Soros? ,"Rights groups and watchdogs say a Hungarian government campaign against investor and philanthropist George Soros has reached fever pitch, and it is being used to further a crackdown on civil society.
Soros, an 86-year-old who was born in Hungary and is of Jewish descent, has been the focal point of attacks by Prime Minister Viktor Orban and his Fidesz party and other far-right nationalist outfits for years.
Yet, recent months have seen a surge in anti-Soros rhetoric, that critics say is rooted in a desire to deflect attention from what they describe as a government crackdown on rights groups and civil society.
Much of the antipathy stems from the policies advocated by the Open Society Foundations, a Soros-founded organisation that campaigns for strengthening civil society, advancing human rights and combating corruption.
In Eastern and Central European countries, the Open Society Foundations has pushed for greater acceptance of refugees and migrants, putting it at odds with right-wing governments and far-right political parties.
In July, the Hungarian government accused Soros of attempting to ""Muslimise"" Europe. Earlier this year, Orban, who is facing re-election in April 2018, led a campaign to shut down the Central European University (CEU), which was founded by Soros.
On Monday, the Open Society Foundations pushed back, alleging in a statement that Orban and his political allies are orchestrating a campaign of ""distortion and lies"" about him, pointing to seven of Orban's statements that attacked Soros.
Among those were claims that Soros hoped to resettle a million refugees in the European Union and allot them thousands of euros each.
Balint Bardi, a Budapest-based Hungarian journalist, says the anti-Soros campaign is part of a broader strategy to ""exploit the xenophobic feelings"" of many Hungarians in order to ""gain popularity for the government"".
""The government has been using this strategy since the beginning of the refugee crisis,"" Bardi told Al Jazeera by phone.
""They say there is a threat from our country from the migrants, from the politicians in Brussels or George Soros ... and that the government is the only one that can defend Hungarian society.""
He said the overwhelming focus on Soros compounds the anti-refugee propaganda and hostility towards international journalists and press outlets that do not support the government.
""This is very bad for Hungarian society,"" Bardi said.
At a press conference on Monday, Gergely Gulyas, leader of the Fidesz parliamentary group, accused Soros of a ""full frontal"" attack on Hungary.
""So far, George Soros has attacked Hungary and the Hungarian government through the organisations he funds, the European Parliament and his allies in Brussels; but he has now entered the battle in person,"" Gulyas said, referring to the Open Society Foundations' statement on Monday.
""George Soros is now attacking Hungary openly ... because in its immigration policy Hungary continues to stand its ground against the forces supporting immigration.""
Gulyas said Hungary ""must not become an immigrant country"".
Contacted by Al Jazeera, the Hungarian government's International Communications Office declined to comment on the issue.
The campaign against Soros has been unfolding alongside an apparent crackdown on civil society, including organisations affiliated with Soros and several that are not linked to him.
In October, the Orban administration ordered the country's intelligence services to investigate what it called an ""empire"" of Soros-backed institutions that work in Hungary.
Nora Koves, a Hungarian human rights expert, said the government has increasingly targeted civil society institutions since 2013.
""Now it's just continuing with Soros. It's not only the nongovernmental organisations (NGOs) being targeted and not only the migrants,"" said Koves, who works for the Budapest-based Eotvos Karoly Policy Institute, which has received funding from Soros-supported foundations.
""He is the perfect enemy because he is invisible and the Hungarian people will never meet him personally.""
In July, the parliament passed a law imposing strict rules on NGOs that receive foreign funding, requiring those that receive more than $26,000 a year from international sources to be registered as ""foreign-supported"".
With the strongest opposition groups being an increasingly fractious Socialist Party and Jobbik, an ultra-nationalist party accused of having neo-Nazi roots, Koves is holding out little hope for political pushback against the government's clampdown on civil society.
""Basically, we are the last critics standing in Hungary. The opposition is completely useless; people don't believe in them,"" she said. ""But civil society is a whole different thing. We are the professional criticism of the government.
""They want to demolish it. If you want a perfect autocracy, then obviously you need to do this.""
Many in Hungary say the charges levelled at Soros, who survived the Holocaust, have an odour of latent anti-Semitism.
""The government is denying that is anti-Jewish propaganda against Soros, but many people think this is the case,"" Koves said.
For years, governments across Central and Eastern Europe have blamed Soros for unrest and protests.
Earlier this year, Romania's ruling party claimed that anti-corruption protests were orchestrated by Soros.
In Poland, Jarosław Kaczynski, leader of the Law and Justice Party and a former prime minister, accused Soros-funded organisations of advocating ""societies without identity"".
Anti-Soros measures and rhetoric have also become part and parcel of politics in countries including Serbia, Bulgaria and Slovakia.
In the US and Europe, white supremacists and far-right commentators have pushed the widely debunked conspiracy theory that Soros was a Nazi collaborator, an officer in the German Schutzstaffel (SS) paramilitary and helped confiscate Jewish property for the Nazis and their allies during the second world war.
Meanwhile, the Hungarian government, which has stridently opposed EU quotas on refugee distribution throughout member states, has styled itself as the defender of ""Christian Europe"" in the face of Muslim refugees, supposedly encouraged to come to Hungary by Soros and others.
Lydia Gall, a Central and Eastern Europe researcher at Human Rights Watch, said that much of the anti-Soros rhetoric is ""reminiscent of Nazi propaganda from the 1930s"".
Gall alluded to government-funded anti-Soros hoardings visible across the capital and in small villages in the countryside, which often show images of Soros ""depicted as the traditional grinning Jew"" and play on ""stereotypes that have been floating around against Jews for aeons of history"".
""The government is creating external enemies by linking refugees and asylum-seekers to terrorism, and claiming they are encouraged to come [to Hungary] by NGOs, which are in turn financed and supported by Soros,"" she told Al Jazeera.
Referring to the anti-Soros tone of political discourse in Hungary, Serbia, Macedonia and Poland, among other countries, Gall said it should ""prompt some action on behalf of the EU as a whole"".
In Hungary, she said, the strategy has been largely effective. An opinion poll published earlier this month found that the ruling Fidesz party maintains a 61-percent support rating, as reported by Hungarian Free Press.
""When we see these types of illiberal and authoritarian tendencies in Europe and in the middle of the European Union, alarm bells should be ringing,"" Gall said.

The Israeli cabinet approved a proposal on Sunday to close the Holot detention centre, a facility in the southern Negev (Naqab) desert that currently houses just over 1,000 African asylum seekers, according to Israeli daily Haaretz.
Put forward by the interior and public security ministers, the proposal would see Holot shuttered by mid-March 2018.
Asylum seekers in Israel would then be forced to choose between indefinite detention in an Israeli prison, or deportation to a third country in Africa - named in the local media as Rwanda - with or without their explicit consent.
Currently, Israel is home to about 40,000 asylum seekers, according to government figures. That includes 27,500 Eritrean and 7,800 Sudanese asylum seekers, the UN refugee agency (UNHCR) has reported.
The proposal is expected to go to the Ministerial Committee for Legislation for consideration, Haaretz said.
Sigal Rozen, head of public policy at the Tel Aviv-based Hotline for Refugees and Migrants, told Al Jazeera that Israel's plan is immoral and a violation of both international and Israeli laws.
""We are alert to see what is happening on the ground,"" Rozen said.
Many asylum seekers are panicking at the news that they could be deported against their will, Rozen said, and some have already registered to leave on their own accord.
""If that's the case, then [the government] might not need to detain people and to take them by force ... It looks as if this is part of the plan,"" she said.
""The main policy is detention and deportation.""
Israel's interior ministry did not immediately respond to Al Jazeera's request for comment.
The proposal appears to go against an Israeli High Court of Justice decision from August, that ruled that while Israel could deport asylum seekers to a third country, it could not threaten them with indefinite detention in order to get them to leave.
However, in a statement on Sunday, Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, said Israel's policy towards asylum seekers - whom he referred to as ""infiltrators"" - has entered a third phase that can be described as ""increased removal"".
""This removal is enabled thanks to an international agreement I achieved, which allows us to remove the 40,000 remaining infiltrators without their consent. This is very important,"" he said.
While Netanyahu did not explicitly name the third country in Africa that asylum seekers would be deported to, local media has named it as Rwanda.
Israel plans to pay Rwanda $5,000 for each asylum seeker it agrees to take in, Haaretz reported.
It will also pay each asylum seeker $3,500 and pay for their flight out of the country, the newspaper reported.
""It will enable us later to make the Holot facility unnecessary and to use part of the vast resources we allocate there for inspectors and increased removal. That is why we are succeeding here. But our goal is to continue removing significantly more then (sic) what we have until now,"" Netanyahu said.
Most asylum seekers in Israel are from Sudan and Eritrea. They arrived in the country over the last decade via Egypt and most have fled war, torture and other mistreatment.
Between December 2013 and June of this year, about 4,000 Sudanese and Eritrean asylum seekers were deported under Israel's ""voluntary departure programme"" to Rwanda and Uganda, according to the UN's refugee agency.
UNHCR expressed concerns about this week's proposal, saying that ""the secrecy surrounding this policy and the lack of transparency concerning its implementation"" has made it ""very difficult for UNHCR to follow up and systematically monitor the situation of people relocated to these African countries"".
""As party to the 1951 Refugee Convention, Israel has legal obligations to protect refugees and other persons in need of international protection,"" Volker Turk, UNHCR's assistant high commissioner for protection, said in a statement.
Though it is a signatory to the convention, Israel has only recognised eight Eritrean and two Sudanese asylum seekers as refugees since 2009, according to UNHCR. Two hundred Sudanese refugees from the Darfur region were also granted humanitarian status.
Israel has pressured asylum seekers and refugees to leave the country for years, through a series of restrictive laws, the threat of arrest and detention at the Holot prison, and limits on their movement and access to employment and education.
According to Rozen, the government has maintained a policy that aims to make life in Israel so unbearable for asylum seekers that they choose to leave on their own.
""All this together is created to make them feel unsafe and unwanted,"" she said. ""[If] they will continue leaving quickly, then there will be no need to deport.""

Judge Elizabeth A Wolford ruled that the facility in New York state must stop detaining asylum seekers ""without a fair opportunity for release"" on parole or bond, the International Refugee Assistance Program (IRAP) and the New York Civil Liberties Union (NYCLU) said in a statement on Monday.
The two groups, which filed a suit in July, said asylum seekers are entitled to be considered for release on parole while awaiting their hearings.
But the practice at the Buffalo Federal Detention Facility ""effectively stopped"" in late January, leaving dozens of people in detention.
The alleged activity violates both the law and a 2009 internal ICE policy (PDF) that says asylum seekers who prove they are not a flight risk or threat should be released on parole or bond, Aadhithi Padmanabhan, the NYCLU's lead counsel on the case, told Al Jazeera.
He said that it could take ""months and years"" for asylum seekers to have a hearing before an immigration judge.
The Buffalo detention centre is a 650-bed facility, the largest of its kind in the state of New York. It is located roughly 80km from the US-Canada border in the town of Batavia.
Mariko Hirose, IRAP's litigation director, told Al Jazeera that full information for all asylum seekers at the facility is not yet available yet.
However, of the 28 cases from which IRAP and the NYCLU have data, the average length of detention is 387 days.
Immigration Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers at the centre were also accused of not providing information in languages the asylum seekers can understand.
However, following the judge's order on Friday, ""asylum seekers will be notified of the availability of parole in a language they understand"", the groups said.
The asylum seekers will also ""be given a parole interview with an immigration officer, be provided an explanation for their parole decision and be informed they can seek reconsideration if parole is initially denied"".
Parole rates dropped significantly in the last year of the Obama administration, falling to 50 percent by the end of his presidency.
These rates fell to less than 15 percent during the first seven months of the administration of President Donald Trump, according to the July lawsuit.
Trump's government has been accused of taking a hardline stance against immigrants and refugees, initiating deportation crackdowns, pushing for a wall on the US-Mexico border and issuing a series of executive orders known as ""Muslim bans"" that dramatically limit refugee numbers.
Christopher Dunn, associated legal director of the NYCLU, which worked with IRAP on the filing of the lawsuit, said in the groups' statement that the judge's decision was ""a strong rebuke to the Trump administration's campaign against immigrants"".
Wolford, the presiding judge, wrote in her decision that Hanad Abdi, a 26-year-old native of Somalia, and Johan Barrios Ramos, a 40-year-old from Cuba, came to the US with a ""credible fear of returning to their homelands"" due to the ""significant possibility"" of torture or persecution.
Abdi, a member of a minority tribe in Somalia, said he was captured and beaten by a larger, more powerful tribe after they killed his father.
""I fled persecution in Somalia and came to America because people all around the world think of this country as a beacon of hope,"" Abdi said in the groups' statement.
""But during the 10 months I was imprisoned at Batavia, not knowing why I was jailed or how I could get out, I felt hopeless.""
Barrios Ramos left Cuba in 2016 after engaging in anti-government protests. He claims he was tortured by Cuban law enforcement after being arrested.
""I fled Cuba where I was a political prisoner and came to America seeking freedom,"" Barrios Ramos said. ""I was shocked when I got here and asked for asylum but was instead put in jail"".
Continuing to detain Barrios Ramos and Abdi ""without any appropriate process"" would result in ""extreme or very serious irreparable harm,"" Wolford wrote.
When asked for comment on the decision, ICE told Al Jazeera it ""will not comment directly to any litigation or ruling"".
Padmanabhan said the groups' legal team is ""going to follow up"" with asylum seekers inside the detention centre to make sure the order is properly implemented.

https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/11/state-solution-171119093352403.html,refugee,1116,Mon Nov 20 2017 07:15:15 GMT+0000,Farah Najjar,Why there can never be a two-state solution ,"For the past 50 years, a United Nations Security Council resolution has helped to sustain Israel's occupation of Palestine, analysts say.
Ghada Karmi, a British-Palestinian author and lecturer at Exeter University's Institute of Arab and Islamic studies, says the central issue is that Israelis ""never intended"" to comply with UNSC Resolution 242, adopted on November 22, 1967.
""From the steady colonisation of the Palestinian area, you can see that there has been no attempt on the part of Israel to comply with any part of the resolution,"" she said.
Following the 1967 Arab-Israeli war, a resolution called on Israel to give up the territories it occupied in exchange for a lasting peace with its neighbours.
Israel defeated the armies of Egypt, Jordan and Syria, resulting in the Palestinian ""Naksa"", or setback, in June 1967.
In that year, Israel expelled some 430,000 Palestinians from their homes. The Naksa was perceived as an extension of the 1948 Nakba, or catastrophe, which accompanied the founding of the state of Israel.
In a matter of six days, Israel seized the remainder of historic Palestine, including the West Bank, East Jerusalem and Gaza, as well as the Syrian Golan Heights and the Egyptian Sinai Peninsula. Later that year, Israel annexed East Jerusalem as well.
Apart from the Sinai Peninsula, all the other territories remain occupied to this day.
Under the sponsorship of the British ambassador to the UN at the time, Resolution 242 aimed to implement a ""just and lasting peace in the Middle East"" region.
The resolution's preamble explicitly prohibited the continuation of Israeli control over territory that was acquired by force during the war, citing ""the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by war and the need to work for a just and lasting peace in which every State in the area can live in security"".
The resolution called on Israel to withdraw its forces from territories it had occupied in the Six-Day War, and urged all parties to acknowledge each other's territorial sovereignty.
UN Security Council Resolution 242, Article 1
However, the resolution was used by Israel to continue its occupation of the territories, as it also called for ""achieving a just settlement of the refugee problem"" while falling short of addressing the Palestinian people's right to statehood, analysts note.
As a result, the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), which at the time was perceived by the international community and by the UN as the representative of the Palestinian people, refused to acknowledge the resolution until two decades later.
The resolution was later used as the basis for Arab-Israeli peace negotiations and the notion of creating a two-state solution along the internationally recognised 1967 borders.
But in the US-based Journal of Palestine Studies, lawyer and Georgetown University professor Noura Erekat wrote that Israel has used Resolution 242 to justify the seizure of Palestinian land.
""When Israel declared its establishment in May 1948, it denied that Arab Palestinians had a similar right to statehood as the Jews because the Arab countries had rejected the Partition Plan,"" Erekat wrote, referencing UN Resolution 181.
The final language of Resolution 242 did not correct the failure to realise Palestinian self-determination, referring merely to the ""refugee problem"", she added.
""Following the 1967 war, Israel argued that given the sovereign void in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip the territories were neither occupied nor not occupied,"" Erekat said, noting that Israel used this argument ""to steadily grab Palestinian land without absorbing the Palestinians on the land"".
Though Resolution 242 qualifies ""occupied territories"" as those areas occupied or acquired during the war, analysts say Israel used the ""vagueness"" of the language to its benefit.
""[Israel and its allies] are saying there isn't anything specific - there aren't any specific territories mentioned - which means, 'We can have this or that,'"" Karmi said.
""This whole vagueness argument is artificial, to throw dust in the eye. The problem with the resolution is that it has never been implemented. That is one of the most serious things about it.""
Mouin Rabbani, a senior fellow at the Washington-based Institute for Palestine Studies, said the political context of the time was the underlying force behind the resolution's lack of execution.
""Israel's victory in 1967 was largely seen as an American victory as much as an Israeli victory,"" Rabbani told Al Jazeera. ""This was in the height of the cold war.""
The United States' UN representative at the time played a significant role in trying to steer the resolution in Israel's favour, he said.
""It [Israel] had absolutely no intention of leaving, and it never came under sufficient political or military pressure whereby the costs of remaining in the occupied territories became higher than benefits of doing so,"" he said.
The importance of Resolution 242 actually came much later, after political developments formed the basis of an international consensus for a two-state-solution - a notion that began to emerge among the Palestinian leadership in the 1970s, Rabbani said.
""Today, we always talk about the Palestinian/Israeli conflict - that didn't really exist at the time,"" he said. ""It was the Arab/Israeli conflict and the question of Palestine.""
The fact that Palestinian statehood was not awarded much significance in the resolution is not the outcome of deliberate sidelining; rather, it is due to the political lens in which Palestine was seen at the time.
Despite the fact that Resolution 242 paved the way for negotiations, it is now ""completely irrelevant"", Karmi said.
""The basic issue to resolve this conflict is return. This is the basic issue - these people [the Palestinians] are dispossessed,"" she said.
But even with a series of brokered peace talks, there has been no real progress towards implementing a two-state solution, with discussions at a stalemate amid the expansion of Jewish settlements.
The soaring settlement project, which is in direct contravention of international law, has brought around 600,000 Israelis into dozens of Jewish settlements throughout the occupied West Bank. Israeli authorities expropriate Palestinian land and carry out home demolitions on a regular basis, most commonly to expand existing settlements, or occasionally to build new ones.
Checkpoints and Israel's separation wall have further hindered Palestinians' freedom of movement.
""Israel is totally in control of the Palestinian territories - not just the West Bank, but also Gaza,"" Karmi said.
The Gaza Strip, home to about two million people, has been under siege for more than a decade. In 2007, after the election victory of Hamas and the group's assumption of control over the territory, Israel imposed a strict land, aerial and naval blockade.
""The fact of total Israeli control of 100 percent of Palestine is precisely and fundamentally why you can't have a two-state solution,"" Karmi said.

The northwestern city bears scars of the government-led offensive last year, and those living in east Aleppo need assistance to regain a sense of normalcy, aid workers told Al Jazeera.
Around 300,000 displaced Aleppans have returned to the east of the city since the start of 2017, according to the United Nations refugee agency, UNHCR.
""The humanitarian situation is slightly getting better, but there is a lot of destruction still in the city, be it in terms of infrastructure or the houses of the families,"" Ingy Sedky, a spokesperson for the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) in Syria, told Al Jazeera in a telephone interview from Damascus.
With some neighbourhoods ""still totally destroyed"", there are also growing concerns over shortages of electricity and clean water. Many residents are relying on generators, which cost around $3 per ampere a week.
Aid organisations are helping to meet the water needs by providing tanks, but more must be done to fully restore the supply.
Daily meals, winter supplies, medical assistance and post-traumatic rehabilitation are also being provided to try to get the city back to the ""pre-crisis level"".
""The availability of services is very limited,"" said Massimo Diana, the Syria representative for the United Nations Population Fund.
Syrian government forces, backed by allied groups and Russia, launched a major offensive to retake rebel-held districts of eastern Aleppo one year ago, in September 2016.
As the fighting intensified in November, bloody images of trapped civilians, bombed hospitals and distraught children flooded the news.
At least 463 civilians died, including 62 children, according to the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. After a month-long army onslaught, Syrian government forces ""fully recaptured"" eastern Aleppo from the rebels on December 22, 2016.
A year since the deadly battle, Aleppo has again come under heavy bombardment by government warplanes targeting rebel fighters in recent weeks.
More than 60 people were killed and dozens more wounded in three air raids on a busy market in Atareb, a town in the Aleppo countryside, earlier this week.
""We believe that the biggest challenge for the residents currently is the military checkpoints spread in the eastern neighbourhoods, due to fear of arrest and forced disappearance,"" said Fadel Abdul Ghany, the founder of the Syrian Network for Human Rights.
Ayman Al-Sheikh, who worked as a surgeon for the Syrian American Medical Society in Aleppo for four years before it was evacuated, said people just want an end to all the ""killing, the bombing and air strikes"".
""They [civilians] want their rights, equality and freedom,"" said Sheikh, who now works in Idlib.
The Aleppo Project, an open collaboration among Syrian refugees, students, academics and policy experts, is looking to help the rebuilding process.
The four-member team based in Budapest has interviewed more than 1,000 Aleppans - both at home and in exile - about their relationship with the city, experiences with war and displacement, and vision for the future.
AlHakam Shaar, a research fellow with the Aleppo Project, said that despite corruption and a lack of security and services, progress has been made - but the biggest challenge is the return of displaced residents.
""With a semi-functional system, the fear of persecution and the extortion at security checkpoints, the displaced cannot return, much of the city will not be rebuilt, and cosmopolitan Aleppo will be reduced to a shadow of its past self,"" Shaar told Al Jazeera in an email interview.
Still, Diana said, it remains important to restore hope among civilians and to give them a sense that the ""worst is over"".
Damascus resident Iad Tawil, who studied law at the University of Aleppo, spent his recent Eid-al-Fitr holidays with friends and family in Aleppo. The celebrations were ""not about the pleasure; it was more about the relief"", he said.
""People of Aleppo actually like to live, they love to live.""

The journey first took her to Ireland, then the Czech Republic, and later to the UK, where she spent a decade living in London.
It was there that she underwent a spiritual transformation, leaving the Christianity of her upbringing behind for a faith few in her native land knew much about.
""Islam showed me God like I had always felt I seen,"" she told Al Jazeera, describing how the decision prompted a reaction of disappointment from her mother.
Initially heated conversations about Islam, however, turned more conciliatory, and eventually, Lachowska's mother came to defend her daughter's decision.
""Whenever she is on the phone with some relatives from Poland, if they say something 'anti-Islamic', she bravely argues with them, defends Islam, defends my choice, alhamdulillah (thank God).""
Lachowska's relatives are not alone in their negative opinion of Islam, and the scale of anti-Muslim feeling in the country was on display at Saturday's Polish independence day march, which drew around 60,000 people, many of them from far-right groups.
One banner carried by protesters showed a trojan horse labelled ""Islam"" attempting to enter a fortress marked ""Europe"".
Inside the trojan horse was a stereotyped caricature of a Middle Eastern man with a long nose, wearing a suicide vest and carrying a banner which read ""I'm a refugee.""
Fears of Islam and an influx of refugees to Poland, similar to what neighbouring EU countries experienced, have been amplified by politicians and sections of the media, according to Konrad Pedziwiatr of the Cracow University of Economics.
""Most of the information people get about Islam and Muslims comes from the media, and what has been happening over the last few years especially is this tendency to lump together the issues of terrorism, the refugee crisis, and Islam,"" he said.
""You always had politicians who had strong opinions against Islam, but the refugee crisis helped jack the cause and helped the Law and Justice party come to power."" Poland's largest party came to power in 2015 on a platform of restoring Polish pride and keeping refugees out of the country.
Konrad Pedziwiatr, Cracow University of Economics
Pedziwiatr explained that the rise of Islamophobia in political life had been in tandem with increasingly unfavourable coverage of Muslims in the media, especially state media outlets.
""Whenever the issue of Islam and Muslims is there, it's always (represented) in a super negative way,"" he said.
The combined effect of vilified political and media discourse on Islam, he argued, has brought about a ""banalisation"" of Islamophobia and led to many Poles holding inaccurate perceptions about the Muslim community.
Muslims make up just 0.1 percent of the Polish population, or around 35,000 people, including indigenous Polish Muslims, such as the Tatars, converts, and immigrants from all over the world.
However, the average citizen believes the number is much higher.
""Poles hugely overestimate the size of the Muslim community, the average that people think is seven percent, which is ridiculous because it means over two and a half million people,"" Pedziwiatr said, explaining that such perceptions were of ""the Polish fear of Islam and Muslims"".
While Poland's Muslim population is small, Islam has a presence there dating back to at least the Medieval era.
The Lipka Tatars are a Muslim community descended from Mongol conquerors who later served as soldiers for a succession of Polish monarchs.
Though initially thought to have numbered in the tens of thousands, the community now has just over 10,000 members, with just under 2,000 remaining in Poland, due to border changes and assimilation into the wider Polish community.
York University academic Kasia Narkowicz told Al Jazeera that Islamophobia had been brewing in Poland for years, in keeping ""with the broader global trend of anti-Muslim sentiments"".
Kasia Narkowicz, York University
She argued that in that atmosphere the historic contributions made by the Lipkas were largely forgotten.
""When I did research on Islamophobia in Poland in 2011... people spoke about the 1683 Battle of Vienna, which they perceived as a key event where Poles stopped Muslims at the gates of Europe,"" she said.
""Now they are using another battle, the 1571 Battle of Lepanto, as example of Polish resistance to Islam that saved Europe from 'Islamisation'.
""What many ... do not realise is that many of the soldiers fighting for Poland at that time were indeed the Tatars, Poland's Muslim minority.""
Narkowicz was eager to stress that Poland was once home to more Muslims than it was likely to have in the near future.
""Muslims in Poland have practised their religion freely for hundreds of years without any issues ... many Poles who are now worried about a Muslim invasion are completely unaware of [this history].""
For Anna Lachowska, while the rise of Islamophobia in her native land is worrying, it is important to put the trend into perspective.
Now a resident of France, she described how she was asked to remove her headscarf while waiting in line for a travel pass, something she said would not have happened in Poland.
""I am a proud holder of a Polish passport with a hijab photo and it wasn't a problem to make it,"" she said.
""It's not that I am fixated about the scarf, but I cannot agree with the French fixation on this ban.
""Poland is better, more open, more respectful in this matter.""

Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte, this year's Chairman of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), managed to fend off criticism of his ""war on drugs"", which has left thousands of people dead.
""I think Duterte was very smart in using this event to legitimise himself and push back against criticism of his drug war,"" said Richard Heydarian, a geopolitical analyst from De La Salle University in Manila.
""We saw no major country raising the drug war issue or if ever they raised it, it was very low-key.""
But it was tit-for-tat.
Duterte spared his Myanmar counterpart, de facto leader Aung San Suu Kyi, from having to explain or account for the plight of the 600,000 Rohingya who have been forced to flee the country to Bangladesh.
Driven out by violence from state forces, the displaced Rohingya are languishing at refugee camps. United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres has described their situation as ""catastrophic"".
Duterte's spokesman said two of the 10 ASEAN leaders brought up the Rohingya issue at their plenary meeting on Monday, and that Suu Kyi assured the group that the crisis was being addressed.
The spokesman also said that Suu Kyi agreed to accept humanitarian assistance for the Rohingya, which Myanmar had earlier been accused of restricting.
In the penultimate draft of Duterte's ""Chairman’s Statement"" - a document issued by the host leader to sum up the results of the group's discussions - the ASEAN leaders briefly tackled the Rohingya situation as a matter of ""disaster resiliency"".
""We … extended appreciation for the prompt response in the delivery of relief items for the Northern Viet Nam flash floods and landslides victims, the displaced communities in Marawi City, the Philippines, as well as the affected communities in Northern Rakhine State, Myanmar,"" the statement read.
There was no other mention of the issue in the 26-page document, which tackled other regional issues, including North Korea's nuclear weapons programme, tensions in the South China Sea, as well as ""terrorism and extremism"".
Meanwhile, the document contained two paragraphs on the illegal drug problem and how the member countries have worked together in efforts to solve it.
There was, however, no mention of Duterte's campaign against illegal drugs or its victims.
The document's segment on human rights tackled neither the Rohingya crisis nor the drug war.
""It's an absolute travesty,"" Heydarian said of the group's silence on the Rohingya.
""I think this is the worst thing that could happen to ASEAN because next to Syria, the Rohingya crisis is the biggest humanitarian crisis that we're facing right now in the 21st century.""
Duterte's determination to protect his drug war from scrutiny and criticism has left ASEAN unable to speak on human rights at all, added Heydarian.
In a media conference to cap off his chairmanship, Duterte blasted Canada Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, one of several world leaders who had bilateral meetings with ASEAN, for bringing up ""human rights, extra-judicial killings and rule of law"" in his one-on-one with Duterte - even if Trudeau said Duterte was ""receptive"" and ""very cordial"" about it.
""It is a personal and official insult. That is why you hear me cursing,"" Duterte said. ""It angers me. When you are a foreigner, you do not know exactly what is happening to this country.""
This kind of talk leaves it impossible for any leader to put a counterpart to task over human rights issues, said Heydarian.
""If the chairman of the ASEAN, which is the Philippines, is saying you are to have no say on what's happening with our human rights issues; when you're telling the world, 'It's none of your business how we conduct our drug war'; what is the moral ascendancy of the ASEAN as a whole to tell Myanmar to treat its people better?""
A statement released in September by ASEAN foreign ministers on the ""humanitarian situation in Rakhine State"" foreshadowed the leaders' silence on the matter.
The statement, issued by Philippines Foreign Affairs Secretary Alan Peter Cayetano on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in New York, condemned the attacks on Myanmar security forces that triggered the latest spate of violence in Rakhine - but not the ensuing destruction of entire Rohingya communities that forced them to flee en masse.
Malaysia, an ASEAN member, disagreed with Cayetano's document and disowned it, saying it was not based on ""consensus"", a key ASEAN principle.
Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam, which comprise ASEAN, have agreed never to say or do anything unless they are in ""consensus"", as well as to never interfere in one another's domestic affairs.
Heydarian said ASEAN's insistence on ""consensus"" and ""non-interference"" has constrained the group from directly addressing crucial matters, settling instead for polite but impotent rhetoric.

Myanmar's army released a report late on Monday that found ""no deaths of innocent people"" after deadly attacks by Rohingya rebels on several police posts in northern Rakhine state on August 25 sparked a brutal military campaign.
The army said 376 ""terrorists"" were killed in fighting after the August attacks. The crackdown led to the mass exodus of about 600,000 Rohingya civilians who fled the predominantly Buddhist country into neighbouring Bangladesh.
Many survivors in squalid camps inside Bangladesh - described as the world's worst refugee crisis - have reported mass killings, torture, and rape against Rohingya children, women, and men.
""The Burmese military's absurd effort to absolve itself of mass atrocities underscores why an independent international investigation is needed to establish the facts and identify those responsible,"" said Human Rights Watch's Brad Adams in a statement on Tuesday.
""The Burmese authorities have once again shown that they can't and won't credibly investigate themselves.""
The United Nations has called the majority-Muslim Rohingya in Myanmar the world's most persecuted minority.
Jeremy Laurence, a UN spokesman, told a news conference on Tuesday their investigators in Bangladesh found ample evidence of the killing and torture of civilians in Myanmar.
""Our findings are quite clear on what is happening,"" Laurence said. ""What we found took place in Rakhine state… is a textbook example of ethnic cleansing, murder, rape, assault, killings, torture. We heard [this] from people… over and over again.""
Human Rights Watch said it is time for the International Criminal Court in The Hague to investigate Myanmar's authorities.
""The military's grave crimes committed with impunity are exactly what the International Criminal Court was created for,"" Adams said.
The Myanmar military's report and its denunciation by Human Rights Watch came as US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson arrives in Myanmar on Wednesday.
Demands have been growing in the United States for Washington to impose economic and travel sanctions against the military and entities under its control over the Rohingya crisis.
US President Donald Trump said on Tuesday he backed the ""safe and voluntary return"" of the refugees.
""The United States supports efforts to end the violence, to ensure accountability for atrocities committed,"" a White House statement quoted the president as saying. ""We welcome the commitments by the government of Myanmar and we are ready to support the implementation of the Rakhine recommendations.""

Islamic community comprises just 0.2 percent of population
Hate crimes have risen amid Islamophobia as Muslims quit country
Prague, Czech Republic - Walking along the idyllic streets of Prague just blocks away from the famed Wenceslas Square, 38-year-old Palestinian-born Raed Shaikh stopped to point out a halal grocery store he and the handful of other Muslim residents in town frequent.
He then motioned towards a Middle Eastern restaurant to the right, hidden behind a small mosque.
""Here is the highest concentration of Muslims in Prague,"" the IT project manager said laughingly.
Though no exact figures exist, the Muslim community in the Czech Republic is small, between 5,000 and 20,000, or less than 0.02 percent of the total population.
Just a portion lives in Prague.
Yet Islam has become a hot-button topic in Czech national politics, where the power to resolve the country's hung parliament could lie with a politician whose only policy is, ""No to Islam. No to terrorism"".
Czech-Japanese entrepreneur Tomio Okamura and his Freedom and Direct Democracy Party (SPD) rode into parliament as the third most powerful party after the recent October nationwide elections, with no discernible policy other than to drive Islam completely out of the Czech Republic.
The campaign slogan was convincing enough for the newly formed SPD to scoop significant votes in its first ever electoral race.
Having built ties to other far-right movements in Europe, such as Marine Le Pen's National Front in France, Okamura hopes to achieve his goal through ongoing coalition talks with controversial billionaire Andrej Babis, who is slated to become the country's next prime minister.
Babis' Action of Dissatisfied Citizens Party (ANO) won the October elections in decisive fashion but did not secure a simple majority. Now he must form a coalition with a fragmented parliament that has expressed little willingness to work with the populist agro-magnate who at the time of the elections was being investigated for fraud.
Some Muslims in Prague fear that the circumstances may lead to an alliance with Okamura, giving him an unprecedented platform - a worrying prospect given ANO and SPD's common disdain for Muslim refugees.
""We have to fight for what our ancestors built here. If there will be more Muslims than Belgians in Brussels, that's their problem. I don't want that here. They won't be telling us who should live here,"" Babis told journalists in June.
This type of increasingly hostile rhetoric against migrants has profoundly stoked Islamophobia. For the members of Prague's small Muslim community, it is a sign of worrying times ahead.
Vladimir Sanka, board member of Muslim Community in Prague association
""Many of our friends have already left, and if [Islamophobia] was not the first reason, it would certainly be the second,"" the Palestinian-born Shaikh said.
Currently, Islam is recognised as a religion in the Czech Republic, but its followers are restricted from several basic privileges enjoyed by other faiths, including the right to establish schools, to hold legally recognised weddings and conduct religious ceremonies in public spaces.
""Most of the Muslims here are doctors, engineers and IT specialists and so on, yet some [political] parties…are trying to change our rights and eliminate Islam,"" said Vladimir Sanka, a 58-year-old Czech Muslim, who is on the board of the Muslim Community in Prague association.
With negotiations between the two parties ongoing, Okamura has already told local media that ANO has pledged to consider a restriction on asylum for Muslims and a ban on ""Sharia"", or Islamic law, and that SPD will not support Babis unless an agreement is reached.
Lubomir Kopecek, a political analyst at Masaryk University in Brno, said that an alliance at this stage is unlikely, though, by no means unfeasible.
""If an ANO and Okamura government would happen in the next weeks or months, it could change many things,"" he said, referring to religious freedoms.
Even if the two parties did align, they would have a hard time carrying out such a ban, the chief of the Constitutional Court, Pavel Rychetsky, told local media saying: ""Nobody can forbid freedom of religion and belief.""
Still, the move would not be unprecedented for the region.
Slovakia last year passed a law effectively banning Islam from gaining official status as a religion.
Making matters worse, growing anti-Islam sentiment has resulted in an uptick in hate speech and even physical attacks against Muslims who moved here long before the refugee crisis.
In July, local media reported two Muslim women were escorting a group of children to an aquapark in Prague when a third woman began verbally and physically assaulting them.
One of the victims was Shaikh's wife.
""It is becoming more and more tough here, unfortunately,"" he said.
Shaikh, who twice debated the issue with Okamura on Czech television in 2015, said it has become difficult for his community to find a place in Prague to gather for Eid al-Fitr - the celebration at the end of Ramadan - in recent years.
Large halls want nothing to do with Muslims.
""It wasn't a problem for 23 years, but a couple of years ago it became mission impossible,"" said Shaikh.
Like its eastern neighbours, Poland and Hungary, the Czech Republic's attitude towards migrants soured in 2015 after an escalation of attacks in Western Europe and as the refugee crisis continued to unfold.
Despite a very small number of Muslims and never having fallen victim to attack, the perceived threat of attacks paired with a tradition of nativism - for example, the longstanding persecution of the ethnic Romani - has made the country susceptible to populism and far-right attitudes.
According to a Harvard University survey published earlier in 2017, of the hundreds of thousands of people in Europe, Czechs exhibited a higher level of implicit racial bias than in any other European country.
In Prague, politicians including President Milos Zeman have sought advantage by adopting tough positions on Muslims, standing in fierce opposition to EU refugee quotas, taking just 12 of nearly 2,700 refugees allotted by the European Commission.
The stance has led to inflammatory rhetoric, with Zeman remarking that Muslim integration in Czech society is ""practically impossible"".
The anti-Islamic group known as Block Against Islam gather at the Saudi Embassy in Prague to mock the Hajj pilgrimage in September 2016 [Philip Heijmans/Al Jazeera]
Such rhetoric has paved the way for anti-Islam groups like Block Against Islam, which is known for staging outlandish events that last year included dressing up in traditional Muslim garb and mocking the Hajj pilgrimage by marching around a portable toilet meant to resemble the Holy Kaaba at Mecca.
In a separate event, the group staged a fake Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL, also known as ISIS) invasion at Old Town Square that included a mock beheading.
""They are a small group, but they want to provoke a reaction and hope that we react so that they can say they told us so,"" Sanka said.
Exacerbating the issue, the Czech Republic has fallen victim to a destabilising disinformation campaign - widely believed to be perpetrated by the Kremlin - that hopes to see Czechs turn against western-backed democratic politics in favour of illiberal autocrats.
In order to do that, dozens of fake news organisations established in recent years have focused on creating a false narrative against Muslims with the goal of herding the populace towards populists.
HateFree, an anti-discrimination organisation run by the government has debunked approximately 100 anti-Muslim hoax stories in the Czech Republic over the past few years.
""We don't have the capacity to do much here, but we are still in a very tough position,"" Shaikh said of his small community.
""On every corner, on every TV and newspaper, you can see their stance and the fear, so it is no wonder why people are scared.""

Army spokesman Lul Ruai Koang said in a statement the army pulled back its troops late on Saturday after General Paul Malong agreed to reduce the number of his bodyguards.
Malong’s wife Lucy Ayak told Reuters by phone from Nairobi that her husband remains under house arrest but said the troop withdrawal is a ""sign of peace."" Ayak could not confirm if the reduction of bodyguards took place.
Malong led the army’s war effort against rebels from 2014, but was sacked and placed under house arrest this May after a fall-out with President Salva Kiir.
Last weekend, Kiir sent troops to disarm Malong’s bodyguards, but they refused. Kiir’s troops surrounded the house.
Malong is under US sanctions and has been accused, along with Kiir, by a UN experts panel of leading troops who murdered and raped civilians during the civil war.
South Sudan’s war began in 2013 between Kiir, an ethnic Dinka, and his former Vice President Riek Machar, a Nuer.
Tens of thousands have been killed, and the war has created Africa’s largest refugee crisis in two decades. The UN said the conflict’s ethnic cleansing was setting the stage for genocide.
Malong is also Dinka, and the standoff with Kiir raised fears of fighting within the ethnic group, which is South Sudan’s largest and comprises the bulk of the army and the government’s ruling coalition.
One commander loyal to Malong joined Machar’s rebels with dozens of armed troops during the standoff. Dinka leaders from around the nation convened to negotiate a solution.
Earlier in the week, Malong requested the UN mission in South Sudan to intervene and give him protection. Malong’s troops have been accused of attacking UN installations and killing peacekeepers. The UN did not respond to the request.

The rally, which began at 3pm (14:00 GMT) local time, coincides with Poland's independence day on November 11.
According to the organisers, the event is the biggest ""patriotic"" gathering of its kind in Europe.
""We expect something like 100,000 people to attend this year,"" said Al Jazeera's David Chater, reporting from Warsaw.
Organisers later claimed the number had exceeded that estimate.
Some of the chants early on in the day included: ""Great national Poland, religion is the basis of the Polish nation, Great Catholic Poland and one nation across the borders"".
Later chants directed expletives at refugees, leftists, liberal media outlers, and the US.
A countermarch organised by Antifa Warsaw drew around 5,000 participants, according to lidia Domanska, one of those involved.
She said it was the biggest anti-fascist demonstration on the Independence Day in recent years and had passed without incident.
Having launched as a smaller gathering in 2009, it now draws tens of thousands of supporters, including many from neighbouring countries.
Since 2012, a group of sympathisers known as the march guard was recruited to provide security.
Many of the attendees are young nationalists, who protest against Islam and the EU.
The rally's popularity demonstrates the deepening divisions within the Poland's divided society.
Agata Szczesniak, a member of the independent investigative journalist unit Oko Press, told Al Jazeera: ""These people are angry, they are frustrated they are blaming Muslims which are not present in Poland almost at all.
""They are also blaming liberal European elites for the failures of the state.
""They are strongly anti-refugee and anti-immigrant, and strongly nationalist.""
Angelika, a 21-year-old at the march, told Al Jazeera: ""To me, November 11 is the most important day in the calendar. On this day, Poland regained independence.
""If not for the fight and persistence of our people, we wouldn't be here today. In the memory of those who fought for our country, I participate in the march each year.""
Alexandra, a 30-year-old in Warsaw, said she was worried about the increase in the number of young people attending far-right events.
""I'm saddened by the fact that in recent years Independence Day has become an occasion for violent clashes and the promotion of far-right views,"" she told Al Jazeera.
""What is also worrying is that in comparison to previous years, I can see a lot of very young people, who are a fertile ground for the easy solutions offered by the nationalists,"" she added.
The slogan ""We Want God"" aims to remind that Poland is still the bastion of faith and religiosity in Europe, organisers have claimed.
The chairman of the Independence March association, Robert Bakiewicz, said during a recent press conference that the protesters want to confront atheist Europe and respond to the ""invasion of immigrants"".
""We are recalling the fighting church, which for centuries was the keystone and fundament of Europe"", he said. ""We want to show Catholicism not as a faith of weakness, but as a faith of strong people"".
Beata Szydlo, current prime minister, leads the right-wing populist Law and Justice party. On Thursday, she told a conference in Warsaw that Poland was ""in favour of an EU where Christian traditions are not censorship"".
Poland has refused to take in refugees, with officials claiming that people of Muslim background are a threat to security. Fewer than one percent of the Polish population is Muslim.
The Independence March often ends in clashes between protesters and police, but the level of violence has fallen over the past two years, perhaps as a result of the Law and Justice's election victory.
In a statement on its website, organsiers said protesters were banned from marching under the influence of alcohol as they warned people to ""behave appropriately"".

Elsewhere, on Friday, the far-right All-Polish Youth and National Radical Camp groups held a conference focusing on ""the vision after the collapse of the West, that is, the old world in the post-European Union era ... social and economic changes and the shock of the future"".
Richard Spencer, a well-known American white supremacist, had been slated to attend but was removed from the agenda.
It was unclear whether the Polish government blocked his attendance, but Foreign Minister Witold Waszczykowski warned on Friday that the self-described ""white Zionist"" should not appear publicly in the Eastern European country, especially given his views on the Holocaust. Spencer has previously been accused of anti-Semitism.

Poles Apart: Is Poland's democracy under threat?

https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/11/60000-nationalists-fascists-joined-warsaw-march-171112140646393.html,refugee,1144,Sun Nov 12 2017 15:49:25 GMT+0000,Agnieszka Pikulicka-Wilczewska,"Why 60,000 people joined a nationalist march in Poland","Warsaw, Poland - After some 60,000 people, including nationalists and fascists, gathered in the Polish capital for an ""Independence March"" on Saturday, the country's deep divisions have risen to the fore.
This year's event ran under the slogan: ""We want God"".
Typical chants included: ""The whole Poland sings with us: f*** off with the refugees"", ""God, honour, homeland"", ""Not red, not rainbow but national Poland"", ""One nation across the borders"" and ""F*** Antifa"".
Some reports said that amid the sea of banners, messages included: ""Clean Blood"" and ""Europe Will Be White"".
Poland has refused to take in refugees, with officials claiming that people of Muslim background are a threat to security. Fewer than one percent of the Polish population is Muslim.
The event, also attended by citizens of neighbouring countries, sent the world a clear anti-European Union, anti-liberal and anti-Islam message, although many participants - including organisers - claimed that the march was peaceful and patriotic.
""Cheers to Great Poland!"" a man chanted from the stage to crowds waving white and red flags. ""The world is changing. We are fighting a culture war.
""This war is not somewhere far away. It is in your home even though you may not realise it. It's a war against God, against the homeland and honour, which they want to take away from us.""
Crowds applauded in agreement, cheering, ""Great Catholic Poland, Great national Poland"".
Some fired off red flares.
The mood was celebratory which together with the red gleam and dark blue sky gave the moment an ominous atmosphere.
When the emcee announced the national anthem, families with children, elderly, women, and above all young men, stood at attention and sang along.
Each year, the November 11 Warsaw Independence March gathers thousands of participants commemorating the memory of 1918, when Poland regained statehood after 123 years of partitions.
But it has also become an occasion for right-wing groups to promote their ideology.
""Europe and the world is in decay: culturally, politically, economically. We Poles have to be the alternative,"" said Tomasz Dorosz of the National-Radical Camp, speaking on stage. ""There will be a national Poland or none.""
""Today, we are reclaiming the revolution from our enemies. Today, we are the revolution. We will carry this banner,"" said Dorosz's associate. ""When we march together with God we are undefeatable.""
Parallel to the march, the Anti-Fascist Coalition, an umbrella alliance of the Warsaw Women Strike, Citizens RP and other progressive groups organised a demonstration under the slogan: ""To your freedom and ours"".
Lidia Domanska from Antifascist Warsaw said around 5,000 people joined the counterprotest.
While both events passed without major incident, tension is not far from Poland's polarised society.
With public discourse shifting right, divisive language and nationalist slogans could cause further turmoil.
Lidia Domasska, Antifascist Warsaw
Recent international and domestic developments have deepened divisions.
Domanska told Al Jazeera that following the 2015 parliamentary elections, which brought to power the right-wing Law and Justice party, ""fascists have put on suits and entered the [the lower chamber of the parliament]"".
""The media is filled with right-wing propaganda; the discourse has shifted towards views which only a few years back would have been unequivocally labelled as fascist and racist,"" she said.
""People who are fed with this narrative begin to see hate speech as something acceptable.""
The year 2015, which saw the refugee crisis further unravel as attacks took place in Paris, was a turning point for the European far right and brought several traditionally nationalist and right-wing messages to Eastern Europe's mainstream politics.
It is now commonplace to juxtapose Christian values, sovereignty of the nation-state and the right to protect the national character of societies against what the far right views as Brussels seeking to erase nation states and ""Islamisize"" Eastern Europe's homogenous societies.
""Poland is the role model for Europe,"" said a representative of the Slovakian far right on stage on Saturday. ""It's time for the European nationalists to unite in the fight against neo-Marxists and Islamists.""
Meanwhile, the right-wing Polish government's reluctance to accept refugees and its opposition to the EU's refugee resettlement programme has seen its popularity rise among the far right.
""The threat comes from Brussels, which aims to create the United States of Europe. We will not let them do that,"" said Laszlo Toroczka from Hungary's Jobbik party, who spoke at Saturday's event. ""Poles and Hungarians are capable of changing Europe. I believe that with God's help we will win"".
Despite the explicitly nationalist character of rhetoric that seeped through the march, right-wing social media users warned against labelling it as fascist and nationalist.
The event, they say, was an expression of Polish patriotism attended by families with children, rather than angry mobs of young white men.
According to a study by the Public Opinion Research Centre (CBOS) published in November 2016, while 17 percent of Poles express support for movements such as National Radical Camp (ONR) and All-Polish Youth (Mlodziez Wszechpolska), only seven percent identify as nationalists.
At the same time, 88 percent of Poles consider themselves patriots, even though for 52 percent, the difference between nationalism and patriotism is unclear.
At the same time, sentiments of nationalist movements resonate most with people younger than 25, 38 percent of whom support those groups.
In August 2017, CBOS found that in 2015, 32 percent of young people identified with right-wing views - above the record-high of 1998.
However, that trend was temporary and in the first seven months of 2017, 26 percent of young people between the ages of 18 and 24 expressed such views.
The support for the far right has not corresponded with the rise of religiosity among Poles, which, according to CBOS is decreasing.
The reference to religion in this year's Independence March slogan - We Want God - may, therefore, come as a surprise.
""Religion is, above all, a rhetorical tool that the far right uses to present itself as the defender of traditional values against liberal progressives and other 'sinners',"" Andrea Pirro, research fellow at Scuola Normale Superiore, told Al Jazeera.
""Such a narrative is intended to reinforce the contraposition between a Christian 'us' (the native population) and a non-Christian 'them' (by exclusion, the non-native 'aliens').
""Religion can be thus interpreted as a political expedient to be used against migrant populations, ethnic minorities, and 'liberal agents' supposedly acting on their behalf.""
Professor Anna Grzymala-Busse of Stanford University said Poland's use of religious nationalism and the fusion of religious and national identities is nothing new.
""We see similar versions in other countries in central and Eastern Europe [such as] the Serbian government during the wars of Yugoslav Succession [and] Jobbik's references to the crown of St. Stephen in Hungary,"" she said. ""All of these are instrumental uses of religion for the sake of political ends, and rarely reflect genuine religious sentiment.""

https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/11/man-buried-somaliland-dead-171112142346344.html,refugee,2280,Sun Nov 12 2017 18:46:25 GMT+0000,Matthew Vickery,The man who buried Somaliland's dead,"It was June 2, 1988, and Hargeisa was under attack. The rat-a-tat-tat of nearby artillery rose above the city and filled Ibrahim Abdullahi's ears, but the battle was in the north and hadn't reached his government-controlled southern district - at least not yet.
As he nervously ventured outside, Abdullahi's mind raced. He had already sent his wife and eight children to safety in Ethiopia, but he felt a longing to stay in Hargeisa, a need to protect his modest mud-brick home and keep it occupied to deter looters and to defend the product of years of his hard work.
Everything had happened so quickly.
Just days before, Somali National Movement (SNM) rebels had captured nearby Burao city from Somalia's national army, and Hargeisa was now in their sights. But it seemed that government soldiers were determined to stop that at any cost.
Within the past two days, Abdullahi had heard that killings had begun.
""I'll take it day by day,"" Abdullahi thought to himself. ""If the situation gets worse and there's an opportunity to run - then I'll go.""
Government soldiers were rounding up men of fighting age in Hargeisa to prevent them from joining the SNM.
Crouched down outside his home, Abdullahi's mind wandered to thoughts of fleeing again.
Rumours were circulating that women and children were also being targeted, but he had no way to know for sure. Some people had even said government bombers were pursuing fleeing families as they tried to escape.
He thought of his wife and kids and prayed the rumours were untrue.
Then, out of nowhere, he heard his name.
""Ibrahim Abdullahi?!""
The noise of gunfire hung in the air, but it remained at least a couple of kilometres away. But here, as he looked up, tens of metres from him, was a small group of government soldiers.
Abdullahi's mind raced again. Civilian or not, he was of fighting age.
""Yes, that's me,"" he murmured, trying not to let the fear in his head spill into his words.
""Come!"" the commander barked, several soldiers standing menacingly beside him, guns cocked and ready. ""We need you.""
Walking towards what he assumed was certain death, Abdullahi took one deep breath and ventured forward.
Using an intricately carved wooden cane to help his ageing legs, 75-year-old Abdullahi stands tall and proud, albeit a little unsteady before lowering himself into a black leather swivel chair in the unassuming office building in Hargeisa.
It's 2017, and the walls of the office are dotted with photos of men in masks working meticulously, digging at the dusty ground and carefully brushing away dirt from skeletons that haven't seen the light of day in decades.
""I remember burying bodies in that grave,"" Abdullahi says gesturing towards one of the photos on the wall in front of him, ""and that one"", he adds, his eyes slowly tracing the room.
""Some days I must have buried hundreds, some days just dozens,"" he continues. ""People were being killed everywhere in the town. They didn't see a difference between men, women, or children - everybody was to be killed.""
Abdullahi's story precedes the man in Hargeisa, the capital of the self-declared republic of Somaliland that announced its separation from Somalia after the government of Siad Barre collapsed in 1991.
His weathered face - one that seems to have as many wrinkles as years he's had in his life - may not be well-known in the city, but in every corner of the capital his story is legendary, some regarding it as truth, others as myth.
But in the office of the War Crimes Commissioner, Abdullahi's story has been confirmed again and again - over the years, he's been the key to reuniting distraught families with the remains of their loved ones.
""Those were black days, black black days,"" Abdullahi repeats as he recalls memories that have stayed fresh in his mind three decades later.
Resting his cane on the table in front of him, Abdullahi begins to tell his story, his eyes darting from side to side as his mind rewinds through the years to 1988 and the 28 days of his life that have defined him ever since.
The city was a ghost town. Buildings lay abandoned, dead bodies were scattered in the streets, and the smell of death lingered in the air.
As Abdullahi walked, everything started to become familiar. He wasn't walking to a military barracks like he first thought; he was on his way to the Ministry of Public Services where he was employed handling heavy machinery like tractors and diggers.
""Go and get one of the machines that can dig,"" the commander said abruptly when they arrived outside the complex. ""Be quick, we have to go - there are bodies waiting.""
Abdullahi did as he was told.
Within an hour he was at Malko Durduro, a valley area in western Hargeisa, digging into the soft soil. Several government soldiers stood around his digger with 10 bodies tied together lying beside them, blood still seeping through clothes and staining the sandy earth below them.
As he listened to the soldiers speaking among themselves it became apparent to Abdullahi that the army didn't want the bodies buried in an effort to cover their crimes - they were fed up with the smell. His job, as their new prisoner, was to get rid of it.
The corpses were unrecognisable. Pieces of flesh ripped off their bodies from head to toe, shot to pieces by an anti-aircraft gun that sat nearby.
""If I didn't know how to operate this equipment they would kill me, I would be lying there as well,"" Abdullahi realised as he dug. ""There's no one else in the town; I'm only alive because they need me to do this job.""
To survive, he would have to dig.
Guarded day and night, Abdullahi dug to save his life. Barely allowed time to rest, he buried hundreds of bodies a day in that first week.
At first, the dead were men, mostly in fatigues - rebels. After a few days, the fatigues disappeared, and women started appearing, then children. All killed in the same way - tied together in groups of 10, shot, their faces sometimes slashed with knifes and mutilated.
The soldiers may maim and deface them; they may chuck the bodies on the ground like pieces of rotten meat as though they were never humans with emotions, dreams, wants and desires - but he knew otherwise. They were fathers and sons, mothers and daughters, and even in death, they deserved respect.
In those first few days, Abdullahi swore to himself that he would at least give them that.
The most important thing to him was to get everyone buried before nightfall, before wild animals would come out of the bush and claw away at the bodies. If he could just do that, he thought, it would be some way at least to give the dead some dignity after such a violent and unjust end. It was how he could show respect, his silent rebellion against his captors.
For days on end, he worked from dawn till dusk, burying the war crimes of a regime that wanted him and his people dead. He did what he could to keep his mind blank. He thought of his family and daydreamed about where they could be, safe and away from the living hell that their hometown had become.
He trained himself to concentrate on digging, to distance himself from what was happening. That's the only way he would survive.
Then, after two weeks, one of the bodies spoke.
The ground slips a little below Abdullahi's feet after a night of heavy rain turned the bone-dry dirt in Malko Durduro to mud.
""It's important we teach what happened in the past so it never happens again,"" Abdullahi says using his cane to steady himself as Al Jazeera takes the 75-year-old back to the mass graves he dug three decades ago at the notorious execution site of Malko Durduro.
""My biggest fear is that what happened here will be forgotten.""
Plagued by a deadly and devastating drought all year, the night's rain was the proverbial drop in the ocean, bringing more joy to the residents of the Somali city than water. But it was still something to a region that has been battling extreme weather conditions throughout 2017.
""Every year when there's heavy rain more skeletons appear,"" Abdullahi says, scanning every inch of the area as he meanders from side to side. ""It brings all the memories flooding back.""
To Abdullahi's left, imposing cliffs of dirt stretch several metres up, small trees and cacti clinging onto the edge - just another rainy night away from succumbing to erosion and joining Abdullahi on the valley floor.
Returning to Malko Durduro three decades after he was forced to bury thousands of bodies here, it doesn't take long before Abdullahi's mind takes him back to those dark days.
""I still can't sleep at night remembering him,"" Abdullahi says, recalling the one body - the only body - which looked up to him from among the dead and spoke.
It was two weeks into his captivity when Abdullahi came across a miracle.
A man who had somehow survived the firing squad and then played dead as soldiers piled the executed into a grave.
The miracle was short lived.
Facing being buried alive, there was only one thing the survivor could do. He spoke.
""He was supposed to be dead,"" Abdullahi says pausing. ""He talked to me, pleaded with me, 'please untie me', but the soldiers heard him speaking. They untied him from the corpses, forced him to stand up, and they shot everywhere at him, all around him, even at the trees.""
""I had to do this job to survive,"" he adds, looking for understanding.
Digging his cane into the soft ground, Abdullahi walks the valley floor for several minutes, his eyes wandering the surroundings as his memories take him back to that time. He can't prevent them, even if he wanted to.
Stopping in his tracks and using the cane as an extension of himself, Abdullahi motions towards the cliff side. Within seconds, and without words, it's clear what he's trying to draw attention to. Exposed by the rain and protruding from the wet cliffside is the unmistakable bone-white colour of a skull, almost waiting for the right moment to drop to the ground and join its burier on the floor below.
To the right of the skull, the tips of ribs stick out at differing angles sandwiched between greenish brown fabrics - fatigues.
""He was a rebel,"" Abdullahi says, filling the silence. ""I remember burying there.""
Panning the area, just tens of metres away from the newly exposed skeleton more bones stick out - this time there are no fatigues. The bones of a civilian killed by the army, and then buried by Abdullahi.
""I remember being taken to this valley and a military vehicle pulled up with an official inside it,"" he recalls.
""They pushed 12 bodies out of it, bodies of school children - they were still in their shirts and dresses. They had no noticeable gunshot wounds. A soldier told me all of their blood had been drained from them so it could be used for the national army. That soldier cried as he told me, he cried for almost five minutes.""
""Those were the worst days of my life.""
As he speaks, the faint sound of playing children carries through the air from a school less than 100 meters away. Throughout the land surrounding the school, more bodies are scattered, waiting to be exposed, identified by forensics, and eventually returned to their waiting families decades later.
For Abdullahi, the memories of the people he buried will never leave him. But he counts himself lucky he survived.
As the bodies reduced from hundreds a day at the beginning of Abdullahi's captivity, to just a few per day after three weeks, he knew his time was running out. Soon he would be surplus to requirements, and if he didn't find a way to escape, he would be killed too.
But on the 28th day - for the very first time - he found himself alone.
Abdullahi didn't need a second opportunity.
""The guards were getting more relaxed with me as I hadn't tried to escape, but on the 28th day I was out in the valley and realised there was no one watching me - I ran,"" he says, describing his bid for freedom.
Hiding until nightfall, Abdullahi smuggled himself out of Hargeisa. Within days, he had gathered information about the whereabouts of his wife and kids - they had survived the bombers and were still alive.
After two days and three nights of walking, he made it to their refugee camp in Ethiopia.
Walking into the camp on the morning of the third day, Abdullahi saw his family in the distance, and for the briefest of moments, the memories of the dead left him.
""At that moment, when I saw them again - I felt reborn.""
The 75-year-old says he's lived a good life as a husband and a father to twelve children - he had four more after returning to Hargeisa after the war.
He's come to terms with what he witnessed and became a part all those years ago, and has found some comfort in helping the Somaliland authorities to recover the dead - 2,000 of whom remain buried.
""My children, to this day, call me 'the walking dead' when they see me,"" he says, laughing a little to himself. ""They couldn't believe I survived. They still can't.""

Hundreds of men have barricaded themselves in the Manus Island centre for more than 11 days without regular food or water, defying closure bids by Australia and Papua New Guinea in what the United Nations calls a ""looming humanitarian crisis"".
Rejecting UN calls to restore utilities to the camp, Papua New Guinea said this week it would ""apprehend"" those responsible for the standoff when it forcibly evicted the men on Saturday.
But several asylum seekers said Papua New Guinea officials told them detainees could remain until Sunday.
""Police are talking on a microphone outside prison,"" Behrouz Boochani, a Kurdish journalist from Iran who has spent more than four years held in the camp, told Reuters.
""They're telling the refugees to leave, saying tomorrow will be the last day you are here,"" he said in a text message.
It was not immediately clear what caused the postponement.
Pressure on the asylum seekers, drawn largely from Afghanistan, Iran, Myanmar, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and Syria, has grown in recent days as Papua New Guinea tries to get them to move to three transit centres.
The asylum seekers fear reprisals if they move to the transit centres, pending possible resettlement in the United States. The main camp was closed on October 31 and water and power have been cut off.
Some island dwellers are angry at what they perceive as preferential treatment for the asylum seekers, many of them well educated, in a poor, rural society, and some detainees have come under attack when on release from the camp.
The patience of Papua New Guinea authorities has begun to wane, however, and they moved this week to remove camp fences and dismantle rainwater collection bins, as well as makeshift shelters built to ward off the tropical sun and rain.
Under pressure, groups of men have elected to move to the transit centres. But the exact number left is difficult to ascertain, though Manus Island police commander David Yapu told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation that about 400 remain.
Several of those remaining told Reuters they would not move, setting the scene for a potential clash, which would further stoke international criticism of Australia.
Australia has used the centre, and a camp on the tiny Pacific island of Nauru, to detain asylum seekers who try to reach its shores by boat. It says boat arrivals will never enter Australia, even if found to be refugees, as this would encourage people smugglers in Asia.
Acting Prime Minister Julie Bishop said there was no reason for the remaining men to choose to stay, rejecting criticism of inadequate facilities at the transit centres.
""Over the last few months they have travelled to East Lorengau on many occasions and never raised any concerns,"" Bishop told reporters in Perth.

Doctors in the capital told Al Jazeera pharmacies across Sanaa that were already struggling with a critical shortage of specialist drugs, would be unable to treat cancer, diabetes and renal failure patients by the start of next week.
""We're running dangerously low on medical supplies and won't have anywhere near the necessary vials of pain-relief medication, insulin, and other specialist medicines for our patients,"" said Abdulrahman al-Ansi, a doctor at Sanaa's al-Mutawkil hospital.
Ali, a two-year-old boy with acute lymphocytic leukaemia died last month as a direct result of the absence of cancer medications, he said.
""Unless Saudi Arabia eases its restrictions and allows food and medical supplies, I could end up losing all of my cancer patients - even those suffering from diabetes - [a treatable disease] will die. Hundreds will perish in the next week alone.""
Saudi Arabia, which has been at war with Yemen since 2015, tightened its air, land and sea blockade of the country on Sunday, after Houthi rebels fired a ballistic missile towards the Saudi capital, Riyadh.
The Houthis, a group of fighters that controls the capital and large expanses of the country, justified the missile attack, blaming Saudi-led air strikes - which have killed thousands of people - of ravaging large parts of north Yemen.
The kingdom has defended the blockade, which bars aid groups like Doctors without Borders, Oxfam and UN agencies from delivering aid, claiming it is aimed at preventing weapons being smuggled into Yemen by its regional rival, Iran.
Tehran has rejected allegations of arming the Houthis, calling them ""malicious, irresponsible, destructive and provocative"".
Mohamed Aboubakr, 62-year-old chemotherapy patient
Aid organisations in Yemen said they were ""greatly alarmed"" by Saudi Arabia's decision, warning it could ""bring millions of people closer to starvation and death"".
""The current stock of vaccines in the country will only last one month. If it is not replenished, outbreaks of communicable diseases, such as polio and measles, are to be expected with fatal consequences, particularly for children under five years of age and those already suffering from malnutrition,"" said Oxfam, Save the Children, the Norwegian Refugee Council and 19 other aid groups in a joint statement.
The 22 humanitarian groups also warned Yemen had only six weeks of food aid remaining for about seven million Yemenis who are facing ""famine-like conditions"".
""The humanitarian situation in Yemen is extremely fragile and any disruption in the pipeline of critical supplies such as food, fuel and medicines has the potential to bring millions of people closer to starvation and death,"" they added.
Since the start of Sunday's siege, the country's already inflated food and fuel prices have skyrocketed, while flights delivering much-needed humanitarian aid have been prevented from landing.
""I haven't received my salary in months,"" Mohamed Aboubakr, a 62-year-old civil servant, who was undergoing chemotherapy at the hospital, told Al Jazeera.
""How am I going to pay my medical bills?"" he asked. ""Prices have soared since the start of the siege - what am I supposed to do?""
Aboubakr said he had borrowed more than $2,000 from friends and family to pay for the treatment, but with the tightening of the siege, suggested it could have all been in vain.
""The Saudis have taken a page from [Syrian President Bashar] al-Assad's playbook. They think this siege will break us and we'll accept their plan for the country. I may not live to see the end of this war, but I pray the Saudis lose.""
The streets of Sanaa were almost free of cars on Thursday due to a fuel shortage, with locals saying public transport fares have doubled.
Azzubair Abdullah Hasan, a medic at a cholera centre in Sanaa's Aljiraf neighbourhood, said even wealthy Yemenis were beginning to feel the pinch.
""Everything has gone up in price,"" Hasan told Al Jazeera.
""Cooking gas has spiked and filling up my car with petrol now costs YR10,000 ($38) [it cost YR6,000 before the start of the siege], how can people continue with their lives. The situation is unbearable.""
Saudi Arabia entered the conflict in Yemen in 2015 after the Houthi rebels took over the capital, Sanaa, and forced Yemeni President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi to flee.
Together with a coalition of other Arab states, and with logistical support from the United States and other western powers, Saudi Arabia has pushed the Houthis from the southern port city of Aden, but has failed to dislodge them from Sanaa and their northern strongholds.
According to the UN, the conflict has killed more than 10,000 people and left over seven million in need of food assistance.
Millions of others do not have adequate access to health, water and sanitation services.
The country has also been hit by a cholera outbreak, with some 900,000 suspected cases since April.

During the day, she and her husband are busy caring for their 10 daughters and two sons inside Khanke camp for displaced Iraqis, located in the country's north. It is at night that the memories come.
""I stay awake just thinking, and I'm so angry I can't sleep,"" Wahda, 41, told Al Jazeera. ""I want to take revenge for my daughters.""
Her family, who are Yazidi, lived until 2014 in Sinjar, where they owned a house, a car and a small business. The area was home to around 400,000 followers of the ancient Yazidi religion before it was stormed by fighters with the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant group (ISIL, also known as ISIS) in August 2014.
ISIL fighters systematically murdered Yazidi men and elderly residents, and captured and enslaved women and children. The UN estimated that around 3,000 were murdered and 6,000 taken captive.
""Our neighbours were Sunni Muslims and they told ISIS where to find us,"" said Wahda, who did not provide a last name. ""They wanted girls and they knew that we had so many girls.""
Her family was taken into captivity, with the exception of her eldest daughter, Almas, who was visiting relatives. She was shot in the back of the head as she tried to escape.
Locked in a room, Wahda and her daughters witnessed the rape and murder of other women held captive. They were held in terrible conditions, regularly beaten and forced to convert to Islam. After two months, they escaped with the help of a friend who had learned of their captivity. After returning to Sinjar, Wahda managed to find her husband, who had survived ISIL's massacre.
Sinjar was destroyed. After a harrowing journey across the mountain, stepping over the corpses and shallow mass graves that littered the ground, the family made it to the relative safety of Khanke camp. As Wadha recounts these events, her five-year-old daughter begins to cry.
The mass murder and enslavement of Yazidis in Iraq drew international attention. France, Germany, Canada and Australia offered asylum, while international NGOs channelled funding towards the hundreds of thousands of internally displaced Yazidis. But despite this, many have struggled to recover.
""We have had no psychological or physical support,"" Wahda said. ""I tried several NGOs, but either they didn't believe me that we were held in captivity, or they said that it was only two months, which is nothing, or that we weren't eligible because we were not raped. But my daughters' backs were black from bruises, and we have seen a lot.""
Khider Domle, a Yazidi researcher, academic and activist based in Dohuk, told Al Jazeera that while members of the Yazidi community have been offered basic supports, it is ""not for the long term"".
""Our psychological, social and religious identity has been destroyed,"" Domle said. ""People are living all over the place, and they don't know what the future is. There have been no initiatives from the Iraqi government to help the displaced people return back to Sinjar; no national reconciliation process; no attempt to rebuild ruined infrastructure.""
With local and international attention diverted to the ongoing battle against ISIL in Iraq and Syria, local activists say that the momentum behind an organised aid response for Yazidis appears to have dissipated. In the meantime, people within the Yazidi community are working to help each other.
Domle, who runs a women's centre and has been gathering testimonies from victims, is also helping to rescue the women and children who remain enslaved.
""We don't know where they have been taken, so the genocide is ongoing,"" he said, noting that part of his role is to gather information, which he then passes on to rescuers on the ground in ISIL-controlled areas. ""Always, non-stop, we are working, looking, cooperating.""
Many Yazidi activists have overcome enormous tragedy themselves. Adiba Qasim was 19 when ISIL stormed Sinjar. Along with her parents and three siblings, she escaped just 15 minutes before fighters began taking hostages.
Of her extended family, 70 people went missing; a few have returned, but the majority are either in captivity or mass graves.
Qasim and her family fled to a refugee camp in Turkey, where she noticed a lack of translators for Kurmanji, the Kurdish dialect that most Yazidis speak. She also noticed that survivors of ISIL's sexual slavery often emerged from interviews with journalists or NGO workers even more distressed than when they started.
""They were being asked things like, 'How many times were you raped?'"" Qasim said. ""I decided to learn English so I could work with women.""
Qasim had never been to school, as infrastructure in Sinjar was severely lacking even before the 2014 crisis, but she had an aptitude for languages. She found scraps of paper in bins and sometimes used old cigarette packets to practise writing English words. Within months, she could speak well enough to translate for NGO workers in the camp.
After a year, she decided to return to northern Iraq to help bring the stories of Yazidi women to the world. She now works as a fixer and translator for journalists and human rights organisations.
""It's hard to work on your own story, but I think this is the right place for me,"" Qasim said. ""It has been three years, and everybody knows what happened to Yazidis. Most of these women have told their stories 100 times, but they never received any help.""
When Wahda and her family found a base in Khanke camp, she embarked on a mission to find her eldest daughter's body. Someone had told her where Almas had been buried in a shallow grave. Against all odds, Wahda eventually found it, identifying her daughter's clothes and long black hair. She was able to give her daughter the proper burial rites, but the memory still haunts her.
A few months later, Wahda's daughter, Inas, signed up to fight with an all-female, all-Yazidi Peshmerga unit. Now 17, she spends a third of each month on the front lines. Her camouflage fatigues are hung prominently inside the rudimentary brick structure where the family now lives.
""It's good to be active, and to be a fighter,"" Inas told Al Jazeera. ""It's better to do something than nothing. I am fighting to avenge my sister and all the girls who are still in captivity.""

He recalls that many of his relatives were killed during the violence that followed months after British rule over Indian sub-continent ended.
""My father was young then and other immediate family members were in Kashmir at that time. But many of my relatives were brutally killed,"" the 63-year-old told Al Jazeera.
""To be honest that was a mad period. There was no humanity shown at that time,"" Khan, who retired as senior police officer, said at his home in Jammu.
In November 1947, thousands of Muslims were massacred in Jammu region by mobs and paramilitaries led by the army of Dogra ruler Hari Singh.
The exact number of casualties in the killings that continued for two months is not known but estimates range from 20,000 to 237,000 and nearly half million forced into displacement across the border into the newly created nation of Pakistan and its administered part of Kashmir.
Khan said many of his relatives had escaped to Pakistan, where they continue to live. ""The incident divided families. There were a lot of Muslims in Jammu but now you won't find many,"" he said.
The killings triggered a series of events, including a war between two newly independent nations of India and Pakistan, which gave birth to Kashmir dispute.
The killings took place when millions of Muslims, Hindus and Sikhs were crossing the border from the one side to the other, as part of British-designed plan to partition the subcontinent into India and Pakistan.
""The immediate impact (of partition) was in Jammu. The Muslim subjects from different parts of Jammu province were forcibly displaced by the Dogra Army in a programme of expulsion and murder carried out over three weeks between October-November 1947,"" Idrees Kanth, a fellow at International Institute of Social History in Amsterdam, who researched the 1940s history of Kashmir, told Al Jazeera.
In mid-October, the Dogra Army troops began expelling Muslim villagers from Jammu province. The refugees were sent on foot toward West Punjab (later to form part of Pakistan), where most were accommodated in refugee camps in the districts of Sialkot, Jhelum, Gujrat and Rawalpindi.
On November 5, Kanth said, the Dogra Army soldiers began another organised evacuation of the Muslims but ""instead of taking them to Sialkot, as they had been promised, the trucks drove them to forest hills of Rajouri districts of Jammu, where they were executed"".
Kanth added that there may have been a systematic attempt by the dying Dogra regime to ensure that records of the incident are destroyed and made it a lesser known massacre of the partition.
""I guess as happens with certain events, they got lost to history and resurface at a later time and in that sense they sort of rewrite our memory of the past. I would say the particular incident was sort of lost on us to a great extent until the post 1990s when the event was resurrected as yet another example of Dogra regime's communal politics,"" Kanth said.
The historians say that the killings carried out by the Hindu ruler's army and Sikh army was a ""state sponsored genocide"" to bring out demographic changes in Jammu - a region which had an overwhelming population of Muslims.
""The massacre of more than two lakh (two hundred thousands) Muslims was state-sponsored and state supported. The forces from Patiala Punjab were called in, RSS (a right-wing Hindu organisation) was brought to communalise the whole scenario and kill Muslims,"" said PG Rasool, the author of a book The Historical Reality of Kashmir Dispute.
The Muslims, who constituted more than 60 percent of the population of Jammu region, were reduced to a minority after the killings and displacement.
He said that when the then Indian Prime Minister of India Pandit Jawahar Lal Nehru and Kashmiri leader Sheikh Abdullah met a delegation of Muslims in Jammu, they were told about the ""tragic events"" but they preferred to remain silent.
""They didn't want that people in Kashmir - which had a Muslim majority from the beginning - should know about it because it could have led to demonstrations. The state from the beginning has tried to cover up it. I don't call it massacre but it was a staged genocide that is unfortunately not talked about,"" he said.
""They thought even if they lose Kashmir at least they should get Jammu and the only way was to have a Hindu majority.""
Muhammad Ashraf Wani, a professor of History at the University of Kashmir, said that the Muslims in Jammu ""do not talk about it because they fear for their survival"".
""This is the worst tragedies in the history of Kashmir but unfortunately no one talks about it because the state doesn’t want anyone to remember it,"" Wani said.
Khurram Parvez, a noted human rights defender in Kashmir, told Al Jazeera that the perpetual conflict in Kashmir has its roots in 1947 massacre. ""It is deliberately forgotten. Actually, the violence of that massacre in 1947 continues. Those who were forced to migrate to Pakistan have never been allowed to return,"" he said.
Five days after the Jammu killings, tribal militias from Pakistan’s North Western Frontier Province (now Khyber Pakhtunkhwa), where many of the Jammu Muslims had family ties, invaded Kashmir.
As the army of tribesmen rushed to Kashmir, the army of Dogra monarch fled to Jammu. The king Hari Singh signed the instrument of accession with New Delhi, which sent its army to fight the tribesmen.
The fighting of several weeks between tribesmen and Indian Army eventually led to first India-Pakistan war. When New Delhi and Islamabad agreed to a ceasefire in January 1948, the formerly princedom of Jammu and Kashmir was divided between the two countries.
The conflict born in 1947 has led to three wars between India and Pakistan. An estimated 70,000 people have been killed in the violence in past three decades since the armed revolt against Indian rule broke out in the region in 1989.

The facility once formed the cornerstone of Australia's controversial refugee resettlement policy, but had been ruled illegal by PNG's Supreme Court in 2016.
A year later, the Australian government complied with the decision to shutter it.
It turned off the power, cut the water supply, and pulled its people out - leaving behind 587 men who have barricaded themselves inside the camp, saying they fear attacks from locals if they are relocated.
Of them, 447 are confirmed refugees while the other 140 have had their applications rejected and are waiting on the Australian government to return them.
Ever since the group has been in a standoff with PNG officials, triggering a political crisis around what to do with the men who won't leave, but can't stay.
Refugee on Manus with severe kidney stones, crying from pain. Govt obviously violating human rights. I'm witnessing a tragedy, a disaster.
""[The Australian government] left us here in this jungle. It is a jungle. A jungle and an ocean,"" Behrouz Boochani, a refugee held on Manus Island, told Al Jazeera over the phone from the detention centre.
""There are no medical services, no food, no water. Nothing here. And yet they left us here.""
Boochani is an Iranian journalist who founded the Kurdish newspaper Werya, but was forced to flee in 2013 when its offices were raided by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.
He was picked up by the Australian government while attempting a boat crossing from Indonesia and held on Manus Island as a refugee.
Since then, he has become a spokesman for the men who have spent the last four years in limbo while they waited on the Australian government to make a decision about their fate.
Having been left to fend for themselves, Boochani says the situation is growing desperate.
On Saturday night, one man collapsed with chest pains but did not receive medical treatment, and starvation is starting to set in as police and navy personnel stopped all deliveries of food and medicine.
""We are prepared to stay here and die in this prison camp,"" says Boochani.
In response to the crisis, the Australian government has defended itself by pointing out it has offered alternative accommodation for the men, though two of the facilities on offer are currently still under construction.
The only operational facility is in Lorengau, which the detainees say is not equipped to handle 600 men, lacks proper medical services, and is located in a community that is hostile towards them.
Inside Australia, the series of events have triggered rallies calling on the Australian government to end the crisis by resettling the men.
Jonno Revanche attended a rally in Sydney and was involved in an earlier sit-in at the Department of Immigration and Border Protection offices. He told Al Jazeera that supporters fear the government will leave the men to die.
""[This government] doesn't represent what even a lot of 'traditional' Australians would even deem acceptable,"" Revanche said.
""I think if the majority of Australians listened to the people on Manus, and clearly saw how they were treated up close, they'd be outraged and deeply in opposition to what is happening.""
The situation has not gone unnoticed by international bodies.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (UNHCR) warned of an ""unfolding humanitarian emergency"" in a press conference last Friday, where it repeated its criticism of Australia's current policy of offshore detention as ""unsustainable, inhumane and contrary to its human rights obligations"".
""We have serious concerns about the welfare, safety and well-being of the roughly 600 men who remain in the accommodation compound, who are too frightened to leave,"" UNHCR spokesperson Rupert Colville said.
This was echoed by Elaine Pearson of Human Rights Watch who visited the island in October and said the situation on Manus Island had grown ""increasingly desperate"" over the weekend.
""In the immediate term, there's an emergency for food, for water and medical assistance for the men who are in that centre, whether it's provided by the UN or the PNG government in the long run,"" Pearson said.
""This is an Australian-made humanitarian catastrophe because Australia is walking away from its obligation. It's basically paying off the PNG government and trying to shirk off its international obligations onto a poor country.""
All of this has placed mounting pressure on the ruling conservative government, which has steadily implemented a deterrence-based refugee policy since taking office in 2013.
For a moment, a limited solution appeared to be possible on Sunday when New Zealand's Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern arrived in Australia to meet with Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull and renewed an offer to resettle 150 refugees in New Zealand.
The offer had been first been made to Australia in 2013 by former New Zealand Prime Minister John Key, but was turned down out of concern it might restart people-smuggling operations in the region.
Turnbull, however, rejected Ardern's proposal citing an existing deal with the US that would accept 1,250 people, subject to vetting by local authorities.
That deal was originally struck with the US at the end of Barrack Obama's presidency, and was originally seen by members of the Australian government as a convenient way out of an intractable problem.
However, the election of Donald Trump complicated matters.
A leaked transcript of a phone conversation between Turnbull and the US president showed Trump was deeply hostile to the idea, even as he praised Australia's hard-line refugee policy.
""That is a good idea. We should do that too. You are worse than I am,"" Trump said when it was explained to him.
How likely the resettlement programme is to proceed remains in question, and so with no political solution in sight, those on Manus Island continue to live under a state of siege.
""I want the people around the world to understand, we have been forgotten people for four years,"" Boochani said.
""I want people to hear our voice.""

This is the ironic reality in the southern Damascus camp for Palestinian refugees, which has been under partial or total siege since late 2012, barring most residents from exit and re-entry.
Yarmouk has all but emptied since then, with multiple attacks causing mass displacements. Hundreds of Palestinians have died in and around Yarmouk in recent years, either as a result of starvation or a lack of access to medical supplies.
But through a complex bureaucratic process, those who died outside of the camp have been able to secure burial within its borders.
For nearly two years, Syrian and Palestinian officials have been helping to facilitate the process of returning bodies to Yarmouk for burial. In Damascus, the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) arranges for the bodies to be transferred to Yarmouk, while a Syrian security agency approves a permit allowing them to be brought across a checkpoint separating regime-held and rebel-controlled areas of Damascus. A local organisation, known as the Palestinian Civil Committee, then liaises with Syrian opposition groups in areas bordering Yarmouk to handle funeral arrangements.
There have been several such burials in recent weeks, including that of a one-year-old girl.
""People are dying every day, and they need graves,"" Ibrahim, a Palestinian in Damascus who declined to give his last name for security reasons, told Al Jazeera. ""Before, people were struggling to find cemeteries to bury their loved ones.""
More than 315 Palestinians have been buried in Yarmouk under this arrangement since the first burial in January 2016, according to local activists and relief workers.
A manager with the civil committee told Al Jazeera that people insisted on returning bodies to Yarmouk for burial ""because of the symbolism of the camp and also because of the high prices of graves in cemeteries in Damascus"", with the cost for a grave in Damascus pegged at around 300,000 Syrian pounds ($580), compared with 10,000 pounds ($19) in Yarmouk.
Bodies must cross front lines through areas controlled variously by regime forces, rebels and Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL, also known as ISIS) fighters.
Ibrahim has had two relatives buried in Yarmouk, accompanying their bodies through the south of the city.
""If you are in a regime area, you have to obey their laws, and the same in the opposition areas. In the camp, you have to follow ISIL's rules,"" Ibrahim said.
Much of Yarmouk remains under ISIL's control after the group stormed the camp in 2015.
The return to Yarmouk is suffused with symbolism. Palestinian-Syrians sometimes refer to the devastated camp as their piece of Palestine in lieu of Palestine itself. Some 4,500 civilians currently remain inside Yarmouk, compared with a prewar Palestinian population of around 150,000, according to aid agencies.
""Everyone who has been displaced from Yarmouk has the hope and desire that one day they will go back ... alive or dead,"" local relief worker Obaydah al-Masri told Al Jazeera. ""The people who are returned for burial in the camp were born there, raised there. They lived the best days of their lives there.""
With Yarmouk still besieged and under the control of armed groups, however, death is all too often the only way that displaced residents can return home. Recent clashes between rebels and ISIL fighters have resulted in fresh checkpoint closures and further access complications. Students and teachers have been refused entry to rebel-held southern Damascus, while civilians injured in clashes have been trapped inside the camp.
Earlier this year, Palestinian-Syrian refugee Wafa Idrees travelled to Damascus with the body of her elderly mother, who died in Lebanon and was finally laid to rest in Yarmouk. ""It was easy because the PLO was there to help us, to the point that we buried my mother the same day that her body arrived to Damascus,"" Idrees told Al Jazeera.
It can seem like a miracle of sorts that the passage of the dead involves so many groups active in the Syrian conflict: the regime, the PLO, opposition groups and armed fighters, who provide tacit permission for the process.
But local activists say that while the PLO might be honouring the dead, it is not doing enough to protect the living, either by helping to transfer emergency medical cases out of Yarmouk and the southern suburbs for treatment, or by pushing for better humanitarian access into and out of the camp.
The status quo is still costing lives on a regular basis. In September, Palestinian refugee Mahmoud Daniel Fadel died of cancer in a neighbourhood next to Yarmouk. Activists and relief workers reportedly appealed to the PLO on several occasions to help get Fadel into Damascus for life-saving chemotherapy treatment, but to no avail.
There are rare exceptions, and last week a handful of ill or injured Palestinians were transferred out of Yarmouk. But for most, the only route in and out of the camp is in a coffin.
""Palestinians from Yarmouk aren't allowed to enter or leave the camp … except when they are dead and need to be buried,"" said former resident Muhammad al-Najmeh, who fled towards Germany in 2012.
""Palestinians started calling the PLO the 'cemetery of the Palestinians.' It's supposed to be there to help Palestinians, but it can only help them once they've died.""

The attacks were largely levelled at Muslim women - 56 percent of victims of 642 incidents were female. Sixty-six percent of perpetrators were male, and 69 percent were white men. Victims came from a variety of ethnic backgrounds.
Although not all Muslim women wear clothing that identifies them as followers of the Islamic faith, those who don the headscarf, face veil, robe and other garments are disproportionately targeted of gendered Islamophobia, said the report, which was released on Thursday.
Coming from an ethnic minority background, being female and Muslim has created a brand of Islamophobia with an ""intersectional nature"", crossing boundaries of gender, race and religion, Tell MAMA said.
In the week following the EU referendum vote, the charity reported a 475 percent spike in anti-Muslim attacks, a jump also witnessed after the Tower Bridge attacks.
""One major driver of Islamophobia is the way certain sections of the media have reported on Muslims,"" Miqdaad Versi, assistant general of the Muslim Council of Britain (MCB), told Al Jazeera.
""When commentators use terms like 'The Muslim Problem', it reinforces this narrative and all the differences that have been identified which perpetuate stereotypes and reify the good/bad Muslim dichotomy. That way it's much easier to believe it is acceptable to treat them differently.""
Events that lead to Muslims being portrayed as ""the problem"", include attacks and an ongoing discussion on halal meat being branded as animal cruelty.
""[This] has created this idea that Muslims are the 'other'. The government needs to take serious action to tackle hate crime against all communities in an equal and proportionate manner, which as it stands right now, is not the case,"" Versi said.
Al Jazeera spoke to victims about their experiences:
""Growing up, I never felt Islamophobia was the norm. You heard about something happening to someone after an attack, and that was it. But my experiences of late have forced me to change my opinion, because the truth is, anti-Muslim attacks have now become normal.
I remember going to an event in broad daylight during the summer. I was approaching the venue and this guy, who I remember looked quite mature and was very drunk, came towards me. There was a bus stop in front of me with people gearing to go home. He approached me and said: 'I hate the fact that you Muslims are in this country.'
At first, I was really shocked, because he approached me in a really aggressive way, so I crossed the road for my own safety. I said to him: 'Get out of my way.' I wasn't having any of it.
Adamah Jumah
All the while, the people at the bus stop were just standing there watching to see what was going on. Then the man started shouting obscene language and abuse, telling me to 'go back to my own country'.
I shouted back: 'I was born in this country, so how about that?' Then he started to make monkey noises. I eventually went inside the venue, I tried to act like I was OK, I was cool. He was just a drunk guy, he didn't do me any harm. But a few minutes later, I was really shaking inside.
I think I underestimated how frightening it was to be approached like that, to the point that someone approached me and asked if I was OK. I said I was fine, but inside, I wasn't.""
""A couple of days after Trump was elected, I was walking in the city centre of Bradford with a group of friends. We were behind two men, one of whom was clearly drunk.
He turned around and started shouting things like: 'Go home Pakis!' He kept turning around spouting racist abuse, but we ignored him.
When he realised we were ignoring him, he said: 'Do you want me to pull out my Stanley knife?'
Samayya Afzal
He put his hand in his pocket as though he was going to get something, and started to approach us but his friend grabbed him and dragged him away from us.
At that moment, we had no idea if he had a knife or not, so we turned a corner and went into a local cafe to regroup.
When you're in Bradford as a minority and a Muslim, you expect it to be safe because you're surrounded by people that look like you. We were a big group, too, so we thought that would protect us even though most of us were visibly Muslim, but it didn't.""
""A few weeks after the EU referendum, I was walking my son to school along a route I always take. A gentleman I walked past said something to me. I thought he was asking for a lighter for his cigarette, so I told him I don't smoke.
He looked at me really funny and said: 'What are you doing here? Shouldn't you go back home?' So I replied: 'I'm British. I was born here, this is my home!' I gave him a history lesson and told him my grandfather fought for this country. Then he said: 'Well if this is your home, we voted you out. So why are you still here?'
Arry Neesa
In the space of two seconds, it went from that to him trying to punch my son who he thought was an easy target. I was a normal person who had walked down this road a hundred times, but in the space of a few weeks, this man now felt like he had the right to point out that I no longer belonged in this country.
I don't wear a hijab [headscarf], but the fact is he associated my being brown, being Asian, with being Muslim.
In the same week, someone plastered a sticker exclusively on my front door, not on any other doors in the neighbourhood, saying: 'Join us. Follow the Pegida movement.' Instead of 'Refugee Muslims, it said 'Rapefugee Muslims'. For the first time in my life, I was made to feel that I wasn't British; I was Muslim.""
""Soon after the Paris attacks and the Bataclan shooting, I was sat on the District Line tube on the way to work.
There was this old lady who must have been in her 70s or 80s who was standing, so I decided to offer her my seat.
Muraad Chaudhury
As I got up and gestured to her, asking her if she wanted to sit down, she screamed and said she didn't want to take a seat from a 'terrorist like me'. The people around her were taken aback.
One woman stood up and said: 'No, that's out of order. You shouldn't say things like that about this nice young man who is offering you a seat.'
I felt shocked and embarrassed because I'd never experienced anything like that before, so I decided to get off at the next station.""

Local residents told Al Jazeera the raid targeted the Alaf market in the northern province of Saada shortly after midnight on Wednesday, killing 29 men and wounding at least nine others as they slept.
Rescue workers were continuing to search for seven missing people late into the evening, but videos from the scene showed the area completely destroyed by the attack with fires still burning from the charred frames of the shops.
The bodies of the victims, many of their faces disfigured beyond recognition, were laid out on white body bags for families to identify in the courtyard of a hospital morgue.
Abdulrahman, local resident
Al Masirah, a TV channel run by the Houthis - a group of rebels who control Saada province, the capital Sanaa, as well as other parts of central Yemen - confirmed the death toll.
Abdulrahman, who declined to give his surname, said there were no Houthi fighters in the area when the attack happened.
""The air strike completely decimated the market,"" he told Al Jazeera.
""Because of repeated air strikes and mortar fire from the Saudi border, many Yemeni workers have resorted to sleeping in their shops as it's too dangerous to be on the roads at night.
""Anything that moves is at the threat of being bombed,"" he added. ""Nowhere is safe from these criminals.""
A spokesman for the Saudi-led coalition did not respond to Al Jazeera's request for comment.
Saada, a Houthi stronghold, has been repeatedly targeted by Saudi-led aerial bombardment since a coalition of Arab states joined the war in March 2015.
""We are deeply saddened to hear of the reports coming from Saada today and our UN partners are verifying the incident,"" Shabia Mantoo, a spokesperson for the UN's refugee agency in Yemen (UNHCR), told Al Jazeera.
""With the conflict prolonging in Yemen, we are seeing hostilities intensify, humanitarian needs accumulate and civilians bearing the brunt.""
The war in Yemen, the Arab region's poorest country, started in 2014 after Houthi fighters seized control of Sanaa and began pushing south towards the country's third-biggest city, Aden.
Concerned by the rise of the Houthis, believed to be backed by regional rival Iran, Saudi Arabia and a coalition of Sunni Arab states launched an intervention in 2015 in the form of a massive air campaign aimed at reinstalling President Adb-Rabbu Mansour Hadi's government.
According to the United Nations, the number of air raids per month is now three times higher than last year, and monthly reports of armed clashes are up 50 percent.
More than 10,000 people have been killed and at least 40,000 wounded, mostly from Saudi-led air strikes.
The Saudi-led air campaign and subsequent land, air and naval blockade have created a humanitarian disaster. Cholera is on the rise and nearly 70 percent of the population is dependent on aid.
""A peaceful political solution is required more than ever to protect civilian life and to mitigate suffering,"" Mantoo said.

https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/10/refugees-limbo-manus-detention-centre-shuts-171030211900096.html,refugee,899,Tue Oct 31 2017 08:05:49 GMT+0000,Yarno Ritzen,Refugees in limbo as Manus detention centre shuts,"A Manus Island detention centre where more than 600 refugees have spent several years after trying to reach Australia will be closed on Tuesday by Papua New Guinea (PNG) authorities.
The 600 men that are held in the centre will be forcibly moved to new facilities in Lorengau, a city about five kilometres from the detention centre, officials said.
Australia has used Manus as an offshore detention centre since 2013, when the country struck a deal with PNG and Nauru to hold refugees fleeing to Australia in camps on the islands.
However, in 2015, the PNG Supreme Court ordered that the Manus detention centre should be closed because it is unconstitutional.
Parts of the camp have already shut. On Sunday, the mess hall was closed and food packages were handed out to the refugees.
A message posted inside the detention centre earlier on Tuesday stated that access to water and electricity would be cut off, and that the refugees were ""advised to move to alternative accommodation now"".
""From tomorrow, arrangements will be under way for the return to this site to the PNGDF [PNG Defense Force]. Anyone choosing to remain here will be liable for removal from an active PNG military base"", the statement said, referencing the fact the detention centre is originally a naval base.
Nick McKim, MP for the Green Party in Australia, said the closure of the camp does not solve anything.
""In the absence of resettlement in a safe country, the closure of the centre is not a solution at all. The best and easiest solution to this humanitarian disaster is to resettle the men in Australia,"" a spokesman for McKim told Al Jazeera.
""These men sought refuge in Australia and they remain Australia's responsibility, legally and morally.""
Elaine Pearson, Australia Director of Human Rights Watch (HRW), told Al Jazeera that the camp should be closed in line with the PNG Supreme Court ruling.
""But the people held there should be brought to safety in Australia or other third countries, not abandoned to stay in less-secure facilities run by the PNG government on Manus Island,"" she added.
More than 600 refugees have lived in the detention centre since 2013.
Their treatment by Australia and PNG has been the centre of criticism by both people living in the camp and human rights organisations.
But despite the impending closure of the camp, the refugees do not want to move to Lorengau because they are afraid of what might happen to them there.
""Refugees don't want to move because they don't feel safe. They are terrified given an escalation in brutal attacks against refugees and asylum seekers in Lorengau town. Some have even occurred in daytime,"" Pearson said.
""Police have failed to investigate these attacks.""
McKim's spokesman echoed this sentiment.
""Many of them fear leaving the centre, having seen their friends being attacked by the local community. They are also deeply fearful of being forcibly removed and placed into danger somewhere else.""
The refugees confirmed these fears in a series of interviews with Al Jazeera.
""Right now, the only thing we can do is to resist the move, as we know death is waiting for us outside this centre,"" Amir, an Iranian refugee, told Al Jazeera.
Despite the lack of water, food and electricity in the camp, Amir said that staying at the facility was their only option. ""We know that without food and water, we are dead too, but at least we don't walk to our death with our own feet,"" he said.
The refugees are also uncertain what would happen to them if they indeed move to Lorengau. Those whose asylum applications are approved, are expected to blend into the local community.
Those who are denied asylum will be either sent back to their home country if it is deemed safe for them to go back, or they will be held in detention indefinitely until a third country offers to take them in.
In addition to feared hostilities by Manus locals, and the uncertainty about what will happen to them once they move to Lorengau, the current state of the centres there also worries the refugees.
""The new camps are not all finished, which means there simply are not enough beds ready for the men. This is untenable and unfair,"" the spokesman for McKim said.
One of the solutions that Australia has offered is to move the refugees to third countries. Australia has a refugee deal with the United States, but the US has only taken in about 50 refugees as of yet, and has not stated how many it is willing to take in total.
Another option is New Zealand, which has offered to take in 150 refugees.
However, there are about 1,600 refugees in all of Australia's offshore detention centres. Besides Manus, there is the Nauru camp as well.
""Like Manus Island, Nauru is not a suitable place for refugees. The Greens urge the government to close the Nauru detention centre and bring the men, women and children to Australia,"" HWR's Pearson said, adding that Australia is still responsible for those who do not get to move to thirds countries.
""The US deal is not an excuse for Australia to do nothing, which is what has happened. Australia still has a responsibility to these refugees to provide them a safe country to settle - and PNG is clearly not safe.""

https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/10/manus-refugees-death-slavery-171029075158613.html,refugee,1640,Mon Oct 30 2017 09:14:43 GMT+0000,Yarno Ritzen,Manus refugees: 'Death is better than this slavery',"On Tuesday, Australia will close the offshore camp on Manus Island after the Supreme Court of Papua New Guinea (PNG) ruled last year that the detention of refugees there was unconstitutional.
Food, water and electricity will be cut off, leaving more than 600 refugees fearful for their future. Most have lived on Manus for years, after Australia decided it did not want the refugees on its mainland; now, they will be relocated to the PNG town of Lorengau.
Al Jazeera spoke with four refugees about how they ended up on Manus, their treatment by Australia, and their thoughts about the future.
Persia arrived in Australia in 2013, in a boat with 80 other refugees fleeing from Indonesia. It was his second attempt; his first boat, carrying about 60 people, sank. Shipwrecked on a small island, Persia and the other survivors were eventually saved and brought back to Indonesia.
Despite almost dying the first time, Persia was determined to make it to Australia, and he tried again.
Upon arrival on Australian shores, however, the group was immediately arrested by Australian authorities and sent to Manus.
""All people were brought by force, in handcuffs, to Manus Island,"" said Persia, who spoke to Al Jazeera under a pseudonym for fear of repercussions. ""I thought Australia was a country which applied human rights, but I was totally wrong.""
His treatment over the last few years has led Persia to distrust anyone acting on behalf of the Australian or PNG governments.
""We are like lab rats,"" he said. ""I have been monitored by the Australian government for 4.5 years. They know what I like and dislike, and what colour is my underwear, and my family, and my weaknesses, and all details.
""I don't see any future,"" he added. ""Honestly, death is better than this slavery.""
In recent months, parts of the Manus detention centre have been prepared for the removal of the refugees. Fox Camp, the largest living area, was the first to be closed, with residents forced to crowd into other areas. Facilities and services such as the gym, library and access to English classes have been cut off.
""We all are in extreme stress,"" Persia said. ""The situation is extremely horrible ... There is no future for me, because the cruel government doesn't want me to live like a human being.""
In the days leading to the closure of Manus, several signs were placed around the camp, warning the refugees that other facilities would gradually be shut down as well. On Sunday, the mess was closed, and food packets were distributed among the refugees - two packets per person, barely enough to get them through the two remaining days.
The meals are to be prepared on a microwave or stove, but neither is available to the refugees in the camp. A small salad is provided as well, but the refugees do not have refrigerators to keep it from going bad.
Moving to Lorengau is not an option for Persia, he said, as other refugees have done so only to face abuse at the hands of an unwelcoming local community.
""They said they would cut everything off to push people to move out, but we will stay inside, because inside is safe,"" he said. ""We don't want to move out. [We will stay] until they shoot us.""
Kurdish-Iranian journalist Behrouz Boochani arrived to Manus in 2013 after fleeing the city of Ilam in Iran for fear of imprisonment, after the offices of the newspaper where he worked were raided and 11 of his colleagues arrested. In a first attempt to reach Australia, his boat sank, and he barely survived; the second time, his boat was spotted by the Australian navy.
Even in captivity, Boochani has remained true to his profession. One of the most outspoken people in Manus camp, he says he hopes that talking about the abysmal conditions will make others listen.
""The situation in Manus prison camp is like we are living in a war zone, because the refugees are ready for something bad to happen,"" he told Al Jazeera. ""At any time, soldiers could attack the prison camp.""
The option of relocating to Lorengau is a bad one, Boochani said.
""The local people are very angry with the Australian government, because they feel that the government humiliated them and did not care about their wants,"" he said. ""They are ready to send their message to Australia through beating up the refugees. They already did that a lot of times, and a lot of refugees were beaten up and robbed by local people.
""This place is not a safe place for the refugees, because there is not any protection for them.""
The looming prospect of PNG security forces swooping in to clear Manus camp is a frightening one for Boochani. Earlier this year, nine refugees were injured after a small dispute with security forces escalated and shots were fired, he said.
A deal between the United States and Australia, under which the US has promised to take in an unspecified number of people from Manus and Nauru, has raised hopes for some, while others remain sceptical.
""Why is it that Australia and the world don't want to understand this simple thing - that the refugees did not come to this country and don't want to be here?"" Boochani asked. ""Why don't they want to understand that these people have been tortured for more than four years?""
Abdul arrived on Christmas Island, an Australian territory, in July 2013 after fleeing from the conflict in Afghanistan.
He was unaware that Australia had just struck a deal with PNG and Nauru for offshore detention centres, and that he would be sent to Manus. Several others who had travelled on his boat were sent to Nauru, which houses single women and families.
A year later, in June 2014, Abdul, who declined to provide his last name, was officially recognised as a refugee.
""I was offered to resettle in Papua New Guinea,"" he told Al Jazeera. ""I'm resisting it to this very day, afraid I will be attacked by locals. Most of the locals do not want us here.""
Reports of refugees being beaten and robbed after moving from Manus to Lorengau have been rampant, with some later opting to move back to the relative safety of Manus.
Ronny Knight, a former representative for Manus in the PNG parliament, said after two refugees were beaten on New Year's Eve by Lorengau police: ""[They] deserved what they got"". And now, with the Manus detention centre closing, the governor of Manus has threatened to block the transfer of the refugees to a new facility, saying he could not guarantee their safety.
Abdul says he has no plans to leave the detention centre.
""We're staying, because we want a solution to our endless suffering. We are in danger,"" he said. ""Everyone in detention is so scared. The mood is very down. We have fear that we will be removed forcibly to Lorengau.""
After more than four years of staying quiet, Abdul said the pressure has built to the point where he had to speak out.
""Australia treats me like an animal in a zoo. I have experienced trauma, depression, stomach problems ... I've never been scared like I am now,"" he added. ""I have lost everything, so I'll speak against injustice. ""
Abdul and some of his peers pooled their money to buy a few mobile phones, with credits provided by sympathetic Australians. Using these phones, they have posted photos and statements about their deteriorating conditions on a public Telegram channel called Manus Alert. It is their only real connection to the outside world.
Still, as the closure of the detention centre approaches, Abdul has no faith in the future.
""I don't see any future here. My hope is crushed,"" he said. ""In Afghanistan, I had a way out. Here, I do not see any way out.""
Amir fled Iran at the age of 15. After spending several years in Malaysia, he left for Australia with the goal of applying for political and religious asylum.
He eventually arrived on Christmas Island, but was sent to Manus in 2013.
""Imagine being in a prison on a tropical island, thousands of kilometres away from home. No lawyer, no sentence and no rights. No nothing,"" Amir told Al Jazeera.
Amir, an aspiring writer and actor who studied literature and humanities, says the already bad conditions that the refugees have been living in for years have recently deteriorated.
""Dirty food, dirty conditions, malaria, terrible treatment by the guards and in some cases, assaults and insults,"" he said. ""And now, they want to cut running water, power, food, drinking water - and they want to remove the fencing that protects refugees from attacks by the locals.""
As a result, he says, the mental and physical health of the refugees has greatly been affected, especially after part of the centre was closed down earlier this year.
However, like the majority of people living there, Amir does not plan on moving from the camp.
""East Lorengau is another limbo, and if we move there, the Australian government can claim they have closed Manus detention [centre], which is false. That place can't hold more than 400 people and is a mental illness factory,"" he said.
With only hours left before the camp shuts down and the refugees are forcibly moved, Amir says that a bleak future awaits him.
""Right now, the only thing we can do is to resist the move, as we know death is waiting for us outside this centre,"" he said. ""We know that without food and water, we are dead too, but at least we don't walk to our death with our own feet.""

The Nationalist Front, the coalition, held Saturday's protest, which included the participation of the neo-fascist Traditionalist Worker Party (TWP), the National Socialist Movement (NSM), the neo-Confederate League of the South and other white supremacist groups.
At the rally in Shelbyville, the white supremacist demonstrators chanted ""Jews will not replace us"", a slogan that has become commonplace at far-right events in the US.
A second rally slated to be held in nearby Murfreesboro was reportedly cancelled by organisers. In a Twitter post, the League of the South's Hunter Wallace said the event was called off because he had ""intel"" that it was a ""lawsuit trap"".
In response, hundreds of anti-fascists (Antifa) and other counterdemonstrators from across the state and elsewhere in the US converged on the Tennessee towns.
Local media reports said that shop owners boarded up their businesses before the ""White Lives Matter"" rally, while Middle Tennessee State University in Murfreesboro cancelled a student band competition and placed two student housing facilities on lockdown.
The Nationalist Front and its allies chose the central Tennessee towns to protest refugee resettlement, the opioid crisis gripping the country and a mass shooting allegedly carried out by a Sudanese man at a church in that state last month.

""This isn't the first time that extreme outside groups have seen Tennessee's growing multiculturalism as an opportunity to sow fear and build support for their far-right movements by scapegoating refugees,"" Stephanie Teatro, co-executive director of Tennessee Immigrant and Refugee Rights Coalition, told Al Jazeera by email.
""We are deeply disturbed by how emboldened white supremacists have become in recent months, demonstrating with greater visibility and frequency, but also how their extreme visions of Americans have been mainstreamed into state and federal policies,"" Teatro said.
""Long after these outsiders leave, we'll continue to build more connected communities that are resilient to these far-right groups.""
The white nationalists start with the ""Jews will not replace us!"" Counter-protesters rile them up with chants of ""We. Will. Replace you!"" pic.twitter.com/n784Bxh8I9
Among the scheduled speakers were TWP's Matthew Heimbach, the League of the South's Michael Hill, far-right podcaster Sacco Vandal and the NSM's Jeff Schoep.
Predicting a ""strong turnout"" in advance of Saturday's rallies, Schoep told Al Jazeera that the events marked the far right's ""first major street action"" since a deadly rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, just over two months ago.
On August 12, hundreds of neo-Nazis and white supremacists travelled from across the country to Charlottesville to protest the city's decision to tear down a Confederate monument. Participants clashed with community members, anti-racist activists and anti-fascists throughout the city.
By the end of the day, James Alex Fields, a 20-year-old Ohio resident, had allegedly rammed his car into an anti-racist march and killed 32-year-old activist Heather Heyer. The incident also left at least 19 people injured.
""The media is claiming we started or brought violence to Charlottesville and anyone, with even half of a brain who was actually there knows the truth the Antifa violently attacked anyone who was deemed pro-white or pro-American even,"" Schoep, who refers to himself as the NSM's commander, said by email.
He went on to allege that anti-fascists ""viciously attacked us with mace, bricks, bottles, bats, chemicals, and countless urine-filled balloons and bottles"" in Charlottesville.
The ""Unite the Right"" rally in Charlottesville and the killing of Heyer prompted a widespread public backlash against the alt-right, a loosely-knit coalition of white supremacists, white nationalists and neo-Nazis who advocate a white ethnostate.
Among those who shared Schoep's narrative of the events in Charlottesville was right-wing US President Donald Trump, who claimed deemed anti-fascists and other counterprotesters as the ""alt-left"".
Attributing blame to ""both sides"", Trump said at the time that counterdemonstrators were ""swinging clubs"" as they ""came charging at"" the far-right groups.
Trump's comments met widespread criticism from many on both sides of the political spectrum.
Earlier this month, white supremacist Richard Spencer, a leading figure in the alt-right, held a speech at the University of Florida in Gainesville.
Three of Spencer's supporters who travelled from Texas to Gainesville were arrested and charged with attempted homicide after one of them fired a gun in the direction of anti-racist protesters. No one was injured in that incident.
Mark Bray, author of Antifa: The Anti-Fascist Handbook, argued that ""it certainly seems"" that the Trump administration and mainstream political establishment have focused their efforts on cracking down on anti-fascists and anti-racist activists.
Bray alluded to the Department of Homeland Security's recent decision to cut funds for organisations that combat right-wing violence and hundreds of anti-fascists facing felony charges for their role in protests during Trump's January 20 inauguration.
Mark Bray, author of Antifa: The Anti-Fascist Handbook
""If you look at the fact that the Trump administration pulled back resources to investigate white supremacist violence, if you look at its dog-whistling and kind of more overt sympathies to the far right, if you look at charges from [January 20] and elsewhere … the establishment is generally more concerned about the left than the right,"" he told Al Jazeera.
Against this backdrop, Bray explained, anti-fascist activism has played a crucial role in confronting the swell of white supremacist events since Trump took office.
""Anti-fascist, anti-racist organising and broader societal pushback have done a pretty good job of depriving [the far right] of the kinds of opportunities for expanding beyond their base,"" he said.
The far-right group Anticom recently cancelled a December 28 torchlit rally dubbed ""March Against Communism"" in Charlotte, North Carolina. The alt-right's Spencer was slated to speak at the event, according to The Charlotte Observer.

https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/10/manus-detention-centre-closed-171024212852806.html,refugee,1174,Sun Oct 29 2017 14:33:56 GMT+0000,None,Why is the Manus detention centre being closed?,"On October 31, Australia's offshore immigration detention camp on Manus Island will shut down.
The controversial Papua New Guinea-based centre, dubbed ""Australia's Guantanamo"" by people living there, is currently home to about 600 refugees.
Once closed, the detainees will be forced to move elsewhere - either to a different part of Papua New Guinea (PNG) or a different country.
However, despite the centre's notoriety, its closure has led to criticism from both people within the camp and outside.
The Manus Regional Processing Centre is located on the small island of Manus, about 300km of the coast of the main island of Papua New Guinea. It is run by the Australian government in order to keep refugees out of Australia. People using boats to get to Australia's shores are stopped by the coastguard and subsequently sent to one of several detention centres, including in Manus.
The facility on Manus was established in 2001, together with a detention camp on Nauru. While the Nauru centre houses single women and families, including fathers, the Manus one holds only single men.
Both camps gradually fell into disuse and were eventually closed in 2008. But they reopened four years later, following a large increase in the number of refugees trying to reach Australia.
Australia, PNG and Nauru struck a deal under which the latter two would take in refugees from intercepted boats in exchange for money.
For the Manus Island camp, the plan was to subsequently house the refugees in PNG if their asylum claim was proven valid. If not, then the refugees would either be sent back to their country of origin; or to a different country; or remain in detention indefinitely.
The camp is run by Broadspectrum, an Australian company also managing the offshore detention centre on Nauru.
Christmas Island, which is an Australian territory, hosts a third detention centre.
The Manus camp has been widely criticised since its 2012 reopening - just like Nauru. The United Nations and human rights groups have described conditions in the centres as horrid, saying that refugees living there are subject to ""severe abuse and neglect"".
Since January 2014, there have been nine people held at the camps on the islands of Manus, Nauru and Christmas have died, according to Border Crossing Observatory, a Monash University-based research centre.
Four committed suicide, while the rest of the deaths include one case of suspected suicide, one death as a result of violence and three cases of accidents/illnesses.
Last year, British newspaper The Guardian published files detailing the ""devastating trauma and abuse inflicted on children held by Australia in offshore detention"", including assaults, sexual abuse and self-harm attempts.
In April 2017, there was a shooting when supposedly drunken PNG soldiers shot at refugees held at the centre. Nine people were wounded in the shooting that allegedly started after a conflict between detainees and guards got out of hand.
In June 2017, the Australian government also agreed to pay 70 million Australian dollars ($53m) to more than 1,900 asylum seekers who sued over their treatment at the Manus camp.
The men filed legal claims against the Australian government and two contractors who ran the camp between early 2012 and late 2014 over alleged physical and psychological injury they said they suffered, as well as for false imprisonment. One of these contractors, Broadspectrum, is still in charge of the Manus and Nauru detention centres.
As of October 2017, just over 600 men live in the Manus detention centre. They are not allowed to leave the camp to move around the island freely. Instead, they can only leave the camp on planned day trips.
Ultimately, the goal of the 2012 deal is to resettle those who are granted asylum in PNG. However, many of those held have refused to leave the camp and go to temporary transit centres out of fear the local population will attack them.
In a recent statement, the refugees said they are not planning to leave the Manus centre even after it closes.
The UN has warned of a ""humanitarian crisis"" amid fears Australia would walk away completely from any involvement with refugees on the tiny Pacific Island.
In April 2016, the PNG's Supreme Court ruled that the detention of refugees on Manus was illegal and in breach of fundamental human rights.
Some five months later, the governments of PNG and Australia presented plans for the closure of the camp, without offering an exact timeframe.
Earlier this year, parts of the camp were shut down in preparation for its final closure. Several compounds were demolished in advance of the planned shutting down, and refugees were told they had to prepare to be relocated in the PNG community, after transiting through the East Lorengau centre in PNG.
However, this would cover only those who were granted asylum, while no refugees would be resettled in Australia at any time.
Australia has said it will fund the operation of three new transit centres on Manus for detainees.
After the camp's closure, the fate of the 600 people living there will depend on the status of their individual claim to asylum.
If a refugee's claim is seen as valid, he will first be moved from Manus island to a transit camp near the town of Lorengau, where they allegedly would be prepared to move into the PNG community.
However, many refugees living in the camp have expressed fear for their safety if they have to move to Lorengau.
There have been several incidents during which refugees who were granted asylum were injured or mistreated in other ways by the local PNG population, according to human rights organisations. As a result, so most of them moved back to the Manus detention centre because they could not integrate in the PNG community.
For refugees whose claims are not seen as valid, the future appears even bleaker. If it is not safe for them to be repatriated, they will be resettled to a different country than Australia and PNG, or be held in detention indefinitely in one of the offshore camps where they often have already spent years of their lives.
One of the countries involved in the resettling of the refugees is the US, which struck a deal with Australia during the Obama administration to house an unspecified number refugees out of the 1,600 held in Australian offshore detention centres on the islands of Nauru and PNG.
However, the election of Donald Trump cast doubt over the agreement's future after the US president called it ""the worst deal ever"". Despite the criticism, the US has started resettling refugees from Manus.
So far, only 54 refugees have departed for the US.
As of now, it is unclear what the reaction of the PNG government will be if the people living in the Manus detention centre refuse to move to different locations after the camp's closure,
Since the people living in the centre will have no access to food, water or electricity and they refuse to leave, there is a risk the standoff will escalate into violence.

On October 9, Greek border guards arrested Mirzorahim Kuzov at Athens International Airport as he was flying from Warsaw - where he had attended an Organization for Security and Co-operation (OSCE) in Europe conference on human rights - to Tehran, via Greece.
He is now being held at a prison in Athens, having lived in hiding in a third country for the last two years.
His arrest was possible because of a red notice alert issued at Tajikistan's request, a tool which allows Interpol - an international network of police forces - to pursue people fleeing jurisdiction around the world.
Tajikistan accused Kuzov of ""extremism"" and participating in an anti-government coup in September 2015 - allegations he denies.
""Everything Tajikistan's government says about the IRPT or about me is a lie, slander. Interpol has become a weapon against the opposition and democratic forces,"" Kuzov told Al Jazeera.
Countries including Russia, Uzbekistan and China have previously used the Interpol red notice system.
""These governments have 'nominated' individuals for so-called crimes under their national criminal codes and often these crimes are not consistent with international legally recognised offences, or are so over-broad and vague as to void their meaning,"" Steve Swerdlow, Human Rights Watch (HRW) Central Asia researcher told Al Jazeera.
""Interpol has not instituted a system for vetting these cases in a way that would prevent real harm from being done to individuals,"" he said.
Kuzov is one of hundreds of opposition figures who fled Tajikistan in fear of their lives in September 2015.
""It is a bitter irony that [Kuzov] was arrested on his way back from a human rights conference in Warsaw, Poland. Greek authorities have an obligation under international law not to return him to Tajikistan where he faces the real possibility of torture and imprisonment on trumped-up charges,"" said Swerdlow.
Following the Tajik election of March 2015, the IRPT failed to reach the threshold for entering parliament, and was left out for the first time since the 1997 peace agreement which ended the civil war.
Shortly afterwards, President Emomali Rahmon began a campaign against the opposition.
In September 2015, former Defence Minister Abduhalim Nazarzoda was accused of - with the support of gunmen - attacking the main police station in Vahdat and the Ministry of Defence in Dushanbe. The authorities soon labelled the incident as a ""terrorist"" attack and accused the IRPT of plotting to overthrow the government.
Nazarzoda was soon killed in a shoot-out between rebels and government forces.
Although the party condemned the attacks and denied any connection with Nazarzoda, the government banned its operation and jailed all members who had not managed to leave the country.
""[If I stayed in Tajikistan] I would share the fate of my fellow party men and my friends. I would be now facing a life sentence or 25 to 30 years in prison,"" Kuzov said.
""Kuzov's case is similar to other senior leaders of the IRPT who have been targeted on politically motivated charges of engaging in an attempted coup in September 2015,"" said Swerdlow of HRW.
Kuzov said his family, who stayed in Tajikistan for a period after he fled, paid a high price for his political activity. They now live in Lithuania, where they have applied for refugee status.
""Their documents, including passports, were confiscated,"" he said. ""They were regularly harassed, intimidated and interrogated by the security services. They said to my wife that if I don't return, they will arrest her, our children and our relatives.""
Interpol's constitution obliges the organisation to respect individual freedom and rights.
In an email to Al Jazeera, Interpol refused to comment on Kuzov's case.
""If or when police in any of Interpol's 192 member countries share information with the General Secretariat in Lyon, France, in relation to investigations and individuals, this information remains under the ownership of that member country,"" the email read.
""Interpol does not, therefore, comment on specific cases or individuals except in special circumstances and with approval of the member country concerned.""
The organisation said that it considers all requests for the re-evaluation of individual cases.
However, the review procedure can be long and daunting and in cases like Kuzov's, there is no time for reassessment.
In November 2016, Interpol adopted a number of measures to improve its information processing mechanisms. For example, it began to remove names of people who have received refugee status from the red notice list.
However, Interpol has failed to apply sanctions against members who have violated its rules.
Kuzov will soon appear before the [Greek] Supreme Court which will make a decision on his extradition.
He remains optimistic.
""I hope that European countries and the OSCE will take all necessary measures not to allow for my deportation to Tajikistan,"" he said.

About 7.7 million people are on the verge of starvation in the DRC, of whom 3.3 million are in Kasai, an eastern province where 1.4 million have been forced to flee their homes over the past year after clashes broke out between the Kamwina Nsapu armed group and security forces.
More than 3,300 people have been killed in the violence.
""It's about as bad as it gets,"" David Beasley, executive director of the World Food Programme (WFP), told Al Jazeera on Saturday from the regional capital, Goma.
""If we don't receive funds, food and access immediately, hundreds of thousands of children will die over the next couple of months.""
Earlier this week, the UN refugee agency UNHCR said that about 710,000 people had gone back to the Kasai, only to ""find their property in ruins and family members killed"".
Farmers in Kasai have missed two consecutive planting seasons because of the violence.
The WFP has appealed for $17.2m to distribute food aid in Kasai from September to December 2017. So far, it has only raised one percent of that figure.
""We are asking donors to step up, and to step up now,"" Beasley told Al Jazeera.
The onset of the rainy season will increase the cost of delivery of food by up to 17 times as aid will have to be flown in due to impassable roads, he said.
""The situation in Kasai is desperate,"" he said. ""All because of nothing but man-made conflict. And it is wrong, it's unacceptable.""
WFP officials in Kasai have seen evidence of killings, including videos of decapitated men, women and children, Beasley said.
Violence in Kasai involving Kamwina Nsapu fighters broke out last August with the killing of a regional tribal leader who had defied the government of President Joseph Kabila.
In August, UN investigators said more than 250 people, including 62 children, were killed in Kasai from mid-March to mid-June.
Investigators have also uncovered about 80 mass graves in the region.
The violence adds to a broadly unstable situation in the DRC, with Kabila's government refusing to step down and hold elections as required by the country's constitution.
Violence in the provinces of Tanganyika and Kivu has separately forced thousands to flee their homes.
The UNHCR says the total number of people displaced by conflict in the DRC has nearly doubled in the past six months to 3.9 million.
The country is also having to cope with the arrival of about 500,000 refugees fleeing fighting in Burundi, Rwanda, South Sudan and the Central African Republic.

The number of people who have been internally displaced has increased by 50 percent since January 2017.
At least 600,000 are internally displaced across the country, while another 500,000 have found themselves across the border in Chad, Democratic Republic of Congo, Republic of Congo and Cameroon.
The latest data released by UNOCHA comes as UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres continues on his four-day visit to CAR on Thursday in what he describes as a ""visit of solidarity but of active solidarity"".
He has been lobbying for 900 more peacekeepers to join the mission and urged the international community to take action over a crisis that has killed thousands and destabilised the country.
""I think the conditions for civilians in CAR is worse than 2014,"" Stephanie Wolters, Central Africa analyst at the Institute for Security Studies in Pretoria, told Al Jazeera. ""More and more people are in need than ever before.""
Eric Batonon, Norwegian Refugee Council
CAR has been beset with conflict since Seleka coalition rebels marched into the capital, Bangui, and deposed of former President Francois Bozize. Though the country held elections in February 2016, the government has been unable to stem the conflict.
The administration is mostly absent outside the capital, with armed groups controlling large swaths of the countryside.
Eric Batonon, country director of Norwegian Refugee Council, based in Bangui, told Al Jazeera that part of the solution would be increasing protection.
Resurgent fighting between factions of Seleka rebels and Anti-balaka militia has deepened instability in the northwest and southeastern parts of the country.
This has forced aid agencies to leave their stations in some areas where humanitarian needs are high.
""Right now, civilians don't have access to aid and aid workers don't have access to civilians.
""If anything, it is clear that the situation is very critical; the fact that humanitarian actors continue to be targeted, means that situation is getting worse,"" he said.
At least 12 peacekeepers have been killed since the beginning of 2017, he added.
Wolters commended the UN's Guterres for his CAR visit, but warned against sending more UN peacekeepers.
""This is an intractable conflict, an unresolved one, and one has to appreciate that [Guterres] has gone there,"" she said. ""One of the problems is that the traditional tools of UN peacekeeping have not worked in places like CAR, or Burundi or the DRC, for that matter. This method of forming peace agreements and then holding elections, it has not worked.
""These methods have not ended conflict. We have to find ways to disincentivize the call to arms in the CAR.""
On Wednesday, Guterres told displaced people at a camp in the eastern of Bangassou that he was moved by their suffering.
""Sadly, what is happening here in Bangassou is not unique. Thousands of other Central Africans have had to flee,"" he said.
Guterres also attended a wreath-laying ceremony in the capital to pay homage to 12 peacekeepers that were killed in 2017.

The UN mission to CAR has been routinely accused of sexually exploiting and abusing women and children in the country.
Guterres told Al Jazeera he would be meeting survivors of sexual abuse by UN peacekeepers in the capital.
He said the UN have taken ""a number of measures to put the victims at the centre [of policy]"".

US President Donald Trump signed a new executive order on Tuesday that directs government agencies to resume the US refugee programme, but according to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), a 90-day review period for those arriving from ""11 countries previously identified as posing a higher risk to the United States"" will be put in place.
The order also said that new ""enhanced vetting"" procedures will be implemented for all refugees.
DHS officials declined to reveal the countries that are considered ""high risk"", but said in a statement that ""admissions for applicants from those 11 high-risk countries will move forward on a case-by-case basis"" during the review period.
The resumption of the refugee programme came as the 120-day ban on refugees ended on Tuesday.
In the latest executive order, Trump announced new ""enhanced vetting"" procedures for refugees entering the US.
Acting Secretary of Homeland Security Elaine Duke said in a statement that ""these new, standardised screening measures provide an opportunity for the United States to welcome those in need into our country, while ensuring a safer, more secure homeland.""
The new vetting procedures include increased data collection, better information sharing between US agencies and new training protocols for screening, DHS said, adding that ""following the implementation of these improved measures, the administration will recommence refugee resettlement processing.""
According to US media, officials will also take a closer look at social media accounts and collect more biographical data from applicants.
Al Jazeera's Gabriel Elizondo, reporting from New York, said some refugee rights organisations are ""already saying that this order does not do a lot to help refugees, particularly adult males who already go through a secondary screen process that is much more rigorous than the process for children or women"".
Amnesty International said in a statement prior to Tuesday's announcement that ""ripping families apart and subjecting refugees to yet more scrutiny does not keep anyone safer, and in fact exposes more people to danger"".
Trump initially signed an executive order in January that temporarily banned Syrian refugees, but that move was challenged in the courts.
A revised order was later issued that implemented a ban on all refugees, with some exceptions.
The Trump administration announced last month that it wants to reduce the number of refugees entering the country in 2018 to 45,000 - the lowest number in decades.
In 2016, the US admitted more than 84,000 refugees.

https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/10/jordan-change-sexist-nationality-law-171025061456316.html,refugee,1232,Wed Oct 25 2017 09:03:36 GMT+0000,Farah Najjar,Is Jordan likely to change 'sexist' nationality law?,"A petition circulating on social media calling for Jordan's controversial nationality law to be abolished is likely to be refused in parliament, activists say.
The petition, which has so far received 3,800 signatures, will be presented to the Jordanian parliament once it gathers 5,000 signatures.
But ""it is not at all that simple,"" says Aroub Soubh, a Jordanian activist.
Soubh has been working with civil society groups and NGOs on a campaign tackling what she describes as Jordan's ""sexist"" nationality law.
A campaign entitled ""My mother is Jordanian and her nationality is my right"" - established by late women's rights activist Nima Habashna - has branched out into a grassroots project by a coalition of local rights groups called ""Citizenship is my family's right"".
""Those who started the petition, unfortunately, did not approach us,"" said Soubh, spokesperson for the coalition.
""They're calling for the abolishment of law, which is not exactly possible. As a coalition, we spent several years researching the issue's legality and ways in which we can actively campaign towards a solution - and what we have come to now is the far-fetched possibility of amending Article 6 of the Constitution,"" Soubh explained.
Implemented in 1954, the Jordanian nationality law defines nationality first through a ""blood bond"", derived from the father's citizenship to those born to Jordanian fathers and foreign mothers.
However, the same rights are denied when a mother is Jordanian and the father a foreign national.
Government figures estimate that approximately 89,000 Jordanian women are married to non-Jordanians. In those cases, the husband is usually Palestinian, Egyptian, Syrian, or Iraqi.
About 360,000 children, therefore, remain without citizenship.
""We called for two things - amending the law, which in reality does not even mention women, rendering it unconstitutional based on its biased nature,"" said Soubh, explaining that Article 6 of the Constitution stipulates that Jordanians have equal rights and duties before the law.
""We wanted to approach the constitutional court and ask for an explanation to the word Jordanian – is it male, female, or both?"" she added. ""And another idea was to ask for an amendment, to add the word gender – so as not to discriminate on the basis of race, religion, or gender.""
The demands of the coalition were refused last year, but Soubh says they are determined to continue their fight.
""This fight has been ongoing for decades,"" said Soubh. ""We have to better strategize and reevaluate our next steps at this point…We have always been told, that this is a matter of a top-down approach.""
Khaled Ramadan, a Jordanian parliamentarian who worked alongside the coalition and pushed to move the debate forward since taking office in 2016, told Al Jazeera: ""It all goes back to the Constitution"".
""When I was a member of the royal dialogue committee, we proposed to amend Article 6 of the Constitution to include the word gender - but this was completely refused,"" he said.
The Jordanian National Charter, introduced in 1990 with the objective of progressing to ""democracy on a stable foundation"" has been adopted by all of the country's ministries, ""is not in equal par to the constitution,"" says Ramadan.
""Though an article in the charter stipulates that Jordanians, whether male or female, are equal in front of the law- the charter is not constitutional and thus cannot be used as a legal basis to change the reality on the ground,"" he explained.
According to Ramadan, the charter formed the basis for the movement and the campaign, which has thus far managed to obligate the government to offer an alternative solution.
In 2014, Jordan's government passed a bill that entitles foreigners with Jordanian mothers in the country to ""service-related privileges"".
Provided that their mothers have been residing in Jordan for at least five years, children of foreign fathers have the right to free high school education and health services in government hospitals, second priority, after Jordanian citizens in all professions, and exemption from any work permit fees.
The bill also allows them to own property, make investments and obtain a driving license. It is also intended to offer temporary residency permits, subject to yearly renewal.
But Ramadan says the privileges available in reality are just 10 percent of what was promised, and these are not guaranteed by law.
Born to a Jordanian mother and Egyptian father, 27-year-old Ahmed al-Araby says he lives the nightmare of being born to a Jordanian mother and ""foreign"" father on a daily basis.
After spending thousands on his education to fulfil his dream of becoming a civil engineer, al-Araby says he now works as a sales representative in a private firm and has not been able to find a job elsewhere.
""Ever since I turned 18, I've been trying to live a dignified life,"" he told Al Jazeera. ""And this still hasn't happened because I don't even have a national identification number.""
Earlier this month, al-Araby's bank accounts were frozen without warning. He was told to provide his bank with a work permit, a task he thought was easy to accomplish.
""I told them (labour ministry) I had the privilege card, and I gave them my university degree. They said they cannot issue me a work permit with engineering as my occupation - instead, they wanted to put me down as a labour worker, but I refused,"" he said.
""The so-called 'privileges card', which lacks a national identification number, is not even recognisable by police officers and public sector employees,"" he added. ""
Ahmed al-Araby
How are they supposed to take me seriously anywhere in this country?""
Similarly, campaign coordinator Rami Al Wakeel, said that nothing has changed in reality.
""Investments need a lot of capital, and still have to be administered by a Jordanian national,"" said Wakeel.
""Only 66,000 people received these privileges cards, while 6,000 applicants were rejected due to the strict conditions that are in place,"" he added. ""You can't even use these cards to open bank accounts. You can't even donate blood to your own mother without a proper identification number in this country.""
To obtain work permits, foreigners with Jordanian mothers are treated as expatriates, said Wakeel.
""The bureaucracy involved is complex and endless,"" he said.
As a result, most of the affected people, like al-Araby, end up working in the private sector where almost no official paperwork is involved.
Even if a permit is granted, it is ""only valid for one year - and could be rejected on basis that a Jordanian national needs the job instead"", said Wakeel.
According to parliamentarian Ramadan, the ""least complicated"" option being explored is for legislators in the Senate to call on the constitutional court for an in-depth explanation of what the term ""Jordanian"" means in Article 6.
However, most of the Senate's members are not ""socially mature"" enough to take this step on behalf of the NGOs and affected people, he explained, and for such a move to materialise, it would require extensive pressure from the public.
Traditionally, arguments that go against the call for equal nationality rights are often attributed to the large presence of Palestinian refugees in the country. Thus, legislators argued that granting Jordanian citizenship to children of Palestinian fathers could have changed the country's demographic.
Today, with the inflow of Iraqi and Syrian refugees, Jordan hosts more than 2.5 million refugees. This, says Ramadan, is going to ""make the fight even harder"".

State election officials citing results from 99.9 percent of polling stations on Saturday said Babis' anti-corruption and anti-euro ANO (Yes) movement won with 29.7 percent support, almost three times higher than any other party and giving it a chance to rule with just one partner in a coalition.
ANO was followed by the eurosceptic right-wing ODS party on 11.3 percent.
The far-right, anti-EU and anti-Islam SPD party made strong gains, capturing more than 10 percent of the vote, while another protest party, the Pirates, was set to win a number of seats by appealing to unhappy liberal voters.
At just 7.4 percent, the ruling Social Democrats of Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka were on course for their worst result since the country peacefully split with Slovakia in 1993.
In all, a record nine parties were set to win seats. Turnout was at 60 percent.
ANO is the first party to break a quarter century of dominance by two mainstream centre-right and centre-left parties, highlighting a shifting political landscape in Europe where a refugee crisis has given rise to protest groups.
The Czech economy has enjoyed rapid growth, a balanced budget and the lowest unemployment in the European Union in the past four years, but the Social Democrats - who led a government with ANO and another partner - were not able to capitalise.
Instead, ANO and other protest groups took advantage of voters' discontent by promising to weed out corruption, fight deeper EU integration and resist Brussels trying to impose quotas for taking in refugees.
Babis - dubbed the ""Czech Trump"", a reference to the US president - has promised to bring a businessman's touch to government.
The 63-year-old ran a campaign on opposition to refugee immigration and against closer EU integration.
He maintained his popularity despite facing fraud charges and accusations of conflicts of interest related to his businesses.
ANO is likely to first turn to the Social Democrats for a coalition, its deputy chairman Jaroslav Faltynek told reporters.
However, the Social Democrats' acting chairman said the party may move to the opposition.
Complicating any coalition talks are police charges that Babis illegally received a 2 million euro ($2.35m) EU subsidy when he ran his food, agriculture and chemical empire, worth an estimated $4bn, before entering politics.
He has denied wrongdoing, but party leaders before the election said it would be hard to be part of a cabinet that includes Babis facing a fraud investigation.
His holdings, including interests in national newspapers and a radio station, were placed in a trust earlier this year.
Babis' swipes at Brussels play well with eurosceptic Czechs but he also praises EU membership and does not share the relatively illiberal ideology seen in governments in Hungary and Poland.
Czech President Milos Zeman has said he would allow a month for negotiations before calling a new parliament, the trigger for the current administration to depart. By custom, he asks someone to lead talks before appointing a prime minister.
He told online news website parlamentnilisty.cz he would not object to Babis forming a government even while battling police charges. He also said he would have no objections to talks involving SPD or the Communists.

""One customer looked me in my face and said, 'I can't wait until this man becomes president so he can kick all the Muslims out of this country and stop all of them from coming in,'"" Ali recalled.
""The first thing that came to my mind was that I wouldn't be able to go visit my family in other countries or that they would never be able to come here,"" she told Al Jazeera.
On Wednesday, Ali joined several hundred activists in Washington, DC, to protest the Trump administration's latest attempt to bar various individuals from Chad, Iran, Libya, North Korea, Somalia, Syria and Venezuela.
Chanting ""No ban, no wall, human rights for all!"" protesters gathered in Lafayette Square, next to the White House, for speeches from campaign leaders before marching to the Trump International Hotel .
The demonstration, dubbed #NoMuslimBanEver, was organised by a coalition of immigration and civil rights organisations.
Carrying signs and American flags, many protesters told Al Jazeera that the administration's succession of travel bans had affected them personally.
Yusuf Muse, a US citizen who emigrated from Somalia in 1991, said that he had not seen his parents in 27 years.
After sponsoring them to come to the US, Muse decided to postpone the reunion until the government stopped trying to shut down travel from Somalia.
""It's very upsetting,"" Muse said. ""Sometimes, I don't sleep.""
Organisers had planned the march for Wednesday, the day that the third version of the president's travel ban was scheduled to go into effect.
The event turned more hopeful than expected, however, after a federal judge in Hawaii on Tuesday temporarily halted the administration from implementing most of the restrictions.
A second similar injunction was issued earlier on Wednesday by a federal judge in Maryland.
Linda Sarsour, a prominent civil rights activist and one of the event organisers, welcomed the ruling but cautioned against complacency.
""I love Hawaii, but for me, it was a small battle won in the larger war that we're in right now to protect immigrant communities, Muslims and refugees,"" Sarsour told Al Jazeera.
""We can't just celebrate and go home. We have to stay out fighting, and that's why we're here today rallying in Washington, DC.""
Unlike the administration's first two executive orders, Trump's latest travel ban was indefinite.
In an effort to strengthen the measure against legal challenge, the administration included country-by-country specifications for which citizens would be barred from entry.
The ruling by Judge Derrick K Watson in Hawaii halts only the restriction on travel from Muslim-majority nations, allowing the restrictions on Venezuela and North Korea to move ahead.
Advocates argued that Venezuela and North Korea had been added to obfuscate what remained at heart a Muslim ban.
""They just threw these countries in to balance out allegations that this is a Muslim ban,"" said Zahra Billoo, executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) in San Francisco and the Bay Area.
""If you look at the impact on travellers from North Korea and Venezuela, it's so small,"" she told Al Jazeera.
""One, there weren't that many people coming from North Korea on immigrant visas, to begin with, and for Venezuela, the ban is limited to … government officials and their family members.""
The Trump administration contends that the ban targets the eight countries for failing to provide enough information to vet prospective travellers.
Watson's ruling ""undercuts the President's efforts to keep the American people safe and enforce minimum security standards for entry into the United States,"" the White House said in a statement on Tuesday.
The administration announced that it will appeal the ruling, and activists, including Henrike Dessaules, communications director for the International Refugee Assistance Project, say they know they are in for a long legal fight.
""We will continue to litigate against this ban and any other versions of it that violate the rights of Muslims, refugees or immigrants,"" Dessaules said.

It gained independence in 2011 with the strong support of the Bush and Obama administrations.
But in 2013, civil war broke out between forces loyal to President Salva Kiir and supporters of his former deputy, Riek Machar, who are known as the rebels. While both sides have been accused of atrocities, the UN says the majority have been committed by government soldiers.
A peace deal brokered by the US and the international community collapsed in July 2016.
Until the summer of 2016, South Sudan’s Yei region was a leafy oasis in the midst of the country’s civil war. But when a national peace deal broke down, and government soldiers ransacked the area, a handful of UN and US officials begged their leaders for help.
They argued that the UN must send peacekeepers to Yei to protect civilians from Kiir’s forces, who were burning villages and slaughtering men, women and children. And that the US needs to change its approach in the face of a potential genocide, they warned.
The pleas were ignored. The UN did not send peacekeeping troops to Yei, and the US continued to support South Sudan’s military, possibly in violation of US law, an AP investigation found.
The investigation is based on more than 30 internal or confidential documents from the UN, White House and US Department of State, as well as dozens of interviews with current or former officials and civilians.
In a matter of weeks, Yei became the centre of a nationwide campaign of what the UN calls ethnic cleansing, which created the largest exodus of civilians in Africa since the Rwandan genocide in 1994. More than 1 million people have now fled to Uganda, mostly from the Yei region. And while there is no tally for how many people have died in South Sudan, estimates put the number in the tens or even hundreds of thousands.
Kate Almquist Knopf, director at the Africa Center for Strategic Studies at the US Department of Defense, compared the situation in South Sudan to Rwanda, where nearly a million people died in 100 days with little action from the US or the international community.
“The same thing is happening now in South Sudan,” she said. “It’s happening on Africa’s watch. It’s happening on America’s watch. It’s happening on the United Nations’ watch.”
More than a year later, the UN says it is still considering sending a permanent peacekeeping force to Yei if it gets more troops. The UN now has about 12,000 peacekeepers throughout South Sudan, but US officials say it would take roughly 40,000 to secure the country. That leaves Yei and other major population centres - such as Bentiu, Malakal and Wau - vulnerable.
“There are always discussions,” said Daniel Dickinson, a spokesperson for the U.N. mission in South Sudan. “It’s all about what resources the mission has available.”
For its part, the US had budgeted $30 million for technical training, non-lethal equipment and advisers to South Sudan’s military for the 2016 and 2017 fiscal years. The State Department in July gave a further $2 million for a military and security operations centre that supported the country’s security service and presidential guards.
The assistance appears to violate a US law prohibiting support to any unit that has committed a gross violation of human rights - in this case including an attack on a popular hotel that targeted aid workers and American citizens. South Sudanese soldiers have killed a journalist, gang raped women and conducted mock executions of civilians and aid workers.
A spokesperson for the State Department said military officials who received assistance “were vetted and not credibly implicated in the gross violation of human rights.” They added the US had exerted pressure on both the government and the rebels to stop fighting.
However, the US aid is a “red flag,” said Sen. Patrick Leahy, who sponsored the law. “The South Sudanese security forces, like their rebel counterparts, are notorious for violating human rights without fear of being punished. We do not want the United States to be associated with such misconduct.”
In 2016, government troops rampaged through the town of Nyori in the Yei region, according to a former local official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he feared retribution. He ran into the bush to hide and returned three days later to carnage.
“I witnessed with my own eyes, young children, they were slaughtered,” he said.
Rose Kiden fled from a town near Yei when soldiers swarmed her house. In a hushed voice, Kiden recounted how she came back to find her sister on the floor; she had been raped by eight soldiers. Kiden said she knew six other women who were raped by soldiers.
Her husband was killed by government troops when he went to collect food. But even as the violence near Yei spread, Kiden said, UN vehicles drove by without stopping.
“They didn’t do anything,” Kiden said, as she held her baby, who now has no father. “They just passed.”
When UN officials visited Yei in September 2016, they were horrified by stories of women gang raped and a baby hacked with a machete.
“If the security situation is not rapidly stabilized, the protection crisis in Yei will swiftly become a multi-faceted humanitarian crisis,” said a UN report from September 15, obtained by AP, to the head of the UN mission in South Sudan at the time, Ellen Loj.
After nearly two months, the UN started sending small, temporary patrols to Yei. But both residents and UN officials said the violence merely continued after the blue helmets left. In late October 2016, a UN patrol remained on the ground for only three days.
In November, the AP saw seven corpses inside a hut, where local officials said people had been arrested, trapped and burned alive. One charred body was slouched against a wall with its arms and legs missing, and another lacked a torso.
On November 11, special adviser Adama Dieng warned about “the potential for genocide” and highlighted the violence in Yei.
“One person reported desperately to me, ‘Tonight I don’t know what will happen to me,’” Dieng said at the time.
That month, the UN decided not to send a permanent force to Yei. When asked why at her farewell press conference on November 28, Loj said the UN did not have enough troops. She said Yei would be next to get peacekeepers.
“But I don’t know when it will be possible,” she added. “South Sudan is a big country, and we cannot have a soldier behind each and every South Sudanese.”
In the meantime, South Sudan’s government blocked or harassed UN officials dozens of times per month, according to confidential UN documents. UN officials told the AP that the mission should have sent peacekeepers into Yei anyway.
“This is what the peacekeepers were there for,” said Donatella Rovera, a crisis adviser at Amnesty International. “There was a failure to do what needed to be done at the time it needed to be done.”
During another UN visit in February this year, a community leader from the Yei area said he had begged for peacekeepers three times in the past few weeks.
“We need imminent protection before it’s too late,” he said, according to an internal report. “If we get killed because we told you the truth today so be it.”
Hours later the UN left.
The South Sudan government has denied ethnic cleansing and human rights violations.
“All these reports that go to the UN are written by individuals who are anti-peace in South Sudan,” said Minister of Information Michael Makuei.
The US also struggled to respond to the crisis in South Sudan, according to documents and interviews.
In July 2016, the South Sudanese military fired dozens of bullets into two US embassy vehicles. The same month, government troops rampaged through a hotel, killing a journalist, gang raping women and beating people, including Americans.
Still, the US continued to believe it could fix South Sudan’s military. In September, President Barack Obama sought a “long-term military to military relationship” with South Sudan, according to a letter to Congress obtained by AP. The letter, which allowed military training and education for South Sudan’s army, circumvented a law blocking US support for countries that use child soldiers.
“Once again in South Sudan, we have shown a pattern of having bad analysis, either ignoring the symptoms of the problem entirely, not seeing them, or analysing them in the wrong way,” said Cameron Hudson, director of African affairs at the National Security Council in the Bush administration.
One State Department official was more blunt.
“We just don’t have a policy,” said the official, who asked to remain anonymous because he was not authorised to speak to reporters. “There is no game plan.”
The centrepiece of the US response to South Sudan was a push for an additional 4,000-strong UN peacekeeping force to protect civilians under attack. The US got the force approved by the Security Council. At a press conference in South Sudan in September 2016, Samantha Power, then US ambassador to the UN, described an agreement with President Kiir on the extra 4,000 peacekeepers, known as the Regional Protection Force.
“We came to get consent to the RPF, and that is a consent that has been given,” said Power, the Pulitzer Prize-winning author of a book that details America’s failure to prevent genocide in Germany, Rwanda and the Balkans. “The details have to be worked through.” If the government didn’t accept the troops, Power warned, the Security Council would place an arms embargo on the country.
But in a stark reversal, as Power left the next morning, South Sudan’s government denied having ever accepted the extra 4,000 peacekeepers.
“I think the government won the game,” South Sudanese Cabinet Minister Martin Lomuro bragged to reporters.
One State Department official described Power’s visit as “supremely embarrassing” because of the public failure. Others doubted that she was fooled by South Sudan’s leaders. Power declined requests for comment.
In the fall, a dissent cable drafted within the State Department argued that US support for the peace deal and failure to act was fueling violence.
“Further calamity is likely; the risks of famine, continued mass atrocities, and genocide are among the highest in the world,” the draft cable said. The risks of not changing US policy, it continued, “are immediate and unacceptably high.” The draft was never finalised because it did not gain enough support, two US officials said.
Senior Obama administration officials said pulling out of the country’s peace deal would have created even more violence, and there was a limit to what the US could accomplish without partners in the African Union.
Others disagree. The US gave “tacit endorsement” to South Sudan’s government, according to Alan Boswell, a researcher on South Sudan.
US policy “did not start the violence, but it meant that we were not going to try and stop it,” Boswell said.
Today, more than 18,000 homes have been destroyed in Yei, UN satellite images show.
Yei is in danger of famine. Hundreds of people have died, and many more have fled, creating the world’s largest refugee camp in Uganda, Bidi Bidi. Government forces attacked some even as they tried to escape.
“When women went to collect food at farms, the soldiers raped people, raping everyone,” said Simon Nigo, a refugee at Bidi Bidi. “No protection for the civilians.”
A pastor from Yei, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution from South Sudanese intelligence officials, came to Bidi Bidi after the military took over the orphanage he ran. He said the charred bodies the AP discovered in the burned house on the outskirts of Yei were his relatives.
His bible is inscribed with the word “Redemption,” promising revenge. Like others at Bidi Bidi, he said he felt abandoned by the UN and the world.
“They could have protected people’s lives,” he said. “They could have saved us from coming to this camp.”

The state government of Lower Saxony passed a decree last week instructing migration offices to prevent immigration to Salzgitter, citing the northern city's ""exceptionally high immigration"" and ""for reasons of integration"".
""This is an exceptional measure aimed at preventing the social and societal exclusion of immigrant refugees,"" said the mandate by the state's interior ministry.
Under the state order, refugees will need proof of employment or have close relatives already living in the city to be allowed settlement.
The new decree is based upon a federal law, which officials say is aimed at improving integration.
The UN's refugee agency, UNHCR, criticised the law in a statement last year.
""We are critical of these limitations imposed on this right if they are not based on an individual assessment of the case,"" Roland Bank, officer-in-charge of the German representation of UNHCR, told Al Jazeera in an email on Monday.
""We have underlined the general right to the freedom of choice of residency of recognised refugees as laid down in the Geneva Refugee Convention (Article 26).""
Located in the southeast of Lower Saxony, Salzgitter has a population of more than 100,000.
Around 5,800 refugees currently live in the city, according to Mayor Franck Klingebiel.
Sascha Schissel, policy adviser at the NGO Refugee Council of Lower Saxony, said the decree is a ""setback"" to resettlement and ""only adds to the obstacles refugees already face in Germany"".
""This measure is an unnecessary infringement of refugee rights and a bureaucratic folly which will have no positive effect on the challenges concerning integration in Salzgitter, whatsoever,"" Schissel told Al Jazeera. ""Integration and participation of refugees will now be more hampered than before.""
Many refugees still live in camps in Lower Saxony because they are unable to find accommodation.
""Integration and participation can only be successful when refugees are able to live in their own flats and lead a self-determined life,"" said Schissel.
The development in northern Germany comes as Chancellor Angela Merkel's open-door policy for refugees draws fierce criticism from her detractors.
Merkel's centre-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU) party suffered defeat to the Social Democrats (SDP) in Lower Saxony's state election on Sunday.
The ban in Salzgitter also comes amid the rise of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, which established itself as the country’s third biggest political force in last month's general election.
The emergence of the anti-refugee and anti-Muslim party in the parliament has worried many asylum seekers in the country.
There is also concern that after Salzgitter, more restrictions of movement in Lower Saxony might take place in the near future.
Schissel said the new measure though small is a ""striking example for symbolic politics"".

While hundreds of thousands of Rohingya escape into Bangladesh fleeing what UN calls ""textbook ethnic cleansing"" in Myanmar hoping for a better life, there is an exodus of Bangladeshis who feel salvation lies elsewhere.
Experts warn with slowdown of the rate of poverty reduction in recent years, slower growth in agriculture, a drop in remittances, lack of job opportunities, wealth inequality and challenges of reaching the hard-to-reach poor people, the Rohingya refugee crisis will push more disaffected Bangladeshis to attempt risky journeys in a bid to make their fortunes elsewhere.
Like Hossain, tens of thousands are travelling from the South Asian nation to Libya to make the perilous boat trip to Italy.
""I was excited that within hours we would be in Italy. All my family's financial troubles will be over. I thought I could now prove myself worthy to my paralysed father,""
Instead, many are sold as slaves before they even reach port, and those that do secure a boat - like Hossain's young cousin - may not survive the journey.
""I am consumed by guilt,"" said Hossain, who has returned, broken, to Bangladesh.
""I will have to live with his death for the rest of my life,"" he added.
More than 100 people squeezed into the tiny boat he and his cousin Farid took from Libya to Italy, many were Africans, but there were dozens from Hossain's hometown of Beanibazar, as well as elsewhere across the country.
Three hours after the 30-foot (10-metre) plastic vessel had set off from Libya, it broke down and started to sink.
There was ""panic"", Hossain recounted. One Bangladeshi youth was crushed to death in the rush and other passengers jumped into the sea, never to be seen again.
Several emptied cans of petrol on the boat floor so they could use the containers to float in the water.
""Our feet burned when they dipped in the petrol,"" he explained, adding that Farid jumped into the sea to escape the burning.
The teenager saw a ship on the horizon and attempted to swim for help, but did not survive.
""I saw his lifeless body floating,"" Hossain recalled.
More than 2,700 people have died attempting to cross the Mediterranean so far this year, according to the UN, with Bangladeshis top of the list of people rescued.
Hossain plucked from the sea by a Libyan gang and spent three months in the war-torn nation working as a slave on construction sites.
He says he was sold at least three times. His father, severely debilitated after a stroke, paid $12,000 in total to secure his release.
Hossain recalled: ""We were tortured. Many were raped and sodomised at gunpoint.""
Bangladesh's population has soared in recent years and despite reasonable growth over the past decade, opportunities for work are limited.
The number of Bangladeshis on the Libya-to-Italy route has risen from a few dozen in 2014 to about 11,000 from June 2016 to March this year, according to official figures, though some estimates put the figure as high as 30,000.
In Beanibazar alone, an estimated 1,000 young men have made the $10,000 journey in the past year, council chairman Ataur Rahman Khan told AFP.
""Young men are desperate to go to Italy via Libya. Fathers are borrowing money and mothers are selling heirlooms to pay the traffickers,"" Khan said.
The situation may worsen as the arrival of more than half a million Rohingya refugees who have fled an army crackdown in Myanmar's troubled Rakhine State since puts an immense strain on Bangladesh's resources.
Authorities have allocated a huge swath of land in the country's southeast in an effort to confine some 800,000 Rohingya into a settlement set to be the world's largest refugee camp.
Migration expert Jalal Uddin Sikder told AFP that if authorities ""failed to find a solution"" to the refugee crisis, then the situation would ""fuel"" the exodus out if Bangladesh.
Sikder added traffickers use rare success stories of migrants who have reached Europe to lure tens of thousands of others to follow suit.
He explained: ""They sell stories of success to jobless youths, causing enormous peer pressure in families. One or two deaths at sea or reports of kidnappings just don't matter any more.""

https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/10/sebastian-kurz-europe-youngest-leader-171016124645623.html,refugee,896,Tue Oct 17 2017 09:57:01 GMT+0000,None,"Who is Sebastian Kurz, Europe's youngest leader?","Who are the world's youngest leaders?
At 31 years old, Sebastian Kurz is set to become the world's youngest leader.
The conservative People's Party (OVP) leader is poised to be the new Chancellor of Austria. Despite his young age, he already has significant political experience.
According to projections, OVP won around 30 percent of the vote.
In 2013, he was appointed Europe's youngest-ever foreign minister. At 27 years old, he hosted talks between Iran, the United States, China, Russia, Germany, France and the UK on the nuclear deal. In 2015, the landmark agreement was signed in Vienna.
He has steered the OVP further to the right. During the refugee crisis, he called for stricter border controls in Europe to discourage refugees from fleeing to Europe. He introduced laws preventing foreign organisations from financially supporting Austrian mosques, and said Muslims in the country should only be allowed government-approved German language Qurans. And he backed the ""burka ban"", which prevents people from wearing a veil that covers the face in public.
In essence, Kurz has positioned the OVP close to the far-right Freedom Party of Austria (FPO).
Refugees, he has promised, would not be allowed to receive benefits from the state unless they have lived in Austria for five years.
Before the October 15 election, he vowed to halt the influx of people fleeing war and persecution.
The OVP party is expected to rule with either the far-right FPO or the centre-left Social Democratic Party of Austria.
Kurz's was an eager member of the OVP's youth wing. Having helped the party grow, he rose through the ranks all the way to foreign minister.
At his own request, his portfolio would include managing integration. This led to him introduce the so-called ""Islam Act"" in 2015, which put restrictions on foreign money supporting Austrian mosques in an attempt to curb a rise in so-called ""political Islam"".
Kurz has been likened to other young, charismatic leaders such as Emmanuel Macron of France and Justin Trudeau of Canada. However, Kurz's politics overall are far more right-wing than the mostly liberal agendas of his French and Canadian counterparts.
In May 2017, Kurz was appointed as acting party leader of the OVP after the unexpected resignation of Reinhold Mitterlehner. Two months later, Kurz was officially elected as party leader, and the party quickly rose from the third spot in the polls to winning elections.
Kurz has worked towards creating a new, right-wing image that uses moderate language in an attempt to appeal to both left-wing and far-right voters.
He rebranded the party, renaming it ""The New People's Party"" while campaigning that it was ""time for something new"".
His main campaign message was to stop illegal immigration into Austria. As foreign minister, he played an important role in 2016 in closing down the Balkan route for refugees flowing into Europe.
During a campaign rally, Kurz said: ""I can also promise today that we will end illegal migration to ensure more order and security in Austria.""
He wants to slash unemployment benefits for asylum seekers and workers from the EU, and reduce government's aid to refugees. He also promised to stop tax increases.
During the campaign, Kurz beat the increasingly popular far right at its own game.
""The OVP is usually seen as a centre-right party, but it has taken over some of the arguments and issues from the FPO and presented them in a more moderate way,"" Anton Pelinka, a professor of nationalism studies at the Central European University, told Al Jazeera. ""The style is different but the substance is not.""
Concerned.
""What happens after this election result is important,"" Carla Amina Baghajati, spokeswoman for the Austrian Islamic Religious Authority, told Al Jazeera.
""Anti-Islamic propaganda ... very much fuelled this election campaign. This is an opportunity to leave the emotional way behind us and get into a more pragmatic dialogue.
""We should be concerned about this result, but nevertheless, we should also be aware that our democracy is strong and our constitution protects us.""
Kurz will now have to form a coalition with either the FPO or SPO, meaning Austria could take a turn further to the right or it could go back to the status quo of a OVP/SPO government.
Not all votes have been counted, and it is unclear as of yet which will be the second-biggest party. However, polling before the election showed the far-right FPO as the big favourite to join Kurz's OVP in a coalition government.
The two parties formed a government between 2000 and 2007, leading to European sanctions because of the FPO's far-right views.
""People aren't afraid of sanctions any more. It was an exceptional situation then, [but] now we have a completely different political environment, not only in Austria but in almost all European countries, there is a big right-wing presence in politics,"" Christoph Prantner, a senior editor at Austria's Der Standard newspaper, told Al Jazeera. ""We have moved to a new normality when it comes to these kinds of issues.""
Although the OVP and the SPO have a long history of ruling the country, one of the reasons the OVP is successful because it has moved away from the SPO and moved closer towards the far-right.
""People are sick and tired of the grand coalition government, and the FPO put their fingers on issues people cared about during this election,"" Pranther said.

Polls will close at 6pm local time (16:00 GMT) on Sunday, but the counting of the ballots will not start until Monday.
The vote could see Sebastian Kurz, a young conservative politician, beat the far right at its own game by adopting a hard line on refugees and pledging to prevent a repeat of Europe's migration crisis.
The ballot, however, is widely expected to result in a coalition government featuring Austria's far-right Freedom Party (FPO), which is predicted to win up to 26 percent of the vote.
The election will be watched closely across the European Union, as the bloc seeks stability in the wake of the UK's Brexit vote last year and a far-right surge in September's German elections.
Austria's election arrived almost a year earlier than expected, following a breakdown of the country's grand coalition government in May.
The Social Democratic Party (SPO) and the conservative People's Party (OVP) agreed on early elections with all other parliamentary parties after months of inertia caused by policy disputes and internal wrangling in the OVP.
Kurz - the OVP's leader since May 14, two days after early elections were announced - has galvanised the party's electoral prospects by promising to revive Austria's political system, which is geared towards an SPO and OVP coalition government.
The parties have governed Austria together for 44 of the last 72 years following the creation of a national unity government in 1945, a decade before Austria gained full independence from Germany.
Kurz, who is only 31, has built his popularity by adopting many of the FPO's mantras, making this an election defined by issues raised by the far right, such as stricter immigration and the role of Islam in Austrian society.
""I can also promise today that we will end illegal migration to ensure more order and security in Austria,"" Kurz said at one of his campaign rallies.
""Austria is one of the best off countries in Europe, but people want change anyway,"" Christoph Prantner, a senior editor of Austria's Der Standard newspaper opinion pages, told Al Jazeera.
""People are sick and tired of the grand coalition government, and the FPO put their finger on issues people cared about during this election,"" he said.
The FPO were polling in first place among Austrian voters during much of the past year.
Heinz-Christian Strache, leader of the FPO, has said that he thinks Islam does not belong in Austria and that he ""does not want an Islamisation of his homeland"".
OVP is the clear favourite to finish first in Sunday's poll. The party is projected to win up to 33 percent of the vote, according to opinion polls.
Christian Kern's left-leaning SPO is set to compete with the FPO for the second place, with both predicted to win around 25 percent of the vote.
With no party expected to win a clear majority, the most likely outcome appears to be a coalition government led by the OVP with the support of the FPO.
Such an outcome would place the FPO in government for the first time in more than a decade.
Their last period at the helm of Austrian politics, spanning from 2000-2007, prompted other members of the European Union to impose sanctions in an attempt to ostracise the country.
There will be no repeat of that action from the bloc should the FPO win its way back into government, Prantner said.
""People aren't afraid of sanctions any more. It was an exceptional situation then, [but] now we have a completely different political environment, not only in Austria but in almost all European countries, there is a big right-wing presence in politics,"" he told Al Jazeera.
""We have moved to a new normality when it comes to these kinds of issues.""
Unlike some other far-right parties across Europe, the FPO has been part of Austria's political scene for a number of decades.
""The FPO has been around for 60 years, it's a well-established third party,"" Cas Mudde, a political scientist at the University of Georgia, told Al Jazeera.
""So if people aren't happy with Austria's grand coalition the natural decision, assuming they're on the right of the political spectrum, is to vote for the FPO party.""
Despite the break-up of Austria's grand coalition government, the FPO appears to have declined in popularity from a year ago, when they were comfortably leading in opinion polls.
However, it has had a substantial effect on this election, even before voting takes place.
Anton Pelinka, a professor of nationalism studies at the Central European University, said the FPO has managed to shift the OVP significantly to the right.
""The OVP is usually seen as a centre-right party, but it has taken over some of the arguments and issues from the FPO and presented them in a more moderate way,"" he told Al Jazeera.
""The style is different but the substance is not.""
Exiting the European Union, however, remains off the agenda for the FPO and OVP, according to Pelinka, despite an apparent rise in support a far-right approach characterised by anti-immigration and nationalistic rhetoric.
""There is no possibility that Austria will leave the EU. Not even the FPO would ask for that,"" he told Al Jazeera.
""But Austria may move within the EU towards the positions adopted by Poland and Hungary on a more restrictive immigration policy, and oppose further deepening of the EU.""
Around 15 percent of Austria's 8.7 million citizens were born abroad, according to Eurostat. Almost 10 percent, or 765,000, of those originate from outside the EU bloc.
Austria recently banned the face veil, leading some Muslims to feel marginalised and scared for their position in the country.
""I am afraid to be living in a country where the women are suppressed because of their headscarves or what they are wearing, their exteriors. I am afraid of that because I want to become a doctor,"" Austrian voter Meri Mohammed told Al Jazeera.
The issues defining the Austrian election mirror discussions currently permeating the EU.
The rise of the far right, immigration, EU reform and the role of Islam in society have all featured prominently in a number of elections within the bloc.
""The Austrian election is representative of the changes and challenges Europe has to face,"" Pelinka told Al Jazeera.
In particular, the rise of far-right parties within the EU has challenged established political systems and the bloc's vision of deeper integration.
Such parties also pose a challenge to the democratic foundations underpinning the entire EU project, Mudde told Al Jazeera.
""These parties don't realign people, they have instead created a de-alignment. They've helped to loosen ties between the electorate and established political parties … these far-right parties fundamentally stand for a system that is not liberal democratic,"" he said.
""Assuming liberal democracy is the norm, this is problematic. Because these parties want to undermine minority rights, and the rule of law, the FPO included""
Austria uses a proportional representation voting system to elect candidates to the country's 183 National Council seats.
A party must win at least four percent of the vote nationwide to win a seat in parliament, or at least one seat in one of Austria's 43 regional electoral districts.
Elections are held every five years, unless all parliamentary parties agree to a premature dissolution of parliament to hold an early vote.
Austrians aged 16 years and or older are permitted to vote, after the national voting age was lowered from 18 in 2007. In total, Austria has about 6.4 million registered voters.
Separate elections for Austria's presidency are held every six years. The last presidential election took place on December 4, 2016, when Green Party politician Alexander Van Der Bellen held off a challenge from FPO candidate Norbert Hofer to win the vote.

District forest official Mohammed Ali Kabir said a herd of elephants entered the Balukhali camp in Ukhiya town early on Saturday and trampled tents where several refugees were sleeping.
Kabir said that four other people were injured in the attack and many others fled to safety.
At the refugee camp, cooking utensils the family had brought from Myanmar lay crushed under a jumble of bamboo sticks and clothes.
Many trees on the forested hills of Balukhali in southern Bangladesh have been chopped down to house the massive influx of ethnic Rohingya escaping violence in neighbouring Myanmar.
Tarpaulin and bamboo shelters have been built on elephant walkways in some areas, sparking environmental concerns, as the country struggles to accommodate an unprecedented number of people.
It was the third attack by wild elephants on the refugees in Bangladesh's Cox's Bazar district, which borders Myanmar. At least seven people died in the two previous attacks.
Abdul Sukoor, 30, whose tent on the edge of the camp was also trampled, said he and his family managed to escape when they heard the screams of other refugees as the elephants approached.
He is now moving to a tent further inside the camp, but said he was still worried. ""We have to be constantly alert at night,"" he said.
More than 530,000 refugees from Myanmar have fled to Bangladesh over the last two months since attacks by Rohingya militia on security posts triggered a Myanmar army operation that the United Nations has described as ethnic cleansing.

Opinion polls place the party in second place with as much as 27 percent of the vote, just six points behind the conservative frontrunners, the Austrian People's Party.
The vote comes just weeks after the far-right Alternative for Germany party made record gains in the German parliamentary election last month.
Its anti-immigrant, anti-Islam platform won it 94 seats in the Bundestag, making it the third-largest party in the country.
Al Jazeera spoke to political scientist Cas Mudde about policy, populism, and far-right parties in Austria, and more broadly in Europe.
Al Jazeera: Is far-right populism surging in popularity in Europe?
Cas Mudde: The far right isn't really surging, at least not compared to 2016. Whenever we talk about a comeback, or rise, it depends on the timeframe.
Every single populist radical right party peaked in the polls in the latter half of 2016, and scored lower after.
If you compare the situation now to three months ago, yes - the Alternative for Germany (AfD) went up in the polls and the FPO are going back up. But, that has a very simple explanation. When elections are about the radical right, or issues they are broadly associated with, such as immigration, or terrorism, they generally tend to do better.
Al Jazeera: What is fuelling the far-right parties?
Mudde: The core of almost all of these parties is nativism, authoritarianism, and populism. The political breeding grounds for all three of these are abundant at the moment given the widespread discussion about the role of Islam (in society) and the refugee crisis in Europe.
Populism feeds off discomfort with the establishment, which has been very high for a while now, following the economic crisis. It's also to do with political parties having less and less space to make decisions, particularly in the EU, because of a strict international framework and globalisation limiting the range of options available to them.
It was largely similar factors which drove many of these parties in the 1990s and they are not going to go away. The debate about immigration and Islam in Western societies is going to be with us for decades to come. Terrorism and populism have become structural within our societies.
Al Jazeera: What is the difference between populism and nativism?
Mudde: The difference between populism and nativism is that populism is all about the concept of pure people set against a corrupt elite.
Nativism, on the other hand, is about the ethnic 'us' and 'them', about wanting a [monocultural] state and seeing alien things and people as threatening.
The populist radical right tends to combine those two approaches, but technically nativism isn't part of populism per se. We've seen examples in Europe of populist parties that are not nativist, such as Podemos in Spain.
Cas Mudde
I personally use the term ""populist radical right"" [when talking about parties such as the AfD and FPO] as it combines their elements of nativist populism and authoritarianism.
We shouldn't just describe parties as ""populist"" when actually we're predominantly focusing on their nativist elements. It's simply incorrect to argue all populist parties are anti-immigration.
But almost all of the successes have been from a very specific part of populism, the populist radical right.
Al Jazeera: What effect do these parties tend to have in Europe?
Mudde: The effect of these parties is very indirect because they are rarely actually in government. As a result, in Europe, they rarely have a seat at the table at the council, they aren't represented in the European Commission, and therefore, are relatively powerless in the EU.
Populist radical right parties are more successful now than ever, but on average, don't get more than 12-15 percent of the vote throughout the EU. Very few of these populist radical right parties have created stable electoral support bases.
But the discourse around them influences other parties. That has been particularly evident since 2015 and, as a result, there's been a debate about whether populist parties represent the spirit of the time and the voice of the people.
More mainstream parties have felt compelled not to push for more integration [because of the influence of the populist radical right] and have instead called for power to be brought back to the nation-state level.
But what is important is that mainstream parties decide the narrative, and if [after her victory in the recent German elections] Merkel can form a domestic coalition that wants to move forward with EU reform she can find a narrative to do that alongside French President Emmanuel Macron.
Al Jazeera: Are populist parties strengthening democracy by widening the political landscape?
Mudde: I think there are positive aspects to bringing non-voters back into the democratic system, as the AfD and some others have done, and there's nothing particularly wrong with liberal democracy just because mainstream parties lose support.
But these parties don't realign people, they have instead created a de-alignment. They've helped to loosen ties between the electorate and established political parties … these far-right parties fundamentally stand for a system that is not liberal democratic.
Assuming liberal democracy is the norm, this is problematic. Because these parties want to undermine minority rights and the rule of law, the FPO included.
Al Jazeera: How is the FPO different from the AfD?
Mudde: The FPO has been around for almost 60 years, it's a well-established third party. So if people aren't happy with Austria's grand coalition the natural decision, assuming they're on the right of the political spectrum, is to vote for the FPO party.
Austria has just had another grand coalition government [between the Social Democratic Party of Austria and the Austrian's People Party], which is always good for protest parties. Two major parties of the centre left and centre right working together allows those on the outside of government to argue the main parties are the same as one another and that ""left"" and ""right"" are all the same.
They are well represented at the state level in various states, and to a certain extent, are a known quantity. They have a number of experienced politicians in their ranks who are pretty smooth operators, such as Norbert Hofer (who contested the Austrian presidential election in 2016).
The FPO is not just a protest party, it is an alternative party. Some voters clearly think ""Let's give them a try in government,"" whereas most people who supported the AfD voted against the German government as a protest.
Very few voted for the AfD hoping they would be part of the next government coalition, but a sizeable portion voting for the FPO will be hoping and expecting the party will be the next partner in Austria's coalition government.
The FPO are less openly anti-EU [compared with the AfD] because Austria has a very pro-European electorate. Being outspoken against the EU would be electoral suicide for the party.
Al Jazeera: What can we expect the FPO to achieve in the upcoming Austrian election?
Mudde: I don't know if the FPO will come second or third, but it really doesn't matter that much.
The most likely outcome is an FPO and Austrian People Party (OVP) coalition government. Whether they come in second or third during the elections, they will still be the junior partner in such a coalition.
Such a government would predominantly represent the OVP manifesto. However, that manifesto, under party leader Sebastian Kurz, has moved significantly towards the one put forward by the FPO.
The biggest effect has been over the last year or so, during which time both parties have moved strongly to the right on immigration, crime, and terrorism.
While Merkel made a few compromises on refugee policy [to counter the growing popularity of the AfD], this is nothing compared to Kurz. Some of his positions are almost identical to the FPO.
The FPO's success in opinion polls has forced him to move right, and this is a very different threat to the one Merkel faced from the AfD. In part, that's because he has always been more right-leaning than Merkel, but it's also because Kurz chose this defence to a much stronger populist radical right challenger in Austria compared to Germany.
To a certain extent, Merkel is the outlier. In [the Netherlands], France and Britain, leaders have shifted more to the right as they seek to counter the political challenges posed by populist radical right parties.

Senior General Min Aung Hlaing gave his most extensive account of the Rohingya refugee crisis in the meeting with American Ambassador Scot Marciel, according to a report posted on his Facebook page on Thursday.
The general is the most powerful person in Buddhist-majority Myanmar and his apparently uncompromising stance would indicate little sensitivity over the crisis, in which more than 500,000 people have fled into neighbouring Bangladesh.
Min Aung Hlaing, referring to Rohingya by the term ""Bengali"", which they regard as derogatory, said British colonialists were responsible for the problem.
""The Bengalis were not taken into the country by Myanmar but by the colonialists,"" he told Marciel, according to the account of the meeting posted on Thursday.
""They are not the natives and the records prove that they were not even called Rohingya but just Bengalis during the colonial period.""
READ MORE: Army offensive aimed at 'preventing' Rohingya return
The UN human rights office said on Wednesday that Myanmar's security forces had brutally driven out half a million Rohingya from northern Rakhine state to Bangladesh, torching their homes, crops and villages to prevent them from returning.
Coordinated Rohingya rebel attacks on some 30 security posts on August 25 sparked a ferocious military response.
The UN rights office said in its report, based on 65 interviews with Rohingya who had arrived in Bangladesh, that abuses had begun before the August 25 attacks and included killings, torture, and the rape of children.
The country's civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi is due to make a speech on television later on Thursday.
She was swept into office last year after winning an election, but the military holds immense power, including exclusive say over security.
""Local Bengalis were involved in the attacks under the leadership of ARSA. That is why they might have fled as they feel insecure,"" Min Aung Hlaing said, referring to the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army fighters.
Min Aung Hlaing, whom rights groups say carries personal responsibility for the crisis, insisted the Rohingya are merely returning to their motherland.
""The native place of Bengalis is really Bengal,"" he said. ""They might have fled to the other country with the same language, race and culture as theirs, assuming they would be safer there.""
FEATURE: The mental health toll of the Rohingya crisis
He said it was an exaggeration to say the number fleeing to Bangladesh was ""very large"", adding that there had been ""instigation and propaganda by using the media from behind the scenes"".
While immigration increased under British rule, historians say Muslim communities were recorded as living in the Rakhine region long before the colonial era.
This week, an AFP reporter on a rare government-steered trip to the conflict-hit Rakhine heard testimony from Rohingya villagers who are scared and fast running out of food.
They said Buddhist villagers are trying to starve them out of their homes.

Go back to your own country,"" a man on the street once yelled at Hussam Al Zaher and his sister Samer, who was donning a hijab.
The two Syrian siblings had been exploring Hussam's new hometown, Hamburg.
Since moving to Germany in October 2015, rebuilding his life from zero has been an uphill battle.
""I think it's fear of the unknown,"" says 29-year-old Al Zaher, referring to the racism he suffers. ""Most people who resent refugees don't really know us.""
While Germany has been the most welcoming European country in accepting large numbers of refugees, recent developments have caused some concern for asylum seekers and rights groups.
In the September federal election, Chancellor Angela Merkel won a fourth term, but her victory was overshadowed as the anti-refugee and anti-Muslim party, Alternative for Germany (AfD), gained 12.6 percent of the vote. The AfD is the first far-right party to enter the Bundestag in post-war Germany.
""I hear a lot about the rise of right-wing extremism in Germany, and it's making me feel uncertain about my future here,"" says Al Zaher.
The journalist fled from Damascus in October 2014.
After a year of toiling for 15 hours a day at a clothing factory in Istanbul, he embarked on the perilous journey that tens of thousands of Syrians made before him.
After crossing the Aegean Sea in an overcrowded boat to Greece, he travelled on the Balkan Route.
Along the way, Al Zaher met fellow weary travellers from Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria, Iran, bound by one ambition: the hope for a better life than the one they left behind.
He is now one of 1.3 million asylum seekers who have arrived in Germany since 2015.
""The beginning was really tough,"" he recalls. ""I felt lonely; I didn't speak German and very little English.""
While he has made German friends and met welcoming and understanding locals, Al Zaher, who is Muslim, has also faced a backlash.
One day, he received hate mail from a stranger saying: ""Go back to Syria. This is our country. You are ruining our country with your culture.""
But the young Syrian steadfastly believes that communication can break down barriers, so he launched the digital magazine ""Fluchtling"", German for refugee.
""I want them to see that we are human beings, just like them,"" he said. ""Being open-minded towards other people and cultures can be difficult, but we can achieve acceptance through respect and discussion.""
The German population is polarised over the newcomers, and support for Merkel's open-door refugee policy, called ""welcome culture"", has dropped.
The far-right AfD party's rise reflected disgruntlement and showed that even Europe's largest economy, where the unemployment rate is at a record low of 5.6 percent, is not immune to populism.
""I believe that most AfD voters aren't right-wing extremists, they are just afraid,"" Al Zaher said. ""They're afraid of Muslims, a different culture, a different way of thinking.""
From January to August this year, 123,878 asylum seekers arrived in Germany, according to the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees. Of those, almost a quarter came from Syria, followed by Iraqis and Afghans. In 2016, 280,000 asylum seekers arrived in Germany, while in 2015, at the height of the refugee crisis, 890,000 people crossed the border.
Most AfD voters aren't right-wing extremists; they are just afraid. They're afraid of Muslims, a different culture, a different way of thinking.
Hussam Al Zaher, Syrian refugee
Integrating those hundreds of thousands of new residents is a daunting task.
""It won't happen overnight,"" Afghan refugee Sahar Reza told Al Jazeera. ""It takes time - often years - to understand the German job market, the culture and to learn the language.""
The 29-year-old was born in Kabul, Afghanistan, and grew up in Pakistan.
She arrived in Germany in November 2014.
She completed an integration course, where she learned German, and has registered with the job centre to find employment.
""I hope I'll find a job to build an independent life here,"" she said.
Soon, Reza will start an internship at the Green Party in Hamburg, before she moves on to a placement at the local government.
She followed the election closely and was surprised by the outcome.
She said: ""I understand that some Germans are frustrated and feel alienated. They work and pay taxes ... Paying for others for such a long time can be irritating.""
Providing asylum seekers with food, housing, and German language courses is costly.
Last year, the federal government spent 21.7bn euros ($25.5bn) on dealing with the refugee crisis, according to the finance ministry. For this year, the government has earmarked 21.3bn euros.
Several projects have now joined the effort to help refugees settle in and feel at home.
""Multaka"" trains Syrian and Iraqi asylum seekers to become museum guides in Berlin; at ""Uber den Tellerrand"", refugees teach cooking classes; ""Sharehaus Refugio"" is a communal housing initiative; Refugees Welcome helps them find a spare room in flat shares and Start with a Friend connects volunteers with refugees to help them navigate aspects of life in Germany and build friendships.
The Berlin-based initiative Cucula also wants to empower refugees.
""We want to help them gain a skill set and ready them for the job market,"" said Corinna Sy, a cofounder.
At the Cucula workshop in the hip Kreuzberg district, refugees learn how to build furniture and trainees take part in educational programmes.
""In 2015, authorities and communities were completely overwhelmed by the influx,"" Sy said. ""Since then, we've made progress. But there are a lot of hurdles for refugees to find work and integrate. Many of them remain isolated and aren't part of our society yet. There's still a long way to go.""

Out of the 3,360 refugees who have fled into northern Zambia since August 30, at least 60 percent are children, according to the UN refugee agency (UNHCR).
After walking hundreds of kilometres alone for weeks, many are traumatised and show signs of malnutrition.

Despite the perilous journeys they endure, some say fleeing the country was their only option.
""My parents were both killed when the village was attacked,"" Leon Musongo, a Congolese child refugee, told Al Jazeera. ""The only thing I could do was run and leave the country.""
He added: ""I was told Zambia is safe. Bad people won't follow me here. I walked for a long time. I miss my parents, but at least I am alive and safe in Zambia.""
Most refugees are taken to the Kenani transit centre in the Nchelenge district, 90km from the border, where the Zambian government works with aid agencies to help them.
So far, 4,000 refugees have been registered at the refugee camp in northern Zambia.
Al Jazeera's Haru Mutasa, reporting from Kamponge, said the centre is ""filling up fast"" and the ""humanitarian needs are huge"".
""Some of the children who come alone wait in nearby villages, hoping their parents follow,"" she said. ""They can wait for days or weeks. Sometimes, they never hear from their families again.""
Aid workers say unaccompanied or separated children need to be placed in foster homes.
Meanwhile, dozens are making the journey alone. Others come with relatives because they got separated from their parents during the conflict.
According to UNHCR aid workers, the children have suffered a lot of trauma from the violence back home.
""You have children who have fled because they have lost their parents, and they saw their parents being killed,"" UNHCR's Anna Leer told Al Jazeera.
""You have children who came back to empty homes and then you have children who are telling us stories of forced recruitments and fear of abduction,"" she said.
The UN's children agency, UNICEF, said in July that the violence in Congo's volatile Kasai region has displaced at least 850,000 children.
The number of people displaced by conflict in Congo has nearly doubled in the past six months to 3.8 million, a UN official said in August.
The UN released a report in August, saying more than 250 people, including 62 children, were killed in Congo from mid-March to mid-June.
In the southeastern province of Tanganyika, clashes between rival groups have also forced thousands to flee, as has the long-running violence in the Kivu region, according to the Norwegian Refugee Council, an NGO.
In Kasai, violence erupted last September after the death of a tribal leader, known as the Kamwina Nsapu, who rebelled against the authority of President Joseph Kabila's government in Kinshasa and its local representatives.
The killing sparked violence that has escalated, including alleged violations of human rights such as extrajudicial killings, rapes, torture and the use of child soldiers.

Those arriving in Zambia described escaping ""extreme brutality, with civilians being killed, women raped, property looted, and houses set alight"", he said.
The majority of those fleeing come from the northern Katanga and Tanganyika regions. In recent years, these areas have been the scene of multiple deadly clashes between the Pygmies and Bantus from the ethnic Luba group.
A full 60 percent of those arriving in Zambia are children, including many showing signs of malnutrition, the UNHCR said.
""Malaria, respiratory problems, dysentery and skin infections are common among the refugees, who are in urgent need of protection and life-saving support,"" it added.
Many of the new refugees had already been displaced inside Congo by the violence before crossing the border.
""The lack of roads and the long distances ... make it difficult to monitor the situation and provide them with assistance,"" said Mahecic.
The approaching rainy season is expected to worsen the plight of those on the move, he warned.
The new arrivals, who bring the number of Congo refugees and asylum seekers in Zambia to around 27,300, are mostly being taken to the Kenani transit centre in the Nchelenge district, 90km from the border.
But Mahecic said some were opting to remain close to the border, waiting for their families to join them.
UNHCR was helping the Zambian government and the Zambian Red Cross distribute hot meals and basic items like tents, plastic sheeting, mosquito nets, and hygiene kits.
Aid workers were also providing psycho-social support to survivors of sexual violence.
Due to overcrowding, UNHCR said it had begun work on a second transit facility and was helping develop a more permanent settlement for the refugees.

FEATURE: 'I watched my son drown' - Rohingya boat survivor
The United Nations has called the exodus of 507,000 Rohingya since August 25 the world's fastest-developing refugee emergency and said Buddhist-majority Myanmar is engaging in ethnic cleansing against its mostly Muslim Rohingya minority.
Myanmar rejects that, saying its forces launched an offensive in the north of Rakhine state in response to coordinated attacks by Rohingya fighters.
Myanmar blames the rebels for attacks on civilians and for setting most of the fires that have reduced Rohingya villages to ashes. The fighters deny that.
Myanmar says more than 500 people have been killed in the latest violence, most of them rebels.
Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has called for an end to the violence and for safe zones to be set up in Myanmar to enable refugees to return.
She has also called for a UN fact-finding mission to go to Myanmar and for the government to implement recommendations on solving problems in Rakhine drawn up by a team led by former UN secretary-general Kofi Annan.
FEATURE: Rohingya refugees share stories of sexual violence
The crisis over Myanmar's treatment of the Rohingya is the biggest problem leader Aung San Suu Kyi has had to face since forming a government last year after winning a landmark election in late 2015.
Aung San Suu Kyi, in an address to the nation last month, said Myanmar was ready to start a verification process under a 1993 agreement with Bangladesh and ""refugees from this country will be accepted without any problem"".
There were already about 300,000 Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh before the most recent exodus.
Aung San Suu Kyi has no power over security policy under a military-drafted constitution and the public in Myanmar - where Buddhist nationalism has surged over recent years - largely supports the offensive.

Indigenous to a mountain region in the northern Middle East, the Kurds are the largest stateless nation in the world. The fourth largest ethnic group in the Middle East, around 25 million Kurds live in a territory that spans the borders of modern-day Turkey, Iraq, Syria, Iran and Armenia.
Kurds have a distinct community, united by race, culture and language - although several dialects exist. Due to the cross-border nature of their nation since the collapse of the Ottoman Empire, Arabic and Turkish are also widely spoken.
They have a long history of political marginalisation and persecution, and have repeatedly risen up, particularly in Iraq and Turkey, in pursuit of greater autonomy or complete independence.
The destabilisation of Iraq, the war in Syria, and the rise of the self-proclaimed Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL, also known as ISIS) have presented new challenges for the Kurds, as Kurdish forces have played an increasingly important role in the battle against ISIL.
At the end of World War I, the Treaty of Sevres was drafted to deal with the dissolution and partition of the Ottoman Empire.
The treaty bolstered Kurdish national aspirations by providing for a referendum to decide the issue of the Kurdish homeland.
The Treaty of Sevres was rejected by the new Turkish Republic, and a new treaty (the Treaty of Lausanne) was negotiated and signed in 1923.
The Treaty of Lausanne gave control of the entire Anatolian peninsula, or Asia Minor, to the new Turkish Republic, including the Kurdish homeland in Turkey.
There was no provision in the new treaty for a referendum for Kurdish independence or autonomy. Kurdish hopes for an autonomous region and independent state were dashed for the next few decades.
From the end of World War I to the Gulf War in 1990, the Kurds in Turkey, Iran, Iraq and Syria fought separate campaigns to achieve autonomy.
All of the campaigns were forcibly put down and the Kurdish people suffered greater suppression each time.
OPINION: Iraqi Kurdistan - Playing the independence game
After decades of military and political struggle, Kurds in Iraq secured constitutional recognition in 2005 of an autonomous Kurdish region in the north of the country.
Prior to 2005, the Kurds of Iraq launched successive rebellions aimed first at the British and later at the government in Baghdad.
Successive Iraqi administrations, particularly starting in the late 1970s, forcibly displaced hundreds of thousands of Kurds from northern Iraq, through a policy known as ""Arabisation"", and repopulated the areas with Arabs from central and southern Iraq.
The scale of the displacement of Kurds in the north during the mid-1970s was immense, displacing the entire Kurdish population from an area reaching from the town of Khanaqin, close to the Iranian border, to the Syrian and Turkish border areas around Sinjar.
In the 1980s, Saddam Hussein's government destroyed at least 4,000 villages and forcibly moved their residents to collective towns. In 1988, Hussein unleashed a campaign of vengeance on the Kurds that included a poison-gas attack on Halabja.
The Iraqi High Criminal Court later charged Hussein with genocide for attempting to annihilate the country's Kurds through military operations in 1988 that killed at least 50,000 civilians and destroyed thousands of homes.
The first glimpse of autonomy came in 1991, during the first Gulf War, when the US-led coalition fighting Hussein established a partial no-fly zone in northern Iraq. The stability allowed Kurdish forces to steadily gain control of the territory and paved the way for the 2005 constitutional agreement.
And while Iraq's autonomous Kurdish areas, also known as Iraqi Kurdistan, largely escaped the chaos and destruction that existed in the lead-up to and after Hussein's removal in 2003, major tensions remain.
The Kurdish Regional Government (KRG) has not yet defined its boundaries. Many Kurds are hoping to expand the current borders to include ""contested"" areas, many of which were Arabised under Hussein, including the Kurdish-majority city of Kirkuk - an oil-rich province the Kurds consider their ""Jerusalem"".
In the summer of 2014, as ISIL forces swept across large swaths of Iraq, Kurdish Peshmerga forces pre-emptively moved into the city to prevent it from falling into the group's hands.
Tensions also exist between the two main political parties, the Patriotic Union Party (PUK) and the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP), who fought a civil war from 1994 to 1997.
KRG President Massoud Barzani (KDP) announced in July 2014 that his government planned to hold a referendum on independence from Iraq. The declaration caused alarm in neighbouring countries, who were fearful that their own restive Kurdish populations would follow suit.
Results of the September 25 referendum showed that a majority of Iraqi Kurds supported secession.
After the 1990-1991 Gulf War and the no-fly zone enforced by the United States in Iraq's Kurdish region, Iraqi Kurds had autonomy.
In 1992, an alliance of political parties, the Iraqi Kurdistan Front, held parliamentary and presidential elections.
As a result, the Iraqi Kurdistan Front established the KRG, an autonomous government for Iraq's Kurdish region.
Today, at least 5.2 million people live in Iraq's Kurdish region, according to the KRG.
They have their own parliament, military (the Peshmerga), borders and foreign policy.
In 1994, a power-sharing arrangement between the PUK and the KDP collapsed.
In 2003, the US invaded Iraq and the Peshmerga joined in the fight to overthrow Hussein.
After Hussein was driven from office, the Iraqis, in a national referendum, approved a new constitution. The new constitution recognised the KRG and the Kurdish parliament.
In 2006, the PUK and KDP arranged to unify administrations under Prime Minister Nechirvan Barzani.

Kurds remain dependent on their neighbours for access to markets and to export oil, the Kurds' main economic resource.
Half of the Kurdish nation resides in Turkey, where they make up about 20 percent of the local population.
Modern Turkey's constitution denies the existence of distinct ethnic sub-groups, and since the country's founding, any expression by Kurds or other minorities of their unique ethnic identity has been repressed. The Kurdish language, spoken by millions in Turkey, was outlawed until 1991.
Ankara has consistently shut down Kurdish attempts to politically organise, and any action that hints at Kurdish nationalism is considered an offence punishable by imprisonment. The Turkish government has also been accused of systematically withholding resources from the country's Kurdish areas.
Abdullah Ocalan established the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) in 1978, calling for an independent state inside Turkey.
In 1984, the PKK launched an armed struggle against the Turkish state, which eventually left between 30,000 and 40,000 people dead and hundreds of thousands displaced, according to the International Crisis Group.
The PKK launched attacks against government property, government officials, Turks living in Kurdish areas and Kurds it accused of collaborating with the government.
In 2012, the Turkish government and the PKK began peace talks, and in 2013 a ceasefire was agreed on, although clashes continued.
In July 2015, the ceasefire collapsed a few days after a suicide bombing blamed on ISIL killed at least 33 young activists in the mainly Kurdish town of Suruc, near the Syrian border.
The United Nations said in a report this year that at least 2,000 people, including 1,200 local residents and 800 members of the security forces, have been killed in the latest wave of violence.
The PKK has attacked Turkish soldiers and police, while the Turkish government has launched what it called a ""synchronised war on terror"" against the PKK and ISIL.
Since then, air strikes on PKK camps in northern Iraq and clashes have killed hundreds of people.
In Syria, the Democratic Union Party (PYD) is one of the most prominent Kurdish opposition parties. It comprises a major part of the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), an alliance of Kurdish, Arab, Assyrians, Armenian, and Turkmen groups that was established in October 2015.
The PYD was founded in 2003 as an offshoot of the PKK, to which it remains closely tied. The PYD's armed wing is the People's Protection Units (YPG). The group has coordinated with both Syrian rebels and government forces in different parts of Syria to further its interests.
During the Syrian conflict, it managed to carve out a mini-state in three provinces in the country's north - Aleppo, Raqqa and Hassakah.
Backed by US coalition air strikes, the US-backed SDF have been fighting ISIL in an effort to recapture Raqqa, the armed group's self-declared capital.

The decision announced on Wednesday will disappoint refugee advocates and United Nations agencies, which are struggling to cope with millions displaced by several major wars.
In the 2016 fiscal year, the US accepted 84,995 refugees from around the world. This year it is on course to take in about 54,000.
""The security and safety of the American people is our chief concern,"" a senior US official told reporters on a call to announce the new figure.
""We need to ensure refugee resettlement opportunities go to those who are eligible for such protection and who are not known to present a risk to the safety or the security of our country.""
The administration proposed taking in a maximum of 19,000 refugees from Africa, 17,500 from the Middle East and South Asia, 5,000 from East Asia, 2,000 from Europe and Central Asia, and 1,500 from Latin America and the Caribbean.
FEATURE: In pursuit of asylum on the US-Canada border
The US is still the world's biggest destination for refugees, but arrivals are well down from a high of more than 200,000 in 1980.
The International Refugee Assistance Project, part of the New York-based Urban Justice Center, condemned the announcement as a case of the US abdicating its leadership role on humanitarian issues at a time when the world is grappling with the largest number of refugees since World War II.
""Resettlement is only an option in the most urgent refugee cases,"" said Betsy Fisher, IRAP's policy director.
""It's hard to comprehend why the administration would move to limit resettlement when the need is greater than ever. We are abandoning desperate people in life-or-death situations, including children with medical emergencies, US wartime allies, and survivors of torture.""
President Donald Trump has made no secret of his hostility to resettlement, having ordered a moratorium on new arrivals and tougher background checks.
Those who are accepted for resettlement in the US are selected by the UN refugee agency from among the most vulnerable displaced people.
FEATURE: Mosques vandalised as US states reject Syria refugees
Officials said they plan to complete a review of security procedures for vetting new arrivals by next month, but arrivals next year will be reduced.
Widows with children, the elderly, and the disabled are given priority and subjected to a thorough screening process by US security and intelligence agencies.
The process takes between 18 months and two years, and only then are the refugees assigned to resettlement agencies working under contract with the Department of State.
The agencies help families find housing and employment, mainly in small and medium cities around the US.
Trump has ordered a security review to further tighten procedures, slowing acceptances.

Within four months, the numbers had tripled. Since August 25, security forces and mobs have set more than 80 villages in northern Rakhine state ablaze in Myanmar’s scorched-earth campaign.
More than 500,000 Rohingya refugees - mostly women and children - fled to neighbouring Bangladesh in recent weeks, settling in makeshift settlements and encampments in and around the border town of Cox's Bazar.
The situation is a ""heartbreaking story to experience"", said Zahra Rasool, editorial lead for Contrast VR, Al Jazeera's virtual reality team.

On Thursday, Contrast VR released ""I am Rohingya"", the world's first 360° documentary about the Rohingya crisis.
""Hearing about it or seeing pictures of it was not enough. It just felt it was the right fit for the medium of virtual reality, to be able to take the viewers out into the refugee camp, to be able to take them to these people and give them a glimpse of what their challenges are,"" said Rasool.
Even months ago, the camps and informal settlements in Cox's Bazar were already overcrowded, with insufficient resources.
""I Am Rohingya"" follows the story of a young woman, Jamalida, as she tells the persecution she faced in Myanmar and shows us her daily life now in a refugee camp in Bangladesh.
The Rohingya are a majority-Muslim ethnic group who have been living in the Buddhist-majority nation of Myanmar in Southeast Asia for centuries.

The proposal on Wednesday by the European Union's executive branch involves admitting asylum seekers under the bloc's resettlement programme, which was introduced at the height of a major refugee crisis in 2015.
""We need to open real alternatives to taking perilous irregular journeys,"" European Union Migration Commissioner Dimitris Avramopoulos told a news conference in Brussels.
READ MORE: EU urged to resettle refugees directly from Middle East
The commission said that it had set aside 500 million euros ($590m) to support the resettlement effort. Member states will be free to participate in the scheme on a voluntary basis.
The EU's executive arm said that while resettlement from Turkey and the Middle East is to continue, an increased focus should be put on resettling vulnerable people from Libya, Egypt, Niger, Sudan, Chad and Ethiopia.
""Europe has to show that it is ready to share responsibility with third countries, notably in Africa. People who are in genuine need of protection should not risk their lives or depend on smugglers,"" Avramopoulos said.
Libya is the main jumping-off point for many people willing to brave potentially dangerous sea journeys across the Mediterranean in search of better lives in Europe. Egypt, Sudan, Chad and Niger - one of the main migrant transit countries in Africa - all border Libya.
Resettlement is managed by the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), which selects refugees who have a continued need for international protection.
INTERACTIVE: The Greek island helping Syrian refugees
European countries are individually responsible for deciding on resettlement numbers so they cannot be legally bound by Brussels to take more people in.
Last year, the main beneficiaries of UNHCR-facilitated resettlement programmes were refugees from Syria, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Iraq and Somalia.
The EU has already resettled 23,000 people from refugee camps in countries outside the EU under the scheme, mainly Turkey and Jordan, which were overwhelmed with people fleeing the war in Syria.
The resettlement programme is different from the EU's compulsory refugee quotas, which involved moving asylum seekers who had already reached Italy and Greece to other EU countries.
The latter scheme, which ended on Wednesday, saw just 29,000 people out of a planned 160,000 shared out around EU states to ease the pressure on the overstretched Greek and Italian authorities.
The commission also said it wants to ensure that those not permitted to stay in Europe are returned to their home countries more quickly.
""We have to be clear and brutally honest, people who have no right to stay in Europe must be returned,"" Avramopoulos said.
He also said that the commission would propose a temporary extension to allow countries such as Germany, Austria, Denmark and non-EU country Norway to keep systematic ID checks in place.
Separately, the EU also released plans on Wednesday to allow countries in the passport-free Schengen area to reintroduce border controls for security reasons for up to three years.
Countries in the 26-country Schengen travel area can currently reintroduce frontier checks for six months for security reasons, and two years if that is combined with a threat to borders.
""Under today's proposals, member states will also be able to exceptionally prolong controls if the same threat persists,"" the commission said in a statement.
Avramopoulos, however, said this should be a ""last resort"", and that keeping the Schengen area open for travel should be a priority.
Several countries, including France and Germany, have called for the extension after a series of attacks. France reinstated the checks after the November 2015 Paris attacks.
Border checks introduced by Germany, Denmark, Austria, Sweden and Norway in May 2016 to deal with a huge influx of refugees and migrants into Europe from Syria and North Africa are set to expire in November.
The reintroduction of so many checks raised concerns about the collapse of the Schengen zone, seen by many in Europe as a symbol of unity and freedom.

Twenty-four asylum seekers held on Manus Island off mainland Papua New Guinea (PNG) flew to Manila on their way to an undisclosed US location, the US embassy in PNG's Port Moresby told AFP news agency on Tuesday.
""They're the first group that have been approved, that have gone through the extreme vetting process and have met all the requirements for resettlement,"" Beverly Thacker, the embassy's public affairs officer, said.
About another 30 refugees held on Nauru in the Pacific will head to the US ""in the coming days"", she added.
Under Australia's strict and controversial refugee policy, anyone intercepted trying to reach the country by boat is sent to prison camps on Manus Island or the Pacific island of Nauru for processing.
The Australian government maintains that the refugees will never be eligible to be resettled in Australia.
The offshore prison camps have attracted widespread criticism from the United Nations and rights groups because of their harsh conditions and allegations of systemic abuse.
Last year, Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull agreed to a deal with then-US President Barack Obama to resettled up to 1,250 refugees from Nauru and Manus Island.
There was not, however, any obligation for the US to take a specific number of refugees.
READ MORE: Trump-Turnbull's dubious deal
Trump blasted the pact as a ""dumb deal"" after assuming the presidency, before begrudgingly agreeing to honour it.
Thacker did not provide the nationalities of the those being transferred and it is not clear how many of those still remaining will qualify for US resettlement.
""We expect that other refugees will be resettled in the coming months. They will all proceed with different time frames, depending on how fast they will get through the process,"" she said.
Nearly 800 men are held on Manus, and 371 men, women and children are detained on Nauru, according to Australian immigration data as of July 31.
Behrouz Boochani, a journalist and Iranian refugee who has been held on Manus Island since 2013, told Al Jazeera that while ""it's great to finally see"" that some refugees will be resettled, ""there are still 800 of us left here in this prison camp"".
He said that those who remain on Manus and Nauru want the Australian government to ""answer our simple questions"", which include ""How many people will go to America, when will they go and what is your plan for those left behind?"".
""I can't describe the happiness on the faces of those men who left, but also there was sadness,"" he said.
""They know the people who were in this prison with them are still here.""

Kon Karapanagiotidis, the chief executive of the Melbourne-based Asylum Seeker Resource Centre, said the news of the departures is ""so bittersweet"".
""Of course, people are happy for the men who have left,"" Karapanagiotidis told Al Jazeera. ""But this is not a solution.""
He said that there is still a long way to go for a resolution and that the biggest concerns are: ""What the future looks like for the men who remain on Manus"" and ""what will happen to those who are found to be refugees and those who are not?""
He added: ""How can they keep them in a country [PNG] where these men can't be protected.""

The international rights group said on Tuesday that Myanmar's security forces have committed ""serious violations"" that include rape and other sexual violence, murder, forced deportation and persecution of the Rohingya.
""The Burmese [Myanmar] military is brutally expelling the Rohingya from northern Rakhine State,"" James Ross, legal and policy director at Human Rights Watch, told Reuters news agency.
""The massacres of villagers and mass arson driving people from their homes are all crimes against humanity,"" he said.
In the past, HRW has also accused Buddhist monks in the area, as well as Myanmar security forces of ""crimes against humanity"".
""Attaching a legal label to the ghastly crimes ... may seem inconsequential,"" Ross said.
""But global recognition that crimes against humanity are taking place should stir the UN and concerned governments to action.""
Government spokesman Zaw Htay rejected HRW's accusations, saying no other Myanmar government was as committed to the promotion of rights as much as the current one.
""Accusations without any strong evidence are dangerous. It makes it difficult for the government to handle things,"" he told Reuters news agencies.
READ MORE: Who are the Rohingya?
Last week, HRW called for the UN Security Council to impose an arms embargo and sanctions on the Burmese military to end its ""ethnic cleansing campaign"" against the Rohingya.
Nearly 440,000 refugees have fled to Bangladesh since Myanmar’s army launched a military campaign in response to an attack by Rohingya fighters on dozens of police posts and an army base on August 25.
Myanmar's de facto leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, as well as Myanmar's military, have faced widespread international condemnation over its treatment of the Rohingya.
The UN has called the Rohingya exodus from Myanmar to Bangladesh ""the most urgent refugee emergency in the world"".
The mainly Muslim minority, who live primarily in Rakhine State, is not recognised as an ethnic group in Myanmar, despite having lived there for generations.
They have been denied citizenship and are stateless.
Many in Buddhist-majority Myanmar consider the Rohingya ""Bengali"", rejecting the term Rohingya as a recent invention.

Merkel's centre-right Christian Democratic Union party secured 33 percent of the vote on Sunday, down about nine percent compared to the last election in 2013.
Their main rival and current coalition partner, the centre-left Social Democrats led by Martin Schulz, got around 21 percent of the vote - their worst result in post-war Germany.
But the biggest change to Germany's political scene was the emergence of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party as the country's third biggest political force with 12.6 percent of the vote.
READ MORE: Who are Germany's far-right AfD?
The pro-business Free Democrats (FDP) bounced back into parliament with 10.1 percent of the vote, while the environmental Greens scored 9.2 percent and the leftist Die Linke picked up 8.9 percent.
Addressing supporters at party headquarters, Merkel, who will now have to find new coalition partners, said she hoped for ""better results"".
""Let's not beat around the bush, of course we would have preferred a better result, that's completely clear,"" Merkel said after the announcement of the exit polls.
""But let's also not forget that we have just come out of an extraordinarily challenging legislative period,"" Merkel added.
READ MORE: Anti-AfD protests erupt in Berlin
Al Jazeera's Dominic Kane, reporting from now said the big question now is who Merkel is going to govern with.
""And this a question Merkel did not address in her victory speech,"" Kane said.
READ MORE: What Germany's refugees think about the elections
Commenting on the AfD's performance, Kane said: ""this is not the first time since WWII that an overtly nationalist party has won seats in a form of the German parliament"".
He added, however, that ""certainly this is the first time that a far-right party has won so many votes, and therefore so many seats proportionately in the parliament.""
The far-right, anti-immigrant party was founded just four years ago as an anti-euro force. Its manifesto included a pledge to ban all mosques and criminalise people wearing the veil.
Under Merkel's leadership, Germany opened its doors to about a million asylum seekers at the height of Europe’s refugee crisis in 2015, prompting fierce criticism from the AfD leadership, who say her stance has had an unacceptably high fiscal, social and administrative cost.
Nina Schick, political analyst at consultancy firm Hanbury Strategy said, it is ""very important to keep things in perspective"" when analysing the AfD's election performance, citing a ""huge change"" in German society in the wake of the refugee crisis.
""The fact they are on 13 percent, yes it's a kickback, a reaction to what's happened to the German society but the other side of the coin is that a million refugees and asylum seekers came to the country and are being integrated into society and millions of Germans are helping them to learn the German language and try to get jobs,"" she said.
""So it’s not as bad as some might think given the huge change that Germany faced with the refugee crisis.""
Forming a coalition government is expected to be an arduous process for Merkel that could take months as all potential partners are unsure whether they really want to share power with her.
Schulz ruled out a re-run of Merkel's existing alliance with the SDP after the centre-left party's disappointing results.
""It's perfectly clear that the electorate has directed us to go into opposition,"" Schulz said.
An alternative coalition for Merkel would be a three-way tie-up with the FDP and the Greens. That is a combination as yet untested at the national level.
Both the FDP and the Greens have played down the prospect of a coalition, but as they have been out of government for four and 12 years respectively, they may be lured into an alliance by the prospect of power.
""It will now be much more challenging for her to build a coalition in the first place because she will have to deal with two different parties, with different cultures,"" Olaf Boehnke, senior adviser at Rasmussen Global, told Al Jazeera.
""There is very leftish wing in the Greens party, and there is a very conservative, even close to nationalism, wing in the FDP,"" he added.
Pointing to the big drop in support for Merkel's Christian Democrats, Boehnke argued that the chancellor was both the ""winner and the loser"" of the election.
""And this also makes here as a coalition partner quite unattractive to her new potential coalition partners because she always manages to ruin them, in a way, as we are now seeing with the SPD,"" he said.
Merkel campaigned on her record as chancellor for 12 years, emphasising the country's record-low unemployment, strong economic growth, balanced budget and growing international importance.
The election victory sets the 63-year-old on course to match Helmut Kohl’s record as the longest-serving leader in German’s post war history.
Polls opened at 8am (06:00 GMT) and closed at 6pm (16:00 GMT) with turnout slightly lower than four years ago.

Since August 25, Bangladesh has been facing the unenviable dual task of looking after 430,000 wretched people while trying to persuade Myanmar to take them back. At least 240,000 of them are children.
The influx adds to about 300,000 Rohingya, already located in camps around the Bangladeshi city of Cox's Bazar.
Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has earned praise for opening up the frontier to the desperate stream of humanity, but diplomats and experts say she cannot expect much international help in either campaign.
READ MORE: Myanmar - Who are the Rohingya?
They also warn that Bangladesh's warm welcome so far could easily cool if solutions are not found.
""Bangladesh can't deal with this crisis alone,"" Champa Patel, head of Asia Programme at the Chatham House international affairs institute in London, told AFP news agency.
""It is densely populated, poor and already home to a historically displaced Rohingya community. While currently welcoming, this could change if the situation becomes protracted without any clear end in sight.""
There is not enough food, water or medicine to go around. Roads around the camps are littered with human excrement, exacerbating UN fears that serious disease could quickly break out.
""A shortage of basic sanitation means the ever-present risk of disease, and aid efforts are only starting to meet their needs,"" said Al Jazeera's Jonah Hull, reporting from Cox's Bazar, near Bangladesh's border with Myanmar.
The country has reacted with compassion to the horrific tales of rape and murder which refugees have brought with them. Scores of trucks carrying aid donated by the public arrive each day in Cox's Bazar. But it is not enough.
The UN's refugee agency chief has warned that the crisis may be long.
""We need to be ready for a problem that could last for some time,"" Filippo Grandi, head of UNHCR, told Al Jazeera. ""But we also need, as the prime minister of Bangladesh has said many times, to invest in a solution.""
""We cannot ignore that these people have a right to return.""
At the UN General Assembly last week, Hasina sought global help to solve the problems of the Rohingya, left stateless by Myanmar's refusal to give them citizenship.
She called for the establishment of safe zones for the Rohingya. Myanmar has not responded.
Hasina wants pressure on Myanmar to force it to take back a group that has been in Rakhine for generations.
But neither Bangladesh nor the western countries who have been shocked by events in Myanmar have any real clout with its de facto leader Aung San Suu Kyi or the generals who hold the effective power.
""The Myanmar army holds the key to resolve the crisis, in the immediate and short term,"" Ali Riaz, a professor of Illinois State University in the United States and an expert on Bangladesh-Myanmar relations, told AFP.
""An extremist Buddhist nationalist political force has thrived in past decades in Myanmar,"" Riaz said.
Bangladesh has ""few effective instruments of statecraft at its disposal"" to make Myanmar take back the refugees, according to Zachary Abuza, a professor at the National War College in Washington and a specialist on Southeast Asian security.
No regional group has shown a desire to get involved either. There have been demonstrations in Indonesia and Malaysia for the Rohingya. Both are members with Myanmar of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).

""Bangladesh could try to work with Malaysia and Indonesia to pressure Myanmar through ASEAN. But that is not going to work. The Rohingya issue is very divisive within ASEAN,"" said Abuza.
China and India are the keys to influencing Myanmar, but neither seems likely to step in.
Both have supported the Myanmar government out of economic interest, said Patel at Chatham House.
They ""have investments in the country that they would not want to be undermined because of the current crisis.""
The Myanmar generals are not listening to anyone anyway, according to Abuza.
""The Burmese military leadership has factored in the diplomatic costs of its actions. I think it is important to understand that they have been itching to do this for a long time,"" he said.
Rohingya's Muslims have long been ostracised in Myanmar, where they are considered ""illegal immigrants"" and face severe restrictions.

The AfD, which will be entering parliament for the first time, was founded just four years ago as an anti-euro force. Its manifesto included a pledge to ban all mosques and criminalise people wearing the veil.
The election result produced shockwaves, both internationally and domestically. Luxembourg Foreign Minister Jean Asselborn said Nazis are back in the German parliament.
""Seventy years after the end of the war, neo-Nazis are again sitting in the Bundestag,"" Asselborn told DPA news agency, referring to Germany's lower house of parliament.
Major Jewish groups also expressed alarm and dismay about the nationalists' strong showing on Sunday.
Josef Schuster, president of the German Central Council of Jews, said the party ""tolerates far-right thoughts and agitates against minorities"".
He said he expects Germany's other parties will ""reveal the true face of the AfD and unmask their empty, populist promises.""
Under Merkel's leadership, Germany opened its doors to about a million asylum seekers at the height of Europe's refugee crisis in 2015, prompting fierce criticism from the AfD leadership, who say her stance has had an unacceptably high fiscal, social and administrative costs.

Forty people who had been on the fishing boat were saved.
One pregnant woman who was rescued was taken to hospital but lost her baby, state-run Anadolu news agency said.
Search and rescue efforts are under way to find people still missing off the Kefken district, a Coast Guard statement said.
The area lies about 130km east of Istanbul, Turkey's biggest city.
Mehmet Unal, a local official in the nearby town of Kandira, said the boat was believed to be carrying 70 migrants, most of whom were Iraqis.
Unconfirmed media reports said the refugees and migrants had boarded the boat in Zonguldak, which lies further to the east, and were trying to cross into Romania.
The boat reportedly sank due to bad weather and rough waters.
Western Turkey and the Black Sea had been hit by a heavy storm and rains overnight.
Turkey has emerged as a hub for migrants from troubled countries around the world including Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan who are seeking a route west to the European Union.
In 2015, around a million people undertook risky sea journeys to cross the Mediterranean to Europe, mostly to Greece from Turkey over the Aegean Sea.
Thousands died in the perilous crossing. Responding to international pressure, Turkey tightened its sea borders and cracked down on migrant smuggling rings as part of a 2016 deal with the European Union.
The numbers of refugees and migrants crossing the Aegean has now dwindled. But increasing numbers, now rising to hundreds within a month, are now trying to cross the Black Sea from Turkey to EU member Romania.
Some 834 refugees and migrants were caught and 10 smugglers detained in seven Black Sea incidents between mid-August and early September, according to statistics published by the Turkish Anadolu news agency.

In a separate incident on Thursday, Libyan authorities said more than 90 refugees and migrants were missing after a boat went under off the country's coast. At least eight people were confirmed dead.
Libya is the main departure point for refugees and migrants using the dangerous Central Mediterranean route.
Refugees and migrants are dying in the Mediterranean at a quicker rate than last year, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) has reported.
At least 2,550 refugees and migrants died from January 1 to September 13, 2017, compared with 3,262 from the same period in 2016, the IOM said - a drop of 22 percent.

""That's the number of people coming into Europe anyway,"" Maria Stavropoulou, who has overseen Greece's Asylum Service since it was founded in 2013, said on Thursday.
""This past year [the EU] has had a million asylum applications. We know who makes these applications. The majority is people coming irregularly into Europe. So what are we doing? We're just giving business to smugglers.""
The EU runs a resettlement programme, through which refugees can be admitted directly from Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan.
The scheme has a ceiling of 22,504 over two years.
Most refugees brave the dangerous crossing to Europe in rubber dinghies from the Turkish coast to the islands of the East Aegean Sea, or from Libya to Italy.
As a result, more than 2,500 have died in the Mediterranean so far this year, and twice that number last year.
Stavropoulou spoke to Al Jazeera in the run-up to the conclusion of the EU's two-year relocation programme on Friday.
Initiated at the same time as resettlement, relocation was designed to alleviate pressure on the asylum services of Greece and Italy, which, as first arrival countries, were both disproportionately burdened.
Relocation was the EU's first serious attempt at a common asylum and migration policy, but it put European solidarity to the test.
Poland, Hungary and Denmark refused to participate, while Austria, Slovakia and the Czech Republic took in 15, 16 and 12 people respectively.
INTERACTIVE: The Greek island helping Syrian refugees
Partly as a result of its patchy implementation, the scheme has relocated about 28,000 people, less than a fifth of its target of 160,000.
Another problem with relocation was the fact that only nationalities with acceptance rates of more than 75 percent were eligible. That left out Afghans and Iraqis, whose only option has been to apply for asylum in Greece.
Still, Stavropoulou called relocation ""a very positive experiment"", because it was ""the only real tangible sign of solidarity from other member states"".
But as the programme drew to a close, Greece continued to receive undocumented migrants - more than 3,700 by the end of August, and a surge of 2,400 in September, according to coastguard figures.
These people will now be added to Greece's backlog of asylum applications - 37,000 so far this year alone - or be forced to smuggle themselves deeper into the EU.
Daniel Esdras, head of the International Organisation for Migration in Greece, which implements the relocation programme, believes it is time to stop using people smugglers as a natural barrier to refugee migration.
""You really need labour force in Europe in the next 20-30 years,"" he said. ""So the answer here would be regulated, legal migration; right now migration is in the hands of the smugglers and the charities.""
For all its faults, relocation has set a foundation for a unified EU policy on asylum and refugees, according to Stavropoulou.
""We have to have a vision, and right now, we, Europe as a whole, we're too short-sighted,"" she said.
""We react to what we see as the risk knocking on our door ... We need to look long-term, and this is where a very valuable resettlement programme kicks in. The other alternative is that we simply say, 'Europe is not receiving refugees'.""

https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/09/funding-cuts-impact-syrian-refugee-women-170920205051623.html,refugee,2286,Wed Sep 20 2017 22:52:08 GMT+0000,Noor Ibrahim,US funding cuts and the impact on Syrian refugee women,"Zaatari, Jordan - For many women living in the Zaatari refugee camp, the large sign by the entrance of the only maternity clinic is a familiar sight.
It reads, Women's and Girl's Comprehensive Center, and features two digital display boards: one reflecting the current date, and the other indicating the number of babies safely delivered in the clinic, now approaching the 8,000 mark, all without a single maternal death.
Also printed on the sign is a flag - with stars and stripes, red, white, and blue - a tribute to the country that first made this clinic a reality for thousands of women and girls in the world's largest Syrian refugee camp.
The United States provided the vast majority of the clinic's funding when it opened its doors in Zaatari five years ago and continued to support it through contributions to the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA). That was up until this past April when the Trump administration announced a total and immediate withdrawal of US funding to UNFPA.
Months later and the US flags are still dotted throughout Zaatari's maternity clinic: on doors, walls, staff uniforms - even medical equipment. The clinic in Zaatari represents everything the UNFPA has worked towards since its inception in 1969: providing healthcare services to vulnerable women and girls around the world - be it maternal care, gender-based violence response, advocacy against child marriage, or safe access to contraceptives.
Formerly the second-largest donor to the UN agency, the US provided 80 percent of the start-up costs for the clinic in 2012 and continued to help sustain it until the Trump administration's decision to completely withdraw support on April 3.
That decision was based on the claim that the UNFPA ""participates in the management of a program of coercive abortion or involuntary sterilisation in China"". In the same letter, addressed to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, the State Department also acknowledged there is no evidence that directly links UNFPA to any coercive abortions or involuntary sterilisations in China.
UNFPA denies these allegations and asserts its work ""promotes the human rights of individuals and couples to make their own decisions, free of coercion or discrimination.""
The UN agency explained how US contributions have ""saved tens of thousands of mothers from preventable deaths and disabilities,"" in a statement released in April.
With the support of the US, UNFPA prevented the deaths of 2,340 women during pregnancy and childbirth in more than 150 countries in 2016 alone, it said. The Zaatari clinic, in particular, treats more than 100 women every day and delivers an average of 80 babies per week.
""What is most disturbing to me is the fact that a country that represents democracy, a country that represents civil rights, a country that others take note from is suddenly taking a stance that gives others a free license to bash the women's agenda,"" said Laila Baker, UNFPA's representative in Jordan, at her office in Amman.
After the US funding cut, UNFPA was left with a gaping budgetary hole and only enough funding to sustain Zaatari's maternity clinic for the remainder of 2017.
Although the clinic doesn't open until 9am, the line outside its doors begins to form at 6am. By the time the name of the first patient echoes through the clinic's loudspeaker, the queue of pregnant women waiting to get routine tests, scans and screenings has already exceeded the entrance to the general waiting area.
In the delivery room on the opposite side of the clinic, three or four women at a time can be found lying on adjacent beds, tucked behind the veil of a thin pink curtain that cuts through the middle of the room. As midwives and nurses scurry passed the curtains, they offer soft words of encouragement, all muffled in between labour screams from women and girls across the room, some as young as 14.
""God, please don't leave me now. Please don't leave me here,"" yelled one young woman, clenching the sheets beneath her on a recent summer afternoon in the delivery room. She affectionately referred to one of the midwives, Amoon, by her nickname, ""Amooneh"", and pleaded with her to stay at her bedside in the moments before she delivered her baby.
""We had a simple, small beginning. It was essentially one caravan, one midwife, and one doctor,"" said Rima Diab, the leading gynaecologist at the clinic.
When Diab was first offered the job five years ago, she decided she needed to see what it was like in Zaatari before making a final decision.
There was much to consider. She had been working at the same place, the Jordanian Ministry of Health, for eight steady years; she lived in the Jordanian city of Irbid, which is an hour and a half away from Zaatari by car, and she had no experience working in a refugee camp. But after spending just two days there, she decided to take the offer.
""It felt [it was] absolutely necessary,"" said Diab.
When she first started working in the refugee camp, her husband was not initially supportive of her decision. ""I have to be available 24/7, even if it's 2 or 3am,"" she explained, her phone going off every few minutes, with consistent knocks on her office door from the other doctors, nurses, and paediatricians she oversees.
""Mentally, I'm always here,"" she continued, ""so it kind of took me away from my life at home. Since I took this job, whenever I have friends or family over, they make me surrender my phone for the duration of their visit,"" she said with a laugh.

Despite seeing dozens of patients every single day, Diab maintains a close relationship with many of them. She described an incident in which one of her patients, a 16-year-old girl who was eight months pregnant at the time, was redirected to another hospital after suffering violent convulsions. Diab, who suspected the patient was suffering from a case of pre-eclampsia, a pregnancy complication that can sometimes be fatal, asked the medic to stay on the phone to monitor her patient's status.
""I knew they were missing something and I couldn't get it out of my head,"" said Diab. It wasn't until the patient's husband came running to the clinic, pleading with her to come see his wife that she decided to pack her medication, get into a car and drive to the other hospital. When Diab arrived, she confirmed the patient was indeed suffering from pre-eclampsia and treated her accordingly at the hospital. A month later, both the patient and her newborn baby made a full recovery.
""I feel personally responsible for following up on every case, and the same goes for every doctor in this clinic,"" said Diab.
Growing up, Usool al-Atmeh never imagined she would spend her honeymoon in a refugee camp in Jordan. al-Atmeh, who was 16 when she got married in her hometown of Daraa in Syria, was celebrating with her family and friends when she mistook deliberate gunfire for celebratory shots, which are common at Syrian weddings. As the sounds became louder, guests started to leave, and the wedding came to a halt. Al-Atmeh recalls sitting in her white dress at home with her new husband, staring blankly at the dead air of a television broadcast, wondering why it had stopped airing. Weeks later, as the Syrian civil war intensified, al-Atmeh and her husband headed for the border towards the Zaatari refugee camp.
When al-Atmeh became pregnant with her first baby, Ahmed, at 17-years old - she quickly realised how grateful she was for all the services provided by Zaatari's maternity clinic. But it wasn't until her second pregnancy, when she experienced her first miscarriage, that she realised she wasn't just grateful for the midwives, nurses, and doctors - she depended on them.
""I was four-months pregnant, and I came in for a check-up. Then they told me my baby had no pulse. Then I just walked back home.""
Al-Atmeh was standing in her kitchen when she first started to bleed. At first, she didn't know what it was, but then she saw little hands and little feet the size of her palm. She already had a name picked out for him, Abdullah, and she wept quietly before she wrapped him in a white cloth, muttered a prayer, and buried him. After that, she made her way back to the clinic, where the concerned staff took the time to console her.
""They told me not to worry, that these things happen, that I'll be able to have another baby,"" said al-Atmeh as she rocked her 10-day-old baby girl, Fatima, back and forth in her arms. Fatima is her third healthy baby, and al-Atmeh was passing by the clinic to pick up birth control pills - another service offered by the clinic free of charge. ""It's hard not to have a mother or a sister here in the camp with me, but that is exactly what these people are to me.""
Besides the maternal health care services offered at the clinic, the sister programmes they provide include therapy for victims of domestic violence, legal counselling, awareness sessions where counsellors work with parents to advocate against early marriage, and recreational programmes where women can knit, paint, and even practice yoga together.
In the five years she has spent in Zaatari, Fatima Abu al-Shareef, 36, lost many family members who stayed behind in Syria - the most painful being the death of her mother. She became a patient at the clinic after two failed pregnancies, both of which resulted in a miscarriage seven months down the line.
""I had to deal with a lot of emotional trauma,"" said al-Shareef, her voice trembling. ""To think about where we used to be back in Syria and how we are now. The lifestyle. The finances. It was a hard thing to fathom.""
After a year of counselling and support, al-Shareef found solace in ""just being able to connect"" with other women about what they had gone through and how their lives had changed. The time she spent chatting as she knitted a new sweater, or just breathing between yoga positions, brought back a sense of normalcy to her life. ""I found a new family here,"" said al-Shareef.
Another woman, 33-year-old Jude al-Hassan, came to the clinic after years of domestic abuse at the hands of her husband. Back in Syria, she moved away from her husband, but the war forced her to move back in with him as a refugee in Zaatari.
""When I first got here [Zaatari] I would speak to no one. I locked myself at home and totally isolated myself,"" she said.
A year ago, al-Hassan woke up to the sound of a knock on her door. It was an outreach agent from the clinic, who stood there, smiling, happy to explain the services offered at the clinic. Al-Hassan decided to give it a shot and has been involved with the clinic ever since.
Back in her UN Amman office, Baker explained that typically, after a significant withdrawal of funding, the first thing to go is the number of outreach agents working on the ground. This could mean a failure to reach victims of domestic abuse who are too afraid to come forward, women who may be pregnant but have not followed up with doctors, or mothers who don't bring their babies to the clinic for postnatal check-ups, which is essential for newborns in a refugee camp.
Currently, the clinic has a system in place where women who miss appointments receive home follow-ups. But following the US defunding, the future of this service, and many more like it through UNFPA, is unclear.
""Without active outreach, neonatal death almost always occurs more often,"" explained Dr Diab. ""Women sometimes try to treat newborn illnesses with home remedies, like garlic or sugar, and they don't understand that they need to bring them here to the clinic. That's why these follow-ups are so important.""
In the wake of the US funding cut, Sweden increased its contribution to UNFPA by $11m. Canada has also pledged up to $20m to fund global family planning initiatives to fill the US gap. Just days after the cut was announced, a group of private American citizens that call themselves the ""Friends of the UNFPA"" raised $100,000 and sent in a cheque specifically devoted to the maternity clinic in Zaatari.
While enough was made to cover the clinic for the remainder of the year, Baker said there is still a lot of uncertainty over the future of the clinic and other UNFPA programmes in Jordan.
""It's just too big of a financial gap,"" she said. ""So the UNFPA is going to have to do one of two things: We can either draw down the number of services, or we draw down on the type or the scale. It's going to be a difficult year on the humanitarian front.""

Back in the clinic, Dr Diab had a few more minutes to spare before going to see her next patient. The medical staff don't have time to worry about funding issues, despite the fact they will deal with the consequences first-hand.
Diab breathed in deeply and with a tired smile sat back in her chair and stared at a poster on the wall with the American flag printed on it.
""This place is the cradle of the whole camp. It carries two souls - the mother and the baby,"" she said speaking slowly.
""To want a healthy birth, a healthy baby, and a healthy mother. That is all that really matters, isn't it?""

Unity is home to oil fields that have been abandoned due to fighting.
The clash between Riek Machar's loyalists and government forces occurred early on Monday in Nhialdiu, a village close to the town of Bentiu which has changed hands repeatedly since a civil war began nearly four years ago. ""The number of the bodies that were found on the ground were 25,"" said Lam Tungwar, information minister for Northern Liech state, adding that the attack was ""repulsed"".
READ MORE: South Sudan - A country captured by armed factions
Those killed during the fighting included women, elderly people and local police officers, Lam Tungwar, state minister of information for Northern Liech, told Reuters news agency.
Lam Paul Gabriel, a spokesman for the SPLA-IO fighters, confirmed the clash, claiming ""a successful operation"" in which ""the gallant SPLA-IO forces took control of Nhialdiu"", killed 19 government soldiers and seized dozens of weapons.
Tungwar said most of the dead were civilians.
Dickson Gatluak Jock, military spokesman for South Sudanese Vice President Taban Deng Gai, said the attack coincided with dialogue in Nhialdiu between rival clans aimed at securing peace in the region.
After gaining independence from Sudan in 2011, South Sudan descended into war in December 2013, pitting President Salva Kiir's troops against fighters loyal to Machar.
A peace accord was signed in August 2015 and Machar returned to the capital in April last year to share power with Kiir.
However, the deal fell apart less than three months later, and Machar and his supporters fled the capital, Juba.
Tens of thousands of people have been killed and more than 3.5 million have been displaced since the conflict began.
The war has created what has been called one of the world's fastest-growing refugee crises, and both sides of the conflict have been accused of abuses.

At least 39 people - including a 10-year-old girl - were killed and 94 others wounded in the incident in South Kivu.
Of those wounded, 37 were treated in nearby Kamanyola, while 57 were critically injured and airlifted to Goma for medical care.
Details of the incident are still unclear, with various accounts and official government statements contradicting the UN's comments on the matter.
Here is what we know so far:
On the night of September 12, the national army (FARDC) patrol arrested four Burundian refugees armed with ""weapons"" in the Congo town of Kamanyola in South Kivu province.
Al Jazeera has since seen a video showing the four refugees carrying sticks.
They were held for two days by the army and were then taken to the general migration directorate.
On Friday, September 15, at around 16:00 GMT, Burundian refugees and asylum seekers living in the area left their camps and went to the office of the National Intelligence Agency to protest the detainment of the four men.
The protesters, a group of a few hundred, were concerned the detainees would be repatriated and handed over to the Burundian government.
These people came to Congo for protection. Not to be killed
Florence Marchal, spokesperson for MONUSCO
According to a witness who spoke to Al Jazeera, who will remain anonymous for security reasons, two local police officers tried to stop the refugees from approaching the office of the National Intelligence Agency.
According to reports, collaborated by a statement from an interior ministry official, troops tried to disperse the crowd by firing warning shots in the air. The refugees responded by throwing stones as it became clear that they would be physically stopped from airing their concerns.
According to the witness, one refugee grabbed a gun from a Congolese soldier and shot him dead.
It was then that the soldiers opened fire on the crowd, shooting wildly and indiscriminately.
The UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) told Al Jazeera on Tuesday that death toll had risen to 39, including 15 women and a 10-year-old girl.
Around 114 others were injured, of whom 57 were airlifted by UN helicopters to the towns of Bukavu and Goma. The UN confirmed that one soldier was killed.
According to the Congolese government, five soldiers were killed.
There are currently more than 2,000 refugees in the Kamanyola area, close to the Burundi border.
Following the incident, around half of the refugees moved into the vicinity around the MONUSCO base, for safety.
The Congolese government claims that the army was attacked by armed persons and not refugees.
Lambert Mende, the country's minister of media and communication, told Al Jazeera there had been an exchange of fire and described the encounter ""as an attack on the army"".
""The [Congolese army] suffered an attack by armed persons. They are not refugees. Who identified them as refugees? An inquiry is opened to identify them,"" he said.
The government has opened an inquiry into the incident, he said.
The Congolese army is expected to release a statement once the investigation is complete.
The UN says that those protesting outside the Congolese office were refugees and asylum seekers who had applied for international protection.
Babar Baloch, a UNHCR spokesman based in Geneva, said that the agency has multiple accounts indicating the protest was peaceful but ""took an ugly turn and the security forces fired live fire indiscriminately into the crowd"".
MONUSCO, the UN mission in Congo, condemned the incident and called for an immediate investigation into the matter.
Florence Marchal, MONUSCO spokesperson, described the response of Congolese forces as ""disproportionate"".
""These people came to Congo for protection. Not to be killed,"" she said.
Maman Sidikou, head of MONUSCO, also said in a statement that he was ""shocked with the large number of civilian deaths"" and called on authorities to ""swiftly open legal actions to establish truth and do justice to victims"".
Most Burundian refugees arrived in Congo after the unrest of 2015, when President Pierre Nkurunziza decided to change the constitution and run for a third term in office.
Around 300,000 people fled to neighbouring countries as violence and intimidation spread to all parts of the country.
There are currently 44,000 Burundian refugees in Congo.
Nkurunziza won presidential elections later in 2015, but the country remains on edge with the UN documenting a series of assassinations and targeted killings over the past two years.
The Burundian government has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing, but people continue to leave Burundi out of fear.
Congo is home to hundreds of thousands of refugees and displaced persons who fled violence and intimidation. Activists and human rights organisations say that Congo is ill-suited to host refugees.
""State control and capacity in these territories are limited, with local security forces often a source of insecurity for the population. Social services are barely functional to nonexistent, and standards of living are extremely low,"" Refugees International said in a report in May 2016.
""Further, more than 50,000 Congolese in these two territories are internally displaced, with more than 360,000 IDPs in South Kivu province as a whole.""
Dismas Nkunda, chief executive officer of Atrocities Watch Africa, told Al Jazeera that for many, coming to Congo is a last resort.
""It's like jumping from the frying pan and into the fire,"" Nkunda said, from the Ugandan capital, Kampala.
The UNHCR said that 7,200 Burundian refugees have returned so far but that it did not see large scale returns in 2017 given there had been an increase in refugee numbers in early 2017.
""Violence, human rights violations and fear of persecution are the main reasons for their departure to the DRC,"" the UNHCR said in a report released in May 2017.
""The total refugee population is expected to grow to over half a million by end 2017 - making it potentially the third biggest refugee situation in Africa,"" the UN Agency said.Burundi has repeatedly urged refugees to return home and officials in Tanzania, home to more than 250,000 refugees, have also asked Burundians to return home.
Following a meeting with Nkurunziza in July, Tanzania's President John Mugufuli, asked Burundian refugees to return, saying that he has been assured that ""the place was now calm"". He was immediately criticised for the suggestion that Burundi was now stable.

Uganda, currently hosting more than 45,000 Burundian refugees also asked refugees to return home. Nkunda told Al Jazeera that there is concerted campaign to get refugees back home. ""It is an attempt to show that the country is stable when it isn't,"" he said.
In September 2017, UN investigators said that Burundian troops were killing, committing torture and sexual violence, and other serious crimes against Burundi citizens.
""We also noted a lack of will on the part of the Burundian authorities to fight against impunity and guarantee the independence of the judiciary. As a result, there is a strong likelihood that the perpetrators of these crimes will remain unpunished.""
Baloch from the UNHCR said that repatriation has to be voluntary. He also said he was not aware of an attempt by Congo to repatriate Burundian refugees.
Though Congo has opened an investigation, it is unclear that justice will be served for victims of this massacre.
Anneke Van Woudenberg, executive director of Rights and Accountability in Development (Raid), told Al Jazeera that letting such actions pass without justice would do nothing to help avert abuses by security forces in the future.
""Justice is rare in Congo, that's true, but there has been an uptick on bringing cases of abuses by security forces to trial, usually military trial.
""This is a clear example of where that should happen. A huge number of refugees/migrants have been killed, which demonstrates at best an over-reaction by the security forces and at worst woeful deliberate killings,"" van Woudenberg said.

""We must not sleepwalk our way into war,"" said Guterres on Tuesday at the annual summit of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) in New York.
""When tensions rise, so does the chance of miscalculation. Fiery talk can lead to fatal misunderstandings,"" he said in his first state-of-the-world report since taking the top job at the UN on January 1.
""The solution must be political. This is a time for statesmanship.""
His message on ""fiery"" rhetoric was implicitly directed at North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, but also at the United States and President Donald Trump, who later warned of ""totally destroying North Korea"" if it does not back down.
""The United States has great strength and patience, but if it is forced to defend itself or its allies, we will have no choice but to totally destroy North Korea,"" Trump told the UNGA, shortly after Guterres' speech.
""'Rocket Man' is on a suicide mission for himself and for his regime. The United States is ready, willing and able, but hopefully this will not be necessary,"" Trump added, referring to the North Korean leader with a nickname he gave last week on Twitter.
The UN Security Council has unanimously imposed nine rounds of sanctions against North Korea since 2006 and Guterres appealed for the 15-member body to maintain its unity on Pyongyang.
Guterres, a former head of the UN refugee agency, also urged the Myanmar government to end the ""vicious cycle of persecution, discrimination, radicalisation and violent repression"" that has seen more than 400,000 Rohingya Muslims flee into neighbouring Bangladesh.
He called for the UN and humanitarian agencies to be allowed access to Rakhine to offer aid.
Guterres also addressed the issue of global migration.
The number of refugees on the move in the world can be managed with a global sharing of responsibility, he said.
""I myself am a migrant, as are many of you. But no one expected me to risk my life on a leaky boat or cross a desert in the back of a truck to find employment outside my country of birth,"" Guterres said.
""Safe migration cannot be limited to the global elite.""
He also spoke about the climate change, calling on the world to ""get off the path of suicidal emissions"".
""We know enough today to act. The science is unassailable,"" he said, reiterating his message to global leaders to implement the Paris Agreement ""with ever greater ambition"".

In a sprawling and squalid camp on the Bangladesh-Myanmar border, Rohingya refugees on Tuesday rejected Aung San Suu Kyi's claim that many members of their minority group were safe in Myanmar and said her vow to repatriate displaced Rohingya carried no weight.
""Suu Kyi is a traitor. We can't rely on her words,"" said Sultan Ahmed, who arrived in Cox's Bazar in Bangladesh along with hundreds of thousands of refugees two weeks ago.
The 80-year-old told Al Jazeera that he did not believe the de facto leader would act on her words because ""everything is run and decided by the army"".
Aung San Suu Kyi ""is only a name there. Nobody cares about her,"" he said.
READ MORE: Aung San Suu Kyi condemns 'all human rights violations'
The Nobel Peace Prize laureate has faced fierce international criticism for saying little about the abuses faced by the Rohingya.
She broke her silence on Tuesday, condemning ""all human rights violations"" in Rakhine State, and vowing to take action against those who commit abuses.
However, she failed to comment on the military offensive that sent more than 420,000 Rohingya pouring across the border into Bangladesh, an operation the UN has branded as ""ethnic cleansing"".
Abdul Hafiz, a Rohingya man in Kutupalong, was angered by Aung San Suu Kyi's implication that Rohingya were themselves responsible for their plight.
Aung San Suu Kyi had said more than half of Rohingya villages were not affected by the violence, and invited diplomats and observers to visit those villages so they could learn why Buddhists and Muslims ""are not at each other's throats in these particular areas"".
""Let them see the plight of the people there,"" Hafiz told the Associated Press news agency.
""They have kept people in confinement. Let the world media know from them whether we are tortured or living in joy.""
Shah Ahmed, a 60-year-old refugee who fled Maungdaw in northern Rakhine State two weeks ago, said he also no longer trusted Aung San Suu Kyi.
But he told Al Jazeera he was ready to return to his village if her government would ""ensure peace, our safety and return of our property"".
Human rights groups were sceptical too, criticising Aung San Suu Kyi for failing to condemn the army's alleged abuses, as well as her claim that army operations had ceased on September 5.
""While it was positive to hear Aung San Suu Kyi condemn human rights violations in Rakhine state, she is still silent about the role of the security forces,"" Amnesty said in a statement.
""Aung San Suu Kyi today demonstrated that she and her government are still burying their heads in the sand over the horrors unfolding in Rakhine State,"" the rights group said.
""At times, her speech amounted to little more than a mix of untruths and victim blaming.""
Message to the world from Arba Khatun, a Rohingya
Phil Robertson of Human Rights Watch, referring to Aung San Suu Kyi's assertion that military operations had ended, asked: ""If that is true, then who is burning all the villages we've seen in the past two weeks?""
He said satellite images showed about half of all Rohingya villages had been torched and it was time that Aung San Suu Kyi, the government and the military faced the fact that the security forces ""don't follow a code of conduct and shoot and kill who they want"".
Ronan Lee, a Rohingya researcher at Deakin University, said Aung San Suu Kyi's speech was ""deeply concerning from a humanitarian point of view"".
It was likely to provide the military with ""genuine solace and certainty that she will not call on them to stop what they are doing,"" he told Al Jazeera from Melbourne.
Meanwhile, foreign diplomats who were present in Naypyidaw as she gave her speech gave an overall positive reaction to her address.
The ambassador of China, Hong Liang, welcomed Aung San Suu Kyi's speech saying it would improve understanding. Nikolay Listopadov, Russia's ambassador to Myanmar, said there was no evidence of ethnic cleaning.
Mohammad Sufiur Rahman, Bangladesh's ambassador to Myanmar, said: ""I simply say one thing, that whatever she said is encouraging and we have to implement that in the right spirit.""
US Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Patrick Murphy also attended the address but did not comment.

They mainly blame the government troops of President Salva Kiir, but also opposition forces loyal to former Vice President Riek Machar for the abuses.
Many women who survived described how their husbands were killed before they were gang-raped by government soldiers.
""My husband was following a short distance behind us,"" one rape survivor told Al Jazeera.
""When he came and found these men on me, he told them to stop,"" she said as she described how five government soldiers gang-raped her, along with four other women.
""They grabbed him immediately and killed him with a knife.""
Al Jazeera heard similar stories from other women now living refugee camps in Uganda.
""They tied a blindfold on my face,"" another rape survivor said. ""They took all of my possession and stripped me,"" she added.
""Three of them were all on me. After, I grabbed my baby and left naked. Now, I have nothing.""
Ken Scott, a war crimes prosecutor who has worked on tribunals for many conflicts, told Al Jazeera that the sexual violence in South Sudan is the worst he has ever seen.
""It's such a high level of incidents, widespread, been going on for a substantial period of time, not isolated incidents, [and] one can only conclude that war crimes involving sexual violence are taking place,"" Scott said.
A spokesman for government forces told Al Jazeera that soldiers who rape are punished. He also questioned the stories coming from the refugee camps.
""How do we substantiate those claims, to know for sure they are not made up without someone coming forward to report it?"" Lul Ruai Koan, a government army (SPLA) spokesman, told Al Jazeera.
""These are claims that are being made in the refugee camps,"" he said.
""How do we get convinced they are not being told to say weird things about the SPLA?""
OPINION: The world has abandoned South Sudanese refugees
But rights groups say they have documented widespread sexual violence in South Sudan.
A report by Amnesty International in July found that ""thousands of South Sudanese has been subjected to sexual violence including rape, gang rape, sexual slavery, sexual mutilation, torture, castration, or forced nudity.""
The report found that the perpetrators were from all sides of the conflict.
""This is pre-meditated sexual violence on a massive scale,"" Munthoni Wanyeki, Amnesty's regional director for East Africa, the Horn and the Great Lakes, said in a statement during the report's release.
""Women have been gang-raped, sexually assaulted with sticks and mutilated with knives,"" Wanyeki said.
Amnesty called on the government to ""take deliberate measures to halt this epidemic of sexual violence"".
After gaining independence from Sudan in 2011, South Sudan descended into war in December 2013, pitting President Salva Kiir's troops against those or rebel leader and former Vice President Riek Machar.
A peace accord was signed in August 2015 and Machar returned to the capital in April last year to share power with Kiir, before the deal fell apart less than three months later and Machar and his supporters fled the capital.
Tens of thousands of people have been killed and more than 3.5 million have been displaced since the conflict began.
The war has created what has been called one of the world's fastest-growing refugee crises and both sides of the conflict have been accused of abuses.

""Two children and one woman were killed in a stampede during an unauthorised clothing distribution on the road in Balukhali Pan Bazar area. Despite local regulations and the control room established, private distributions of relief items continue,"" said a September 15 report by the Inter Sector Coordination Group (ISCG).
Meanwhile, though several well-meaning Bangladeshi citizens have offered their support to the Rohingya, the ISCG said at least six people from the local community who identified themselves as camp managers at another location had been charging refugees for land and shelter.
The perpetrators were arrested and jailed for 15 days, the report said.

ISCG, which comprises various humanitarian agencies, said 326,700 people in makeshift and spontaneous settlements in Bangladesh were in need of emergency shelter.

Al Jazeera reporters in Cox's Bazar, the main city for arrivals, have witnessed long queues and struggles for aid.
Torrential rain there has made their plight even more challenging.
Several Rohingya refugees have told Al Jazeera that after arriving in Bangladesh, they have not received food, shelter or enough clean water.
At the end of August, Myanmar's military launched a bloody crackdown on ethnic Rohingya - a mostly Muslim group often described as the world's most persecuted minority - after an armed Rohingya group carried out attacks against the army.
Since the attacks by the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA), the army has killed more than 400 people and driven out hundreds of thousands from the western Rakhine state, creating one of the biggest refugee crises of recent times.

Women, many with babies on their shoulders, stood in torrential rain in the hope of getting food, tarpaulins and clothes distributed by local Bangladeshis.
Chaos was all around at Balukhali, where a large number of Rohingya have taken refuge, as the rain added to the misery of the persecuted community.
Highlighting the grave conditions for Rohingya refugees, aid agencies reported on September 15 that at least two children and one woman were killed in a stampede that broke out as aid was being distributed.
More than half of the estimated 412,000 Rohingya who have escaped Myanmar's military crackdown live in makeshift sites without proper shelter, clean drinking water and sanitation.
On Sunday, police and army officials were checking vehicles coming from the camps towards Cox's Bazar city, a day after the Bangladesh government announced restrictions on the refugees' movement.
Arefa, along with hundreds of fellow Rohingya, was among the crowd waiting for the much-needed aid.
She was drenched, holding her two-year-old daughter Minara on her shoulder. Arefa was crying. She said there was no food for her and her two children.
""I do not have food, no shelter and no way to cook anything. I have yet to get any relief,"" she said with tears pouring down. ""If I get aid I eat, otherwise I go hungry.""

Arefa, who arrived here two days ago from Lambaguna village in Akyab district, said she is 40, but she looked much younger. Her husband, Nabi Hussain, was shot dead by the Myanmar military, she said.
A fellow Rohingya offered her a small tarpaulin tent until she arranges her own. But at the private aid distribution centre in Balukhali, she had little luck.
Myanmar's military launched a bloody crackdown on ethnic Rohingya, who are mostly Muslims, after an armed Rohingya group carried out a deadly attack against the army.
Since then the army has killed more than 400 people and driven out hundreds of thousands from the western Rakhine state, creating one of the biggest refugee crises of recent times.
Distressed Rohingya have built shanties made of tarpaulin and bamboo sticks on sandy hillocks and in open spaces, as there is limited space in the registered camps run by national and international NGOs.
The Inter Sector Coordination Group, which comprises various humanitarian agencies, on Sunday said in a report that 326,700 people in makeshift and spontaneous settlements were in need of emergency shelter.
The rain caused flooding in several camp sites, forcing people to move to new areas. Balukhali already hosts thousands of Rohingya who fled last October.
Manzoor Ahmed, who had pitched a tent on a private land provided by a local Bangladeshi, said his house was inundated.
""It's really bad; water has entered our home. The entire area is flooded,"" he said.
""I have no space to sleep. My brain is not working. I do not know what to do.""

The 65-year-old arrived in Balukhali three days ago with 11 members of his family. He said he was lucky; none of his family members got killed.
People were seen carrying bamboo sticks on their shoulders to erect homes as the muddy, narrow roads slowed down aid work.
Aid agencies are warning that operations cannot run in this disorganised manner. Coordination between humanitarian agencies, local NGOs and the authorities is crucial, they have said.
""We are trying to expand our activities and build new clinics and health posts to give basic access to healthcare, but at the end of the day everything is slowed down by the infrastructure and logistic challenges,"" said Robert Onus, emergency coordinator at Doctors Without Borders (MSF).
""The scale of the crisis may not be well understood by everyone because it's impossible to describe unless you see it with your own eyes,"" he told Al Jazeera.
Fearing an outbreak of disease, authorities have set up vaccination booths in various camps for children under five.
Misada Saif, spokesman for the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), told Al Jazeera: ""It's a huge crisis and beyond the capacity of many international organisations working on the ground. People are still on the move; families are looking for shelter.""
Message to the world from Nasima Khatun, a Rohingya
At the distribution centre at Balukhali, 20-year-old Fahmida Begam waited for support with her one-year-old son, Yasir Arafat. She arrived one week ago from Myuinisong in Maungdaw with her husband, Shamsur Alam, and their two children.
She stays in a shanty that she says is too small to accommodate the six members of her family. Due to the rain, they could not sleep last night as the tarpaulin leaked, making the sandy floor too cold.
""Yesterday I came to receive relief but returned empty-handed. I came to try my luck again but it's around 12pm, and I have not got anything.""

The Alternative for Germany (AfD) party is projected to win up to 12 percent of the vote during Germany's federal election on September 24 and become the third-largest party in the Bundestag, polls show.
Alexander Gauland, cofounder of the AfD, told Reuters news agency the party would push for the creation of a new committee to examine Merkel's track record on refugees and migrants entering the country.
""We want Merkel's policy of bringing one million people into this country to be investigated, and we want her to be severely punished for that,"" he said.
""We're gradually becoming foreigners in our own country.""
It was unclear what Gauland meant by ""punishment"".
Founded in April 2013, the AfD narrowly missed out on the five percent share of the vote required to win representation in parliament during the federal election in September of the same year.
The party, which advocates the closure of Germany's borders and the introduction of a minimum quota for deportations, could now become the biggest opposition force in the national assembly if the current coalition of Merkel's Christian Democratic Union party and the Social Democratic Party (SPD) is returned, as polling indicates is likely.

That scenario would result in the AfD chairing the influential budget committee and allow its parliamentarians to open the general debate during budget consultations.
Georg Pazderski, a member of the AfD's executive board, told reporters his party would use its predicted role in the new parliament to highlight the cost of the refugee crisis and trouble in the eurozone.
""We'll have a voice when we're in parliament. We won't be an easy opposition,"" he said.
A number of candidates have already expressed their unwillingness to work with any new AfD parliamentarians, citing the group's controversial policy programme that includes the banning of the full Islamic face veil.

Sahra Wagenknecht, a candidate for the Left Party, has pledged to vote against any AfD members who represent ""Nazi views"" being elected to positions of responsibility in the new parliament.
Wagenknecht, an MP since 2009, has declared elements of the AfD's far-right programme - such as the proposed ban on minarets - unconstitutional.
Right-wing parties have featured prominently in elections across Europe this year.
Marine Le Pen, leader of France's National Front party, won 34 percent of the vote in May's presidential election, and Geert Wilders, of the Dutch Party for Freedom, scored 13 percent in March, during the Netherlands' general election.

Maman Sidikou, the head of MONUSCO, the UN's peacekeeping mission in the country, said in a statement on Saturday that at least 36 refugees had been reported killed and more than 100 injured.
He called for a swift investigation and urged Congo's security forces to use force as a last resort only.
Josue Boji, a Democratic Republic of Congo interior ministry official, said troops had tried to disperse the refugees by ""firing in the air, but were overwhelmed"" when the group responded by throwing stones during Friday's confrontation.
Police and soldiers opened fire as the refugees protested over the resettlement plan and tried to free some of their arrested compatriots in the town of Kamanyola in eastern Congo, sources told the Reuters news agency.

Activist Wendo Joel said the refugees had seized a weapon and killed a soldier, though that account was not confirmed by other sources.
A Burundian refugee told AFP news agency: ""I saw people falling down, men, women and children who were completely unarmed.""
Al Jazeera was unable to independently verify the death toll.
A local army spokesman, Dieudonne Kasereka, told Reuters there had been clashes between soldiers and refugees armed with knives and machetes, but that he did not know if there were any deaths.
The UN refugee agency (UNHCR) also called for an investigation of ""this tragic incident,"" saying in a statement that it was ""in shock and saddened"".
UNHCR spokesman Andreas Kirchhof told Al Jazeera that the ""circumstances are not clear"". He added that teams have been sent to the area, including medical staff to treat those injured.
Burundian Foreign Minister, Alain-Aime Nyamitwe, on Twitter described the incident as a ""shooting"" and said ""explanations are needed"".
Jason Stearns, of the Congo Research Group, told Al Jazeera that while it is still very difficult to know what happened, the context is important.
OPINION: Only mediation can stop the violence in Burundi
""The Congo has not only harboured many refugees, but many people that the Burundian government has deemed to be its opponents,"" Stearns said.
""The Burundian government, along with the Congolese government have, at least in the past, targeted those opposition members.""
More than 400,000 refugees have fled Congo's neighbour Burundi since violence erupted there in April 2015 when President Pierre Nkurunziza said he would seek a third term in office, a move his opponents said was unconstitutional.
Earlier this month, the UN released a report accusing Burundi's government of crimes against humanity, including executions and torture, and urged the International Criminal Court (ICC) to open a case ""as soon as possible"".
Burundi's government firmly rejected the allegations, accusing the UN investigators of being ""mercenaries"" in a Western plot to ""enslave African states"".

The 15-member Security Council met behind closed doors on Wednesday, at the request of Sweden and Britain, to discuss the crisis for the second time since it began and agreed to publicly condemn the situation.
Speaking before the meeting, Antonio Guterres called the situation for the Rohingya refugees ""catastrophic"" and ""completely unacceptable"", acknowledging that the minority group was being ethnically cleansed in the Buddhist-majority nation.
READ MORE: Who are the Rohingya?
Around 370,000 of Myanmar's minority Rohingya population have fled the country's western state of Rakhine into neighbouring Bangladesh in recent weeks, according to the UN.
The violence began on August 25, after Rohingya fighters attacked police posts, prompting a military crackdown.
""I call on the Myanmar authorities to suspend military action, end the violence, uphold the rule of law and recognise the right of return of all those who have had to leave the country,"" the UN chief said at the press conference in New York.
Guterres' comments mirrored those of UN human rights chief Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein, who denounced the situation in Myanmar as ""a textbook example of ethnic cleansing"" on Monday.
Al Jazeera's Rosiland Jordan, reporting from the UN headquarters, said it remains to be seen if the Security Council can do anything from a practical standpoint following Wednesday's meeting.
""There is a lot of concern here at the UN about the ongoing crisis,"" she said. ""The question is: who can be held accountable and can the situation be resolved quickly, or is there going to be another looming humanitarian catastrophe?""
The council ""expressed concern about reports of excessive violence during the security operations and called for immediate steps to end the violence in Rakhine, de-escalate the situation, re-establish law and order, ensure the protection of civilians ... and resolve the refugee problem.""
British UN Ambassador Matthew Rycroft said it was the first statement from the Security Council on Myanmar in nine years.
This comes as Myanmar's national leader Aung San Suu Kyi cancelled her trip to next week's UN General Assembly to deal with the crisis, her office said on Wednesday.
She is due to give her first speech on the situation in a televised address next week.
Aung San Suu Kyi has been widely condemned for lack of moral leadership and compassion in the face of the crisis, denting the Nobel Peace Prize laureate's reputation.
The secretary-general also said he has spoken to Aung San Suu Kyi several times.
Pressure has been mounting on Myanmar to end the recent surge in violence, with the United States calling for protection of civilians and Bangladesh urging safe zones to enable refugees to go home.
Asked if the situation could be described as ethnic cleansing, Guterres replied: ""Well I would answer your question with another question: When one-third of the Rohingya population had to flee the country, could you find a better word to describe it?""
Myanmar's government said on Wednesday that 176 Rohingya villages were completely empty as residents fled the recent upsurge in violence.
""This is a dramatic tragedy,"" Guterres said. ""People are dying and suffering at horrible numbers, and we need to stop it. That is my main concern.""
The government says about 400 people have been killed in the latest fighting in the western state.
Guterres called on the authorities to allow the UN and NGOs into Rakhine State to provide humanitarian aid.
The UN describes the Rohingya as the world's most persecuted people.
The Rohingya have suffered years of discrimination and have been denied citizenship in Myanmar since 1982.
But Guterres said that the Myanmar government should either grant the Rohingya nationality or legal status that would allow them to live a normal life.

The Supreme Court justices granted on Tuesday a request from the Trump administration to block a lower court decision that would have eased the restrictive refugee policy and, according to the justice department, allowed up to 24,000 additional refugees to enter the United States before October.
The Supreme Court ruling gives Trump a partial victory as it prepares for a key hearing on the constitutionality of Trump's controversial executive order in October.
Trump signed a revised executive order on March 6 that banned travellers from six Muslim-majority countries - Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen - for 90 days and locked out most refugees for 120 days in a move that the Republican president argued was needed to prevent ""terrorist"" attacks.
The March order followed an even stricter version in January, which was quickly challenged in court and suspended in February.
The administration has yet to say whether it will seek to renew the bans, make them permanent, or expand the travel ban to other countries.
Since being introduced in March, US courts have limited the scope of the revised executive order.
Lower courts have ruled that the bans violate the US Constitution and federal immigration law.
The high court has agreed to review those rulings.
Its intervention so far has been to evaluate what parts of the policy can take effect in the meantime.
The justices said in June that the administration could not enforce the bans against people who have a ""bona fide"" relationship with people or entities in the US. The justices declined to define the required relationships more precisely.
In a ruling last week, the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals said grandparents, aunts, uncles and cousins of legal US residents would be exempt from the travel ban.
The justice department opted not to appeal that part of the 9th Circuit decision.

However, the 9th Circuit also ruled that Trump's refugee policy was too broad, and the court allowed entry to refugees from around the world if they had a formal offer from a resettlement agency.
The justice department appealed, and the full Supreme Court sided, at least for now, with the administration in a one-sentence order.
A representative for the Hawaii attorney general, who challenged the administration in court, could not immediately be reached for comment.
Earlier on Tuesday, Hawaii said in a court filing that the US government could still ""bar tens of thousands of refugees from entering the country"".

All the 9th Circuit ruling did is ""protect vulnerable refugees and the American entities that have been eagerly preparing to welcome them to our shores"", the state's lawyers said.
Amnesty International, the UK-based rights organisation, called Tuesday's Supreme Court decision a ""devastating blow"".
""The Supreme Court today has dealt yet another devastating blow to vulnerable people who were on the cusp of obtaining safety for themselves and their families,"" Amnesty's Naureen Shah said in a statement.
""They [refugees] continue to be subjected to unimaginable violence and fear while their lives are in limbo.
""This ban is inherently cruel and no part of it should be allowed to stand.""

Around 370,000 of Myanmar's minority Rohingya population have fled the country's western state of Rakhine into neighbouring Bangladesh in recent weeks, according to the UN.
The violence began on August 25, after Rohingya fighters attacked police posts, prompting a military crackdown.
""In our parliament, we have taken a resolution that Myanmar should take all their citizens back to their country and create a congenial atmosphere so that they can go back,"" said Hasina.
The crisis has drawn sharp criticism from around the world.
On Tuesday, Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei called the killing of Muslims a political disaster for Myanmar.
UN human rights chief Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein denounced the situation in Myanmar as ""a textbook example of ethnic cleansing"" on Monday.
Britain and Sweden have requested that the UN Security Council hold an urgent meeting on Wednesday to address the Rohingya situation.
Aid workers in Bangladesh say they are trying to increase the relief effort, but thousands of refugees are pouring in every day.
""The needs are massive,"" said Corinne Ambler, spokesperson for the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC). ""We are scaling up as fast as we can, but we need international assistance to help these people.""
Al Jazeera's Divya Gopalan, reporting from Katupalong near the border town of Ukhiya in Cox's Bazar district, said: ""The refugees are in distress, and after fleeing their country, they now have to face tough conditions in the makeshift camps.""

""If we go back they will kill us,"" Rahima Begum, a 24-year-old Rohingya refugee, told Al Jazeera. ""How can I forget, I've seen babies being thrown into the fire by the military.""

""I call on the government to end its current cruel military operation, with accountability for all violations that have occurred, and to reverse the pattern of severe and widespread discrimination against the Rohingya population,"" Zeid said.
""The situation seems a textbook example of ethnic cleansing.""
The UN chief's warning comes a day after Bangladesh's foreign minister said ""a genocide"" is being waged in the country's violence-hit Rakhine state.
""The international community is saying it is a genocide. We also say it is a genocide,"" AH Mahmood Ali told reporters after briefing diplomats in Dhaka on Sunday.
Ali described actions following the attacks on security forces on August 25 as ""revenge"" by Myanmar troops.
""Should all people be killed? Should all villages be burnt? It is not acceptable,"" he said, adding Dhaka was seeking a peaceful solution, not a ""war"" against Myanmar.
""We did not create the problem. Since the problem started in Myanmar, that's why they should resolve. We have said we'll help them,"" he said, adding that the problem took a ""new turn"" after the August 25 attacks.

""I call on the government to end its current cruel military operation, with accountability for all violations that have occurred, and to reverse the pattern of severe and widespread discrimination against the Rohingya population,"" he said.
Bangladesh has stepped up efforts to resolve the crisis, with Sheikh Hasina, the country's prime minister, calling on Myanmar to ""take steps to take their nationals back"" on Tuesday.
""Myanmar has created the problem, and they will have to solve it … We want peaceful relations with our neighbours,"" she said during a visit to a refugee camp in southwestern Ukhiya province, near the border with Myanmar.
The Bangladeshi parliament approved a motion on Monday urging the international community to increase pressure on Myanmar to resolve the crisis.

Ali met Western and Arab diplomats and the heads of UN agencies based in Bangladesh to seek support for a political solution and humanitarian aid for the Rohingya.
He told the diplomats that some 300,000 Rohingya had fled to Bangladesh in the past two weeks, taking the total number of such refugees in the country to more than 700,000.
""It is now a national problem,"" Ali said.
At least two diplomats who attended the briefings said the minister told them as many as 3,000 people may have been killed in the latest round of violence, which is a much higher estimate than the 1,000 previously reported by the United Nations.
The UN said 294,000 Rohingya refugees have arrived in Bangladesh since attacks by Rohingya fighters on Myanmar security forces in Rakhine on August 25 sparked a major military backlash.
Tens of thousands more are believed to be on the move inside Rakhine.
Ali's comments come as the chair of Bangladesh's National Commission for Human Rights said leading figures in Myanmar could face trial for ""genocide"" at an international tribunal.

Myanmar's de facto leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, as well as Myanmar's military, have faced international condemnation over its treatment of the Rohingya.
The mainly Muslim minority, who live primarily in Rakhine State, is not recognised as an ethnic group in Myanmar, despite having lived there for generations.
They have been denied citizenship and are stateless.
Many in the Buddhist-majority country consider the Rohingya ""Bengali"", rejecting the term Rohingya as a recent invention.
Bangladesh's Ali accused Myanmar of running a ""malicious propaganda"" campaign to term the Rohingya as ""illegal migrants from Bangladesh"" and the fighters as ""Bengali terrorists"".

Al Jazeera's Divya Gopalan, reporting from Cox's Bazar, said that Ali's comments are significant because it ""means they are making a much harder effort to get more international help"".
She said, however, that many in Cox's Bazar would say the government's aid so far has been ""inadequate"".
""You can ask anyone here, and they will say that they haven't received government help,"" she said.
""What we are mostly seeing are local charities filling the void and locals helping out.""
Bangladesh has also been criticised for turning back hundreds of Rohingya refugees at its border with Myanmar.
Earlier this year, it had resurrected a proposal to relocate tens of thousands of Rohingya refugees to a remote island that is prone to flooding. The plan has been decried by human rights groups.
A commission led by former UN chief Kofi Annan last month said Myanmar must scrap restrictions on movement and citizenship for its Rohingya minority if it wants to bring peace to Rakhine State. Ali called on the international community to urge the Myanmar government to immediately implement the recommendations of the commission's report ""in its entirety"".

An Afghan government statement said on Sunday that Nancy Hatch Dupree, who first came to Afghanistan in 1962 and spent much of her life collecting and documenting historical artefacts, died in Kabul overnight at the age of 90.
She amassed a vast collection of books, maps, photographs and even rare recordings of folk music, all now housed at Kabul University, and wrote five guidebooks.
Many Afghans viewed Dupree as one of their own, and hundreds of people posted condolences on social media.
Nancy Dupree's extraordinary (and selfless) dedication to Afghanistan will not be forgotten. She passed away in her beloved kabul. RIP
Born in 1927 in India to American parents, Dupree first came to Afghanistan as the wife of diplomat Louis Dupree, a renowned archaeologist and scholar of Afghan culture and history.
After the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979, Dupree was forced to leave the country, but instead, she moved to a refugee camp in Peshawar in Pakistan to help Afghan refugees.
During her time in Peshawar, Dupree preserved government and non-government documents relating to Afghanistan's history and culture during the Soviet invasion when many priceless books were sold to be used for fuel.
When the Taliban was overthrown in 2001, Dupree chose to stay in Peshawar as she was concerned about the safety of the document collection.
Dupree moved back to Kabul in 2003 and worked with the Afghan government to establish a home for the collection of documents that at the time numbered over 7,000 items.
Very saddened by the death of #NancyDupree. Afghans value and respect her services of decades for #Afghanistan. Nancy will be missed! RIP pic.twitter.com/QdCuujQKDa
The collection was eventually moved to Kabul University where today it is now known as the Afghan Collection.
She also established the Louis and Nancy Hatch Dupree Foundation, which promotes the history and culture of Afghanistan. The foundation also ensures the safety of the document collection.

Most of the Rohingya are arriving by foot or boat across Bangladesh's 278km border with Myanmar, a fourth of which is made up by the Naf river.
The Rohingya have long been subjected to discrimination in Buddhist-majority Myanmar, which denies them citizenship.
Myanmar's government regards them as illegal migrants from Bangladesh, even if they have lived in the country for generations.

OPINION: Aung San Suu Kyi does not deserve the Nobel Peace Prize
The Rohingya have long been subjected to discrimination in Buddhist-majority Myanmar, which denies them citizenship and regards them as illegal immigrants from Bangladesh, even if they have lived in the country for generations.
Myanmar's army has previously said it had killed 387 Rohingya fighters. Authorities say they have lost 15 security personnel since the August attacks.
Myanmar's Nobel Peace Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi, who spent years under house arrest when Myanmar was a military dictatorship, is now the country's de facto leader with the title of State Counsellor.
Rights groups, activists - including many who campaigned for her in the past - and her fellow Nobel laureates Malala Yousafzai and Archbishop Desmond Tutu have condemned her.
When it awarded Aung San Suu Kyi the 1991 Peace Prize, the Nobel committee said that she ""emphasises the need for conciliation between the sharply divided regions and ethnic groups in her country"".
But earlier this week, in her first statement since the violence erupted, Aung San Suu Kyi, 72, condemned a ""huge iceberg of misinformation"" on the crisis, without mentioning the Rohingya flocking to Bangladesh.
Meanwhile, Rohingya Muslims are warning that unless the international community takes a firm stance against the violence, the country could witness ""ethnic cleansing on the scale of the Srebrenica massacre"".
On Tuesday, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres also warned of the risk of ethnic cleansing, appealing to Aung San Suu Kyi and the country's security forces to end the violence.
Two Rohingya sources told Al Jazeera on Thursday that several people had been shot dead near the Maungdow township in Rakhine, with thick plumes of smoke seen billowing from the village of Godu Thara after security forces burned down the homes of fleeing Rohingya.
Access to the area has been blocked to foreign media so Al Jazeera cannot independently verify the sources' accounts.
Speaking to Al Jazeera from Maungdow township under a pseudonym, Anwar, 25, said there was a ""sustained and targeted military campaign against Muslims"".
""The Myanmar army and Buddhist extremists are specifically targeting the Muslim population,"" he said.
""Women, children, the elderly - no one has been spared. The situation is continuing to get worse, and Aung San Suu Kyi's government is failing to raise its voice,"" Anwar added.

Orban's remarks on Friday came two days after the European Court of Justice (ECJ) threw out the case from Hungary and Slovakia against the EU's quota scheme to spread up to 160,000 Syrian, Iraqi and Eritrean asylum seekers among the 28 member states.
""Hungary is a European Union member, so the bloc's treaties must be respected and the court's rulings must be acknowledged,"" the populist leader said in a radio interview.
""But this is not a reason to change an immigration policy that rejects migrants,"" he added.
""The court's ruling does not require Hungary to do anything"", Orban said, because it focused only on whether the EU had the legal right to enforce refugee quotas.
He said EU countries which let in migrants, unlike Hungary, decided to do so of their own will and now they cannot ask Budapest to take a part in correcting their mistake.
""It is not us Hungarians who question the rules of the club, but the Commission had changed the rules and this is unacceptable,"" Orban said.
The ""real battle [against Brussels] is just beginning,"" he added.
""The whole issue raises a very serious question of principles: whether we are an alliance of European free nations with the Commission representing our joint interests, or a European empire which has its centre in Brussels and which can issue orders.""

On Wednesday, the Luxembourg-based ECJ rejected a complaint filed by Hungary and Slovakia, reaffirming the bloc's right to order individual countries to accept refugees as part of a scheme drawn up in a bid to resettle arriving refugees more equally across the EU.
Under the scheme, Hungary is required to take in 1,294 refugees and Slovakia 902.
The court's decision is final and not open to appeal. As a result, European officials will continue to be able to order member state governments to take in specific quotas of refugees entering the bloc. Countries refusing to abide by the programme risk facing fines.
Describing immigration as ""poison"", Orban has been at the forefront of a rebellion in eastern and central Europe against the quotas.
At the height of the migrant crisis, Budapest erected fences on its southern borders and recruited 3,000 ""border hunter"" police to patrol the frontiers.
The tough measures, which were denounced by Brussels and human rights groups, slowed the influx of refugees to a trickle until the so-called ""Balkan Route"" was effectively closed in March 2016.
In July 2016, Human Rights Watch released a report criticising Hungary's treatment of refugees and migrants detained after entering or while attempting to enter its territory, accusing the country's authorities of ""breaking all the rules for asylum seekers"".

Last month, Orban asked the EU to refund half the 800 million euros ($950m) Hungary says it has spent on the borders.
But European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker chided Hungary this week for demanding extra money while refusing to participate in the relocation scheme.
Orban on Thursday sharply criticised Juncker's response, saying that forcing Hungary to accept immigrants amounted to ""violence"".
In July, the EU Commission threatened the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland with lawsuits for not implementing the relocation measures.
Hungary and Poland remain the only EU states that ""have not relocated a single person"", while the Czech Republic has not relocated anyone since August 2016, the Commission said.

""Women, children, the elderly - no one has been spared,"" survivors have said, pleading for the international community, regional powers and their civilian government to stop the bloodshed.
Myanmar's army has previously said it had killed 387 Rohingya ""fighters"", blaming the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA) for the latest round of violence that began last month. Yet, fleeing Rohingya refugees have accused the country's security forces of responding with a campaign of arson and murder in a bid to force them out of Myanmar.
READ MORE: Who are the Rohingya?
Stripped of their citizenship by the military government in the 1980s, more than 50 percent of the beleaguered ethnic group have been forced to neighbouring countries. Now, fewer than one million remain.
The Rohingya, a minority Muslim group who have lived in Myanmar's Rakhine State for centuries, have suffered decades of repression under the country's Buddhist majority.
The UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has warned of the risk of ethnic cleansing, appealing to the country's civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi and the country's security forces to end the violence.
But with the violence showing no end in letting up - the new influx of refugees is overwhelming camps in Bangladesh that were already bursting at the seams.
Al Jazeera spoke with Vivian Tan, a spokesperson for the UN's refugee agency (UNHCR), about the mass exodus of Rohingya Muslims and the body's response to the crisis.
Al Jazeera: Does the UN have the resources to look after 270,000 new refugees?
Vivian Tan: No, we don't, not at this point. The numbers are immense and they just keep growing.
Over the last few days, different UN agencies and NGOs went to affected areas to do a rapid means assessment and we reached out to areas we were not previously aware were hosting refugees.
It was here that we found these pockets of new arrivals - in villages and in spontaneous settlements sprouting on the side of the road.
So no, we don't have enough resources, and based on this rapid needs assessment we will get a clearer picture of what we need and appeal for funds.
Al Jazeera: Can you describe the cases of some of the refugees you've come across?
Vivian Tan: We're consistently told by most of the arriving refugees: ""My home was burned, or my village was burnt.""
We're often told that a helicopter came and dropped something onto their village, and a number of them reported shootings, but it still isn't clear if they were targeted shootings or shootings to scare people away. Some said they lost family members.
In terms of how they fled, most reported walking for several days. The minimum I've heard is three days and the maximum is nine.
They said they hid in jungles, in mountains, and they helped each other because of the difficult conditions. And there were also quite a few stories about babies being born along the way.
I was in Shamlapur a few days back, a seaside area some 7km from the border, and I came across a family who had a baby in the jungle as they were hiding.
And yesterday [Thursday], at the Nayapara camp in Teknaf, a father approached a clinic we were at looking very worried, gesturing ""come-come"".
We came out and he took us to this little basket covered by a blanket. I thought this could be chickens or vegetables, but he opened it up and showed us two tiny, babies. His wife had just given birth to twins while they were on the run.
There are a lot of really heartbreaking stories.
OPINION: Aung San Suu Kyi does not deserve the Nobel Peace Prize
Al Jazeera: What's the situation for children in the camps?
Vivian Tan: We're seeing a worryingly high number of unaccompanied children and separated children.
Many have either lost their parents in the violence or along the way as they fled. Some are with aunts or neighbours. Others, however, are completely alone.
We are trying really hard, working with volunteers and NGOs to identify them and take them to special protected spaces.
There are NGOs like Action Against Hunger, who are providing hot meals and supplementary foods and nutritional assessments, but there are so many weak and malnourished children.
Sadly, it's not just from the journey - many of them hadn't eaten for days before they left.
Al Jazeera: What's your assessment of how refugees have been treated?
Vivian Tan:What's really been surprising and heartening is the local response. In areas such as Shamlapur and Teknaf, villages are just taking them in.
One village took in around 10,000 people in a few days, and they continue to accept them, feed them and provide for them.
Even in Cox's Bazar town, which is quite far from the refugee camps, people have rallied together, collecting food, money and bringing it to the new arrivals.
The public response has been very encouraging in spite of Bangladesh hosting Rohingya for decades.
One would expect ""host-fatigue"" but the locals have really rallied around these new arrivals.
But at some point their own resources are going to run low or completely run dry, we think it's not only important to help these new arrivals but also provide support for the host community.
WATCH: Exclusive - 'Strong evidence' of genocide in Myanmar (48:15)
Al Jazeera: What is your biggest concern in terms of the refugees' rights, and their ability to be protected?
Vivian Tan:We're looking at this at two levels right now: immediate needs - and this involves saving lives, giving people food, water and a roof over their heads and medical attention if they need it.
We're currently talking to the authorities about purchasing more land because if it continues like this, it's going to be a big mess.
It's going to give rise to health issues, serious overcrowding and even tensions between the locals, so it needs to be managed better.
And then there's the second issue, legal protection, which includes registration.
Even the 270,000 number the UN came out with today is just a rough estimate. Until we do a headcount, a proper registration and document them, we won't know home many are here, who's looking after them and what they need.
By documenting them, they'll be better protected here in Bangladesh. Should they get stopped by the police or anyone else, they'll have the evidence to prove they're a refugee and they're here legally.
And in the long run, if and when conditions improve in Myanmar, if there's a chance of voluntary return, we will need this information to send it to the government so they can start discussing repatriation.
In the short, and long term, it's crucial they get their documents so they can retain their identity.

According to estimates issued by UN workers in Bangladesh's border region of Cox's Bazar, arrivals since the latest bloodshed started two weeks ago have already reached 146,000.
Numbers are difficult to establish with any certainty because of the turmoil as Rohingya escape operations by Myanmar's military.
However, UN officials have raised their estimate of the total expected refugees from 120,000 to 300,000, said Dipayan Bhattacharyya, who is Bangladesh spokesman for the World Food Programme (WFP).
""They are coming in nutritionally deprived, they have been cut off from a normal flow of food for possibly more than a month,"" he told Reuters news agency. ""They were definitely visibly hungry, traumatised.""
READ MORE: Myanmar - Who are the Rohingya Muslims?
The surge of refugees, many sick or wounded, has strained the resources of aid agencies and communities that are already helping hundreds of thousands displaced by previous waves of violence in Myanmar. Many have no shelter, and aid agencies are racing to provide clean water, sanitation and food.
Bhattacharyya said the refugees were now arriving by boat as well as crossing the land border at numerous points.
Another UN worker in the area cautioned the estimates were not ""hard science"" given the chaos and lack of access to the area on the Myanmar side, where the military is still conducting its ""clearance operation"".
The source added the 300,000 number was probably the worst-case scenario.
The latest violence began when Rohingya fighters attacked dozens of police posts and an army base. The ensuing clashes and a military counter-offensive killed at least 400 people and triggered the mass exodus of villagers to Bangladesh.
An Al Jazeera producer - on a government-arranged visit in Rakhine state - has visited several villages belonging to both Rohingya and non-Muslims.
""She says she's seen levels of destruction that are unimaginable. All the villages have been destroyed,"" reported Al Jazeera's Florence Looi from Myanmar's capital, Naypyidaw. ""We are hearing reports that fighting is still going on.""
UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric said on Wednesday from New York that the WFP is appealing for $11.3m to support the influx of people and those already living in camps. Dujarric described women and children arriving there as ""hungry and malnourished"".
The crisis in restive Rakhine state is the biggest to face Myanmar's leader Aung San Suu Kyi, and her handling of it has been a source of disillusionment among the democracy champion's former supporters in the West.
In a statement on Wednesday, she blamed ""terrorists"" for ""a huge iceberg of misinformation"" on the strife in Rakhine. She made no mention of the Rohingya who have fled.

Myanmar's National Security Adviser Thaung Tun said the group that attacked 30 police posts two weeks ago is trying to carve out a separate Muslim state from the Buddhist-majority nation, and the armed forces are using maximum restraint in their operations against them.
Based on the prediction that 300,000 could arrive in Bangladesh, the WFP calculated it would need $13.3m in additional funding to provide high-energy biscuits and basic rice rations for four months.
Bhattacharyya called for donors to meet the shortfall urgently.
""If they don't come forward now, we may see that these people would be fighting for food among themselves, the crime rate would go up, violence against women and on children would go up,"" he said.

EU countries agreed in September 2015, at the height of Europe's migrant crisis, to relocate 160,000 refugees from Greece and Italy over two years. Yet, only approximately 27,700 people have been moved so far.
Slovakia and Hungary's legal action, which was seeking to have the refugee-sharing scheme annulled, was struck out on the grounds that current EU policy is ""proportionate"", a European Court of Justice (ECJ) statement said on Wednesday.
The long-awaited ruling added: ""The mechanism actually contributes to enabling Greece and Italy to deal with the impact of the 2015 migration crisis.""
The court's decision is final and not open to appeal. As a result, European Commission (EC) officials will continue to be able to order member state governments to take in specific quotas of refugees entering the bloc, or risk facing fines.
EU REFUGEE-SHARING SCHEME, BY THE NUMBERS:
According to the UN refugee agency, 125,240 refugees have made the Mediterranean crossing to Europe so far this year - mainly to Italy and Greece.
That is significantly down from the 2016 total of 362,753 and a massive drop compared with the 1,015,078 who arrived by sea during 2015.
That reduction has helped ease the pressure on Italy and Greece, but political strains are still evident.
At the height of the crisis, in 2015, EU leaders forced through a vote to relocate up to 160,000 refugees from Italy and Greece to new homes spread around the EU member states.
It was a bitterly contested policy. Hungary, Czech Republic, Romania and Slovakia all voted against a compulsory relocation scheme, but they were over-ruled.
The UK used a legal exemption to opt out of the scheme. A month after the vote, Poland elected a new right-wing government which promptly refused to cooperate with the EU plan.
But in reality, the prediction of 160,000 turned out to be an overestimate.
Only around 35,000 asylum seekers were actually eligible for relocation - because although Syrians and Eritreans, for example, qualify for asylum, Nigerians, for example, do not.
To date, approximately 27,000 of the eligible refugees have now been relocated. That's more than 75 percent, but countries' willingness to participate remains patchy.
Malta, Latvia and also Norway have taken in their full quota of refugees from Greece.
Finland, Lithuania and Luxembourg have achieved more than 80 percent of their quotas.
Austria, Hungary and Poland still have not accepted any asylum seekers.
The Czech Republic has not relocated anyone since August 2016. Slovakia has taken in just 16 refugees and Liechtenstein just 10.
The verdict was welcomed by top European officials.
""ECJ confirms relocation scheme valid. Time to work in unity and implement solidarity in full,"" said EU Migration Commissioner Dimitris Avramopoulos.
Ska Keller, the lead parliamentarian on the scheme, said the verdict means ""there is no excuse"" for EU states not to share refugees from Greece and Italy as they have committed to do.

German officials were also quick to announce their support for the ruling, with Sigmar Gabriel, the foreign minister, encouraging member states to act swiftly following the decision.
""It is right to clarify questions legally if there is doubt. But now we can expect all European partners to stick to the ruling and implement the agreements without delay,"" he said.
Slovakia's Prime Minister Robert Fico said his country respected the court's judgement, adding, however, that its critical stance on the quota system and the migrants ""has not changed at all"".
""We will continue to work on having solidarity expressed in different ways other than forcing [on us] migrants from other countries that don't want to be here anyway,"" he said.
Hungary strongly condemned the ECJ's verdict.
Peter Szijjartom, the nation's foreign minister, claimed the decision was made on political rather than legal considerations and ""jeopardises the security and future of all of Europe"".
""The Hungarian government considers today's decision by the European court to be appalling and irresponsible,"" he said.
INSIDE STORY: What's the EU's vision to address the refugee crisis?
Al Jazeera's Sonia Gallego, reporting from Budapest, confirmed Hungary is now seeking $470m of compensation for border reinforcements developed since the scheme was introduced, including razor wire fencing and the employment of 3,000 guards.
The EU has agreed to examine the request, though how Hungary reached the precise figure remains unclear.
The compulsory relocation scheme was backed by a majority of EU member states but was rejected by Slovakia, the Czech Republic, Romania and Hungary.
The UK used a legal exemption to opt out of it, while Poland, which accepted the plan, later refused to cooperate when a new right-wing government came to power.
Kati Piri, a member of the European Parliament for the Netherlands, predicted that disputes over migration would continue in the bloc regardless of the ECJ's ruling.
""The political battle has not yet been finished,"" she told Al Jazeera in Brussels.
""We know the European Union is divided on these issues, especially [between] the member states in the east, who would like to take in many less refugees, [and] the member states in the west,"" she added.
INSIDE STORY: Is the EU closer to solving the migration crisis?
The EU executive is now believed to be ready to institute court proceedings within weeks that could lead to fines for member states not complying with the scheme.
""If the member states that have not relocated at all or not for a long time do not change their approach in the coming weeks, we should then consider to take the last step in the infringement procedure, taking Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic to the ECJ,"" said Avramopoulos.
Slovakia is not included in the legal action. It recently agreed to host a few refugees.

Nearly 125,000 Rohingya refugees - mostly women and children - have crossed the border into Bangladesh in the past 11 days, fleeing a security sweep by Myanmar forces who have been torching villages in response to alleged attacks by Rohingya fighters.
Since the latest round of violence began on August 25, at least 400 people have been killed in the ensuing clashes and a military counter-offensive.
READ MORE: Persecution of all Muslims in Myanmar 'on the rise'
""The grievances and unresolved plight of the Rohingya have festered for far too long and are becoming an undeniable factor in regional destabilisation,"" Guterres told reporters at the United Nations headquarters in New York on Tuesday.
""The authorities in Myanmar must take determined action to put an end to this vicious cycle of violence and to provide security and assistance to all those in need,"" he added.
Guterres also urged the UN Security Council to press for calm, sending the 15-member body a rare letter saying that ""the international community has a responsibility to undertake concerted efforts to prevent further escalation of the crisis.""
Al Jazeera's James Bays, reporting from the UN headquarters in New York, said: ""There is a real concern from the UN about the humanitarian situation because of this human exodus and the sheer number of people crossing the border into Bangladesh.""
The UN chief last week had urged restraint by security forces to avoid a humanitarian catastrophe from the refugee exodus, but he stepped up the pressure on Tuesday.
The UN Security Council met last week to discuss the crisis, but there was no formal statement following the closed-door meeting.
""Following this letter by Guterres, we are likely to see another meeting of the council pretty soon,"" said Bays.
OPINION: Only international pressure can save Rohingya now
The UN's refugee agency, UNHCR, also voiced grave concern for the safety of Rohingya Muslims fleeing to Bangladesh.
""Some reported that their family members were burned, or shot or slashed to death,"" said Duniya Khan, UNHCR spokeswoman.
""During their flight, many fled into the jungles or mountains, hiding and walking for days before they reached land or river and to cross the border.""
She added: ""Some of them also told us that they've been walking for three days, and they didn't have anything to eat, other than the rain water or the water on grounds.""
The Rohingya are seen as illegal immigrants in mainly-Buddhist Myanmar and have suffered decades of persecution, according to rights groups.
They have been forced to live under apartheid-like restrictions on movement and citizenship.
The UN has repeatedly called on Myanmar to grant the Rohingya rights, and a recent UN report said the brutal crackdown against the Muslim minority could amount to crimes against humanity.
Guterres said on Tuesday that Myanmar's government must grant the Rohingya ""either nationality or at least, for now, a legal status that will allow them to have a normal life, including freedom of movement, access to labour markets, education and health services"".
READ MORE: Myanmar - Who are the Rohingya Muslims?
The UN children's agency, UNICEF, said 80 percent of the Rohingya refugees who had fled to Bangladesh were women and children.
In northern Rakhine state, UNICEF workers are unable to reach 28,000 children in need of care while work on clean water, sanitation and school repairs has been suspended, the aid agency said in a statement.
Myanmar says its security forces are fighting a legitimate campaign against ""terrorists"" responsible for a string of attacks on police posts and the army since last October.
Officials in the country blamed Rohingya attackers for the burning of homes and civilian deaths, but rights monitors and Rohingya fleeing to neighbouring Bangladesh say the Myanmar army is trying to force them out with a campaign of arson and killings.

Raed al-Salhi, who died on Sunday, was critically injured on August 9 when Israeli troops tried to arrest him during a pre-dawn raid at the Dheisheh refugee camp in Bethlehem.
Issa Qaraqe, who leads the Palestinian Committee for Prisoners' Affairs, called Salhi's death a ""war crime"" as he claimed the victim was shot at least five times.
""The young man died after being shot at close range,"" he told the Anadolu news agency. ""They could have arrested him without shooting him.""
Another resident of the camp, Aziz Arafeh, was also shot in the leg.
The Israeli army had claimed that the two Palestinians had attempted to flee the area.
The violence in August followed another fatal assault at the refugee camp in July, when Israeli troops killed 18-year-old Baraa Hamamda during a raid, according to a report by the Bethlehem-based Maan News Agency.
Qaraqe called for the formation of a fact-finding committee tasked with examining crimes ""frequently perpetrated [by Israeli security personnel] against Palestinian youths who are deliberately killed"".
In the weeks following his detention, Salhi - despite being unconsciousness - was placed under heavy security guard.
His family was denied visiting rights, according to Samidoun, a network group of activists working for Palestinian prisoner rights.
Israel's army said it was looking into the incident and was not immediately available to comment, according to the AFP news agency.
Raids are frequent in towns, villages, and refugee camps in the occupied West Bank, with the Israeli army claiming they are essential for security and intelligence gathering.
Palestinians say they are used to intimidate, coerce and collectively punish Palestinian communities who resist Israel's 50-year occupation.

Sunday's TV clash had been touted as Schulz's last chance to sway millions to his cause and halt a devastating popularity slide.
But polls following the 90-minute showdown gave Merkel, leader of the Christian Democratic Party (CDU) since 2000, a clear edge over Schulz, a former European Parliament chief and leader of the Social Democratic Union Party of Germany (SDP).
""Merkel came out as sure, Schulz was hardly able to land a punch. The candidate is an honourable man. But being honourable alone won't make one chancellor,"" wrote Heribert Prantl, Sueddeutsche daily commentator.
There will be no further televised debates in the run-up to the election.
With millions of voters still undecided, Schulz had been looking to the debate to erode the commanding 17-percentage point lead of Merkel's CDU party and their Bavarian CSU allies ahead of the September 24 polls.
Schulz, who had previously complained that Merkel was lulling voters to sleep with her refusal to engage in combative debate, went on the offensive quickly on the hot-button issue of migration.
He accused Merkel of failing to coordinate plans with EU neighbours when she decided to open Germany's borders in 2015 to allow in refugees, many from war-torn Syria and Iraq.
But Merkel was not rattled, countering that: ""In the life of a chancellor, there are moments when you have to make a quick decision"".
And as Schulz voiced his wish to end EU membership talks with Turkey amid escalating tensions with Ankara, Merkel stole the issue from under his feet as she said she did not ""see them ever joining"" the bloc.
Together with EU counterparts, she will examine if ""we can end these membership talks"", Merkel said.
Merkel's tough line comes after Ankara arrested two more German nationals for ""political reasons"", according to Berlin.
The plunge in bilateral relations began after Germany sharply criticised Ankara over the crackdown that followed last year's failed coup attempt there.
The pair also debated security, with Merkel saying Germany has learned from past mistakes regarding how to prevent attacks.
""Over 90 minutes of debate, [Schulz] went on the offensive against Angela Merkel and her actions as chancellor,"" said Al Jazeera's Dominic Kane, reporting from Berlin.
""Opinion polls suggested that viewers thought although Schulz had been more aggressive, they thought Merkel had been more competent and more persuasive.""
Opinion polls following the programme showed a clear victory for Merkel, with public broadcaster ARD saying 55 percent found her more convincing while 35 percent plumped for Schulz.
A ZDF survey was closer but still had Merkel ahead with 32 percent, against 29 percent who thought Schulz performed better.
Merkel ""appeared to be more competent than in any previous duel. She was not brilliant, but sure. Schulz, on the other hand, was so stiff and dowdy, like Merkel was in previous duels"", wrote Prantl.
Munich's Merkur daily also noted that ""in an increasingly uncertain world which is led by testosterone-filled leaders, people don't know what Schulz wants. But they know what Merkel can do.""
Members of Merkel's party feted the results, with Julia Kloeckner tweeting: ""Angela Merkel: Stateswoman. Schulz: election candidate.""
But Schulz's Social Democrats equally applauded the man who is known to be a fiery orator.
Manuela Schwesig, Mecklenburg-Pomerania state premier said: ""Martin Schulz has shown that he can be chancellor.""
Sunday's so-called television duel between the election campaign's two leading candidates is a highlight of Germany's electoral campaign season.
A poll published earlier Sunday by Bild am Sonntag said close to 30 percent of Germans believe that the TV debate would have a strong impact on the campaign, while 52 percent thought it would only have limited impact.
Having already fought three previous general elections, the famously cautious Merkel is no stranger to the TV format.
But this was the first time that she has prevailed, with surveys immediately after each of the previous three editions showing a popularity bounce for her opponents.

The figures from the International Organization for Migration (IOM) on Wednesday came amid increasing concerns by the international community.
Foreign governments and organisations fear Rohingya villages are being subject to collective punishment after an armed group on August 25 attacked police posts and an army base in Rakhine state.
The attacks - in which at least 110 were killed - were claimed by the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA), a group which was formed by Rohingya living in Saudi Arabia after a bout of serious communal violence in 2012, according to the International Crisis Group.

In the days following the attacks, the Myanmar army has burned down areas of Rakhine state and fired on civilians, according to rights groups and witnesses.
Scores have reportedly been killed. Al Jazeera has been unable to verify the death tolls.
While Rohingya Muslims have largely fled to Bangladesh, Rakhine Buddhists have mostly sought sanctuary in towns and monasteries to the south and east of the fighting.
""As of last night, 18,500 people have come across"" from Myanmar's Rakhine state, Chris Lom, the IOM's Asia-Pacific spokesman, told the AFP news agency.
Lom said exact figures were difficult to obtain because many of those who have made it into Bangladesh might not register with local authorities.
""We also know there are people stuck at the border but we do not know how many,"" Lom said.
Bangladesh, which already hosts some 400,000 Rohingya who have fled Myanmar over the years, has vowed to block new arrivals and has deported some of those it has caught trying to make the crossing.
""They are in a very, very desperate condition,"" said Sanjukta Sahany, who runs the IOM office in the southern town of Cox's Bazar near the border.
""The biggest needs are food, health services and they need shelter. They need at least some cover, some roofs over their heads.""
Sahany said many crossed ""with bullet injuries and burn injuries,"" and that aid workers reported that some refugees ""gave a blank look"" when questioned.
""People are traumatised, which is quite visible.""
The UN, while condemning the attacks by ARSA, has pressured Myanmar to protect civilian lives without discrimination and appealed to Bangladesh to admit those fleeing the military counteroffensive.
Northern Rakhine has been under lockdown since October last year when a previously unknown group of Rohingya fighters ambushed a series of border posts inside Myanmar.
That prompted a massive military response, leading to some 87,000 Rohingya fleeing to Bangladesh, bringing with them harrowing tales of murder, rape and burned villages.
The UN believes the Myanmar government's response to the crisis may amount to ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity.
Satellite data recently accessed by Human Rights Watch show widespread fires burning in at least 10 areas in Rakhine.

Residents and activists have accused soldiers of shooting indiscriminately at unarmed Rohingya men, women and children and carrying out arson attacks.
However, authorities in Myanmar say close to 100 people have been killed since Friday when armed men, reportedly from the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA), launched a pre-dawn raid on police outposts in the restive region.
Myanmar authorities say Rohingya ""extremist terrorists"" have been setting the fires during fighting with government troops, while Rohingya have blamed soldiers who have been accused of carrying out extrajudicial killings.

A government spokesperson could not be immediately reached for comment.
""The Burmese government should grant access to independent monitors to determine the sources of fires and assess allegations of human rights violations,"" the Human Rights Watch (HRW) said in a statement on Tuesday.
The overall area in which burnings were found is 100 kilometres in length, approximately five times larger than the area where burnings by Burmese security forces occurred from October to November 2016, Human Rights Watch said.
In that period data from the group suggested some 1,500 buildings were destroyed.
The locations of the fires correlate with some witness statements and media reports describing blazes deliberately set, the group said.
""This new satellite data should cause concern and prompt action by donors and UN agencies to urge the Burmese government to reveal the extent of ongoing destruction in Rakhine State,"" Phil Robertson, HRW's deputy Asia director, said in a statement.
""Shuffling all the blame on insurgents doesn’t spare the Burmese [Myanmar] government from its international obligations to stop abuses and investigate alleged violations.""
Antonio Guterres, the UN secretary-general, ""is deeply concerned at the reports of civilians being killed,"" according to a statement from spokesman Stephane Dujarric.
Guterres called on Bangladesh to step up assistance to civilians escaping the violence, noting ""many of those fleeing are women and children, some of whom are wounded"".
More than 3,000 Rohingya have arrived in Bangladesh from Myanmar, where the Muslim ethnic minority faces persecution, in the past three days, the UN refugee agency UNHCR said on Monday.
The top UN human rights official called on authorities to ensure that the security forces refrain from using disproportionate force against Rohingya.
Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, condemned coordinated attacks by rebels on security forces last Friday, but said that the political leadership had a duty to protect all civilians ""without discrimination"".

Bangladesh has said there are thousands more Rohingya Muslims massed on its border with Myanmar, where it has stepped up patrols and pushed back hundreds of civilians who have tried to enter.
On Monday, Bangladesh detained and forcibly returned at least 90 Rohingya refugees back to Myanmar.
About 87,000 refugees entered Bangladesh in 2016 following the military crackdown.
The UN believes the army's response may amount to ethnic cleansing, allegations denied by the government of Aung San Suu Kyi and the army.
Meanwhile, Bangladesh has proposed joint military operations with Myanmar against Rohingya fighters in Rakhine state.
At the weekend, as violence in Rakhine worsened, Bangladesh's foreign minister summoned Myanmar's charge d'affaires in Dhaka to express ""serious concern"" at the possibility of a fresh refugee influx. There are already almost 400,000 Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh in squalid camps near its border with Myanmar.
In a goodwill gesture, the Thai prime minister on Tuesday said his country was preparing to receive people fleeing fighting in Myanmar.
""Thailand's defence ministry and security are preparing to receive various displaced people,"" Prayuth Chan-ocha told reporters. ""We will provide them with shelter like in the past ... and send them back when they are ready.""

French President Emmanuel Macron has invited his counterparts from Niger and Chad as well as the head of the Libyan UN-backed government Fayez al-Sarraj, whose countries lie on the main transit route for people fleeing violence and poverty in parts of Africa and the Middle East.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Spanish and Italian Prime Ministers Mariano Rajoy and Paulo Gentiloni, and Europe's top diplomat Federica Mogherini will join Monday's talks.
Some 125,000 people have crossed the Mediterranean by boat this year, according to UN figures, with the vast majority arriving in Italy before travelling on to other European Union members. An estimated 2,400 have died en route.
Al Jazeera's Natacha Butler, reporting from Paris, said the focus of the meeting was on the central Mediterranean route.
""What Macron says is that he wants to see more border controls in Africa, more patrolling of the waters off the coast of Libya and more development aid for Africa,"" Butler said.
""His argument is that fewer people would be fleeing poverty if those countries were stabilised and had more opportunities.""
In July, Macron also proposed - without consulting his allies - the creation of so-called ""hot spots"" in Africa where asylum seekers fleeing persecution or war could lodge a request to travel to the EU.
The comment prompted confusion, and his office later downplayed the remark.
The meeting might also provide insight into why arrivals have plummeted in recent weeks from Libya, the main route into Europe since a separate pathway from Turkey into Greece was shut down in 2016.
The numbers arriving in Italy have fallen by around 50 percent in July and August compared with last year.
OPINION: Who is really responsible for deadly refugee journeys?
Possible reasons include improved action by the Libyan coastguard, tougher border controls in transit countries inland, as well as Libyan militias joining efforts to stop boats leaving.
Niger President Mahamadou Issoufou will tell his European counterparts that the number of migrants passing through the transit town of Agadez in his country has fallen by 80 percent thanks to government efforts, a source in his team told AFP news agency.
Libya has also sought to restrict the work of NGOs operating rescue boats in the Mediterranean that pick up migrants stranded on inflatable dinghies or other unseaworthy crafts.
READ MORE: German NGO halts refugee rescue operations off Libya
Italy has also sought to impose a code of conduct on the NGOs, which face accusations from some critics that their operations have encouraged migrants to attempt the crossing with the knowledge that they will be picked up in an emergency.
The code has been signed by five of seven NGOs with rescue ships; only the French organisation Doctors Without Borders and Germany's Sea-Watch have refused as a matter of principle, saying they want to maintain their independence.
The code is set to be approved by all the countries attending Monday's meeting, according to the Italian news agency ANSA.
Commenting on the drop in arrivals, Al Jazeera's Butler noted, however, that ""there is another side to the story"".
""There are reports from migrants who talk about being turned back at borders by armed groups, without actually identifying them,"" she said.
""There have also been reports in British media that perhaps some Italian officials have been paying people smugglers to keep the migrants back in Libya and not send them over.
""The Italian government has denied that claim, but it does raise the question how those figures have so dramatically tumbled.""

George Okoth-Obbo, the number two official at the UN's refugee agency (UNHCR), said food and clothing was needed for the 1.4 million in the volatile Kasai region who have fled their homes in violence that has killed more than 3,000 people.
""Immediate protection"" was required, he told AFP news agency on the last day of a three-day visit to the country, in particular for children ""who are sleeping in conditions that are difficult to imagine"".

In Kasai, violence erupted last September after the death of a tribal chieftain, known as the Kamwina Nsapu, who rebelled against the authority of President Joseph Kabila's government in Kinshasa and its local representatives.
The killing sparked violence that has escalated, including alleged violations of human rights such as extrajudicial killings, rapes, torture and the use of child soldiers.
In August, the UN released a report, saying more than 250 people, including 62 children, were killed in Congo from mid-March to mid-June.
The report was based on interviews from 96 refugees who had fled the country's Kasai provinces into neighbouring Angola.
OPINION: Congo - A dictator's dilemma
According to the UN's Okoth-Obbo, about 33,000 Congolese have fled the region for Angola, and ""the conditions today in Kasai are such that we cannot encourage or promote the return of refugees"".
Okoth-Obbo added that the country is also having to cope with the arrival of about 500,000 refugees fleeing fighting in Burundi, Rwanda, South Sudan and the Central African Republic - where about 60,000 people have fled to Congo this year.

Rohingya leaders in Bangladesh told AFP news agency on Wednesday that at least 3,500 had arrived in recent weeks, piling pressure onto already overcrowded refugee camps in the Cox's Bazaar area near the Naf river that divides the two countries.
That is despite stepped-up patrols by Bangladeshi border and coast guards, who said this week they had pushed back a boat carrying 31 Rohingya, including children.
""In the Balukhali camp alone, some 3,000 Rohingya arrived from their villages in Rakhine,"" said Abdul Khaleq, referring to the camp nearest the river, where most of the migrants stay when they first arrive.
Kamal Hossain, a Rohingya elder in another, camp, said nearly 700 families had arrived in Bangladesh in the past 11 days.
Many were sleeping in the open because there was no more space in the camps, he said.
On August 12, authorities in Myanmar sent hundreds of troops into Rakhine in to boost security, drawing criticism from UN special rapporteur Yanghee Lee, who warned the deployment was ""cause for major concern"".
Rakhine, in northern Myanmar, has been gripped by violence since October, when armed men attacked police posts.
Following the incident, Myanmar authorities have reportedly cracked down on the Rohingya community, which the United Nations believes may amount to ethnic cleansing of the Muslim minority group.
Deen Mohammad, another Rohingya man who entered Bangladesh on August 13, said Muslim villagers in Rakhine were not allowed to visit neighbours without prior permission from the army.
The 45-year-old farmer said he left home with his family after the army killed his 23-year-old son for travelling to a nearby village.
Details of other alleged abuse last year have been recorded by the UN, which has documented mass gang rape, killings, including of babies and children, brutal beatings and disappearances. Rohingya representatives have said approximately 400 people were slain during the security forces' operation in October.
Myanmar launched its own probe into possible crimes in Rakhine and appointed former UN chief Kofi Annan to head a commission tasked with long-simmering divisions between Buddhists and Muslims.
On Wednesday, Annan presented his report to President Htin Kyaw in the Myanmar capital of Naypyidaw. The report is expected to be made publicly available on Thursday.
Azeem Ibrahim, a senior fellow with the Center for Global Policy, told Al Jazeera that while the likely recommendations of Annan's report won't be controversial, the restrictions placed on the former UN chief during his investigation have been criticised by many.
""[Annan] was not permitted to look at any of the human rights violations, which would argue are the basis for the conflict and the tensions in the Rakhine district,"" Ibrahim said.
He added that those who have been sceptical of the advisory commission itself argue that it is just a way for Aung Sun Suu Kyi to ""pacify the global public opinion and try to demonstrate to the international community that she is doing what she can to resolve this issue, and it was just a mechanism to get sanctions [on Myanmar] lifted"".
Buddhist-majority Myanmar has long faced criticism for its treatment of the more than one million Rohingya who live in Rakhine, who are seen as interlopers from Bangladesh and are denied citizenship and access to basic rights.
Bangladesh estimates that nearly 400,000 Rohingya refugees are living in squalid refugee camps and makeshift settlements in Cox's Bazar.
They include more than 70,000 who arrived in the months that followed the crisis in October, many bringing stories of systematic rape, murder and arson at the hands of Myanmar soldiers.
But Rohingya are also increasingly unwelcome in Muslim-majority Bangladesh, where police often blame them for crimes such as drug trafficking.
Dhaka has floated the idea of relocating tens of thousands of Rohingya refugees to a remote, flood-prone island off its coast, despite opposition from rights groups.
On Wednesday, the UN refugee agency said it was ""deeply concerned"" by the reports of a boat carrying Rohingya being turned back.
""UNHCR is deeply concerned by this incident, which as the coastguard reported, involved women and children who said they were fleeing violence,"" an agency spokesman told AFP.

Two members of the Palestinian group Fatah were killed on Wednesday during clashes with other armed groups in the Ain al-Hilweh refugee camp, according to medical sources.
The fighting began last Thursday after the leader of an armed faction sympathetic to the Bilal Badr group fired at the headquarters of the joint security force for the camp.
Since then, fighters have clashed with the joint security force comprising the main Palestinian factions, including Fatah, which is responsible for the camp's security.

The Bilal Badr group has been described by the Lebanese government as an ""Islamist group"", with a number of factions supporting its wanted leader.
The fighting escalated on Wednesday, when gunfire wounded three people, including two Lebanese security personnel, outside of the camp, according to a security source.
Al Jazeera's Imtiaz Tyab, reporting from Beirut, said that ""essentially, what we are seeing here [Ain al-Hilweh] is a turf war"".
""There are people who are trying to fight over these very narrow lanes and streets of this refugee camp, which is home to around 50,000 Palestinian refugees.""
The two sides agreed to a ceasefire deal later on Wednesday, but Tyab said such agreements ""continue to unravel"".
A witness told Reuters news agency that a war calm prevailed over the camp on Wednesday, with parts of the area suffering severe destruction.
Houses were burned, and the camp's water and electricity networks were damaged, other witnesses said.
Al Jazeera's Tyab said that the camp ""is a very densely populated and poverty-stricken place that has seen violence consistently for many years now"".
Palestinians in Lebanon are not allowed to own land and are prohibited from many professions, leading to a ""mix of uncertainty, unrest and poverty"", Tyab said.
Palestinians not allowed regular jobs or to own property. Latest fighting underscores how vulnerable refugees are, especially to violence
In April, seven people were killed and dozens were injured in similar fighting between the same two groups.
Lebanon's Palestinian camps, which date back to the 1948 war between Israel and its Arab neighbours, largely fall outside the jurisdiction of Lebanese security services.
There are some 450,000 Palestinian refugees living in 12 camps in Lebanon.

Far-right members of the Defend Europe group, who were aboard the C-Star vessel, said they were denied port access and a request for water to be sent out to the vessel, according to a statement on the group's Facebook page.
A government spokesman said the boat had not asked to dock in Malta, but indicated that such a request would have been rejected.
""They wanted to purchase services from here. There was never any kind of emergency,"" the spokesman told AFP news agency.

The spokesman also said that the boat ""was not welcome in Malta"" and that the island-state disagrees ""with all that [the boat] stands for"".
""Europe and Malta stand for solidarity and respect for human dignity,"" he told DPA news agency.
The snub was welcomed by local NGOs, who said in a joint statement that it sent a ""clear message against the politics of hate and extremism"".
The C-Star received similar cold-shoulder treatment from ports in Greece, Italy and Tunisia during its short-lived mission, which it ended on Thursday evening.
In the group's statement on Saturday, it accused Malta's government of ""supporting human trafficking and obeying international migration supporters"", adding that it was a ""historic disgrace"".
It launched a petition to call on Maltese government to allow the C-Star vessel to dock.
While the group said their month-long mission was successful, its crew was never able to act on its threats to take any distressed migrant and refugee boats it came across back to Libya - a move humanitarian organisations had warned would be in breach of international law.

The C-Star crew comprised 25 members of the Identitarian Movement, a pan-European conglomerate of activists who rally against Muslims and refugees.
The movement can be traced back to France in 2002 when the far-right Bloc Identitaire party established a youth wing.
Defend Europe said it had received more than $115,000 donations for its work.
More than 118,000 refugees and migrants have arrived in Italy, Greece, Cyprus and Spain by boat via the Mediterranean Sea this year, according to the International Organization for Migration (IOM).
More than 2,400 people have died at sea in 2017, the IOM also said.
Last week, a German aid group said it was suspending its refugee rescue operations in the Mediterranean over security concerns after Libya barred foreign vessels from a stretch of water off its coast.
Doctors Without Borders (known by its French initials, MSF) also said it was halting the use of its largest boat in the area because of an ""increasingly hostile environment for life-saving rescue operations"".

Two more suicide bombers detonated their devices at the gates to a nearby refugee camp, wounding many people, an emergency services official said.
The regional Emergency Agency said 45 people were ""critically injured"". The death toll could be as high as 30.
In all, at least 83 people were wounded in the three explosions near the city of Maiduguri, the epicentre of the long-running conflict between government forces and Boko Haram.
Nigeria's military last year wrested back large swaths of territory from the armed group. But they have struck back with renewed zeal since June, killing at least 143 people before Tuesday's bombings and weakening the army's control.

The group has waged an eight-year war to create an Islamic state in northeast Nigeria and provoked international outrage by kidnapping more than 200 schoolgirls known as the Chibok Girls in April 2014.
More than 80 of the nearly 200 schoolgirls who were still missing after a mass Boko Haram abduction in northeast Nigeria in 2014 were freed in May in exchange for prisoners.
Its better-known faction, led by Abubakar Shekau, has mainly based itself in the sprawling Sambisa forest and has been characterised by its use of women and children as suicide bombers targeting mosques and markets.
Fiyaso Soyomb, Editor of the International Centre for Investigative Reporting in Nigeria, told Al Jazeera that Boko Haram likes to use female suicide bombers because they are harder to detect.
""Following the trend of attacks, it's clear that there has been an upsurge since the release of [more than 80] girls in exchange for Boko Haram commanders - that's a big factor.""
A rival faction - based in the Lake Chad region, led by Abu Musab al-Barnawi and boasting ties to the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL, also known as ISIS) - has in the meantime quietly become a deadly force capable of carrying out highly-organised attacks.
Last month, an oil prospecting team was captured by al-Barnawi's group. At least 37 people, including members of the team, died when rescuers from the military and vigilantes attempted to free them.
The Boko Haram rebellion has killed 20,000 people and forced some 2.7 million to flee their homes in the last eight years.

UN deputy spokesman Farhan Haq told reporters that ""some people are reportedly attempting to leave the area, risking further danger and deprivation in an inhospitable desert location"".
Those remaining in the area, known as a berm, face a scarcity of food and healthcare, Haq said. In one section, called Hadalat, an estimated 4,000 people are reportedly living solely on flour and water, he said.

On Thursday, Syrian government forces and their allies captured a key area along the Jordan border in their latest push against rebel groups there.
Syrian state media said the capture closed major smuggling points used by rebels to bring weapons and fighters from Jordan into the war-torn country. Syrian state TV said government troops captured an area of 1,300 square kilometres in addition to some strategic hills.
Jordan closed its border with Syria in June 2016 after a car bomb attack by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL, also known as ISIS) group staged from near Rukban killed seven Jordanian border guards. Since then, international aid organisations have wrestled with the dilemma posed by sending aid to an off-limits area.
UN agencies agreed late last year to an aid system that critics say handed much of the control over aid distribution to Jordan's military and a Jordanian contractor and also involved armed men on the Syrian side.
Haq said on Monday that UN agencies ""are deeply concerned about the security and protection"" of the nearly 50,000 people stranded at the border.
""The UN calls on all parties to the conflict to take the necessary steps to prevent further harm to the frightened and highly vulnerable individuals stranded at the border,"" he said.
UN agencies are ready to continue supporting Jordanian authorities, despite limited resources, and ""immediately provide protection and additional life-saving assistance as needed,"" Haq said.

Deputy Interior Minister Kiren Rijiju told Reuters news agency over the weekend that the Rohingya living in India were illegal immigrants and must be deported.
""As far as we are concerned they are all illegal immigrants,"" Rijiju, a high-profile minister in Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Hindu nationalist government, said. "" They have no basis to live here. Anybody who is illegal migrant will be deported.""
Their registration with the UN refugee agency was irrelevant, he said.
READ MORE: Jammu - Right-wing groups try to evict Rohingya refugees
""We can't stop them from registering. But we are not signatory to the accord on refugees,"" he said.
Meenakshi Ganguly, Human Rights Watch's South Asia director, slammed the plan, noting that India as a member of the UN Human Rights Council was aware of the risks Rohingya refugees faced if deported.
""India was part of the council that authorised a fact-finding mission after tens of thousands of Rohingyas fled to Bangladesh from Mynamar, following a security operation in which hundreds were killed and raped,"" she told Al Jazeera.
""So India is aware of the risks of abuse, and India has an international obligation to protect them.""
The office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has issued identity cards to about 16,500 Rohingya in India, which it says helps ""prevent harassment, arbitrary arrests, detention and deportation"" of refugees.
The Rohingya are denied citizenship in Myanmar, despite claiming roots there that go back centuries.
Hundreds of thousands of Rohingyas have fled their homes since the first bout of violence was sparked in 2012. Since then they have live in despicable conditions in camps that The New York Times dubbed 21st-century concentration camps.
Thousands of Rohingyas were forced to flee to neighbouring Bangladesh after Myanmar security forces launched a crackdown in the wake of a deadly attack late last year. Many of them crossed the border into India. Others have also fled to southeast Asia, often on rickety boats run by people-smuggling gangs
Rijiju told parliament last week that the central government had directed state authorities to identify and deport illegal immigrants, including Rohingya.
HRW's Ganguly said she was worried that Rijiju's comments could encourage vigilante violence against the Rohingya community in India.
She also questioned the practicality of rounding up and expelling thousands of people scattered across the country.
The UNHCR's India office said it has not received an official word about a plan to deport Rohingyas, and had not received any reports of deportations taking place.
It said the principle of non-refoulement - or not sending back refugees to a place where they face danger - was considered part of customary international law and binding on all states whether they have signed the Refugee Convention or not.
OPINION: Myanmar needs to get serious about peace
India said on Friday it was in talks with Bangladesh and Myanmar about the deportation plan.
Rijiju, however, declined to comment on the deportation process.
""We can't throw them out just like that,"" he said. ""We can't dump them in the Bay of Bengal.""
Rohingya are generally vilified in India and over the past few months there has been a string of anti-Rohingya protests.
Right-wing groups in Indian-administered Kashmir have also been running a campaign against the Rohingya refugees.
The rumblings began last year, when India's ruling Bharatiya Janata Party, which runs a coalition government in Kashmir with the regional People's Democratic Party, began to raise the issue.

Sunday's announcement comes a day after Doctors Without Borders (MSF) said it was halting the use of its largest boat in the area because of an ""increasingly hostile environment for lifesaving rescue operations"" of asylum seekers.
In a statement, the aid group Sea Eye said it was with ""a heavy heart"" that it had decided to follow suit after the Libyan government's ""explicit threat against the private NGOs"".
Tensions have risen since the Libyan navy on Thursday ordered foreign vessels to stay out of a coastal search-and-rescue zone, a measure it said was specifically aimed at non-governmental groups.
Libyan authorities have accused charities of aiding human smugglers with their rescues at sea, hampering efforts to crack down on the migration route.
""Under these circumstances, a continuation of our rescue work is not currently possible. It would be irresponsible towards our crews,"" Sea Eye founder Michael Buschheuer said.
But he cautioned that the retreat of the aid groups was putting lives at risk.
""We leave behind a deadly gap in the Mediterranean,"" he warned.
Italian Foreign Minister Angelino Alfano, however, welcomed Libya's stepped-up efforts to curb the flow of desperate people.
The Libyan government ""is ready to put in place a search-and-rescue zone in its waters, work with Europe, and invest in its coast guards,"" Alfano told La Stampa daily on Sunday.
""This sends a signal that the balance is being restored in the Mediterranean.""
Italy, which has borne the brunt of Europe's migration crisis this year, has itself moved to rein in NGOs helping the multinational rescue operations by making them sign up to a new code of conduct.
Six years since a revolution that toppled longtime dictator Muammar Gaddafi, Libya has become a key departure point for people risking their lives to cross the Mediterranean to Europe.
Tens of thousands have resorted to paying people traffickers for the journey, often on overcrowded and unseaworthy boats.
Sea Eye says it has helped save some 12,000 lives since April 2016.

Hamed Shamshiripour, a 31-year-old Iranian national, was found near the East Lorengau refugee transit centre on Papua New Guinea's Manus Island on Monday.
The Australian immigration department said it was aware of the death and the Papua New Guinea authorities are investigating the matter.
The circumstances surrounding Shamshiripour's death are unclear.
But refugees on Manus are questioning initial reports that he had committed suicide after injuries were reportedly found on his body.

Shamshiripour's death has sparked outrage by other refugees and human rights groups who blame officials for failing to treat him despite a long history of mental illness.
Behrouz Boochani, a journalist and Iranian refugee who has been held on Manus Island since 2013, said on Twitter that eight months ago, refugees had sent a letter to authorities ""stating [Shamshiripour] needs medical treatment"".
He added that authorities ""did not care"".
There are currently more than 790 asylum seekers are being held on Manus Island, according to government data from July.
Under Australian law, anyone intercepted while trying to reach the country by boat is sent to detention centres on Manus Island or the Pacific island of Nauru for processing.
The Australian government maintains they will never be eligible to be resettled in Australia.
Rights groups, as well as the United Nations, have condemned the prison centres as inhumane.
Kon Karapanagiotidis, the chief executive of the Melbourne-based Asylum Seeker Resource Centre, said Shamshiripour ""would be alive today if an Oz hospital [got him] the urgent care he needed"".
Daniel Webb, the director of legal advocacy at the Human Rights Law Centre, called the asylum seeker's death an ""absolute tragedy"".
""This man deserved to be treated with basic decency and respect ... Instead, [the Australian] government chose to be cruel, imprisoning him indefinitely on a remote island in truly awful conditions,"" he said in a statement.

Shamshiripour is the fifth man held on Manus Island, and the seventh refugee in total, that has died while detained in offshore processing centres since the Australian government began the policy in 2013.
A Papua New Guinea court ruled last year that the detention centre on Manus was unconstitutional, and Australia is set to close it by the end of October.
Many at the detention prison have refused to leave the camp and go to transit centres such as the facility where Shamshiripour was being held out of fear the local population will attack them.
Refugees at the Manus Island prison camp had been protesting their treatment earlier this week following the leak of phone transcripts of a conversation between Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull and US President Donald Trump.
The two leaders discussed a refugee deal between Australia and Trump's predecessor Barack Obama that would resettle up to 1,250 asylum seekers held in offshore prisons.

Trump is heard telling Australian prime minister that the agreement is ""stupid"", while Turnbull calls on the US president to ""respect"" the deal, but implies that the agreement does not mean the US would have to take any refugees, only vet them.
Following Shamshiripour's death, rights groups called on the Australian government to ""immediately evacuate"" those being held on Manus and Nauru.
""Our government cannot guarantee their safety or that a single person will be resettled in America,"" the HRLC's Webb said.
""After four years of fear and violence and shootings and death, the only humane and responsible way forward is to immediately evacuate every single man, woman and child held on Nauru to Manus to safety.
""Otherwise, further tragedy is inevitable.""

The move from Barcelona to the French club, which is known as PSG, will also see the 25-year-old pocket $34m after taxes, making him the highest paid footballer in the world.
The fee is more than double the 105m euros ($124.7m) Manchester United agreed with Juventus to bring Frenchman Paul Pogba to northern England.
Nasser al-Khelaifi, PSG's president, said Neymar would help the club realise its ""greatest dreams"".
But for many on social media, the huge sum - as opposed to the prospects of trophies - is what has seen people dreaming.
Many pondered what they could buy for the Brazilian's price-tag, with ideas ranging from battalions of Challenger tanks and properties in London's most expensive areas, to the number of chocolate bars or cups of coffee.
Others thought about how such a sum could be used to alleviate problems, such as the ongoing Syrian refugee crisis.
Here, we list just some of what you could do with $263m at current prices:
Right Move, a property listing website, puts the average house price in London's most expensive area of Kensington at 1.47m British pounds ($1.91m).
Anxiety about housing is growing in the UK, with many young people unable to afford properties in the capital due to runaway house price inflation.
The Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) ranks as one of the best universities in the world, but studying there can set a student back around $65,000 a year in tuition fees and living costs.
Student debt in the United States is estimated at around $1.44 trillion.
Neymar has his work cut out trying to compete with a passenger airliner, with the price of one standard-sized jet costing between $224m and $300m depending on the model.
It costs India around $229 to provide primary education to a pupil for one year in one of its state schools.
Around 8.4 million children in the country are out of the education system.
According to the Wall Street Journal, the former US president received $260,000 for a speech in 2014 that lasted less than an hour.
Assuming the same rate, Neymar's transfer fee could buy 1,011 hours with the former US president, or 42 whole days.
With a proposed budget for 2018 of $639.1bn, Neymar's transfer fee would allow the US military to operate for a few hours.
The US has the largest military budget in the world, followed by China at $215bn.
Just over 2.25 percent of global GDP goes to military spending, according to the World Bank.
The 1335-acre Greek island of Dulichium is currently on sale for $44m.
The IMF estimates 2 percent of global GDP each year is lost to corruption, or roughly between $1.5 trillion and $2 trillion.
Neymar's fee would barely make a dent in recovering this money, at 0.013 percent.
The Kilis Oncupinar facility is home to around 14,000 refugees fleeing the war in Syria and costs around $2m a month to operate.
Neymar's former Barcelona teammate has a release clause in his contract of around 300 million euros ($354m).

On Wednesday, around 7,000 people, including members of Jabhat Fateh al-Sham, were escorted by the Lebanese Red Cross. They were received by the Syrian Red Crescent after crossing the border.
The agreement follows the capture of the border area by Hezbollah with support from Syrian warplanes and involves the release of Hezbollah fighters held by Jabhat Fateh al-Sham, which was previously known as al-Nusra Front.
Fighting flared up in July when Hezbollah launched an operation to capture the area from Syrian armed groups.
Security sources say that about 1,000 Jabhat Fateh al-Sham fighters are among those who left the area for Idlib aboard dozens of buses.
Al Jazeera's Imtiaz Tyab, reporting from Beirut, said the events were a culmination of a very complex deal.
""The deal involved a number of phases, which included the exchange of the remains of the fighters on each side, and this very large evacuation and prisoner release,"" he said.
However, in an interview to Al Jadeed, a Lebanon-based TV station seen as close to the government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, a Lebanese General Security official estimated the number of fighters to be much lower.
""What we know is 120 fighters,"" Major-General Abbas Ibrahim said.
Arsal and its neighbouring areas are home to around 100,000 Syrian refugees, who have fled fighting between rebel and government forces.
The war began when government troops opened fire on pro-democracy protesters in early 2011 but quickly turned into an armed conflict involving dozens of armed groups, and later foreign forces.
Hezbollah entered the conflict in support of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and has taken part in offensives on both sides of the border.
The country is currently divided between the Syrian government, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL, also known as ISIS) group, rebel factions, and Kurdish fighters backed by US troops.
As well as support from Hezbollah and its Iranian backers, Assad has the support of Russian forces and Iraqi Shia fighters.
The conflict has resulted in one of the most severe refugee crises since World War II with nearly five million people fleeing the country since 2011, according to the UNHCR.
The war has claimed up to 470,000 lives, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based campaign group that documents the death toll.

The move by the renegade general, Khalifa Haftar, which was announced on Wednesday, comes after Italy instructed its navy to stop refugee boats heading to Europe from Libya.
An Italian naval ship, Commandante Borsini, entered Libyan waters on Wednesday.
Italy initially hoped to send six ships into Libyan waters but had to downsize the mission after objections from the administration in Tripoli.
Haftar, who controls most of eastern Libya, said the order was applicable to bases in Benghazi, Ras Lanuf and Tobruk as well as the capital Tripoli, in the west, which he does not control.
Italy sent the mission to help Libya's coastguard curb the flow of refugees and asylum seekers after a request by the UN-backed Government of National Accord (GNA) in Tripoli.
Paolo Gentiloni, Italy's premier, said Italy's deployment responded to a request by the GNA, which later denied striking a deal with the Italians.
Libya's eastern-based parliament, rivals to Tripoli and allied with Haftar, strongly opposed the move.
Returning refugees and asylum seekers back to Libya amounted to ""exporting the illegal migration crisis to Libya"", it said.
The development signals unresolved tensions between Haftar and Fayez Serraj, the GNA prime minister, who pledged to cooperate at a meeting outside Paris last week.
At the meeting hosted by French President Emmanuel Macron last week, Haftar and Serraj committed themselves to a ceasefire, to work toward presidential and parliamentary elections, and to establish a roadmap to secure Libya against ""terrorism"" and ""trafficking of all kinds"".
Al Jazeera's Mahmoud Abdelwahed, reporting from Tripoli, said Haftar's ability to translate his threats into action is open to question.
""Haftar does not have a military presence in the west and especially in the Libyan capital, Tripoli,"" he said, adding that forces loyal to Haftar near Tripoli would meet with resistance if they made any attempt to reach GNA-controlled ports.
He said the EU and the US are helping Tripoli-controlled government forces monitor Libyan waters and airspace.
""Haftar doesn't have navy forces in the west. The only ships he controls are in the east, off the Mediterranean oil ports and Benghazi,"" Al Jazeera's Abdelwahed said.
""With the Sophia delegation monitoring Libyan waters, Haftar cannot move his ships.""
Operation Sophia is an EU mission to stop people trafficking and arms smuggling in Libya.
Officials hope boats being sent back to Libyan ports will have a powerful deterrent effect on would-be refugees and asylum seekers considering paying traffickers for passage to Europe.
The approach has been criticised by international rights groups who say people returned to troubled Libya face detention in squalid camps and abuse at the hands of traffickers.
""After years of saving lives at sea, Italy is preparing to help Libyan forces who are known to detain people in conditions that expose them to a real risk of torture, sexual violence, and forced labour,"" said Human Rights Watch's Judith Sunderland.
Hundreds of thousands of refugees and asylum seekers are brought to Italy each year from Libya in overcrowded boats that are often not seaworthy.
The Switzerland-based International Organization for Migration says 94,802 migrants have reached Italy this year.
At least 2,221 people have drowned this year while attempting to cross the Mediterranean Sea from Libya.
Libya descended into chaos following the 2011 civil war that toppled and killed Muammar Gaddafi and the country is now split between rival governments and militias.

Trump also told the Australian prime minister that a refugee deal struck between Australia and the United States prior to him taking office is ""a stupid deal"" that will make him ""look terrible"".
The Washington Post published on Thursday transcripts of calls Trump made to Mexico's Enrique Pena Nieto and Australia's Malcolm Turnbull just days after he took office on January 20.
The substance of the calls had previously been reported, but Al Jazeera's White House correspondent, Kimberly Halkett, said the transcripts reveal ""rare insights into a different style of diplomacy than we have typically seen from previous presidents"".
In a January 27 call with Pena Nieto, Trump pressured the Mexican president to avoid saying in public that Mexico would not fund the planned border wall.
The proposed wall, a Trump campaign promise aimed at preventing illegal immigration to the US, is a bone of contention between Mexico and Washington.
Pena Nieto has repeatedly rejected Trump's promise that Mexico will end up paying billions of dollars for its construction.
Trump told the Mexican leader in the call that ""if you are going to say that Mexico is not going to pay for the wall, then I do not want to meet with you guys any more because I cannot live with that"", according to the transcript.
""You cannot say that to the press,"" Trump said.
REPORTER'S NOTEBOOK: Can Donald Trump build a wall? And what else?
The White House has said the US government would pay for the wall initially to get the project off the ground but that Mexico will eventually reimburse it for the work.
In their phone conversation, Trump said both leaders were ""in a little bit of a political bind"" due to Trump's campaign pledge to build the wall and have Mexico foot the bill.
""I have to have Mexico pay for the wall - I have to. I have been talking about it for a two-year period,"" Trump said.
He suggested that the two men avoid the issue of paying for the wall when asked.
""They are going to say, 'Who is going to pay for the wall, Mr President?' to both of us, and we should both say, 'We will work it out,'"" Trump said.
Pena Nieto said he understood Trump's position on how to refer to paying for the border wall and suggested seeking ""a creative way to jump over this obstacle"", but reiterated that Mexico ""cannot pay for that wall"".
INTERACTIVE: Building Trump's border wall
Towards the end of their conversation, Trump responded effusively to a comment by Pena Nieto about the Mexican leader's wish for a constructive relationship with the US.
""Your words are so beautiful. Those are beautiful words, and I do not think I can speak that beautifully, okay?"" Trump said.
""I want you to be so popular that your people will call for a constitutional amendment in Mexico so that you can run again for another six years,"" he said. By law, Mexican presidents can only serve one six-year term.
Both the White House and Mexico's foreign ministry did not have any immediate comment on Thursday about the release of the call transcripts.
Speaking to Australia's Turnbull on January 28, Trump became irritated that the US was expected to honour an agreement made by his predecessor, Barack Obama, to accept as many as 1,250 refugees held in offshore prisons.
Trump said that would make him look bad given his campaign promises to reduce the number of refugees entering the US, according to the transcript.
""Boy, that will make us look awfully bad,"" Trump says. ""Here I am calling for a ban where I am not letting anybody in, and we take 2,000 people. Really it looks like 2,000 people that Australia does not want, and I do not blame you by the way, but the United States has become like a dumping ground,"" Trump said.
OPINION: Trump-Turnbull's dubious deal
""This is going to kill me. I am the world's greatest person that does not want to let people into the country,"" Trump said.
Turnbull countered, saying that ""this is a big deal, and I think we should respect deals"".
The US president also told Turnbull that their conversation was the most difficult he had held that day, after speaking to Russian President Vladimir Putin, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe among others.
""I have had it. I have been making these calls all day, and this is the most unpleasant call all day,"" Trump said. ""Putin was a pleasant call. This is ridiculous.""

Italy says its mission is backed by Libya's UN-recognised unity government based in Tripoli.
The Italian parliament on Wednesday gave the go-ahead to providing technical support to the Libyan coastguard in its fight against human traffickers in the hope it would reduce the number of people arriving on Italy's coasts.
Italy's defence minister insisted before the vote that the mission would not be a naval blockade, although legislators from the anti-migrant Northern League, an opposition party, demanded exactly that.

HRW said Italy risked preventing genuine asylum seekers from escaping from a country where migrants face detention in squalid camps and abuse at the hands of traffickers.
""The Italian navy deployment in Libyan waters could effectively lead to arbitrary detention of people in abusive conditions,"" said Judith Sunderland, HRW's Europe and Central Asia associate director.
""After years of saving lives at sea, Italy is preparing to help Libyan forces who are known to detain people in conditions that expose them to a real risk of torture, sexual violence, and forced labour.""
Such a move ""could implicate Italy in human rights abuses"".
Italy is expected to begin by sending a logistics ship and patrol boat as well as mechanics to maintain equipment.
Al Jazeera's Hoda Abdel-Hamid, reporting from Puglia in Italy, said the Italian government has issued a behavioural code, which it wants the 10 international nongovernmental organisations (NGOs) that rescue migrants in the Mediterranean Sea to sign.
""Only three out of 10 NGOs have accepted the code, which calls among other points for an armed police officer to be on board, and would forbid transporting any rescued migrant from one vessel to another vessel,"" she said.
The NGOs that are refusing to comply want some clarity on whether the new conditions are targeted at people smugglers or aimed at stopping the flow of migrants altogether.
Under human rights law, no one rescued or intercepted by an EU-flagged ship or under the control of an EU member state can be sent back to a place or handed over to authorities where they face a real risk of torture or ill-treatment.
""This includes pushbacks to Libya or handovers to Libyan forces and applies even if Italy rescues or interdicts people in Libyan territorial waters,"" HRW's Sunderland said.
""Even if the Italian navy simply provides intelligence to Libyan coastguard forces that leads to the foreseeable apprehension and detention of migrants in abusive conditions, Italy could share responsibility.
""Italy could also be implicated in denying people's right to leave any country and interfering with the right to seek asylum under the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights.""
Libya has not ratified the international refugee convention and does not have a functioning asylum system.
For its part, the Tobruk-based Libyan House of Representatives, which is allied to General Khalifa Haftar, has voiced strong opposition to the planned deployment of Italian navy vessels in Libya's territorial waters.
The legislators said such a move would be ""exporting the illegal migration crisis to Libya"" and that having a foreign navy's vessels patrolling Libyan waters would be a ""violation of the sovereignty of Libya"".
The parliament criticised the Tripoli-based government of Fayez Serraj, prime minister in the unity government, for striking the deal with the Italians.
Hundreds of thousands of people, most of them economic migrants ineligible for asylum, have been brought ashore in Italy after rescue in the last few years.
The migrant crisis looms as a campaign issue in Italy's 2018 elections.

Thousands of Syrians, including fighters, their families and refugees, are to leave the border zone and head for Syria's Idlib province under the agreement.
The Lebanese Al Manar television station said on Wednesday that 26 buses crossed further northeast from the Arsal area to Wadi Hmeid, in the direction of the Syrian border.
Al Jazeera's Imtiaz Tyab, reporting from Labweh, said the logistics of the long convoy would be challenging.
""The Lebanese Red Cross will escort this convoy to the border with Syria,"" he said.
""They will then be met by the Syrian Red Crescent, which will escort the convoy to Idlib province, a rebel-held area.
""That is where these refugees, these fighters and their families will be going, but we understand this could take many many hours.""
Nearly 7,000 Syrians are expected to leave the area under the ceasefire deal, according to Hezbollah-run news media outlets.
The deal also included the release of Hezbollah fighters by Jabhat Fateh al-Sham, formerly known as al-Nusra Front, which took place overnight.
The ceasefire took effect last week, just days after Hezbollah and the Syrian army launched an offensive to drive Jabhat Fateh al-Sham and other armed groups from their last foothold along the Syria-Lebanon border.

Under the deal between the opposition fighters and Hezbollah, about 9,000 rebels and their relatives were to leave to rebel-head areas in Syria in exchange for eight Hezbollah fighters held by the Jabhat Fateh al-Sham, formerly known as the al-Nusra Front.
The first step of the ceasefire, brokered by Lebanon's internal security agency, unfolded on Sunday as the two sides exchanged the bodies of dead fighters.
The deal includes the departure of all Jabhat Fateh al-Sham fighters from Lebanon's border region around the town of Arsal, along with any civilians in nearby refugee camps who wish to go.
READ MORE: Hezbollah makes gains in Syria-Lebanon border assault
The truce echoes deals struck within Syria in which Damascus has shuttled rebels and civilians to Idlib province and other opposition areas. Such evacuations have helped President Bashar al-Assad recapture several rebel bastions over the past year.
Speaking from Labweh, a Lebanese town near the border, Al Jazeera’s Imtiaz Tyab called the latest deal ""unprecedented"".
""This is the first time that we’re seeing a deal which would see such a large number of Syrian refugees and fighters who are opposed to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, and have been in open conflict with Hezbollah and Lebanese forces, exit the area and go to another area in Syria,"" he said.
Lebanon's Hezbollah has played a major role in fighting rebels along the frontier during Syria's six-year war, sending thousands of combatants to support Assad's government.
Last week, Hezbollah took most of the mountainous zone of Juroud Arsal in a joint offensive with the Syrian army to drive Jabhat Fateh al-Sham fighters from their last border foothold.
The Lebanese army, which receives considerable US and British military support, did not take an active part in the operation, setting up defensive positions around Arsal.
The next phase is expected to target a nearby enclave currently in the hands of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) group.
The UN refugee agency, not involved in the deal, was trying to reach refugees in the Arsal region to evaluate whether returns were voluntary, spokeswoman Lisa Abou Khaled said.
""UNHCR believes that conditions for refugees to return in safety and dignity are not yet in place in Syria,"" she said, with war continuing across large swaths of the country.
The multi-sided Syrian conflict has killed hundreds of thousands of people and driven at least 11 million from their homes - about half of Syria's pre-war population.
Nearly 1.5 million refugees have poured into Lebanon and they now make up around a quarter of the country's population. Most languish in severe poverty and several thousand live in makeshift camps east of Arsal.

The two Eastern European states - backed by neighbour Poland - had argued that the EU's 2015 scheme to have each member state host a certain number of refugees was unlawful.
The programme was designed to help ease pressure on asylum systems in Greece and Italy after mass arrivals across the Mediterranean.
But Yves Bot, the European Court of Justice's Advocate General, rejected most of the procedural arguments presented by Bratislava and Budapest, saying the resettlement scheme was ""appropriate for attaining the objective which it pursues"".
Europe has been grappling with the worst migration crisis since the end of World War II with an influx of people fleeing the wars in Syria and Iraq while others from Africa are seeking an escape from poverty or political persecution.
Also on Wednesday, the European Commission said it had stepped up its legal case against the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland over their efforts to block the relocation programme from going into effect.
""Despite repeated calls for action ... these three countries remain in breach of their legal obligations and have shown disregard for their commitments to Greece, Italy and other member states,"" the EU executive said.
In so-called ""reasoned opinions"", the Commission has now sent a formal request to these countries to apply EU rules, to which they have one month to respond.
Should the Commission not find the answers satisfactory, it can take the countries to court.

In 2015, more than a million refugees and migrants reached Europe by crossing the Mediterranean Sea, according to the United Nations refugee agency UNHCR.
Although arrivals by boat have decreased drastically since the European Union and Turkey reached a deal to stem the flow of refugees and migrants in March 2016, arrivals have not stopped.
The UNHCR says more than 112,000 people have reached Europe by Mediterranean so far this year, while at least 2,365 people died en route or are still missing at sea.

The attack killed 42 people and injured 34 of the 140-plus people on board, the investigators wrote to the UN Security Council on Monday in a 185-page report seen by Reuters news agency on Wednesday.
""This civilian vessel was almost certainly attacked using a 7.62mm calibre weapon from an armed utility helicopter,"" the report said.
""The Saudi Arabia-led coalition forces are the only parties to the conflict that have the capability to operate armed utility helicopters in the area.""
The document said the helicopter was likely to have been operating from a naval vessel.
The coalition battling the Houthi fighters in Yemen has denied striking the boat in the Red Sea near the port of Hodeidah.
Saudi Arabia and its allies, including Egypt, the UAE, Bahrain and Jordan, intervened in Yemen in 2015 in support of the internationally recognised government of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi.
The UN report said the attack violated international humanitarian law and threatened the peace, security and stability of Yemen.
It said two other alleged attacks on fishing vessels by helicopter or naval vessels in the Red Sea in March had killed 11 more people and injured eight.
It said the Saudi-led coalition, the governments of the UAE and Egypt and the Combined Maritime Forces had not responded to the investigators' requests for information.
The coalition receives US arms and logistical support.
""Some individual member states of the Saudi Arabia-led coalition seek to hide behind 'the entity' of the coalition to shield themselves from state responsibility for violations committed by their forces,"" the investigators said.
They did not identify the states by name.
""Attempts to divert responsibility in this manner from individual states to the Saudi Arabia-led coalition may contribute to further violations continuing with impunity,"" they wrote.
Akshaya Kumar, deputy United Nations director for Human Rights Watch, told Al Jazeera that HRW were calling on countries to stop selling the Saudi-led coalition weapons that were being used in violation of the rules of war, and that the UN should set up an independent mechanism to investigate these abuses.
""The [UN] security council has its own duy to act - it's received this information now,"" said Kumar.
""The panel of experts were unequivocal about their view of responsibility here, and so we'll have to see: will the council continue on its path of inaction or will they engage and publicly push the Saudi coalition to reform its practices and to hold those reponsible for this particular attack to account?""
Top UN officials this month accused the rival parties in Yemen and their international allies of exacerbating a deadly cholera outbreak, driving millions closer to famine and hindering humanitarian aid access.
UN-led peace talks have stalled. At the suggestion of Nikki Haley, the US ambassador, the Security Council is considering sending letters to the rival parties reminding them of their humanitarian obligations.
The letter has to be agreed by consensus and Egypt has objected to the draft, according to a senior Security Council diplomat.

Wednesday's report - titled Like Living in Hell - accuses police and riot squads of regularly using pepper spray on asylum seekers, including children, who do not pose a threat, such as while they are sleeping.
Officers have also confiscated or pepper sprayed asylum seekers' food, water, sleeping bags, blankets and clothes, the report added, saying that the conduct violates international standards of policing.
""It is reprehensible for police to use pepper spray on children and adults who are asleep or peacefully going about their day,"" said Benedicte Jeannerod, HRW's France director.
""When police destroy or take migrants' blankets, shoes, or food, they demean their profession as well as harm people whose rights they've sworn to uphold.""
French authorities have denied the accusations in the report, which relied on interviews with 61 people.
Fabien Sudry, prefect for the Pas-de-Calais region, said he ""categorically denied the false and defamatory allegations"" in the report, which he claimed, ""have no evidential basis"".
""Police, of course, operate in Calais respecting the rules of law, with the sole objective of ensuring public order and security,"" Sudry added.
For more than a decade France's northern coast has been a magnet for refugees and migrants trying to reach Britain.

In October last year, authorities dismantled the ""Jungle"", Calais' decrepit makeshift camp where thousands lived in the hope of climbing aboard trucks or trains to get across the English Channel.
But HRW said hundreds of asylum seekers and migrants, mostly Eritreans, Ethiopians and Afghans, are still living on the streets and in wooded areas in and around the port city.
""Every day, the police chase us. They use spray. They kick us. This is our life every day,"" said Waysira L, a 16-year-old boy from the Oromo community, an ethnic group in East Africa.
Earlier this month, French police evicted some 2,000 refugees and migrants who had been sleeping in the streets of Paris.
The newly-elected French President Emmanuel Macron has said he intends to overhaul the country's asylum system and install ""a more human, and fairer"" process.

At the same time a car bomb exploded in Idlib killing 11 people, the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitoring group said.
The latest developments come after the armed group Hay'et Tahrir al-Sham, which is dominated by a former al-Qaeda affiliate and known as HTS, agreed a ceasefire on Friday with Ahrar al-Sham rebels.
""Ahrar al-Sham withdrew from the city of Idlib which is now under the control of Hay'et Tahrir al-Sham,"" Observatory head Rami Abdel Rahman told AFP news agency.
READ MORE: Syria's civil war explained from the beginning
""Hundreds of rebels left the city aboard dozens of vehicles heading towards southern Idlib province,"" he said.
The truce ended a week of fierce fighting between HTS and Ahrar al-Sham, which is backed by Turkey and some Gulf countries, that killed at least 92 people including 15 civilians, the Observatory said.
Abdel Rahman said the HTS set up checkpoints across the northwestern city.
The fall of the city and provincial capital is symbolic.
It comes after HTS captured in a bloodless takeover ""more than 31 towns and villages"" across Idlib province over the past two days, the monitor said.
The HTS is dominated by the Fateh al-Sham faction, which was previously known as al-Nusra Front before renouncing its ties to al-Qaeda.
The HTS and Ahrar al-Sham were once allies and fought alongside each other to capture most of Idlib province from Syrian government forces in 2015.
The truce they agreed to on Friday calls for the release by both sides of prisoners and the ""withdrawal of armed groups from the Bab al-Hawa"" border crossing with Turkey.
Bab al-Hawa, which had been controlled by Ahrar al-Sham, would be handed over to civilian administration, it said.
Abdel Rahman said the presence of Ahrar al-Sham rebels had been greatly diminished in Idlib province, which they once dominated. Rebels were left only in Ariha town and part of Jabal al-Zawiya in the southeast.
Ahrar al-Sham has also been hit by the defection of hundreds of its fighters to HTS.
Syria's conflict erupted in mid-March 2011 with peaceful anti-government protests that were brutally repressed by the government.
It quickly evolved into a war involving local, regional and international players on a multitude of fronts, which has killed more than 330,00 people and displaced millions from their homes.

By misidentifying the children and classifying them as adults, Greek authorities have left the children vulnerable to abuse, sexual exploitation and human trafficking, and unable to access the specific services they require, HRW said in a report published on Thursday.
Unaccompanied children often live in formal and impromptu camps where they endure poor sanitary conditions, a lack of basic resources and overcrowding and cannot attend school, the report added.
""The misidentification of unaccompanied migrant kids on Lesbos as adults leads to real problems, including lumping them together with unrelated adults and denying them the care they need,"" Eva Cosse, Greece researcher at HRW, said in the report.
""Greek authorities need to take responsibility for properly identifying unaccompanied children and providing them the protection and care every child needs.""
While some children falsely claim to be adults because they fear being detained, Greek authorities arbitrarily register many children as adults, the report claimed.
OPINION: Who is really responsible for deadly refugee journeys?
Many of the unaccompanied children have fled war-torn countries like Iraq and Syria, while others have escaped poverty and conflict in places like Pakistan.
Hassan, a 16-year-old who spoke to HRW using a pseudonym, said authorities registered him as 19 without conducting standard examinations to determine age. ""I don't know why they changed my age. I asked them many times and the only thing they told me is to sign some papers,"" he said in the report.
Due to Greece's shortage of spaces at shelters designated for unaccompanied children, more than 1,100 people were on a waiting list for accommodation as of June 20.
The Greek Ministry of Migration failed to reply to Al Jazeera's multiple requests for comment.
More than 60,000 refugees and migrants are bottlenecked in Greece due to closed borders across the Balkans.
Macedonia, Serbia, Croatia and others sealed their frontiers after the European Union and Turkey reached a deal to stem the flow of refugees in March 2016.
Of the total number of refugees and migrants in Greece, more than 10,000 are confined to a handful of Aegean islands. They are barred from travelling to mainland Greece until their asylum applications have been fully processed.

With worsening humanitarian conditions in camps and asylum applications moving at a snail's pace, anger has boiled over into clashes on several occasions.
Speaking to the Chinese Xinhua agency last month, Greek Migration Minister Yannis Mouzalas insisted that his country has handled the refugee crisis with ""dignity"" and acknowledged challenges ahead.
""The initial difficulty is that we do not know how many people will eventually stay in Greece,"" he said in the interview.
""The second difficulty is that these people who will eventually stay in Greece did not start their journey to end up in Greece and they are forced to stay. This makes their integration more difficult.""
On Tuesday, asylum seekers in the Moria camp, which is located on Lesbos Island, lit fires and clashed with police officers amid growing tensions. More than 30 people were detained.
More than 102,000 refugees and migrants have crossed the Mediterranean Sea and arrived in Europe so far this year, according to the United Nations refugee agency, UNHCR.
During the first four months of 2017, around 16 percent of the 1,146 children who reached Greek shores were unaccompanied or separated from their families.

Defend Europe, the group behind the journey which began Sunday, said on its fundraising page that its members would set sail in a 422-tonne vessel with a 25-member crew after receiving more than $115,000 in donations in recent weeks.
The crew is expected to arrive in Catania, Italy, on Monday to await the arrival of the boat they will use on their mission, organisers said.
The UK-based organisation, HOPE not hate, which has monitored Defend Europe, reported that the boat was setting sail from Djibouti.
Defend Europe is a far-right organisation and comprises members of the Identitarian Movement, a pan-European conglomerate of activists who rally against Muslims and refugees.
The movement can be traced back to France in 2002 when the far-right Bloc Identitaire party established a youth wing.
HOPE not hate said in a statement that Defend Europe threatens to ""hinder the lifesaving work of search-and-rescue NGO ships in the Mediterranean"".
""This confrontational and dangerous project is organised by far-right activists with a long track record of anti-Muslim and anti-immigrant activism ... and while organised by Europeans, it is being supported, funded and promoted by the extreme far-right around the world,"" HOPE not hate said in a separate press briefing.
Defend Europe says it will reach the refugees and migrants before NGO-operated rescue boats and return them to the Libyan coastguard to stop the ""deadly illegal migration to Europe"".
""This massive illegal migration is changing the face of our continent,"" Defend Europe wrote on its fundraising page.

""We are losing our safety and our way of life and there is a danger that we Europeans will become a minority in our own European homelands.""
In May, Defend Europe activists set sail on a dinghy and unsuccessfully attempted to block a rescue boat manned by Doctors Without Borders (known by its French acronym, MSF).
Lauren Southern, a far-right Canadian activist and media personality, filmed and published online footage of the operation.
During the first four months of 2017, more than one-third of rescue operations in the Mediterranean were carried out by NGOs and private rescue teams.
In a statement provided to Al Jazeera, the Save the Children charity said Defend Europe's plans to disrupt search-and-rescue missions ""are deeply concerning"" and ""ignore the moral and legal obligation"" to save lives in the Mediterranean.
""Without NGOs and other search-and-rescue actors, many more lives, like the men, women and children we have rescued, would be lost,"" the group said, adding that more than 5,000 people drowned en route to Europe last year.
""These activists wish to disrupt efforts to bring these people to safety.""
More than 85,000 refugees and migrants have come to Italy so far this year, according to data released by the interior ministry last week.
Defend Europe's move comes just two days after Italy introduced a controversial code of conduct for NGOs working in the Mediterranean.
Among the new rules is a ban on making phone calls or firing flares, which the Italian government claims could signal to human traffickers when it is safe to send a boat to sea.
Arguing that the new code of conduct will severely restrict the ability of humanitarian and aid groups to carry out their work, Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch condemned the measures in a joint statement.

""Perversely, the proposed code of conduct for NGOs saving lives in the Mediterranean could put lives at risk,"" said Iverna McGowan, director of the Amnesty International's European Institutions Office, in the statement.
""Attempts to restrict NGO search and rescue operations risk endangering thousands of lives by limiting rescue boats from accessing the perilous waters near Libya.""
More than 2,000 refugees and migrants have died in the central Mediterranean since January 2017 according to the International Organisation for Migration's statistics.

The decision on Monday by the foreign ministers of the 28 EU states is the latest step to stem the flow of people from Libya to Italy, now the main escape route to the bloc.
""We took a decision to introduce restrictions from today onwards on the export and supply to Libya of the inflatable boats and motors,"" EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini said.
READ MORE: Defend Europe boat tries to block migrant rescues
""These devices are used by traffickers for smuggling activities. This decision we have taken on the European Union level will help make their businesses and lives even more complicated,"" the former Italian foreign minister told reporters.
An EU statement said there will now be a legal basis to block the supply of dinghies and outboard motors to Libya if there are ""reasonable grounds"" to suspect they will be used by people smugglers and human traffickers.
The restrictions will also apply to such goods if they are transiting through the EU to Libya - a move which would, in theory, affect China where many are manufactured.
Fishermen and others who have legitimate reasons to use the dinghies and motors will still be able to import them, the council said.
In practice, EU countries could deny licenses to import-export businesses suspected of supplying smugglers, according to EU sources.
The new rule does not cover Libya's neighbouring countries, which remain a source of dinghies and outboard motors for smugglers.
As of May 2017, there have been 1,530 people who drowned while crossing the Mediterranean and most of them were reportedly trying to cross to Italy, according to the International Organization for Migration (IOM).
The foreign ministers meanwhile extended until the end of 2018 an EU mission to help Libya re-establish effective controls mainly at its southern borders where sub-Saharan African refugees and migrants first arrive.
Libya is struggling to control its long land borders with Sudan, Chad and Niger.
In another bid to stop smuggling, the EU has also trained 113 Libyan coastguard members in the last few months and plans to train another 75 starting in September, Mogherini told reporters.
The EU is facing growing pressure from Italy to stop the flow of people to its shores, including demands to make member states admit tens of thousands of refugees and migrants under a largely unenforced emergency plan launched nearly two years ago.
More than 100,000 refugees and migrants have crossed the Mediterranean Sea since the start of the year, and 84 percent have arrived in Italy from Libya by boat, according to the IOM.

US District Judge Derrick Watson on Thursday ordered the government not to enforce the ban on grandparents, grandchildren, brothers-in-law, sisters-in-law, aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews and cousins of people in the United States.
""Common sense, for instance, dictates that close family members be defined to include grandparents,"" US District Judge Derrick Watson said in his ruling.
""Indeed grandparents are the epitome of close family members.""
READ MORE: Trump's Muslim ban comes into effect
Watson in Honolulu had been asked to narrowly interpret a US Supreme Court ruling that revived parts of Trump's March 6 executive order banning people from those countries for 90 days.
The US Supreme Court last month let the ban on travel from the six countries go forward with a limited scope, saying it could not apply to anyone with a credible ""bona fide relationship"" with a US person or entity.
The Trump administration then decided that spouses, parents, children, fiances and siblings would be exempt from the ban, while grandparents and other family members travelling from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen would be barred.
The Trump administration also said that all refugees without a close family tie would be blocked from the country for four months.
Trump said the measure was necessary to prevent attacks. However, opponents including states and refugee advocacy groups, sued to stop it, disputing its security rationale and saying it discriminated against Muslims.
Hawaii's attorney general Douglas Chin asked Watson to issue an injunction allowing grandparents and other family members to travel to the United States.
Hawaii and refugee groups argue that resettlement agencies have a ""bona fide"" relationship with the refugees they help, sometimes over the course of years.
The Justice Department said its rules were properly grounded in immigration law.
OPINION: The Muslim ban - Did Trump really win?
In his ruling, Watson said the government had an ""unduly restrictive reading"" of what constituted a close family relationship.
Chin, who represents the state as the plaintiff in the case said the court made clear ""that the U.S. government may not ignore the scope of the partial travel ban as it sees fit.""
""Family members have been separated and real people have suffered enough,"" Chin said in a statement.
Watson said the assurance by a resettlement agency to provide basic services to a newly arrived refugee constitutes an adequate connection to the US because it is a sufficiently formal and documented agreement that triggers responsibilities and compensation.
""'Bona fide' does not get any more 'bona fide' than that,"" Watson said.
Melanie Nezer, vice president of global refugee advocacy group HIAS, said the ruling should mean that refugees can continue to be resettled in the United States, beyond a cap of 50,000 set by the executive order. That limit was reached this week.
""We are thrilled that thousands of people will be reunited with their family members,"" said Becca Heller, director of the International Refugee Assistance Project.More than 24,000 additional refugees should be allowed to travel to the U.S. under Watson's order, she estimated.
The roll-out of the narrowed version of the ban was more subdued than in January, when Trump first signed a more expansive version of the order.
That sparked protests and chaos at airports around the country and the world.

Israeli police said the three gunmen reached one of the gates near the al-Aqsa compound, opened fire and fled towards al-Aqsa Mosque where they were shot dead by police officers on Friday.
Israeli police later ordered the closure of the compound, saying there would be no prayers at the site on Friday.
Al Jazeera's Harry Fawcett, reporting from Jerusalem, said the Palestinians reportedly shot at Israeli security forces near the Lion's Gate to the Old City.
""The three attackers were armed with two machine guns, a pistol and a knife, according to Israeli police,"" Fawcett reported.
""They were then pursued inside the al-Aqsa Mosque compound. In the courtyard of the compound, a final gun battle ensued between the gunmen and Israeli security forces.
""Management of al-Aqsa mosque said the bodies of two Palestinians were inside the courtyard of the compound,"" Fawcett reported.
Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas spoke to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu by phone on Friday and condemned the shooting, Palestinian news agency Wafa said.
""The president expressed his strong rejection and condemnation of the incident that took place at al-Aqsa mosque, as well as his rejection of any violent incidents from any side, especially in places of worship,"" Wafa said.
Abbas called on Netanyahu to end the shutdown of the holy site. Netanyahu assured Abbas the long-standing status quo at the compound, which gives Muslims exclusive prayer rights, would be maintained, Wafa said.
The ancient, marble-and-stone compound houses the al-Aqsa Mosque, Islam's third-holiest site, and the 7th-century Dome of the Rock. Thousands pray there every Friday.
The western wall of the compound, also known as the Wailing Wall, is considered the holiest site in Judaism.
""It is the first time in years that the compound closes for prayers on Friday. Of course, this has the potential to increase tensions among the about 10,000 Palestinians who normally come here for worship,"" Fawcett said.
Following the incident, access to the Old City was restricted.
Dozens of Palestinian residents waited in the sun to be allowed into the Old City.
Um Nidal, who lives in Bab Huta - a neighbourhood in the Muslim quarter - told Al Jazeera that she has been waiting for more than three hours with her child, who is 16 months old.
""I've been waiting here since 11:30am, the police will not let me in and I was pushed away,"" she said.
Adham Asfour, 30, also said he was unable to return home.
""We have no choice but to wait here until they let us through,"" he told Al Jazeera.
With the mosque closed, hundreds of Palestinians instead held prayers near Damascus Gate.
Police arrested Muhammed Ahmad Hussein, the grand mufti of Jerusalem and city's highest Islamic authority, after he led prayers, said Azzam el Khatib, director of the religious organisation Al Awqaf.
Hussein had earlier decried the mosque closure.
""Forbidding the Friday prayer is an unfair procedure,"" Sheikh Omar Keswani, a religious official at al-Aqsa, told Al Jazeera.
""What happened earlier is now being taken advantage of by the Israeli right to impose a new reality in al-Aqsa Mosque,"" Keswani added.
Haj Khalil Abu Elsheikh, 77, travelled 100km from Beersheba to attend Friday prayers at Al-Aqsa Mosque.
""No religion allows this,"" he told Al Jazeera, referring to praying on the side of the road. ""No belief accepts this.""
In a separate incident on Friday, Israeli forces shot dead an 18-year-old Palestinian during a raid in Dheisheh refugee camp south of Bethlehem in the occupied West Bank.
Israeli forces arrested two Palestinians during the raid, sources told Al Jazeera.
Since September 2015, Israeli forces have killed more than 254 Palestinians, Israel claims most of them were attackers.
In that same period, Palestinian attackers have killed 43 Israelis, two visiting Americans and a British tourist.

Sa'ad Salah, 21, was shot in the head and killed on the spot, according to a source in a Jenin hospital, while 17-year-old Aws Salameh succumbed to his wounds at the hospital early on Wednesday.
They were the 38th and 39th Palestinians to be killed by Israeli forces this year.
Salah's uncle told local media that the Israeli army ""executed him in cold blood"".
Mujahid al-Saadi, a journalist and resident of Jenin refugee camp, said that after shooting Salah in the head, Israeli soldiers then fired ten bullets in his chest.
""The army was in the city of Jenin arresting a number of Palestinians - most of whom were former prisoners - before they raided the camp,"" al-Saadi said.
No arrests were made in the camp, he added. A third Palestinian was shot in the leg and is in moderate condition.

The Israeli army said soldiers shot at ""attackers"" after ""Palestinian gunmen opened fire at the forces and assailants hurled explosive devices at the forces"" who entered the camp.
None of their forces were wounded in the incident, the army added. Stun grenades and tear gas were also fired at Palestinians in the camp.
Twenty-one Palestinians across the West Bank were arrested by the Israeli army during early-morning raids, mostly for rock-throwing and taking part in protests. A wave of unrest that broke out in October 2015 has claimed the lives of 277 Palestinians, 42 Israelis, two Americans, two Jordanians, an Eritrean, a Sudanese and a Briton, according to an AFP news agency toll. Israeli authorities say most of the Palestinians killed were carrying out knife, gun or car-ramming attacks. Others were shot dead in protests and clashes, while some were killed in Israeli air strikes on the Gaza Strip.

The Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) reported on Monday that ongoing fighting in the CAR has also left more than 100 people dead since April.
In the eastern province of Haute-Kotto, clashes between armed groups since June have forced almost the entire population of its regional capital Bria to flee for their lives.

The humanitarian group estimates that nine in 10 of the important mining town's 47,000 population have fled their homes because of the latest violence.
""We are worried about the situation in the city, and we call the humanitarian community to support the organisations already in the area to assist us,"" Fatimatou Sai, a refugee, was quoted as telling the NRC.
A peace deal signed by 13 of the country’s 14 armed groups in June brought hope of peace to the war-ravaged country. But hopes faded when more than 50 people were killed in fighting that broke out the same day.
""Those 43,000 displaced persons have lived in dire conditions since the beginning of this crisis. Lack of access to health services, drinking water, and adequate shelters are some of the issues that worsened with the conflict,"" said NRC staff member Severin Modowanza.
People have fled to seven locations across the eastern region, including two churches and a hospital, NRC said.
The group said it was working to provide legal aid for those who have fled their homes, while extending humanitarian assistance such as food, water and shelter to the displaced people.
The country, one of the poorest in the world, has been plagued by inter-religious and inter-communal conflict since 2013 between the mainly Muslim Seleka rebels and the Christian Anti-Balaka militia that started after the overthrow of leader Francois Bozize.
In May this year, the UN's refugee agency said that there were more than 500,000 internally displaced persons in the entire country.
CAR has enjoyed little stability since gaining its independence from France in 1960.

""I announce from here the end and the failure and the collapse of the terrorist state of falsehood and terrorism which the terrorist Daesh announced from Mosul,"" Abadi said on Monday evening, using an Arabic acronym for Islamic State.
Abadi, wearing a black military uniform and flanked by commanders from the security forces, thanked troops and the US-led coalition that backed the offensive. But he warned that more challenges lay ahead.
""We have another mission ahead of us, to create stability, to build and clear Daesh cells, and that requires an intelligence and security effort, and the unity which enabled us to fight Daesh,"" he said before raising an Iraqi flag.
A 100,000-strong coalition of Iraqi government units, Kurdish Peshmerga fighters and Shia armed groups launched the offensive to recapture the city from the militants in October, with key air and ground support from an international coalition.
The commander of the US-led coalition said Iraqi troops have firm control of the city, but some areas still must be cleared of explosive devices and possible ISIL fighters.
""This victory alone does not eliminate [ISIL] and there is still a tough fight ahead. But the loss of one of its twin capitals and a jewel of their so-called caliphate is a decisive blow,"" Lieutenant-General Stephen Townsend said in a statement.
There were huge celebrations in cities across Iraq on Monday evening after Abadi's declaration of victory.
People gathered in the capital Baghdad's Tahrir Square and in Basra, dancing and waving flags as others took to the streets in convoys of motorcycles and cars.
Ali Mohsen, a Baghdad resident, praised Iraqi troops and said: ""We hope to uproot Daesh so the displaced can return to their homes.""
A spokesman for UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said on Monday the recovery of Mosul was ""a significant step in the fight against terrorism and violent extremism"".
It was in Mosul three years ago that ISIL leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi declared the caliphate and himself the leader of the world's Muslims.
The cost of the nearly nine-month battle to retake the city has been enormous: much of Mosul in ruins, thousands dead and wounded and nearly a million people forced from their homes.
OPINION: What's next after Mosul?
Civilians who have fled fighting in Mosul face a dire humanitarian crisis. The Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) say displaced civilians are living in ""incredible hardship"" in temporary camps.
""Temperatures in this part of Iraq are topping 45 degrees. People are living in camps. They need a lot of water, and the threat of disease looms in this kind of weather,"" the NRC's Melany Markham told Al Jazeera from Erbil.
The UN says 920,000 civilians have fled their homes since the military campaign began in October. Close to 700,000 people are still displaced.
The UN refugee agency said on Monday it could be many months before civilians are able to return to their homes because of ""extensive damage caused during the conflict"".
""It's a relief to know that the military campaign in Mosul is ending. The fighting may be over, but the humanitarian crisis is not,"" Lise Grande, the UN's humanitarian coordinator in Iraq, said in a statement.
""Many of the people who have fled have lost everything. They need shelter, food, healthcare, water, sanitation and emergency kits. The levels of trauma we are seeing are some of the highest anywhere. What people have experienced is nearly unimaginable.""
While defeat in Iraq's second-largest city deals a heavy blow to ISIL, the group controls several cities and towns south and west of Mosul.
ISIL is also under heavy pressure in its operational headquarters in the Syrian city of Raqqa and its self-proclaimed caliphate that once straddled the two countries is crumbling.

The US Supreme Court last month let the ban on travel from six Muslim countries go forward with a limited scope, saying it could not apply to anyone with a credible ""bona fide relationship"" with a US person or entity.
A Honolulu judge this week rejected Hawaii's request to clarify the Supreme Court ruling and narrow the government's implementation of the ban.
Hawaii appealed to the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals, saying in a filing that the appeals court has the power to narrow the travel ban while it decides how to interpret the Supreme Court's ruling.
On Friday, a three-judge 9th Circuit panel, however, rejected that argument and said it did not have jurisdiction to hear Hawaii's appeal.
Justice department lawyers have argued that its definition of close family ""hews closely"" to language found in US immigration law, while Hawaii's attorney general's office said other parts of immigration law include grandparents in that group.
Shortly after the Supreme Court issued its opinion last month, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) said on Twitter it would ""head back into court to fight the fundamentally unconstitutional Muslim ban this October"".
Omar Jadwat, the director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project who had argued the case in court, said in a statement that the travel ban ""violates the fundamental constitutional principle that government cannot favour or disfavour any one religion"".
""Courts have repeatedly blocked this indefensible and discriminatory ban. The Supreme Court now has a chance to permanently strike it down,"" he said.
Lara Finkbeiner, from the International Refugee Assistance Project, which also sued the administration over the ban, said she was ""incredibly disappointed with the decision"".
""We are a nation that values acceptance and diversity, and in making this decision and putting this executive order back into effect, the Supreme Court is sending a very clear message and it's putting the executive's discriminatory policy back into effect.""

World Food Programme, UNICEF, World Health Organization, UN refugee agency (UNHCR) and Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) will be the main beneficiaries of the funds, according to the deals signed on Saturday in Qatar's capital Doha.
Al Jazeera's Imran Khan, reporting from Doha, said the initiative born when Qatar cancelled celebrations of its National Day in December 2016 in solidarity with the Syrian city of Aleppo which was under assault at the time.
""That really captured the imagination of some of the leaders of the Qatari charities who decided they were going to help the UN within Syria,"" he said.
But some of these charities are themselves under attack, he added.
On June 8, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt issued a joint press release in which they designated 59 individuals and 12 organisations of differing nationalities, including Qatar Charity and Eid Charity, as ""terrorist"".

The UN responded to this statement by reiterating that they are bound only by the ""terrorist designations"" issued by its own agencies, not those issued by any other party.
Stephane Dujarric, spokesperson for the secretary-general of the UN, said that the UN has strong cooperation with Qatar Charity, including a number of joint projects being implemented in Yemen, Syria and Iraq.
An official at the Qatari Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that accusing Qatar's charities of ""terrorism"" is not only a defamation of humanitarian charitable work, but also constituted a violation of international standards and rules.
He pointed out that the inclusion of a number of journalists on the list indicated that the purpose was to intimidate and to muzzle freedom of expression guaranteed by international accords.
Saudi Arabia and its allies cut ties with Qatar on June 5 and imposed land, sea, air blockade on the country, accusing it of funding ""terrorism"" - an allegation Doha denies.
Later, they issued a 13-point list of demands that was rejected by Doha.

US District Judge Derrick Watson in Honolulu had been asked to interpret a ruling from the Supreme Court that revived parts of Trump's March 6 executive order banning people from six Muslim-majority countries for 90 days.
The highest court let the ban go forward with a limited scope, saying it could not apply to anyone with a credible ""bona fide relationship"" with a US person or entity.
Trump said the measure was necessary to prevent extremist attacks. However, opponents including states and refugee advocacy groups sued to stop it, disputing its security rationale and saying it discriminated against Muslims.

Watson said in Thursday's ruling he ""declines to usurp the prerogative of the Supreme Court to interpret its own order"".
Hawaii said late on Thursday it would appeal against Watson's ruling to the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco, according to a court filing.
The Justice Department said in a statement it was pleased with the ruling.
""We are confident that the US Supreme Court will again vindicate the president and his constitutional duty to protect the national security of the United States,"" it said.
The government said after last month's Supreme Court ruling that a ""bona fide relationship"" meant close family members only, such as parents, spouses, fiancés, siblings and children.
Grandparents, grandchildren, aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews and cousins from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen would still be banned.
The state of Hawaii asked Watson last week to clarify the Supreme Court's ruling, arguing the government's definition of ""bona fide relationship"" was too narrow.
OPINION: The Muslim ban - Did Trump really win?
Justice Department lawyers said its definition ""hews closely"" to language found in US immigration law, while Hawaii's attorney general's office said other parts of immigration law included grandparents as close family.
The government reversed its position on fiancés before the ban went into effect last week, saying they could also qualify for exceptions.
The rollout of the narrowed version of the ban was more subdued last week than in January, when Trump first signed a more expansive version of the order.
That sparked protests and chaos at airports around the country and the world.

The blaze, which destroyed about 100 tents, also left at least six people injured according to the Red Cross. Emergency workers said the fire had turned the tent camp into ""ashes"", with only the bathrooms at the edge of the settlement left standing.
Al Jazeera's Imtiaz Tyab, reporting from the scene, described scenes of ""utter devastation"".

""This is really quite shocking for refugees,"" he said. ""These are people who fled war and conflict, people who left behind their homes, and the homes they built here from bits of wood and sheets of plastic have been reduced to ashes.""
""First responders told us they believe this fire was started by some sort of cooking accident,"" Tyab continued.
""They believe one of the residents of this camp had been cooking food inside their home and that it had somehow caught fire.""
The fire spread rapidly and all that is left is smouldering ruins, he added.
""These Syrian refugees, who already fled their homes from the fighting, had very little to begin with - but now they have nothing.""
Large plumes of black smoke can be seen above Bekaa. Hundreds of thousands of Syrian refugees live in informal tented settlements there
Dana Sleiman, spokesperson for the United Nations' refugee agency, UNHCR, said the fire had affected 102 families living in the camp, which was one of the approximately 3,000 informal settlements in the country.
""It's a very tragic situation,"" she told Al Jazeera from Beirut. ""Unfortunately tented settlements of this sort - because of their informality and spontaneity as they are built in very ad hoc ways - are at high risk of fire during the summertime especially.""
Sleiman said aid agencies were on site to help the families and assess the situation to gauge the damage.
""The Lebanese Red Cross has already provided a secure shelter for these families to spend the night tonight, and our teams have negotiated another piece of land for them to relocate and we will provide them with the tools they need to set up their tents again.""
OPINION: Xenophobia will not solve Lebanon's refugee crisis
Lebanon is hosting at least one million Syrian refugees officially registered with the UN, many of them living in informal tented settlements scattered around the country.
But the government says the number of Syrian refugees in Lebanon is closer to 1.5 million.
""The fact is that in Lebanon there are no formal camps, so refugees are spread ... pretty much across the country,"" Sleiman said.
She added that since there has been no governmental decision to build formal camps, many refugees are trying to do the best they can and find the cheapest accommodation possible.
""One solution has been to expand what formerly used to be tented settlements for seasonal workers here in the country. So these have expanded in size and in number and have spread more across the whole country, especially in the Bekaa area, which this fire happened, and also in the north,"" Sleiman said.

The gunmen late on Sunday attacked a village in Kablewa town near the southeastern Niger city of Diffa, close to the border with Nigeria, authorities said on Monday.
They killed eight young people and an elderly man, Kablewa Mayor Abari Elh Daouda told the DPA news agency by telephone.
READ MORE: Boko Haram refugees in Niger find safety, but lack aid
In a separate interview with the AFP news agency, Daouda said between 30 to 40 people, including women and young men, were also abducted.
He said Niger authorities were headed to the area to investigate.
Abba Gata Issa, another mayor from the Diffa area, confirmed to Reuters that nine people had died, and around 40 women and children had been kidnapped.
The attackers rode camels into the village and carried out the killings, according to Maman Nour, the director of a community radio station in Kablewa.
The attack was the second such incident in the village in a week.
There are more than 300,000 refugees and displaced people sheltered in the Diffa area, but authorities said they were planning to transfer thousands of refugees and displaced people to camps further from the border with Nigeria, where Boko Haram operates.
Al Jazeera's Ahmed Idris, reporting from the Nigerian capital, Abuja, said no group has claimed responsibility for the latest attack.
""For incidents like this, it takes Boko Haram days to come up with a statement,"" he said. ""But over the last two months in particular, we've seen heightened activities on the part of the Boko Haram, who have stepped up their suicide bombings, especially on the Nigerian side.
""This is an escalation at a time when security services are saying that they have gotten a grip of the situation,"" our correspondent said.
Since 2015, the armed group's members have been staging regular attacks in the Diffa region, where Niger has declared a state of emergency.
On Wednesday, two female bombers blew themselves up in a refugee camp in the town, killing two other people and wounding 11, in an attack also blamed on Boko Haram.
More than 20,000 people have been killed and more than two million have fled their homes since Boko Haram launched an armed campaign in 2009 to create an Islamic state in northeast Nigeria.

The move comes as interior ministers of France, Germany and Italy prepare to meet in Paris on Sunday to discuss a ""coordinated approach"" to help Rome.
Italy needs more international support to cope with a growing number of people who have braved a perilous Mediterranean crossing to reach Europe this year, Filippo Grandi, the UN high commissioner for refugees, said on Saturday in a statement.
""What is happening in front of our eyes in Italy is an unfolding tragedy.
""In the course of last weekend, 12,600 migrants and refugees arrived on its shores, and an estimated 2,030 have lost their lives in the Mediterranean since the beginning of the year.""
Italy, he said, was ""playing its part"" in taking in those rescued and offering protection to those in need.
""These efforts must be continued and strengthened. But this cannot be an Italian problem alone.""
Last week, Italy threatened to close its doors to people arriving on boats that were not flying Italian flags.
Europe has to get fully involved through an ""urgent distribution system"" of migrants and refugees and should widen legal channels so that migrants can be admitted, Grandi said.
He also called for greater international efforts to tackle the causes of migration, to protect people and to fight trafficking.

Since the beginning of the year, 83,650 people have reached Italy by sea, an increase of nearly 20 percent compared with the same period last year, UN figures show.
Nearly all of Italy's 200,000 places for accommodating migrants have been filled.
Many of the people arriving need healthcare and support. A large percentage of them are non-accompanied children and victims of sexual violence, says the UN.
The number of migrant children arriving on their own rose twofold between 2015 and 2016, reaching 25,846 at the end of last year.
Europe has been grappling with the worst migration crisis since the end of World War II with an influx of people fleeing the wars in Syria and Iraq while others from Africa are seeking an escape from poverty or political persecution.
And there continue to be flare-ups of violence prompted by the tensions among the migrants and refugees gathered in western Europe.
In the northern French port city of Calais, riot police stepped in over the past two days to break up fighting among African asylum seekers armed with sticks and rocks.
Fighting between Eritreans and Ethiopians on Saturday left 16 people injured, with police making 10 arrests.
That followed brawls on Friday night when security forces used tear gas to disperse the feuding sides, Calais Mayor Philippe Mignonet said.
""In the past 12 hours, in terms of violence, there's been an escalation,"" he told AFP.
Calais has for years been a magnet for migrants and refugees hoping to cross the Channel to Britain.
Last October, France broke up the notorious tent camp known as ""the Jungle"" transferring thousands of migrants to centres around the country.
But hundreds remain near the port, mostly Africans and Afghans, who clash sporadically with police as they make nightly attempts to stow away onto trucks heading across the Channel to Britain.
Last month, a Polish driver was killed when his truck burst into flames after hitting a roadblock set up by migrants hoping to slow the traffic to make it easier to jump onto vehicles.
French President Emmanuel Macron's new government has ruled out building a reception centre for asylum seekers in Calais, saying it would only encourage more people to come, and has promised to reinforce security.

The agency said it had seen ""a notable trend of spontaneous returns to and within Syria in 2017"".
Since January, about 440,000 people who had been displaced within the war-ravaged country had returned to their homes, mainly in Aleppo, Hama, Homs and Damascus, Andrej Mahecic, a spokesman for the agency, known as the UNHCR, told reporters in Geneva on Friday.
In addition, around 31,000 refugees in neighbouring countries had also returned, he said, bringing to 260,000 the number of refugees who have returned to the country since 2015.
READ MORE: Syria's 'de-escalation zones' explained
But Mahecic said this is a mere ""fraction"" of the five million Syrian refugees hosted in the region.
He said the main factors prompting the displaced to return home were ""seeking out family members, checking on property, and, in some cases, a real or perceived improvement in security conditions in parts of the country.""
He said it was too early to say if the returns might be directly linked to a palpable drop in violence since Turkey agreed at talks in Astana in May with Russia and Iran, allies of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, to establish four safe zones across Syria to ban flights and ensure aid drops.
But this week, the UN's special envoy for Syria, Staffan de Mistura, told the Security Council that since the May 4 deal, ""violence is clearly down. Hundreds of Syrian lives continue to be spared every week, and many towns have returned to some degree of normalcy.""
READ MORE: Russia - Syrian safe zones plan comes into effect
Mahecic nonetheless cautioned that ""while there is overall increased hope linked to the recent Astana and Geneva peace talks, UNHCR believes conditions for refugees to return in safety and dignity are not yet in place in Syria.""
""The sustainability of security improvements in many return areas is uncertain, and there remain significant risks of protection thresholds for voluntary, safe and dignified returns not being met in parts of the country,"" he said.
""Access to displaced population inside Syria remains a key challenge,"" he added.
But ""given the returns witnessed so far this year and in light of a progressively increased number of returns"", the agency had begun scaling up its operations inside Syria to better be able to address the needs of the returnees, he said.
Syria's war has killed more than 320,000 people and forced millions from their homes since it began in March 2011.

""Five suicide bombings and a grenade attack targeted the Lebanese Army early Friday in the northeastern border town of Arsal, leaving seven soldiers wounded,"" the army said in a statement.
Four of the suicide bombers struck in the al-Nour camp near the border town of Arsal, the army said.
A young girl, whose parents are both refugees, was killed and three soldiers wounded, the army said.
A medical source in the provincial capital Baalbek told AFP news agency the girl was two and a half years old.
Troops recovered four explosive devices during the raid.
""The army immediately detonated these devices in the places they were planted,"" the statement said.
Another attacker blew himself up in the nearby camp of al-Qariyeh, and a second attacker threw a grenade at troops, wounding four of them.
The army said its units were continuing with the raids, which are aimed at ""arresting terrorists and seizing weapons"".
Witnesses reported hearing intermittent bursts of gunfire in the area.
The wounded soldiers were airlifted to hospital by a Lebanese army helicopter, Tayyar media reported.
There have been multiple clashes along the border between the Lebanese army and hardline fighters connected to the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL, also known as ISIS) or Al-Qaeda.

In August 2014, the army clashed with ISIL and al-Qaeda's then Syria affiliate Jabhat Al-Nusra in the Arsal area, with hardline fighters kidnapping 30 Lebanese soldiers and policemen as they withdrew back along the border.
After long and arduous negotiations, 16 of the kidnapped men were released in December 2015 in exchange for Islamist prisoners held in Lebanese jail.
The hardline fighters executed four of their hostages while a fifth died of wounds he suffered in the initial Arsal clashes, leaving nine members of Lebanon's security forces still in their hands.
About 1,500 fighters are still believed to be operating near the flashpoint town of Arsal, which was overrun by ISIL in 2014.
Across the border, advances by the Syrian army, backed by the Lebanese Hezbollah movement, last year cut off the rebels from the east, leaving them surrounded in an area straddling the border.
About 70,000 Syrian refugees live in camps in and around Arsal, some of the more than one million Syrians who have fled to Lebanon to escape a bloody civil war on the other side of the border.

It was supposed to be a happy occasion but Issa, who has been living in the United States since 2011, had to postpone the event after the Supreme Court reinstated parts of President Donald Trump's ban on travellers from six Muslim-majority countries earlier this week.
That meant some of Issa's family members due to join her from abroad would not be able to do so.
""It's so stressful to be a bride and organise your wedding and then find out you can't even invite your family,"" Issa told Al Jazeera outside New York's JFK International Airport Terminal 4, where flights from several Middle Eastern countries operate from.
""I don't want the government to tell me who is supposed to be part of my family and who is not.""
Issa was at the airport to assist other travellers who get mixed up in Trump's temporary ban against travellers from Syria, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen.
Her case highlights a problem raised by the Supreme Court's ruling which allowed Trump's executive order to take effect but narrowed its scope, exempting travellers and refugees with a ""bona fide relationship"" with a person or entity in the US.
On Wednesday, the State Department said visa applicants from the six nations must have a close US family relationship or formal ties to an American entity in order to be admitted to the country.
State Department guidance on the ban defined a close relationship as being a parent, spouse, child, adult son or daughter, son-in-law, daughter-in-law or sibling, including step-siblings, and other step-family relations.
""Grandparents, grandchildren, aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews, cousins, brothers-in-law and sisters-in-law, fiances, and any other 'extended' family members"" are not considered close family, according to the cable.
For Issa, this means her father in Syria's capital, Damascus, can apply for a visa but her aunts and uncles, who endure the same daily hardships in Syria's long-running civil war, are not able to.
A close cousin, who was tortured by the Syrian government's security forces and is now a refugee in Austria, would not be able to celebrate her big day in the US, according to Issa. Neither would another cousin in Lebanon.
The court allowed the ban to go into effect until it can take up the case during its next term starting in October.
OPINION: The Muslim ban: Did Trump really win?
""This administration is redefining what family is,"" said Issa, whose mother's side of the family is based in the US.
""It's having a big toll on me psychologically. We're delaying the wedding so that when the Supreme Court comes out with a ruling [later this year], maybe there's some hope to get at least my cousins over for the wedding.""
Trump first announced his temporary travel ban after being sworn in as president in January. He called it a counterterrorism measure to allow time to develop better security vetting.
The order caused major confusion at airports as officials scrambled to enforce it and was blocked by federal courts. A revised version of the ban in March was also halted by the courts.
On Thursday, hours before the narrowed version of Trump's order came into effect at 8pm local time (00:00 GMT Friday), New York's airports were more orderly.
Camille Mackler, a legal boss for the New York Immigration Council, which supports immigrants in the city, told Al Jazeera that only visas being applied for once the ruling became active would be affected.
But, according to Mackler, there remained a threat for some arriving passengers, whose visas were approved before the court's decision, being ""stopped and pulled into secondary inspection"" by over-vigilante US Customs and Border Protection officers.
She was there to ensure ""nobody is being harmed"", said Mackler
""Around a 1,000 lawyers have emailed me since Monday. My inbox is overflowing because lawyers say they're ready to come back out to fight,"" added Mackler, advising those in need to get in touch with the Muslim Immigration Ban Hotline.

Dave Ray, a spokesperson for the Federation for American Immigration Reform, which campaigns for tighter rules on entering the US, praised the court's decision as a victory for Trump and those who fret about national security.
""Clearly, a better vetting system needs to be in place to ensure those wishing to harm innocent Americans are prevented from entering the US,"" Ray said.
The ban stirred anger and confusion in parts of the Middle East, with would-be visitors worried about their travel plans and their future.
On Thursday, Emirates Airlines said its flights to the US were operating normally. Abu Dhabi-based Etihad Airways said it is allowing nationals from the six countries to board US-bound flights if they have valid travel documents.
Amnesty International said it had sent researchers to airports in New York, Washington and Los Angeles to monitor the implementation of the ban and assist anyone who is unfairly stopped from entering the US.
""The president wanted a complete and total shutdown of Muslims entering this country and, unfortunately, he was able to take one step in that direction,"" Naureen Shah, one of the group's campaigners, said.
For Issa, the damage is already done. Arab Americans in her community of Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, feel ""ostracised"" and ""under attack"". Her wedding, to a Colombian migrant, has been pushed back to 2018 at least.
""We came here with a dream of what America is and we're pretty disappointed with everything that's happening,"" she said.

https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/06/muslim-ban-sets-strict-rules-visa-applicants-170629035105457.html,refugee,1026,Thu Jun 29 2017 06:36:05 GMT+0000,None,Muslim Ban: US sets strict rules for visa applicants,"A leaked state department cable has outlined new criteria for visa applicants from six mainly Muslim countries as partial enforcement of Donald Trump's travel ban is set to come into force on Thursday.
Under the new guidelines, which were leaked to the press and have yet to be confirmed, new visa applicants from Syria, Sudan, Somalia, Libya, Iran and Yemen and all refugees must prove a relationship to a ""close"" relative already in the United States to be eligible for a US visa.
A close relative is defined as a parent, spouse, child, adult son or daughter, son or daughter-in-law or sibling.
The new guidelines excludes categories that had previously been laid out by Monday's Supreme Court decision that partially reinstated Trump's March 6 executive order.
Grandparents, grandchildren, aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews, cousins, brothers-in-law and sisters-in-law, fiancees or other extended family members are not considered to be close relationships, according to the guidelines that were issued in a cable sent to all US embassies and consulates late on Wednesday.
The same requirements, with some exceptions, hold for all refugees that are still awaiting approval for admission to the US.
OPINION: The Muslim ban and the ethnic cleansing of America
As far as business or professional links are concerned, the Department of State said a legitimate relationship must be ""formal, documented and formed in the ordinary course rather than for the purpose of evading"" the ban.
The cable said ""a worker who accepted an offer of employment from a company in the United States or a lecturer invited to address an audience in the United States would be exempt"" from the travel ban, but someone who simply made a hotel reservation would not count as someone with a bona fide relationship, according to Reuters news agency.
Consular officers may grant other exemptions to applicants from the six countries if they have ""previously established significant contacts with the United States"" or ""significant business or professional obligations"" in the US.
Exemptions may also be granted if the applicant is an infant, adopted child, in need of urgent medical care, if they are travelling for business with a recognised international organisation or the US government, or if they are a legal resident of Canada who applies for a visa in Canada, according to the cable.
The new rules take effect at 00:00 GMT on Friday, or 8pm EDT in the US, according to the cable.
OPINION - The Muslim ban: Did Trump really win?
Bruce Fein, a former US associate deputy attorney general, told Al Jazeera if the reports by the Associated Press news agency are true, it ""limits the categories"" previously established by the Supreme Court's opinion on Monday.
Fein said this means the Trump administration would seem to be ""in defiance of at least a minimal scope for the bona fide relationship that required the department to continue grant visas"", which would mean ""respondents in the case could return to court, ask for an immediate emergency hearing and ask for an injunction or a finding that the state department or Trump be held in contempt"".
Fein added that ""there isn't any doubt that the two categories listed ... is narrower than the expressed terms of the court's opinion.""
Unchallenged, the new guidance will remain in place until the Supreme Court issues a final ruling on the matter. Arguments before the justices will not be held until at least October, so the interim rules will remain in place at least until the fall.
Questions over how the new guidelines will be enforced remain.
The state department cable does not give details on what documentation is required to prove applicants fall into one of the accepted categories.
Fein told Al Jazeera that ""in many of these cases, you think the state department thought the medical records kept in Somalia are like the record kept in New York City or Washington, DC"".
He said that the same types of questions remain on how visa applicants should prove they have the needed business ties.
""It's going to be massive confusion and why the state department would issue the cable without having clarifying these issues is mystifying,"" Fein said.
""It's simply going to invite more confusion, more anger and more frustration.""
Shortly after taking office, Trump ordered the refugee ban and a travel ban affecting the six countries, plus Iraq. He said it was needed to protect the US from ""terrorists"", but opponents said it was unfairly harsh and was intended to meet his campaign promise to keep Muslims out of the US.
After a federal judge struck down the bans, Trump signed a revised order intended to overcome legal hurdles.
The revised order excluded visa applicants from Iraq. The new order was also struck down by lower courts, but the Supreme Court's action on Monday partially reinstated it.
READ MORE: Refugee advocacy groups slam 'Muslim Ban' ruling
Shortly after the court issued its opinion, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) said on Twitter it would ""head back into court to fight the fundamentally unconstitutional Muslim ban this October"".
Omar Jadwat, the director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project who had argued the case in court, said in a statement that the travel ban ""violates the fundamental constitutional principle that government cannot favour or disfavour any one religion"".
""Courts have repeatedly blocked this indefensible and discriminatory ban. The Supreme Court now has a chance to permanently strike it down,"" he said.
Lara Finkbeiner, from the International Refugee Assistance Project, which also sued the administration over the ban, said she was ""incredibly disappointed with the decision"".
""We are a nation that values acceptance and diversity, and in making this decision and putting this executive order back into effect, the Supreme Court is sending a very clear message and it's putting the executive's discriminatory policy back into effect.""
But Trump praised the decision, saying in a statement it allowed his travel ban ""to become largely effective"".
""Today's unanimous Supreme Court decision is a clear victory for our national security,"" Trump said on Monday, adding that the ruling allowed him ""to use an important tool for protecting our nation's homeland"".

Information minister Ernesto Villegas said the stolen helicopter first fired 15 shots on the ministry in Caracas, the capital, as a reception was taking place on Tuesday.
It then flew a short distance to the supreme court building and dropped four grenades, two of them near the national guardsmen protecting the building.
Maduro said no one was injured as the grenades failed to detonate during the incident.
The attack occurred as Maduro was speaking live on state television to journalists gathered at the presidential palace.
""I have activated the entire armed forces to defend the peace,"" he said.
READ MORE: Venezuela - A country divided
However, opponents on social media accused the president himself of trying to spread fear to help justify a crackdown against Venezuelans seeking to block his plans to rewrite the constitution.
Maduro has been facing three months of opposition protests and some dissent from within government ranks.
An Associated Press news agency reporter heard gunfire as a helicopter buzzed over downtown Caracas but was unable to confirm where the shots were being fired from.
Around the time of the attack, a video appeared on social media in which a police squad pilot, identified as Oscar Perez, called for a rebellion against the Maduro's ""tyranny"".
""We have two choices; be judged tomorrow by our conscience and the people or begin today to free ourselves from this corrupt government,"" he said.
Perez read his statement with four people dressed in military fatigues, ski masks and carrying assault rifles standing behind him.
Phil Gunson, a senior analyst at the International Crisis Group, told Al Jazeera that this was a ""very strange incident"".
""It seems, on the one hand, to have been an isolated incident, with no response so far from any military units that we can tell,"" said Gunson, speaking from Caracas.
""It could be that this is just a few crazy people trying to set off some kind of coup, or it could indeed be some kind of fake incident that the government is using in order to justify a further crackdown,"" he said.
Al Jazeera's Teresa Bo, reporting from Caracas, said details were still emerging on what was a ""confusing incident"" on a ""very tense night"".
""The government says they have identified the group [responsible] and they say they will detain them as soon as possible,"" she said.
""This is happening at the same time that the supreme court announced that they will allow the government to call martial law in the country after the protests that have happened here for almost three months,"" said Bo.
She said that the supreme court had also announced it was removing the immunity of lawmakers - ""especially of opposition legislators, who the government accuses of promoting the protests that have already caused dozens of deaths,"" said Bo.
Earlier on Tuesday, Maduro warned that he and supporters would take up arms if his socialist government was violently overthrown by opponents who have been on the streets protesting for three months.
""I'm telling the world, and I hope the world listens after 90 days of protest, destruction and death,"" Maduro said in reference to anti-government unrest that has led to at least 75 deaths in the OPEC nation since April.
""If Venezuela was plunged into chaos and violence and the Bolivarian Revolution destroyed, we would go to combat. We would never give up, and what couldn't be done with votes, we would do with weapons, we would liberate the fatherland with weapons.""
Maduro, 54, was speaking at a rally to promote a July 30 vote for a special super-body called a Constituent Assembly, which could rewrite the national charter and supersede other institutions such as the opposition-controlled congress.
He has touted the assembly as the only way to bring peace to Venezuela. But opponents, who want to bring forward the next presidential election scheduled for late 2018, say it is a sham poll designed purely to keep the socialists in power.
They are boycotting the vote and protesting daily on the streets to try and have it stopped.
Opposition leaders call Maduro a dictator who has wrecked a once-prosperous economy, while he calls them violent coup leaders.
Maduro, who accuses Washington of backing his opponents and seeking to control the nation's oil wealth, said the ""destruction"" of Venezuela would lead to a huge refugee wave dwarfing the migrant crisis in the Mediterranean.
READ MORE: Venezuela's crisis explained from the beginning
Opposition to the July 30 vote has come not just from Venezuelan opposition parties, but also from the chief state prosecutor Luisa Ortega and onetime government heavyweights like former intelligence service boss Miguel Rodriguez.
At a news conference on Tuesday, Rodriguez criticised Maduro for not holding a referendum prior to the Constituent Assembly election, as his predecessor Chavez had done in 1999.
""This is a country without government, this is chaos,"" he said.
The country has the world's largest oil reserves but is facing the worst economic crisis in its history, with acute shortages of food and medicine. The International Monetary Fund is forecasting more than 1600 percent inflation this year.
Analyst Phil Gunson told Al Jazeera there have been a number of reports and rumours over the past few weeks of discontent within the armed forces.
""But so far that discontent ... has not translated into a split in the armed forces, and this is clearly what everybody's waiting for,"" said Gunson.
""Because, if President Maduro can retain the support of the armed forces, then he seems to be relatively secure in his position - at least in terms of holding off the opposition demonstrations.""

https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/06/refugee-advocacy-groups-slam-muslim-ban-ruling-170626192518196.html,refugee,839,Tue Jun 27 2017 20:19:19 GMT+0000,Creede Newton,Refugee advocacy groups slam 'Muslim Ban' ruling,"Washington, DC - Refugee advocacy groups have raised concerns after the US Supreme Court partially reinstated the Trump administration's ban on travellers from six predominantly Muslim countries - commonly known as the ""Muslim ban"" - and all refugees, until it reviews the policy in October.
""I am deeply disappointed by the court’s decision … the suspension of refugee resettlement will impact the most vulnerable of the world's populations,"" Eric Schwartz, president of Refugees International, said in a statement sent to Al Jazeera.
US President Donald Trump claims the order, originally signed in March after a similar ban was struck down in February, is necessary for the US to revamp its screening protocols for refugees. He said the decision was a ""clear victory"" for national security in a statement on Monday.
OPINION: The Muslim ban and the ethnic cleansing of America
Schwartz disagreed: ""There is no reasonable national security justification for these measures."" According to reports, no refugees have been responsible for fatal attacks in the US since the Refugee Act of 1980 set up systematic procedures for accepting refugees into the country.
The ban takes effect 72 hours after the injunction is lifted - Thursday morning in the US. It places a 90-day freeze on visas to travellers from Syria, Iran, Somalia, Sudan, Libya, and Yemen - as well as a 120-day freeze on the nation's refugee programme.
The court made an important exception, saying the ban ""may not be enforced against foreign nationals who have a credible claim of a bona fide relationship with a person or entity in the United States"".
The exception granted to those with ""bona fide"" relationships means that refugees and travellers should have familial, work or education connections to the US, such as a spouse, job offer or acceptance at a domestic university.
Betsy Fisher, lawyer and policy director for the International Refugee Assistance Project (IRAP), a party named in one of the cases against the ban, told Al Jazeera that the extent to which the reinstatement will affect refugees remains to be seen.
""I think a lot of it will depend on how the phrase 'bona fide relationship to the US' will be determined,"" Fisher said. The relationship exception was made because the challenges to the ban came from individuals and organisations whose families and employees would be affected.
Asylum seekers from Iraq often have familial relationships or a work history with the US military, said Fisher. According to the US Census, there are more than 215,000 people of Iraqi ancestry living in the country as of 2015. Thousands received visas through the Special Immigrant Visa programme, created specifically for Iraqis who had assisted the US since it invaded the country in 2003.
This means Iraqi refugees could more easily prove their bona fides compared with Syrians or Sudanese. Individuals from these nations have smaller US populations - 82,681 and 46,037, respectively - and no similar visa programmes, Fisher observed. The burden of bona fide tests could ""prove unworkable"", according to the partial dissenting opinion from Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas. Consular officials must now decide, ""on peril of contempt"", whether people from the banned nations have a sufficient connection to persons or entities in the US, and face a ""flood of litigation"" from those denied, Thomas said.
Akila Radhakrishnan, vice-president and legal director of the Global Justice Center, a New York-based group that works for gender equality and protection of vulnerable groups, told Al Jazeera in an interview the ban's reinstatement was a ""serious issue"" for endangered minorities in all six of the nations included on the ban, owing to their limited connections to the US.
Religious minorities such as the Yazidis, the majority of whom live in Iraq but are also found in Syria and Iran, are an example. The sect is insular, keeping marriages and other relationships within their own communities. Estimates place their US population in the low thousands and they are predominately found in one city in Nebraska.
OPINION: How the Muslim Ban incites vigilante Islamophobic violence
Rather than coming through a temporary non-immigrant visa - as Iraqis are entitled to after having their nation removed from the original ban - these and other vulnerable populations would be likely to travel to the US as asylum seekers.
""By limiting it to bona fide … you're limiting the scope of the protections"" given to refugees by international law, Radhakrishnan said. Even those from larger groups in Iraq and other nations aren't guaranteed to meet the “bona fide” standard, she explained.
Radhakrishnan argues that the ban's reinstatement also costs the US status in the international community, as it is a ""policy based on racism and xenophobia"".
In spite of the court's decision, groups such as IRAP and the American Civil Liberties Union, which said it was confident the ban will be struck down ""once and for all"" come October, vowed to continue advocating for those in need.
IRAP's Fisher said ""a lot remains to be seen"", but they ""look forward to the decision in October"".

The action on Monday was hailed as a win by the right-wing leader, who has insisted the ban is necessary for national security, despite severe criticism that it singles out Muslims in violation of the US constitution.
The justices at the highest US court narrowed the scope of lower court rulings that had completely blocked Trump's March 6 executive order. They also agreed to hear the government's appeals in the cases.
OPINION: The Muslim ban and the ethnic cleansing of America
Trump's executive order suspends new visas being issued to people from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen for at least 90 days. It also partly allows a 120-day ban on all refugees entering the United States to go into effect.
Both bans are now due to partly go into effect in 72 hours, based on a memorandum issued by the Trump administration on June 14.
In agreeing to hear the case later this year, the Supreme Court is allowing parts of the order to go ahead.
Specifically, the court said the executive order would be enforced on foreign nationals who did not have a ""credible claim of a bona fide relationship"" with a US person or organisation.
In effect, that means that individuals from the designated countries who have never been to the US before or lacked a relationship with an American or American organisation could still have their visa denied during the three-month period.
But what a ""bona fide relationship"" exactly constitutes is a matter of dispute.
OPINION: How Muslim Ban incites vigilante Islamophobic violence
In a dissenting opinion, Justice Clarence Thomas warned that requiring officials to differentiate between foreigners who have a connection to the US and those who do not will prove ""unworkable"".
""Today's compromise will burden executive officials with the task of deciding - on peril of contempt - whether individuals from the six affected nations who wish to enter the United States have a sufficient connection to a person or entity in this country"".
He added that the decision would result in a ""flood of litigation"" until the court issued its ruling.
Shortly after the court issued its opinion, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) said on Twitter it would ""head back into court to fight the fundamentally unconstitutional Muslim ban this October"".
No, @POTUS, today's Supreme Court decision does not allow your travel ban to take effect. We look forward to seeing you in court. https://t.co/nCH2CAf9aP

But Trump praised the decision, saying in a statement it allowed his travel ban ""to become largely effective"".
""Today's unanimous Supreme Court decision is a clear victory for our national security,"" Trump said, adding that the ruling allowed him ""to use an important tool for protecting our nation's homeland"".
Al Jazeera's Kimberly Halkett, reporting from Washington, DC, said that Trump was portraying the decision as a clear victory - even though this was a view that was not shared by everyone.
""The president in his statement is celebrating a victory. The court really upheld the cracks of the government's case, although saying it will be looking at this case in October,"" she said.
""The court upheld a 1952 law that gives the president broad powers about immigration when there are concerns about national security.""

Earlier this month, at least 126 asylum seekers en route to Europe drowned in the Mediterranean Sea after the motor of their boat was stolen, causing it to sink, the UN migration agency has said.
Gangs in Libya have built a lucrative trade out of packing refugees into rickety boats heading for Italy, where more than 65,000 have arrived so far this year.
As of June 14, 1,828 people are believed to have died trying to reach Europe, according to IOM figures.
Debate over dealing with the refugee influx is becoming increasingly bitter in Italy, whose economy is lagging behind its European peers before national elections next year.
The IOM recently said that hundreds of African refugees and migrants passing through Libya have been bought and sold in modern-day slave markets before being held for ransom or used as forced labour or for sexual exploitation.
People are bought for between $200 and $500 and are held on average for two to three months, Othman Belbeisi, head of the IOM's Libya mission, said in Geneva earlier this year.
""Selling human beings is becoming a trend among smugglers as the smuggling networks in Libya are becoming stronger and stronger,"" he said.

Police said that 79 people were dead, or missing and assumed dead, after the blaze rapidly spread through the 24-storey Grenfell Tower, which was built in 1974, on June 14.
Detective Superintendent Fiona McCormack said the Hotpoint model, FF175BP, was not subject to recall and that the manufacturer was doing further tests.
""We now have expert evidence that the fire was not started deliberately,"" McCormack said before adding the police were considering manslaughter charges given the high number of deaths.
Police were also investigating companies involved in the building and refurbishment of the tower, and possible ""health and safety and fire safety offences"", she said.
Exterior cladding and tiles recovered from the building have failed fire safety tests, said McCormack.
The cladding was installed on the council-owned building as part of a refurbishment completed last year.
Whirlpool Corp, the world's largest maker of home appliances, owns the Hotpoint brand in the Europe and Asia Pacific regions. In the United States, the brand now belongs to Haier, following the Chinese group's purchase of General Electric Co's appliance business.

""We are working with the authorities to obtain access to the appliance so that we can assist with the ongoing investigations,"" Whirpool said in a statement.
""Words cannot express our sorrow at this terrible tragedy.""
The blaze prompted a wider review of social housing which has identified at least 600 towers in England with similar cladding.
McCormack repeated calls for anyone with information on who might have been in the tower to come forward.
""What we haven't got is a picture of how many people might have been in there. That's the number I'm really worried about,"" she said.
Police fear the death toll may be higher because some residents may have been living in the tower illegally.
""Our forensic search may not be complete until the end of the year,"" she added.
Prime Minister Theresa May stressed on Thursday that all victims, regardless of their immigration status, would be able to access whatever help they need.

The UN's Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and South Sudan's National Bureau of Statistics said the situation remains critical, warning that an estimated six million people, half the population, will face extreme food shortages between June and July.
""People are in a catastrophic situation,"" said Serge Tissot, of FAO.
The country's government said its urgent response to the emergency situation averted a humanitarian catastrophe in the country.
""The government of South Sudan has done tremendously well. And now South Sudan has moved away from near famine in some parts of the country to food insecurity,"" Ateny Wek Ateny, South Sudan's presidential spokesman, told Al Jazeera.
OPINION: The world has abandoned South Sudanese refugees
In February, South Sudan declared two counties in Unity State to be in famine. Although those areas are still in critical condition, early detection and a rapid response succeeded in pulling them out of famine, a Phase 5 classification, the World Food Programme (WFP) said.
The UN food agency warned that the crisis is worsening and that removing the label of famine does not mean the situation has actually improved.
""We no longer have a famine in a number of counties that were declared to be in famine conditions in February this year,"" Joyce Luma, WFP's country director, told Al Jazeera.
""The bad news is we have more people facing acute hunger than before. Six million classified as facing acute hunger. This is one million more people facing acute hunger than in February,"" she said.
An estimated 45,000 people still face starvation in Leer, Koch and Mayendit counties, with additional areas across the country having deteriorated as well.

In former Jonglei state, an area that previously had one of the lowest levels of acute malnutrition, roughly 20,000 people are experiencing catastrophic food insecurity.
South Sudan was plunged into conflict in December 2013 as rivalry between President Salva Kiir and his then vice president, Riek Machar, turned into a civil war.
Since then the fighting, which has often been along ethnic lines, triggered Africa's worst refugee crisis, with more than three million people fleeing their homes.

The record number includes 22.5 million refugees, 40.3 million internally displaced people and 2.8 million asylum seekers.
The number marks a jump of 300,000 from the end of 2015, according to a new report released by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) on Monday.
This is ""the highest figure since we started recording these figures"", UNHCR chief Filippo Grandi told reporters ahead of the report launch.
""By any measure, this is an unacceptable number, and it speaks louder than ever to the need for solidarity and common purpose in preventing and resolving crises,"" he said.
READ MORE: ‘Staggering’ increase in number of lone child refugees
The figures released ahead of World Refugee Day on Tuesday showed that 10.3 million of the world's displaced people fled their homes last year alone, including 3.4 million who crossed international borders to become refugees.
""This equates to one person becoming displaced every three seconds - less than the time it takes to read this sentence,"" UNHCR pointed out in a statement.
At the end of 2016, there were about 40.3 million internally displaced people in the world, down slightly from 40.8 million a year earlier, with Syria, Iraq and Colombia accounting for the greatest numbers.
Another 22.5 million people - half of them children - were registered as refugees last year, the UNHCR report showed, pointing out that this is ""the highest level ever recorded"".
Syrians continued to be the largest forcibly displaced population, with 12 million people at the end of 2016.
Syria's six-year conflict alone has sent more than 5.5 million people seeking safety in other countries, including 825,000 last year alone, accounting for the world's largest group of refugees.
READ MORE: Syria's civil war explained from the beginning
Along with the 6.3 million Syrians displaced inside the country, these numbers show that nearly two thirds of all Syrians have been forced from their homes, the report said.
The Syrian conflict, which has killed more than 320,000 people, ""is becoming a forgotten crisis"", he warned.
The UN refugee chief also voiced alarm over the rapidly deteriorating situation in South Sudan, which he said was currently the world's ""fastest growing refugee crisis and displacement crisis"".
South Sudan's civil war, which began in December 2013, has left tens of thousands dead and forced a total of 3.7 million people from their homes - nearly a third of the population.
Overall, the refugee population from the world's youngest country swelled 85 percent last year to reach 1.4 million by the end of 2016, the UNHCR report showed.
Besides Syria and South Sudan, Monday's report also pointed to large-scale displacement in Afghanistan, Iraq and Sudan.
And nearly 70 years after Palestinians first fled today's Israel, some 5.3 million Palestinians are currently living as refugees - the highest level ever recorded, UNHCR said.
The report showed despite huge focus on Europe's refugee crisis, it is the poorer countries that host most of the world's refugees.
For the third consecutive year, Turkey hosted the largest number of refugees worldwide, with 2.9 million people.
It was followed by Pakistan (1.4 million), Lebanon (1 million), Iran (979,400), Uganda (940,800), and Ethiopia (791,600).

The men said that after a few hours at sea a group of Libyan traffickers intercepted their boat, he added.
""They stole the motor - something which has happened a few times recently - and at that point, the boat started to take on water and sank.""
Passing Libyan fishermen rescued the four survivors - two Sudanese and two Nigerian men, and put them on another boat with about 1,000 other refugees. They were eventually rescued and brought to the Sicilian port of Palermo.
""They were in shock, traumatised by what had happened, and exhausted,"" Di Giacomo said, adding that there were no official witnesses to what had happened, but refugees from the second boat had confirmed the account.
Gangs in Libya have built a lucrative trade out of packing refugees into rickety boats heading for Italy, where more than 65,000 have arrived so far this year.
As of June 14, 1,828 people are believed to have died trying to reach Europe, according to IOM figures.

The crowds chanted, ""No human being is illegal"", as they walked in scorching heat, past clothes shops in central Madrid, holding banners that read, ""Open the borders"", ""Bridges, not walls"" and ""Enough with excuses, no more barriers"".
Saturday's protest, organised by dozens of NGOs, including UK-based rights group Amnesty International, comes just a few days before World Refugee Day on Tuesday.
Organisers, quoted by local media, said some 8,000 people attended the demonstration.
The protest also comes as the deadline nears to relocate 160,000 refugees across Europe under a solidarity plan put in place in 2015 to try to remedy the continent's biggest-ever refugee crisis and ease the burden on front-line states Italy and Greece.
However, by the start of June, fewer than 20,000 refugees had been relocated.
Spain, which had pledged to take in more than 17,300, has so far only welcomed just over 1,300, according to Amnesty.
""Spain is doing absolutely nothing of what it should be doing, it's a disgrace for Spain and Europe,"" Carlos Diez, a 55-year-old secondary school teacher at the protest, told the AFP news agency.
Estrella Moran, secretary-general of the Spain Commission for Refugee Assistance (CEAR), said the period for the first arrivals ends next month, while the second period will be over on September 26.
""At the moment only 7.5 percent of these persons have been accommodated,"" Moran told the Associated Press news agency. ""There are people in Greece that are living in inhumane conditions and unhealthy situations, there are people in Turkey, in Lebanon and Palestine that deserve that we give them a start in a new life.""
Also at the march was Christian Lele, a 27-year-old from Cameroon who entered Spain without documents in 2014 by climbing over a border fence in Melilla, a tiny Spanish enclave in the northeast of Morocco.
""I wanted to study, change my life, help my family … You can't live well (in Cameroon) with the little they pay you,"" he told AFP.

Lele got to Morocco a year after he left his country, by hitching rides across the continent.
Once in Melilla, he was eventually taken to a refugee reception centre in Malaga in southern Spain, and was transferred to several others across the country before he got to Madrid.
He trained as a gardener, which is now his job in the Spanish capital. He also said he was on the march in ""solidarity"" with others who would follow in his footsteps.
In February, at least 160,000 people marched in Barcelona to demand the Spanish government fulfil its commitment on refugees.

Police Commander Stuart Cundy said the latest number, which was based on reports from the public, may rise and includes the 30 deaths that have already been confirmed after Wednesday's blaze at the west London 24-storey building. He said it will take weeks or longer to recover and identify all the dead.
""Sadly, at this time there are 58 people who we have been told were in the Grenfell Tower on the night that are missing, and therefore sadly, I have to assume that they are dead,"" he said.
Cundy said there may have been other people in the tower that police are not aware of, which would add to the final death toll. He asked anyone who was in the tower and survived to contact police immediately.
The first victim has been formally identified as 23-year-old Mohammed Alhajali, a Syrian refugee who lived in Grenfell Tower.
Police say the harrowing search for remains had been paused on Friday because of safety concerns at the blacked tower but has now resumed, with emergency workers reaching the top of the tower.
The identification of the victims is proving very difficult - which experts attribute to the extreme heat of the fire. British health authorities say that 19 fire survivors are still being treated at London hospitals, and 10 of them remain in critical condition.
Cundy said police will investigate the tower's refurbishment project, which experts believe may have left the building in the North Kensington area more vulnerable to a catastrophic blaze.
The government has promised a full public inquiry, but that has done little to a sense of frustration and anger among residents and neighbours who demand answers for how the blaze spread so quickly and trapped so many of the tower's roughly 600 residents.
Some Grenfell Tower residents had warned months ago fire safety issues at the building meant that it was at risk of a ""catastrophic"" event.
They say their complaints were ignored - and fear it was because the tower housed mainly poor people in an extremely wealthy neighbourhood.
British media have reported that contractors installed a cheaper, less flame-resistant type of exterior panelling on the tower in a renovation that was completed just last year.
British Prime Minister Theresa May, facing criticism for the government's handling of the disaster, on Saturday met a small group of fire survivors at her official residence at 10 Downing Street.
The meeting is unlikely to quell complaints that May has been slow to reach out to victims, despite her announcement of a $6.4m emergency fund to help the displaced families. May was jeered on Friday after she visited the affected community.
READ MORE: Grenfell fire - Protests, anger as death toll rises
Al Jazeera's Sonia Gallego, reporting from west London, said there has been a lot of distress in the area at the slow release of information and the perceived lacklustre response by the authorities.
""There is also a lot of anger and frustration at the lack of any kind of presence here of the local council. The local community really has been spearheading a lot of the support here to try to give those affected by the fire food, water and shelter,"" she said.
The tragedy has provoked a huge response from nearby communities. More than three million pounds ($3.8m) have been raised for the affected families.
Hundreds have been left homeless by the blaze, putting more pressure on officials in a city plagued by a chronic housing shortage. Many of the displaced are living in churches and community centres.
So far, 109 families have been given temporary accommodation by in hotels within the local area, Gallego said.
""But it is still not 100 percent certain if they will be [permanently] re-housed in the borough. That is very controversial here, as it is a place that people have made their homes, have families, and have networks,"" she added.
Scuffles broke out near the Kensington and Chelsea town hall offices on Friday as demonstrators chanting ""We want justice!"" surged towards the doors.
Engineering experts and fire safety specialists believe the building's exterior cladding may have quickly fuelled the blaze, overwhelming fire protection devices. British officials have ordered a review of other buildings that have had similar renovations.
The use of flammable cladding in tall buildings is banned in some countries, including the United States and Germany. Grenfell residents also claimed that newly installed gas pipes running up the inside of the building were not boxed in with fire-retardant covers, and there was no sprinkler system.
Ronnie King, the UK's former chief fire officer, told Al Jazeera: ""I wouldn't wish to denigrate those who installed the cladding because - whatever the cladding was - it did not have to be fire resistant under the building regulations,"" said King.
""We were seeking a change to the building regulations for that very purpose.""
King also said that there are around 4,000 tower blocks in the UK without automatic fire sprinkler protection systems in place.
""We've long been advocates of automatic fire sprinkler protection in tall tower blocks and they work - people don't die in sprinkler buildings,"" he said.
Two Underground lines near the fire area were partially shut down on Saturday to make sure that debris did not land on the tracks.

The UN's humanitarian chief Lise Grande said in an interview on Friday with The Associated Press that the global body expects the final battle for the Old City to start ""within days"". She said conditions there ""are desperate"" and the UN expects almost all civilians to try to escape.
US-backed Iraqi forces have been battling fighters from the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL, also known as ISIS) in Mosul since October. ISIL now control only a handful of neighbourhoods in and around the Old City.
Grande said there have been more than 7,000 gunshot wounds of people trying to leave districts still controlled by ISIL.
""The reason we know that they're being shot at by snipers and not crossfire is because they're being shot in the back,"" she said.
Around 860,000 people have already fled Mosul, which was ""beyond the worst case"" scenario of 750,000 that the UN had planned for, said Grande.
The UN and Iraqi authorities have coordinated to build new camps and find spaces in existing camps for families returning to already recaptured eastern Mosul.
Grande said the Iraqi forces have tried to keep the daily flight of people below the saturation point of 20,000 when they attack a neighbourhood.
""We're averaging between 8,000 and 15,000 a day,"" she said.
Al Jazeera's Bernard Smith, reporting from the city of Erbil, east of Mosul, said that trapped civilians were reportedly without food or running water in the Old City, and that - while Iraqi forces have dropped leaflets urging residents to flee before the final battle for control of the area - ISIL are shooting people that try to leave and are even welding doors shut.
""All indications are that it's going to get much much worse for the civilians trapped in the city before it's going to get any better,"" said Smith.
OPINION: Iraq deserves heroes, but only has monsters
Our correspondent said that the final battle in the dense streets of the Old City - believed to be held by around 1,000 ISIL fighters preparing to fight to the death - means that a large number of civilians will be trapped amid what the US-led coalition has described as possibly being some of the toughest urban fighting in recent decades.
""The Iraqi forces have done an awful lot to reduce the number of civilian casualties, air strikes are much more carefully considered before they are called in,"" he said.
""The problem with having air strikes in this part of the Old City is because it is so built-up and dense, it is very difficult to avoid civilian casualties - that battle for the Old City is going to be perhaps the most challenging and difficult fight for all those fights for Mosul,"" he said.
Amira Abd El Khalek, public information officer with the UN's refugee agency, told Al Jazeera that the UN's was ""extremely concerned"" about the remaining civilians in Mosul and that their top priority is to get them out safely as soon as possible.
""As long as there are safe passages that the Iraqi forces are able to establish, then civilians can move out. However, the civilians are trapped inside their homes, it is extremely difficult for them to get out because they are targeted by snipers,"" she said from Erbil.
""So unless safe passages are available then it will be very difficult for civilians to get out. They are trapped inside with very little food and very little water. Some resort to drinking sewage water and there is no fuel left. So it is a very dire situation,"" said El Khalek.

On Monday, protesters attacked a branch of the Supreme Court with petrol bombs and damaged a bank in the same building, which was engulfed in flames and smoke.
Several protesters were injured as security guards tried to repel them.
Speaking in Madrid, Kuczynski said Venezuela's months-long political and economic crisis, which has seen thousands march for and against the government of President Nicolas Maduro, could force people to leave the country in droves.
""If nothing is done, it will end in a bloodbath. There will be a [migratory] invasion in Cucuta [in Colombia],"" said Kuczynski, a sharp critic of Maduro.
""Two or three democratic countries"" could join several other allies of Venezuela as part of the commission, Kuczynski suggested, judging that all other attempts at easing the situation through multilateral organisations have failed.
He added that Venezuelans could also start crossing over to the Dutch island of Curacao north of their country in boats.
More than 60 people have been killed and hundreds more arrested during months of violent clashes in Venezuela.

Luisa Ortega, a former ally of President Maduro who has turned against him and the ruling Socialist Party, questioned Maduro's handling of opposition street protests in recent weeks and challenged his plan to rewrite a constitution brought in by the late leader Hugo Chavez.
""Somebody is threatening my family,"" she said in a radio interview. ""They harass them. They follow them, patrol cars that look like SEBIN,"" she said, referring to the Bolivarian Intelligence Service.
Police arrested 24 people for their involvement in the daylight attack on a busy office block on Monday, which was condemned by President Maduro as a terrorist act.
Opposition leader Henrique Capriles said it was the work of government agitators.

Outside the Supreme Court headquarters in downtown Caracas, protesters backing Ortega were confronted earlier by government supporters.
Maduro says Venezuela is the victim of an ""economic war"" that he says can only be addressed by a constituent assembly.
The elections council has set an election for the assembly for July 30. The opposition is refusing to participate in the vote, saying it is rigged in favour of the Socialist Party.
A group of Venezuelan university students is walking across the country in protest against the government.
The group, which calls itself 380 Kilometers for Venezuela, is made up of several university student groups outside Caracas, and set out to journey nearly 380km from the city of Barquisimeto - the capital of the northwestern Lara state - over the weekend.
""We are against the Constituent, against repression ... We are doing this daily, walking sector by sector and we hope that people will join us; that other student movements join us to achieve tangible change in the current situation in Venezuela,"" said Aime Enege, medical student and representative for the group.
As the political and economic situation becomes increasingly volatile, senior citizens in Venezuela are suffering the most.
Nine out of 10 Venezuelans are not earning enough to cover their basic needs, and 63 percent do not have health insurance.
Venezuela also has the highest elderly poverty rate in the region.

The Iraqi Red Crescent had said on Tuesday that a woman and a child had died due to the outbreak, while UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) reported the death of a six-year-old girl earlier on Tuesday. UNHCR has since said that no one has died as a result of the outbreak, despite its earlier report. ""We are now informed that this information was incorrect - that in fact, there currently have been no fatalities as a result of the incident,"" UNHCR said in a statement.
A non-governmental organisation delivered the food, which included rice, yogurt, chicken and soup, to the Hasansham U2 camp from a restaurant in Ebril, according to reports.
The Kurdish news agency Rudaw, citing Erbil's mayor, said the owner of the restaurant that made the food had been arrested.
Authorities have launched a formal investigation into the incident, officials said.
The camp is in al-Khazer on the road linking Mosul and Erbil and houses those displaced due to the ongoing offensive to retake Mosul from the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL, also known as ISIS) group.
According to the UN refugee agency, more than 6,000 people currently live inside the camp.
OPINION: Iraq deserves heroes, but only has monsters
A US-backed military operation to retake ISIL's last three remaining enclaves outside Mosul's Old City began last month - the latest push in a major operation that began in October.
Aid groups have repeatedly expressed their concerns over the safety of hundreds of thousands of civilians who have been forced to flee and are at risk of being caught in the crossfire.
Almost 10,000 people fled from Mosul's northwest and the Old City every day during the last week of May, the UN said.
More than 750,000 people have been displaced from the city since October.

Adnan Abu Hasna, a Gaza-based spokesman for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA), said Netanyahu was pursuing a ""fantasy"".
The United States, Israel's main ally, was the biggest donor to UNRWA last year, pledging $368 million.
In public remarks to his cabinet at its weekly meeting, Netanyahu said UNRWA perpetuated, rather than solved, the Palestinian refugee problem and that it stoked anti-Israeli sentiment.
""It is time UNRWA be dismantled and merged with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees,"" Netanyahu said.
Referring to a meeting he held in Jerusalem on Wednesday with Nikki Haley, the US ambassador to the UN, Netanyahu said: ""I told her it was time the United Nations re-examine UNRWA's existence.""
UNRWA was established by the UN General Assembly in 1949 after hundreds of thousands of Palestinians fled or were expelled from their homes in the 1948 war that followed Israel's creation.
It says it currently aids five million registered Palestinian refugees in the Middle East.

Netanyahu made his comments two days after UNRWA said it had discovered part of a tunnel running under two of its schools in the Gaza Strip's Maghazi refugee camp.
UNRWA said it had protested to Hamas, the group that rules the enclave and which had used a network of cross-border tunnels to launch attacks inside Israel in a 2014 war.
Hamas denied the accusations, calling them ""Israeli fabrications"".
“The Israeli claims regarding discovering alleged tunnels underneath the UNRWA school are classic Israeli lies aiming to dehumanise the Palestinian refugees,"" senior Hamas leader and spokesman Izzat al-Rishq told Al Jazeera.
""This is not the first time the Israeli government tries to spread such lies in order to destroy the work of UNRWA in helping Palestinian refugees get their education.”
Rishq said Netanyahu's call to dismantle UNRWA was ""part of the Israeli plan to eliminate the Palestinian refugee problem once and for all"".
UNRWA's Gunness said the agency had ""robustly intervened and protested to Hamas in Gaza"".
He said UNRWA would seal the tunnel, which was discovered while the schools were empty during the summer holiday.
Over the years, Hamas has built a labyrinth of tunnels, some passing under the border into Israel in order to launch attacks.
Israel has besieged the Gaza Strip, home to nearly two million people, since Hamas wrested control of the territory from the rival Fatah movement of Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas in 2007. Since then, it has conducted three major assaults on the territory.

Qatari support comes in the form of humanitarian projects to improve the lives of the two million people of Gaza, which has been under an Israeli-Egyptian blockade.
It has built a housing complex for thousands of families, paved major roads across Gaza, built a hospital and funded the reconstruction of hundreds of houses that were destroyed or damaged during a 50-day war with Israel in 2014.
Now with a crisis looming between Qatar and its Arab neighbours, residents in Gaza expect worse to come.
""If this happens though, and Qatar does withdraw its support, it will severely effect the people of Gaza, especially because Qatar is a huge financier of reconstruction projects after the war and charity work,"" Ahmed Rezeq, 25, an entrepreneur told Al Jazeera.

A heavy police presence blocked off all access to the Elliniko airport site in the early hours of Friday, denying entry to journalists, as men, women and children collected their belongings and began boarding buses to camps elsewhere in Greece.
Police had previously said up to 500 people, mainly families, would go to a camp outside the town of Thebes, about 70km northwest of Athens.
The remainder of mainly single people, estimated at more than 150, would be taken to Athens' aliens department for identity verification, before being moved to facilities outside of the capital.
Elliniko #refugeesGR camp eviction started w/ GR riot police entering the premises to remove people. Journalists not allowed as per usual https://t.co/jfzwtUWUHt
Activists gathered outside the old airport to protest against the police operation, and decried the transfer of single people to the department on Petrou Ralli Street as ""nothing else than a deportation procedure"".
""Police went in violently and occupied the spaces in order to move the refugees to areas they do not want,"" Petros Konstantinou said, a left-wing Athens city councillor and coordinator for United Movement Against Racism and the Fascist Threat, told Al Jazeera from outside Elliniko.
""Police arrested the camp's leaders, including Masoud Qahar, under the pretence of identity verification,"" he added.
Qahar, a former logistical officer with NATO who fled Afghanistan after he says he received death threats from the Taliban, has helped organise protests for better living conditions in Greece's refugee camps.
A spokesman for Greek police told Al Jazeera that he could not comment on the issue as the operation was still under way.

Human rights groups criticised conditions at Elliniko, which had been home to around 2,000 mostly Afghans, as deplorable and unfit for humans. Hundreds slept crammed in tents in the old arrivals terminal last summer in scorching temperatures with little food.
Over the past 10 days, Elliniko's residents were asked to willingly relocate to official camps, mostly outside Athens. Non-governmental organisations operating at the camp also left the site.
Greek officials reportedly said that 90 percent of refugees at Elliniko said they would relocate voluntarily, while the rest objected to being transferred.
But Konstantinou said that about 150 people staying at the arrivals terminal were against their transfer outside the capital.
""We spoke to them on Thursday night, and all of them said they did not want to move outside Athens. They want to be relocated to apartments in the city and better access to food services,"" he said.
Activists close to refugees told Al Jazeera that the refusal of many long-term residents of Elliniko stemmed from the uncertainty over the conditions they would face at the new camps. The move could also limit much-needed access to legal and psychological support, they said.
""This is a serious and complex issue, as most of these people are very vulnerable and in need of specific help - from lawyers and counselling to psychologists and medicines,"" a Greek volunteer worker, who is in daily contact with refugees, said.

Others, mostly Afghans not eligible for a European relocation programme to other member states, feared that moving farther from Athens would make it harder to leave Greece.
""The refugees have the right to live in humane conditions and not be transferred to another 'ghetto' camp like the one in Thebes or elsewhere,"" Maria Bikaki, of the SYPROME solidarity group, told Al Jazeera.
""These are remote, isolated camps and completely unsuitable for vulnerable people and families - there is even a newborn child among those who are transferred,"" she added.
According to SYPROME, the fenced camp outside Thebes is located next to a power plant and 12km from the nearest hospital, with only one coach service running throughout the day. Refugees there will live in containers - both during summer and winter - that can host up to eight people.
> If #refugeesgr deside to stay out of camps, they don't get the cash card. Also if they leave a camp, they cannot easily get back in.
The refugees were first taken to Elliniko in November 2015 when police began transferring large numbers from the Greece-Macedonia border.
The government had long promised to empty the site, which it has agreed to lease to private investors under its bailout programme, but struggled to convince the refugees to move to other camps in the mainland.
More than 62,000 migrants and refugees heading to northern Europe have been stranded in Greece since countries in the Balkans shut their borders to those seeking passage in March last year.
Konstantinou, the Athens councillor, accused the Greek government and European authorities of ""toughening their stance"" against refugees and succumbing to pressure from an emerging ""far-right sentiment across Europe"".

The Global Report on Internal Displacement by the Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre (IDMC) of the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) found that on average, one person was forced to flee every second in 2016, a trend it called a ""horrific"" new level of displacement.
Disasters displaced three times more people than conflicts, with most of the 24 million people affected by sudden-onset weather hazards such as floods, storms, wildfires and severe winter conditions.
In total, 31.1 million new cases of internal displacements were reported in 125 countries last year.
The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), with 922,000 new displacements in 2016, topped the list of countries where this displacement was driven by conflict while 7,434,000 people in China were forced to flee their homes due to natural disasters.
The UN refugee agency UNHCR put the number of refugees in 2015 at 21.3 million with 53 percent of those coming from Somalia, Afghanistan and Syria.
But despite the increasing numbers of the internally displaced people (IDPs), their plight was being overshadowed and becoming difficult to place on the international agenda, according to the IDMC.
""Absolutely, that's one of our main regrets [IDP issue being overlooked],"" Alexandra Bilak, IDMC director, told Al Jazeera.
""Internal displacement is a politically sensitive issue. Refugees and migrants are driven by the fact that they arrive in Europe and put themselves on the radar screens of international and western policymakers. It is a visible phenomenon.""
More aid was spent last year on refugee resettlement than in the countries where the crises began, said the IDMC.
""The IDPs are behind the sovereignty of a country's border and are far less visible. People tend not to think about them as readily as refugees and migrants.""
The total number of IDPs has doubled since 2000 and stands at 40.3 million as of December 2016. The numbers are likely to rise further if conditions stay the same as last year, said Bilak.
""Looking at the conflicts around the world as well as climate change issues, we don't expect the numbers to go down anytime soon in either case [conflict or natural disasters]. The only way the numbers can decrease is if there is more investment on working on the underlying drivers that force people to flee - poverty reduction, peace building and climate change.""
The report also highlighted the intensity of the humanitarian crisis in Congo and how there is a ""need for more development spending to be allocated to reducing existing vulnerabilities and future risk and for mitigating the longer-term impacts of internal displacement"".
Almost five million people were killed in Congo between 1994 and 2003 as a result of ethnic violence. Almost 19,000 UN troops are currently protecting Congolese people from violence in Congo amid calls by the United States to reduce that number despite increasing attacks and instability.
""That DRC figure really took us all a bit by surprise. Over the last four to five years, it was usually the Middle East that was consistently high on the list and DRC had fallen off the agenda,"" said Bilak.
""It's unrealistic to expect the international community to solve a problem as huge as the DRC alone. It's a protracted crisis. There is very little humanitarian assistance on the ground in some parts.""
The Syrian refugee crisis remains one of the largest humanitarian crises since the end of World War II.
The number of refugees who have fled the country now exceeds five million, including more than 2.4 million children, and millions more have been displaced internally, according to the UN.
At least 23,544 civilians were displaced between May 18 and 22, 2016, added the UN.
""People say displacement is a domestic issue and should be resolved at a domestic level. Many see it as an encroachment at national sovereignty. Internal displacement requires its own set of principles and the approach is very different from the refugee and migrant issue.""
Additionally, many refugees returning to their home country fear the risk of being internally displaced once they return. Large-scale returns were mirrored by a considerable increase in the number of IDPs in 46 percent of cases between 2000 and 2016, according to the World Bank.
The IDMC presented the case of around 600,000 Afghans returning from Pakistan. UNHCR estimates that around half of them were unable to return to their place of origin.
Destructive floods and landslides in northern China killed at least 154 people and accounted for the majority of those displaced.
Typhoons, floods and landslides were the major causes of displacement in Philippines (5.9 million), India (2.4 million) and Indonesia (1.2 million) last year.
Jan Egeland, the head of the NRC, said the shocking figures show the need to focus as much on people displaced inside their countries than on refugees who flee across borders.
""Internally displaced people now outnumber refugees by two to one. It is urgent to put internal displacement back on the global agenda,"" said Egeland.
A number of the IDPs, in search of improved conditions then cross over into a different country, said the IDMC. As a result, ""today's IDPs could become tomorrow's refugees"".
""We know there's an overlap but there is not enough data to be able to put a number to that phenomenon. We have the number of IDPs in a country but the minute they cross a border, not all of them appear on UNHCR registers. Many fall between the cracks. We know it's happening. In Syria, In sub-Saharan Africa. It happens across the board.""

Northern Cameroon has suffered from the overflow of violence linked to Boko Haram in recent years, which launches frequent cross-border raids.
Nigerian refugees have flooded across the border and local residents have been forced to flee their homes.

She broke down in tears on Thursday as she approached the school where the fighters rounded up the population of Kojo and separated the men from the women, part of a series of crimes the United Nations described as a genocide against the Yazidi minority.
""I have been waiting for this day for nearly three years,"" Murad said on the rooftop of the school, where she had studied for 11 years.
On her return, Murad went to see her house and emerged clutching some clothing left there since 2014. A Yazidi fighter said it belonged to Murad's mother, who was killed during the purge because she was considered too old to be taken as a slave.
READ MORE: Dozens of Yazidi 'slaves' rescued by Iraqi troops
Several hundred men were gunned down on the edge of the village. Among them were six of Murad's brothers and stepbrothers.
""We hoped our fate would be to be killed like the men instead of being sold and raped by Syrians, Iraqis ... Tunisians and Europeans,"" Murad said after composing herself, speaking from the roof of the school.
The Yazidis are a religious community of about 400,000, whose beliefs combine elements of several ancient Middle Eastern religions. ISIL considers them devil worshippers.
She said the ISIL commander who oversaw what happened at the school was an Arab from the area. ""He demanded we change our religion but nobody agreed.
""We heard the sound of shots. At first we believed people had come to help us, but when we looked out of the windows ... we saw them killing the men.
""We cried to the UN, Europe, Kurdistan and Iraq but nobody came to help us,"" Murad said. ""Today the village is surrounded by mass graves.""
Murad, now 24, was taken in the summer of 2014 to Mosul, ISIL's de facto capital in Iraq. She escaped in November 2014.
She told her story to the UN Security Council in 2015 and since then she has become an advocate for the Yazidis and for refugee and women's rights in general. She and another Yazidi woman, Lamiya Aji Bashar, received the European Parliament's Sakharov Prize for freedom of thought.
WATCH: ISIL slept in our home
Kojo is one of the villages recaptured over the past few days by Popular Mobilisation, an Iraqi Shia paramilitary force trained by Iran.
One of Murad's brothers is now fighting with the paramilitaries who retook the area. The two were reunited in the village.
US-backed Kurdish forces dislodged ISIL from other Yazidi villages in the Sinjar region in 2015. Mosul is about to fall to a US-backed Iraqi offensive.
International human rights lawyer Amal Clooney, who represents Murad and other Yazidi victims, is lobbying the Iraqi government and the international community to allow a United Nations investigation into ISIL's crimes.
More than 3,000 women are believed still held captive by ISIL, according to the community's leaders.
""All we want,"" Murad said in Kojo, ""is people to save 3,000 women in the Daesh prisons and to document our graves ... Until now, not a single mass grave has been documented.""

""Hundreds of thousands of people do not receive the lifesaving help they need because of challenges in accessing communities,"" the council said before blaming ""a 40 percent shortage in funding and a lack of international media attention to the crisis"".

""Many of the displaced people have fled their homes multiple times, and each time they get increasingly vulnerable.""
Darfur has been unstable since 2003 when different groups complaining of marginalisation by the Sudanese government started an armed campaign.
The conflict attracted a government-backed militia known as the Janjaweed, who were blamed for widespread killings that have been labelled as genocide.

Babar Baloch, spokesman for the UN refugee agency UNHCR, told Al Jazeera: ""You have a situation where people are running from a conflict in South Kordofan [Sudan] and coming to South Sudan.
""But South Sudan is also in conflict, there is famine, more than half of the population is facing food insecurity and a quarter of them are displaced, including in Darfur and Kordofan.""

Unveiling its annual index, the aid agency said on Thursday that the world pays the least attention to humanitarian crises when they force Africans from their homes, dashing hopes of peace and raising the risk of escalated conflict.
In the NRC's list of the world's 10 most neglected displacement crises, CAR was followed by the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Sudan, South Sudan, Nigeria, Yemen, Palestine, Ukraine, Myanmar and Somalia.
""The fact that most of these people do not turn up at our doorsteps gives us no right to close our eyes to their suffering and does not remove our responsibility to assist,"" Jan Egeland, the NRC's secretary general, said in a statement.
OPINION: Jan Egeland - We cannot let down the Central African Republic again
The NRC analysed all countries worldwide in which more than 100,000 people are displaced.
The countries topping the list are characterised by insufficient economic support to meet the most basic humanitarian needs, limited media attention and lack of political will to solve the crises.
""The international community has not only forgotten these crises but has never really shown sufficient willingness to contribute to a solution,"" Egeland said.
""Economic support to alleviate humanitarian crises must be given based on needs, and not be subject to geopolitical interests.""
Chronic conflict involving militias in countries such as CAR and the Congo could drive more and more people into armed groups, said Richard Skretteberg, a senior NRC adviser.
In 2016, the United Nations only received 38 percent of the money it needed to distribute humanitarian aid in CAR.
Almost half of the population faces food insecurity, eating only one meal a day, according to the NRC report, while only 35 percent of people in CAR have access to clean water.
READ MORE: Tension high among CAR civilians as violence surges
""When you combine limited state presence in much of these countries, mass displacement, and a lack of protection and aid for civilians, this creates a fertile breeding ground for radicalisation,"" Skretteberg told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.
""Rebuilding and working towards peace are difficult when so many people are displaced,"" he added.
One in five Central Africans - about one million people - is displaced, and at least 100,000 were newly uprooted last month in some of the worst violence between the mainly Muslim Seleka rebels and Christian militias since the conflict began in 2013.
Spreading ethnic violence in the Congo has also forced more than 1.5 million people to flee their homes within the country this year - more than triple the number uprooted in Syria and five times the number in Iraq, according to the NRC.
The UN has received just one-fifth of the $812.5m sought in the humanitarian appeal for Congo this year, and 25 percent of the $400m requested for Central African Republic, the UN's Financial Tracking Service shows.
Africa's arid Sahel belt, which stretches from Senegal to Eritrea and lies south of the Sahara desert, topped the NRC's index last year, followed by Yemen and Libya.

Wednesday's suicide blast in Kabul's diplomatic district killed at least 90 people and left 400 others wounded.
While there has been no claim of responsibility, Afghanistan's intelligence agency has blamed Pakistan and the Taliban-linked Haqqani network for the attack.
The ACB, in a strongly worded statement, put the renewal of cricketing ties between the two countries on hold while effectively blaming Pakistan for having a hand in the Kabul bombing.
""By killing innocent and destitute people today, the enemies of Afghanistan's peace and stability showed that they are not worthy of friendship and will not change their stance against Afghans,"" the statement read.
@ACBofficials cancells friendly matches including initially agreed terms of mutual cricketing relationship with @TheRealPCB#kabulblast
""In light of findings of security services and calls by the Afghan people, the ACB hereby cancels all kinds of cricket matches and mutual relationship agreement with the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB).
""No agreement of friendly matches and mutual relationship agreement is valid with a country where terrorists are housed and provided safe havens.""
Last week, the ACB delegation, including its chairman Atif Mashal, had visited Lahore and agreed on resuming cricketing ties at youth and senior levels.
Pakistan were set to play their first Twenty20 match in Kabul later this year followed by a fixture in Pakistan and a full series at an unspecified date.
""We know there is tension in the border but it's my job to keep this interaction between two cricketing nations going and to help governments start something positive,"" Mashal had said in Lahore.
INTERACTIVE: Cricket Beyond Boundaries
""We are trying our best to keep sports, especially cricket, away from politics as well as looking for our national interests.""
On Thursday, the PCB also issued a statement rejecting what it termed ""baseless allegations"" about Pakistan backing terrorism while also claiming the PCB had cancelled a proposed cricket series on the basis of ongoing insecurity in Afghanistan.
""It is also deeply regrettable that the ACB delegation in Pakistan was at pains to insist that politics should not impinge on cricket but has now turned around and is playing politics by laying the blame for its own troubles and inadequacies on Pakistan,"" the PCB statement said.
""The PCB has always encouraged the development of cricket in Afghanistan and millions of Afghan refugees were first introduced to the game in Pakistan.
""Over the years, the PCB helped cricketers in Afghanistan develop their expertise and an entire generation of Afghan national players honed their cricketing skills in Pakistan.""
Cricket struggled to get a foothold in Afghanistan under the Taliban but became hugely popular since the group was toppled in 2001.
A number of Afghanistan players learnt how to play cricket in Pakistan. They were also regular fixtures during the short Ramadan leagues taking place in the southern Pakistan city of Karachi.
Relations between the two governments were dealt a big blow when at least 15 people were killed and dozens others wounded after a cross-border battle between the two sides during a Pakistani population census near the border last month.
The attack near the Chaman crossing point in Balochistan province prompted security forces to ask people to evacuate villages on the border.

Chaman, one of the two main border crossings between Pakistan and Afghanistan, was closed in the wake of the incident.
Afghanistan's foreign ministry said it had warned Pakistan against conducting the census in the villages in the border area, which remains disputed between the two countries.
Pakistan and Afghanistan share a roughly 2,500km border, which runs through mountainous terrain and remains largely unpoliced.
Recent Pakistani attempts to establish fences and border posts along the border, with the stated aim of curtailing the movement of Taliban fighters into Pakistan, have been resisted by Afghanistan.
In February, Pakistan sealed all border crossings with Afghanistan for over a month after a wave of attacks across Pakistan killed more than 100 people.

Bangladesh's border region, home to around 12,000 Rohingya refugees that fled Myanmar, faced the brunt of the storm. It struck the island of Saint Martin and Teknaf in the coastal district of Cox's Bazar, where officials said some 200,000 people were evacuated to shelters.
In Chittagong district, about 150,000 people were evacuated.
Shamsul Alam, a Rohingya community leader, told Reuters news agency the damage in the camps was severe with almost all 10,000 thatched huts in the Balukhali and Kutupalong camps destroyed.
""Most of the temporary houses in the camps have been flattened,"" Alam said.
The Bangladesh government estimates there are more than 300,000 Rohingya in the country. The Rohingya are a Muslim minority shunned by Myanmar's Buddhist majority.
""We heard that a cyclone was coming. But there's no place we can go,"" 27-year-old Hamida Begum, who said she fled to Bangladesh three months ago after her husband disappeared, told Reuters on Wednesday.
""I hate being a Rohingya. We are being tortured in Myanmar. Now in Bangladesh, we have no rights. Nothing. After this cyclone, we don't have a roof. We are living under the sky. We have no future.""
Authorities had evacuated more than 400,000 people from the low-lying border districts before the storm. However, most of the Rohingya refugees remained in their makeshift shelters when the storm struck.
""There's no roof. We are just drinking water. The little food we had in our home was all damaged after the cyclone,"" said Setara Begum, a mother of two, including a five-month old.
""My children are crying for food. I am helpless. I have no money. There's no hope. I don't know how I will raise my children.""
Beyond the camps, officials were also assessing the damage elsewhere. The chief administrator said 17,500 houses had been destroyed and 35,000 partially damaged in the district.
""After the storm, there's an acute crisis of food, shelter, health services, water and sanitation facilities in the makeshift settlements,"" said Sanjukta Sahany, local head of the International Organization for Migration which coordinates relief in some of the camps.
There were also pockets of damage in the broader community, but no reports of casualties, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said.
Omar Farukh, a community leader in Kutupalong camp - one of several camps for Rohingya in Cox's Bazar - described the misery of those left behind.
""We have passed a difficult time. We had no tin or plastic sheets above our heads, and almost all of us passed the night in the rain,"" Farukh told Reuters by telephone.
""We tried to save our belongings, whatever we have, with pieces of plastic sheet,"" he said before adding agency officials visited the Kutupalong camp to see what was needed.
Al Jazeera’s Tanvir Chowdhury, reporting from Kutupalong camp, said authorities and NGOs were not present in the camp and refugees had to repair the damage themselves.
""They are left on their own,"" he said.

The Syrian refugees, including babies and a pregnant woman in need of medical care, have been stuck on the border since April 17, with Morocco and Algeria trading blame in what resulted in a diplomatic row last month.
""There is a sense of urgency in this matter and we call on both governments to take instant and constructive steps to uphold international humanitarian imperatives and evacuate this vulnerable group,"" the UNHCR said in a statement.
According to Human Rights Watch, the refugees arrived at the border after traveling through Libya and Sudan. The UNHCR said they are in dire circumstances, including exposure to snakes and scorpions in the remote area.
Videos emerged on social media last week showing locals from the border town of Figuig demanding the Moroccan government allow the Syrian refugees in ahead of the holy month of Ramadan, which began last weekend.
Morocco said last month that the Syrians attempted to enter Morocco through Figuig, an area surrounded by mountains, between April 17 and 19. Rabat accused Algeria of forcing them to cross into Morocco.
Algeria rejected the accusations, saying Moroccan officials had tried to dispatch a group of Syrians over the border from Morocco into Algeria.
Some 5,000 Syrians have gone through a migration regulatory process in Morocco, with several hundred receiving refugee status, according to Morocco's ministry of foreign affairs.
The North African neighbours often exchange diplomatic barbs over their 1,500 km land frontier from the Mediterranean Sea to the Sahara Desert. It has been shut since 1994 because of disputes over security.
Morocco and Algeria have had a contentious relationship since independence from France. Border disputes triggered an armed conflict in the 1960s known as the ""Sand War"".
One of their biggest disputes has been over Western Sahara, a former Spanish colony, most of which Morocco claimed in 1975. Algeria supports and hosts the Western Saharan independence movement Polisario, a stance that angers Morocco.

""The whole discussion on the topic of climate was very difficult, not to say very unsatisfactory,"" Merkel said, as the two-day G7 summit of some of the world's wealthiest nations in the seaside town of Taormina, Sicily, drew to a close.
""Here we have a situation of six against one, meaning there is still no sign of whether the US will remain in the Paris accord or not,"" she added.
A final G7 communique on Saturday said that all member countries - except the US - had reaffirmed their ""strong commitment"" to abide by the 2015 Paris climate agreement to rein in greenhouse gas emissions.
READ MORE: Seven things you need to know about the G7 summit
Trump says he will make a final decision on whether the US will stay in the Paris climate agreement next week.
Backing out of the climate accord had been a central plank of Trump's campaign. Trump once proclaimed global warming a Chinese hoax.
But Gary Cohn, Trump's economic adviser, on Friday said the president had told his G7 colleagues that he regarded the environment as important.
""His views are evolving, he came here to learn,"" Cohn said. ""His basis for a decision ultimately will be what's best for the United States.""
The US is the world's biggest carbon emitter after China.
Al Jazeera's Laurence Lee, reporting from Taormina, said the picture that had emerged from the summit was largely of one against six, particularly as the other countries tried to explain their belief in the importance of the Paris accords.
""You sort of get the sense that he doesn't feel comfortable in this group,"" he said.
""It's a bit like what Vladimir Putin was like when Russia was in the G8; [looking] a little bit separate, looking a bit surly and like he doesn't really belong here. [Trump] seemed to be much more comfortable in Saudi Arabia and in Israel,"" said Lee.
Lee said that the US had apparently won some battles at the summit, particularly regarding refugees.
Italy was disappointed not to receive more backing for its call to open up more legal channels for immigration to try to slow the flow of people risking their lives to reach Europe on flimsy boats from lawless Libya.
""That was very much Donald Trump's doing because he said [the US] didn't want to take any more refugees just because the G7 wants to,"" reported Al Jazeera's Lee.
Reuters reported that a European diplomat, who declined to be named, said: ""There was very strong opposition by the Americans and British who wanted to refocus on security and water down the expansive language on freedom of movement.""
The G7 also stated that they are ready if necessary to slap extra sanctions on Russia if it continues failing to honour its commitments on Ukraine, the summit declaration reads.
""Sanctions can be rolled back when Russia meets its commitments. However, we also stand ready to take further restrictive measures in order to increase costs on Russia should its actions so require,"" the final statement read.
The G7, urged on by Japan, also adopted common language against North Korea after a series of missile tests by the nuclear-armed nation. The G7 statement said that North Korea poses an increasing threat of a ""grave nature"" to international peace and security.
The G7 leaders also reached agreement on improving cooperation against terrorism in the wake of the bomb attack on a concert in Manchester on Monday night that left 22 people dead and dozens wounded.
There was relief that Trump agreed to language on trade in the final G7 communique that commits to a rules-based international trade system.
The final declaration pledged to ""fight against protectionism"" while ""standing firm"" against ""unfair"" trade practices.
The issue is sensitive because Trump has questioned free trade policies normally traditionally championed by the G7.
His treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, has said the US reserves the right to be protectionist if trade arrangements are unfair to US companies and workers.
INSIDE STORY: Is Donald Trump against free trade?
The G7 is an informal gathering that meets every year under a rotating chairmanship. Its decisions are not binding as an international treaty would be simply representing the leaders' political commitments.
The final communique was just six pages long, against 32 pages last year, with diplomats saying the leaders wanted a simpler document to help them to reach a wider audience.
The G7 countries are: Canada, France, Italy, Japan, Germany, the US, and the UK. The European Union also attends.

The order follows the launch of a campaign this month by President Pierre Nkurunziza ""to moralise society"" where he urges Burundians to show their love for each other and their country by getting married.
The government has since been pressuring unwed couples across the country to tie the knot.
Terence Ntahiraja, interior ministry spokesman, told the AFP news agency that Burundi was facing a population explosion, which he blamed on ""illegal marriages"", polygamy, bigamy and ""hundreds of schoolgirls getting pregnant"".
READ MORE: Burundi today, after a year of unrest
He said church and state-sanctioned weddings were the solution and were a patriotic duty.
Authorities in the southeastern province of Rutana have ordered that ""persons living in common-law unions"" should be put on a special list by 22 June, while officials in northwestern Bubanza province have demanded unspecified ""sanctions"" against aisle-dodgers.
Pierre, a 27-year-old farmer living with his partner in Ngozi, in Burundi's north, said local officials had threatened him with a 50,000 Burundian franc ($29) fine and said any child born out of wedlock would not be eligible for free education and medical costs.
Pierre said he had not married because he could not afford the bride price demanded by his girlfriend's family.
""She told me she was pregnant. As I am poor, we decided to come together to raise our child,"" he told AFP. ""We thought we would legalise our union as soon as we could afford it.""
That was five years ago and the couple is now onto their third child.
To enact the president's orders, officials have begun organising mass weddings, something one civil society activist opposed as ""a violation of human rights because the state has no right to attack two adults who have decided to live together without being married"".
READ MORE: Wasting away in Burundi
The activist said the forced marriages were part of a ""religious crusade"" led by Nkurunziza and his wife, both fervent, born-again evangelical Christians.
Ntahiraja, the ministry's spokesman, dismissed such arguments saying the government's campaign was within the law.
""We want Burundians to understand that everyone is responsible for his life, we want order in this country,"" he said.
""All this is done within the framework of the patriotic training programme,"" he added, referring to an initiative launched by Nkurunziza in August 2013 to reinforce ""positive traditional values.""
Since 2015, when Nkurunziza ran for a controversial third term, at least 500 people have been killed in political violence while around 400,000 have fled Burundi for refugee camps in neighbouring countries.

The bloc meets annually to discuss a wide range of issues, including global economy, security and energy - and this year will be no exception.
But with four out of seven leaders sitting at the G7 table for the first time, including US President Donald Trump, experts will be looking for signs about potential policy shifts amid growing global challenges.
Trump, in particular, is likely to face peer pressure over his protectionist and climate-sceptic stance, which has put him at odds with some of the other leaders.
What does the G7 stand for, who are they key players and what are the potential bust-ups? Here, we take a look at some of the most important topics surrounding the Taormina gathering.
The Group of Seven (G7) is an informal bloc of industrialised democracies. Its current members make up nearly 50 percent of the world economy, and represent more than 60 percent of net global wealth.
The G7 takes no mandatory decisions, and the meeting is billed as an opportunity to allow leaders to exchange ideas in key issues. A leaders' declaration at the end of summit is not binding in nature.
The presidency, which rotates among member states, is responsible for setting the agenda and arranging logistics.
The G7 no longer represents all of the world's leading economies. A broader club, the Group of 20, or G20, was set up in 1999 and includes other major global players, including China, India, Brazil, South Korea, Australia, South Africa and Turkey.
The first summit, in 1975, was attended by France, Germany, the US, Britain, Japan and Italy. Known at the time as the G6, it started as a forum for non-Communist powers to address pressing economic concerns, including inflation and recession following an OPEC oil embargo.
Canada was invited to join a year later, creating the G7, which became formalised with annual meetings between the heads of the seven governments.
Representatives of the European Union have been additional participants to summits since 1981.
WATCH: Eastern Ukraine - Enduring the suffering of war
Russia was first invited as a guest observer in 1997 as a way to encourage then-President Boris Yeltsin's capitalist reforms, and formally joined a year later. However, it was kicked out in 2014 over the annexation of Crimea.
Four out of seven leaders will take part in the summit for the first time - apart from Trump and his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron, Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni and British Premier Theresa May will also make their debut.
But for Gentiloni and May, the Taormina summit may also be their last, given upcoming elections. Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, also faces the same prospect ahead of a September poll.
The spotlight is expected to fall on Trump, who has so far given mixed and contrarian signals on key global issues, including relations with Russia, the war in Syria and global trade.
This year's gathering is being billed as a key test of how serious the new US administration is about implementing its policy agenda, particularly on climate change and trade - issues the G7 members broadly agreed on until last year.
Trump, who favours ""America First"" trade policies and has previously claimed that the concept of global warming was created by China, is expected face pressure from allies eager to promote free trade and safeguard the landmark Paris climate agreement of 2015.
In March, the US got the G20 to drop its traditional pro-free trade stance, but Trump has postponed a decision on whether to abandon his country's commitments to curbing carbon emissions until after Taormina.
READ MORE: China's Xi pledges to support Paris climate agreement
Germany, the G7 member with the largest trade surplus, and France, which wants to defend the legacy of the Paris Accord, are the countries most likely to disagree with Washington's position.
Trump's economic advisor Gary Cohn said Friday that US compliance with its Paris commitments would be ""crippling"" to economic growth, but added that the president was ""interested to hear what the G7 leaders have to say about climate"".
Stressing that Trump would put economic development first, Cohn also said the US was looking forward to ""robust discussions about what free and open means"".
Several security issues are expected to be part of the G7 discussions, with the conflicts in Syria and Libya topping the agenda.
Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will also use the summit to underscore concerns over neighbouring North Korea, following its recent series of missile tests.
""The issue of North Korea is a grave threat not only to East Asia but also to the world,"" Abe told reporters before leaving Tokyo, urging the G7 to act ""resolutely"".

May, for her part, will lead a discussion on ""terrorism"" in one of Friday's working sessions and is expected to issue a call for G7 countries to put more pressure on internet companies amid growing content regulatory calls in the wake of violent attacks.
The summit kicks of four days after 22 people, including children, were killed in a concert bomb attack in Manchester in northern England.
May is expected to leave a day early because of the bombing.
As summit host, Italy, is expected to focus on papering over differences.
""It won't be an easy discussion,"" Gentiloni said on the eve of the summit. ""Italian presidency will try to ensure it is a useful one, capable of bringing the different positions closer together.""
Italy, a country at the sharp end of Europe-bound flows, with more than 180,000 arrivals last year, also wants to focus G7 attention on migration.
It chose to host the summit in Sicily, where the bulk of Mediterranean refugees are taken after departing from North Africa.
IN PICTURES: From Gambia to Italy - a refugee's perilous journey
Italy wants G7 partners, starting from the US, to commit to the stabilisation of Libya, where most refugees set off from, and steer discussions on the wider issue of fostering Africa's economic development.
The leaders of Tunisia, Ethiopia, Niger, Nigeria and Kenya will join the discussions on Saturday to say what should be done to encourage investment and innovation on their continent.
While, there is no suggestion Russia may be readmitted any time soon, the issue of engagement with Moscow remains on the top of the club's agenda.
Russia, led by President Vladimir Putin, is a key player in several global dossiers, including Syria, North Korea and Libya.
In April, G7 foreign ministers talked tough, but dismissed a British push to threaten Moscow with extra sanctions over its continued support for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.

The Libyan coastguard has rejected the accusations and demanded evidence.
But those at the scene told Al Jazeera that at around noon, as rescue workers from four groups - French NGOs SOS Mediterranee and Doctors Without Borders (MSF), Italian NGO Save the Children and German NGO Jugend Rettet - were trying to save refugees, a speedboat equipped with four machine guns and bearing the emblem of the Libyan coastguard arrived at the scene.
The speedboat approached the rescue operation at high speed, creating large waves that made it difficult for the refugees to board rubber dinghies, the witnesses said.
Shortly after, a series of gunshots could be heard coming from near the dinghies, Laura Garel, a communications officer on the SOS Mediterranee's rescue vessel Aquarius, told Al Jazeera.
When the shooting started, about 70 people jumped into the water from the refugee boats, said the witnesses.
The shots were seemingly aimed at the people on the boats, according to Jonas, a captain aboard the Iuventa, another rescue vessel at the scene operated by Jugend Rettet.
""For us the situation was critical,"" said Jonas. ""We are here to help, but were forced to stand idly by as to avoid getting hit by a bullet ourselves.""
While the the Iuventa crew was unable to determine whether anyone was harmed by the shooting, SOS Mediterranee said there were no casualties or direct injuries.
The aid organisations and refugees said at least two Libyan coastguard officers stole mobile phones and money from passengers.
""When the Libyans pointed their weapons at us, asking us to give them all our money and cell phones and telling us to jump in the water, we did what they said,"" one Gambian survivor told SOS Mediterranee volunteers.
""I was not afraid. I preferred to die at sea than being pushed back and to die in Libya.""
Mathilde Auvillain of SOS Mediterranee in Sicily described the incident as ""confusing"" and said it was the first time the Libyan coastguard - which usually only observes operations - interrupted the group's rescue efforts.
However, in a previous example of how NGO operations are interrupted, Sea-Watch said on May 10 that Libya's coastguard intercepted about 300 people on a wooden boat and returned them to Tripoli.
""The Libyan coastguard showed very little regard for the well-being of the people in the boats in distress,"" said Annemarie Loof of MSF.
""Their behaviour was reckless - if not directly threatening - to the people on the boats.""
When the Libyans pointed their weapons at us, asking us to give them all our money and cell phones and telling us to jump in the water, we did what they said. I was not afraid. I preferred to die at sea than being pushed back and to die in Libya
Gambian survivor
The Libyan coastguard denied Tuesday's incident took place, calling the accusations ""illogical"".
Ayob Amr Ghasem, a Libyan navy spokesman, challenged the rescue groups to produce evidence of their claims.
""Why would we have shot at boats if we are the ones that always save them?'' Ghasem was quoted by the Italian ANSA news agency as saying.
Despite the circumstances, more than 1,800 people were rescued, including a two-week old baby.
""The dramatic situation on Tuesday - the sad daily situation in the Mediterranean - shows once again the completely inadequate response to the humanitarian crisis that has cost already tens of thousands of lives,"" co-founder of SOS Mediterranee Sophie Beau said.
""The imperative of maritime search and rescue cannot be left to NGOs alone.""
Libya is the main departure point for refugees hoping to reach Europe by sea.
In March 2016, the Balkan route was permanently shut, trapping tens of thousands of asylum seekers in Greece and slowing Aegean Sea crossings to a trickle.
The route between Libya and Italy remains busy.
Migrants and refugees living in Libya or passing through say they are subject to a range of abuses, with hundreds bought and sold in modern-day slave markets, according to the Switzerland-based International Organization for Migration (IOM).
READ MORE: African migrants traded in Libya's 'slave markets', IOM says
European vessels that intercept refugee boats in international waters are obligated to bring those on board to Europe, according to Judith Sunderland, associate director for Europe at Human Rights Watch.
In Tuesday's incident, two of the refugee boats were directed back to Libya by coastguard officers, according to Iuventa, despite being 14 nautical miles from Libya's coast and thus in international waters.
""Certainly we believe that migration cooperation with Libya is deeply problematic,"" Sunderland said.
""[The EU] should be doing a lot more to get people out of Libya in a safe way and a lawful way so they don't have to risk their lives to do so.""

The two men's world views collided head-on early last year, when Francis was sharply critical of Trump's election campaign pledge to build an impenetrable wall on the Mexican border and his declaration that the United States should turn away Muslim immigrants and refugees.
READ MORE: Pope offers strong words of support to immigrants in US
""A person who thinks only about building walls, wherever they may be, and not building bridges, is not Christian,"" Francis said at the time. The pontiff has been a vocal advocate for immigrants and aiding refugees, particularly those fleeing the violence in Syria, deeming it both a ""moral imperative"" and ""Christian duty"" to help.
Trump hit back by calling Francis's comments ""disgraceful"" for doubting his faith. But despite their previous disagreements, Al Jazeera's James Bays, reporting from Rome, said that many expect a ""pretty standard meeting"" between a head of state and the pontiff.
On Wednesday, Trump will be given a tour of the Vatican after he arrives and will then first meet the pope in his library. The two men will then be left alone with a translator to hold a private discussion before emerging again to exchange gifts and farewells.

Trump's visit to the Vatican has met a number of smaller protests. Climate change activists projected the words ""Planet Earth First"" on the massive dome of St. Peter's Basilica at the Vatican on Tuesday night as Trump arrived in Rome.
Protests are also expected on Wednesday in Rome and later in the week when Trump travels to Brussels for a NATO meeting and Sicily for a G7 gathering.
The visit to the Vatican is part of Trump's first foreign trip as US president and comes after stops in Saudi Arabia, Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories.

According to reports by the Jugend Rettet, its crew witnessed shots fired from a ship with Libyan Coast Guard markings in the direction of one raft. A photo posted on Twitter suggests the Libyan Coast Guard boarded one raft and held passengers at gun point.
Jugend Rettet also said several boats were pushed back into Libyan waters, which would represent a violation of the non-refoulement principle. Under this principle of international law, asylum seekers are not to be returned to a country where they face danger of persecution.

""I fully appreciate that the government has security concerns,"" he said, but added that ""other solutions"" could be found for people fleeing countries in conflict such as Syria and Somalia.
Thousands of refugees are being held in dozens of detention centres in Libya, after being stopped or rescued from rickety boats as they attempted the perilous Mediterranean crossing to Europe.
""I was shocked at the harsh conditions in which refugees and migrants are held,"" Grandi said in a statement released on Sunday by the agency's Geneva headquarters.
""Children, women and men who have suffered so much already should not have to endure such hardship.""
The UN refugee agency has secured the release of more than 800 refugees and asylum seekers from Libyan detention centres over the past year and a half, the statement said.
Grandi promised to reinforce his agency's presence in Libya if security conditions allowed it, and also to provide assistance to thousands of Libyans displaced by conflict.
""The time has come for us, as the UN refugee agency, to step up our presence and activities in the country,"" Grandi later told AFP news agency.

US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said that the arms agreements will help Saudi Arabia to deal with ""malign Iranian influence"".
""The package of defence equipment and services supports the long-term security of Saudi Arabia and the entire Gulf region,"" Tillerson told reporters in Riyadh on Saturday.
This is ""in particular in the face of malign Iranian influence and Iranian-related threats which exist on Saudi Arabia's borders on all sides"", Tillerson said.
Al Jazeera's James Bays, reporting from Riyadh, said that the arms deal would be seen by both signatories as a ""win-win"", especially as the deal involved arms that Barack Obama was not prepared to sell to Saudi Arabia, including missile defence systems.
READ MORE: Donald Trump's Middle East visit - What to expect
""I think this is what both sides are trying to project here: a successful meeting and the US relationship with Saudi Arabia returning to the way it was before President Obama,"" said Bays.
""Because certainly the White House says that it feels President Obama 'abandoned' Saudi Arabia and this region, and they want the whole world to know that now they are getting things 'back on track'.""
The Saudi foreign minister Adel al-Jubeir said in the joint news conference with his counterpart Rex Tillerson that the two countries had signed a ""joint strategic vision declaration"" and hailed the talks as a ""truly historic day in the relationship between the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the United States, and we believe the beginning of a turning point in the relationship between the United States and the Arab and Islamic world"".
The arms agreements are part of a series of wider trade deals. Al-Jubeir said ""the total value of those investments is in excess of $380bn"", and claimed the deals would lead to the creation of hundreds of thousands of jobs in the US and Saudi Arabia.
US conglomerate General Electric announced earlier on Saturday that it had also signed agreements and memorandums of understanding worth $15bn.
The deal came at the start of Trump's eight-day foreign tour that will also take him to Jerusalem, the Vatican and meetings with leaders in Europe.
The president and first lady Melania Trump were welcomed by Saudi King Salman as they disembarked at King Khalid International Airport in Riyadh on Saturday morning.
After a welcoming coffee ceremony, Trump and his entourage were brought to the royal court where the president was awarded the Collar of Abdulaziz Al Saud, Saudi Arabia's highest civilian honour.
Trump held talks with King Salman and was to meet the kingdom's two crown princes on Saturday before giving a speech on Islam to leaders of Muslim countries on Sunday.
For Riyadh the visit is an opportunity to rebuild ties with a key ally, strained under Trump's predecessor Barack Obama who Sunni Arab Gulf states suspected of a tilt towards their Shiite regional rival Iran.
Trump's speech on Sunday to dozens of Muslim leaders has been touted as a major event - along the lines of a landmark address to the Islamic world given by Obama in Cairo in 2009.
The speech will be especially sensitive given tensions sparked by the Trump administration's attempted travel ban targeting several Muslim-majority nations and accusations of anti-Islamic rhetoric on the campaign trail.
The next leg of Trump's trip will be Israel. After meeting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem, Trump will see Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas in Bethlehem, part of his efforts to revive the long-stagnant peace process.
INTERACTIVE: A timeline of US-Saudi relations
On Tuesday Trump heads to Rome to meet with Pope Francis. The two men are at odds on everything from climate change to refugee policy, although the pontiff says he will give the US leader an open-minded hearing.
The president will then meet NATO members in Brussels and attend a G7 summit in the Sicilian town of Taormina.

In legislation passed by the Bundestag late on Thursday, German authorities will be able to detain refugees due for deportation for 10 days rather than four, and monitor by ankle bracelet those deemed potentially dangerous.
The legislation also restricts freedom of movement for all failed asylum seekers. It grants the federal refugee agency BAMF and other government bodies more leeway to use and share data retrieved from migrants' mobile phones.
OPINION: Angela Merkel is not the great progressive messiah
Refugee organisation Pro Asyl criticised the measures, saying that they robbed refugees of their right to privacy.
""The agreed package of measures for tougher deportation policies is a programme that will deprive asylum-seekers of hope for protection in Germany and is aimed at discouraging them,"" the organisation said in a statement.
Defending the move, Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere referred to the new measures as ""a conclusion of efforts to tighten asylum laws in this legislative period"".
The measures were decided partly as a response to a truck attack in Berlin in December in which 12 people were killed. Although attacker Anis Amri's asylum request had failed and he was under surveillance by police, the authorities failed to deport him.
Amri, a 24-year-old, had been living in Germany as an asylum seeker. He was killed in Italy after he pulled a gun and shot an Italian officer in the shoulder during a routine police check.
Hundreds of German investigators are investigating how Amri managed to flee Germany after the attack and whether he may have had accomplices or a support network that helped him escape.

In a report released late on Wednesday, the United Nations Children's Fund counted 300,000 unaccompanied and separated children worldwide in 2015 and 2016 - up from 66,000 in 2010 and 2011.
Of the 300,000, some 100,000 were caught trying to cross the border from Mexico to the US, UNICEF said.
Overall, 200,000 applied for asylum in around 80 countries, including 170,000 lone child refugees who applied for asylum in Europe.
""The number is just the tip of the iceberg,"" Justin Forsyth, UNICEF's deputy executive director, said, as many countries outside North America and Europe do not have data on numbers of unaccompanied child refugees.
""One child moving alone is too many, and yet today, there are a staggering number of children doing just that - we as adults are failing to protect them,"" Forsyth said.
The report shows that 92 percent of children and young people who reached Italy by boat between the beginning of 2016 and end of February 2017 travelled alone, compared to 75 percent in 2015.

At a G7 Summit in Italy starting on May 26, UNICEF will encourage world leaders to commit to a six-point agenda to protect refugee and migrant children from exploitation, violence and detention, keeping families together and giving children access to education and healthcare.
The agenda also calls for action on underlying causes of large-scale refugee movement and measures to combat xenophobia and discrimination in countries of transit and destination.
An interviewee in UNICEF's report, Mary, a 17-year-old unaccompanied minor from Nigeria, described her treatment at the hands of a smuggler turned human trafficker. Despite promising to keep her safe, she ended up stuck in Libya for more than three months.
""He said to me if I didn't sleep with him he would not bring me to Europe,"" Mary said in the report. ""He raped me.""
The International Organization for Migration recently said that hundreds of African refugees and migrants passing through Libya have been bought and sold in modern-day slave markets before being held for ransom or used as forced labour or sexual exploitation.
While some of the unaccompanied children are orphans, others are seeking to join relatives who already reached prosperous countries. Other times, relatives believe children ""would have a greater chance of being allowed to stay"" than adult refugees and migrants, the report said.
READ MORE: Greek refugee camps - 'Children grow sicker every day'
UNICEF called on the countries where children have sought refuge to provide better services, saying many ""languish in overcrowded shelters, end up in makeshift camps or are left exposed to the dangers of life on the streets"".
Unaccompanied migrant and refugee children should not be placed in adult detention facilities and ideally should be in foster care, its report said.
In March, Italy's parliament approved a law setting out comprehensive standards of care for unaccompanied migrant children who arrive in the country by sea.
The law includes a strict prohibition on turning unaccompanied minors away at the border and guarantees them access to healthcare.
It also set a 10-day window for officials to confirm migrant children's identities, with the aim of reducing the amount of time they have to spend in preliminary welcome centers.
Among those hailing its passage at the time were UNICEF and the humanitarian group Save the Children.

""We are concerned that these men are being moved to a place with even higher security risks than Manus Island and one that has inadequate facilities to deal with people who require medical treatment,"" said Kate Schuetze, Pacific researcher for Amnesty International.
PNG Immigration officials told asylum seekers on Monday that part of the controversial Manus Island camp, north of the PNG mainland, would close on May 28, with the rest of the compound to shut on June 30, Reuters news agency reported.
PNG officials could not be reached immediately for comment.
The relocation of detainees comes as PNG prepares to close the centre at the end of October when the contract of the camp operator Ferrovial ends.
The centre, which is currently home to more than 800 people, was deemed illegal by PNG's Supreme Court last year.
""The centre won't close drop dead on October 31. They will start to decommission parts of the centre in the run up,"" Peter Dutton, Australia's Immigration Minister, told 3AW radio in the Australian city of Melbourne.

The 700 men found to be genuine refugees have been told that they have the option of temporarily relocating to a transit centre near the town of Lorengau, settling in the PNG community or returning to their countries of origin, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) reported.
Those whose claims have been rejected have been told to return to their countries of origin before the end of August, when a 20,000 Australian dollars ($14,842) cash incentive to return home will cease.
Those held on Manus Island are allowed to travel to Lorengau during the day but nearly all choose to remain in the detention centre amid allegations of assaults and threats against them by residents.
Detainees waiting to be accepted by the US in a refugee resettlement deal, which US President Donald Trump described as ""dumb"", will be settled in a remote area near Lorengau - a major town in the island.
The deal to take asylum seekers from Manus Island and Nauru to the US was reached between the Australian government and the administration of former US President Barack Obama.
Behrouz Boochani, a Kurdish Iranian who has been in detention for four years said via his Twitter account that ""Manus prison is full of tension"".
""I am sure the refugees will resist and they will have to use force. I think there will be a big riot,"" Boochani told ABC.
Funded by Australia, the two remote camps in Nauru and Manus Island were set up in 2013 to detain asylum seekers indefinitely, who arrive by boat.
Under Australia's controversial immigration laws, anyone intercepted while trying to reach the country by boat is sent for processing to these camps. They are never eligible to be resettled in Australia.
Manus Island and Nauru asylum centres have been condemned by human rights groups and the United Nations for cramped conditions, violence and inadequate medical facilities.

Among the victims were six UN peacekeepers, marking the deadliest month for the UN mission MINUSCA since it began in 2014.
The violence represents a new escalation in a conflict that began in 2013 when mainly Muslim Seleka fighters seized power and ousted then-president Francois Bozize, prompting reprisal killings from Christian anti-Balaka militias.
The UN high commissioner for human rights warned on Tuesday the violence in areas previously spared major bloodshed was ""highly worrying"".
""The hard-earned relative calm in [the capital] Bangui and some of the bigger towns in CAR risks being eclipsed by the descent of some rural areas into increasing sectarian violence, with defenceless civilians - as usual - paying the highest price,"" Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein said.
Clashes intensified on Monday in the town of Bria, forcing about 1,000 civilians to seek shelter near the UN base, Secretary-General Antonio Guterres's spokesman, Stephane Dujarric, said on Tuesday.
Medecins Sans Frontieres' (MSF) hospital in Bria received 24 wounded people early on Tuesday as fighting continued, Frederic Lai Manantsoa, MSF's head of mission in the capital Bangui, said.
Casualty counts have been difficult to confirm because of the ongoing violence and remoteness of the locations.
""I don't know exactly how many but some were wounded and others died,"" one Bria resident said.
In a statement, Dujarric said unverifiable figures indicate up to 100 people may have been killed in three days of clashes from May 7-9 in the town of Alindao between anti-Balaka fighters and an ex-Seleka group.
Up to 8,500 people were displaced in the fighting, he said, and the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs plans to lead an inter-agency fact-finding mission there.
Meanwhile, the UN peacekeeper mission said the situation in Bangassou, a town at the border with Democratic Republic of Congo, was ""under control"" after an attack by Christian militiamen at the weekend killed nearly 30 people and forced thousands to flee.
MINUSCA troops captured strategic sites after air strikes on Monday, the mission said. A total of 26 bodies have so far been identified there after fighting.
OPINION: Chasing ghosts in the Central African Republic
""The worst is over,"" the mission's top General Balla Keita told reporters in the capital. ""We are holding the terrain and our men are going to continue search-and-sweep operations.""
According to the UN refugee agency, the violence in Bangassou sent an estimated 2,750 refugees fleeing across the border into Congo over the weekend.
In Bangui, hundreds marched to demand that the perpetrators of attacks face justice after years of impunity.
""We notice, unfortunately, that the violence continues to claim victims,"" said Evodie Ndemade, vice president of a victims' association. ""Justice must be done now.""

The first explosion on Monday went off close to a restaurant, while the second targeted the camp's market nearby.
""There are at least six civilians dead and the number is expected to rise,"" Mohammad Adnan, a rebel official from Jaish Ahrar al-Ashair who runs the policing of the camp, told the Reuters news agency.
There was no immediate claim of responsibility.
In January, a car bomb killed a number of people in the camp, and the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL, also known as ISIS) armed group has since launched attacks on Syrian rebels in the area.
Rukban, near the joint Syria-Iraq-Jordan border, is home to refugees and also to rebel groups, including the Jaish Ahrar al-Ashair, which fight both President Bashar al-Assad and ISIL.
It was also hit by bomb attacks last year.
The car bombs came just hours after air raids hit a Syrian border town in the eastern province of Deir Az Zor and killed at least 30 people, mostly civilians, according to a monitor, which tracks developments on Syria's conflict via a network of contacts on the ground.
The UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said that more than a dozen children were among those killed when the air raids - thought to have been carried out by the US-led coalition - hit residential areas and a mosque in the Abu Kamal town.

The ISIL-linked media outlet Amaq said coalition strikes killed 15 people and wounded 35 others in Abu Kamal.
ISIL holds most of Deir Az Zor province, apart from an enclave at the centre and a nearby air base controlled by Syrian government forces. The province links territory ISIL fighters control in Syria and Iraq.
Since it broke out in March 2011, Syria's conflict has killed hundreds of thousands of people, displaced millions and ravaged the country's economy and infrastructure.
A new round of Syria talks opens in Geneva on Tuesday, overshadowed by a competing process in Kazakhstan's capital, Astana, and with rebels reeling from a major setback in the capital, Damascus.
Efforts to end the war are now proceeding along two rival tracks: the formal political peace process hosted at the United Nations offices in Geneva and parallel talks in Kazakhstan brokered by Russia, Iran and Turkey.
Observers say the UN appears to be scrambling to match Astana's momentum after a landmark deal signed in Kazakhstan on May 4 to create four ""de-escalation"" zones across some of Syria's bloodiest battlegrounds.
UN special envoy Staffan de Mistura told reporters on Monday that the Geneva talks were working ""in tandem"" with the Astana process.
READ MORE: Can the 'de-escalation' plan in Syria work?
Since the Astana deal came into effect a week ago, fighting has slowed across swathes of the country.
But in Damascus, which is not included in the deal, the government has recently secured the evacuation of three rebel-held districts, bringing it closer to exerting full control over the capital for the first time since 2012.
Numerous rounds of UN-backed talks have not produced concrete results, although during the last round in March the sides finally began discussing four separate ""baskets"" of issues: governance, a new constitution, elections and combating ""terrorism"" in the country.

People across historic Palestine - including Israel, the occupied West Bank and the Gaza Strip - held rallies, marches and candlelight vigils on Monday, as well as sounding sirens.
Israel has made publicly commemorating the Nakba increasingly difficult for Palestinians, with a ""Nakba Law"" that authorises Israel's finance minister to revoke funding from institutions that reject Israel's character as a ""Jewish state"" or mark the country's ""Independence Day"" as a day of mourning.
At least 13 Palestinians were injured after Israeli troops fired rubber-coated steel bullets and tear gas at demonstrators outside of the Beit El settlement and military base near Ramallah, according to emergency workers.
READ MORE: How Israel's violent birth destroyed Palestine
Thousands of people in the central West Bank cities of Ramallah and Bethlehem poured into the streets carrying Palestinian flags and keys symbolic of the ""right of return"" for refugees who lost their homes during the Nakba.
Monday also marks the 29th day of a hunger strike launched by 1,500 Palestinian political prisoners in Israeli jails. Prisoners' children are expected to deliver speeches following the march in the West Bank.
Marwan Barghouti, a hunger striker and jailed Palestinian leader, urged Palestinians to engage in civil disobedience on Nakba day.
Barghouti, who has reportedly lost 13 kilograms so far in the course of his hunger strike, vowed to continue until the prisoners' demands were met.
Prisoners are calling for better medical services, installation of a public telephone in all prisons to allow communication with relatives, more visitation rights with family members as well as other improved conditions.
""My son and the other political prisoners are only fighting for freedom. We are people like everyone else; we have mothers, we have colour in our eyes, we love. But unlike other people, we don't have a homeland,"" At a Nakba protest in Ramallah, Mahmoud Ziadeh, father of political prisoner and hunger striker Majd Ziadeh, told Al Jazeera:
""I've been living Nakba every day since I was born. But there's no bigger Nakba than our children's strike,"" a mother of a hunger-striking prisoner said.
Meanwhile, Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat, who participated in the failed Oslo Accords to bring about a two-state solution to the Israeli occupation, has demanded an Israeli apology over the expulsion of Palestinians in 1948.
""Our nation marking 69 years of the Nakba, our national catastrophe, is symbolised in our exile and the systematic denial of our rights,"" said Erekat in a statement.
READ MORE: Why is Israel afraid of the Nakba's March of Return?
Palestinian refugees of the Nakba and their descendants have lived and outside of Palestine since 1948, with millions of them still stateless or languishing in surrounding refugee camps.
Israel has prevented them from returning to their homes. Palestinians have cited UN Resolution 194 that they say preserves their ""Right to Return"" to Palestine.
Generations of Palestinians who remain in Palestine know nothing but a life under military occupation.
""For me, I was born under occupation. I was raised under occupation. I live every day under occupation,"" Palestinian journalist Elyia Gorbia told Al Jazeera at the demonstration in Ramallah.
""It's only getting worse. They are increasing their occupation strategy, the settlements are expanding, and more lands are being confiscated to build settlements. The number of prisoners in jails is also increasing. Daily attacks are increasing,"" she said.

The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said, citing the Iraqi government, that 434,775 people have fled ISIL's last stronghold in Iraq since Iraqi forces launched the western Mosul operation on February 19.
This brings the number of internally displaced people, since the Mosul operation started in October, to a total of 615,150 Iraqis.
According to OCHA, about 30,000 civilians have returned to their homes in western Mosul since the end of April - meaning that the number of internally displaced people from western Mosul stands at 403,490 people.
The UN Refugee Agency, the UNHCR, announced on Tuesday the opening of a new camp in eastern Mosul for citizens displaced from the west.
The Hasansham U2 camp has a capacity of 9,000.
In recent months, ISIL, also known as ISIS, has stepped up its attacks in different parts of Iraq, apparently in an effort to distract attention from the ongoing US-backed campaign to remove it from Mosul in northern Iraq.
Eastern Mosul was cleared of ISIL fighters in January.
On February 19, Iraqi forces started a major offensive to wrest back the western section of Mosul from ISIL, almost a month after they recaptured the eastern part of the city.
The western side of Mosul is thought to be the most difficult to retake in the ongoing campaign because of the high population density there.
ISIL seized Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city, in a blitz in mid-2014.
READ MORE: Mosul civilians - 'Who knows who was shooting?'
As hundreds of thousands of civilians are still in Mosul, anti-ISIL forces have had to limit their use of aerial attacks and artillery in the city.
Nevertheless, hundreds of civilians have been killed by coalition air raids and shelling, as well as in the counterattacks launched by ISIL.
The US-led coalition bombing ISIL positions in Iraq admitted that it carried out air raids in March at a location in west Mosul where officials and residents say scores of civilians were killed.
According to Iraq's authorities, ISIL now controls less than 7 percent of Iraq.

More than a million children have, meanwhile, been internally displaced.
""No refugee crisis today worries me more than South Sudan,"" said Valentin Tapsoba, Africa director for UNHCR.
""That refugee children are becoming the defining face of this emergency is incredibly troubling.""
South Sudan has been riven by a civil conflict since a split between President Salva Kiir and his former deputy, Riek Machar, escalated in December 2013.
Tens of thousands have been killed and 3.5 million displaced.
About 100,000 people are facing a famine and a million are on the brink of famine.
The UN announcements came on the same day that a monitoring group warned a third South Sudanese county is at risk of famine.
The Famine Early Warning Systems Network said starvation is likely to occur in Koch county.
Famine already has been declared in the counties of Leer and Mayendit, with a million people said to be at risk.
The new report says famine is likely to spread during the lean season for farmers from July to September. It says that without humanitarian aid, famine could be declared in even more areas.

Data released by the polling company Ipsos shows 43 percent of French citizens voted for Macron out of opposition to his far-right rival and just 24 percent did so because they support his policies or personality.
Many of the voters Al Jazeera spoke to on the streets of France, especially younger voters, said they opposed his economic reforms, which they described as “neo-liberal”.
In the run-up to the vote and in its aftermath media outlets have described him varyingly as liberal, centrist, progressive, and even centre-left.
So what does that mean in terms of actual policies, and why do many on the left oppose his platform?
FRENCH ELECTIONS 2017: Who is Emmanuel Macron?
The man Macron replaces as president, Francois Hollande, decided not to stand for re-election because of poor poll ratings, brought on by unpopular austerity policies his government introduced.
As one of Hollande’s key advisers and later his minister for economy, Macron was an integral figure in formulating many of the policy proposals and laws that cost the current president the support of his base.
British newspaper the Financial Times credits his rapid accession to a ministerial role under Hollande to his willingness to attack “leftwing taboos such as France’s 35-hour working week and the wealth tax”.
Macron is in favour of labour reforms that would bring French economic culture in line with those in English-speaking Western countries, such as the US and the UK.
That means reducing the red tape and bureaucracy involved in operating businesses and countering the influence of the country’s powerful trade unions.
Corporation tax would also be cut from the current 33 percent to 25.
The president-elect has promised a huge slimming down of the state budget, pledging to cut more than $65bn of total spending within his term.
READ MORE: Emmanuel Macron's win welcomed by European leaders
A reduction of that scale equals around 120,000 public sector job losses, but Macron does not intend to wield an axe alone.
His cuts come coupled with more than $54bn in a stimulus package which would be spent on training schemes to tackle youth unemployment. At least $16bn of that package would be used to encourage green initiatives.
Economic policy is just one area where Macron would try to force through change.
Macron is a strong supporter of the EU but wants it to implement reforms that would make it more accountable to members of the European parliament.
The former banker wants oversight of the euro currency, which France uses, to be overseen by a specialist eurozone minister, who would answer to elected officials.
On immigration and asylum, Macron supports German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s approach to the refugee crisis and wants France to take in its fair share of refugees.
His platform also emphasises the need to integrate those moving into the country, and his proposals include state-funded language classes for new arrivals.
France has suffered a number of attacks by supporters of groups such as the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) and al-Qaeda. To counter the threat the president-elect wants to recruit 10,000 more police officers.
Macron has proposed the creation of de-radicalisation centres to hold returning ISIL fighters, in an attempt to rehabilitate some of those willing to re-integrate into society.
His proposals also include shutting down places of worship that espouse “jihadist” ideology.
ISIL attacks have led to further deterioration of relations between the French state and the country’s Muslim community, which Macron sets out to address in his manifesto.
The president-elect would like to see fewer imams trained abroad, and instead would push for more Muslim religious leaders to be trained and educated in France.
Macron supports the display of religious clothing in public places, but also supports allowing private companies to make their own rules with regard to religious dress.
A large part of whether Macron can fulfill his vision depends on the support of legislative elections for the National Assembly, due to take place next month.
His En Marche! movement is expected to do well in the vote, but Ipsos puts the number of French citizens who do not want Macron to win a majority at 61 percent.
Support from the assembly will be critical in ensuring Macron can implement his policies and that his tenure does not start with political deadlock.

The agreement is the second phase of an earlier deal to evacuate people from two towns besieged by rebels, and two towns besieged by pro-government forces, the first phase of which was implemented last month.
""Activists in the area told us that green buses arrived in Yarmouk and left carrying dozens of Nusra Front fighters along with their families,"" said Al Jazeera's Hashem Ahelbarra, reporting from Gaziantep along the Turkey-Syria border.
""The operation will continue for some days, and then the Syrian army is expected to take over the part of the camp that was under the control of al-Nusra.""
Most of the nearly 50 fighters were wounded, according to the Beirut-based Hezbollah-affiliated television channel al-Manar.
Hezbollah is a close military ally of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.
Jabhat al-Nusra was the official branch of al-Qaeda in Syria until a year ago when it broke its formal allegiance and renamed itself. It has since joined a number of hardline groups under the new name Hay'et Tahrir al-Sham (commonly referred to as Tahrir al-Sham).
Jabhat al-Nusra and later Tahrir al-Sham have at times fought alongside other rebels, including those that operate under the banner of the Free Syrian Army, against the government and at times have clashed with them.
Yarmouk, in the southern suburbs of Damascus, is the location of a large Palestinian refugee camp. Parts of the area are held by the government, parts by rebels including Tahrir al-Sham, and parts by Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL, also known as ISIS).

The earlier deal involved evacuating civilians from the rebel-besieged Shia-Muslim towns of Kefraya and al-Fouaa in Idlib province in return for the departure of civilians and rebel fighters from the government-besieged areas of Zabadani and Madaya, near Damascus.
Completed late last month, that agreement was the largest and most complex so far in a series of evacuation deals for besieged areas that have grown more common over the past year of Syria's bloody six-year war.
While Assad's government in Damascus has praised such deals as a way to reduce bloodshed, the rebels have condemned them as a means to impose demographic change by forcing large numbers of civilians to leave pro-opposition areas.
The United Nations, which has not been party to the agreements, has also voiced concern that the evacuations amount to forced displacement.
Elsewhere on Sunday, the Syrian army seized control of the village of al-Zalakiyat north of Hama amid heavy bombardment, a war monitor reported, despite a deal brokered by Russia, Syria's main foreign backer, to reduce fighting.
Violence has raged in the countryside north of Hama for more than a month, since rebels there launched an assault against government forces that was quickly reversed and has now turned into an army push into areas the opposition captured last year.
Under an agreement that took effect at midnight on Friday, fighting was intended to subside over six months in four ""de-escalation zones"", where violence between the army and rebels has been most intense.
Fighting also took place on Sunday in the Qaboun district of Damascus, said the Syrian Observatory For Human Rights, a UK-based group that monitors the war via a network of contacts around the country.

The besieged rebel-held enclave of Qaboun is not included in the four de-escalation zones and has been under increasingly heavy bombardment in recent months.
Negotiations were under way on Sunday to evacuate rebels and their families from Qaboun and the adjacent district of Barzeh, an anonymous Syrian military source told AFP news agency.
If the talks are successful, this would be the first time rebels will have been evacuated from Syria's capital since the country's conflict broke out six years ago.
The ""safe zones"" deal was agreed to during ceasefire talks last week in Astana, Kazakhstan, between the Syrian government's backers Russia and Iran, and the main rebel sponsor Turkey.
Syria's government said it supported the proposal but added it would continue to fight what it called ""terrorist"" groups around the country.
Opposition groups rejected the deal saying ""special zones"" threatened Syria's territorial integrity, that any role for Iran was unacceptable, and that Russia had been unable to get Assad to respect previous ceasefire agreements.
""The opposition is accusing the Syrian government of using siege and starvation to force people out of their own areas,"" Al Jazeera's Ahelbarra said.
""They also say the government has managed, over the last few months, to forcibly displace thousands of people from Hama, Homs, Aleppo and from Damascus. They're concerned if this continues, the government could further move towards Idlib and do the same thing.""

Antonio Guterres, the UN chief, issued a call to action on Tuesday at the aid conference held in Geneva where donor countries pledged almost $1.1bn.
But UN says the amount is half of what is needed to combat what it is calling ""the world's largest hunger crisis"".
More than two million children are acutely malnourished in Yemen. Aid workers say almost half a million of them are suffering from severe acute malnutrition which is a life-threatening condition.
Guterres said that on average, one child under the age of five dies of preventable causes every 10 minutes.
""This means 50 children in Yemen will die during today's conference - and all those deaths could have been prevented,"" he said.
""Our financial situation is bad,"" said Fatema Ali Yahya, mother of a malnourished child.
""Only sometimes we get enough money to buy food. If any of my seven children fall ill, I can't take them to the hospital because we do not have money for medication.""
Yemen was already one of the poorest countries in the region, and the ongoing conflict between the government forces and Houthi fighters has made matters worse.
""As a result for the war, my husband isn't working any more,"" said Um Salem, resident of Yemen's Hodeida.
""He can't go to sea for fishing. All men are jobless. We are suffering from a shortage of food.""
Malnutrition is affecting all vulnerable parts of the Yemeni society, including the disabled and the elderly.
""It's been a year and a half since we're facing difficulties to get enough food for ourselves and our families. We are getting a little bit of food just to survive and sometimes we just stay hungry,"" said Taha al-Nahari, a malnourished Hodeidah resident.
People are also dying of preventable diseases because health services, which used to provide diagnosis and treatment, have collapsed in most parts.
Speaking to Al Jazeera from Sanaa, Shabia Mantoo, a spokesperson for the UN's refugee agency UNHCR, said there will be no end to the humanitarian crisis without a political solution in Yemen.
""The fault and the cause of suffering is the conflict,"" she said.
""That is what is needed to be resolved in order to stop the humanitarian crisis.""

Greece's coastguard said on Monday that the bodies of nine people - six women, two men and a child - had been recovered overnight from Greek waters off the island of Lesbos, while Turkish authorities found the bodies of a further six men and a child in Turkish waters.
Two women from the boat were rescued and several other people were believed to be missing. Several vessels are continuing the search.
The boat was believed to have set sail from Turkey late on Sunday. The alert was raised on Monday morning by a Greek navy vessel that spotted bodies in the water.
Citing survivors, the United Nations refugee agency UNHCR said 25 people were on board. Two survivors, one of whom is pregnant, were from Cameroon and the Democratic Republic of Congo, the agency said.
Hundreds of thousands of people, most of them fleeing the Syrian conflict, have crossed into Greece from the nearby Turkish coast, hoping to head to European countries.
But a European Union-Turkey deal reached last year - in which those arriving on Greek islands face deportation back to Turkey - has significantly reduced the number of people attempting to cross the Aegean.
An average of 20 arrive on Greek islands each day.
Most undertake the short but dangerous journey on overloaded inflatable dinghies or occasionally sailboats.
Lesbos is located fewer than 19km from Turkish shores.

This brings the total number of asylum seekers caught walking across the border to 1,860 so far this year. The new statistics suggest that those numbers could rise further as the weather warms.
Canada is on track to see the highest number of asylum claims in six years, given the pace of claims filed so far, as increasing numbers of people cross into Canada to make refugee claims following US President Donald Trump's election and his crackdown on refugees and migrants.
""The majority of irregular migrants are holders of visas for the United States,"" according to a statement released on Wednesday by the office of Canada's Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale.
""Canadian authorities are managing the increase in asylum seekers in a sound and measured way ... To be clear - trying to slip across the border in an irregular manner is not a 'free' ticket to Canada.""
Canada passes M-103 motion against Islamophobia
Almost three-quarters of the asylum seekers caught crossing so far this year were taken into custody in Quebec, government data showed. Roxham Road, which straddles Champlain, New York and Hemmingford, Quebec, has become such a common spot that photographers cluster there and would-be refugees refer to it by name.
Most of the others were taken into custody in Manitoba and British Columbia - 331 and 201, respectively.
Police said on Wednesday that they have charged 43-year-old Michelle Omoruyi with human smuggling and conspiracy to commit human smuggling.
Police allege they found Omoruyi driving nine West African asylum seekers across the US border into the prairie province of Saskatchewan on Friday night. The nine asylum seekers have filed refugee claims and are not in custody.

Firefighters said at least 10 people had been injured in the blaze at the camp late on Monday, which was home to some 1,500 people, mostly Iraqi Kurds, living in closely packed wooden huts.
""There is nothing left but a heap of ashes,"" Michel Lalande, prefect of France's Nord region, said at the scene as firefighters continued to battle the flames which were visible from several kilometres away.
""It will be impossible to put the huts back where they were before.""
READ MORE: In Dunkirk refugee camp, a life of muddy uncertainty
The camp was being evacuated and the migrants would be rehoused in emergency accommodation, the prefect said.
Al Jazeera's Natacha Butler, reporting from camp, said some 400-600 refugees were housed in three gymnasiums in the Dunkirk suburb of Grande-Synthe, but others had dispersed.
""We've seen them walking along the road; their future was so uncertain but of course it's going to be even more uncertain now.""
The fierce blaze destroyed most of the 300 huts in the camp [AFP]
Lalande said the blaze had been started after a fight on Monday afternoon between Afghans and Kurds at the camp that had left six injured with knife wounds.
""There must have been fires deliberately set in several different places,"" said Olivier Caremelle, chief of staff of Grande-Synthe Mayor Damien Careme, an environmentalist who supported the building of the camp last year.
""It is not possible otherwise. It seems that it is related to fights between Iraqis and Afghans.""
Fights between the refugees continued after midnight, with riot police struggling to contain them and occasionally being pelted with stones, according to an AFP news agency correspondent.
""No one is able to explain how these events could have happened,"" said Lalande.
The population of the Grande-Synthe camp has swelled since the destruction last October of the squalid ""Jungle"" camp near Calais, about 40km away.
READ MORE: Refugee crisis - Cautious welcome to Grande-Synthe camp
According to several witnesses, disagreements arose after an increase in the number of Afghans who arrived from the ""Jungle"" camp.
The Afghans were apparently unhappy at being put up in the communal kitchens while the Kurds slept in chalets.
Their arrival had increased tensions, according to Caremelle.
There have been several violent incidents at the Grande-Synthe camp, with police intervening last month after five men were injured in a fight. Another man was stabbed in November.
French officials had said in mid-March that security forces were planning to start dismantling the camp following clashes at the site.
The camp, built by the humanitarian group MSF (Doctors Without Borders), opened in March 2016 over the objections of the central government.
For more than a decade France's northern coast has been a magnet for refugees and migrants trying to reach Britain, with French authorities repeatedly tearing down camps in the region.
Migrants gather along the northern coast in France seeking to break into trucks heading to Britain or pay people smugglers to help them to get across the Channel.
The issue is a constant source of friction between Britain and France and an embarrassment for the French government, which has been criticised by the UN refugee agency for failing to provide adequate accommodation.

At 19, Yousafzai is the youngest Messenger of Peace, the highest honour given by the UN for an initial period of two years.
She was also the youngest person to win the Nobel peace prize in 2014 when she was 17.
The Pakistani education activist came to prominence when she was shot in the head in 2012 as she was leaving school in Pakistan's Swat valley, northwest of the country's capital, Islamabad.
She was targeted for her campaign against efforts by the Taliban to deny women education.
""You are not only a hero, but you are a very committed and generous person,"" UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres told Yousafzai.
Other current Messengers of Peace include actors Leonardo di Caprio (climate change), Charlize Theron (prevention of HIV and elimination of violence against women), and Michael Douglas (disarmament).
Yousafzai has become a regular speaker on the global stage and visited refugee camps in Rwanda and Kenya last July to highlight the plight of refugee girls from Burundi and Somalia.

In January 2009, Yousafzai began to keep a diary for the BBC’s Urdu service, in which she detailed how she had been affected by the Taliban’s rule, and what life was like for her and her peers under them.
She wrote then under the pen name ""Gul Makai"", the name of the heroine from a local Pashtun folk tale.
Swat valley was under the control of the local chapter of the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) during that time. The TTP-Swat enforced a strict interpretation of Islam in the valley, ruling with an iron fist.
One of its many edicts enforced a complete ban on women’s education.
Yousafzai now lives in the UK, where she received medical treatment following her shooting.

The International Organization for Migration (IOM) said on Tuesday that it had interviewed West African migrants who recounted being traded in garages and car parks in the southern city of Sabha, one of Libya's main people-smuggling centres.
People are bought for between $200 and $500 and are held on average for two to three months, Othman Belbeisi, head of the IOM's Libya mission, said in Geneva.
""Migrants are being sold in the market as a commodity,"" he said. ""Selling human beings is becoming a trend among smugglers as the smuggling networks in Libya are becoming stronger and stronger.""
The refugees and migrants - many from Nigeria, Senegal and The Gambia - are captured as they head north towards Libya's Mediterranean coast, where some try to catch boats for Italy.
Along the way, they are prey to an array of armed groups and people-smuggling networks that often try to extort extra money in exchange for allowing them to continue.

Most of them are used as day labourers in construction or agriculture. Some are paid but others are forced to work for no money.
'HORRIBLE STORIES'
""Over the past few days, I have discussed these stories with several who told me horrible stories.
""They all confirmed the risks of been sold as slaves in squares or garages in Sabha, either by their drivers or by locals who recruit the migrants for daily jobs in town, often in construction, and later, instead of paying them, sell their victims to new buyers.
""Some migrants - mostly Nigerians, Ghanaians and Gambians - are forced to work for the kidnappers/slave traders as guards in the ransom houses or in the 'market' itself.""
IOM Niger staffer
""About women, we heard a lot about bad treatment, rape and being forced into prostitution,"" Belbeisi said.
The IOM said it had spoken to one Senegalese migrant who was held in a Libyan's private house in Sabha with about 100 others, who were beaten as they called their families to ask for money for their captors.
He was then bought by another Libyan, who set a new price for his release.
Some of those who cannot pay their captors are reportedly killed or left to starve to death, the IOM said. When migrants die or are released, others are purchased to replace them.
The agency said migrants are buried without being identified, with families back home uncertain of their fate.
""The situation is dire,"" Mohammed Abdiker, IOM's director of operations and emergencies, who recently returned from a visit to Libya's capital, Tripoli, said in a statement, calling Libya a ""valley of tears"" for many refugees and migrants.
""What we know is that migrants who fall into the hands of smugglers face systematic malnutrition, sexual abuse and even murder,"" he added.
""Last year we learned 14 migrants died in a single month in one of those locations, just from disease and malnutrition. We are hearing about mass graves in the desert.""
To warn potential migrants, the IOM is spreading testimonies of victims through social media and local radio stations.
Libya is the main gateway for people attempting to reach Europe by sea, with more than 150,000 people making the crossing in each of the past three years.
So far this year an estimated 26,886 migrants have crossed to Italy, over 7,000 more than during the same period in 2016.
More than 600 are known to have died at sea, while an unknown number perish during their journey north through the desert.

""We are raising our alarm level further by today warning that the risk of mass deaths from starvation among populations in the Horn of Africa, Yemen and Nigeria is growing.""
Later on Tuesday, speaking to Al Jazeera from Geneva, Edwards said that lives will be lost if help does not arrive.
A preventable humanitarian catastrophe, possibly worse than that of 2011 when 260,000 people died of famine in the Horn of Africa, half of them children, ""is fast becoming an inevitability"", he said.

Violent conflicts and increasing displacement have deepened food shortages in many places, Edwards said, warning that the dangerous combination of factors risked making the current crisis worse than the 2011 drought in the Horn of Africa that killed more than 260,000 people.
""A repeat must be avoided at all costs,"" he said, pointing out that UNHCR's operations in famine-hit northeast Nigeria, South Sudan, Somalia and Yemen were funded at between just 3 and 11 percent.
People are on the run within their countries and there are also greater numbers of South Sudanese refugees fleeing to Sudan and Uganda, according to the UNHCR.

""Always the problem that we have with humanitarian crises in sub-Saharan Africa is that they tend to get overlooked until things are too late,"" Edward said.
UNHCR is expanding its operations but is blocked by a severe funding shortfall, with some of the country programmes only funded at between 3 and 11 percent.
Overall the UN has appealed for $4.4bn for the four countries by the end of April, but has received less than $984m or 21 percent to date, said Jens Laerke, of the UN Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.

UN efforts have repeatedly failed to broker a settlement over the disputed territory, contested since 1975 when the colonial power Spain left, which Polisario says belongs to the Sahrawi people who fought a guerrilla war against Morocco until a 1991 UN-backed ceasefire.
""I intend to propose that the negotiating process be relaunched with a new dynamic and a new spirit,"" Guterres said in his report presented for review to the Security Council on Monday.
""For progress to be made, the negotiations must be open to both parties' proposals and ideas. Algeria and Mauritania, as neighbouring countries, can and should make important contributions to this process.""
A Moroccan foreign ministry source called the UN report more objective in tone than past ones, while a Polisario representative said the Sahrawi movement was ready for talks that were serious and without preconditions.
The UN report said talks must aim for a mutually acceptable political solution over the ultimate status of Western Sahara, including through agreement on ""the nature and form of the exercise of self-determination"".
READ MORE: Making sense of the recent tension in Western Sahara
Last year, Morocco clashed with the UN over its MINURSO peacekeeping mission after former UN chief Ban Ki-moon visited Sahrawi refugee camps in southern Algeria. Rabat kicked out dozens of MINURSO staff from the Western Sahara, saying Ban was biased.
""The tone has clearly changed, and the parameters have taken into consideration a realistic approach that demonstrates the will to protect a certain degree of objectivity,"" the Moroccan foreign ministry source said of the new report, noting also the call for neighbouring countries to participate.
""Everything has its time,"" the source said when asked about whether the report would lead to participation in talks.
Polisario insists on the referendum with independence as an option and says only Morocco and Polisario should be at the negotiating table.
Last year, tensions spiked during a standoff in the remote Guerguerat area. UN peacekeepers stepped in after Moroccan gendarmerie went outside Moroccan-controlled areas in what they said was a road-clearing operation, prompting the mobilisation of Polisario forces.
Morocco in February said that it had withdrawn its troops from the buffer zone, but Polisario says it will remain in the area as a precaution.
Guterres called on the Security Council to ""urge"" the Polisario to ""fully and unconditionally"" withdraw from the Guerguerat buffer strip, noting that the ""risk of an incident or accident remains high"".

The refugee, identified by police as 27-year-old Ali Aamer, had suffered burns covering 85 percent of his body after a March 30 incident in the Vial detention centre in the eastern Greek island of Chios.
Videos posted on social media at the time showed the refugee - who was holding what looked like a fuel container and a lighter - being engulfed by flames, just moments after a tussle with a police officer who had grabbed him from behind in an apparent bid to stop him from setting himself on fire.
The police officer was also injured in the incident, suffering non-life threatening burns on seven percent of his hands and three percent of his face.
Aamer was initially admitted to the island's Skilitseion Hospital and later transported to a specialised unit in the capital, Athens.

He died a week later, on Thursday, police spokesman Theodoros Hronopoulos and a doctor at Athens' Evangelismos hospital confirmed to Al Jazeera.
As of Saturday, his body was still at the hospital's morgue, according to a staff member there.
The incident in Vial took place three days after the apparent suicide of another Syrian refugee in the Greek port of Piraeus, near Athens.
An estimated 62,000 refugees and migrants are currently stranded in mainland Greece and its islands following a wave of European border closures and a controversial deal between the European Union and Turkey in March 2016.
Under the agreement, migrants and refugees arriving in Greece without documents can be deported to Turkey if their asylum applications are rejected. But even if they do qualify for asylum, they face long delays as a result of complex procedures and a huge backlog.
Last month, in a statement marking the deal's one-year anniversary, Save the Children and Doctors Without Borders said refugees stuck in Greek camps - including children as young as nine - are attempting suicide, cutting themselves and using drugs to deal with the ""endless misery"".
The two international charities said anxiety, depression and aggression were on the rise in the camps, stressing that mental health was ""rapidly deteriorating due to the conditions created"" as a result of the EU-Turkey deal.
""Difficult living conditions coupled with uncertainty [about the future] have become a serious psychological burden for a number of refugees and migrants,"" Roland Schoenbauer, spokesman for the United Nations' refugee agency in Greece, told Al Jazeera.
Still, access to vital mental healthcare and support in Greece - where an ailing health system is drastically overburdened after years of deepening recession - is limited.
""The authorities should transfer people as fast as possible to decent accommodation on the mainland, and improve provisions for much-needed mental health services and psychosocial support,"" Eva Cosse, Greece specialist at Human Rights Watch, told Al Jazeera.
""The European Commission should also ensure that the allocated aid benefits all refugees without discrimination, including people with psychosocial disabilities.""

A statement from the UNHCR said on Friday that more residents of Pajok town in South Sudan's Equatoria region were hiding in the bush trying to find their way to safety in Uganda.
""People fleeing the recent incident claimed that the town came under an indiscriminate attack by the South Sudan armed forces,"" the statement said.
The crisis comes after fighting between government forces and rebels erupted on Monday in Pajok in a previously peaceful part of the country that has seen a surge in conflict in recent months.
""Refugees told the UNHCR team on the ground in Lamwo terrifying stories of violence and abuse against civilians. Many have witnessed their loved ones shot dead or slaughtered like animals,"" Rocco Nuri, UNHCR spokesman, told AFP news agency.
""Families fled in all directions. Those unable to run were reportedly shot dead, including the elderly and people with disabilities.""
A local pastor who fled Pajok on Wednesday, and asked not to be named, said soldiers had entered the town in tanks ""and suddenly we saw shooting and we just had to run"".
Both he and regional Anglican Bishop Oringa Benard reported that about 135 people had been killed; however, it could not be independently verified.
Uganda currently hosts more than 832,000 refugees from South Sudan, including more than 270,000 in the Bidibidi refugee camp, which in eight months has gone from an empty patch of land to the world's biggest refugee camp.
Michael Makuei, South Sudan government spokesman, confirmed its forces had attacked Pajok.
""As you know Pajok has been in the hands of the rebels so what happened was government forces went there and fighting ensued and so the civilian population that has been staying with the rebels had to run away,"" he said.
""I don't know the figure [of those who might have been killed or injured] but in any fighting there must be casualties.""

The UN peacekeeping mission UNMISS said in a statement on Wednesday it had twice been prevented from accessing Pajok.
""The mission has received reports of fighting between SPLA [government] troops and the opposition there and is trying to follow up on reports of civilians killed in the area,"" it said.
UNMISS urged the government to immediately allow it access ""so it can fully implement its mandate, including to protect civilians and report on human rights violations"".

President Donald Trump said on Thursday that he ordered the missile attack to hit the airbase that Syrian government forces used to launch the deadly chemical weapons attack.
Here is his full statement:
My fellow Americans: On Tuesday, Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad launched a horrible chemical weapons attack on innocent civilians.
Using a deadly nerve agent, Assad choked out the lives of helpless men, women and children. It was a slow and brutal death for so many.
Even beautiful babies were cruelly murdered in this very barbaric attack. No child of God should ever suffer such horror.

Tonight, I ordered a targeted military strike on the airfield in Syria from where the chemical attack was launched.
It is in this vital national security interest of the United States to prevent and deter the spread and use of deadly chemical weapons.
There can be no dispute that Syria used banned chemical weapons, violated its obligations under the Chemical Weapons Convention, and ignored the urging of the UN Security Council.
Years of previous attempts at changing Assad's behaviour have all failed, and failed very dramatically. As a result, the refugee crisis continues to deepen and the region continues to destabilise, threatening the United States and its allies.
Tonight, I call on all civilised nations to join us in seeking to end the slaughter and bloodshed in Syria, and also to end terrorism of all kinds and all types.

We ask for God's wisdom as we face the challenge of our very troubled world. We pray for the lives of the wounded and for the souls of those who have passed.

Goodnight. And God bless America and the entire world. Thank you.

Others had their throats slit before their bodies were strung up from door frames. Two children were run down by a car.
These are the testimonies from South Sudanese refugees as hundreds fled into Uganda for a second day on Wednesday following an attack by government forces on the border town of Pajok.
At least 17 people were killed, according to a Reuters news agency tally, while roughly 3,000 refugees crossed into Uganda this week.
Their stories offer a glimpse of the brutality of a three-year civil war ripping apart the world's youngest nation.
Password Okot, 30, a farmer, recounted how he lost two brothers.
Having fled the initial fighting, he crept back to his home in Ywayaa village on Pajok's outskirts to collect his belongings. There he saw government soldiers grab his brother, 35-year-old mechanic Ayela Peter, from a crowd, tie his ankles, slit his throat and sling up his body in a doorway.
""When they saw them slaughtering my brother, people scattered and started running. When they were running, they shot my other brother,"" Okot said at the Ngoromoro border crossing.

The government denies its Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) forces target civilians and said Monday's operation in Pajok, a town of more than 10,000 people 15km north of the Ugandan border, was to flush out rebels.
A military spokesman blamed ""bandits"" for killing civilians.
SPLA deputy spokesman Colonel Santo Domic Chol said his troops had orders to refrain from entering and taking over Pajok. ""What I know is that the bandits are looting and killing the population in Pajok, starting on Friday, Saturday.""
South Sudan, which split away from Sudan in 2011 after decades of conflict, has been mired in civil war since President Salva Kiir sacked his vice president Riek Machar in 2013. Thousands have been killed as the civil war rages into its third year and more than 1.5 million people have fled the country in the past nine months alone.
The United Nations said in December it had evidence of ethnic cleansing by both government forces and rebels, with soldiers showing callous disregard for civilian life.
The Pajok assault is the latest in a string of attacks in the fertile Equatoria region that is emptying towns and villages near the border with Uganda and Democratic Republic of Congo.
Two refugees spoke of the SPLA troops overrunning Pajok's hospital and killing a medical worker.
Omal Koloro, 52, a businessman, said the doctor had tried to prevent SPLA soldiers from entering the compound. Four others at the hospital were also killed, Koloro said.
In another incident, he said children were targeted as they ran across a bridge at the first outbreak of gunfire. ""Two were run over and two they just shot,"" he said.
OPINION: South Sudan: A country captured by armed factions
The Ugandan government and United Nations refugee agency (UNHCR) are scrambling to complete a half-built refugee settlement near Ngomoromo for the latest arrivals, who are living in the bush at the Ugandan border.
""We're trying to work out the best place for them to be accommodated,"" UNHCR spokesman Alvin Gonzaga said. ""We're trying to ready the site but we need the signature of the landowners.""
Even when they reach the relative safety of a settlement camp, many refugees face an agonising wait for loved ones who went missing in the panic two days ago.
The phone signal to Pajok has been cut.
""My mother is still there,"" Okot said. ""We don't know whether she's alive or dead.""

Speaking to foreign media on Friday, Hariri said: ""Today, if you go around most of the host communities, there is huge tension between the Lebanese and the Syrians ... I fear civil unrest.""
The remarks came as the United Nations refugee agency (UNHCR) said in a report that the number of refugees who have fled the civil war in Syria since it broke out in 2011, now exceeds five million.
Refugees from Syria make up about a quarter of Lebanon's population. They mostly live in informal camps across the country, some, in severe poverty.
READ MORE: Lebanon's rubbish crisis fuels green alternatives
The Lebanese government has long rejected the implementation of formal refugee camps, fearing the permanent presence of refugees.
""Some say we should have refugee camps in Lebanon, I say Lebanon has become a big refugee camp,"" Hariri said, pointing out that the influx of Syrian refugees in Lebanon has stretched the country's economic resources.
The prime minister also said he would appeal for foreign financial support to boost the local economy and improve infrastructure during next week's conference on the post-conflict future of Syria, taking place in the Belgian capital, Brussels.
""I am going ... to make sure that the world understands that Lebanon is on the verge of a breaking point,"" he said, adding that the country has been ""extremely lucky in making sure this crisis has not affected host communities, but we have stretched our luck"".
In his bid to increase foreign investment, Hariri's plan to help Lebanon's economic and security situation compels the international community to commit to spending the equivalent of $10,000 to $12,000 a refugee over a span of five to seven years, as opposed to the current level of financial support corresponding to an annual $1,000 to $1,200.
""I think that will make sure that Lebanon is going to stand on its own and the economy will thrive,"" he said.
The Syrian civil war played a role in weakening the Lebanese economy and has raised tensions among various communities inside Lebanon that support different sides of the conflict. However, there has not been an outburst of violence between Syrian refugees and Lebanese host communities thus far.
Georges Ghali, programmes manager at Lebanese human rights organisation ALEF, said the tensions were rooted in factors including misperceptions whereby the Lebanese believe that refugees were being showered in aid and government policies that had made it difficult for them to obtain official residency.
Lebanese officials, citing World Bank figures, say the cumulative cost of the Syrian conflict to Lebanon was $18.15bn to the end of 2015. Lebanon's annual economic growth has slowed to just over one percent from an average of eight percent, prior to the war, they said.
The government is seeking financial support for a programme of public sector-led investment in infrastructure to boost the economy, and to increase the number of Syrians in education.
Hariri said the plan would ""equally benefit Lebanese citizens and displaced Syrians"".
To date, the number of documented Syrian refugees in Lebanon is about 1.1 million, according to the latest figures provided by the UNHCR.
OPINION: Arab summit: Arab leaders oblivious to Arab realities
Al Jazeera's Alan Fisher, reporting from Lebanon's Bekaa Valley, said the actual number of Syrian refugees in Lebanon is much higher than the official figure, with more people flowing into the country in the past few weeks.
According to Fisher, most of the new arrivals have not yet registered with the UN, and shortages of food and water are common.
The total number of Syrian refugees abroad amounted to 4.6 million at the end of 2015, but rose to 4.85 million by the end of last year, according to the agency's figures.
The UNHCR estimated another 6.3 million Syrians have been internally displaced.
A UN-led humanitarian appeal to help Syrian refugees and support host communities has received only six percent of the $4.6bn target needed this year.
Lebanon has also been hosting Palestinian refugees since the 1948 Nakba and exodus, which has displaced more than 700,000 people.
Over the years, the number has since drastically increased, especially after the 1967 exodus, which has forced another 300,000 people to flee from Palestine.
FEATURE: UN struggles to rebuild Palestinian refugee camp
As of 2015, Palestinian refugees remain the largest refugee population in the world, with more than seven million displaced globally. Palestinians in Lebanon and their decedents have since lived in 12 formal refugee camps provided by the UN across the country.
Although figures vary, according to a 2014 report released by UNRWA, there are about 450,000 Palestinian refugees who reside in Lebanon, many of whom live under dire social and economic conditions.

The Kurdish-Iranian refugee was waiting at a bus stop with two friends in Croydon, south London, on Friday, when he was approached by about eight people.
""The suspects asked the victim where he was from and when they established that he was an asylum seeker they chased him and launched a brutal attack,"" Detective Sergeant Kris Blamires said in a statement on Saturday.
""He has sustained serious head and facial injuries as a result of this attack, which included repeated blows to the head by a large group of attackers,"" he added.
The 17-year-old was taken to a London hospital for treatment, while his two friends escaped with minor injuries.
Police appealed for information and witnesses and said they were treating the attack as a hate crime.
No arrests have been made.
The UK has seen a surge in xenophobic attacks following Britain's vote to leave the European Union last year.
Much of the Brexit debate focused on a perceived influx of migrants into Britain from other EU countries - and whether their presence was making it harder for Britons to find work, housing and medical care.
Within days of the June 23 referendum, Polish communities reported a series of incidents, including the distribution of leaflets describing them as ""vermin"" and racist graffiti outside a cultural centre in London.
Police recorded 1,546 racially or religiously aggravated offences in England and Wales in the two weeks before the June 23 referendum, and 2,241 in the two weeks after it, the Home Office said.
The total for July was up 41 percent from the same month a year earlier.
The campaign to leave the EU was criticised for its heavy anti-immigration rhetoric, and the issue of immigration played a big part in the decision to leave the bloc.
Nigel Farage, the then leader of the anti-EU UK Independence Party, unveiled a poster featuring a queue of hundreds of refugees entering Europe with the caption ""Breaking Point"".
The image was roundly condemned by British politicians, including members of Farage's own party, and some activists on social media compared it to propaganda images used by the Nazis.

Abdul, whose full name is not being revealed for security reasons, arrived at the Newark, New Jersey airport on March 13 as part of the Special Immigrant Visa (SIV) programme. Afghans who are in life-threatening danger are eligible for this status.
""Border agents coerced him into signing away his fundamental rights, even though the federal government understood his life was in danger in Afghanistan because of his service to the United States,"" Jeanne LoCicero, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union, said in a statement.
The man and his family had previously been attacked by the Taliban armed group. US immigration authorities are trying to deport him.
Abdul, who holds a sponsorship letter from a retired US Army sergeant, worked as a cashier for five years at a cafeteria next to the US embassy in Afghanistan's capital Kabul until February, shortly before he departed for the United States.
Instead of a warm welcome, Abdul was detained on arrival.
""If they had stamped his passport, he would be a lawful US resident,"" Jason Scott Camilo, an immigration lawyer representing Abdul, told Al Jazeera.
Camilo said the Afghan was initially interrogated for 28 hours by agents from the Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and Immigration and Customs (ICE) agencies.
The lawyer said Abdul was without legal counsel for more than a day. He was held in ""a big waiting room. There's a couple of jail-like cells without beds … He couldn't sleep,"" Camilo said.
Shortly before his scheduled deportation, the International Refugee Assistance Project (IRAP) filed a case on Abdul's behalf, which was denied. It then filed an emergency appeal and a court placed a temporary stay on his deportation pending a review of his case.
Abdul has since passed an initial interview for refugee status and is awaiting a court review in mid-April. However, he remains locked up in the Elizabeth Detention Center, a private facility contracted by ICE.
Betsy Fisher, IRAP's policy director, said Abdul's detention is part of a larger clampdown on the Special Immigrant Visa programme.
In December 2016, then-president Barack Obama signed the National Defense Authorization Act, which only allocated 1,500 more SIV visas. With so few visas available, Fisher explained, interviews for applicants at the US embassy in Kabul ended on March 1.
""There are roughly 10,000 people still waiting for SIVs,"" Fisher told Al Jazeera. ""The fact that applicants are now in indefinite limbo because Congress has failed to provide the number of visas we knew were needed is a disgrace and abandonment of our allies.""
Abdul is the second Afghan SIV recipient to be detained this month. On March 4, a family of five that had been granted approval to move to the US because of their father's work was detained in Los Angeles.
Al Jazeera contacted ICE and CBP for comment, but did not immediately receive a response.

The incident happened around 2pm local time (11:00 GMT) on Thursday inside the Vial detention centre.
Videos posted on social media showed the 29-year-old man - who was holding what looked like a fuel container and a lighter - being engulfed by flames, just moments after a tussle with a police officer who had grabbed him from behind in an apparent bid to stop him from setting himself on fire.
READ MORE: Spurned, hopeless and attacked, refugees' drama goes on
The refugee, who reportedly arrived on Chios last week, sustained burns to 85 percent of his body. He was initially admitted to the island's Skilitseion Hospital and was expected to be air lifted to the capital, Athens, for further treatment.
""His condition is particularly serious, and that is why all procedures have been followed to transfer him to Athens with the first available means,"" Eleni Voutierou, the hospital's acting manager, told Al Jazeera.
The police officer was also injured in the incident, suffering burns on seven percent of his hands and three percent of his face. He was also expected to be transported to an Athens hospital.
The incident comes three days after the apparent suicide of another Syrian refugee in the Greek port of Piraeus, near Athens.
The Greek coastguard on Thursday confirmed to Al Jazeera that the man who had been found hanged on Monday close to a passenger ferry terminal at Greece's biggest port had been identified as a 25-year-old Syrian.
An estimated 62,000 refugees and migrants are currently stranded in mainland Greece and its islands following a wave of European border closures and a controversial deal between the European Union and Turkey in March last year.
READ MORE: Number of Syrian refugees surges in 2017
Under the agreement, migrants and refugees arriving in Greece after March 20, 2016, were to be held in centres on five islands, including Chios, and deported to Turkey if their asylum applications are rejected.
Since then, tensions across Greece have often boiled over as the relocation process moves slowly, is applied inconsistently, and is fraught with particular difficulties, including refugees having to navigate a complex legal asylum system in foreign languages.
Amid the difficult living conditions, the delays and the despair, some attempt to kill themselves and many self-harm, according to rights groups.
""Many asylum seekers and migrants stranded in Greece, and trapped on the islands, have seen their mental health deteriorate due to the conditions in which they live in, and the climate of insecurity about what will happen to them in the future,"" Eva Cosse, Greece specialist at Human Rights Watch, told Al Jazeera.
READ MORE: Refugees attempt suicide by hanging from tree in Greece
Rights groups are also warning that despite large amounts of funds being made available, refugees are still lacking access to much-needed mental healthcare and psychosocial support.
""The authorities should transfer people as fast as possible to decent accommodation on the mainland, and improve provisions for much-needed mental health services and psychosocial support. The European Commission should also ensure that the allocated aid benefits all refugees without discrimination, including people with psychosocial disabilities,"" Cosse said.
Aid agencies and humanitarian workers have long warned of a worrying level of mental health issues, including self harm and depression, among uprooted asylum seekers, particularly in unaccompanied ones, who have risked everything to find a better future.
""Many refugees come from Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria, and have survived human rights abuses, torture or witnessed war crimes which can be traumatising,"" Roland Schoenbauer, spokesman for the United Nations' refugee agency in Greece, told Al Jazeera.

""Many, including some of the economic migrants, arrived in Greece with a dream which has been disrupted in the meantime. Long waiting periods for clarity, for reunion with painfully missed relatives in other European countries, or for relocation have made many people desperate, particularly in those government-run camps that could not be brought up to standard.""
His comments were also echoed by Kuriakos Katsadoros, a psychiatrist with Klimaka, a suicide prevention non-governmental organisation that runs a helpline in Greece.
""Under these conditions, tense situations could lead to such unfortunate incidents [including attempted suicides],"" said Katsadoros, the scientific director of Klimaka's Greek Suicide Prevention Centre.
""And amid such large numbers, there are people who are vulnerable and in need of help - which they often can't find, unfortunately, in Greece,"" he told Al Jazeera. ""They need support, not only from the strained Greek authorities but also from Europe.""

Syrians have poured across their borders since anti-government protests in 2011 spiralled into a full-blown conflict between rebels, government troops, and foreign backers.
The first three months of 2017 saw more than 250,000 additional Syrians register as refugees bringing the total to 5.1 million, the UN's refugee agency UNHCR said on its website, without providing an explanation for the apparent surge.
""It's not about the number, it's about the people,"" said UNHCR spokesman Babar Baloch, noting the conflict had now lasted longer than World War II. ""We're trying to look for understanding, solidarity and humanity.""
Turkey continues to host the highest number of Syrians displaced by the conflict - nearly three million people. It saw an increase of 47,000 more refugees since February, Baloch said.

The five-million milestone came a year to the day after UNHCR asked other countries to start resettling at least 10 percent of the most vulnerable Syrian refugees. So far only 250,000 places have been offered.
""We're asking for more legal pathways for Syrians to travel to other countries so that they don't end up dying in the seas like in the Mediterranean,"" said Baloch.
Al Jazeera's Andrew Simmons, reporting from Geneva, said the ""enormity and colossal suffering"" of the refugees is evident from the UNHCR report.
The total number of Syrian refugees abroad stood at 4.6 million at the end of 2015 and rose to 4.85 million by the end of last year, according to the agency's data.
The agency estimated another 6.3 million people have been internally displaced.
Lebanon has more than one million Syrian refugees, while Jordan has 657,000, with others spread across Iraq, Egypt and other North African countries.
Al Jazeera's Alan Fisher, reporting from Lebanon's Bekaa Valley, said the actual number of Syrian refugees in Lebanon is much higher than the official figure, with more people streaming into the country in the last few weeks.
He said most of the new arrivals have not yet registered with the UN, and shortages of food and water is common.
War-torn Iraq also hosts 233,224 Syrian refugees in the Kurdish north.
Iraq itself has an estimated 3.5 million people internally displaced, according to Al Jazeera's Hoda Abdel Hamid, reporting from east of Mosul.
Hundreds of thousands of Syrians have also fled to Europe, but not all have been granted refugee status.
Syrians have also fled to Europe in large numbers, making 884,461 asylum claims between April 2011 and October 2016. Almost two-thirds of the claims were in Germany and Sweden.
Hundreds of thousands more live in Gulf countries that are not party to the 1951 Refugee Convention, such as Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates, so they are not recorded as refugees.
A UN-led humanitarian appeal to help Syrian refugees and support host communities has received only six percent of the money needed this year - $298mn out of $4.6bn target.

The reported toll, which has not been previously disclosed, is based on Malaysian immigration department data provided to the National Human Rights Commission, which is known by its Malay acronym Suhakam.
Reuters reported on Thursday that documents from the government-funded commission detailed 83 deaths in 2015 and at least 35 in 2016 up to December 20.
More than half of the 118 dead were reportedly from Myanmar, the source for tens of thousands of refugees coming to Malaysia, including Rohingya Muslims escaping persecution by Myanmar's authorities and its majority Buddhist population.
In Pictures: Malaysia's unwanted immigrants
It is unclear whether the death rate is higher than in neighbouring countries. Government officials in Indonesia and Thailand told Reuters they do not disclose such numbers.
The rate is higher than in countries such as the United States, which in the last financial year recorded 10 deaths in its much larger immigration detention system.
Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak has been a harsh critic of the Myanmar government and its de-facto leader Aung San Suu Kyi after a crackdown in October by Myanmar’s security forces led many Rohingya to flee across its borders amid multiple allegations of mass killings and gang rapes by troops.
He has called for foreign intervention to stop the ""genocide"" in Myanmar.
Najib's office did not return calls seeking comment.
""The numbers are too many and are shocking and it calls for the overhaul of the system,"" said Jerald Joseph, one of eight commissioners at Suhakam, which is due to publicly announce the numbers next week in its annual report on human rights issues in Malaysia.
Joseph described conditions at the centres, some of which he had visited, as ""appalling"" and said the deaths should be investigated as a criminal matter.
The illnesses that led to some of the deaths may have been caused or exacerbated by poor sanitation and food, physical abuse and a lack of medical attention, said Joseph, who was speaking on behalf of the commission.
Malaysia’s home ministry, which oversees the immigration department, said it was trying to improve the conditions in the centres but that its budget was constrained.
""I agree there is some overcrowding and the conditions are not ideal. We are always trying to improve the procedures, health conditions and management of these sites. The problem is we hit a budget brick wall,"" deputy home minister Nur Jazlan Mohamed told Reuters.

More than two million Somalis have been displaced since 1991 and the country now faces its third famine in 25 years.
Speaking during the summit, Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta made an appeal to the international community to step in and aid Somalia.
Kenyatta was speaking as he hosted the IGAD summit whose main aim was to find a lasting solution to return Somali refugees back to their home country.
""The security crises and droughts in Somalia have had a particularly pronounced impact on human security. To date, close to 900,000 Somalis have sought refuge in our region,"" Kenyatta said.
""A refugee camp was never meant to be a permanent home, nor is being a refugee a promise of losing your citizenship and your country, for more than two decades, more than 400,000 Somalis have been hosted at the Daadab Refugee Complex,"" the Kenyan leader added asserting that Kenya will not back down from its decision to send Somalia refugees back home by May this year.
He added that even though Kenya and Somalia have decided to open their borders to enhance trade, Dadaab has become a protracted situation, characterised by hopelessness that easily feeds environmental destruction; conflicts between refugees and host communities; insecurity; radicalisation; criminality; and allows terrorist operatives to exploit it for their operational efforts.
""It is for these reasons that the Kenya government made a decision in May last year to close down the Daadab Refugee Complex,"" Kenyatta added.
At the same conference, Mohammed Abdullahi Mohammed, the President of Somalia pleaded with the African leaders and the international community not to force refugees to return back to Somalia noting that the drought and famine affecting Somalia will lead to mass displacement and deaths.
According to a joint communique issued after the meeting, the assembly agreed to facilitate the voluntary return of Somali refugees back home in safety and dignity addressing the root causes of displacement.
The East African leaders also agreed to support Somalia by strengthening its security by discharging the mandate of the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) and reinforcing the capacity of the National Security Forces of Somalia.

The man, who was carrying asylum application papers, was found hanged early on Monday close to a passenger ferry terminal at Greece's biggest port near the capital, Athens, the coastguard said.
A coastguard spokesperson told Al Jazeera that the man had not yet been identified and an autopsy was pending.

Greek media, however, said that the man was a 25-year-old refugee from Syria, citing unnamed sources.
His identity could not be independently verified.
An estimated 62,000 refugees and migrants are currently stranded in mainland Greece and its islands owing to a wave of European border closures and a controversial deal between the European Union and Turkey in March 2016.
Since then, tensions across Greece have often boiled over as the relocation process moves slowly, is applied inconsistently and fraught with particular difficulties, including refugees having to navigate a complex legal asylum system in foreign languages.

Kuriakos Katsadoros, a psychiatrist with Klimaka, a suicide prevention NGO that runs a helpline in Greece, said that people who have risked everything to find a better future are often shouldering a considerable burden of mental health problems.
""Under these conditions, tense situations could lead to such unfortunate incidents,"" said Katsadoros, the scientific director of Klimaka's Greek Suicide Prevention Centre.
""And amid such large numbers, there are people who are vulnerable and in need of help - which they often can't find, unfortunately, in Greece,"" he told Al Jazeera.

The conflict has claimed the lives of more than 10,000 people and pushed the impoverished country to the brink of famine , according to the United Nations.
The gathering on Sunday, which was organised by Houthi rebels, was the biggest event since an Arab coalition led by Saudi Arabia entered the conflict in March 2015 to try to restore the internationally recognised government of President Abd Rabbu Mansour Hadi to power.
Witnesses said that a crowd estimated at more than 100,000 people comprising supporters of the Houthis and former President Ali Abdullah Saleh's General People's Congress (GPC) party pressed into Sabeen Square in central Sanaa.

Many waved the red, white and black national colours and chanted against an air campaign targeting the rebels.
Saleh al-Samad, chairman of a governing ruling council that comprises members of the Houthis and Saleh's GPC, told the crowds that ""the battle is still fierce and the war will not end without a victory for the truth and justice"".
Ex-president Saleh, who had rarely been seen in public since he was forced to step down following months of protests in 2011 against his 30 years in office, made a brief appearance to cheers from supporters as the crowd began to disperse.
Hadi was removed after Houthi forces took control of Sanaa in September 2014.
His forces have regained territory since the intervention began, but the rebels still control Sanaa and ports on the southern coast.
The UN estimates that more than 10,000 people, including nearly 5,000 civilians, have been killed in the fighting, and some 40,000 people have been wounded.
The war has also left the country on the brink of a famine, with millions of people displaced, and an estimated seven million people going hungry , according to a UN report.
In Sanaa, Emma O'Leary of the Norwegian Refugee Council, told Al Jazeera that the needs of the civilians are ""enormous"" and ""difficult to describe"".
""We are doing our best to respond to the crisis, but the reality is that this is an extremely difficult environment for all of us,"" O'Leary said.
""Security issues, such as the air strikes and the ground fighting, as well as bureaucratic constraints"" are a real concern, and that the warring parties must return to the negotiating table, she said.
Several rounds of UN-mediated peace talks in Switzerland and in Kuwait have failed to produce an agreement.
The Houthis and the GPC are demanding an agreement on a new administration comprising all parties to run the country until new elections, while Hadi supporters say that the Houthis must hand over their weapons and quit the cities they have seized since 2014.
Baraa Shiban, Yemen project coordinator for the UK-based human rights group Reprieve, said the conflict showed no signs of ending.
""We have a situation where the Yemeni government has managed to gain some territory ... but that doesn't mean we're in any way or form close to the end of the conflict,"" he told Al Jazeera.
""We're looking maybe at a situation of stalemate, where actually no one is able to totally defeat one another - it looks like the humanitarian situation will only deteriorate even further and we have a peace process that is collapsing day by day.""

Guterres' rebuke was delivered to the country's president, Salva Kiir, on Thursday, mentioning ""a refusal by the leadership to even acknowledge the crisis or to fulfil its responsibilities to end it"".
""There is a strong consensus that South Sudanese leaders need to do more to demonstrate their commitment to the wellbeing of the country's people, who are among the poorest in the world,"" he said.
The UN chief was also sceptical of Kiir's intention to hold a national dialogue, in light of the country's ""systematic curtailment of basic political freedoms, and restrictions on humanitarian access"".

In response, South Sudan's deputy UN ambassador, Joseph Moum Malok, said the government ""takes issue with the accusation"" that it is responsible for the famine in two counties, adding that other parts of the country are affected by drought.
He said the government ""will spare no efforts to help address the situation and calls upon the international community to help address this urgent matter"".
Guterres said greater pressure is needed if there is any hope of the leaders changing their approach, which means ""first and foremost that the region and the Security Council must speak with one voice.
The Security Council is divided over two ways to step up pressure on South Sudan's government-an arms embargo, or sanctions on additional people blocking peace.

Malok warned that an arms embargo and additional sanctions ""would further aggravate the situation and would hit hard the vulnerable groups, as the previous experiences had proved.""
South Sudan's three-year civil war has devastated the country, killed tens of thousands, and contributed to a recently declared famine in two counties.
The war began after a struggle for power between President Kiir and former Vice President Riek Machar. The pair signed a shaky peace deal a year ago, but fighting has continued.
The top monitor of South Sudan's peace deal, former Botswana President Festus Mogae, echoed Guterres' call for a unified approach that includes the African Union and the international community, saying the security, economic and humanitarian situation in the country ""has steadily deteriorated to an unacceptable level"".
""Across the board, there is a heightened sense of alarm over the fact that the situation is slipping out of control,"" Mogae told the council. ""We must now stand together to do something about it.""

Filippo Grandi, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, appealed to the international community on Thursday for assistance saying that with present rates of arrival, the numbers of refugees in Uganda would surpass a million before the middle of 2017.
""We are at a breaking point. Uganda cannot handle Africa's largest refugee crisis alone,"" Grandi told reporters in Kampala.
""The lack of international attention to the suffering of the South Sudanese people is failing some of the most vulnerable people in the world when they most desperately need our help.""
Ruhakana Rugunda, Uganda's Prime Minister, said the surge in refugees had placed ""enormous strain"" on public services and infrastructure, with food and clean water running short.
""We continue to welcome our neighbours in their time of need but we urgently need the international community to assist as the situation is becoming increasingly critical,"" Rugunda said.
The UN says it urgently needs more than $250m to support South Sudanese refugees in Uganda.
Last year, only 33 percent of the $649m needed for South Sudan was funded.
Since July 2016, some 572,000 new arrivals who have poured into Uganda in desperate need of safety, with 172,000 arriving there this year alone.
Babar Baloch, a spokesman for UNHCR, told Al Jazeera that the international community had ""failed"" Uganda as it dealt with ""Africa's largest refugee crisis"".
""Inside South Sudan there is insecurity, food shortages and gross human rights abuses. This is what has prompted these people to flee to Uganda and safety.""

Baloch said Uganda's approach to dealing with refugees had been among the most progressive on the continent, with the government and host community displaying outstanding generosity towards people fleeing war and conflict.
Arriving refugees receive small plots of land in host communities to help support themselves.
""The government is open to welcoming refugees and the host nation is sharing land and resources with the South Sudanese,"" Baloch said.
""But the world is failing the refugee hosts and the world's most vulnerable refugees as well.""
At least 50,000 people have died in South Sudan's civil war, which began in December 2013 as a result of a struggle for power between President Salva Kiir and former Vice President Riek Machar.
The pair signed a shaky peace deal a year ago, but fighting has continued.
An estimated 100,000 people are currently experiencing famine, and according to South Sudan's government and UN agencies, another one million people are on the brink of starvation.

Senator John McCain said the Trump administration is weighing the thorny issue of giving the Kurds heavy arms and a major role in the upcoming battle, which would infuriate key ally Turkey.
""The conundrum is that if you don't use the Kurds, [the battle] takes a lot longer,"" McCain told reporters.
""But if you do, you have an enormous challenge as far as relations with Turkey are concerned, including things like the use of Incirlik,"" he added, referring to the Turkish airbase used heavily by the coalition to hit ISIL targets in northern Syria.

McCain said he met recently with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, and the two spoke about the Kurdish issue.
""There's going to be some tough decisions made here,"" McCain said, adding the Kurds were Erdogan's ""first priority"".
In August, Turkey launched Operation Euphrates Shield inside Syria targeting ISIL and the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), which are dominated by YPG Kurdish fighters that Ankara says are ""terrorists"".
The SDF is the primary ground force encircling Raqqa, which the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL, or ISIS) group views as its capital, and an offensive on the city is only a matter of time.
The Pentagon on Wednesday said it had provided airlift and artillery support for primarily Arab components of the SDF in a battle for Tabqa, a key town near Raqqa.
In a statement put out on social media on Wednesday, the SDF said the US-coalition had air-dropped US and SDF forces near Tabqa, expanding its campaign against ISIL in the area.
Pentagon spokesman Eric Pahon described the operation as a large, high-priority offensive to secure the area around Tabqa and the associated Tabqa Dam on the River Euphrates.
""This is a significant strategic target,"" he said. If successful, the operation would ""basically cut ISIS off"" from the western approaches to Raqqa.

US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis are hosting Iraq's prime minister and diplomats from the coalition partners in a two-day meeting at the state department starting on Wednesday.
Trump has vowed to make the fight against Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL, also known as ISIS) a priority and directed the Pentagon and other agencies in January to submit a plan for defeating the group.

ISIL has been losing ground in both Iraq and Syria, and three separate forces, backed by the United States, Turkey and Russia, are advancing on the group's Syrian stronghold of Raqqa.
The meeting is the first of the international coalition since Iraqi government forces, backed by the US-led international coalition, retook several Iraqi cities, including eastern Mosul, from ISIL last year.
While the armed group is overwhelmingly outnumbered by Iraqi forces, it has been using suicide car bombs and snipers to defend its remaining strongholds.
Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi, who met Trump in Washington on Monday, said he had won assurances of more US support in the war against ISIL.
A White House statement after the meeting said both Trump and Abadi agreed that ""terrorism cannot be defeated by military might alone"". The two leaders also called for deepening commercial ties.
Discussions on Wednesday will also focus on how to help Mosul rebuild and ways to tackle ISIL operations in Libya and elsewhere.
In Syria, the US-led coalition has been working with an alliance of Kurdish and Arab militias. Its current focus is to encircle and ultimately recapture Raqqa - ISIL's main base of operations in Syria.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), a Kurdish-led group of militias backed by the US-led coalition, is fighting to isolate Raqqa before an anticipated assault on the city, which the ISIL group has used as a command node to plan attacks abroad.
In a statement put out on social media on Wednesday, the SDF said the US-coalition has air-dropped US and SDF forces near the town of Tabqa in Raqqa province, expanding its campaign against ISIL in the area.
The operation aims to both capture the strategic area of al-Tabqa, just 45km west of Raqqa, and to curb Syrian government advances in that direction.
""What we’re seeing right now is a race to Raqqa. Which forces are going to try to take on ISIL in that pivotal city? Is it going to by Syrian forces backed by Russia and Iran, or is it going to be US forces?

""This is a significant strategic target,"" he said. If successful, the operation would ""basically cut ISIS off"" from the western approaches to Raqqa.
The head of the YPG militia, the strongest in the SDF, said last week that the offensive to retake Raqqa would begin in early April, but a spokesman for the Pentagon said no decision had yet been made.
Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, who is supported by Russia and Iran, has said he saw scope for cooperation with Trump, although he has dismissed the US-backed military campaign against ISIL in Syria as ""only a few raids"".

The UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said on Wednesday that its contacts had counted at least 33 bodies at the site near the village of al-Mansoura, west of Raqqa.
The group, which monitors Syria's war via a network of contacts on the ground, said it believed the air raid at the school-turned-shelter had been carried out by the US-led coalition fighting ISIL, which stands for Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, and is also known as ISIS.
The air raid early on Tuesday morning was also reported by the activist-run Raqqa is Being Slaughtered Silently group, which said dozens of civilians were dead or still missing after the air raid.
A Pentagon spokesman said on Wednesday that the US-led coalition would ask its ""civilian casualty team"" to investigate the allegations.

The US-led coalition has intensified its aerial campaign against ISIL around Raqqa this month, with numerous civilian casualties reported.
Earlier this month, the coalition said its raids in Syria and Iraq had unintentionally killed at least 220 civilians since 2014. But critics say the number is far higher.
Al Jazeera's Hashem Ahelbarra, reporting from Beirut, said the school in al-Mansoura housed many refugees who had fled the fighting in Raqqa.
""This is an area where the US-led coalition has been launching air strikes to break the defence lines of ISIL in Raqqa,"" he said.

The International Rescue Committee (IRC), Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) and Oxfam said on Thursday that the deal exposed refugees to risk and abuse, and accused Europe of setting a dangerous precedent.
""The EU-Turkey deal is playing roulette with the futures of some of the world's most vulnerable. It has become mission impossible for those who need it most to seek refuge in Europe,"" Panos Navrozidis, the IRC's country director in Greece, said.
In a separate statement on the same day, Save the Children and Doctors Without Borders, known by its French initials MSF, said refugees stuck in Greek camps, including children as young as nine, are cutting themselves, attempting suicide and using drugs to cope with the ""endless misery"".
The NGOs said anxiety, depression and aggression were on the rise in these camps, stressing that mental health was ""rapidly deteriorating due to the conditions created as a result of this deal"".
The EU-Turkey deal came into force on March 20, 2016, after more than a million refugees and refugees from Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan and beyond reached Europe in 2015, crossing over to Greek islands from Turkey.
Under the deal, anyone who crosses into Greece without documents can be deported to Turkey unless they qualify for asylum in Greece. But long asylum procedures and a huge backlog have stranded 14,000 asylum seekers on five Greek islands, double the capacity.
The European Union has hailed the deal as a success for stemming the tide of refugees to Europe through Greece.
An estimated 1.2 million people sought asylum in the EU in 2016, slightly fewer than in the previous year, the bloc's statistics office said on Thursday.

The ruling by US District Judge Derrick Watson on Wednesday prevents the executive order from going into effect on Thursday.
Hawaii argued that the new order will harm its Muslim population, tourism and foreign students. Ismail Elshikh, a plaintiff in the lawsuit, said the ban would prevent his Syrian mother-in-law from visiting.
Watson concluded in his ruling that while the order did not mention Islam by name, ""a reasonable, objective observer ... would conclude that the executive order was issued with a purpose to disfavour a particular religion"".
Speaking at a rally in Nashville, Trump called his revised executive order a ""watered-down version"" of his first.
""I think we ought to go back to the first one and go all the way, which is what I wanted to do in the first place,"" Trump said.
He called the judge's block ""unprecedented judicial overreach"" and said he will take the case ""as far as it needs to go,"" including to the US Supreme Court.
The Hawaii case was one of several that were moving through US courts on Wednesday brought by states' attorneys general and immigrant advocacy groups.
Refugee resettlement agencies suing the government asked a federal judge at a hearing in Maryland to block the ban, arguing it discriminates on the basis of religion and violates the US constitution.
EXPLAINED: How could Hawaii block Trump's travel ban?
The president's executive order, which the administration says is necessary for national security, temporarily bars the entry of most refugees as well as travellers from six Muslim-majority countries.
It replaces a January 27 order that Trump abandoned after it was blocked in court last month.
Government attorneys argued that the replacement was revised substantially to address legal concerns, including the removal of an exemption for religious minorities from the affected countries.
""It doesn't say anything about religion. It doesn't draw any religious distinctions,"" said Jeffrey Wall, who argued for the justice department.
Attorneys for the American Civil Liberties Union and other groups said that Trump's statements on the campaign trail and statements from his advisers since he took office make clear that the intent of the ban is to ban Muslims.
Trump policy adviser Stephen Miller has said the revised order was designed to have ""the same basic policy outcome"" as the first.
The new version of the ban affects fewer people than the initial ban.
It applies only to new visas from Somalia, Iran, Syria, Sudan, Libya and Yemen. It does not apply to travellers who already have visas, or to green-card holders. Iraq, included in the first ban, was excluded.
The next step in the legal battle will be for the Trump administration to take the case to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, which will either uphold or cancel the temporary restraining order.
Courts will look at the intent of the law, not only the words of the executive order, said Danielle McLaughlin, a constitutional law scholar.
""Trump's campaign rhetoric was pivotal in the Hawaii court's decision, as it was in the earlier decisions halting his first travel ban,"" she told Al Jazeera.
""During his campaign, Trump promised a ban on Muslims entering the country. This is discrimination on the basis of religion, which is unconstitutional.""
Besides discriminating against Muslims, the Maryland lawsuit argues that it is against federal law for the government to reduce the number of refugees allowed into the United States this year by more than half, from 110,000 to 50,000.
Attorneys argued that if that aspect of the ban takes effect, 60,000 people would be stranded in war-torn countries with nowhere else to go.
OPINION: How Muslim Ban incites vigilante Islamophobic violence
In Washington state, US District Judge James Robart - who halted the original ban last month - heard arguments in a lawsuit brought by the Northwest Immigrant Rights Project, which is making arguments similar to the American Civil Liberties Union in the Maryland case.
Robart is also overseeing the legal challenge brought by Washington state. Attorney General Bob Ferguson argues that the new order harms residents, universities and businesses, especially tech companies such as Washington state-based Microsoft and Amazon, which rely on foreign workers.
California, Maryland, Massachusetts, New York and Oregon have joined the claim.
Washington and Hawaii say the order also violates the First Amendment, which bars the government from favouring or disfavoring any religion. On that point, they say, the new ban is no different from the old.

The European Court of Justice (ECJ) said it does not constitute ""direct discrimination"" if a firm has an internal rule banning the wearing of ""any political, philosophical or religious sign"".
The court gave a judgment in the cases of two women, in France and Belgium, who were dismissed for refusing to remove hijabs, or the headscarf worn by many Muslim women who feel it is part of their religion.

Critics called the ban a thinly veiled measure targeting Muslims.
""A ban on religious and political symbols feels to me as a disguised ban on the hijab. I cannot think of another symbol that will affect hundreds of thousands of people in Europe ,"" Warda el-Kaddouri told Al Jazeera from Brussels.
""By stating that veiled women can simply take off their hijab, you imply that the empowerment of women to be in control of their own body and to make individual decisions is reserved for white women only.""
Kim Lecoyer, president of Belgium-based Muslim Women Lawyers for Human Rights, told Al Jazeera the ruling legitimised discrimination on the grounds of religion.
""The court could and should have seized the opportunity to put a halt to the multiple discriminations faced by Muslim women and protect their fundamental rights, but they chose not to,"" said Lecoyer.
The wearing of religious symbols, especially the hijab, has become a hot button issue with the rise of nationalist and sometimes overtly anti-Muslim parties across Europe.
Some countries such as Austria are mulling a complete ban on the full-face veil in public, while in France last year local authorities barred women wearing the burkini, the full-body swimsuit, fining those who did.
Manfred Weber, head of the centre-right European People's Party, the biggest in the European Parliament, welcomed the ECJ's ruling as a victory for European values.
""Important ruling by the European Court of Justice: employers have the right to ban the Islamic veil at work. European values must apply in public life,"" Weber said in a tweet.
Al Jazeera's Natacha Butler, reporting from Paris, said Tuesday's ruling is complex.
""The idea behind it is that companies have the freedom to choose whether or not they want to present a so-called neutral image and what they want to do to benefit their business.""
Butler said the court ruled businesses should have the freedom to choose how they operate, and that included choosing whether people would be allowed to wear items such as hijabs or crosses on chains.
""It's going to be very complicated to rule on such cases within each country, because it will come under the jurisdiction of each separate nation in the EU, because there are so many shades of grey what constitutes discrimination against somebody’s religious freedom or not,"" she said.
The ECJ ruled on a case dating to 2003 when Samira Achbita, a Muslim, was employed as a receptionist by G4S security services in Belgium .
At the time, the company had an ""unwritten rule"" that employees should not wear any political, religious or philosophical symbols at work, the ECJ said.
In 2006, Achbita told G4S she wanted to wear a hijab but was told this would not be allowed. The company subsequently introduced a formal ban. Achbita was dismissed and she went to court claiming discrimination.

The ECJ said European Union law does bar discrimination on religious grounds, but G4S's actions were based on treating all employees the same, meaning no one person was singled out for application of the ban.
""Accordingly, such an internal rule does not introduce a difference of treatment that is directly based on religion or belief,"" it said.
However, in a related case in France, the ECJ ruled a customer could not demand that a company employee not wear a hijab when conducting business with them on its behalf.
Design engineer Asma Bougnaoui was employed full-time by Micropole, a private company, in 2008, having been told that wearing the hijab might cause problems with clients.
After a customer complaint, Micropole asked Bougnaoui not to wear the hijab on the grounds that employees should be dressed neutrally.

She was subsequently dismissed and went to court claiming discrimination.
The ECJ said the case turned on whether there was an internal company rule in place applicable to all, as in the G4S instance, or whether the client's demand meant Bougnaoui was treated differently.
The ECJ concluded that Bougnaoui had indeed been treated differently and so the client's demand that she not wear a hijab ""cannot be considered a genuine and determining occupational requirement"".
The ruling comes on the eve of a Dutch election in which Muslim immigration has been a key issue and a bellwether for attitudes towards migration and refugee policies across Europe.

Rebels had controlled the springs of the Wadi Barada valley, northwest of Damascus, since 2012 and faced a major offensive by Syrian government forces and their allies, despite a ceasefire deal. The rebels withdrew at the end of January.
The UN Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Syria on Tuesday said it had found no evidence of deliberate contamination of the water supply or demolition by armed groups, as the Syrian government maintained at the time.

The commission said there were no reports of people suffering water contamination on or before December 23, when the Syrian air force hit Ain al-Fijeh spring with at least two air raids.
""While the presence of armed group fighters at (the) spring constituted a military target, the extensive damage inflicted to the spring had a devastating impact on more than five million civilians in both government and opposition controlled areas who were deprived of regular access to potable water for over one month,"" the commission's report, which based its conclusions on interviews with residents and satellite imagery, as well as publicly available information, said.
""The attack amounts to the war crime of attacking objects indispensable for the survival of the civilian population, and further violated the principle of proportionality in attacks.""
In a separate incident, aircraft - most likely Syrian or Russian - bombed the long-standing headquarters of the Syrian Arab Red Crescent in the town of Idlib, the report, which covered the period between July 21, 2016, and February 28 this year, said.
The commission also documented the use of lethal chlorine gas on multiple occasions by government and pro-government forces, in the suburbs of Damascus and Idlib province.
On January 8, civilians were wounded in Baseemeh village near Damascus when pro-government forces used chlorine munitions. In January and February, the UN investigators documented four additional chlorine attacks in the eastern Ghouta area, which were aimed at frontline fighting positions.
Using such weapons amounts to war crimes and violates the international pact that bans chemical munitions, the report said.
There was no evidence of Russian involvement in chlorine attacks, the report said.

The report came less than two weeks after the commission said that both sides in last year's battle for Syria's Aleppo city committed war crimes, Al Jazeera's Rory Challands, reporting from Kazakhstan's capital, Astana, said.
""That report [March 2] said that the Syrian government had been responsible for numerous war crimes,"" Challands said, citing the dropping of chlorine bombs over Aleppo and the bombing of a UN aid convoy which led to multiple deaths.
""It also put some of the blame on the rebel forces, saying they were guilty of indiscriminate attacks on western Aleppo.""
Meanwhile, the Syrian opposition said it would not attend a third round of Syria talks on Tuesday in Astana, leaving little hope for a breakthrough in ending the six-year conflict.
Osama Abu Zaid, a spokesman for the rebels, said they had taken a final decision not to go to the talks as a result of Russia's failure to end what the opposition says are widespread violations of a Turkish-Russian brokered ceasefire last December.
""Currently, the decision is not to go as a result of Russia continuing its crimes in Syria against civilians and its support of the crimes of the Syrian regime,"" he said, adding that they had informed Turkey, a main backer of the rebels, of their decision.
For its part, the Syrian government blamed Turkey for opposition forces boycotting the Astana meeting.
""Turkey should bear the responsibility for the failure of the opposition to attend Astana 3,"" Syrian government representative Bashar Jaafari said in comments carried by state news agency SANA.

Yanghee Lee, the UN special rapporteur on human rights in Myanmar, told the UN rights council in Geneva on Monday evidence indicated a full purge could be the ultimate goal of the institutional persecution being perpetrated against the Rohingya.
""Conducting a household survey - where those absent may be struck off the list that could be the only legal proof of their status in Myanmar - indicates the government may be trying to expel the Rohingya population from the country altogether,"" she said.
The army launched a bloody crackdown against the Rohingya in October in the northern Rakhine state following attacks by rebels on several border posts.
UN investigators say during the military operation women were gang-raped by soldiers and Rohingya babies were slaughtered.
Lee wants the rights council to establish the UN's highest-level probe, a Commission of Inquiry, to investigate the crackdown, as well as violent episodes in 2012 and 2014.
Myanmar's UN envoy in Geneva U Htin Lynn said at the council on Monday the allegations were unverified and one-sided. He said security operations in Rakhine had stopped and the curfew was eased earlier this month.
""The situation in Rakhine state is very complicated in nature and thus requires complicated answers. It also requires greater understanding by the international community,"" he said.
""Myanmar does not accept the idea of a commission of Inquiry, as we are seriously addressing the allegations nationally.""
The council could set up the commission before its session ends later this month, but key players including the European Union have not yet backed Lee's call because of concern that a damning UN investigation might threaten the country's fragile democracy drive.
Speaking to reporters after her council appearance, Lee said she believed support for an inquiry was tepid, including within the EU.
Countries ""won't say they are not going to support your call, but I do hear ... [countries] say that maybe Aung San Suu Kyi needs more time"", Lee said, referring to the Nobel peace laureate who leads Myanmar's civilian government.
Aung San Suu Kyi's administration, which took charge last year after decades of oppressive military rule, has rejected Lee's bid to set up the investigation and insisted its own national probe can uncover the facts in Rakhine.
Lee conceded a full international probe ""could have a destabilising effect"" - in that it may implicate the military in crimes against humanity - but she insisted it was in the government's interest to get the facts out.
WATCH: The Rakhine crisis (24:57)
She also told the council the government's internal probe had already been proved inadequate.
Representatives from the EU, the Netherlands and Britain all avoided the question of the investigation during Monday's discussion.
Julian Braithwaite, Britain's envoy to the council, said the international community needed to ""engage [Myanmar] without damaging the delicate civilian-military balance"".

The world's youngest nation has been mired in civil war since 2013, when President Salva Kiir fired his deputy Riek Machar, sparking a conflict that has increasingly split the country along ethnic lines.
Last month, the United Nations declared that parts of the country are experiencing famine, the first time the world has faced such a catastrophe in six years.
Nearly half of the population - about 5.5 million people - is expected to lack a reliable source of food by July.
READ MORE: Dying of hunger: What is a famine?
Despite the catastrophe, Juba will now charge $10,000 for foreigners working in a ""professional"" capacity, $2,000 for ""blue collar"" employees and $1,000 for ""casual workers"" from March 1, the labour ministry said in a decree.
Edmund Yakani, executive director of the local charity Community Empowerment for Progress Organizations (CEPO), said the move aimed to reduce the number of humanitarian workers.
""Actually, the work permit is too expensive for humanitarian workers, since over 90 percent of the foreigners seeking to work in South Sudan are humanitarian workers"", he told Reuters news agency.
Aid groups say they often face restrictions in South Sudan. In December, Juba expelled the country director of the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) after security agents held him without charge for more than 24 hours.
The UN defines famine as a situation in which at least a fifth of the households in a region face extreme food shortages, acute malnutrition rates exceed 30 percent, and two or more people in every 10,000 are dying each day.
The fighting has uprooted more than 3 million people. Continuing displacement presents ""heightened risks of prolonged (food) underproduction into 2018,"" the UN said in a report last month.

SWEDEN-BASED ARAL BALKAN, HUMAN RIGHTS ACTIVIST:
""I'm disappointed by this ruling.
Facebook is trying to have it both ways.
Facebook is a private enterprise and it wants us to think that it's a public space.
If it was a public space, like a park, you go to a park and nail some photos to a tree, you have individual responsibility there.
But if posters start showing up at a mall, which is what Facebook is, and they don't take them down, then they are responsible for that. That's a private space by Facebook incorporated and they are directly benefiting, actually, from any content that is shared, in their space, in their shopping mall.
Unfortunately with this ruling, [it's] very sad for the individual who's involved here, who's not getting any justice.
The core problem here is our public spaces are privately owned.""
The image of Anas Modamani , 19, has been repeatedly manipulated to link him to attacks or violent crimes, including a case in which juvenile delinquents set fire to a homeless man in Berlin last Christmas.
Modamani wanted the US social media giant, represented by Facebook Ireland Limited, to stop the spread of such defamatory fake news, which have been shared countless times.
Specifically, he wanted an injunction forcing Facebook to actively identify and remove such posts, rather than wait for users to flag them.
German news agency DPA reported that the court in Wurzburg ruled that Facebook itself had not not made the slanderous posts and therefore could not be forced to abide by a cease and desist order.
Modamani is represented by German lawyer Chan-jo Jun, who has previously launched legal actions against Facebook, demanding it stop the spread of racist hate speech and other content illegal under German law.
""It must become more costly to break the law,"" the lawyer tweeted before the court ruling in the southern German city of Wurzburg.
Al Jazeera interviewed Modamani in February.
Then, he said that the photo had ""changed my life"".

The first false post that Modamani could pinpoint was in March 2016, when his photo was purported to be of Najim Laachraoui, one of the attackers behind the Brussels bombings in March 2016; the false story claimed that Merkel ""took a selfie with a terrorist"".
As months passed and more posts started appearing on Facebook, Modamani began legal proceedings, claiming Facebook had failed to take sufficient action against the defamatory posts he flagged.
""I cried when I saw it,"" said Modamani ""I want to live in peace in Germany. I fled from the war and bloodshed in Syria to live in safety ... I was too afraid to leave my house after I saw what people wrote about me. This is not just my problem. It's a problem of our time.""

Under the new legislation, asylum seekers entering Hungary and those already in the country will be detained or moved to the container camps.
Earlier this year, Prime Minister Viktor Orban said the measure was needed as a response to ""terror"" attacks in Europe, citing the November 2015 attacks in Paris.
IN PICTURES: Refugees stranded on Serbia-Hungary border amid winter
The move reinstates Hungary's practice of detaining asylum applicants, which it suspended in 2013 under pressure from human rights groups.
The UN High Commissioner for Refugees, or UNHCR, immediately criticised the measure.
""This new law violates Hungary's obligations under international and EU laws, and will have a terrible physical and psychological impact on women, children and men who have already greatly suffered,"" the UNHCR said in a statement.
On Tuesday, Orban ordered the reinforcement of fences on the country's southern border.
Work began last week on a second border fence and the right-wing government extended a state of emergency that gave authorities additional powers to secure the borders. Hungary had previously built a fence on its borders with Serbia and Croatia in September 2015.

In October last year, the majority of Hungarians voted against an EU referendum aimed at sharing 160,000 refugees around the 28-member bloc through mandatory quotas.
It has since not accepted any asylum seekers allocated under the scheme.
Hungary granted asylum, or some form of protection, to 425 people out of 29,432 applications in 2016.

The order signed on Monday bans citizens from six majority-Muslims countries from entering the US for 90 days and also halts the country's refugee programme for 120 days.
Major changes compared to the previous order that was blocked by judges are that Iraqis are no longer banned and that people who have already been granted visas will not be turned away. ""The Trump administration has conceded that its original Muslim ban was indefensible. Unfortunately, it has replaced it with a scaled-back version that shares the same fatal flaws,"" said Omar Jadwat, director of the American Civil Liberties Union's Immigrant Rights Project.
""The only way to actually fix the Muslim ban is not to have a Muslim ban,"" Jadwat said in a statement.
Trump's first immigration order, signed on January 27, resulted in more than two dozen legal cases in US courts.
The new version, which will come into effect at midnight on March 16, has removed language that would give priority to religious minorities.
Critics had accused the administration of adding such language to help Christians get into the US while excluding Muslims.
OPINION: How Muslim Ban incites vigilante Islamophobic violence
Presenting the revised order, Attorney General Jeff Sessions said it ""responsibly provides a needed pause so we can carefully review how we scrutinise people coming here from these countries of concern"".
""Three of these nations are state sponsors of terrorism,"" Sessions said, referring to Iran, Sudan and Syria, adding that others had served as ""safe havens"" for fighters.
Noor Zafar, a lawyer at the Centre for Constitutional Rights, New York, told Al Jazeera that the new travel ban is not justified by facts.
QUICK FACTS: What makes Trump's revised travel ban different
""I think this is still a ban designed to keep Muslims out of this country,"" she said. ""If you look at the six countries that are targeted by this ban they're Muslim-majority countries and if you look at the evidence that the administration is offering to support its claim that these countries are places from where 'Islamic radicals' come in, that data is just not borne out of facts.""
There have been zero fatal attacks on US soil since 1975 by nationals from the six countries targeted with the ban, according to an analysis of attacks by the Cato Institute.
Trump's first order led to chaos at airports, protests and international condemnation.
Protesters gathered outside the White House on Monday evening to condemn the new order, calling it anti-Muslim and Islamophobic and saying it does not adhere to American values of welcoming refugees.
Bob Ferguson, the attorney general of Washington state, which succeeded in having the previous ban suspended, said he was ""carefully reviewing"" the new order.
Top Democrats also condemned the Republican's new ban, with party leader Tom Perez saying ""we have a responsibility to fight back"".
Chuck Schumer, leader of the minority Democrats in the Senate, said he expected the revised order to have the same uphill battle in the courts as the original version.
""A watered-down ban is still a ban,"" he said in a statement.
""Despite the administration's changes, this dangerous executive order makes us less safe, not more, it is mean-spirited, and un-American. It must be repealed.""

The New York Immigration Coalition called the revised ban ""a mask for the same old hatred, fear and incompetence.""
""This is just one more example of the president's concerted effort to divide this country and instil panic and fear in immigrant, refugee and Muslim communities,"" said NYIC director Steven Choi.
Human Rights Watch said the changes to the original January 27 order, which fell afoul of the US constitution because it appeared to overtly target Muslims, ""are merely cosmetic"".
""President Trump still seems to believe you can determine who's a terrorist by knowing which country a man, woman or child is from,"" said the group's US immigration researcher Grace Meng.
Rabbi Jack Moline, president of the Interfaith Alliance, said they expect as well to battle the revised order in court.
""Even in its slightly revised form, President Trump's Muslim ban violates constitutional principles and undermines America's standing in the world,"" Moline said.
""We must be clear that discriminating against millions of people on the basis of their religion does nothing to make Americans safer.""

Under the Republican president's order announced on Monday, a 90-day ban on travel to the US will be imposed on citizens of Iran, Libya, Syria, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen.
Travellers holding pre-existing visas would still be allowed entry, according to the new order, which will come into effect at midnight on March 16.
""Green card"" holders - that is, those who have US permanent residence - will not be affected by the order.
Al Jazeera's Alan Fisher, reporting from Washington, DC, said: ""[US officials] have tried to take what was the existing executive order, make it much tighter, and essentially make it bulletproof in the courts.""
OPINION: All international laws Trump's Muslim ban is breaking
In initial reactions, rights groups criticised the new order, with the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) saying that the new ban was a ""scaled-back version that shares the same fatal flaws"".
In a statement, ACLU said: ""The only way to actually fix the Muslim ban is not to have a Muslim ban. Instead, President Trump has recommitted himself to religious discrimination and he can expect continued disapproval from both the courts and the people.""
Unlike the previous ban, the new directive does not include Iraq in its list of countries targeted, following pressure from the Pentagon and state department which had urged the White House to reconsider given Iraq's key role in fighting the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) group.
The new version also removed language that would give priority to religious minorities.
Critics had accused the administration of adding such language to help Christians get into the US while excluding Muslims.
The Iraqi government said the revised order sends a ""positive message"" about the future of bilateral relations as the two countries work to combat ISIL, also known as ISIS.
Saad al-Hadithi, government spokesman, said the decision to revise the ban shows that there is a ""real partnership"" between Washington and Baghdad.
Rex Tillerson, US secretary of state, said that the renewed ban is ""a vital measure for strengthening our national security"".
""With this order, President Trump is exercising his rightful authority to keep our people safe,"" he said.
Attorney General Jeff Sessions said the order ""responsibly provides a needed pause so we can carefully review how we scrutinise people coming here from these countries of concern"".
""Three of these nations are state sponsors of terrorism,"" Sessions said, referring to Iran, Sudan and Syria, adding that others had served as ""safe havens"" for fighters.
Trump's first order, signed on January 27, led to chaos at airports, protests and international condemnation.
That order resulted in more than two dozen legal cases in US courts and was ultimately blocked by the courts.
Many said the order partially fulfilled Trump's campaign promise to ban Muslims from entering the US.
Bob Ferguson, the attorney general of Washington state, which succeeded in having the previous ban suspended, said he was ""carefully reviewing"" the new order.
""There's going to be a very orderly process,"" a senior official from the homeland security department said.
""You should not see any chaos, so to speak, or alleged chaos at airports. There aren't going to be folks stopped tonight from coming into the country because of this executive order.""
Senator Ted Cruz praised the new order, which he described as a ""responsible step of acting to prevent terrorists from infiltrating our refugee programmes"".
""In contrast to the hysteria and mistruths that are still being pushed by the media, President Trump’s executive order implements a four-month pause in refugee admissions so that stronger vetting procedures can be put in place,"" Cruz said.

Peter Roff of Frontiers for Freedom, a right-wing think-tank, also welcomed the revised immigration order.
""Muslims are not banned from America,"" he told Al Jazeera.
""On the contrary, Muslims are welcomed in America, but we are only trying to prevent terrorists from coming in who might be infiltrating our country as refugees.
""ISIS and al-Qaeda terrorists killed more Muslims than Christians and Jews.""
By contrast, leading Democrats condemned the new ban, with the party's new leader saying ""we have a responsibility to fight back"".
Chuck Schumer, leader of the minority Democrats in the Senate, said he expected the revised order to have the same uphill battle in the courts as the original version.
""A watered-down ban is still a ban,"" he said in a statement.
""Despite the administration's changes, this dangerous executive order makes us less safe, not more. It is mean-spirited and un-American. It must be repealed.""
Tom Perez, chair of the Democratic National Committee, said party members have a ""responsibility to fight back"".
""I've seen firsthand the difference we can make when we refuse to accept the hateful, immoral, unconstitutional actions of the Trump administration,"" Perez said.
Senator Dianne Feinstein said the ban ""does not strengthen our national security"".
""Painting more than 150 million people with the same broad brush is contrary to the principle of religious freedom and will do nothing to make us safer,"" she said.

A decree published a day earlier banned gatherings at the site of the former ""jungle"" refugee camp, with the Calais authority saying that they spurred ethnic tensions and conflict between rival groups of refugees.
The order, signed by mayor Natacha Bouchart, said that the safety of residents was under threat as refugees fought with one another after food was distributed at the now-closed camp, according to the Reuters news agency.
Seven aid groups said on Friday that, despite the order, they were still distributing meals.
Francois Guennoc of Auberge des Migrants says the groups have changed meal distribution spots and would do so nightly, if needed, to evade police.
Gael Manzi, who works for local aid association Utopia 56, said: ""You're talking about young people and children. You just can't deprive them of food.""
Andrew Stroehlein, spokesman for Human Rights Watch, tweeted: ""Calais mayor aiming to win heartlessness award?""
The mayor's decree did not expressly bar food distribution, but said it was ""necessary to ban all gatherings"" at the site and block people from entering it.
""It's not a directive against the distribution of meals, but against gatherings, because these lead to law and order issues, as well as security and waste problems,"" Bouchart told the AFP news agency. ""I took this decision to make sure that no permanent base or squat is created around Calais,"" she added.
Last month, NGOs said hundreds of refugee children had been returning to Calais, despite the dismantling of the camp late last year.
Calais has been a magnet for refugees trying to reach Britain for more than a decade, with French authorities repeatedly tearing down camps there.
From Calais, refugees try to break into trucks heading to Britain. Some locals resent their presence.
Several thousand people fleeing war or poverty in the camp last October were sent to accommodation around France, leading to fierce criticism from the far-right National Front party.

Iraq's interior ministry said on Friday that 14,000 people fled the northern Iraqi city on Thursday alone, the largest wave of internally displaced people (IDPs) since a US-backed operation in west Mosul was launched on February 19.
The total number of IDPs who fled western Mosul since the start of the military push has reached 46,000, the ministry said.
The announcement followed a previous statement by the United Nations warning that around 4,000 civilians were fleeing the city, ISIL's last major urban stronghold in Iraq, each day.
Al Jazeera's Stefanie Dekker, reporting from a refugee camp in Khazer, east of Mosul, said that IDPs there cited the ""intensity of coalition air strikes"" as one of the main reasons for leaving their homes.
""People in the camp who just arrived explained how terrifying the situation was on those frontlines,"" she said.
""It's a desperate situation for these people; they are being moved across the country to different areas to be housed.
""Aid agencies are warning that they expect the numbers to rise, particularly because west Mosul is densely populated and the fighting has not even reached those areas.""
IN PICTURES: Hunting down ISIL sleeper cells in Mosul
The quickening exodus comes as the International Committee of the Red Cross said on Friday that seven people were receiving treatment for exposure to chemical agents near Mosul.
""During the past two days, the hospital has admitted five children and two women showing clinical symptoms consistent with an exposure to a blistering chemical agent,"" Robert Mardini, the Red Cross Middle East director, said in a statement, referring to a facility near Mosul.
The symptoms include blisters, redness in the eyes, irritation, vomiting and coughing.
""The use of chemical weapons is absolutely prohibited under international humanitarian law. We are deeply alarmed by what our colleagues have seen, and we strongly condemn any use of chemical weapons, by any party, anywhere,"" Mardini said.
The statement did not specify whether the seven were wounded in one or more attacks, how the chemical weapons were delivered, or who was responsible.
ISIL, which holds the majority of west Mosul, has periodically used rudimentary chemical weapons in the course of its more than two-year war with Iraqi forces.
The push for western Mosul began after the eastern half of the city, which is separated from the ISIL-held west by the River Tigris, was declared ""fully liberated"" in January.
Mosul fell to ISIL in the summer of 2014, along with large expanses of northern and western Iraq.

The Iraqi military believes several thousand fighters, including many who travelled from western countries, are hunkered down in Mosul among the remaining civilian population, which aid agencies estimated to number 750,000 at the start of the latest offensive.

More than 28,000 people have been forced from their homes since a coalition of US-backed Iraqi forces launched an offensive on February 19 to retake the western sector of Mosul, ISIL's last major urban stronghold in Iraq, the UN said.
The Iraqi Ministry of Migration and Displacement put the number at 31,000.
Overall, the total number displaced since the battle for Mosul started in October exceeds 176,000, according to the UN.
Al Jazeera’s Stefanie Dekker, reporting from Erbil in northern Iraq, said the latest figures meant that this was the biggest outflow of civilians since the start of the Mosul push.
""There is no secure humanitarian corridor to get out of the neighbourhoods that have been cleared, but even then there is still crossfire,"" she said.
""They [civilians] are having to make their way over barren land ... just southwest of Mosul. We have seen people walking across land; people in wheelchairs, women with children exhausted and terrified, also leaving relatives behind because they are not sure if the route is secure.""
Some of the displaced were moving from areas already under Iraqi military control, afraid of the ongoing fighting and eager to move to safety.
Others escaped across the frontline, waiting until they saw Iraqi forces in the distance and running towards them with white flags.
Along the way, they faced horrifying scenes.
""There were bodies in the street as we walked, children, pieces of bodies,"" Safana, 23, told the AFP news agency, as she waited in a food distribution queue in the Hamam al-Alil camp.
She said that fighters of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) group had told people to leave her neighbourhood of Maamun in west Mosul.
""They came in the morning and said if we hadn't left by evening they would kill us.""
At the Hamam al-Alil camp, 4,000 tents have been put up to receive arrivals, and more than 14,000 people have already been registered, said administrator Nader Samir.
But he said the camp, which is run by a local NGO with UN support, was struggling with several basic problems.
""Our major need is for medical treatment. We don't have any capacity and we have yet to get a response from the government on our request for help,"" he told AFP.
Caroline Gluck, of the UN refugee agency, told Al Jazeera that people who were unable to flee from the ISIL-controlled areas were living in appalling conditions amid increasing food shortages.
""Families told us that they are running out of food,"" she said from Iraq's capital, Baghdad.
IN PICTURES: Hunting down ISIL sleeper cells in Mosul
""Many are only eating bread and water or tomatoes or water, one meal a day. Not only have food prices skyrocketed, but now there is virtually no food available for sale even if you have money.
""Electricity is barely functioning and water is running out.""
The push for western Mosul began after the eastern half of the city, which is separated from the ISIL-held west by the River Tigris, was declared ""fully liberated"" in January .
Mosul fell to ISIL in the summer of 2014, along with large expanses of northern and western Iraq.
The Iraqi military believes several thousand fighters, including many who travelled from western countries, are hunkered down in Mosul among the remaining civilian population, which aid agencies estimated to number 750,000 at the start of the latest offensive.
The fighters are using suicide car bombers, snipers and booby traps to counter the offensive waged by tens of thousands of Iraqi troops, Kurdish Peshmerga fighters and Iranian-trained Shia paramilitary groups.

ISIL fighters launched a counterattack against advancing US-backed Iraqi forces in western Mosul during an overnight storm.
Explosions and gunfire rang out across the city's southwestern districts in the early hours of Thursday. The fighting eased in the late morning, although a correspondent with the Reuters news agency saw an air strike and rebel mortar fire.
A senior Iraqi officer said ISIL staged its attack on units from the elite counterterrorism forces when the storm hampered air surveillance and on-the-ground visibility.
He said some fighters hid among displaced families to get close to the US-trained troops.

In the report, titled ""A Deadly Journey for Children"", which was released on Tuesday, the UN children's agency said a total of 25,846 children - most of them unaccompanied - crossed from North Africa to Italy using the Mediterranean route in 2016.
For the report, UNICEF researchers interviewed a total of 122 refugees - 82 women and 40 children - who tried to complete the perilous journey.
Three-quarters of the refugee children interviewed said they had experienced violence, harassment or aggression at the hands of adults at some point over the course of their journey.
Approximately one-third indicated they had been abused in Libya. A large majority of these children did not answer when asked who had abused them. A few children said they had been abused by people who appeared to be in uniform or associated with military and other armed forces, and several others said that strangers had victimised them.
Also, nearly half of the 122 women and children interviewed reported sexual abuse during migration - often multiple times and in multiple locations.
READ MORE: The cemetery of unknown refugees from the Mediterranean
Women and children were often arrested at the Libyan border where they experienced abuse, extortion and gender-based violence. Sexual violence was widespread and systemic at crossings and checkpoints.
Men were often threatened or killed if they intervened to prevent sexual violence, and women were often expected to provide sexual services or cash in exchange for crossing the Libyan border.
UNICEF also identified an estimated 34 migrant detention centres in Libya during their research.
The Libyan Government Department for Combating Illegal Migration runs 24 detention centres which currently hold between 4,000 and 7,000 detainees. Armed groups also hold migrants in an unknown number of unofficial detention centres.
""The route is mostly controlled by smugglers, traffickers and other people seeking to prey upon desperate children and women who are simply seeking refuge or a better life.""
Afshan Khan, UNICEF
Children did not receive any preferential treatment and were often placed in cells together with adult detainees, which increased the risk of abuse, according to the UNICEF report. Some observers have also reported abandoned refugee children in detention centres and hospitals.
""The Central Mediterranean from North Africa to Europe is among the world's deadliest and most dangerous migrant routes for children and women,"" said Afshan Khan, UNICEF Regional Director and Special Coordinator for the Refugee and Response Crises in Europe.
""The route is mostly controlled by smugglers, traffickers and other people seeking to prey upon desperate children and women who are simply seeking refuge or a better life. We need safe and legal pathways and safeguards to protect migrating children that keep them safe and keep predators at bay.""
Recent data in a survey of women and child refugees in Libya during late 2016 reveal the appalling level of abuse along the migration route.
At the time of the survey, 256,000 migrants were recorded in Libya, including 30,803 women and 23,102 children - a third of whom were unaccompanied. The real figures, however, are believed to be at least three times higher.
Most children and women indicated that they had paid smugglers at the beginning of their journey, leaving many in debt under ""pay as you go"" arrangements and vulnerable to abuse, abduction and trafficking.
Women and children also reported harsh and overcrowded conditions, including lack of nutritious food and adequate shelter, in Libyan detention centres run by both the government and armed militias.
OPINION: EU should invest in development, not security in Africa
""What came out of this report is quite stark and shocking,"" Sarah Crowe, UNICEF spokesperson for refugee and migrant crisis, told Al Jazeera. ""Testimonies coming from these children are truly surprising and terrifying.
""We have access to some of the detention centres in Libya, but a great majority of migrant children in that country are still in the shadows.""
There is a necessity to highlight what is already happening to these children and also point to acceptable solutions, Crowe said.
""You can't look at Libya as a solution on its own,"" she said. ""Libya, in its current state, can not be the solution to the crisis we are facing. We can not send children back to detention, to this destiny. It is unthinkable.
""We need to work on finding a solution to the root causes of the problem and we need to do more to support children at every step of the way.""

At a joint news conference on Monday in Austria with Sigmar Gabriel, Sebastian Kurz, who is known for his anti-immigration stance, said his government was overspending on refugees in his country.
Austria, a nation of 8.5 million people, became a key transit country for hundreds of thousands of migrants and refugees entering the European Union in 2015, with tens of thousands of people requesting asylum there.
""We don't want to pay hundreds of millions of euros in family support for foreign children a year who don't even live in Austria,"" Kurz said.
READ MORE: Divided Austria votes in rerun of presidential contest
""It is unfair to pay out these sums to the same extent when the costs of living are substantially less elsewhere.""
Kurz has cited the success of the EU-Turkey deal in reducing the influx of migrants from outside Europe as something that can serve as a model for possible EU pacts with Libya and other North African countries.
Gabriel, however, suggested the comparison was flawed, arguing that the chaos and anarchy gripping Libya doomed such an agreement.
""We have a state in Turkey, whatever one's opinion about it is,"" he told reporters. ""Not so in Libya.""

Gabriel also dismissed expectations that Tunisia would be able to host mass concentrations of migrants, warning that could be ""destabilising"" in a North Africa country that is struggling to nurture its fragile democracy.
The news conference came a day after Germany's interior ministry said that in 2016 Germany saw an average of 10 attacks a day against refugees, migrants and their shelters.
More than 2,500 refugees in Germany were attacked last year, according to the ministry, raising fears over the safety of those who have fled war and persecution.
The attacks left at least 560 people injured, including 43 children.

The attacks left at least 560 people injured, including 43 children.
""People who have fled their home country and seek protection in Germany have the right to expect safe shelter,"" the interior ministry said, according to the AFP news agency.

In one case, a German neo-Nazi was sentenced to eight years in jail in February for burning down a sports hall set to house refugees, causing damage worth $3.7m.
In another example that shocked the country one year ago, a crowd of onlookers cheered and applauded as an asylum shelter went up in flames in the country's former communist east.
Ulla Jelpke, an MP for the socialist Die Linke party, blamed anti-migrant violence on proponents of the country's far-right and urged the government to take stronger action.
""We're seeing nearly 10 [criminal] acts a day,"" she told the Funke Mediengruppe, a German regional newspaper group. ""Do people have to die before the right-wing violence is considered a central domestic security problem and makes it to the top of the national policy agenda?""

There were 988 attacks including arson on shelters for refugees and asylum seekers, a similar number to last year. In 2014, there were only 199 such cases.
The sharp rise in hate crimes came after Germany, which hosts the largest refugee population in Europe, took 890,000 asylum seekers in 2015 at the height of Europe's refugee crisis.
Chancellor Angela Merkel's decision to welcome refugees polarised the country and fuelled support for far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party.
The number of arrivals fell sharply in 2016 to 280,000, mainly due to border closures on the Balkan overland route and an EU deal with Turkey to stem the flow.

Yacoub Shaheen, the 23-year-old son of a Syriac Christian carpenter, on Saturday night won the pan-Arab singing competition, defeating a fellow Palestinian and a Yemeni in the finals filmed in Lebanon.
He became the second Palestinian to win the contest after Mohammed Assaf, who was raised in a refugee camp in the Gaza Strip, won Arab Idol against all odds aged 23 in 2013.
Hundreds of people, including the town mayor, gathered in front of a large screen in Bethlehem's Manger Square to watch Shaheen sing in the final of the popular television show.
Al Jazeera's Bernard Smith, reporting from Bethlehem, said: ""Arab Idol is the most watched TV programme across the Middle East and North Africa.""
Supporters celebrated all night after Shaheen won, waving Palestinian flags and emblems of the Christian Syriac church.
His mother, Norma Shaheen, thanked the crowd after public vote results came in.
""Yacoub won with his voice, his education, his good manners, as well as his love for his people, Bethlehem and Palestine,"" she said.
In Beirut, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas recent met Shaheen and fellow finalist Amir Dandan, 25, a Palestinian citizen of Israel descended from the Arabs who remained on their land when Israel was established in 1948.

Dandan's supporters also feted him in his hometown of Majd al-Krum in northern Israel, gathering in a stadium to support the singer who has lived in the United States for several years.
This year, four of the 25 contestants taking part in Arab Idol were Palestinian or Palestinian citizens of Israel, the highest participation for Palestinians in four seasons of the show.
Assaf became a symbol of Palestinian resilience when he won in 2013, inspiring two-time Oscar nominee Hany Abu-Assad to direct a feature film about him.
""Assaf is now one of the biggest stars in the region. Yacoub will now also have to adjust to life as a Palestinian celebrity,"" Al Jazeera's Smith said.

More than 20 million people face starvation in the four countries and action is needed now to avert a humanitarian disaster, Guterres told a news conference at UN headquarters on Wednesday.
""We need $4.4 billion by the end of March to avert a catastrophe,"" he said.
So far, the UN has raised just $90m.
South Sudan on Monday declared a famine in northern Unity State while Fews Net, the famine early warning system, has said that some remote areas of northeast Nigeria are already affected by starvation since late last year.
The four famine alerts are unprecedented in recent decades.
There has only been one famine since 2000, in Somalia. At least 260,000 people died in that disaster - half of them children under the age of five, according to the UN World Food Programme.
The UN children's agency UNICEF this week said almost 1.4 million children acutely malnourished in Nigeria, Somalia, South Sudan and Yemen could die from famine in the coming months.

Of the four famine alerts, only one - Somalia - is caused by drought, while the other three are the result of conflicts, also described as ""man-made food crises"".
""The situation is dire,"" said Guterres.
""Millions of people are barely surviving in the space between malnutrition and death, vulnerable to diseases and outbreaks, forced to kill their animals for food and eat the grain they saved for next year's seeds.""
The appeal for international action came as humanitarian aid groups are already struggling to meet needs in Syria and cope with the global refugee crisis.

Thursday's appointment was announced shortly before Mohamed, also known as Farmajo, departed to Saudi Arabia for his first foreign trip since his election.
""The president has requested Somali citizens to work with the prime minister,"" a statement on state radio website Radio Muqdisho.net said.
Mohamed took office peacefully this month after legislators selected him from 21 possible candidates. A dual US-Somali citizen with a reputation as a technocrat, he has promised to tackle hunger, corruption and violence in Somalia, which has been mired in civil war for a quarter of a century.
Khaire is a dual Norwegian citizen who once worked as a primary school teacher in Norway and also for the Norwegian Refugee Council before joining British energy explorer Soma Oil and Gas.
The new prime minister had resigned from his job as the executive director for Africa, to allow him to take up the job of prime minister, Soma Oil said in a statement on Thursday. He had also given up all his shares in the firm, it added.
His selection is seen by some as a nod to balancing clan interests in the Horn of Africa nation. Khaire is a member of the Hawiye clan, as is former President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud, whom Mohamed defeated in the election earlier this month. Mohamed is with the Darod clan.

The new president, who was inaugurated on Wednesday, has vowed to make security a priority in a country where armed group al-Shabab frequently carries out attacks in the capital, Mogadishu, and elsewhere. On Sunday, a car bomb in the capital killed at least 34.
Al-Shabab earlier this week denounced Mohamed's election, calling him an apostate, and vowed to keep fighting.
Mohamed's trip to Saudi Arabia is viewed as signaling a significant shift in Somalia's regional alliances, according to some analysts.
A government statement said that he would meet Saudi King Salman to discuss strengthening the countries' relationship, security and aid for Somalia's drought.
""Having travelled to Saudi Arabia for his first foreign trip as a president, the new Somali president is breaking the long tradition by Somali leaders who have paid their very first foreign trips to Ethiopia, which is called by many as the Mecca of Somali leaders,"" Mohamed Sheikh Abdi, a Somali political analyst based in Mogadishu, told The Associated Press news agency.
""This indicates that the new president now favours an alliance with Arab countries more than others.""

The 52-year-old man, who belongs to the Franciscan Church of France, allegedly molested four homeless Pakistani boys, aged 14 to 18.
The teenagers, who had been sleeping rough around Thessaloniki's main railway station, told police officials that they accepted to stay at the man's home in January after he had offered to provide them with food and housing.
""When questioned, the children said they suffered repeated and persistent sexual abuse by the man,"" a police spokeswoman told Al Jazeera on Wednesday.
""They say that he took advantage of the fact that they were homeless and without food to sexually abuse them.""
The alleged abuse came to light after the boys fled the man's house and one of them found refuge in a Thessaloniki centre for vulnerable migrants.
There, he revealed the abuse to the centre's staff, who contacted police.
Following a search on Tuesday at the man's house in the Toumba area of the northern city, police seized six hard drives and one USB stick, as well as dozens of tablets that fall under the Greek law on addictive substances.
Police on Wednesday said that the French cleric, who has been living in Greece for 12 years, has been charged with sexual abuse and possession and use of drugs.
Three of the boys are currently staying in centres run by NGOs, while one is living at the Diabata refugee camp, according to police.
More than 62,000 refugees and migrants are currently stranded in Greece owing to a wave of European border closures and a controversial deal between the EU and Turkey in March 2016.
When the borders closed last year, more than 2,500 children, many of whom had not been registered as unaccompanied, were trapped in Greece, according to Lora Pappa, the head of METAdrasi, a charity working with unaccompanied minors in the country.
READ MORE: Spurned, hopeless and attacked, refugees' drama goes on
""Currently, despite the big efforts that have taken place, more than 1,200 children remain trapped outside facilities in very difficult conditions - on the Greeks islands or in camps,"" Pappa told Al Jazeera.
""Sad cases, like the one in Thessaloniki, happen when there is no system of checks in place,"" she said.
For hundreds of vulnerable, unaccompanied minors in Greece, life is full of risk and uncertainty.
Those who officially register with Greek authorities are taken by police. Despite being entitled to protection, they often find themselves facing prolonged arbitrary detention in custody and abusive treatment.
""This is very problematic ... and often forces many of them to lie to authorities about their age to avoid staying in poor and degrading conditions,"" Eva Cosse, Greece specialist at Human Rights Watch, told Al Jazeera.
For these children, alone in a foreign country without a parent or an adult responsible for their care, sexual abuse is just one of the many dangers they face.
""These are children who are entirely unprotected. They sleep rough, lack access to education and are exposed to sexual abuse, human trafficking and black labour,"" Cosse said.
""Greece needs to revise its entire system and services to protect unaccompanied migrant and asylum seeking children.""

They were seized over accusations that they accepted and distributed aid from the Saudi-led coalition that has battled the Houthi rebels since March 2015.
However, the Norwegian Refugee Council said no aid from the coalition was being delivered and a misunderstanding had taken place.

Monday's news comes amid a push by forces loyal to Hadi, who is backed by the Arab coalition, to close in on Hudaida on Yemen's western coast.
Forces loyal to the government took full control of Mokha, south of Hudaida, earlier in February as part of a major offensive to oust the Houthis and their allies from Yemen's southwestern coast.
Yemen's conflict escalated in March 2015 when the Saudi-led coalition began air strikes to help forces loyal to Hadi to take large parts of the country back from the rebels.
UN humanitarian coordinator for Yemen, James McGoldrick, last month said more than 10,000 civilians had been killed since 2015.

Hundreds of social media users turned to Swedish newspapers and the country's official Twitter accounts to check whether an attack had taken place on Friday in the Scandinavian nation.
The @Sweden account, which is run by a different Swede each week, quickly refuted the claim.

A tweet by Carl Bildt, the former Swedish prime minister - ""Sweden? Terror attack? What has he been smoking? Questions abound"" - was retweeted more than 11,000 times.

In undercover footage recorded as part of Al Jazeera's investigation The Lobby, Shai Masot - a senior political officer at the embassy who was forced to quit after the film exposed his attempts to manipulate British politics - is seen boasting of his relationship with Angus Robertson to our undercover reporter ""Robin Harrow"" (alias).
""I had hours and hours with him, like I think nine hours in total of sitting around in the embassy … we had a lot of meetings and he told us a lot of stories,"" Masot told Robin and their companion, Maria Strizzolo, a British civil servant.
""[Robertson's] feeling really close, you know, to the Jewish people,"" Masot explained, adding that the SNP deputy leader ""has a great trip"" to Israel lined up.

Over dinner at a Kensington brasserie, Masot recalled Robertson's story about his German heritage.
Robertson's grandfather, a politician in the Reichstag, was persecuted by the Nazis, Masot said.
After his arrest, Robertson's grandfather had his birth certificate changed to identify him as Jewish, which made him a de facto enemy of the state, Masot added.
He said that Robertson had also told him a story from Scotland's history of a 14th-century manuscript that laid claim to the Scottish nation by declaring that the Scots were in fact one of the lost tribes of Israel.
Strizzolo, who was active with the Conservative Friends of Israel parliamentary group, was clearly won over.
""I actually really like him,"" she said.
""Mmm ... I love Angus,"" Masot replied, apparently keen to let his companions know that Robertson was someone Israel could work with at a political level.
Strizzolo also resigned when The Lobby was first broadcast.
She was filmed plotting alongside Masot to ""take down"" Sir Alan Duncan, Britain's pro-Palestinian deputy foreign secretary.
Duncan has previously shown strong sympathies towards Palestinians who suffered under Israel's illegal occupation.
The SNP, too, has been a long-standing advocate for a Palestinian state.

Many in the party's grassroots draw parallels with their own struggle for an independent Scotland, and decry the British government's policy towards Israel.
In the 2015 general election, the SNP's ranks swelled in Westminster. The party recorded a historic landslide victory in Scotland, winning 56 of 59 seats.
In a separate meeting, Masot told our undercover reporter that he wants grassroots pro-Israel movements to fill a ""vacuum"" in the SNP.
Robertson, along with fellow MPs Kirsten Oswald and Paul Monaghan, made their visit in November at the invitation of the Israeli and Palestinian ambassadors to London.
During the one-week trip, they met with Israeli and Palestinian government officials, Israeli businesses and human rights groups such as B'Tselem and Breaking the Silence.
They also visited the Palestinian Shu'fat refugee camp, UN positions in the occupied Golan Heights and the Holocaust memorial at Yad Vashem on a programme Robertson described as ""extremely balanced"".
OPINION: Israel Lobby - Insidious threats should be feared
An SNP spokesperson told Al Jazeera that while the SNP Westminster Group funded the official trip, Israeli government officials were among those who provided assistance in terms of logistical support and in-country travel.
The Palestinian Authority, the UN and the Council for Arab-British Understanding provided similar assistance, the spokesperson said.
According to parliamentary rules, MPs do not have to declare overseas trips ""wholly"" funded by their own parties, but members must declare any hospitality and travel costs amounting to more than £300 ($375).
The nature and value of this assistance remains unclear.
Speaking to The Jewish Chronicle on his return in November, Robertson praised Israel's success as a ""start-up nation"" and looked forward to the ""huge potential"" for trade and tourism with Scotland.
He also cited Israel's relationship with Jews living in the diaspora as something Scotland could learn from.
But in January, in a meeting with the Palestinian Authority's diplomatic representative to the UK, Manuel Hassassian, Robertson was critical of Israel.
According to a statement from the Palestinian embassy, Robertson said that seeing the facts on the ground had been a ""sobering and depressing experience"".
He also condemned plans by the government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to expand illegal construction in the occupied West Bank.
Robertson added that he believed the term ""settlement"" was inappropriate because ""it is a word that connotes something temporary whereas sadly they have been built and planned to be permanent"".
When The Lobby was broadcast in January, the Israeli embassy in London played down Masot's position, saying he was a ""junior employee"".
However Masot, a former major in the Israeli Navy, was not inexperienced.
At one point, Masot told undercover reporter Robin that he had applied for a job as the ""head of the Foreign Affairs Department of the Intelligence Department in Israel"".
An SNP spokesperson confirmed that Robertson met Masot during meetings with the Israeli ambassador in his capacity as the ""ambassador’s assistant"".
Masot was not among the 20 diplomats and support staff named on the embassy's official list. However, Al Jazeera has learned that Masot was instead granted a visa as one of the embassy's ""technical and administrative staff"".
While most embassies of a similar size usually have around two visas granted for these kind of roles, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office recently confirmed that Israel has 17.
While the British government has been quick to sweep the sensitive, counterintelligence matter under the carpet, the parliament's foreign affairs committee is taking a closer look.
Its chairman, Crispin Blunt, singled out by Masot as a supposed ""Arabist"" during undercover filming, has announced an inquiry into ""the way that foreign states and interested parties seek to influence UK policy"".

The internationally recognised government of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi on Saturday declared February 11 the country's National Day, marking the beginning of the Youth Revolution against Saleh's rule.
A statement issued by the civil service ministry said it had been decided that February 11 would be an official holiday for all state institutions.
However, six years after the start of the uprising, hopes of change in the Arabian Peninsula country have been destroyed by sectarian divisions and a long-running conflict.
""I couldn't have been more proud of the revolution we launched,"" said Afnan Qaid Alyousufi, an activist from Taiz, in western Yemen.
""Freedom is so precious that we have to continue the fight. The reason why instability continues is that because the world has betrayed us.""
On Friday, the UN refugee agency said tens of thousands of people had been displaced by fighting along Yemen's western coastline.
William Spindler, UNHCR spokesperson, said 34,000 people fled their homes after fierce fighting erupted in the port towns of Mokha and Dhubab on the Red Sea.
The majority of the displaced were headed to the outskirts of Taiz, he said.
Yemeni forces, allied with the Hadi government that is backed by a coalition of mostly Gulf states, have recently seized Mokha and plan to push northward.
For his part, the leader of Yemen's Houthi fighters announced on Friday that his forces have built drones and missiles that will be used against the Arab coalition and would target the Saudi capital.
In a speech aired on Al Masirah TV, Abdel Malik al-Houthi offered no evidence or figures for the number of drones and missiles allegedly manufactured by the rebels but the UAE, which is part of the coalition, has recently accused the Iran of providing the Houthis with drones.
The speech also followed a Houthi claim earlier in the week that they targeted Riyadh with missiles.
There was no immediate comment from Saudi Arabia but a week ago, it said a ""suicide gunboat"" belonging to the Houthis rammed into one of its frigates in the Red Sea, killing two crew members.

The UN refugee agency said on Friday that unless rival government and rebel forces agreed to talk, the ongoing flow of refugees within the country and abroad will continue this year.
More than 2.1 million people are internally displaced, the UNHCR said.
READ MORE: UN - South Sudan on brink of ethnic civil war
""With this large-scale displacement, South Sudan is now Africa's largest refugee crisis and the world's third after Syria and Afghanistan - with less attention and chronic levels of underfunding,"" the agency said.
""We are appealing on all parties involved in the conflict for an urgent peaceful resolution of the crisis.""
William Spindler, UNHCR, said that in 2016 alone, an estimated 760,000 fled the country, including 500,000 in the second half of the year when the armed conflict - now in its fourth year - intensified.
More than 60 percent of the refugees are children, many arriving with ""alarming levels of malnutrition"" and suffering trauma, he said.
A political split between President Salva Kiir, an ethnic Dinka, and his former deputy, Riek Machar, escalated into a military conflict in December 2013, leaving tens of thousands of people dead.
A unity government was formed in April 2016, but fighting erupted again in July, sending Machar and his forces into exile.
The UN's top human rights agency has previously blamed both sides for ethnically targeted violations, including extrajudicial executions and sexual violence incidences in August 2015.
There are an estimated 13,500 UN peacekeeping forces in the country. But in January, the government rejected an additional 4,000 troops.
Recent refugees report of suffering inside the country, with many facing threats of kidnappings, rape, armed attacks and ""acute food shortage"", the UNHCR said.
Currently, most South Sudan refugees are being hosted by Uganda, where some 698,000 have arrived.
Ethiopia ranks second with 342,000, while more than 305,000 are in Sudan.
In the Democratic Republic of Congo, Andreas Kirchhof, a UNHCR representative, told Al Jazeera aid workers faced difficulty in accessing the newly arrived refugees.
""There are security problems, which so far prevented us from reaching the areas. In border areas, there are several militia groups operating,"" he said.
It was difficult to peg the number of new refugee arrivals, he said.
But of the refugees he had seen, Kirchhof described them as ""looking exhausted after days of marching through the forest, as they avoid roads because they know that they might be killed"".
The UNHCR said it needs $782m in 2017 to support the refugees. In 2016, only 33 percent of the $649m fundraising goal was funded.

The measure will also apply to people in already existing facilities, who will be moved to the camps and kept there until their asylum claims are processed.
Prime Minister Viktor Orban's right-wing government said it had taken the tough new measure to deal with the thousands of people who have fled to Europe in the past two years. Orban's chief of staff described it as a protective measure.
""We need a legal system that protects us. This is a very serious change,"" Janos Lazar, head of the prime minister's office, said, adding that the measure would be enacted only when the government was in a state of emergency over migration. The government has declared the country to be in such a state since March of last year.
""Containers suitable for accommodating 200-300 people will be erected. Migrants will have to wait there for a legally binding decision on their claims,"" Lazar said.
Asylum seekers will be able to take part in court proceedings via telecommunications equipment that will be provided in the camps, he added.
IN PICTURES: Dark and smoky shelters for refugees stranded in Serbia
Lazar also said Hungary was ready to build a second, stronger fence on its southern border with Serbia and Croatia, and that the government was prepared to increase aid to charities working on the border.
Hungary built a previous border fence in September 2015 and introduced legislation making it a crime to climb or damage it. According to police, more than 2,200 arrests were made on the border between March 1 and March 22 of last year.
The border camp plan is part of a package of proposals to go before parliament, including one that would reintroduce automatic detention for asylum seekers, a measure suspended in 2013 after pressure from human rights groups.
Orban - who professes to be an admirer of US President Donald Trump - said last month that automatic detention was needed again in response to ""terror"" attacks in Europe, citing the November 2015 attacks in Paris.
Hungary's immigration policies have been roundly condemned by rights groups and refugee advocates, who say large numbers of people were already being held in closed camps.
""Automatic detention of all asylum seekers from the start until the end of the asylum procedure is a flagrant and clear breach of EU law and human rights standards,"" the Hungarian Helsinki Committee, a Budapest-based refugee rights group, told the AFP news agency, vowing to sue Hungary at the European Court of Justice in every case where refugees were illegally kept in custody.
""In addition, the indefinite detention of many vulnerable migrants, including families with small children, is cruel and inhuman.""
OPINION: Another incurable, ugly disease - Far-right populism
Hungary is also building four small military bases along the border to house some 3,000 soldiers who now patrol it alongside police. The barracks are also being built with shipping containers.
Orban said he was aware his plans went against the policies of the European Union, of which Hungary is a member, putting the country in ""open conflict"" with the 28-nation bloc.
In October last year, the majority of Hungarians voted against an EU referendum aimed at sharing 160,000 refugees around the 28-member bloc through mandatory quotas.
Hungary has since not accepted any asylum seekers allocated under the scheme.
In 2016, Hungary granted asylum, or some form of protection, to 425 people out of 29,432 applications.

In a unanimous decision, the panel of three judges from the San Francisco-based 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals declined on Thursday to block a lower-court ruling that suspended the ban and allowed previously barred travellers to enter the US.
Shortly after the ruling, Trump responded furiously on Twitter, writing his response in capital letters.
SEE YOU IN COURT, THE SECURITY OF OUR NATION IS AT STAKE!
He told reporters his administration ultimately would win the case and dismissed the ruling as ""political"".
Trump's January 27 order barred travellers from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen from entering for 90 days and all refugees for 120 days, except those from Syria, whom he would ban indefinitely. He said his directive was ""done for the security of our nation, the security of our citizens.""
District Judge James Robart in Seattle issued a temporary restraining order on the ban on February 4 after Washington and Minnesota states sued, prompting Trump to label him a ""so-called judge"".
The 9th Circuit judges noted that the states had raised serious allegations about religious discrimination.
Asked about Trump's tweet, Washington state Attorney General Bob Ferguson said: ""We have seen him in court twice, and we're two for two.""
An appeal to the Supreme Court is possible.
In its ruling on Thursday, the 9th US Circuit rejected the administration's claim that the court did not have the authority to review the president's executive order.
""There is no precedent to support this claimed unreviewability, which runs contrary to the fundamental structure of our constitutional democracy,"" it said.
Al Jazeera's Rob Reynolds, reporting from San Francisco, said the court presented ""a point-by-point rebuttal of the government's case in the ruling"".
Speaking to Al Jazeera, Melanie Sloan, a consultant and a longtime ethics monitor in Washington DC, said: ""This tells the world that there is a significant portion of our country that is not behind this kind of thing at all.
""We will work very, very hard to defeat this kind of discriminatory ban that really doesn't help anybody.""
Justice Robart's ban order temporarily suspended the nation's refugee programme and immigration from countries that the Trump administration says raise security concerns.
Justice department lawyers appealed to the 9th US Circuit, arguing that the president has the constitutional power to restrict entry to the US and that the courts cannot second-guess his determination that such a step was needed to prevent terrorism.
The states, however, said Trump's travel ban harmed individuals, businesses and universities.
Citing Trump's campaign promise to stop Muslims from entering the US, they said the ban unconstitutionally blocked entry to people based on religion.
Both sides faced tough questioning during an hour of arguments on Tuesday conducted by phone - an unusual step - and broadcast live on cable networks, newspaper websites and social media. It attracted a huge audience.
The judges chipped away at the administration's claim that the ban was motivated by ""terrorism fears"", but they also challenged the states' argument that it targeted Muslims.
Sloan, the Washington DC-based ethics monitor, said: ""It's really wonderful. As an American I can be so proud of these folks and the image we want to project to the world.
""I think you will see, going forward in the Trump administration, that often it will be lawyers and judges who will be on the forefront, stopping these abuses of power. Remember we are only in Week Three of the administration.""
Justice Robart temporarily halted the ban after determining that the states were likely to win the case and had shown that the ban would restrict travel by their residents, damage their public universities and reduce their tax base.
Robart put Trump's executive order on hold while the lawsuit worked its way through the courts.
After that ruling, the state department quickly said people from the seven countries with valid visas could travel to the US.
Commenting on the 9th Circuit decision, Noah Purcell, Washington state's solicitor general, described it as an ""excellent, well-reasoned, careful, thoughtful opinion that seriously considered all the government's arguments - and rejected them"".
He said it is ""important to recognise the real impact that this is already having on people's lives. We have just been hearing from people all over the state and all of the country about what a difference this has made, and we're so thrilled for that"".
The Supreme Court has a vacancy, but there is no chance Trump's nominee, Neil Gorsuch, will be confirmed in time to take part in any consideration of the ban.
The ban was set to expire in 90 days, meaning it could run its course before the court would take up the issue.
The US administration also could change the order, including changing its scope or duration.
""We could go on for several more rounds ... but presumably everything would be done very quickly, just as this has happened,"" David Levine, a law professor at the University of California's Hastings College in San Francisco, told Al Jazeera.
""The US government has several choices. One is that they could go to the Supreme Court in Washington ... to see if they can get a stay. The other thing they can do is try to and get a majority of judges in the 9th Circuit here to agree to review the ruling.
The government has 14 days to ask the 9th Circuit to have a larger panel of judges review the decision ""en banc"", or appeal directly to the Supreme Court, which will likely determine the case's final outcome.

In a ruling on Thursday, the court said a government order to shut the camp, which would have sent the refugees back to Somalia from the sprawling Dadaab camp, was illegal.
Judge John Mativo, who issued the ruling, said Kenya's internal security minister had abused his power by ordering the closure of the camp, which borders Somalia, in May last year.
According to Mativo, the order had been given without consulting the people who would be directly affected by its implications, which was a violation of Kenya's constitutional right to fair legal proceedings.
""Hence, the said decision is null and void,"" he ruled.
READ MORE: 'Forty percent of Somalis don't have enough food to eat'
Mativo also said that the order was discriminatory in nature and went against international treaties that protect refugees from being forced to return to persecution, adding that the Kenyan government had failed to prove Somalia was safe enough for the refugees.
Speaking to Al Jazeera, Amnesty International's Deputy Regional Director Michelle Kagari said a durable solution should be explored for Somali refugees.
""This would include, for example, exploring options for Somalis to be integrated into local communities. It would also include exploring options to increase resettlement opportunities for Somali refugees,"" she said.
The ruling also blocked a government decision to disband the Department for Refugee Affairs.
Amnesty International's East Africa chief, Muthoni Wanyeki, hailed the ruling as ""historic"". He said: ""Today is a historic day for more than a quarter of a million refugees who were at risk of being forcefully returned to Somalia, where they would have been at serious risk of human rights abuses.
""This ruling reaffirms Kenya's constitutional and international legal obligation to protect people who seek safety from harm and persecution.""
The government had been planning to shut down Dadaab for more than six months. In June, Somalia's ambassador to the US criticised the plan and said it would damage relations between Kenya and Somalia.
""Many parts of southern Somalia remain under the control of al-Shabab militias and there are almost daily clashes between them and Somali government forces, and African Union peacekeepers,"" Al Jazeera's Mohammed Adow, reporting from the Somali capital Mogadishu, said.
""If these people [refugees] were to be repatriated back here, they will be coming back to what is essentially a warzone.""
The government had denied that it would be abandoning refugees, saying it had made arrangements with the Somali government to resettle them.
In November, the closure was delayed by six months after calls by foreign nations to postpone it on humanitarian grounds.

Kenya says Dadaab has become a hive for the al-Shabab armed group, and that it is a drain on the economy.
Some refugees have voluntarily returned to Somalia in recent months, after pressure to close down the camp spread fear of being forcibly evicted among the residents of Dadaab.

Robert Goodwill, immigration minister, said in a statement on Wednesday evening that the UK could be ""proud"" of its efforts helping refugees as he announced the end of the Dubs programme, which will have helped 350 children resettle in the country when it ends in March.
The scheme, which took the form of an amendment to immigration legislation, was introduced last May after pressure from veteran British politician Lord Alf Dubs on the government to provide sanctuary to children stuck in makeshift camps in northern France.
Dubs himself arrived in Britain as a child refugee fleeing Nazi Germany during World War II.
About 200 children have arrived in the UK under the scheme since it took effect in October last year, with another 150 expected before it ends.
OPINION: Why doesn't Britain want to take refugee children?
""[The] UK has a proud history of providing protection for those in need, including some of the most vulnerable children affected by the migration crisis,"" said Goodwill.
""The government’s strategy is to support international efforts to find a comprehensive and sustainable solution to the refugee crisis; we must deal with its root causes, as well as respond to the consequences.""
Charities helping refugees in northern France had expected up to 3,000 child refugees to be supported under the scheme.
Care4Calais, one of the largest charities operating in the region, posted a status update on its Facebook page in response to the decision: ""We cannot let this happen"".
A petition launched by activists has already picked up more than 6,000 signatures.
Marta Welander, director of Refugee Rights Data Project, told Al Jazeera the decision to end Dubs was ""deplorable"".
""The UK government’s decision is a misguided and deplorable move that appears to go against principles of human rights and child protection,"" she said
""Our research indicates that refugee children living in precarious situations on the UK's doorstep remain in critical need of protection.""
Opposition politicians also weighed in, with Labour MP Yvette Cooper condemning the decision as ""shameful"".
""[The government] is completely wrong to close down Dubs scheme to help lone child refugees after less than 12 months! Refugee crisis hasn't gone away,"" she wrote on Twitter.
""US President trying to close refugee programmes altogether. Now UK Gov closing Dubs programme for most vulnerable refugees of all. Shameful.""
French authorities demolished the informal Calais refugee camp, known as The Jungle, in October.
About 1,179 of the 10,000-plus refugees living in the camp at the time were children.
The UK also operates another scheme for the resettlement of children, under which young refugees are reunited with family members already living in the UK.

The document, which argues that barring immigrants from seven mainly Muslim countries is a lawful exercise of the president's authority, was filed on Monday with the San Francisco-based 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals.
The move by the justice department comes after an appeals court over the weekend denied the Trump administration's request to immediately set aside a Seattle judge's ruling that put a hold on the ban nationwide.

The federal appeals court asked lawyers for the states of Washington and Minnesota, which are legally challenging Trump's order, and the justice department to argue at 23:00 GMT on Tuesday whether the ban should remain shelved.
""What will be argued in court is a very narrow legal interpretation, which is, does the president have the right to issue executive orders which can stop people coming into the country,"" Al Jazeera's Alan Fisher, reporting from Washington, DC, said.
Washington state and Minnesota sued Trump last week, saying that the ban harmed residents and effectively mandated discrimination.
The justice department says that the issue is a matter of national security and Trump's executive order was well within his authority.
""The noise that is coming out of the White House in the last few hours is that they believe they are on very solid ground and that the executive order will soon be resumed,"" Al Jazeera's Fisher said.

Earlier on Monday, White House spokesman Sean Spicer said the Trump administration was confident it will prevail in the lawsuit.
""Clearly, the law is on the president's side,"" Spicer told reporters on Air Force One.
""He has broad discretion to do what's in the nation's best interest to protect our people, and we feel very confident that we will prevail in this matter,"" he added.
The restrictions on all refugees and travellers from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen went into effect on January 27, causing chaos at airports across the US and leaving travellers trying to reach the country in limbo. Refugees from Syria were blocked indefinitely.
The political backlash for Trump has been equally severe, with the order prompting numerous mass protests.
OPINION: Trump's Muslim ban is a dangerous distraction
Top technology giants, including Apple, Google and Microsoft banded together with nearly 100 companies on Sunday to file a legal brief opposing Trump's immigration ban, arguing that it ""inflicts significant harm on American business"".
Noting that ""immigrants or their children founded more than 200 of the companies on the Fortune 500 list"", the brief said Trump's order ""represents a significant departure from the principles of fairness and predictability that have governed the immigration system of the United States for more than 50 years"".
The controversial executive order also ""inflicts significant harm on American business, innovation, and growth as a result,"" the brief added.
Trump, who - during his campaign - called for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the US, has repeatedly vowed to reinstate the ban.

A meeting of the cabinet, presided over by Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, on Tuesday pushed back the refugees' legal right to stay from the previous deadline of March 31, state-run APP news agency reported.
There are currently about 1.3 million registered Afghan refugees residing in Pakistan, according to the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR).
Many fled violence in their country more than 30 years ago, during the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, with others fleeing the US-led invasion in 2001.
There are also about a million unregistered Afghan refugees present in the country, Pakistani officials say.
A recent crackdown by Pakistani authorities, citing security concerns, has seen a sharp rise in both deportations and voluntary repatriations of Afghan nationals from the country.
READ MORE: A hard winter - Afghan refugees return from Pakistan
Last year, more than 600,000 Afghan refugees left Pakistan to return to their home countries, data from the UNHCR and the International Organization for Migration (IOM) shows.
For registered refugees, that number represents a more than six-fold increase from the previous year, according to UNHCR.
At least 22,559 Afghans were also deported by Pakistani authorities in that period, IOM says.
Refugees and rights groups say increased harassment by police and stricter restrictions on crossing and returning from Pakistan's northwestern border with Afghanistan have been responsible for the rising numbers.
The cabinet meeting on Tuesday reaffirmed those tighter controls on the border.
""It was also decided that the Afghans cross-border movement would now be regulated through the visa regime and their entry passes would be linked with it,"" reported APP.
In November 2015, US-based rights group Human Rights Watch documented a campaign of abuse and harassment of Afghan refugees by Pakistani police, involving confiscation of their registration cards, bribes and raids on their homes.

Pakistani officials deny there is any such policy or campaign.
Until last year, Pakistan regularly extended the Afghan refugees' legal status in the country for at least 12 months every year. In June, however, an extension of only six months was offered until December 31, 2016.
The next extension lasted only three months, until March 31, 2017.

Last Monday, the AU approved Morocco's re-entry into the bloc which it quit in 1984 in protest at the admission of the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR) declared by the Polisario Front at the height of a war for the territory.
""Not only does Morocco not recognise - and will never recognise - this so-called entity,"" Bourita told website Le Desk in an interview on Sunday.
""It will [also] redouble its efforts so the small minority of countries, particularly African, which recognise it, change their positions.""
AU membership would not change Morocco's stance that the Western Sahara is an integral part of its territory, he said.

Monday's summit in Addis Ababa followed an intense diplomatic battle with the Polisario's backers, led by Algeria and South Africa, which opposed Morocco rejoining the AU.
Meanwhile, the head of Western Sahara's Polisario Front has said ""all options are open"" in its independence struggle from Morocco, but called for talks after the kingdom rejoined the African Union.
Polisario head and SADR president Brahim Ghali told AFP in an interview on Sunday that the move did not fundamentally change the situation.
""We always look for the peaceful way"" to resolve the conflict, Ghali told AFP at a Sahrawi refugee camp in Tindouf, southwestern Algeria.
""But all options remain open,"" he said, hinting that a return to armed struggle was possible.

Thousands of Sahrawis are settled in five camps around Tindouf, where they receive aid from UN agencies and international NGOs.
Efforts to reach a negotiated solution for the territory have borne little fruit.
Ghali, who took over as leader of the Algeria-backed Polisario on the death of his predecessor Mohamed Abdelaziz in May 2016, said he hoped new UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres will push for a return to talks.
""We hope that he will have the necessary support of the Security Council to lead the negotiations that will enable the self-determination of our people,"" Ghali said.
A UN peacekeeping force, United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO), was set up in 1991 to monitor the ceasefire and organise a poll on the future of the territory.
The SADR, which remains a member of the AU, demands independence and a UN-supervised referendum to resolve the conflict.
Morocco, which controls 90 percent of the territory including its three main towns, insists it is an integral part of the kingdom and that only autonomy is on the table.

At a summit in Malta, the bloc's leaders on Friday decided to give 200m euro ($215m) to Libya's fragile government to step up efforts to stop migrant boats in the country's territorial waters.
Under the plan, the EU will also provide support for the setting up of ""safe"" refugee camps in Libya and the voluntary repatriation of refugees willing to return to their countries of origin.
It will also boost training and equipment to Libya's struggling coastguard and get more involved with neighbouring nations, including Algeria, Tunisia and Egypt, to contain the flows.
Aid groups, however, accused the EU - whose leaders are under popular pressure to be seen to be controlling immigration - of abandoning humanitarian values and misrepresenting conditions in Libya, where the UN-backed government of Fayez Seraj has only a shaky and partial hold on the country.
""Libya is not a safe place and blocking people in the country or returning them to Libya makes a mockery of the EU's so-called fundamental values of human dignity and rule of law,"" said Doctors Without Borders (known by its French initials, MSF), which works in camps there.
Others warned the deal could result in women and children being returned to inhumane conditions and left vulnerable to rape, beatings and forced labour, as well as forcible repatriation to uncertain fates in their home countries.
""Sending children back to a country many have described as a living hell is not a solution,"" said Ester Asin of British charity Save the Children, in advance of the approval of the widely trailed new EU strategy.
READ MORE: 2016 - The year the world stopped caring about refugees
Yves Pascouau, director of migration and mobility policies at the European Policy Centre, told Al Jazeera, that talk of ""stemming"" refugee flows and breaking the business models of people smugglers was futile.
""We all know that if we really want to break this business model, we also need to provide legal ways to enter the EU, which [do not exist] today,"" he said.
""There is only one focus [at the EU level] and that's the security-oriented dimension; the idea that we're going to stop arrivals from Turkey first and then from Libya.""
The chaos in Libya has thwarted any hope of a quick fix in the way that a controversial EU deal with Turkey a year ago led to a virtual halt to a migrant route to Germany via Greece along which a million asylum seekers travelled in 2015.
READ MORE: Ten countries host half of world's refugees
The agreement on Friday came a day after Seraj signed a deal with Italy, which offered 200 million euros ($215 million) of its own. Rome fears new arrivals this spring, following a record influx of 181,000 migrants last year, would put pressure on services and risk a popular backlash - especially since its EU neighbours are no longer letting most migrants travel north out of Italy.
Many EU governments are sceptical that the latest measures can have much effect on migration. One senior diplomat called it a ""long shot"". Several said the declaration was intended partly to appease Italian demands that the EU be seen to be acting.
In the longer run, analysts say European leaders are placing hopes in using their aid muscle in Africa to reduce incentives for people to leave, while giving African governments reasons to take back citizens who fail to win asylum in Europe.
Deporting more of those who reach Italy is part of a wider plan to send signals to Africans not to risk the Sahara and Mediterranean in the vain hope of a better life.
At Agadez in Niger, numbers gathering to cross the Sahara have plunged in recent months, which some EU officials think may indicate that strategy of deterrence is working. However, human smugglers may just have altered routes.

The Washington Post said Trump abruptly cut short the fiery conversation after criticising the agreement to resettle people kept in Pacific camps, sparking a war of words with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull on Thursday after the report surfaced.
Australia is considered a close US ally - one of the so-called ""Five Eyes"" with which the US routinely shares sensitive intelligence - and the call might have been expected to be smooth sailing.
But, according to the Post, Trump's assessment was the opposite.
Of his four conversations with world leaders that day, ""this was the worst call by far,"" it cited him as telling Turnbull, shortly before he terminated the telephone meeting.
Australian government sources told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation the report was ""substantially accurate"".
Turnbull said he was disappointed details of the ""very frank and forthright"" exchange had been leaked.
""As far as the call is concerned I'm very disappointed that there has been a leak of purported details of the call in Washington,"" he told Sydney radio station 2GB.
""But I want to make one observation about it - the report that the president hung up is not correct. The call ended courteously.""
READ MORE: Nauru - A place of abuse and desperation
He added that Canberra had ""very, very strong standards in the way we deal with other leaders and we are not about to reveal details of conversations other than in a manner that is agreed"".
The Post's account is markedly different from the official version of the call provided by both governments.
Turnbull said on Monday that Trump had agreed to honour the deal agreed with then president Barack Obama to resettle an unspecified number of the 1,600 people Australia holds in offshore detention centres on the islands of Nauru and Papua New Guinea.
There were fears the new US president would rescind it after he signed an executive order last week to suspend the arrival of refugees to the US for a least 120 days, and bar entry for three months to people from seven Muslim-majority countries.
After the Post story broke late on Wednesday, Trump weighed in on Twitter and threw the agreement into doubt.
Do you believe it? The Obama Administration agreed to take thousands of illegal immigrants from Australia. Why? I will study this dumb deal!
After seeing the tweet, Turnbull insisted that Trump had already agreed it would go ahead.
""The commitment made by the president in that call was made and we announced that and it was confirmed by his spokesman a day or so later,"" he said.
Reports of the Turnbull-Trump conversation came as the US and Mexican governments were denying claims that the former reality TV star had threatened to send troops into Mexico to deal with drug cartels.
Mexican journalist Dolia Estevez, citing ""confidential"" US and Mexican sources, said Trump made the threat during an hour-long phone call with President Enrique Pena Nieto on Friday.
Mexican and White House officials vehemently denied the report.
Relations have plunged into the biggest diplomatic crisis between the two neighbours in decades.
Trump angered Mexicans last week by ordering the construction of a massive border wall and vowing to make their country pay for it.
Pena Nieto has pledged that his government will never pay for the barrier and cancelled a meeting with Trump scheduled for this week in Washington.
In addition to the row over the wall, Trump wants to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico. Mexican officials expect talks to begin in May.

Canada plans to resettle 40,000 refugees and protected persons in the country this year, both through government support and private sponsorship.
""Our immigration levels plan has an allocation that is historically high for refugees,"" said Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Minister Ahmed Hussen earlier this week. ""We intend to maintain that plan.""
But human rights groups and refugee advocates are calling on Canada to lift its cap on refugee sponsorship in 2017, especially in light of curbs to immigration south of the border.
Passed last Friday, Trump’s executive order blocks immigration from Iran, Iraq, Syria, Yemen, Libya, Sudan and Somalia for 90 days, suspends the US refugee programme for 120 days, and indefinitely bars Syrian refugees from being resettled until such a time that is ""consistent with the national interest"".
The so-called ""Muslim ban"" has stranded travellers and visa- and green card-holders, and separated families.
""There’s obviously a very immediate and urgent concern that hundreds or even thousands of refugees have suddenly been left in the lurch, individuals who thought they were well on their way to being resettled in the United States,"" said Alex Neve, secretary general of Amnesty International Canada.
""Canada is very well placed to step in and ensure that another avenue to safety opens,"" Neve told Al Jazeera.
Over the weekend, as confusion reigned in airports around the world, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was praised after he tweeted: ""To those fleeing persecution, terror & war, Canadians will welcome you, regardless of your faith. Diversity is our strength #WelcomeToCanada"".
But Canada has already reached its cap of 1,000 new private sponsorship applications for Syrian and Iraqi refugees this year and the government does not plan to lift it.
READ MORE: Meet Syrian refugees and their Canadian sponsors
Private sponsorship allows local organisations that hold agreements with the government to resettle refugees. These groups are responsible for the family’s needs during their first year in Canada.
The government said it would grant temporary resident visas to anyone with a valid US visa who was stranded in Canada as a result of the executive order.
And Hussen said Ottawa has ""received assurances from the White House and other US authorities that Canadian citizens, Canadian dual citizens, and permanent residents with valid permanent resident cards continue to have access to the United States and are not affected"" by Trump's executive order.
But pressure is mounting on Ottawa to do more.
Among the calls for action, human rights groups are pushing Canada to lift the Safe Third Country Agreement. The agreement blocks asylum seekers who first land in the US from making an asylum application in Canada, save for a few exceptions, on the basis that the US is a ""safe country"" for refugees.
The Canadian Civil Liberties Association said the agreement should be suspended because it ""does not consider the US at this current time to be a 'safe third country'"".
But Hussen, the immigration minister, said this week that ""the conditions of that agreement continue to be met"".
READ MORE: 2016: The year the world stopped caring about refugees
Meanwhile, the New Democratic Party called for an emergency debate in the House of Commons on Tuesday to discuss Canada’s response. The party has called on Ottawa to lift the Safe Third Country Agreement and the cap on refugee resettlement, and fast-track refugee applications from the US.
""There is no question that this ban promotes hate and intolerance. This ban will have a disastrous effect for thousands of innocent travellers and refugees,"" said Jenny Kwan, a parliament member and the NDP’s immigration critic.
Canadians have also shown vocal opposition to the ban. Hundreds of people rallied in front of the US Consulate in downtown Toronto on Monday, chanting: ""No hate, no fear, refugees are welcome here!"".
""Trump claims that we need an extreme vetting process, which is kind of a ridiculous statement to me, because the vetting process for refugees and green card holders is extremely rigorous to begin with,"" said John Park, a US citizen who said he saw how difficult the process was for his wife to get a green card.
""To say that you need even more vetting is absolutely a red herring that Trump is appealing to peoples’ worst instincts. He is trying to make people think that refugees and foreigners are causing problems and that’s absolutely false.""
Anne Rubenstein, a history professor at York University in Toronto who took part in the protest, said she was ""so outraged [she] can barely find the words"".
""As Jews, we understand that banning people from a country because of their race and religion never ends well,"" Rubenstein told Al Jazeera.
""I hope we shut the consulate down here and I hope it stays shut down until they reverse this idiotic, appalling and illegal executive order. I’m disgusted, and I say that as a US citizen, as a Jew, and as a historian.""

The government has set up a committee made up of state officials in the coastal districts, ordering authorities to help identify and relocate undocumented Myanmar nationals to Thengar Char in the Bay of Bengal.
""The committee will assist transferring both registered and unregistered refugees from Myanmar to Thengar Char near Hatiya island in Noakhali district,"" according to an order issued by the Cabinet Division last week and posted online.
READ MORE: Rohingya camps in Bangladesh and Thailand, worlds apart
The relocation plan prompted outrage from Rohingya community leaders, while a UN agency said forced relocation would be ""very complex and controversial"".
Hatiya is on the estuary of the River Meghna and a nine-hour journey away from camps where the Rohingya have taken shelter.
Some 232,000 Rohingya Muslims - both registered and unregistered - were already living in Bangladesh before more than 65,000 stateless Rohingya fleeing violence in neighbouring Myanmar's western state of Rakhine began crossing into the country last October.
Most of those who fled to Bangladesh live in squalid conditions in refugee camps in Cox's Bazar district, which borders Rakhine state and is Bangladesh's biggest tourist resort.

Bangladesh has also asked officials in the border districts to identify Myanmar nationals who have ""illegally infiltrated"" the country.
""It has to be assured by taking preventive measures that they (refugees) cannot spread out and mix with the locals,"" read the order which was dated January 26.
""The identified refugees should be arrested or pushed back to the camps if they try to go out beyond the assigned boundary.""
Bangladesh first mooted the idea of relocating the refugees in 2015, despite allegations that the island was not ready for human habitation.
An official in the region criticised the idea, saying the 2,430-hectare island was ""only accessible during winter and a haven for pirates"".
The authorities were planting trees in a bid to shore up land against high tides and flooding, but those efforts were at least a decade away from completion, the official added.
""It completely inundates during the monsoon,"" the official told the AFP news agency, speaking on condition of anonymity.
""It's a terrible idea to send someone to live there.""
There was no immediate comment from the Rohingya community leaders.

Sally Yates had early on Monday ordered Department of Justice lawyers to stop defending Trump's executive order, resulting in her dismissal just hours later.
""The acting attorney general, Sally Yates, has betrayed the Department of Justice by refusing to enforce a legal order designed to protect the citizens of the United States,"" the White House press secretary's office said in an unusually caustic statement.
""Ms Yates is an Obama Administration appointee who is weak on borders and very weak on illegal immigration.""
READ MORE: What is wrong with Trump's immigration ban?
Yates had agreed to serve in an acting capacity until Senator Jeff Sessions, Trump's pick for US attorney general, was confirmed by the Senate. The White House said that Dana Boente, US attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, would now be acting US attorney general until Sessions is approved.
Boente said in an interview with the Washington Post that he would enforce the immigration order.
Political analyst Michael Shure told Al Jazeera that the incident could prove a ""stumbling block"" for Sessions' confirmation, with Democrats and some Republicans now expressing opposition to the ban.
""Many people I spoke to are saying it is 'foolish'. Why didn't Trump wait, if he believed in this executive order so much, until he had his team in place? Will that affect the nominating process for the attorney general? Could it hurt his nominee? That remains to be seen,"" Shure said.
The decision came as Trump pressed into his second week in office, defending his sweeping immigration ban in what has become a quickly escalating political crisis
Trump's order suspends the US refugee programme for 120 days and bars all immigration for citizens of Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen for at least 90 days. The intake of refugees from Syria - ravaged by a brutal war in which some estimates say 400,000 people have been killed - has been suspended indefinitely.
Trump has argued tougher vetting of immigrants is needed to protect the US from attacks, but critics complain that his order unfairly singles out Muslims and tramples on the nation's historic reputation as a welcoming place for immigrants.
Reaction to the order was swift, with protests erupting at major airports and other major cities, including the capital - Washington, DC - as customs officials struggled to put the ban into practice.
Trump denied that his order was to blame for weekend chaos at the nation's airports, instead pointing to computer glitches, the demonstrations and even the ""fake tears"" of a senior opposition senator, Democrat Charles Schumer.
READ MORE: Six other times the US banned immigrants
The president publicly shifted his focus on Tuesday, signing an executive action aimed at cutting regulations for small businesses and teasing plans to unveil his Supreme Court pick.
But the immigration ban remained at the forefront of his first fortnight in the White House - and officials were reported to be pondering more actions moving forward.
According to a draft document obtained by The Associated Press news agency, Trump is now considering an executive order that would target some immigrants for deportation if they become dependent on government assistance.
The draft order calls for the identification and removal ""as expeditiously as possible"" of any foreigner who takes certain kinds of public welfare benefits.
Such immigrants have been barred from the US for the better part of a century and they can already be deported. But the proposed order appears to signal a Trump administration effort to actively crack down on such welfare cases.
Another draft order under consideration would make changes to several of the government's foreign worker visa programs.
The White House did not immediately respond to requests for comments on the draft orders.
The furore has prompted Trump's predecessor Barack Obama to wade back into politics for the first time since leaving office and just 11 days into the new administration.
A spokesman for the former president said on Monday that Obama ""fundamentally disagrees"" with discrimination that targets people based on their religion. Obama spokesman Kevin Lewis alluded to, but did not specifically mention Trump's order, but added that Obama was ""heartened"" by the protests.

The former president had said he would give Trump room to govern but that he would speak out if he believed his successor was violating basic US values.
There have been only a handful of instances in US history of top justice department officials publicly breaking with the White House.
The most famous example was in 1973, when the then-attorney general, Elliot Richardson, and his deputy resigned rather than obey President Richard Nixon's order to fire a special prosecutor investigating the Watergate scandal.
The incident, which became known as the ""Saturday Night Massacre,"" was a public relations disaster and is seen as a turning point in Nixon's administration.

Khaled Akil's latest project is being exhibited from Tuesday at California's Stanford University.
Under Trump's recent executive order, which suspends travel for Syrian refugees indefinitely, there is no way he would be able to attend his opening.
""I understand they want to interview people and they have the right to know who is coming, but to give a racist order like this to prevent us is agonising,"" Akil told Al Jazeera.
Akil moved to Istanbul, Turkey, five years ago. Since 2012, he has applied twice to visit the US to attend exhibitions and was rejected on both occasions.
He fears that in the US, because of the travel ban, there was now ""justification for people to hate Syrians"".
""With Trump, I will never apply for the visa, whether or not a ban is in place,"" he said. ""The politics worries me because it creates the tension that I saw in my own country which led to more violence. That's why I can't trust the system any more, I won't feel safe there.""
Besides banning Syrian refugees, Trump's order also halts the US refugee programme for 120 days, and bars all immigration for citizens of Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen for at least 90 days.
Akil's exhibition in California, ""Requiem for Syria"", captures the hope and resilience of a population at war.
""It makes my heart sink that he can't be here,"" Anita Husen, Stanford's associate dean of students, told Al Jazeera.
""It's really sad that such a wonderful, talented artist who has generously offered Stanford to host his original prints, free of charge, will not be here to celebrate his opening,"" she added.
""Painting broad strokes to deny people right to entry ... is not making America any safer,"" Husen said. ""It's hurting our intellectual prowess.""
Akil's work has previously been exhibited at galleries in London, Beirut, San Francisco, Vermont and Istanbul.
One of his projects last year was titled ""Pokemon Go In Syria - Part 1"" and featured the animated figures in war-torn neighbourhoods.
""I will wait for at least four years [to apply for a US visa],"" said Akil, adding that each application costs $160.
""[Trump's] a racist man and I can't trust him. I trust the American people - they are also victims of this propaganda.""

Seen by Al Jazeera, Akil's 2016 rejection letter from the US consulate in Istanbul says that he was found ""ineligible for a nonimmigrant visa"".
""You have not demonstrated that you have ties that will compel you to your home country after your travel to the United States,"" the letter reads.
Trump's travel order has exacerbated Syrians' difficulties in travelling to the US.
The Syrian war began in March 2011. From 2012 to 2015, some 60,000 Syrians left their country, applied for visas and were rejected - four times the number of refusals than during the prior three-year period.
Staffan de Mistura, the UN special envoy for Syria, has estimated that 400,000 people have been killed in the Syrian conflict, which has also displaced millions.
""We are the first victims of this war, we are the victims of terrorism,"" said Akil, who explained that while he would not apply for another visa any time soon, he hopes to continue exhibiting his work in the US.
""It's very important for Americans to see Syria now. They're just getting what the media is providing them. If we show them our art, music and writing, we can introduce then to our culture and show them not all Syrians are terrorists.""
Akil is among a growing number of artists who are protesting the discriminatory travel measures.
Oscar-nominated Iranian director Asghar Farhadi said he would not attend the Academy Awards ceremony in late February, whether or not he would be granted an exception to enter the US.
Taraneh Alidoosti, who stars in Farhadi's celebrated film, ""The Salesman"", is also boycotting the event.
Malorie Blackman, a British children's author, said she would not travel to the US while the travel ban was in place in solidarity with those affected.

Comma Press, a UK-based publisher, said it would only translate authors from the seven banned nations in 2018.
Marcia Lynx Qualey, a Cairo-based literary critic, said: ""The violence of such an executive act cannot be countered solely with art, or translation.""
She called for the empowerment of authors from the affected countries through forging connections between those writers and literary communities, ""thus resisting the ban"".

Bissonnette faces six counts of first-degree murder and five of attempted murder, but has not been charged with any terrorism-related offences, despite Sunday's attack being widely condemned, including by Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, as a ""terrorist act"" against Muslims.
When asked on Tuesday why Bissonnette was not facing terrorism-related charges, Thomas Jacques, a representative of the prosecutor's office, replied: ""The charges laid correspond to the evidence available,"" said.
Prosecutors added that not all of the evidence was ready yet and Bissonnette, a 27-year-old anthropology and political science student at Laval University, was set to appear again on February 21.

Wearing a white prisoner jumpsuit, Bissonnette did not to speak or enter a plea over the attack at the Islamic Cultural Centre during evening prayers on Sunday.
The suspect was arrested in his car on a bridge about 5km east of Quebec City centre, where he called 911 to say he wanted to cooperate with police.
Authorities, who initially named two suspects, said the other man taken into custody was a witness to the attack and was released later on Monday.
They said they did not believe there were other suspects, but were investigating. Police did not give a motive for the attack.
Francois Deschamps, an official with a refugee advocacy group, told the Associated Press news agency that Bissonnette was known to those who monitor ""extremist groups"" in Quebec.
He had expressed support on his Facebook profile for Generation Nationale, a group whose manifesto includes the rejection of ""multiculturalism"". He also reportedly supports the French far-right party of Marine Le Pen.
""It's with pain and anger that we learn the identity of terrorist Alexandre Bissonnette, unfortunately known to many activists in Quebec for taking nationalist, pro-Le Pen and anti-feminist positions at Laval University and on social media,"" Deschamps wrote on the Facebook page of the Welcome to Refugees group.
More than 50 people were at the Quebec Islamic Cultural Centre when the shooting erupted.
In addition to the six dead, 19 people were wounded - all men. Of the five victims who remained in hospital, two were in critical condition, authorities said. The dead ranged in age from 39 to 60.

Canada is generally welcoming toward immigrants and all religions, but the French-speaking province of Quebec has had a long-simmering debate about race and religious accommodation.
The mosque where the shooting took place on Sunday was targeted before in an Islamophobic attack. Last year, a pig's head was left on its doorstep, alongside a note that read ""bon appetit"". Eating pork is forbidden in Islam.
According to Haroun Bouazzi, co-president of the Montreal-based rights group AMAL-Quebec, the list of Islamic places of worship and Muslim-owned businesses in Quebec that have been targeted by hate crimes in the last three years is endless.
Mosques have been set ablaze and vandalised, and schools and halal butcher shops have been shot at, but in many instances police have not labelled the attacks hate crimes, Bouazzi said.

""There are institutions, whether they are political or security-based, that closed their eyes to, that under-estimated, and that even in some cases were complicit with, an absolutely unacceptable situation for a religious minority in Quebec,"" he told Al Jazeera.
""We hope that what happened [in Quebec City] will be a wake-up call for everyone, that finally we will take this situation more seriously.""
Trudeau said in parliament that the victims were targeted simply because of their religion and spoke directly to the one million-plus Muslims who live in Canada, saying: ""We are with you.
""Thirty-six million hearts are breaking with yours. Know that we value you.""
The prime minister later attended a vigil outside the mosque.

The dead man is believed to be about 20 years old and from Pakistan, a police official on the island said. Another man who shared his tent was critically ill and taken to hospital.
The death at the island's Moria camp follows those of a 22-year-old Egyptian and a 46-year-old Syrian who shared a tent and died days apart. Greek media reported they had inhaled fumes from a heater, but authorities would not confirm or deny that.
Greece's migration minister Yannis Mouzalas ordered an investigation into the deaths, the causes of which remain unclear.
Steps would be taken ""to make the situation more manageable"", he was quoted by the Athens News Agency as saying.
""We wonder how many deaths it will take for the government to wake up,"" said Stavros Theodorakis, leader of the small centrist party To Potami.
At least 3,000 refugees and migrants are living in Moria, a hilltop former military base where conditions have deteriorated as they await, for months, word on their future.
The United Nations refugee agency and other international organisations have urged Greece to improve conditions at its overcrowded facilities.
""Something has got to give. We cannot tolerate this wanton loss of life,"" said International Rescue Committee Greece director Panos Navrozidis, acknowledging that conditions in Moria did not meet humanitarian standards.

As a mid-winter freeze gripped parts of the country earlier this month, thousands of asylum seekers endured sub-zero temperatures. Summer tents on Lesbos were weighed down by snow.
Across Greece, more than 60,000 refugees and migrants - most from Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan - have been stranded since last March, in formal or makeshift camps, which US-based group Human Rights Watch has described as ""deplorable and volatile.""
""We don't know yet how they died, but we do know the thousands stuck on the Greek islands have been suffering horrendous conditions in the cold, trapped by the failure of the EU to offer protection and dignity,"" said Gauri van Gulik, Amnesty International's Europe director.
Earlier this month, Germany announced its intent to start deporting newly arrived asylum seekers back to Greece, despite a five-year suspension of such returns due to the poor conditions in Greek camps.
That decision came just a month after the European Commission recommended that member countries return refugees and migrants who first entered the EU in Greece back to that country.
The announcements have been widely condemned by rights groups and humanitarian organisations.

In the US capital, thousands gathered outside the White House, while more than 1,000 protesters assembled in New York City's Battery Park to demonstrate against Trump's executive order, which places harsh restrictions on immigration from seven Muslim-majority countries.

Speaking to Al Jazeera in Battery Park, Hizam Mohammed Saleh, a 45-year-old of Yemeni descent, said: ""I came here because I want peace for everyone, for the immigration law to be the same for everyone.""
Jessica Taube, 37, brought her children to the protest. ""I don't believe in borders. We're all humans and we all share the same world and deserve a place to be happy and healthy,"" she told Al Jazeera.
""I have my kids here because I want them to learn that ... In this era of Trump, that's what is going to save us - community.""
Protests also gripped Atlanta, Austin, Baltimore, Boston, Boise, Chicago, Dallas, Detroit, San Francisco and other cities across the country.

A day earlier, thousands of protesters amassed at airports across the country as news spread that immigrants and travellers were being detained there. Among those held were legal residents who carry US green cards.
Demonstrators only dispersed when a federal judge blocked part of Trump's executive order on immigration, ruling that travellers who have already landed in the US with valid visas should not be sent back to their home countries.
Lawyers had filed a legal case in response to the order that includes a 90-day entry ban on citizens of Syria, Iraq, Somalia, Sudan, Iran, Libya and Yemen.
US District Judge Ann Donnelly's ruling late on Saturday concerns dozens of people who were held at airports following Trump's actions. The total number of people held was unclear.
OPINION: Trump's Muslim ban is a dangerous distraction
Some reports said immigration authorities were still implementing the ban sporadically in a number of airports.
Attorney generals from 16 US states - including California, New York and Pennsylvania - issued a joint statement on Sunday condemning Trump's move.
""We are committed to working to ensure that as few people as possible suffer from the chaotic situation that it has created,"" the statement said.
US senators John McCain and Lindsey Graham, both from Trump's Republican Party, said on Sunday that the president's order may do more to help recruit ""terrorists"" than improve US security.

""Ultimately, we fear this executive order will become a self-inflicted wound in the fight against terrorism,"" they said in a statement, adding that the US should not stop green card holders ""from returning to the country they call home.
""This executive order sends a signal, intended or not, that America does not want Muslims coming into our country. That is why we fear this executive order may do more to help terrorist recruitment than improve our security,"" said McCain, of Arizona, and Graham, of South Carolina.
The top Democrat in the US Senate said on Sunday that he will push legislation to undo the discriminatory ban.
Senator Chuck Schumer called the executive order ""mean-spirited and un-American"" and said it must be reversed immediately.

Amid growing global criticism, outrage from civil rights groups and legal challenges, Trump defended the ban on Sunday.
He and senior aides sought to defend the policy and play down the chaos sparked by Friday's order.
US Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly said in a statement that people from the seven countries who hold green cards as lawful permanent US residents would not be blocked from returning to the United States from overseas, as some had been after the directive.
""Our country needs strong borders and extreme vetting, NOW. Look what is happening all over Europe and, indeed, the world - a horrible mess!"" Trump wrote on Twitter on Sunday.

Gunmen fired on about 50 people inside the Quebec Islamic Cultural Centre on Sunday at 8pm local time (01:00 GMT).
""Six people are confirmed dead - they range in age from 35 to about 70,"" Quebec provincial police spokeswoman Christine Coulombe told reporters, adding that eight people were wounded and 39 were unharmed.
Police said two suspects had been arrested, but gave no details about them or what prompted the attack.
The mosque's president, Mohamed Yangui, was not inside the mosque at the time of the shooting. He received frantic calls from worshippers.
He said: ""Why is this happening here? This is barbaric.""
Speaking to Al Jazeera by phone, he said: ""One of the administrators called me and said there was a shooting at the mosque. I am still in shock. I ran to the mosque ... I was told that one attacker was arrested at the scene while another one was arrested nearby.""
Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau condemned the shooting as a ""terrorist attack on Muslims in a centre of worship and refuge"".
""Muslim Canadians are an important part of our national fabric, and these senseless acts have no place in our communities, cities and country,"" he said in a statement.
The shooting came on the weekend that Trudeau said Canada would welcome refugees, after US President Donald Trump suspended the US refugee programme and temporarily barred citizens from seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the country.
Philippe Couillard, premier of Quebec, said on Twitter that Sunday's attack ""is a terrorist act"", and called for ""solidarity with Quebecers of the Muslim faith"".
Tonight, Canadians grieve for those killed in a cowardly attack on a mosque in Quebec City. My thoughts are with victims & their families.
// <![CDATA[
// ]]]] >
The mosque leader Yangui added that the centre had not received any threats immediately before the attack.
""The neighbourhood is very peaceful. We have a good relationship with the government, the mayor of Quebec. We have no problem whatsoever,"" he said.
Writing on its Facebook page after the attack, the centre said: ""All of our thoughts are with the children to whom we must announce the death of their father"".
The mosque was previously targeted in an Islamophobic attack. In June 2016, during Ramadan, a pig's head was left on the mosque's doorstep along with a note that said ""bon appetit"". Pork is forbidden in Islam.
""We are not safe here,"" said Mohammed Oudghiri, who normally attends prayers at the mosque in the middle-class residential area, but did not on Sunday.
Speaking to Reuters, Oudghiri said he had lived in Quebec for 42 years but was now ""very worried"" and thinking of moving back to Morocco.
OPINION: The death of multiculturalism in Quebec
Basem Boshra, managing editor of the Montreal Gazette, told Al Jazeera that the centre is the city's biggest mosque of six, with some 5,000 members.
""There's a pretty strong Muslim community in Quebec City,"" he said, adding that there were plans to lower flags at the national assembly as a mark of respect for the victims
Ralph Goodale, Canada's public safety minister, said on Twitter that he was ""deeply saddened"" by the loss of life and injuries.
Greg Fergus, an MP in Quebec, described on Twitter the attack as ""a terrorist act - the result of years of demonizing Muslims"".
New York Mayor Bill de Blasio said police were providing additional protection for mosques in that city following the Quebec shooting. ""All New Yorkers should be vigilant. If you see something, say something,"" he tweeted.
Incidents of Islamophobia have increased in Quebec in recent years.
The full-face covering became a big issue in the 2015 Canadian federal election, especially in Quebec, where the majority of the population supported a ban on it at citizenship ceremonies.
Q&A: Quebec minister defends religious ban
In 2013, police investigated an incident in which a mosque in the Saguenay region of the province was splattered with what was believed to be pig blood.
In the neighbouring province of Ontario, a mosque was set on fire in 2015, a day after an attack by gunmen and suicide bombers in Paris.
""It's a sad day for all Quebecers and Canadians to see a terrorist attack happen in peaceful Quebec City,"" said Mohamed Yacoub, co-chairman of an Islamic community centre in a Montreal suburb. ""I hope it's an isolated incident.""

Hundreds of demonstrators chanted ""No ban, no wall, sanctuary for all!"" and ""No hate, no fear, immigrants are welcome here!"" while gathering outside the airport's Terminal Four arrivals section.
Other protests were held at airports in Chicago, San Francisco, and Washington DC, among other US cities.
The protests came in response to passport holders from Arab countries being blocked on Saturday from passing through customs at US airports, while others were prevented from boarding US-bound planes.
On Friday, Trump signed an executive order to curb immigration and the entry of people from some Muslim-majority countries. He separately said he wanted the US to give priority to Syrian Christians fleeing the civil war there.
Trump placed a four-month hold on allowing refugees into the country and temporarily barred travellers from Syria and six other Muslim-majority countries.
The protest was attended by several New York-based organisations, including Make the Road New York, Jews for Racial and Economic Justice (JFREJ), Black Latino Asian Caucus members and The New York Immigration Coalition, among others.
Speaking to Al Jazeera, Julia Carmel, an organiser with JFREJ, decried Trump's executive order.

""The purpose of our protest at JFK airport is twofold. First, we are demanding the safe release of refugees and other visa-holders, all of whom cooperated with a long and gruelling vetting process in order to get here,"" she said.
""Additionally, the central message of our protest is that we are all immigrants or children of immigrants and refugees. The executive order is not only inhumane; it is absurd and hypocritical,"" she added, pointing out that the ban came into effect on Holocaust Remembrance Day (Friday).

Tara Raghuveer, a 24-year-old national immigrant rights organiser with Make the Road New York, described the executive orders as ""deeply un-American"".
""They go against everything our country aspires to stand for,"" she told Al Jazeera at the protest.
Kazi Fouzia, a 48-year-old Bangladeshi immigrant and activist with Desis Rising Up and Moving, said she came to the protest to say: ""Banning one of us is banning all of us. Terrorising one of us is terrorising all of us.""
Fouzia, who has lived in New York City for ten years, added: ""We are here to make sure every single person held in JFK will be released ... we have to take down the policy.""
Trump administration officials have defended the executive order. Speaking to reporters on Saturday, a senior US administration official confirmed that the restrictions will affect legal permanent residents, known as green card holders, on a case-by-base basis.
For at least 90 days, citizens of Iraq, Iran, Somalia, Yemen, Sudan and Libya are barred from entering the country. Syrians have been banned from entering the US indefinitely.

Immigrants from the seven countries have been blocked from boarding US-bound planes in Lebanon, Egypt, United Arab Emirates and elsewhere.
Legal representatives for two Iraqi men filed lawsuits against Trump and the US government on Saturday, according to the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), a rights group.
Both men had ties to the US military and had visas. They were detained on Friday night in JFK Airport.
""President Trump's war on equality is already taking a terrible human toll. This ban cannot be allowed to continue,"" said Omar Jadwat, director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, in a statement.

""It's a nightmare, this agony ..."" he sighs, his voice worn out and distant.
""Everywhere we went, there were people in the water. The only thing I'm hoping is that there is no one missing,"" he continues, his gaze darkening as the memories of yet another grim day flood back to him.
READ MORE: Spurned, hopeless and attacked, refugees' drama goes on
These closing sequences are as powerful as every other scene in Daphne Matziaraki's film 4.1 Miles, nominated this week for an Oscar in the Best Documentary Short category.
Over 21 minutes, Matziaraki captures the efforts of Papadopoulos, a Greek coastguard captain, as he and his small crew rescue men, women and children in the waters surrounding the island of Lesbos - just 4.1 miles from the Turkish coast - in late 2015.
The footage is captivating and hard-hitting, often unnerving. In one particularly poignant scene, Papadopoulos' boat is gradually filled with frightened, wailing children as a handful of crew members frantically tries to pull to safety dozens of refugees, one-by-one.
But not everyone makes it.
""Oh my God, she has two children with them,"" a panicked voice is heard screaming, as a mother falls back into the rough sea with her son and daughter.
Instantly, there is chaos, tears and desperation.
The crew eventually manages to rescue the family, but the children are unconscious. The camera pointedly stays away, capturing from afar the frenzied efforts of Papadopoulos and his crew as they pump the small bodies in a bid to bring them back to life.
""I had never seen so many people, so many children, so many families being so scared,"" Matziaraki tells Al Jazeera.
WATCH 4.1 MILES HERE
The Greek filmmaker, who made her debut with award-winning 4.1 Miles, joined Papadopoulos and his team on their boat for three weeks, but all the rescue scenes included in the film are from October 28, 2015 - her first day on the ship.
""That day wasn't very different to every other day that followed,"" she recalls, ""but I was so shocked by what I witnessed in that first time.
""I think this is really conveyed in the footage, and I really wanted the audience to have this experience in the same way that I had it.""
Matziaraki was in the United States when her country - already struggling after years of a deepening recession - was confronted with a worsening refugee crisis, the worst since World War II. During 2015, some 600,000 people made the crossing from Turkey to Lesbos; across Greece, the figure topped 820,000.
California-based Matziaraki, who has also worked as a journalist in East Africa and Europe, decided to return home to shoot a documentary that would ""bridge this gap between our everyday lives, where we are in a safe comfort zone, and what is actually happening out there in the real world"", she says.

Yet upon arriving in Lesbos, she encountered a situation far worse than what she had imagined.
""There were just four Greek coastguard boats, with four-five crew on them, and one helicopter from the European border patrol - and that was it,"" the young director says.
""The scale of the emergency was so big that I would expect tonnes of helicopters and ambulances and big boats rescuing these people - but there was no help. I just couldn't believe that nobody in the world was providing a safe passage for these people and they were just letting them drown.""
Instead, it was people like Papadopoulos - whose jobs up until that point simply involved routine border patrols around Lesbos - who were charged with responding to the massive crisis.
""You cannot even begin to compare the numbers,"" the captain says in the film. ""Every hour that goes by, 10 of us are asked to rescue an influx of 200 people [from Turkey].""
Moreover, most of the coastguard crew did not have CPR training, while their boats lacked basic equipment to deal with such emergencies, according to Athens-born Matziaraki.
""The Greek coastguard was not prepared or equipped to undertake this,"" she says. ""They felt alone and abandoned; the captain thought that the entire world is turning their backs to this crisis, and they are leaving this overwhelming burden to be carried by them.""
At one moment in the film, Papadopoulos recalls the arrival of 20 Afghan refugees to Lesbos in 2001, describing it as the biggest news of that year.
Back then, things used to be easy, he says, ""under control"", but today everything has changed - including his own life.
""It's an overwhelming and a haunting nightmare that the captain is going through,"" says Matziaraki of Papadopoulos, whose daily rescue operations - sometimes more than five a day - have saved the lives of thousands of refugees.
""The burden is more than he can handle, and that comes not from the intensity, but from a feeling of duty.
""He is a truly honourable man who has a real sense of responsibility that he cannot afford to lose one person - and the people and the children that he does lose really haunt him.""
In the months after Matziaraki shot 4.1 Miles, arrivals in Lesbos and other Greek islands sharply decreased, mainly due to a series of Balkan border closures and a controversial EU-Turkey deal aimed at stopping the flow of refugees into Europe - an agreement that has been widely criticised both by aid groups and United Nations agencies.
Yet, more than 62,000 people still remain stranded across Greece, often living in appalling conditions.
""It may be that some time has passed since I shot that film, but it couldn't be more timely and relevant,"" Matziaraki says, citing the collapse of the EU-Turkey treaty and actions such as US President Donald Trump's executive order banning refugees from entering the country.
""At the moment, I feel we are in a very dark place in the world, so it's very hard to be optimistic because of the developments in the US and Europe.
""But it's very optimistic that the Academy chose to honour the film because it means that at least in the world of cinema, art and journalism there is a huge recognition that this is a really important story that is affecting all of us,"" she says.
""Its choice echoes the message of the film that we are really interconnected and that we are all the same.""
4.1 Miles, which premiered in September 2016 as part of New York Times Op-Docs, has already won several accolades, including a Student Academy Award Gold Medal last year.
The Academy Awards' ceremony will be held in the US city of Los Angeles on February 26.

Lawyers had filed a legal case in response to the order that includes a 90-day entry ban on citizens of seven Muslim-majority nations.
US District Judge Ann Donnelly's ruling late on Saturday concerns dozens of people who were detained at US airports following Trump's actions.
The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), which had filed a class action lawsuit against the ban, hailed the temporary stay of execution as a victory.
""This ruling preserves the status quo and ensures that people who have been granted permission to be in this country are not illegally removed off US soil,"" Lee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, said.
ACLU said it would help 100 to 200 people with valid visas or refugee status, who found themselves detained in transit or at US airports after Trump signed the order late on Friday.
The legal case was raised after two Iraqis were held by law enforcement officials at John F Kennedy International Airport (JFK) while trying to legally enter the country.
At least 12 travellers have been detained at JFK, prompting mass protests at the airport.
Less than 24 hours into the ban, Homeland Security said that at least 109 travellers had been denied entry into the US in total.
Homeland Security said on Sunday it would ""comply with judicial orders"", referring to Donnelly's ruling, but that Trump's order remains in place.
A group of state attorneys general, meanwhile, are discussing whether to file their own court challenge against the order, officials in three states told the Reuters news agency.
Officials in the offices of attorneys general in Pennsylvania, Washington and Hawaii said they were evaluating what specific claims could be filed, and in which court.
READ MORE: World leaders condemn Trump's 'Muslim ban'
Trump signed the executive order on Friday that effectively denies entry to people from seven Muslim-majority countries, including those with green cards, who otherwise have permanent residence in the US.
Signing the order at the Pentagon, Trump said the move would help protect Americans from ""terrorist"" attacks.
""It's been absolute chaos at airports across the country,"" Abed Ayoub, legal and policy director of the Arab-American Anti-Discrimination Committee, told Al Jazeera. ""It's definitely not making America safe again, it's just making America hate again.""
He added that the order ""doesn't only concern American Muslims, it concerns Americans. [Trump's] hate rhetoric is turning into destructive policies.""
In the case of war-torn Syria, Trump qualified the order's scope by saying he would prioritise Syrian Christians entering as refugees.
Al Jazeera's John Hendren, reporting from Chicago's O'Hare International Airport, said: ""People who were already here are not allowed to be deported under that court order ... [But] this was only a temporary reprieve. Not everybody who has been trying to get into this country has been able to get here. We really don't know the end of this story.""
The order limits entry for at least 90 days from Syrian travellers and other Muslim-majority countries, but did not list the countries by name. The state department said the three-month ban in the directive applied to Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen - all Muslim-majority nations.
Al Jazeera's Osama Bin Javaid, reporting from Erbil in northern Iraq, said: ""There is a lot of angst among the Kurdish population of Iraq, because if there's a spat between Baghdad and Washington, these are the people who will be worst affected.""
He added: ""So far from the people we have spoken to there is anger and shock. These are people who have been working side-by-side with American forces and contractors in various roles. They are not sure how it's going to pan out. Families have been separated.""
Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau weighed in on Saturday on Trump's orders with a decidedly different approach.
""To those fleeing persecution, terror & war, Canadians will welcome you, regardless of your faith. Diversity is our strength #WelcomeToCanada,"" he tweeted, along with a photograph of him greeting a Syrian child at a Toronto airport.
A spokeswoman for Trudeau told The Associated Press, he is ""looking forward to discussing the successes of Canada's immigration and refugee policy"" when he meets with Trump at the White House - a meeting that is expected in the near term.
""I think we keep fighting,"" Sarah Owing, with the American Immigration Lawyers Association's, told Al Jazeera. ""We're not going to rest until we make sure that the constitutional rights of lawful permanent residents are respected, and that those that seek asylum on our shores are entitled and given all the rights to seek that form of relief.""

May said the ban, which affects refugees, migrants, and visitors, was a ""matter for the US"" but later issued a statement that she disagreed with it.
The ban means a number of British citizens with dual nationality will not be allowed to enter the US, including Somalia-born Olympic gold medallist Mo Farah and Iraqi-born MP Nadhim Zahawi, a member of May's Conservative Party.
Citizens of Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen are banned from entering the US, even if they hold permanent residency or valid visas.
I'm a British citizen & so proud to have been welcomed to this country. Sad to hear ill be banned from the USA based on my country of birth
Leader of the opposition Labour Party, Jeremy Corbyn, said the government's lack of response was a ""disgrace"" and called for Donald Trump to be banned from the UK in response.
""[Trump] should not be welcomed to Britain while he abuses our shared values with shameful #MuslimBan and attacks on refugees and women."" Corbyn wrote on his Twitter account.
""[May] would be failing the British people if she does not postpone the state visit and condemn Trump's actions in the clearest terms,"" he added.

The opposition leader called on Britons to sign a parliamentary petition demanding that Trump be barred from the UK, which has picked up hundreds of thousands of signatures so far.
The response means parliament must consider debating a ban.
May met Trump at the White House on Friday, in a cordial meeting in which the pair held hands and promised stronger trade and security ties between their two countries.
The British prime minister used the meeting to invite Trump to visit the UK on a formal state visit.
Tim Farron, the leader of the Liberal Democrats, echoed calls for Trump to be banned, telling broadcaster Sky News that an invitation should ""never have been made"" .
Senior Scottish National Party politician Alex Salmond said May's conduct was a ""shameful moment of cowardice"" .
Despite stopping short of condemning May, Conservative MPs joined criticism of Trump's ban.
""President Trump's immigration and Syrian refugee ban is indefensible, unworkable and almost certainly unconstitutional,"" wrote Conservative MP James Cleverly on Twitter.
Trump's latest histrionic plan is nuts, unsustainable and counter-productive-all power to the courts and Congress to overturn it
British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said the country would defend the rights of British citizens abroad, in a tweet aimed at the US measures.
""We will protect the rights and freedoms of UK nationals home and abroad. Divisive and wrong to stigmatise because of nationality,"" he wrote.
Religious groups also condemned May's stance on Trump; the Muslim Council of Britain (MCB) said May should have used her time with the US president to remind him of the countries' shared values.
""In front of Mr Trump, the Prime Minister said that the point of the 'Special Relationship' was to have a frank dialogue. Well, this is one area where we need to be frank about where we stand,"" said Harun Khan, the MCB's secretary general.

Tal Ofer, of the Board of Deputies, the UK's leading Jewish organisation, said: ""I wouldn't be surprised if the PM offered Trump her famous 'Go Home' vans"" - a reference to May's deployment of trucks carrying banners telling migrants to leave the UK when she was home secretary.
Anger was also palpable on social media, with the hashtag TheresaTheAppeaser trending in the UK, as well as several related hashtags.
#TheresaTheAppeaser shows just how desperate the position for the UK is post Brexit. Willing to accept openly fascist policy for trade
Many users compared May's behaviour to former British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain's during the run-up to World War II.

Others said they were embarrassed at the deferential manner in which May had behaved towards Trump.
She did the equivalent of handing the car keys back to a drunk who intends to drive, saying ''it's up to him'' #TheresaTheAppeaser
Anti-Fascist groups have organised several protests against Trump, with one due to be held outside Downing Street Monday evening.

""We were very shocked Saturday morning when we saw the mosque burning,"" Shahid Hashmi, president of the Islamic Centre, told Al Jazeera.
According to local reports, the building caught fire shortly after 2am local time.
Now, the outpouring of monetary and moral support has shocked Hashmi again: ""It's incredible. We are very grateful.""
Hashmi had just come from a meeting with representatives from the local synagogue and churches, as well as laypeople. ""Muslims came from Houston, Dallas, which is four hours away … It was really heartwarming, everything has been good.""
But the mosque's destruction has sent ripples throughout the community. The Victoria police and fire department are working with the FBI, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms to determine the fire's cause.
""I hope it wasn't a hate crime,"" Hashmi continued. The doctor has lived in the so-called ""Bible Belt,"" one of the most conservative parts of the United States, for 40 years. The mosque was constructed in 2000, just a year before the September 11 attacks.

When asked how the political climate after President Trump signed the ""Muslim ban"" compared to the times after September 11, which saw a massive spike in hate crimes, Hashmi said it's ""about the same"".
He added: ""Nothing hateful has been expressed locally. Nationally, obviously, there are many more voices that are anti-Muslim.""
The Victoria Fire Department told Al Jazeera an investigation is ongoing.
Although it remains unclear if the mosque was burned down deliberately, John Esposito of the Bridge Initiative, a research project that connects the academic study of Islamophobia with the public square, explained that hate crimes have risen since Trump's inauguration.
Some of the hate crimes targeting Muslims seemed to be inspired by the new president, Esposito told Al Jazeera. ""We see with the number of hate crimes - not all [of them] - people are saying lines that Mr Trump has used,"" he said.
Saturday evening, a federal judge in New York blocked deportations stemming from the order.
Commenters on the GoFundMe page are speaking out against a perceived national wave of discrimination and the Trump administration.
Benjamin Tamber-Rosenau, who donated $100, wrote that his ancestors fled to the US from Europe due to persecution of Jewish communities.
""Now we are watching another community become victims of baseless hatred here in the United States, with the complicity (at minimum) of a depressingly large part of our government, including our president … whatever the cause of this fire, no community should lose its home,"" he wrote.
OPINION: Trump's Muslim ban is a dangerous distraction
Martin Wagner, another donator, had one of the highest-rated comments: ""I'm an atheist and I am deeply saddened and disgusted by what was done to you. Religious freedom and freedom from persecution are fundamental rights!""
With so many donations coming in, Hashmi happily commented there might be enough funds to rebuild by the end of the weekend. He is in contact with the original builder of the mosque who is ready to help, and the next step is to clear the debris and attain building permits.
""God willing, we will celebrate Ramadan in the new mosque,"" Hashmi concluded.

Number of refugees US plans to accept cut to 50,000

Three-month ban reportedly applied to Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia, Yemen
President Donald Trump has signed an executive order suspending the US refugee programme for 120 days, specifically barring Syrian refugees until further notice.
Trump signed the order at the Pentagon, saying the moves would help protect Americans from ""terrorist"" attacks.
""I'm establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America. Don't want them here,"" Trump said earlier on Friday.

""We only want to admit those into our country who will support our country and love deeply our people,"" he said.
France and Germany are ""concerned"" over Trump's move to restrict refugee arrivals, French Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault said. ""This decision can only cause us concern,"" he said following a meeting with his German counterpart Sigmar Gabriel. ""Welcoming refugees who are fleeing war is part of our duty.""
Meanwhile, a spokesman for Czech President Milos Zeman praised Trump's steps.
""Trump protects his country, he's concerned with the safety of his citizens. Exactly what EU elites do not do,"" Zeman's spokesman Jiri Ovcacek said in a tweet.
Civil rights groups condemned the measures as discriminatory.
""Trump's latest executive order is likely to hurt the people most in need: those fleeing violence and terrorism - and on Holocaust Remembrance Day, no less,"" said Grace Meng, senior US researcher at Human Rights Watch.
""The decision to drastically curtail the refugee programme will abandon tens of thousands to the risk of persecution or worse and cede American leadership on a vitally important issue,"" Meng added.
The order suspends the Syrian refugee programme until further notice, and will eventually give priority to minority religious groups fleeing persecution. Trump said in an interview with a Christian news outlet the exception would help Syrian Christians fleeing the civil war.
His order had been expected to include a directive about setting up ""safe zones"" for Syrian refugees inside the country, but no such language was included.

The measure limits entry for at least 90 days from Syria and other Muslim-majority countries, but did not list the countries by name.
The state department said the three-month ban in the directive applied to Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen - all Muslim-majority nations.
Al Jazeera's Dorsa Jabbari, reporting from Tehran, said: ""[Iranians] are shocked and astonished that this has taken place. There's more than one million Iranians living in the US. A lot of them have extended family, or their children, or their parents still in Iran.""
Ardeshir Namavar, a US green card holder currently in Tehran, told Al Jazeera: ""We feel really terrible about the news. I bought my ticket [to the US] and have a flight in 10 days; now we don't know what we are going to do. All of my family are in the US including my mother and father. They are American citizens. I had planned to study there, now everything has changed.""
The order said all immigration programmes should include questions to ""evaluate the applicant's likelihood of becoming a positively contributing member of society"".
Jennifer Sime, the senior vice president of US programmes at the International Rescue Committee, an NGO that works with refugees, told Al Jazeera: ""I think it's important to understand that there is already a robust vetting process in place. It was reviewed a few days ago and new things were added to enhance the vetting process.""
She added that refugees were already the ""single most vetted population coming into the US"".
On the exception in the order that favours Syrian Christian refugees, Sime said: ""The first thing to remember is that this programme [was] based on the principle of non-discrimination, so it's not about choosing Muslims or Christians. Refugees are selected based on need, urgency and basically their cases, not based on political affiliation and religion.""
""Extreme vetting"" is a euphemism for discrimination against Muslims. Period.
Trump's order cuts the number of refugees the US plans to accept this budget year by more than half, to 50,000 people from around the world.
During the last budget year, the US accepted 84,995 refugees, including 12,587 people from Syria. President Barack Obama had set the current refugee limit at 110,000.

During the Obama administration, vetting for refugees included in-person interviews overseas, where they provided biographical details about themselves, including their families, friendships, social or political activities, employment, phone numbers, email accounts and more.
They also provided biometric information, including fingerprints. Syrians were subject to additional, classified controls that administration officials at the time declined to describe, and processing for that group could routinely take years to complete.
Following Trump's signing of the order, the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), a US Muslim advocacy and civil rights group, said it would file a ""federal lawsuit on behalf of more than 20 individuals challenging the 'Muslim ban'"".

With a pen stroke, a wedding is missed, a eulogy isn't spoken, a job is not taken, a family is left broken, safety isn't found. #MuslimBan
Disappointed at media headlines referring to #MuslimBan using Trump's ""radical Islamic terrorists"" frame. Say it for what it is: racism.
This isn't about national security. It's about white supremacy. #RefugeesWelcome #MuslimBan #NoBanNoWall
American foreign policy has played active role in creating the same refugees that we are now banning & denying a safe home. 1/2 #MuslimBan
Mark my words: Even after the #MuslimBan , many Democrats will still continue to cooperate with Trump. Tells you everything you need to know.
Don't get it twisted, the #MuslimBan is also fortification and recentering of whiteness.
#MuslimBan , wall, undoc immigrant crime list, false urban crime stats- ALL targeted efforts to dehumanize people of color. Q is to what end?
Can you hear that? It's Democrats not promising to nullify/repeal Trump's #MuslimBan executive order.
Pence, Ryan, Mattis...all slammed #MuslimBan during campaign, all now supporting Trump implement it. Wonder why no trust in politicians?
We've lost something very precious. And traded it for a cowardly, foolish illusion of safety. I'm ashamed. #MuslimBan
The #MuslimBan is not about national security, its about White supremacy & the invented threats craven leaders use to justify its existence.

The chorus of criticism came as passport holders from Arab countries were blocked on Saturday from passing through customs at US airports and others were prevented from boarding US-bound planes.
Trump on Friday signed an executive order that will curb immigration and the entry of refugees from some Muslim-majority countries. He separately said he wanted the US to give priority to Syrian Christians fleeing the civil war there.
The bans, though temporary, took effect immediately, causing havoc and confusion for would-be travellers with passports from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen.
The United Nations refugee agency and the International Organization for Migration called on the Trump administration to continue offering asylum to people fleeing war and persecution, saying its resettlement programme was vital.
""The needs of refugees and migrants worldwide have never been greater and the US resettlement programme is one of the most important in the world,"" the two Geneva-based agencies said in a joint statement on Saturday.
Germany and France also expressed discontent with Trump's measures.
""The reception of refugees fleeing the war, fleeing oppression, is part of our duties,"" Jean-Marc Ayrault, France's foreign minister, said during a joint news conference with his German counterpart, Sigmar Gabriel.
Germany has taken in more than one million refugees and migrants, mainly from the Middle East, since 2015.
Although traditionally open to asylum seekers, France has taken in far fewer refugees than Germany since the migrant crisis erupted.

Some in the French government, particularly ex-premier Manuel Valls, have criticised Berlin's open-door policy, as has Trump.
""The United States is a country where Christian traditions have an important meaning. Loving your neighbour is a major Christian value, and that includes helping people,"" said Germany's Gabriel.
""I think that is what unites us in the West, and I think that is what we want to make clear to the Americans.""
Turkish Prime Minister Binali Yildirim also said the Republicans' sweeping ban on people seeking refuge in the US is no solution to problems.
""Regional issues cannot be solved by closing the doors on people,"" Yildirim said during a joint news conference in Ankara with Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May, adding that Western countries should do more to help ease Turkey's refugee burden.
May, however, refused to condemn Trump's refugee suspension.
""The United States is responsible for the United States' policy on refugees,"" she said when repeatedly pressed on the issue. But other European leaders made their concerns clear, with Luxembourg Foreign Minister Jean Asselborn condemning the new measures. ""The decision is ... bad for Europe, because it's going to strengthen even further the mistrust and hatred towards the West in the heart of the Muslim world,"" he told the Sunday edition of German daily Tagesspiegel, excerpts of which were released a day in advance.
Inside the US, Democrats were also quick to condemn Trump's order, saying it would tarnish the reputation of the country.
""Today's executive order from President Trump is more about extreme xenophobia than extreme vetting,"" said Democratic Senator Edward Markey in a statement.
Chuck Schumer, the New York senator, also criticised Trump's move, saying in a tweet:
There are tears running down the cheeks of the Statue of Liberty tonight. pic.twitter.com/X6q40dMCsN
Yet some Republicans praised Trump's move. Bob Goodlatte, chairman of the House of Representatives Judiciary Committee, said the US president ""is using the tools granted to him by Congress and the power granted by the Constitution to help keep America safe and ensure we know who is entering the United States"".
""What we have to remember in all of this is that there are millions of Americans who like what Trump is doing when he’s revamping immigration and the visiting to the US,"" Al Jazeera's Kimberly Halkett, reporting from Washington DC, said.
""It’s what he promised to do during the campaign trail and in his inauguration speech.""
Trump on Wednesday also ordered the construction of a US-Mexican border wall, a major promise during his election campaign, as part of a package of measures to curb undocumented immigration.
Ostensibly referring to Trump's executive order, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said in a speech on Saturday: ""Today is not the time to erect walls between nations. They have forgotten that the Berlin wall fell years ago.""

He added: ""Today is the time for peaceful co-existence, not the time to create distance among nations.""
But Milos Zeman, the president of the Czech Republic, praised the decision. Writing on Twitter, Zeman's spokesperson said Trump ""protects his country"" and called for the European Union to take similar measures.
Dutch politician Geert Wilders, known for promoting Islamophobia, tweeted: ""Well done @POTUS it's the only way to stay safe + free. I would do the same. Hope you'll add more Islamic countries like Saudi Arabia soon,"" using an acronym for the President of the United States.

One Syrian family that has found refuge in the US state of California urged Trump to reconsider the ban and said it was an insurmountable obstacle for many Syrians seeking safety.
Bill Dalati told Al Jazeera: ""My brothers-in-law and cousins are still there. They're dying and no one is taking them in.
""No food, no medicine, their homes have been bombed, their shelters have been bombed and they have nowhere to go. Where can they go?""

""I need to save them but they're not letting me.
""Every day I wake up and I'm afraid to pick up the phone and to hear 'Oh, you lost a brother', or 'Oh, you lost a sister', or 'You lost someone.' I can't do it any more.""
The order, which has drawn the ire of Democrats and civil rights groups, bans nationals of Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen from entering the US.
Despite none of the perpetrators of any major US attack coming from these majority-Muslim countries, the Trump administration insists that the order is not targeting Muslims.

On Friday, during an interview with the Christian Broadcasting Network, Trump said his administration would make helping persecuted Christians in the Middle East and North Africa a priority.
""They've been horribly treated,"" Trump said, referring to Christians.
""Everybody was persecuted in all fairness, but they were chopping off the heads of everybody, but more so the Christians, and I thought it was very, very unfair.""
The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL, or ISIS) group overran large swathes of Iraq and Syria in 2014, before attacking religious minorities including Christians and Yazidis.
However, the vast majority of the armed group's victims have been Muslim, particularly Shia Muslims, whom ISIL consider ""deviant"".

His remarks on Saturday came after Trump ordered the construction of a wall along the US-Mexico border and imposed tough new controls on travellers from seven Muslim countries, among them Iran.
""They have forgotten that the Berlin Wall collapsed many years ago. Even if there are walls between nations, they must be removed,"" Rouhani said at a tourism convention in Tehran.
Rouhani did not comment directly on the visa ban, but said Iran had ""opened its doors"" to foreign tourists since the signing of a nuclear agreement with world powers in 2015.
With more than a million Iranians living in the US, many families are deeply concerned about the implications of Trump's visa ban, which also affects citizens from Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen.
""To annul world trade accords does not help their economy and does not serve the development and blooming of the world economy,"" Rouhani said at the Tehran conference. ""This is the day for the world to get closer through trade.""
The protectionist-minded Trump formally withdrew the United States from the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal on Monday, fulfilling a campaign pledge to end American involvement in the 2015 pact.
On Thursday, one of Iran's most popular actresses said she would boycott next month's Academy Awards in protest at the ban.

No visas will be issued for migrants, refugees or visitors from the seven countries for at least 90 days, a restriction which can be extended if the countries in question do not provide extensive information on individuals seeking to enter the United States.
Quizzed on the street, many Iranians said they were baffled by the move.
""Americans themselves are mostly immigrants. To pick out a few countries and call them terrorist is not logical,"" Mohsen Najari, a 33-year-old resident of the Iranian capital, told the AFP news agency.

""The suit, which the plaintiff lodged seeking an apology and 60,000 crowns ($2,350) in compensation, was rejected,"" said Justice Daniela Cejkova, handing down the verdict in a Prague court on Friday.
Ayan Nuur filed a lawsuit against the school after she was not allowed to attend while wearing a headscarf.
The school argued that the young woman had never formally enrolled in the establishment. Ivanka Kohoutova, the school's principal, also argued that wearing a scarf covering the hair, ears and neck, and revealing only the face contravened its safety and hygiene standards.
Nuur, who was granted asylum in the Czech Republic in 2011, did not attend the trial, but was represented by her lawyer.

During the trial, a group of female students came in support of the school and its rules against the head covering, reported the Czech news agency, CTK.
A group of Muslims also came out in support of Nuur, the agency said.
The Czech Republic is a secular country of 10.5 million people, with a Muslim community of only 10,000 to 20,000 members. It has no law covering the wearing of religious garments.
But like elsewhere in Europe, anti-Muslim sentiment has been on the rise there following the 2015 refugee and migrant crisis when more than one million people, mostly refugees fleeing violence in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria, entered the EU.
Czech President Milos Zeman, known for his fiery anti-migrant rhetoric, insisted last year that it was ""practically impossible"" to integrate the Muslim community into European society.
Members of the public present in court on Friday sang the Czech national anthem and applauded after the verdict was handed down.

Farhadi won an Oscar in 2012 for his film A Separation.
Visa applications from Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen are all expected to be stopped for a month under a draft executive order published in the Washington Post and New York Times.

Garbage lines many of the narrow, rutted streets, symptoms of the lower level of government funding bestowed upon the town; unemployed men mill about, complaining that Israel’s policies have hurt the local economy.
Avigdor Lieberman, Israel’s hard-right foreign minister, has proposed annexing this and other Arab villages to a future Palestinian state. Their inhabitants would be stripped of their Israeli citizenship unless they were willing to leave their land and swear a “loyalty oath” to the state.
His plan is deeply unpopular here and in nearby villages. Despite the discrimination most Arabs experience in Israel, they say few will renounce their Israeli citizenship to become Palestinians.
""I’m here in this state now,"" said Jamil, the owner of a small bakery near one of the town's green-domed mosques. ""My family has been here since before 1948. I don’t want to go out to Palestine. I don’t like the wars, I have problems with the [Israeli] government, but a Palestinian state? No.""
Liberal Israeli commentators have denounced Lieberman’s plan as racist, but centrist and left-wing Israeli politicians have been more muted in their criticism, leading many Israeli Arabs to believe that their country’s political leadership tacitly supports Lieberman’s plan.
""He’s shouting what they are not saying,"" said Ihad Abu Mokh, a lifelong Baqa al-Gharbiyya resident, over coffee in a busy café earlier this month. ""They dream it. But they know this is the 21st century. We are not in the Dark Ages now.""
But The Palestine Papers reveal that Tzipi Livni, Israel's former foreign minister, did say it: During several 2008 meetings with Palestinian negotiators, Livni proposed annexing Arab villages to the future Palestinian state, forcing tens of thousands of Israeli Arabs to choose between their citizenship and their land.
Ali Abunimah: Obama shift on 1967 line opens door to Palestine population transfer
""The US position on borders perhaps unwittingly opens the door to dangerous Israeli ambitions to transfer -- or ethnically cleanse -- non-Jewish Palestinian citizens of Israel in order to create an ethnically pure 'Jewish state.'""
Her clearest language came on June 21, 2008 , when she told senior Palestinian negotiators Ahmed Qurei and Saeb Erekat that their land swaps should include Israeli Arab villages. Udi Dekel, a top adviser to the then-Israeli prime minister Ehud Olmert, rattled off a list of villages that would be annexed to Palestine.
Livni: We have this problem with Raja [Ghajar] in Lebanon. Terje Larsen put the blue line to cut the village in two. [This needs to be addressed.] We decided not to cut the village. It was a mistake. The problem now, those living on Lebanese soil are Israeli citizens.
Dekel: Barka, Barta il Sharqiya, Barta il [Garbiya], Betil, Beit Safafa…
Qurei: This will be difficult. All Arabs in Israel will be against us.
Becker: We will need to address it somehow. Divided. All Palestinian. All Israeli.
Two months earlier, in another meeting with Qurei and Erekat , Livni herself mentioned the same villages, describing them – their status in the state of Israel – as a problem in need of resolution.
Livni: Let us be fair. You referred to 1967 line. We have not talked about Jerusalem yet. There are some Palestinian villages that are located on both sides of the 1967 line about which we need to have an answer, such as Beit Safafa, Barta’a, Baqa al-Sharqiyeh and Baqa al-Gharbiyyeh.
Livni’s choice of words is striking. Beit Safafa, Barta’a and Baqa al-Gharbiyya all sit at least partly on the Israeli side of the Green Line; their inhabitants carry Israeli passports, pay taxes to the Israeli government, and overwhelmingly self-identify as Israelis.
But Livni describes them as Palestinians – and suggests that they do not belong in the state of Israel.
Baqa al-Gharbiyya used to be just Baqa, a name still used by many residents. The creation of the state of Israel split the village in half, with Baqa al-Gharbiyya on the west side of the 1948 armistice line and Baqa al-Sharqiyya on the east.
Livni has described the Palestinian state as a solution to the “national aspirations” of the Palestinian people, and she uses that term to include Israeli Arabs.
This was her language from a November 2007 meeting with the French foreign minister:
“The idea of creating a Palestinian state is to give a national answer to the Palestinians, wherever they are. Those who live in the territories, in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, those who live outside of the territories, whether they live in different refugee camps or in Israel – it’s the national answer to them.”
She was criticized for her comments; Israel’s popular Nana10 Web portal ran an opinion piece comparing her to Avigdor Lieberman. But she used similar language a year later, when she described a Palestinian state as “a national solution” for Israeli Arabs.
Livni quickly tried to clarify her comments, telling Israeli radio in December 2008 that “there is no question of carrying out a transfer of forcing them to leave.”
Residents regularly travelled back and forth between the two until six years ago, when the Israeli separation barrier was built. Several streets in the villages now dead-end at an eight-metre-high concrete wall topped with barbed wire.
Those who live in Baqa al-Gharbiyya face what they, and many Israeli and international human rights groups, describe as systemic prejudice. Israeli Arabs routinely face discrimination when applying for jobs, and their towns and villages often receive a lower level of government funding than Jewish communities.
In its 2009 report, the Association for Civil Rights in Israel described the discrimination faced by Arabs as ""open and explicit"", and warned that the government is threatening ""their most basic rights – to equality, education and employment – as well as their very citizenship"".
""Look around this village, you see the streets, the cars, the buildings, how it looks,” said Mustafa Fayoum, a resident of the Arab village of Jaljulia. “Compare it to Tel Aviv. You will see the difference.”
Yet Qurei was right when he said that Arabs in Israel would oppose a transfer to Palestine: In dozens of interviews on a visit earlier this month, only one Baqa al-Gharbiyya resident said he would prefer to live in a Palestinian state.
Asked why, many cited economic reasons; even the jobless thought their future prospects were better in Israel.
""Our circumstances here are better than there, even though here we don’t feel that we are in the community, or in the society of the Jewish people,"" said Bashar al-Alimi, an unemployed 38-year-old.
""It’s a difficult question,"" said Mounir Abu Hussain, a 34-year-old mechanic. ""But my job is here, the work is good here, and maybe it would be hard to go into a Palestinian state.""
""[Israel] is a Western country, it’s more developed, there are more options, less corruption,"" said Ismail Athmani, 34. ""And I was born in Israel. I’m not leaving.""
But the economy wasn’t the only reason why Baqa al-Gharbiyya residents said they prefer Israel to Palestine. Several described the West Bank as a police state, and said that – despite the discrimination they face – they prefer the level of political freedom in Israel.
""It’s bad in the West Bank. We have family there, we hear things. The police in Palestine, you can’t talk about politics unless you’re in the most closed-off place. Otherwise you die,"" Athmani said.
His friend Abu Mokh leaned across the table to interrupt him. ""Not die,"" he said with a rueful grin. ""You just disappear.""
Polls of Israeli Arabs over the last decade have consistently reached a similar finding: most would rather remain in Israel than live under Palestinian jurisdiction.
A December 2010 survey by the Brookings Institution found that 58 per cent of Israeli Arabs oppose the sorts of swaps proposed by Lieberman and Livni. The Jewish-Arab Relations Index, an annual publication from the University of Haifa, consistently finds majority support for that view (57 per cent in the most recent survey, in 2008). Similarly, a 2000 poll of Umm al-Fahm residents found that 83 per cent want their city to remain Israeli.
Many families in these villages have lived in Israel since before 1948 – before there was a state of Israel, in other words. One man described himself as ""more Israeli than Lieberman,"" referring to the Soviet Union-born foreign minister who immigrated to Israel at the age of 20.
""Netanyahu cannot take me and tell me, ‘you are living here,’"" Fayoum said. ""I am Israeli, only Israeli.""
PA proposed that only a handful of the nearly 6 million Palestinian refugees be allowed to return.

The study published on Tuesday by the Refugee Rights Data Project (RRDP) found that women were exposed to dangers including gender-based violence, abuse by authorities, and sexual harassment.
Researchers from the UK-based organisation spoke to more than 300 refugees and aid workers in nine camps and residences late last year.
They found incidences of rape, forced prostitution, forced marriage, and trafficking, with younger refugees particularly affected.
Perpetrators included fellow refugees and volunteers, the study said.
An NGO worker interviewed said that at one informal camp in Athens, virtually no security measures existed to protect women, who were at ""constant risk"" of sexual violence.
The camps are run by the Greek government and local NGOs, but some are informal and run by refugees themselves.
READ MORE: Refugees in Greece work together and build communities
More than 46 percent of women told researchers that they did not feel safe living in the camps, and 69 percent said they lived in dwellings that did not have a secure lock.
Many said they were afraid to go to toilets at night, because poor lighting in the camps made them vulnerable to attack.
""I am afraid of the snakes and the rats, the wild pigs ... I am afraid of some of the people,"" one woman told the researchers.
Marta Welander, RRDP director, told Al Jazeera that European governments should help survivors of abuse and ensure that appropriate measures are put in place to protect refugees in the first place.
“[The report] exposes a critical absence of adequate medical and psychosocial support for survivors of sexual and gender-based violence, and highlights the need for dedicated 'safe spaces' within all camps,"" she said.
""It is entirely unacceptable that Europe is failing to provide adequate protection and meet minimum standards for vulnerable women and girls.""
READ MORE: Female refugees face sexual exploitation in Greece
Roland Schoenbauer, a spokesperson for the UNHCR, which provides assistance on the ground to refugees, said the organisation was concerned at reports of sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV) in Greece.
""Whenever such reports occur, authorities should proceed with an immediate and thorough investigation,"" he said.
""SGBV is closely linked to substandard living conditions in areas accommodating refugees. Many sites were not set up to prevent or respond to such risks, contributing to the increase of risk and vulnerability,"" he explained further.
Schoenbauer said local authorities should take ""bold action"" to prevent such incidents and called for further training to help support workers counsel survivors of abuse.
""UNHCR and partners have developed initiatives such as the Blue Dots to provide a single point for referral to appropriate service providers, safe spaces for women and children, and access to medical and legal services,"" he said.
In addition to safety, more than three-quarters of the women interviewed said they had experienced health problems since arriving at the camps, with a majority attributing their conditions to the physical and mental strains of living in them.
About 95 percent of women said they had experienced depression, with half saying they felt depressed all the time, according to the RRDP study.
The NGO said residents of the camps lived in unsanitary conditions without access to necessary reproductive health services.
Roughly a quarter of the residents said they did not know where to access services if they became pregnant and 88 percent said they did not where to obtain contraceptives.
After northern European and Balkan states closed off their borders to stop refugees entering their countries, many live in makeshift and formal settlements in Greece, the first EU country they enter.
Their presence has stoked anger from the far-right and left them vulnerable to criminals.
The refugees are mainly concentrated near the Macedonian border and in Athens.
More than 173,000 people arrived in Greece as refugees in 2016, according to the UNHCR.

In an hour-long interview with Spanish newspaper El Pais, conducted as Donald Trump was being sworn in as US president, the pontiff also condemned the idea of using walls and barbed wire to keep out foreigners, among them refugees and migrants.
""Of course, crises provoke fears and worries,"" he said, but added that for him ""the example of populism in the European sense of the word is Germany in 1933"".
The pope added: ""Germany ... was looking for a leader, someone who would give her back her identity and there was a little man named Adolf Hitler who said 'I can do it'.""
""Hitler did not steal power,"" the pope said. ""He was elected by his people and then he destroyed his people.""
The Germans at that time also wanted to protect themselves with ""walls and barbed wire so that others cannot take away their identity"", he said.
""The case of Germany is classic,"" he said, adding that Hitler gave them a ""deformed identity and we know what it produced"".
Pope Francis, however, underlined that it was too early to pass judgment on Trump.
""Let's see. Let's see what he does and then we will evaluate,"" he said.
In February, the pontiff, in another apparent warning to Trump, said: ""A person who thinks only about building walls - wherever they may be - and not building bridges, is not Christian ... I'd just say that this man is not Christian, if he said it this way.""
Populist parties are on the rise across Europe.
Unemployment and austerity, the arrival of record numbers of refugees and migrants in France, Belgium and Germany have left voters disillusioned with conventional parties and led to a rise of Islamophobic sentiment and anti-refugee views.
In Germany, far-right leaders met at a conference amid protests a day earlier.
French far-right leader, Marine Le Pen, told several hundred supporters in the German city of Koblenz that Britain's vote last year to leave the European Union would create a ""domino effect"".
A day after Trump took office in the US, Le Pen said his inauguration speech included ""accents in common"" with the message of reclaiming national sovereignty by the far-right leaders.
""2016 was the year the Anglo-Saxon world woke up. I am sure 2017 will be the year the people of continental Europe wake up,"" she said to loud applause.
Le Pen - head of the anti-European Union, anti-immigrant National Front and seen by pollsters as highly likely to make a two-person runoff vote for the French presidency in May - has marked out Europe as a major plank in her programme.
More than 3,000 demonstrators gathered to protest against the Koblenz conference, while some staged a sit-in outside the hall.
Also in attendance was Dutch hardliner Geert Wilders, who used the platform to repeat Islamophobic rhetoric, the central theme of policies that have pushed his Party for Freedom to the front in the polls in the run-up to elections in March.
The leaders of Europe's established parties were ""promoting our Islamisation"", Wilders said in a speech.
European women were now ""frightened of showing their blonde hair"", the Dutch politician said, addressing the enthusiastic audience in German.

The longtime ruler refused to step down after a December 1 vote in which opposition leader Adama Barrow was declared the winner, triggering weeks of tension as West African leaders threatened to use military force to oust him if he failed to step down.
Jammeh boarded a small, unmarked plane at an airport in the capital, Banjul, late on Saturday, alongside Guinea's President Alpha Conde after two days of negotiations over a departure deal. He landed in Conakry, Guinea's capital, but set off again for Equatorial Guinea, where he will remain in exile, the president of the Economic Community Of West African States (ECOWAS), Marcel Alain de Souza, told journalists
""No legislative measures"" would be taken that would infringe the ""dignity, security, safety and rights"" of Jammeh or his family, ECOWAS said in a joint declaration with the African Union and United Nations. Jammeh could return to The Gambia when he pleased, the statement added, and property ""lawfully"" belonging to him would not be seized.

""The agreement essentially says there can be no prosecution against Jammeh, his family or his entourage; there will be no seizure of his assets, no witch-hunts, and he can be back to the country at any time, "" Al Jazeera's Nicolas Haque, reporting from Dakar in neighbouring Senegal, said.
""It might sound like a good deal for Jammeh, but we have to bear in mind that this is a political document, not a legally binding one, so it still brings hopes for those wanting to prosecute Jammeh or those in the security services over alleged human rights violations.""
Human rights activists have repeatedly demanded that Jammeh be held accountable for alleged abuses, including torture and detention of opponents.
Scenes of jubilation broke out almost immediately on streets near Banjul, after the news filtered out that Jammeh had gone. ""We are free now. We are no longer in prison,"" Fatou Cham, 28, told AFP news agency.

""We do not have to watch our back before we express our opinions.""
Al Jazeera's Haque said Jammeh's departure marked a ""historic moment"" for people in The Gambia and West Africa who believe that there can be democracy in the region.
""This was done by the votes of young Gambians who took to the street, who cast their ballot box and really got Jammeh out of power despite him not wanting to let go,"" our correspondent said.
""It was a peaceful protest that was done in Gambia and also on social media, and it was just too much for Jammeh to ignore.""
Barrow, who was sworn in as The Gambia's new president at the country's embassy in Senegal on Thursday, is expected to return home imminently.
Speaking to the Associated Press on Saturday, Barrow urged caution after an online petition called for Jammeh to be arrested, and not be granted asylum.
The new president, who had sought shelter in the neighbouring country, said he favours launching a ""truth and reconciliation commission"" to investigate possible crimes by Jammeh.

ECOWAS had pledged to remove Jammeh by force if he did not step down. The group assembled a multinational military force, including tanks, that rolled into The Gambia on Thursday.
The troops moved in after Barrow's inauguration and a unanimous vote by the UN Security Council backing the new president and calling Jammeh to cede power.
Jammeh announced his intention to leave the country on Friday. ""I have decided in good conscience to relinquish the mantle of leadership of this great nation,"" he said.
At least 46,000 people had fled The Gambia for Senegal since the start of the crisis fearing unrest, according to the UN's refugee agency.

The camp is home to displaced civilians and to rebel groups that fight both President Bashar al-Assad and the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL, also known as ISIS) armed group, and was targeted by bombings last year.
Jordan's official Petra news agency, citing a military source, confirmed that an explosion went off inside the camp.
Syrian local media said the blast was caused by a car bomb and caused deaths and injuries.
There was no claim of responsibility for the bombing.
Home to more than 85,000 displaced people, the Rakban camp was also targeted by a bomb blast last month.
On Saturday, the Russian defence ministry said six Russian warplanes carried out air strikes on ISIL targets in the Deir Ezzor province, according to Russian media outlet RIA.
The ministry added that the planes flew from Russian territory and returned after the strikes, RIA said.
The attacks come as the Syrian government and rebel groups prepare for upcoming peace talks in Kazakhstan.
A ceasefire brokered by Russia and Turkey last month excluded the main hardline group in northwestern Syria, former al-Qaeda affiliate Jabhat Fateh al-Sham. Meanwhile a spate of air strikes targeting its leaders have increased mistrust among rebels.

All this plays further to Assad's advantage, as his Russian and Iranian allies want to lead diplomacy over Syria, with new US President Donald Trump indicating that he will cut backing for the moderate Syrian opposition.
The rebels going to Kazakhstan's Astana say the meeting must focus on shoring up the ceasefire and that they will resist political discussions. Assad has said he is open to such talks.
Syria's conflict started as a largely unarmed uprising against Assad's rule in March 2011, but it quickly morphed into a full-scale civil war.
Hundreds of thousands of people have been killed throughout the five years of fighting, while more than half of the country's prewar population have been internally displaced or fled the country.

More than 3,000 demonstrators gathered, while some staged a sit-in outside the hall. They shouted slogans such as ""no border, no nation, stop deportation"".
More than 1,000 police officers were deployed in the city before the demonstrations.
Not far away, demonstrators from the global Avaaz activist group placed statues of Adolf Hitler, Benito Mussolini and Josef Stalin, among others, in front of a landmark statue of German Kaiser Wilhelm.
Speaking to Associated Press, Avaaz organiser Pascal Vollenweider said the statues were meant to send a ""strong message"" to the nationalist politicians meeting that ""global citizens are rejecting their old dangerous ideas"".
German Social Democratic Party leader Sigmar Gabriel was among those protesting, reported German daily Deutsche Welle.
German Green Party co-chairwoman Simone Peter and Luxembourg's Foreign Minister Jean Asselborn were also scheduled to participate, the newspaper added.
Inside the conference, far-right leaders were bullish about their parties' prospects.
""We are seeing the end of one world and the birth of a new,"" the leader of France's National Front, Marine Le Pen, told supporters of right-wing and anti-immigrant parties.
Le Pen was critical of German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who received broad praise for her decision to allow hundreds of thousands of refugees and migrants into the country in 2015.
""But no one asked the Germans what they think of this immigration policy,"" Le Pen said at her first public appearance in Germany.
Merkel is now under pressure as frustration grows among voters who have criticised her management of the refugee crisis.

The French presidential hopeful described 2017 as ""the year of awakening for the people of Central Europe"".
European nationalists were no longer on the fringe and would now set out to win majorities in elections this year in the Netherlands, France and Germany, she added.
Le Pen has been quick to claim recent anti-establishment victories by President Donald Trump and the Brexit campaign as those of a rising populist right in Europe.
Speaking to Al Jazeera from Berlin, European policy analyst Nina Schick said far-right leaders were attempting to portray themselves as a ""unified front"" in 2017.
""The first thing to point out is that it's certainly no coincidence that they're meeting here today in Germany one day after the inauguration of Donald Trump,"" she explained, referring to the new right-wing US president.
""They want to show themselves as being part of this global anti-establishment backlash and that they are somehow the true democratic voices and representatives of the people,"" Schick said. ""This is the same kind of rhetoric we saw not only in Trump's election campaign but also in the Brexit campaign.""
Dutch firebrand Geert Wilders used the platform to repeat his Islamophobic rhetoric, the central theme of policies that have pushed his Party for Freedom to the front in the polls in the run-up to elections in March.

Alterantive for Deutschland leader Frauke Petry, whose party is set to enter Germany's Bundestag for the first time this year, accused the German and European Union governments of threatening individual and cultural freedom through ""brainwashing"", which she claimed was ""much worse than erstwhile socialist propaganda"".
In February 2016, Petry was criticised for her violent rhetoric after she called on German police to shoot refugees and migrants in order to ""prevent illegal border crossings"".
Meanwhile, Matteo Salvini, leader of the far-right Northern League in Italy, called for withdrawal from the euro, which he called a ""failed, criminal experiment"".
Hammering on an anti-immigrant theme that has seen the party rise in recent months to around 15 percent electoral support in Italy, Salvini said: ""There are thousands of Italians without homes, electricity or heating, while thousands of immigrants are living in hotels.""
OPINION: Welcome to the world of Europe's far-right
He also slammed Merkel's migration policies and claimed that Europe's leaders were furthering ""terrorism"" by taking in refugees.
The conference was organised by the Europe of Nations and Freedom (ENF), a cross-party group in the European Parliament made up of Eurosceptics and anti-migrant movements from across the bloc.
The ENF had already attracted criticism before Saturday's gathering because organisers blocked press access for several media outlets, citing alleged bias.
Before Saturday's conference, left-wing politician Katarina Barley, general secretary of Germany's Social Democratic Party, called for progressives to unite against growing right-wing populism in Europe.
Speaking to the Neue Osnabrucker Zeitung newspaper, Barley described the rise of far-right movements as ""terrifying"".
""These people think that each country should have only its own interests in view, even at someone else's expense,"" she said. ""Such an ideology leads in the long run to wars.""

""We aren't talking about prosecution here, we are talking about getting a truth and reconciliation commission,"" Barrow told the AP. ""Before you can act, you have to get the truth, to get the facts together.""
Jammeh, who first seized power in a 1994 coup, has been holed up this week in his official residence in Banjul, increasingly isolated as he was abandoned by his security forces and several cabinet members.
Since losing the election to Barrow in January, Jammeh had for weeks refused to hand over power.
Barrow has been in Senegal for his safety during a political standoff that came to the brink of a regional military intervention.
Under heavy security, Barrow took the presidential oath of office Thursday at The Gambia's embassy in Dakar, with the backing of the international community.
Jammeh finally prepared to leave the country after declaring on Friday he would do so.
""I have decided in good conscience to relinquish the mantle of leadership of this great nation,"" Jammeh said.
Human rights activists demanded that Jammeh be held accountable for alleged abuses, including torture and detention of opponents.
It was those concerns about prosecution that led Jammeh to challenge the December election results.
At least 46,000 people have fled The Gambia for Senegal since the start of the crisis fearing unrest, the UN's refugee agency UNHCR said, citing Senegalese government figures.
The West African regional bloc, ECOWAS, pledged to remove Jammeh by force if he did not step down. The group assembled a multinational military force including tanks that rolled into The Gambia on Thursday.
The force moved in after Barrow's inauguration and a unanimous vote by the UN Security Council supporting the regional efforts.
Barrow said he will return to his homeland after the outgoing president leaves.
Writing on Twitter on Saturday from Senegal, Barrow said: ""As Yahya Jammeh officially stepped down from office - I will be returning to my homeland, the Republic of The Gambia. #NewGambia.""
As Yahya Jammeh officially stepped down from office — I will be returning to my homeland, the Republic of The Gambia. #NewGambia
Jammeh is expected to leave soon for Guinea, reports said.
Barrow said he will enter The Gambia once a security sweep has been completed.
""It is not yet confirmed information, but reliable sources say he'll be leaving today,"" Barrow told AP. ""We believe he'll go to Guinea, but we are yet to confirm 100 percent, but that's what we believe.""
In the Guinea capital, Conakry, the security minister was at the airport with Jeeps full of well-armed military personnel, witnesses said.
However, a special plane also landed from Malabo, the capital of Equatorial Guinea, with only a crew and no passengers, suggesting that could be Jammeh's final destination. Equatorial Guinea, unlike Guinea, is not a state party to the International Criminal Court.
The new Gambian president said he had not yet been given the communique that should spell out the terms of Jammeh's departure.
""What is fundamental here is he will live in a foreign country as of now,"" he said.

""I have decided today in good conscience to relinquish the mantle of leadership of this great nation with infinite gratitude to all Gambians,"" he said in a statement broadcast on state television early on Saturday.
The announcement came after hours of last-ditch talks with regional leaders and the threat by a regional military force to make him leave.
The new president, Adama Barrow, had earlier declared that ""the rule of fear"" was over and that Jammeh, who ruled the country for 22 years, had agreed to leave.
I would like to inform you that Yahya Jammeh has agreed to step down. He is scheduled to depart Gambia today. #NewGambia
Barrow was sworn in at Gambia's embassy in Dakar in neighbouring Senegal on Thursday.
A State House official close to the situation told the AFP news agency that Jammeh would leave within three days, possibly on Saturday with Alpha Conde, president of Guinea, who had travelled to Gambia's capital, Banjul, for negotiations.
Earlier on Friday, Gambia's Chief of Defence Forces, Ousmane Badjie, pledged his allegiance to the country's new president, a major shift as mediation continued to persuade Jammeh to cede power.
Jammeh had rejected Barrow's December 1 election win, despite significant pressure from regional powers and the UN, sparking a major crisis.
READ MORE: Is Gambia on a path to turmoil?
At least 46,000 people have fled Gambia for Senegal since the start of the crisis fearing unrest, the UN's refugee agency UNHCR said, citing Senegalese government figures.
Celebrations erupted in Banjul, where tensions have run high especially since the declaration of a state of emergency by Jammeh made on Tuesday.
Barrow, a real estate agent turned politician, had flown into Senegal on January 15 to seek shelter after weeks of rising tension over Jammeh's stance.
West African troops had entered the country to bolster the new president, but military operations were suspended in favour of a final diplomatic push to convince Jammeh to exit peacefully.
In an interview with Al Jazeera, Barrow said that he hoped the 15-nation Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) could find him a safe haven.
Jammeh started negotiations with ECOWAS on Thursday. He demanded an amnesty for any crimes that he may have committed during his more than two decades in power and that he be permitted to stay in Gambia, at his home village of Kanilai.
Those demands were not acceptable, said Marcel Alain de Souza, head of ECOWAS.
Jammeh's continued presence in Gambia would ""create disturbances to public order and terrorist movements"", he said.
Al Jazeera's Nicolas Haque, reporting from Dakar, said: ""A stable Gambia, Barrow told me, has to be without Jammeh in the picture. That's why this news is quite significant for all those that have left the country - 46,000 since January 1 ... They hope he leaves so they can come back.""

In a statement, Senegal's army said on Thursday that forces from ECOWAS, West Africa's regional bloc, had begun strikes as part of an operation aimed at upholding the result of last month's vote.
Colonel Abdou Ndiaye did not specify the type of strikes, but said ""significant"" land, air and sea resources had been made available .
Earlier on Thursday, Barrow, who had recently sought shelter in Senegal, took the oath of office in a hastily arranged ceremony at Gambia's embassy in the Senegalese capital, Dakar.
""This is a day no Gambian will ever forget in a lifetime,"" Barrow said in a speech immediately after being sworn in.
Not long after his inauguration, the United Nations Security Council unanimously adopted a resolution backing Barrow and called for a peaceful transfer of power.
""The people of The Gambia spoke clearly at the elections in December. They chose Adama Barrow to be their president. Their voice now needs to be heard and their will needs to be heeded by just one man,"" Peter Wilson, the UK deputy ambassador to the UN, said.
Earlier this week, Jammeh had declared a national state of emergency , while the parliament extended his term in office by 90 days. He has not been heard from since his mandate expired at midnight.
At least 26,000 people have fled Gambia for Senegal since the start of the crisis fearing unrest, the UN's refugee agency UNHCR said on Wednesday, citing Senegalese government figures.
In Dakar, the small embassy room held about 40 people, including Senegal's prime minister, the head of Gambia's electoral commission and officials from ECOWAS.
In his inauguration speech, Barrow called ECOWAS, the African Union and UN to ""support the government and people of the Gambia in enforcing their will"".
He also ordered Gambia's armed forces to remain in their barracks and called for ""allegiance to the motherland"".
Al Jazeera's Nicolas Haque, reporting from Dakar, said large crowds of young people had gathered outside the embassy shouting ""freedom"" and ""hope"".
""People who have spent their entire life under one leadership, one person, and they see in Barrow an opportunity for change"".
Haque added, however, that the ""situation is still precarious. As we understand, Jammeh is not ready to let go of Gambia; he is still in charge at least in the capital, Banjul.""
Hundreds of West African soldiers had previously deployed to the Gambian border to back Barrow in a showdown with Jammeh.

Senegal's army had said on Wednesday that it would be ready to cross into its smaller neighbour, which it surrounds, from midnight.
""A military operation [is under way] with troops also from Ghana, Nigeria, Togo, Mali - they are all at the Senegal border and presenting a united front,"" Haque said earlier on Thursday .
Also on Thursday, sources told Al Jazeera that Isatou Njie-Saidy, Gambia's vice president since 1997, had quit, becoming the highest level official to abandon Jammeh's camp.
Haque said Saidy's resignation had come after a series of defections among Jammeh’s entourage.
""Eight cabinet members have resigned saying they no longer stand with Jammeh. But despite all these defections, Jammeh is still not willing to leave office,"" he said.
Jammeh, whose mandate expired at midnight, had initially conceded defeat but a week later contested the poll's results stating irregularities.

Jammeh has resisted strong international pressure for him to step down, but African nations have begun stepping away from him, with Botswana announcing on Thursday that it no longer recognised him as Gambia's president.
Jammeh's refusal to hand over power ""undermines the ongoing efforts to consolidate democracy and good governance"" in the Gambia and Africa in general, it said.
Earlier this month, the African Union announced that it would no longer recognise Jammeh once his mandate expired.

ICRC said on Wednesday that six Nigeria Red Cross members were among the dead and 13 more were wounded in Tuesday's incident in Rann, in the far north of Borno state.
""In addition to aid staff, it is estimated that 70 people have been killed and more than a 100 wounded,"" ICRC said in a statement.
Aid group Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) has said 52 were killed and 120 were wounded in the incident.
The air force has said an unknown number of civilians were killed and wounded in the mistaken attack, which was aimed at the Boko Haram group.
Lai Mohammed, Nigeria's information minister, said ""the accidental bombing is not a true reflection of the level of professionalism"" he had witnessed in the air force.
Lucky Irabor, who is the theatre commander for anti-Boko Haram operations in northeast Nigeria, said the air force would not deliberately target civilians, but there will be an investigation.
Al Jazeera's Ahmed Idris, reporting from Nigeria's capital, Abuja, said: ""Senior military officials say an investigation will be launched to find out exactly what happened, if there was any mistake on the part of the pilot or those conducting the operation.""
WATCH: Has Boko Haram been defeated?
The air strike followed a military offensive against Boko Haram in the last few weeks.
Borno state has been the centre of Boko Haram's seven-year-long attempt to create a caliphate in the northeast.
At least 20,000 people have been killed in the Boko Haram conflict since it began in 2009 and more than 2.6 million others made homeless.
Nigeria maintains the armed rebellion is in its final stages.
Last month, the government said it had flushed out Boko Haram fighters from their stronghold in the Sambisa Forest area of Borno state, of which Maiduguri is the capital.
Yet there has been no let-up in attacks both on troops and civilians.

Yiannis Lagos, an MP with the Golden Dawn far-right outfit, and other party members hurled abuse and acted with aggressive behaviour towards teachers at the state-run elementary school in Perama, Greece's education ministry said in a statement on Tuesday.
""Today's acts by the Golden Dawn members ... will not affect the operation of the school for the refugee children,"" said Yiannis Pantis, the ministry's general secretary.
""Instances of violence and racism have no place in a school environment.""
Golden Dawn, an anti-immigrant party, is the third biggest political player in Greece, a country still struggling after more than six years of deepening recession.
The party has taken advantage of a protest vote against domestic political failures and internationally imposed austerity, polling just 0.3 percent in 2009 to winning almost seven percent in the country's last general election in 2015.
Many of its MPs, including Lagos, and other party members are facing trial on charges that Golden Dawn is run as a criminal organisation.
They have now been freed after the expiration of an 18-month imprisonment period without trial.
The Golden Dawn members entered the school during a meeting between local officials, teachers and parents who were scheduled to discuss plans to offer after school classes to 25 refugee children who live in a nearby camp.
After storming the school, the Golden Dawn members threatened those attending the meeting and punched some teachers and parents, according to Greek media reports.
Witnesses also alleged that police stood outside the school, but failed to act to prevent the attack.
""Today's attack by Golden Dawn against parents and teachers in Perama, led by indicted MP Lagos, is a provocation for the entire Greek society,"" Takis Giannopoulos, a member of the Greek activist group Anti-Nazi Zone, told Al Jazeera.
""Golden Dawn denies education to 25 children who escaped war.
""This fascism cannot be tolerated.""
The attack was also condemned by several Greek political parties.
An estimated 62,000 refugees and migrants are currently stranded in Greece following a wave of border closures across Europe after a controversial agreement between the European Union and Turkey in March 2016.

The incident occurred on Tuesday at about 9am local time (08:00 GMT) in Rann, in the far north of Borno state, the epicentre of Boko Haram's armed campaign, as humanitarian workers distributed food to civilians.
Nigeria's air force said a fighter jet was on a mission against Boko Haram fighters when it accidentally struck the camp and killed an unknown number of refugees and aid workers.
But in a statement, aid group Doctors Without Borders (MSF) said the strike had killed at least 50 people and wounded 120.
MSF and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) were operating at the camp when it was hit.
The ICRC said via Twitter that six of the dead and 12 of the wounded were working for the Nigeria Red Cross.
A senior military source in the Borno state capital, Maiduguri, told AFP news agency the casualties were ""huge"", adding: ""A fighter jet hit the wrong target.""
Nigerian military commander, Lucky Irabor said the accidental bombardment killed ""some"" civilians and wounded aid workers, including some Nigerians working for MSF and ICRC.
He said two soldiers were wounded, but he did not have a final toll.
Irabor said he ordered the mission going on geographic coordinates for an alleged gathering of Boko Haram fighters. It was too early to say if a tactical error was made, he said.
INSIDE STORY: Has Boko Haram been defeated? (24:59)
The general, who is the theatre commander for anti-Boko Haram operations in northeast Nigeria, said the air force would not deliberately target civilians, but there will be an investigation.
""Senior military officials say an investigation will be launched to find out exactly what happened, if there was any mistake on the part of the pilot or those conducting the operation,"" Al Jazeera's Ahmed Idris, reporting from Nigeria's capital, Abuja, said.
France-based MSF said its workers were trying to provide emergency first aid at its facility in the camp and were stabilising patients to evacuate the wounded from the scene.
""Our medical and surgical teams in Cameroon and Chad are ready to treat wounded patients. We are in close contact with our teams, who are in shock following the event,"" it added.
INTERACTIVE MAP: Boko Haram attacks
Manji Cheto, a security analyst, told Al Jazeera that despite recent improvements in the fight against Boko Haram, the latest incident ""reaffirms the fact that Nigeria still has so much way to go in terms of boosting the intelligence capacity of its security forces in dealing with this.
""The timing is rather unfortunate as well because this is coming on the back of the government actually facing a lot of criticism for doing too little for the internally displaced camps.""
The war between Boko Haram and the Nigerian government has killed more than 20,000 people in the past six years. Some two million have also been forced to flee their homes, many of whom have moved to camps because it has been too dangerous to return home.
The air strike came amid an offensive against the armed group by Nigeria's military over the last few weeks.
President Muhammadu Buhari said last month a key camp in the group's Sambisa Forest base in Borno state had fallen.

The discussions, scheduled for January 23, intend to build on a nationwide ceasefire that has largely held despite escalating violence across several battlefronts in recent days.
Mohammad Alloush, a leading figure in the Jaish al-Islam group, said on Monday he would head the rebel delegation to the meeting.
He said the rebels were going to the talks to ""neutralise the criminal role"" of Iran in Syria's conflict.
""All the rebel groups are going [to Astana]. Everyone has agreed,"" Alloush told AFP news agency. ""Astana is a process to end the bloodletting by the regime and its allies. We want to end this series of crimes.""
The rebel factions' decision to send a delegation to the Astana talks came after five days of negotiations in Turkey's capital, Ankara.
The High Negotiations Committee, Syria's main opposition bloc, had also said previously that it would extend its support to an anti-government military delegation attending the talks.
But Shaam Network, an opposition news website, reported on Monday that a number of other rebel groups, including Ahrar al-Sham, one of the main fighting forces on the ground, had decided to stay away from the upcoming talks.
""At this point in time, six years into this war, the different brigades still cannot speak with one voice when it comes to Syria,"" Al Jazeera's Stefanie Dekker, reporting from the Nizip refugee camp in Turkey, said.
OPINION: Whitewashing Assad and his allies must be challenged
President Bashar al-Assad of Syria has already said his government is ready to attend the Astana meeting and ""discuss everything"".
The participating factions said on Monday the talks will only focus on reinforcing the current truce and look at humanitarian issues; a possible political solution to the crisis will not be on the agenda.
Zakaria Malahifji, of the Fastaqim rebel group, said: ""The majority of the groups decided to attend. Discussions will be on the ceasefire [and] the humanitarian issues - aid deliveries, release of detainees.""
The Astana meeting is organised by Russia and Turkey - two countries that have backed opposing sides of Syria's conflict for years, but have worked closely in recent weeks to end the bloodshed.
An official in a Free Syrian Army rebel group that agreed to participate in the talks told Reuters news agency on Monday the meeting would ""be a test for the Russians as the guarantor"".
He declined to be identified because the rebel groups had yet to appoint a spokesman.
If the Astana meetings are successful, they could bode well for the fate of fresh UN-hosted negotiations on the conflict next month in Switzerland's Geneva.
Several rounds of peace talks held by the UN have failed to produce a political solution to the conflict.
""We know the Astana talks are not going to be easy,"" said Al Jazeera's Dekker.
""Many of these groups did not want to attend them at all - certainly the political opposition, which has always said ... the talks need to be seen as a stepping stone for the UN-sponsored talks in Geneva.""
The truce, which began in Syria on December 30, to pave the way for the new peace talks, excludes the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) group and Jabhat Fateh al-Sham, which changed its name from al-Nusra Front after breaking ties with al-Qaeda last year.
Russia, Assad's most powerful ally, set the new diplomatic effort in motion after Syrian rebels suffered a major defeat last month by losing the rebel-held districts of eastern Aleppo.
Mevlut Cavusoglu, Turkey's foreign minister, said on Saturday that Turkey and Russia had decided to invite the US to attend the Astana meeting.

However, a Kremlin spokesman did not confirm that on Monday.
As with last year's peace talks, powerful Kurdish groups that control wide areas of northern Syria are being excluded from the talks in line with the wishes of Turkey.
Syria has been engulfed by violence since widespread protests in March 2011 calling for Assad's removal.
More than 310,000 people have been killed and over half the population has been forced to flee.

Al Jazeera also learned on Sunday that Lee was only allowed to speak to individuals who were preapproved by the government while she visited Muslim Rohingya villages in the area.
""These are things that will certainly hamper her investigation,"" Al Jazeera's Florence Looi, reporting from Sittwe, said. ""Lack of access will make her job more difficult.""
As part of her 12-day visit to Myanmar, Lee is spending three days in Rakhine - home to around 1.2 million stateless Rohingya, a Muslim minority that has suffered decades of poverty and repression, and been denied basic rights, such as citizenship and freedom of movement.
READ MORE: Global leaders warn Aung San Suu Kyi over Rohingya
Lee also visited the border guard posts, attacked in October, as well as a prison.
Northern Rakhine has been under strict military lockdown since October 9, when a gang killed nine border police officials near the border with Bangladesh, leading to a clampdown that has left anywhere between 84 and 400 Rohingya dead.
According to the UN, at least 65,000 Rohingya have reportedly fled across the border to Bangladesh to escape violence allegedly committed by the military, including the burning of homes, rape and murder of civilians.
The Myanmar government and military have denied all the allegations.
On Friday, Lee met Muslim community leaders during her visit to a Rohingya neighbourhood in Sittwe.
Lee also visited border guard posts, the attacks on which in early October triggered clearance operations by the military.
But a powerful ethnic party rejected a request for a meeting with Lee on Friday evening.
""We are not meeting her because we don't believe she and her organisation [the UN] have a will to resolve the issues fairly,"" Ba Swe, joint secretary of the Arakan National Party, told Anadolu Agency on Saturday.
""The issues will never be solved as long as they accept these Bengalis as members of this country's ethnic groups,"" Ba Swe said, using a term that suggests Rohingya are illegal immigrants from neighbouring Bangladesh.
The crisis in Myanmar has put Aung San Suu Kyi's administration under international pressure, with rights watchdog Human Rights Watch criticising the government of the Nobel Peace Prize laureate for failing to hold the country's military accountable for the crackdown on Rohingya.
Lee continues her travels through the conflict zone on Sunday before returning to Yangon later in the week.
Al Jazeera's Looi also said the UN envoy will also look into reports that the flow of aid to the Rohingya has been ""severely curtailed"" since the military operation began three months ago.
""The UN said they are concerned about the rising rate of malnutrition among the Rohingya in this area, because this is an area where food security is already in doubt,"" Looi said, adding that as many as 150,000 people are dependent on aid.
Across the border in Bangladesh, Al Jazeera's Maher Sattar, who is reporting from Cox's Bazar, said Rohingya refugees have also corroborated reports of abuse.
""We've come across people, who have been shot. We've come across children. Every single person here, they are quite unanimous in their stories of villages being burned and relatives being killed.""
A law passed in Myanmar in 1982 denies Rohingya - many of whom have lived in Myanmar for generations - citizenship, making them stateless.
The law denies Rohingya rights to Myanmar nationality, removes their freedom of movement, access to education and services, and allows arbitrary confiscation of property.
Rohingya have fled Myanmar in droves for decades, with a new wave of migrations occurring since mid-2012 after communal violence broke out.
Because of their lack of citizenship, they are also considered as refugees in Bangladesh, and many of them are confined in refugee camps for decades.

Anas Modamani, a 19-year-old refugee from Damascus, was pictured in September 2015 taking a selfie with Merkel during her visit to a refugee shelter in Berlin's Spandau district.
The image came to define Germany's response to the refugee crisis, when Merkel opened the country's borders to hundreds of thousands of asylum seekers.
But, in the following months, Modamani's image was shared on Facebook on a series of anonymous accounts, alongside posts claiming he was responsible for attacks and murder, including the Brussels Airport bombing of March 2016.
Who wouldn't take a selfie with Angela Merkel, Germany's Angel of Death? #BerlinAnschlag #BerlinAttack #Merkel #WirSchaffenDas pic.twitter.com/rvl22Qgm62
Facebook has repeatedly refused to take the posts down, saying they do not violate the company's rules, Modamani's lawyer said.
""Whenever something happens in the news related to refugees, his picture reappears,"" Modamani's lawyer, Chan-jo Jun, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.
A Facebook spokesperson told Britain's Guardian newspaper they had received a takedown request from Jun ""alleging that a specific item of content on our platform violates Mr Modamani's right of personality.
""Access to that reported content was quickly disabled, so we do not believe there is any basis for him to seek an injunction,"" the spokesperson said.

One post falsely linked Modamani to an incident in Berlin last month, when a group set fire to a sleeping homeless man on a train station platform, Jun said.
The post was shared 500 times and was likely to have been seen by at least 25,000 people, he said.
Jun filed a preliminary injunction against Facebook Europe in December, and a court hearing is scheduled for February 6 in Wurzburg, southern Germany, he said.
The case comes as Germany's justice ministry considers new policies to crack down on ""fake news"" by making Facebook and other social media companies criminally liable for failing to remove hate speech.
Facebook should be treated as a media company rather than a technology company, the justice minister said in November.
Modamani now works in a fast-food restaurant in Berlin, his lawyer said.
Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's chief executive, announced a series of measures in November to stem a flood of ""fake news"" articles in the wake of the US presidential election.
He said Facebook would make it easier for users to report fake news, and more difficult for fake news providers to make money through its advertising system.

Petra Laszlo, who appeared via video link at a court in the southern city of Szeged on Thursday, mounted a tearful defence and said she would appeal.
""It was all over within two seconds,"" she said, adding she was acting out of panic and felt under attack. ""Everybody was shouting, it was very frightening.""
The incident, which occurred in September 2015, went viral after footage of her actions was uploaded to Facebook.
The court was shown a frame-by-frame examination of her actions which included delivering a roundhouse-style kick to two people, including a young girl, as they fled from police.
Later, she tripped a 52-year-old Syrian refugee carrying a child.

Judge Illes Nanasi said Laszlo's behaviour ""ran counter to societal norms"" and said the facts of the case did not support her self-defence claim.
""It is not a crime if somebody acts to defend herself ... she was in danger, and she tried to avert this danger with her actions,"" he said.
Laszlo, who had earlier said she would sue one of the refugees she tripped, was fired from her job at N1TV, a private right-wing television station in Hungary.
Political tensions in Europe have been simmering over the region's refugee crisis, although numbers have plunged by nearly two-thirds.
According to the International Organization for Migration, about 364,000 people seeking work or refugee protection crossed the Mediterranean sea in 2016, compared with more than one million in 2015.

Thomas de Maiziere said on Wednesday that about 280,000 new asylum seekers arrived in 2016, while an estimated 80,000 people either left voluntarily or were deported.
The minister said authorities hoped the number of those who leave or are deported will increase.
Arrivals declined sharply with the closure of the Balkan refugee route in March and the subsequent agreement between the European Union and Turkey to stem the flow across the Aegean Sea to Greece.
Asylum applications have lagged well behind arrivals and many people who came to Germany in 2015 applied only last year.
Wednesday's figures showed that 745,545 formal asylum applications were made last year - 268,869 more than in 2015.
Those included 268,866 applications from Syrians, 127,892 from Afghans and 97,162 from Iraqis, the biggest single groups by far.
The Federal Office for Migration and Refugees, which has been beefed up in the course of Europe's refugee crisis, decided last year on more than 695,000 asylum applications, more than twice as many as in 2015.
Nearly 60 percent of applicants were granted either full refugee status or a lesser form of protection.
The agency has also cut the average time required for an asylum decision to under three months, and introduced a nationwide database to combine identity records for all asylum seekers.
De Maiziere said that about 55,000 failed asylum seekers returned home voluntarily last year, compared with the previous year's 35,000. Another 25,000 were forcibly deported.
Chancellor Angela Merkel, who faces a national election later this year and still draws criticism for her welcoming approach to refugees and migrants in 2015, has promised a ""national effort"" to ensure that people who are not entitled to stay go home.
READ MORE: Stranded and sick, refugees endure harsh Serbian winter
The number of returns is still too low, de Maiziere said, adding that talks are under way with state authorities - who are responsible for returns - to push it up.
De Maiziere rejected the suggestion that the drop in new arrivals was the result of Europe's efforts to prevent people reaching the continent, but acknowledged that Germany was working to ensure that refugees stay in their home region.
Closed borders across Europe have left refugees and migrants trapped in difficult humanitarian conditions in the Balkans, Greece and elsewhere.
Rights groups have expressed concern about the fate of refugees and migrants as a wave of cold weather grips the region.
In Serbia, hundreds of refugees and migrants were living in abandoned buildings behind the train and bus station in the city centre.
Temperatures have dipped as low as minus 20 degrees Celsius, while access to humanitarian aid has been limited by a ban imposed by the government.

""In some cases, not only have authorities failed to provide humane conditions, they have also tried to prevent humanitarian organisations from aiding those in need,"" said Human Rights Watch in a statement last week.
In camps across mainland Greece and Greek islands, refugees and migrants have struggled as temperatures have sunk as low as minus 18 degrees in recent days.
In Moria, a camp on the island of Lesbos, more than 4,500 people who live in tents are among those hit the hardest by the snowy weather.

Two men wearing costumes of the Ku Klux Klan, the white supremacist organisation with a history of fatal racist attacks on people of colour, were ejected from the building on Tuesday after they disrupted the hearing.
Security removed them from the room as they yelled mockingly ""You can't arrest me, I am white!"" and ""White people own this government"".
Other protesters later erupted in the chant: ""No Trump! No KKK! No fascist USA!""
Civil liberties campaigners have seized on Sessions' voting record and his appearances before groups that espouse anti-Muslim and anti-immigrant views.
He was rejected for a federal judgeship by the Senate Judiciary Committee 30 years ago amid accusations of racism.
In a prepared opening statement, Sessions said that he understood ""the history of civil rights and the horrendous impact that relentless and systemic discrimination and the denial of voting rights has had on our African-American brothers and sisters"".
He also said accusations of racism were ""damnably false charges"".
In 2005, attorney general nominee Jeff Sessions refused to believe that the US was “systematically abusing prisoners” at Guantanamo Bay.
During a 1994 campaign for Alabama attorney general, Sessions came out in support of chain gangs - the forced labour of prisoners - and life sentences for children as young as 14, the progressive Mother Jones news site reports.
Sessions has also accused the National Association for the Advancement of Coloured People civil rights group and the American Civil Liberties Union of being ""un-American"", according to Gerald Hebert, a former justice department civil rights attorney who worked with Sessions in Alabama.

In the hearing, Sessions promised to stand up to Trump, his close ally and future boss, saying he would oppose a ban on Muslims entering the country and enforce a law against waterboarding even though he voted against the measure.
Speaking in New York on Monday, Trump described Sessions as a ""high-quality man"".
Sessions said he would not support banning anyone from the United States on the basis of religion and that Trump's intentions were to restrict people from countries harbouring ""terrorists"", not all Muslims. Elected on November 8, Trump at one point campaigned on a proposal to temporarily ban Muslims from entering the country.
Sessions said he favoured ""higher intensity of vetting"" for refugees seeking to enter the country but that he would oppose ending the US refugee programme.
Separately, John Kerry, the outgoing US secretary of state, said on Tuesday that there has been little contact between officials of the Department of State and Trump's transition team.
Asked about the transition process at a forum in Washington DC on Tuesday, Kerry said: ""It's going pretty smoothly because there's not an enormous amount of it.""

Mohammad Salhi, 32, was shot dead during an early-morning raid in the Faraa refugee camp in the northern occupied West Bank on Tuesday. He was not an intended target of the raid.
According to Palestinian residents of the camp, Salhi was awakened when the soldiers broke into his home. He was shot dead after he confronted them.
Palestinian medical sources said Salhi was brought to a hospital in the nearby town of Tubas hours after he was shot and after the army had left the camp.
They said he was hit by five bullets to the neck and chest and was pronounced dead on arrival.

The Israeli army said that Salhi was shot dead after he tried to stab its soldiers during the raid.
But according to the Palestinian Foreign Ministry, Salhi was ""executed in cold blood"" by soldiers in the courtyard of his home, in front of his mother.
The foreign ministry's statement identified him as a former prisoner in Israeli jails.
Yasser Abu Kishk, a resident of the camp, also rejected the Israeli version of the story.
According to Kishk, the soldiers broke into Salhi's home to reach a neighbour's home.
""Salhi was awakened by surprise and he found himself face-to-face with the soldiers,"" he told the official Voice of Palestine radio station.
""Apparently Salhi did not know what was going on, so he confronted the soldiers to protect his ailing mother and family when he was shot.""
Human rights groups have continually condemned Israeli raids in the occupied West Bank, and what they describe as a ""shoot-to-kill"" policy employed there.
The soldiers left the camp after arresting three Palestinians.

About 364,000 people seeking work or refugee protection crossed the sea between January and December, compared to more than one million in 2015, Frontex said in a statement on Friday.
A sharp drop in arrivals to Greece outweighed record migration to Italy, it said.
The decrease was largely owing to a Turkey-EU deal whereby Ankara took back migrants who crossed by sea to the Greek islands and the EU resettled Syrian refugees living in Turkey.
""The drop was also influenced by tighter border controls in the western Balkans, Frontex added.
At the same time, the number of people who died as they tried to reach Europe rose by 34 percent last year from 2015, the UN-affiliated IOM said in Geneva.
Many shipwrecks occurred on the route between Libya and the Italian island of Sicily.
The trend shows that the central Mediterranean route linking the Sahara region to Southern Europe still operates at full capacity despite European efforts to stem the flow, IOM analysts said. The deaths in the Mediterranean pushed the 2016 global death tally for migrants to 7,495. The latest reports of 300 more deaths in the Mediterranean are currently being vetted by the IOM. Last year, IOM also recorded about 1,100 fatalities in North Africa, 200 around the Horn of Africa, as well as 400 dead migrants on the route from Mexico to the United States.

Austria's defence minister has said in a new set of proposals that the European Union should curb immigration and foil people smugglers by banning refugee applications on its territory and setting up asylum application centres outside the bloc.
""This would enable EU countries to decide themselves who may enter Europe, rather than smuggling organisations,"" Hans Peter Doskozil said in a document obtained by by the DPA news agency on Friday.
The document indirectly advocates an EU-wide cap for asylum seekers, by stating that ""every country has capacity limits, beyond which integration is impossible"".
People who are not accepted as refugees should be sent home, Doskozil said. If their home countries do not take them back, they should be be transferred to ""protection zones"", he proposed, without specifying where or how they should be set up.

A coordinated EU refugee policy has so far failed to materialise as some of the bloc's members, especially in the east, have refused to take in significant numbers of refugees. In addition, EU countries have not found a way to quickly send back economic migrants.
Despite the drop in arrivals last year, an estimated 123,000 migrants still managed to travel the so-called Balkan route from Greece to western Europe, according to Frontex, despite steps by Austria and Balkan countries to stop the flow of people.
Doskozil also warned that a breakdown of the EU-Turkey deal could result in up to one million migrants launching journeys from Turkey to Europe.

The organisation's chapter in the occupied Palestinian territories recorded the killings of 32 Palestinian children (under 18), making 2016 ""the deadliest year of the past decade"" for them, the group said in a recent report.
Many of those killings happened during Israeli military raids on Palestinian towns in the occupied West Bank, confrontations with the Israeli army or during unarmed protests.
""Israeli soldiers employ a shoot-to-kill policy. They have the green light to kill Palestinians, and the fact that they can do so with impunity and no consequences builds the foundation for such shootings to take place,"" Ayed Abu Eqtaish, Accountability Programme Director at DCI-Palestine, told Al Jazeera.
Since October 2015, Israeli soldiers and settlers have been responsible for the killing of at least 244 Palestinians, including unarmed demonstrators, bystanders and alleged attackers in what has been termed the ""Jerusalem intifada"" or Jerusalem uprising.
Thirty-six Israelis have also been killed in stabbing and shooting incidents carried out by Palestinians.
""Due to the political situation, especially the Jerusalem uprising since October 2015, the numbers have gone up with tension and clashes between the Israeli army and Palestinians increasing,"" said Abu Eqtaish.
Out of the 32, 19 were between the ages of 16 and 17, while 13 were in the age group of 13 to 15 years old, according to DCI-Palestine.
In 2015, the total number of civilians under the age of 18 killed in the occupied West Bank, including East Jerusalem, stood at 28. In 2014, 13 Palestinian children were killed, while four were killed in 2013.
READ MORE: Jerusalem: 19-year-old shot protesting home demolition
""It is very rare that any investigations are opened on the killings. There has only been one incident in 2014 - that of Nadim Nuwara - in which a soldier was charged,"" said Abu Eqtaish.
On May 15, 2014, video footage showed Israeli forces firing live bullets at two unarmed Palestinian boys, Nadim Nuwara, 17 and Mahmoud Abu Thaher, 16, who were attending a protest outside Israel's Ofer prison, killing them.
The Israeli was charged with manslaughter, but his lawyers recently told Israeli media the charges may be dropped.
Fifteen-year-old Faris al-Bayed from the Jalazone refugee camp north of Ramallah in the West Bank was another victim of Israeli army aggression. Al-Bayed was killed on October 15 last year when Israeli soldiers shot a rubber-coated metal bullet at his head, which eventually resulted in his death.
Regulations for the use of rubber-coated metal bullets, also known as ""rubber bullets"", stipulate that the projectiles are meant for dispersing crowds, must be fired from at least 40 metres away at the lower body, and not at children.
Al-Bayed was attending a march near the camp to commemorate the killing of 14-year-old Ahmad Sharaka when he was shot. He remained in intensive care for 67 days in a coma before he passed away.
""You cannot imagine the pain that his mother experienced,"" al-Bayed's uncle, Abu Mohammad, told Al Jazeera.
Abu Mohammad believes the upcoming generations are now more aware than their parents and are thus being increasingly targeted by Israeli forces.
""There are killings, raids and detentions every day. It never used to be like this. With the coming of the internet and more awareness, the children are becoming more nationalistic and are aware of what is happening,"" said Abu Mohammad.
West Bank-based activist Hazem Abu Helal, says the killings are ""part of Israel's policy"".
""This is the state's racist culture that tells the Israeli army it is ok to kill Palestinians because they're getting rid of 'terrorists' whether it be a man, woman, or child,"" Abu Helal told Al Jazeera from his Ramallah home.
According to a poll conducted by the Israel Democracy Institute in August, about 47 percent of Jewish Israelis said they supported the killing of Palestinians who carry out an attack on Israelis, even if he or she had been captured and no longer posed a threat.
A group of human rights NGOs including Amnesty International found that in at least 150 of the cases since October 2015, Israeli forces ""killed Palestinians after they no longer posed a threat, killed Palestinians who did not appear to be carrying out an attack at all, or used lethal force to subdue attackers when non-lethal force would have sufficed"".
Rights organisations have repeatedly condemned such killings, which they describe as an ""excessive use of force"" whereby Israeli forces violate international human rights law.
""We know that even if we tried to get the soldier to court, nothing will happen to him. What's the point? There have been thousands of Palestinians killed over the years, and no soldier has been punished,"" said Abu Mohammad.

The US secretary of state sounded the warning on Wednesday in a final plea outlining the outgoing Obama administration's vision for peace between Israel and Palestine.
""The settler agenda is defining the future in Israel. And their stated purpose is clear: They believe in one state: Greater Israel,"" Kerry said.
""If the choice is one state, Israel can either be Jewish or democratic, it cannot be both, and it won't ever really be at peace,"" he added.
The speech in Washington, DC comes days after the US abstained from a UN vote to halt all Israeli settlement activity in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem.
By declining to use its veto at the Security Council, the US enabled the adoption of the first UN resolution since 1979 to condemn Israel over its settlements policy.
Al Jazeera's Kimberly Halkett, reporting from Washington, DC, said: ""Many question the timing of the US actions with just three weeks until the swearing in of President-elect Donald Trump. Supporters believe it is tough talk that should have come years earlier. Critics argue it shouldn't have come at all.""
Trump, who had called on the US to veto the UN vote, told reporters that Israel is being treated ""very, very unfairly"", maintaining that countries that are ""horrible places"" never get reprimanded at the Security Council.
He refused to directly answer a question about whether Israel should stop building settlements, saying he is ""very, very strong on Israel"".
OPINION: UN settlement resolution is too little and too late
Settlements built on Palestinian land are considered illegal under international law.
There are close to 600,000 Israeli citizens living in Jewish-only housing settlements across the West Bank, and at least 200,000 in East Jerusalem, according to the Israeli human rights watchdog B'tselem.
Kerry defended the US decision to abstain from the UN vote, saying they voted ""in accordance with our [US] values"" and conscience.
""No one thinking seriously about peace can ignore the reality of the threat settlements pose to peace,"" Kerry said. ""The problem goes well beyond just settlements. Trends indicate a comprehensive effort to take West Bank land for Israel and prevent any Palestinian development there.""
Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said he was ready to resume peace talks if Israel agreed to freeze settlement construction.
Palestinian chief negotiator Saeb Erekat said: ""Abbas is fully convinced that just, comprehensive and lasting peace can be achieved, and it's doable in all core issues on the basis on the Arab Peace Initiative.""
Specific terms of the Saudi-brokered initiative include ending the Israeli occupation, establishing a Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital on the 1967 borders, and solving issues such as ""refugees and prisoners on the basis of the relevant international legality resolutions"", said Erekat.
In his response to the speech, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Kerry's words were a ""great disappointment"".
""If the US is true to its word, it should now come out and say we will not allow any more resolutions in the Security Council on Israel, period,"" he added.
The conflict was not about settlements but about ""Israel's very right to exist"", he said.
INTERACTIVE: Palestine Remix
In his speech, Kerry insisted that Israel and a future Palestinian state should exist on the territory they held before the 1967 war, which could be achieved through ""equivalent swaps"" of land only by mutual consent.
Kerry said a fair and realistic solution must be found for the Palestinian refugee issue ""with international assistance that includes compensation and options in assistance in finding permanent homes and acknowledgment of suffering"".
There are approximately five million registered Palestinian refugees, many living in camps across the occupied Palestinian territories as well as the neighbouring Arab countries, according to the UN refugee agency.
INTERACTIVE: The journey from Nazareth to Bethlehem, today
""Today, there are a similar number of Jews and Palestinians living between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea,"" said Kerry.
""They have a choice. They can choose to live together in one state, or they can separate into two states.""
Al Jazeera's Andrew Simmons, reporting from Jerusalem, said Kerry's speech was more of a ""massive defence of the US administration's actions in not vetoing the UN resolution"" than a ""blueprint for the future"".
Kerry has made it ""clear to all where he and Obama stand on the dangers of the two-state solution falling apart"", he said.

He said the truce would begin at midnight on Thursday (22:00 GMT) and be followed by peace talks between Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's government and the Syrian opposition in the Kazakh capital Astana.
""The agreements reached are, no doubt, very fragile and they demand special attention and follow-up in order to keep them and develop them. Nevertheless, this is a notable result of our joint work, efforts by the defence and foreign ministries, our partners in the regions,"" Putin said.
READ MORE: Fate of Syrian ceasefire plan remains unclear
""Now we need to do everything for these agreements to work, so that negotiators would come to Astana and would begin to work on real peace process. I call on the Syrian government, armed opposition, all countries involved to support these agreements.""
Putin's announcement followed a statement carried by Syrian state news agency SANA, which said the agreement excluded the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) group, Jabhat Fateh al-Sham, the group formerly known as al-Nusra Front, and ""groups linked to them"", without specifying who these groups are.
Al Jazeera's Hashem Ahelbarra, reporting from Gaziantep on the Turkish border with Syria, said excluding Jabhat Fateh al-Sham could ""create some problems"" and ""futher undermine the ceasefire's chances of holding"".
The group, he said, ""has presence in areas where moderate rebel groups are operating - around Aleppo, Idlib and on the outskirts of Damascus"".
""If the Russians and the Syrian government decide to target the positions of Nusra [Jabhat Fateh al-Sham], the potential for casualties among other groups is going to be high"".
Sergei Shoigu, Russia's defence minister, said the truce would include 62,000 opposition fighters across Syria.
The Turkish foreign ministry confirmed the agreement and called on countries with influence on groups fighting in the country to provide the necessary support for the ceasefire to last.
""Russia and Turkey strongly support the truce and will monitor it together,"" the ministry said.
Reporting from Moscow, Al Jazeera's Natasha Ghoneim said three different documents had been signed as part of a trilateral agreement involving Russia, Turkey and Iran.
""The first document lays out an agreement between the Syrian government and opposition groups on the ground. The second document includes measures designed to control the ceasefire and the third lays out what needs to happen next in order for there to be peace talks.""
Details of the agreement remained hazy, our correspondent said, and it was unclear which opposition groups had been involved in the negotiating process.
""Just a day ago the negotiating arm of the largest group of rebels fighting under the banner of the Free Syrian Army said they had yet to be in contact with anyone and had not been invited to participate in talks.""
In his announcement, Putin said the Russian military had been ordered to scale down its presence in Syria, where it has been providing crucial support to Assad's forces.
He did not say how many troops and weapons would be withdrawn, but said Russia would continue ""fighting international terrorism in Syria"" and would maintain its presence at both an airbase in the coastal province of Latakia and the naval facility in the port of Tartus.
The Syrian conflict started as a largely unarmed uprising against Assad in March 2011, but quickly developed into a full-on armed civil war.
Staffan de Mistura, the UN special envoy to Syria, estimated in April that more than 400,000 Syrians had been killed since 2011.
Calculating a precise death toll is difficult, partially owing to the forced disappearances of tens of thousands of Syrians whose fates remain unknown.
Almost 11 million Syrians - half the country's prewar population - have been displaced from their homes.

Separately, German security officials told Reuters news agency the number of those deported after their asylum requests were rejected rose to almost 23,800 from January to November - up from almost 20,900 in all of 2015.
There has also been a rise in the number of refugees turned away at the borders.
A report by the Neue Osnabruecker Zeitung daily said police had turned back 19,720 refugees through the first 11 months of 2016 - up from 8,913 in all of 2015.
Most were from Afghanistan, Syria, Iraq and Nigeria. They had been registered in other EU countries.
Inside Story - Why is Germany being targeted?
As public support for her pro-refugee policies wanes ahead of September's federal election, Merkel has said it is vital to focus resources on those fleeing war, and to keep up public support by deporting foreigners to countries where there is no persecution.
Attacks and security alerts involving refugees and migrants have boosted the popularity of the anti-immigration Alternative for Germany party, whose rise above 10 percent in opinion polls could complicate Merkel's re-election hopes.
On Tuesday, seven refugees from Syria and Iraq aged 15 to 21 were detained in Berlin on charges of attempted murder for trying to set fire to a homeless man in an underground station.

Bethlehem, occupied West Bank - Abuses of power committed by Israel's Civilian Security Coordinators (CSCs), civilian guards of the illegal settlements, continue to contribute to settlement expansion into Palestinian-owned land across the occupied West Bank, according to an Israeli rights group.
In following the behaviour of the CSC guards over a decade, rights group Yesh Din has come across reports of guards doling out death threats and chasing Palestinian farmers from their fields at gunpoint to prevent them from harvesting, among other violations.
""When these [violations] are done systematically over the years, Palestinian farmers understand that it's not useful to come to their own land located near what used to be settlement outskirts,"" said Eyal Hareuveni, a researcher at Yesh Din. ""And when done repeatedly again and again for a few years, the Palestinian gives up.""
The ""unused"" space is then allocated for settlement expansion, according to Yesh Din lawyer Michal Pasovsky.
""The minute these borders of the CSC [guarding zone] extend beyond municipality borders and Palestinians are afraid to go to their land, that gives the settlers an opportunity to build there,"" Pasovsky said.
When these [violations] are done systematically over the years, Palestinian farmers understand that it's not useful to come to their own land located near what used to be settlement outskirts.
Eyal Hareuveni, Yesh Din researcher
Under Israeli military law, CSCs are settlers armed and trained by the military to protect their settlements on behalf of the army. While CSCs are given policing powers and work in coordination with army forces, they are appointed by fellow settlers and directly employed by settlements.
However, according to Yesh Din's chronology and analysis, the Israeli military's declared goal of employing CSCs to protect Israeli civilians conceals a more important function the CSCs serve: expanding Israel's borders.
""Not only do they [CSCs] harass these Palestinian farmers, but they also seek to expand the areas under their control and annex as much of that land as possible,"" Pasovsky told Al Jazeera.
According to Yesh Din, the concept of a CSC was initially conceived by Zionist forces during the British Mandate, through a doctrine of ""regional defence"" that relied on civilians in frontline communities to fight in support of armed forces in demarcating the borders of the future state.
The regional defence approach was formalised by Israeli law in 1961 and later applied in illegal settlements in the West Bank - four years after Israel illegally occupied the area - through a military order stipulating that CSCs take position in the 12 settlements that had been constructed by 1971.
The 1971 order loosely defined CSC powers for protecting settlements and remains in effect today. A number of military orders have been issued since, specifying their exact policing powers and guarding zones.
The doctrine was used again during the late 1970s in Supreme Court rulings that enabled theft of Palestinian land for settlements, as well as in military orders defining the role that CSCs would play in their protection, according to the Yesh Din report
The Israeli authorities have continued to reference the doctrine ever since to justify the use of CSCs in illegal settlements, which now number more than 220 and are home to well over a half-million settlers.
The Ministry of Defence, which gives money to settlements to pay CSC salaries, was not able to provide the current number of CSCs, nor was the Israeli army.
Yesh Din, for its part, argues that a major conflict of interest arises when law enforcement powers are granted to individuals who hold special interests - in this case those who represent interests of the settlement enterprise.
""The granting of such sweeping powers to an interest group that openly and declaratively rejects the provisions of international law is indicative of the chaos that characterises the official Israeli attitude toward law enforcement in the West Bank,"" Hareuveni wrote in the Yesh Din report.
Simon Reynolds, a former legal advocate for the BADIL Resource Center for Palestinian Residency and Refugee Rights, said that giving law enforcement powers to special interest groups by the Israeli military is part and parcel of the ongoing settlement expansion which is, and always has been, an Israeli national interest.
""Settlement expansion represents a strategic interest which has been consistently and publicly stated by the highest echelons of Israeli government, while the impunity enjoyed by CSCs and other settlers contributes to the continued erosion of Palestinian 'safe space',"" Reynolds told Al Jazeera.
Yesh Din's documentation of violations carried out by CSCs - while fairly low in number - align with long-lived trends of settler violence leading to illegal expropriation of Palestinian land, in addition to near-daily demolition of Palestinian homes and structures, forced transfer, and implementation of military training zones on - or near - Palestinian land.
New outposts often created through such tactics are retroactively legalised, with nearly one third of outposts to be illegally established in the past two decades later okayed by the Israeli government.
The Israeli Knesset most recently passed a first reading of a bill that would retroactively legalise some 55 illegal outposts in the occupied West Bank, in what Peace Now said would constitute ""grand land robbery"" and ""another step towards annexation"".
OPINION: Israel's culpability in settler violence
Yesh Din reported that Israeli military orders issued in 2009 defined the exact parameters of CSCs' guarding zones and designated - for the first time - the territorial borderlines of 35 unauthorised outposts, some of which were later legalised by the government. The 2009 orders also drew guarding zones around 40 outposts located outside settlement municipal boundaries.
Reynolds said CSC offences, as documented by Yesh Din, ""enjoy the tacit acceptance of the government by way of a culture of impunity"". This impunity is demonstrated by Yesh Din's failed efforts to hold CSCs accountable for abuses of power.
The rights group's spokesperson, Gilad Grossman, said that out of 16 cases of CSC violation in 2014 that the group brought to the police or military, none led to indictments. In five other cases, Palestinians chose not to file complaints either out of fear of negative repercussions from the Israeli authorities or the CSC, or lack of confidence in the Israeli justice system.
Pasovsky told Al Jazeera that the while CSCs work on behalf of the army inside of guarding zones, the military considers the guard a civilian as soon as they exit these zones, subject instead to investigation by Israeli police and border police, who systematically ignore infractions against Palestinians.
If the military does choose to investigate a CSC for offences, the ""administrative investigation"" allowed by military law is ""problematic"", Pasovsky said, fundamentally flawed in its ability to effectively investigate CSC violations because Palestinian complainants are excluded from the investigation process.
""If we [Yesh Din] come forth with our information, they're [the army] able to investigate it only with the security coordinator,"" Pasovsky said. Hareuveni told Al Jazeera that whenever Yesh Din has attempted to file complaints against CSC offences, the army ""always pushes away from"" holding the guard accountable, adding that there is no documentation showing that a CSC has ever been tried in a disciplinary manner by the army.
In response, the Israeli army said claims that the army turns a blind eye to CSC violations of the law were ""unfounded"".
""Whenever knowledge of a possible overstep of boundaries by a security coordinator reaches authorities, an inquiry is mounted, and when relevant, sanctions are levied, as part of the coordinator's employment contract,"" an Israeli army spokesperson told Al Jazeera in a written statement.
READ MORE: Palestinians - Israel settlement expansion a 'war crime'
The army added that the military commander - the direct supervisor of a CSC - ""takes further proactive measures in order to ensure security coordinators act within the limits of their authority and in accordance to the law"".
Hareuveni rejected military claims of oversight of CSCs, citing the army's role in facilitating nearly five decades of settlement expansion in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem.
""The army is part of this political system,"" Hareuveni told Al Jazeera. ""It doesn't play any kind of independent professional role, as many Israelis want to see. It supports the settlements, it supports the illegal outposts ... it doesn't do anything meaningful about settlers' violence or anything about settlers taking by force Palestinian private land,"" Hareuveni said.
While Yesh Din acknowledges that impunity towards CSC violations is systematic, Pasovsky hopes that documenting their violations through complaint processes to the military will place pressure on CSCs to stop transgressions.
""They [CSCs] need to understand that there's someone watching, they cannot do whatever they want ... if they are being called into a military office to discuss their actions, this for us is very important,"" Pasovsky said.

In November 2014, 11 bit studios released This War of Mine, a computer game set in a city under siege. Players must ensure the survival of civilians trapped in an abandoned house, battling hunger, illness and exhaustion, and risking their lives to scavenge for supplies.
The studio approached War Child and offered to use the game to help with raising funds and awareness. The game - since re-released for mobile devices, PlayStation and Xbox - was released in a special edition on Steam, from which all profits were donated to War Child. It raised a significant sum of money for the charity, while also generating awareness of the organisation's work by confronting players with the dangers facing civilians in countries such as Syria. Gaming is now so ubiquitous that it allows for a truly global reach, Little said.
""I think it's a fantastic industry to be working with in terms of fundraising, but also raising awareness … It's not like a transition from one media to another, where people read the same thing online or on tablets. It's completely new audiences,"" she told Al Jazeera.
Nadim Shartouny, a specialist in interactive technologies and a managing partner at The Council, a Beirut-based post-production studio, noted that gaming is a particularly effective outreach tool because it fits in with existing behaviour patterns.
""Most people, especially the younger generation, play a lot of games, so you're not taking them away from something they like to do and telling them to do something else to help with a cause,"" Shartouny told Al Jazeera. ""They stay doing what they're doing, and they can still help … Before you needed to call, say, 1-800-donate or send an SMS. Right now you can have a QR code where you just scan and donate. You can click a button on your phone and donate. You can snap a photo and donate … It's quick and easy.""
By engaging users on a personal level, interactive media aims to elicit a sense of empathy and social responsibility. Several charities have designed online quizzes that encourage players to engage with the topic in a fun way and build up an emotional investment, before asking for donations.
""Innovation is becoming increasingly important overall in humanitarian programmes, particularly when you're in a situation where you've been in a crisis for several years,"" said Matthew Saltmarsh, a senior communications officer with the UN's refugee agency, UNHCR, in Lebanon.
Gaming is not the only form of interactive media being harnessed by aid organisations: At the World Economic Forum in Davos last January, the UN Millennium Campaign debuted the UN's first foray into virtual reality. Clouds Over Sidra was shot in the Zaatari refugee camp with the help of UNICEF Jordan, and is narrated by a 12-year-old girl who describes life in the camp. The film provides a 360-degree view of every scene, allowing viewers to look around in any direction.
""You actually think you are inside the camp,"" UNICEF Jordan spokeswoman Miraj Pradhan told Al Jazeera. ""The way it's filmed, you can turn around and see kids playing or going to school … It gives you a much more personal experience than watching it on a flat screen.""
UNICEF Jordan has placed an increasing emphasis on interactive technologies in recent years. In addition to the film and the portal project, they have on several occasions invited Syrian refugee children to take over their official Twitter account, tweeting about their day-to-day lives and answering questions from people around the world.
""It's really helpful if children themselves talk about how they go to school, what are the challenges and what they like about the camp,"" Pradhan said. ""I think that is quite powerful.""

The emphasis on interactivity is likely to continue as new technologies emerge, Shartouny said - but a successful campaign is more complicated than simply latching on to the latest gimmick.
""You can create a game, [but] nobody will play it if you don't market it properly and you don't keep it running properly,"" he said. ""People get bored quickly. We don't use 90 percent of the apps on our phones. How can you make the user always use your app? That needs so much work. It needs 10 times the budget it took to actually develop the game.""
In addition, the swift pace of technological advancement means that projects quickly become obsolete. My Life As a Refugee, a mobile phone game produced by UNHCR and released in 2012, is still available as a free download, but it now appears old-fashioned.
Ariane Rummary, a senior communications officer at UNHCR's headquarters in Geneva, said that while the immersive element of interactive technology is useful for engaging the public, the underlying approach to most humanitarian campaigns remains the same.
""This idea of putting yourself in the refugee's shoes is not new,"" Rummary told Al Jazeera. ""We've been doing that for a really long time. But I think what technology is doing is giving us more fun ways to do that.""

In these corners, refugees from Syria, Palestine, Afghanistan and Iraq are creating their own community centres in Athens. Now that they have food, clothing and education, they are striving for fuller lives and self-empowerment.
Jafra is the first relief organisation in Greece formed exclusively by refugees. Among its initiatives is a series of dance lessons for refugee children to connect with their culture.
""Almost all the world believes that refugees are weak,"" Housam Jackl, Jafra spokesperson, told Al Jazeera.
""They came from war, by smugglers to the sea. We believe that the refugees have a lot of experience. They can organise [community activities] by themselves. We wanted to change the image of refugees.""
Most Jafra members are women, who have organised a knitting room. They sold clothes for a small income.
Other members work in building or plumbing.
The refugee-run squats and Jafra provide an added bonus: diversity. Refugees of all backgrounds make a point of working together, putting aside differences as a first step towards their European integration.

But questions remain over several aspects of the new plan for Rukban camp, with rights organisations saying that it continues to fall short of international humanitarian standards.
""Despite the immense challenges posed by the harsh and remote environment, distribution of humanitarian assistance, including a monthly food ration and winter supplies, has been made to 8,404 households, meeting the needs of an estimated 31,094 people in Rukban and Hadalat,"" David McLachlan-Karr, the UN's interim humanitarian coordinator for Jordan, told Al Jazeera. Hadalat is a smaller settlement north of the main one at Rukban.
""The conditions at the berm are dire, worsened further by the advent of the harsh winter weather,"" he added. ""The UN's partners are working as hard as possible to expedite the distribution of assistance to all of those in need.""
READ MORE: Syrian refugees stuck on Jordan border 'have nothing'
The conditions at Rukban, a remote and arid part of the desert in northeastern Jordan, have been troubling for a while, with no toilets, running water or electricity since the informal camp sprang up more than a year ago. Nearly 95 percent of households do not have enough food, according to a needs assessment conducted by World Vision International, and some people are reported to have sold their tents just to buy something to eat.
Dwellings are makeshift and unable to withstand the increasingly harsh, cold weather conditions. Medical care has been almost non-existent, and only five to six litres of water for each person is available every day - about a third of the international standard. Around three-quarters of the residents are women and children.
Things deteriorated significantly after the Jordanian army sealed off the entire Syrian border, following a deadly car bombing carried out by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL, also known as ISIS) at Rukban in June, with just one major aid delivery all summer: a month's worth of food, hygiene kits and shelter materials dropped over the berm by crane in early August.
One of the primary reasons people are clustered along the Jordanian border is because they feel safe there, both from Russian bombing and from ISIS. So encouraging them to move is a problem.
Adam Coogle, Human Rights Watch researcher
In a sign of the high level of security in the area, even the trickle of donations from smaller local organisations have been subject to heavy restrictions. Helping Refugees in Jordan, a group of local volunteers, sent 1,400 packages of food essentials to Rukban before large-scale aid resumed, but they were delayed for weeks while the Jordanian army checked every single box.
UN aid is now being funnelled through a new distribution point around six kilometres west of the current one, which is situated near a Jordanian military base, and further back towards Syria. As UN staff cannot cross the Jordanian border to distribute aid, that will be done by contractors. Water will be delivered via a specially built pipeline, although that is not expected to be finished until the end of the year. The aim appears to be to encourage the refugees to move from their current location in order to give the Jordanian army more breathing room in the event of another attack.
""It's good that there's a resumption of aid, as the refugees there are in desperate shape,"" Human Rights Watch (HRW) researcher Adam Coogle told Al Jazeera.
However, he added that from HRW's perspective, the new distribution point was very clearly inside Syria, and that incentivising refugees to relocate there was troubling.
""We would consider it refoulement,"" he said, referring to the legal term for forcing refugees to return to a country where they might be persecuted - the prohibition of which is a cornerstone of international refugee law. ""One of the primary reasons people are clustered along the Jordanian border is because they feel safe there, both from Russian bombing and from ISIS. So encouraging them to move is a problem.""
Amnesty International has also criticised the plan, calling it little more than a band-aid.
""While the UN plan for aid distribution will bring short-term relief for the population, it is not a long-term solution,"" Khairunissa Dhala, a refugee researcher at Amnesty, told Al Jazeera. ""The security threats that Jordan fears are the same ones feared by thousands of refugees stranded at the berm. They are also struggling to survive and in desperate need of food aid and life-saving medical treatment. The Jordanian authorities, with the help of the international community, must grant sanctuary to refugees fleeing the bloodshed in Syria.""
This seems unlikely, however. Early last month, government spokesman and information minister Mohamed Momani reiterated that Jordan would not compromise its security by reopening the border at Rukban, describing part of the camp as an ISIL ""enclave"".
There are also ongoing concerns about how to provide much-needed mass medical care for the large population at the berm, particularly as winter descends. A new service facility on the Jordanian side of the border will include a clinic providing primary, maternity and newborn healthcare, but patients must be screened by the Jordanian security forces before they can cross the border to access it.
READ MORE: Syrian refugees suffering on Jordan's border
It remains unclear when, or if, international aid workers will be allowed across the berm. Some aid organisations are understood to be planning to provide medicine through contractors or proxies, but Doctors without Borders, known by its French initials MSF, says this is hugely problematic due to the risk of partisanship.
""What we support is direct access of qualified medical staff from any humanitarian organisation ... that can provide quality and independent services to the population,"" Luiz Eguilez, the head of the mission for MSF - Netherlands in Jordan, told Al Jazeera. ""You cannot deliver healthcare with cranes or contractors. So we are negotiating with the army to have direct access inside.""
MSF's work in Rukban prior to the border closure gives a sense of how widespread the health issues are in the camp, particularly with easily preventable diseases. In the month before the June 21 bombing, Eguilez's team saw 3,500 patients; a third had diarrhoea, and there were many cases of skin diseases and respiratory infections due to the lack of sanitation and dryness in the area. Nearly a quarter of households at Rukban include one or more pregnant women, according to World Vision.
""Based on what we saw ... plus four months of no healthcare, we can say the health situation there is quite bad now,"" said Eguilez.
""Through unverified sources [in recent months] we have also seen cases of jaundice ... and a certain number of malnutrition cases,"" he added. ""With only one delivery of food, this is bound to have got worse.""

Deaths linked to Mediterranean crossings by refugees have spiked in 2016, as arrivals to Europe fell.
Last year, over a million people crossed the sea - mostly from Turkey to Greece - with 3,771 deaths recorded. But this year, about 360,000 people have successfully crossed, most between Libya and Italy, with far more deadly results.
On average, 14 people have died every single day this year in the Mediterranean
William Spindler, UNHCR
""The latest information we have is that yesterday, in two incidents, as many as 100 people lost their lives,"" said William Spindler, spokesman for the UN refugee agency, UNHCR.
""The number of people who have lost their lives on the Mediterranean this year has now passed 5,000,"" he added. ""That means that on average, 14 people have died every single day this year in the Mediterranean trying to find safety or a better life or safety in Europe.""
Citing survivors' accounts, Joel Millman, of the International Organization for Migration, said that at least 57 people were feared dead following the capsizing on Thursday of a rubber dinghy carrying between 120 and 140 people.
He said eight bodies had been recovered in that area. Another 40 people were feared dead from another dinghy carrying about 120 people.
Millman said he did not immediately have further details about the possible causes of the shipwrecks.

UNHCR said the Italian coastguard carried out a total of four rescue operations in the central Mediterranean on Thursday, including the rescue of about 175 people from another dinghy and a wooden boat.
The coastguard helped the rescued survivors to disembark at the western Sicilian town of Trapani.
Among possible causes for the increase in deaths on the Mediterranean this year, the refugee agency cited a worsening quality of vessels used, as well as the tactics adopted by smugglers to prevent detection by authorities - such as sending many boats out at the same time, which makes the work of rescuers harder.

A friend, also from Chad, sits silently next to him.
""Everyone is tired here,"" Ali, 27, tells Al Jazeera in a low voice. ""We have nothing to talk about any more. We are just waiting.""
These men have been living in Choucha camp, in a windswept piece of desert in southern Tunisia, since its foundation by the United Nations refugee agency (UNHCR) in early 2011. Ali has been on the run for years: He fled his village in Chad's border region near Darfur, Sudan, in 2005 after it came under attack from armed gangs. He lived in Libya for years, earning money by cleaning government buildings, but was forced to flee again as violence broke out during Libya's 2011 uprising - and from there, he crossed the border into Choucha camp.
But in June 2013, after relocating several thousand refugees from Choucha to western countries, UNHCR determined that its mission was complete and closed the camp, removing the toilets, showers, electricity and running water.
READ MORE: Refugees left behind in Tunisia's desert
Around 700 people - whose refugee claims were denied but who believed their lives would be in danger if they returned home - remained in the camp, a number that his since dwindled to about 60.
""During Ramadan, I lost my mind,"" Ali says, with a bag containing medicines to treat depression, anxiety and schizophrenia laid out in front of him. ""They say I walked away into the desert and burned myself, but I can't remember ... Since I fell ill, I've just begged for food from the Libyans passing by on the road. Anyway, these days there is little work.""
Snakes and cockroaches swarm under our beds. It is inhumane here.
Ali Ali, camp resident
The Chadians with whom he shares his tent have gone to the nearest city of Ben Gardane, 20km away, to obtain casual labour whenever they can, constructing houses or loading lorries. Payment is around $10 a day.
The oldest and only Egyptian man in the camp, 68-year-old Ali Ali, sits a little further away in a small garden around the tent, made from a few desert plants, stones and plastic bottles. He says he was tortured in Libya before coming here, accused of ""bringing the revolution from Egypt"". He says he has tried to commit suicide twice.
""Snakes and cockroaches swarm under our beds. It is inhumane here,"" he tells Al Jazeera.
Chamseddine Marzoug, a fisherman and volunteer for the Red Crescent from the nearby city of Zarzis, goes to the camp each month on his own initiative to bring medicines and to drive sick people to the hospital. He acknowledges that the refugees' mental health is declining.
""Many men in Choucha are traumatised and depressed,"" Marzoug says.
Oliver Tringham, a British refugee advocate affiliated with AMERA International who has been helping refugees in the camp since it opened, says it is clear that they need help.
""I think the vast majority of the Chouchans have been suffering from PTSD [post-traumatic stress disorder], which has manifested in their physical wellbeing,"" Tringham tells Al Jazeera.
Parker, a 36-year-old refugee who declined to give his last name, and Mamadou Sylla, 28 - both from the Ivory Coast - sit in front of one of the most well-built tents, which they jokingly call the ""White House"". Parker worked for a year as a welder in Tunis, but recently decided to return to Choucha, because he never received more than half of his promised salary of $272 a month.
After the closure of Choucha, the Tunisian government announced that the people who remained in the camp could get residency permits.
""A few hundred wanted to stay here and applied for residency, but never received it,"" Tringham says.
Moez Ben Dhia, a former adviser to Tunisia's minister of social affairs, tells Al Jazeera that many of the refugees did not meet the legal requirements - such as holding the necessary identification papers - for obtaining residency permits. Plans were made to amend that law, he said, but that never happened owing to the political tumult in Tunisia.
In addition, Ben Dhia said, many of those who remained in the camp rejected staying in Tunisia, instead expressing a desire to travel to Western countries. Others declined to give fingerprints out of fear that they could be sent back home, he said.
[Those still in Choucha] have to face reality. They can go back home if they wish, or apply for a residency permit like any other foreigner.
Felicitas Nebril, UNHCR's deputy representative in Tunis
""The camp does not exist for us any more,"" Hilmi Tlili, a current official with the Ministry of Social Affairs, tells Al Jazeera inside his Tunis office. ""It has been closed for more than three years. It is not our responsibility any more.""
Parker and Sylla say they do not understand why they were not given asylum by UNHCR, expressing hope that the agency will reopen their case files. Sylla says that rebel fighters in the Ivory Coast killed his mother, who was against them, but ""UNHCR did not believe my story. The interview went fast. I did not have the chance to explain my situation well.""
Tringham maintains that there were clear deficiencies, including translation problems, in the refugee determination procedure at Choucha, a position rejected by the agency.
""Mistakes are not likely to happen,"" Felicitas Nebril, UNHCR's deputy representative in Tunis, tells Al Jazeera. ""The asylum application is a process, not just one interview and one interviewer. There are other interviewing officers and translators, as well as appeals procedures that have taken place ... [Those still in Choucha] have to face reality. They can go back home if they wish, or apply for a residency permit like any other foreigner.""
The Tunis-based Forum Tunisien pour les Droits Economiques et Sociaux, an NGO that was against the closure of the camp, has asked UNHCR to reopen the remaining cases.
""The fact that they are still in that terrible place proves it is dangerous for them to return to their countries,"" Romdhan Ben Amor, a spokesperson for the forum, tells Al Jazeera. ""Nobody cares about them. The camp has caused the government and the international organisations a real headache.""
Doctor Mongi Slim of the Red Crescent in Zarzis, however, says that the refugees at Choucha can ""go to our shelters in Zarzis or Medenine and receive food and medical care, but they prefer to stay in the camp to show the media they are victims"". He adds that the government should clear out the camp and move the residents elsewhere for humanitarian and security reasons.
Back in the camp, many of the tents have been abandoned or collapsed into heaps amid the ruthless winds.
""Most people went to Italy in small boats,"" Ali Ahmed Ali says, noting that he sometimes receives messages from friends in France or Sweden. Others have simply disappeared: ""Perhaps they drowned, or died in the desert in Algeria.""
Benedict Joseph, a 33-year-old refugee from Liberia, passes by Ali's tent on his way to the highway, hoping that a Libyan man, who often drops off baguettes in the afternoon, will come today as well. He usually eats only once a day.
""We still have hope that we can go to a Western country,"" he says, smiling. ""How else can we stay alive? Here, you learn to be patient.""

The man released was a young Pakistani refugee who had arrived in Germany in February.
""The investigation up to now did not yield any urgent suspicion against the accused,"" the prosecutor's office said in a statement on Tuesday.
It said the suspect had made extensive statements during a police hearing, but had denied the offence.
Under German law, prosecutors have until the end of the calendar day following an arrest to seek a formal arrest warrant keeping a suspect in custody.
The prosecutor's office also said that it had been impossible to track the truck driver by witnesses after Monday's attack and that, so far, police had not been able to prove that the suspect was in the truck at the time of the attack.
It was not clear who the perpetrator was.
Thomas Maiziere, Germany's interior minister, said: ""One cannot rule out that the perpetrator is still at large.""
He said police had not just followed a single lead but multiple leads from the start.
It remained beyond doubt that the truck incident was an attack, Maizier said, but the motives remain unclear.
German officials, including Chancellor Angela Merkel, have called the incident a ""terrorist"" attack.
The truck struck the popular Christmas market outside the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church late on Monday as tourists and locals enjoyed a traditional pre-Christmas evening near Berlin's Zoo station.
Dozens of people were wounded. Jan Hollitzer, a witness, told Al Jazeera the truck drove about 50 metres through the market.
Recalling the scene, Hollitzer said the vehicle was travelling ""very fast"".
""It was really horrible. There were many casualties and injured people,"" he said.
""I saw people hit by the truck and also people under the truck ... I can tell you those are images you don't want to see.""
Among the dead was a man in the lorry, who died as paramedics treated him, Winfried Wenzel, Berlin police spokesman, said.
Police identified him as a Polish national, but did not give further details. The truck had a Polish licence plate, police said. The Polish owner of the truck said he feared the vehicle may have been hijacked.
Al Jazeera's Sonia Gallego, reporting from Berlin, said the atmosphere in the German capital was ""mournful"".
""The security officials are left with a worrying situation"" following the release of the suspect, our correspondent said. ""They are having to follow on ... You have an armed and dangerous person on the loose, an extreme concern for police.""
She added that there were currently more tourists in the capital because of the Christmas holidays.

The UK-based Action Group for Palestinians in Syria warned that Yarmouk's ""humanitarian situation is going from bad to worse"" in a statement published on Tuesday.
Yarmouk was once home to nearly 200,000 Palestinian refugees and Syrians, and most of its former residents have been displaced to other parts of Syria or outside the country.
Stuck between a brutal blockade and armed clashes, a mere 6,250 civilians are believed to be in Yarmouk, according to UNRWA, the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees.
""Health facilities are limited and the humanitarian situation can change rapidly given levels of vulnerability,"" spokesman Chris Gunness told Al Jazeera.
Gunness added that UNRWA has been unable to access the refugees from the camp since its last aid convoy went in May 2016.
Syrian government forces and militias loyal to President Bashar al-Assad have imposed a blockade on the camp since December 2012, restricting the flow of food, medicine and other humanitarian goods to civilians.
The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL, also known as ISIS) invaded Yarmouk in March 2015.
ISIL controls of most of the camp's territory, while a handful of neighbourhoods are still held by Jabhat Fateh al-Sham (formerly al-Nusra Front) and other fighters.
READ MORE: ISIL and Nusra put Yarmouk civilians in line of fire
Wesam Sabaaneh, director of the Jafra Foundation, a humanitarian group that works in Syria's Palestinian camps, said Yarmouk is often rocked by ""sporadic clashes"" between government forces and armed groups, as well as clashes between ISIL and Jabhat Fateh al-Sham.
""The situation for civilians is very bad,"" Sabaaneh told Al Jazeera, describing life in the camp as ""a siege within a siege"" for the remaining residents.
""ISIL is imposing strict laws, such as requiring niqab [a full face veil], as well as taking over the schools. It has also carried out executions of civilians in the streets,"" he added.
""There are water shortages and no electricity, and it's getting worse now that winter is setting in. There's no clean water or medicine, so there's a lot of fear that illnesses will spread very fast in the camp,"" Sabaaneh said, explaining that medical care is available only in a few makeshift clinics.
On Friday, the Action Group reported that Hussein al-Misri, a 70-year-old refugee, died ""due to the lack of medical care and the acute shortage [of] life-saving medicines"" in Yarmouk.
Misri is among more than 3,411 Palestinian refugees - at least 1,277 from Yarmouk - who have died as a result of Syria's more than five-year civil war.
Among the deaths documented by the Action Group were 188 people who died as a direct result of the blockade. Another 477 were killed by shelling and 160 died during torture. Others were killed by gunfire, car bombs, field executions and along the treacherous refugee trail to Europe.
At least 1,135 Palestinians remain behind bars in the government's prisons, while 300 are missing, the group estimates.
Q&A: Beyond Yarmouk, Palestinians in Syria need aid
Although Syria's conflict started as largely unarmed protests against Assad's rule in March 2011, it quickly turned into a full-scale civil war that has killed hundreds of thousands. More than half the country's pre-war population has been displaced.
Salim Salamah, director of the Palestinian League for Human Rights - Syria, explained that Palestinian refugees are particularly vulnerable because they are already stateless.
""To be brutally honest, this is just a reflection of the larger Syrian trajectory,"" he told Al Jazeera.
""For Palestinians, what is more worrisome is what is after this forced displacement. The reality of statelessness has re-emerged.""

Fabrice Leggeri, executive director of the Frontex border agency, was quoted on Saturday as saying about 180,000 people arrived via Turkey and the eastern Mediterranean, while 170,000 reached the continent across the central Mediterranean route from Libya and Egypt.
Leggeri told German daily Ruhr-Nachrichten a deal between the EU and Turkey reduced the number of refugees and migrants coming from the east, but migration from northern Africa rose 30 percent.
Earlier, the International Organization of Migration (IOM) said that 4,812 people have died on the Mediterranean so far this year - a record number.
That is about 1,200 more than last year between January to the end of November.
According to the IOM, 7,189 migrants and asylum seekers have died so far this year around the world, notably in Central America.
That is an average of 20 deaths each day, with the IOM predicting that another 200 to 300 will die en route to safer lands before the year is over.
IOM spokesman Leonard Doyle told Al Jazeera that the casualty numbers are ""undoubtedly an underestimate"".
""This is the numbers we have of people who are reported to have died, but there are many more who have died lonely deaths, by themselves, in the deserts and in the oceans,"" said Doyle.
He added that the nature of the crisis makes it difficult for any organisation or government to keep an accurate count of the dead and missing.
""They [migrants and refugees] are leaving in a clandestine way, they're leaving without papers, and they're leaving in small and dangerous boats. Quite often these boats sink without a trace and nobody actually knows about them,"" said Doyle.

Later in the day, two more convoys comprising over 15 buses left for the countryside to the west, Syrian state television reported.
The evacuation got off to a shaky start. Ibrahim Abu Allaith of the Syrian Civil Defence told Al Jazeera that militias loyal to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad reportedly killed at least one person and injured four more while firing on the first convoy of injured evacuees.
AFP news agency reported that the first batch of convoy was led by vehicles from the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and the Syrian Arab Red Crescent, followed by ambulances and then green government buses.

ICRC spokeswoman Ingy Sedky said the first convoy included 13 ambulances and 20 buses carrying civilians. The World Health Organization (WHO) reported a total of 21 buses and 19 ambulanes had left east Aleppo.
""They have crossed the front line and are on their way to rural parts of western Aleppo,"" Sedky told AFP.
The evacuation on Thursday was part of a ceasefire expected to last three days and result in the transfer of thousands of civilians and fighters from the embattled territory.

Zouhir Al Shimale, an independent journalist in east Aleppo, said the evacuation was still under way despite the attacks on an ambulance.
""There hasn't been fighting since the morning,"" he told Al Jazeera, explaining that ""hundreds of families"" have gathered at the departure point for the buses.
""Civilians are given the choice to stay or leave. If they stay, they'll be under regime control. Most of the people want to go because they are afraid of potential massacres by the regime,"" Shimale added.
""In recent days, people are desperate to get to somewhere where we have the supplies - food, medicine, fuel - like we used to have in the days before the siege. Even if they are in refugee camps, but people still want to leave the besieged area.""
As part of the agreement, the Russian defence ministry said that it was preparing for the transfer of rebel fighters by buses and ambulances to Idlib city, located around 65 kilometres from Aleppo.
Deadly fighting broke out on Wednesday after a similar truce deal collapsed.
Under the initial plan, thousands of civilians and rebel fighters were due to evacuate the east of Syria's second city, scene of some of the worst violence in more than five years of war across the country.
The delay came on Wednesday morning when pro-government Shia militias demanded that civilians in Kafraya and al-Fua - two towns besieged by armed opposition groups - be evacuated, as well.

Thursday's agreement allowed for the evacuation of wounded civilians from Kafraya and Fua, and ambulances were reportedly en route to the two towns by noon local time (10:00 GMT).
Turkey said it would meet with Russia and Iran in Moscow on December 27 to discuss a political solution to the conflict in Syria.
Syria's army has pressed a month-long assault that has seen it take more than 90 percent of the former rebel stronghold in east Aleppo.
Turkey has said those leaving would be taken to Idlib province, which is controlled by a powerful rebel alliance that includes Jabhat Fateh al-Sham.The UN said on Tuesday that it had credible reports of at least 82 civilians, including 11 women and 13 children, being executed in recent days.
And the UN's Commission of Inquiry for Syria said it had received reports opposition fighters were blocking civilians from fleeing Aleppo and using them as human shields.
Aleppo, a cultural and economic hub second only to Damascus in importance, had been split between a rebel-controlled east and government-held west since 2012.
It was unclear how many civilians remained in rebel territory, after an estimated 130,000 fled to other parts of Aleppo during the government advance since mid-November.
Syria's conflict has evolved from largely unarmed protests against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad into a full-scale civil war that has killed hundreds of thousands and displaced more than half of the country's prewar population.

Marwan Kabalan, a Syria analyst and associate political analyst at the Doha Institute, said he expects the Syrian government to focus its attacks on the Damascus suburbs after the fall of Aleppo.
""I think the regime will turn next to targeting the Damascus suburbs,"" he told Al Jazeera. ""Idlib is becoming a point of exile for fighters ... I think it will remain like this till the very end [of the conflict].""
Throughout four years of fighting, Aleppo has seen intense battles that left much of the city in ruins.
AlHakam Shaar, a research fellow at the Budapest-based Aleppo Project , an initiative that tracks the destruction in the historic city, explained that more than 20 percent of Aleppo's buildings were fully destroyed and another 40 percent partially damaged as far back as early 2014.
""The percentages are far higher now. However, there is no way to accurately measure the extent of destruction without a full on the ground survey,"" he told Al Jazeera.
""There will also be a need for planning the rehabilitation of whole systems of infrastructure, from roads to water networks.""

A revived agreement on a ceasefire and the evacuations were announced on Thursday after an initial plan for civilians and fighters to leave rebel-held parts of the city collapsed the previous day amid renewed clashes.
Despite the evacuation, the United Nations warned almost 50,000 remained in the war-torn Syrian city.
The evacuation began with a convoy of ambulances and buses crossing into a government-held district in southern Aleppo at 2:30pm local time (12:30GMT). A slow-moving convoy of two dozen vehicles snaked out of al-Amiriyah district and crossed into government-held Ramussa en route to rebel-held territory in the west of Aleppo province.

Earlier, the evacuees spent hours gathering at a staging area in al-Amiriyah. An AFP news agency correspondent saw people piling on to the green buses, filling seats and even sitting on the floor, with some worried there would not be another chance to flee.
Many were in tears and some hesitated to board, afraid they would end up in the hands of regime forces.
On the dusty window of one of the buses someone had written ""One day we will return"".
Each bus carried a member of the Syrian Red Crescent wearing the organisation's red uniform, riding at the front next to the driver.
As darkness fell over the city, a third convoy was in the process of evacuating more citizens, Syrian state television reported.
But the evacuation got off to a shaky start on Thursday.
Ibrahim Abu Allaith, of the Syrian Civil Defence, told Al Jazeera that militias loyal to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad reportedly killed at least one person and injured four more while firing on the first convoy of wounded evacuees.
AFP reported that the first convoy was led by vehicles from ICRC and the Syrian Arab Red Crescent, followed by ambulances and then the green buses.
The head of the ICRC in Syria, Marianne Gasser, said it could take days to complete the evacuation.
""Right up until the last minute, it wasn't clear we'd get into east Aleppo,"" Gasser said in a statement.
""A crane was used to remove some of the debris from the street so the ambulances and buses could get through. There were burned cars. Smoke rising from nearby buildings. There was a lot of fear and uncertainty.
""When we arrived, the scene was heart-breaking. People are faced with impossible choices. You see their eyes filled with sadness,"" she said.
UN envoy for Syria Staffan de Mistura said about 10,000 people, including fighters, were likely to be evacuated to the rebel-stronghold of Idlib.
""There are about 50,000 people, including 40,000 civilians, that will go to west Aleppo,"" de Mistura said, adding that the remaining 10,000 were made up of between 1,500 to 5,000 fighters and their families.
Zouhir Al Shimale, an independent journalist in east Aleppo, said the evacuation went ahead despite the attacks on the first convoy.
""There hasn't been fighting since the morning,"" he told Al Jazeera, explaining ""hundreds of families"" have gathered at the departure point for the buses.

Meanwhile, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said that he discussed the situation in Aleppo ""several times"" with his Russian and US counterparts, Vladimir Putin and Barack Obama.
He said that he also spoke to German Chancellor Angela Merkel by phone to discuss how Berlin could provide assistance to people in the northern Syrian city.
Marwan Kabalan, a Syria analyst and associate political analyst at the Doha Institute, said he expects the Syrian government to focus its attacks near the capital.

Judges in Catania in Sicily convicted the Tunisian man, Mohammed Ali Malek, on Tuesday of multiple manslaughter counts.
His Syrian crew mate, Mahmud Bikhit, was sentenced to five years in prison and fined nine million euros after being convicted of facilitating illegal immigration.
Prosecutors accused Malek of inadvertently ramming the overloaded fishing boat into the cargo ship that had come to its rescue on April 18, 2015, destabilising it.
The boat flipped after refugees rushed to one side.
Both had claimed they were simple migrants and had been made to steer the boat by the real traffickers.
But survivors told investigators that Malek, who had lived in Italy in the past, was the captain.
They also said it was his lack of sailing skills that caused the deadly collision.
""I spent two years and six months in Italy and I have a young son with an Italian woman: I want to marry her and recognise the baby,"" Malek told the court in a plea before the verdict.
""It's the truth. I've always told the truth. Just as I immediately gave [police] my real name, and told them I was a passenger.""
The boat was carrying people mainly from Gambia, Senegal and Mali, as well as Bangladesh, the Ivory Coast and Ethiopia.
Only 28 survived out of around 850 refugees on board.
Firefighters who recovered the mangled bodies from the rotting ship said they had been ""packed in like on the trains for Auschwitz"".

Busloads of people were due to begin leaving on Wednesday morning as part of a deal with the government, whose forces have effectively taken control of the entire city after weeks of heavy fighting.
No rebel or civilian had left eastern Aleppo as of 5am (03:00 GMT), according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based monitoring group that relies on a network of sources in the country to monitor the war.
""Save Aleppo. Save humanity.""Residents of East Aleppo are giving their final messages to the world. pic.twitter.com/Hzd4VWp0wC
The group did not give a reason for the delay of the evacuation. One Syrian rebel official told the Reuters news agency that pro-government Shia militias were obstructing the departure of people from opposition-held districts in a claim that could not be independently verified.
Zouhir Al Shimale, a journalist in east Aleppo, confirmed the delay, adding that the streets were mostly empty in the morning.
""People here are shocked [by the delay],"" he told Al Jazeera. ""We didn't sleep last night waiting to leave.""
Explaining that civilians are fearful that the evacuation could be yet delayed further, Shimale said: ""No one knows what the regime will do.""
Outside the scope of the evacuation agreement, the Russian government said at least 6,000 civilians were evacuated from eastern Aleppo and 366 rebels laid down their weapons and surrendured within the last 24 hours.

Russia's UN ambassador announced late on Tuesday that all military action in east Aleppo had come to a halt and that the Syrian government was in control of the area.
""Over the last hour we have received information that the military activities in east Aleppo have stopped, it has stopped,"" Vitaly Churkin told a heated emergency UN Security Council meeting.
""The Syrian government has established control over east Aleppo.""
Fears have been growing for thousands of trapped civilians as the opposition fighters make a desperate last stand in their remaining pocket of territory in their former stronghold.
""An agreement has been reached for the evacuation of the residents of Aleppo, civilians and fighters with their light weapons, from the besieged districts of east Aleppo,"" Yasser al-Youssef, from the political office of the Nureddin al-Zinki rebel group, told AFP news agency.
He said the deal was ""sponsored by Russia and Turkey"" and would be implemented ""within hours"".
Huseyin Muftuoglu, a Turkish foreign ministry spokesperson, told Al Jazeera that civilians would first be evacuated from Aleppo, followed by rebels.
""They would move towards Idlib, according to the plan,"" he said. ""There is no plan to take them into Turkey.""
Later on Tuesday, Turkey's Deputy Prime Minister Mehmet Simsek announced his government was planning to set up a new tent city to host ""80,000 people fleeing eastern Aleppo"". He did not specify whether the ""tent city"" would be in Turkey or Syria.
#Turkey, the world's largest refugee hosting country, is to set up a tent city to accommodate up to 80,000 Syrian refugees fleeing #Aleppo.
News of the deal broke just minutes before the Security Council meeting on Aleppo began at UN headquarters in New York.

When asked by reporters shortly after the meeting if the fall of Aleppo was the end of the peace process, Staffan de Mistura, UN Syria envoy, said it ""should be just the opposite"".
""We should be looking at this as a tragic opportunity to restart the political process.""
The UN earlier said that they received reports about pro-government forces executing scores of civilians in Aleppo, including women and children.
Eighty-two people were reportedly killed when Syrian forces took over rebel-held areas, it said.
Forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad have in some cases entered homes and killed those inside, and in others ""caught and killed on the spot"" fleeing civilians, Rupert Colville, the UN rights office spokesman, said on Tuesday.
""The reports that civilians - including children - are being massacred in cold blood in their homes by Syrian government forces are deeply shocking but not unexpected given their conduct to date. Such extrajudicial executions would amount to war crimes,"" Lynn Maalouf, Deputy Director for Research at Amnesty International's Beirut regional office, said.
Haid Haid, a Syrian researcher and associate fellow at Chatham House, said the evacuation deal was more of ""a surrender, not a ceasefire"".
""This situation will be similar to previous situations: rebels and civilians ... would be allowed out, most likely to rural Aleppo or Idlib, and the Syrian regime will take over the rest of Aleppo,"" he told Al Jazeera.
READ MORE: Civilians 'killed on the spot' as battle for Aleppo nears end
But with the Syrian government and its allies making steady progress on the battlefield, many were unsure that any deal would take place, Haid said.
""Negotiations have been ongoing for days now, and now the regime is sure that [it] is winning. So unless there is serious pressure from the international community on Russia on the regime, I think this deal might not even happen because they think they're winning ... why allow [the rebels] out if we can kill the rest of them there and now.""

Sunday's election was called as part of a European Union-brokered deal to defuse a two-year-old political crisis prompted by a phone-tapping scandal.
Monday's results from 99.7 percent of polling stations show the conservative coalition, led by the VMRO-DPMNE party of Nikola Gruevski, the former prime minister, with 38.06 percent of the vote.
The figure put it slightly ahead of the leftist coalition, led by opposition leader Zoran Zaev's Social Democrats (SDSM), which got 36.69 percent.
The electoral commission gave no seat projections.
Without a majority in the 123-seat parliament, the winner will have to try to form a governing coalition with a smaller party.
Both parties on Monday had claimed victory in the snap elections.
""VMRO-DPMNE is the winner of this election,"" Gruevski, who had been Romania's prime minister since 2006, told supporters at the party's headquarters.
However, shortly afterwards the opposition SDSM also claimed victory.
""We are the winners!"" Zaev told a cheering crowd of supporters in front of the government building in central Skopje.
""We have one more seat, we are waiting for the final results ... but the trend is clearly in our favour.""
For voters however, the most important outcome will be to get a government capable of regaining stability after the long political crisis.
Gruevski was forced to step down in January after nearly 10 years in power after allegations of phone tapping, paving the way for Sunday's snap election that saw around 66 percent turnout.
The vote, which was twice delayed owing to international concerns over fraud, pitted Gruevski against his rival Zaev.
It was Zaev. 42, who released the tapes last year that appeared to show the government had tapped the phones of thousands of people, including journalists and religious officials, as well as alleging high-level corruption.
Gruevski denied the claims and accused Zaev of planning a coup with foreign support.
Zaev had pitched the vote as a choice between ""doom or life"" and pledged to stop an exodus of young people from the former Yugoslav republic, which remains one of Europe's poorest countries.

Defeating rebels in Aleppo, however, would not put an end to Syria's conflict, Assad said in an interview with Syrian daily Al-Watan to be published on Thursday, an early copy of which was seen by AFP news agency.
""It's true that Aleppo will be a win for us, but let's be realistic - it won't mean the end of the war in Syria,"" Assad said. ""But it will be a huge step towards this end.""
Since it began in March 2011, the war in Syria has killed hundreds of thousands of people, made more than half of Syrians homeless, and created the world's worst refugee crisis.
Government forces scored an important victory on Wednesday when the rebels retreated from the Old City, the historic heart of Aleppo.
They extended their advances later in the day, seizing the Bab al-Nayrab, Al-Maadi and Salhin neighbourhoods, according to state media.
More neighbourhoods were expected to fall soon, but rebels were fighting ferociously.
The Syrian Civil Defence, a first responder group also known as the White Helmets, said air strikes and shelling on Wednesday killed 61 people in what's left of the rebel-held east of the city.
Syria state television reported late on Wednesday that rebel shelling killed 14 civilians and wounded 70 others, some critically, targeting government-held districts in west Aleppo.
READ MORE: Syria's war - What went wrong in east Aleppo?
In a blistering, three-week offensive, Syrian forces have seized about 80 percent of east Aleppo, a stronghold for rebel groups since 2012.
Increasingly cornered in a pocket of territory in the city's southeast, opposition factions on Wednesday called for an ""immediate five-day humanitarian ceasefire"".
When asked about the possibility of a truce in Aleppo, Assad said: ""It's practically non-existent, of course.""
Assad told Al-Watan: ""The Americans, in particular, are insisting on demanding a truce, because their terrorist agents are now in a difficult situation.""
He said a rebel loss in Aleppo ""will mean the transformation of the course of the war across Syria"".
Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov met US Secretary of State John Kerry in Hamburg late on Wednesday.
""They met for around 45 minutes in the German city of Hamburg where they discussed not only the humanitarian crisis unfolding in east Aleppo, or at least what’s left of east Aleppo, they’re also discussing a deal which would see rebels being able to exit the area,"" Al Jazeera's Imtiaz Tyab said, reporting from Gaziantep along the Turkey-Syria border.
An American official confirmed that the two diplomats discussed the potential safe passage for rebels out of east Aleppo.
An official with an Aleppo-based rebel group, who declined to be named, told Reuters news agency: ""The Russians want the fighters out and they [the Americans] are ready to coordinate over that.""
READ MORE: Government forces push into Aleppo's Old City
While rebels say they could fend off the offensive for some time to come, the fighting is complicated by tens of thousands of fearful civilians trapped in the rebel-held east, many related to the fighters, the official said.
""The civilian burden is very heavy, in a small area.""
As winter sets in, siege conditions are increasingly desperate, exacerbated by increasing numbers of displaced residents and food and water shortages.
A UN official said about 31,500 people from east Aleppo have been displaced around the entire city over the past week, with hundreds more seen on the move on Wednesday.
With hospitals, clinics, water and food cut off, UN chief Ban Ki-moon called the situation was ""heart-breaking"".
Sonia Khush, Save the Children Syria director, said tens of thousands of children in Aleppo have become ""sitting targets"". ""It defies belief that after nearly six years of suffering through this war, the international community is still willing to stand by as civilians are bombed with seeming impunity,"" she added.

Aleppo has been divided between government-controlled neighbourhoods in the city's west and rebel-held areas in the east since 2012.
The Syrian government and its allied forces now control at least three-quarters of the east because of a massive military assault on the besieged area.
Earlier on Thursday, Russian media quoted Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov as saying the Syrian army had halted its attacks on Aleppo to allow for the evacuation of civilians, but there was no confirmation from the UN or the Syrian government.
John Kerry and Lavrov held brief meetings on Wednesday and Thursday on the sidelines of an Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe conference in Hamburg.

While rebels have vowed to continue fighting, the battle is complicated by tens of thousands of fearful civilians trapped in the remaining portions of the rebel-held east.
And as winter sets in, siege conditions are increasingly desperate, exacerbated by increasing numbers of displaced residents and food and water shortages.
Brita Haji Hassan, president of the Aleppo local council, said on Thursday more than 800 people have been killed and 3,000-3,500 wounded in war-devastated eastern Aleppo in the past 26 days.
""Today 150,000 people are threatened with extermination. We are calling for a halt to the bombing and guarantees of safe passage of all,"" Hassan said during a trip to Geneva.
Nearly 150 civilians, most disabled or in need of medical care, were evacuated overnight from a hospital in Aleppo's Old City, the first major evacuation from the eastern sector, the International Committee of the Red Cross said on Thursday.
Among those evacuated from Dar al-Safaa hospital in the Old City - taken over by Syrian government forces on Tuesday - 118 patients were taken to three hospitals in the west of Aleppo and 30 people were taken to shelters, also in the west of the city, the ICRC said in a statement.

The evacuation was conducted jointly with the Syrian Arab Red Crescent, it added.
Speaking to Al Jazeera, ICRC spokesman Pawel Krzysiek said: ""The people were basically trapped there [in recent days].""
""The fighting kind of slowed down starting from yesterday afternoon,"" he continued, adding ""it was too dangerous"" to carry out an evacuation earlier.
""It's first and utmost about the safety of those people [being evacuated] and our priority is to ensure that they will be helped ... and safely transported to a safer place.""
Since it began in March 2011, the war in Syria has killed hundreds of thousands of people, made more than half of Syrians homeless, and created the world's worst refugee crisis.

The suggested policy won Merkel overwhelming applause on Tuesday from about 1,000 delegates ahead of her conservative Christian Democrats' (CDU) party conference vote, which is expected to return her for the ninth time as its chief.
She said the Muslim full-face veil was not compatible with German culture.
""Here we say 'show your face'. So full veiling is not appropriate here. It should be prohibited wherever legally possible,"" she told the crowd to cheers.
A year ago, the CDU rejected such a ban.
READ MORE: German minister proposes partial veil ban
The party has already begun drawing up plans for banning the full veil in areas such as courts, police checks, and while driving vehicles.
Merkel also told delegates that last year's influx of hundreds of thousands of refugees would not happen again.
""A situation like that [in] the summer of 2015 can and should not be repeated,"" Merkel said at the two-day conference in the western industrial city of Essen. ""This was and remains our declared political goal.""
She told the conference refugees had found protection in Germany against war, persecution, and lack of perspective in their troubled homelands. But she also said ""not every refugee can stay"".
Merkel's promises come a month after Donald Trump was elected president of the United States and at a time when Europe is reeling from a surge in far-right populism and Britain's vote to leave the European Union.
Delegates celebrated the chancellor's one-and-half hour speech with an 11-minute standing ovation.
The CDU's moves to forge a stricter approach to refugees at its conference comes in the wake of a string of state election successes by the right-wing populist Alternative for Germany (AfD).
In particular, the AfD has siphoned votes from the CDU after capitalising on anger in parts of the German electorate over Merkel's liberal refugee policy.
Polls show nevertheless that her CDU is the clear frontrunner in the general election, expected in September 2017.
The AfD is currently polling at about 12 percent nationally.
Merkel's government has attempted to address public fears surrounding last year's record influx of nearly 1.1 million refugees and migrants, mostly from predominantly Muslim countries.
Merkel, who has led Germany for 11 years, last month confirmed she would run for a fourth term but acknowledged the election would be ""more difficult"" than any other she has contested.

Yasin Aktay, vice chairman of the ruling AK party, told Al Jazeera the allegations of deadly or excessive force against civilians fleeing the Syrian war were ""fabricated"".
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said in a statement on Tuesday that Turkish snipers had targeted refugees - alleging 163 killings in total, including 31 children and 15 women, since the beginning of 2016.
""The Turkish Ganderma killed dozens of civilians, and beat dozens [of] others leading to permanent deep scars in their bodies, while others were arrested and turned back to the Syrian lands,"" said the Syrian Observatory, a UK-based war-monitor group that relies on activists on the ground for information.

Alktay, however, adamantly denied that Turkey had any ""policies against civilians"".
He added Turkey - which hosts up to three million Syrian refugees - is trying to create a safe zone in a northern Syrian border area as part of an initiative to help ""without them coming to Turkey"".
""We are trying to create a zone free from 'terrorism' and attacks,"" Alktay said.
Raed Fares, a Syrian activist in Idlib, a northeastern Syrian city that borders Turkey, told Al Jazeera he has received many reports of Turkish security forces attacking refugees.
He described one incident in which 11 members of a family - who fled the eastern Syrian province of Raqqa - were shot dead after crossing into Turkey from Idlib province in August.
New York-based Human Rights Watch issued a report in May making similar allegations.
""There have been accusations before, but until now none have been proven,"" Alktay told Al Jazeera, calling them ""baseless"" and ""ungrounded"".

""This is a reflection of a state of humanitarian need in the world not witnessed since the second world war,"" he told a news conference, adding that 80 percent of the needs stemmed from man-made conflicts, such as those in Syria, Iraq, Yemen, Nigeria and South Sudan.
According to Financial Trancing Service (FTS), a UN-managed site tracking humanitarian aid, as of November 30, 2016's humanitarian aid appeals were funded at 51.4 percent.
The World Food Programme (WFT), which has launched an emergency response in Yemen, calculates that millions of people there are on the brink of famine.
Additionally, protracted wars in Syria and Iraq have lead to a crisis of millions of refugees, as well as internally displaced people.
Funding shortfalls for those crises have already left the UN's refugee and children's agencies (UNHCR and UNICEF) struggling to meet the needs of families fleeing violence in great numbers.
The world is now seeing the highest number of refugees and internally displaced populations since World War II.
According to the UNHCR, there are currently 65.3 million people forcibly displaced in the world, with half of them being children.
Roughly 1,000 people have been leaving Mosul each day, where US-backed forces have been fighting ISIL fighters since October.
Syrians have been escaping eastern Aleppo in massive numbers, with 20,000 leaving in 72 hours in late November, as Syrian government forces advance on rebel-held territory in the city.
President Barack Obama held a Leaders' Summit on Refugees in September during the UN General Assembly in New York, where 50 world leaders pledged billions in commitments to help with the crisis.
However, few details have been released in terms of details regarding how much member states will pay, and on what kind of timeline those commitments will be paid.

White House deputy spokesman Eric Schultz told reporters the deal to resettle in the US refugees currently held at Australian-funded offshore detention centres was reached with President Barack Obama, and it was the prerogative of each president to set policies.
""We have one president at a time,"" Schultz said on Friday. ""The president-elect, Donald Trump, will set the policies once he takes the oath of office.""
Turnbull downplayed the comments when questioned by reporters in Sydney on Sunday.
""It's a very good arrangement and we are confident that we'll continue through the change of administration,"" the Australian Associated Press quoted him saying.
Australia announced last month that the Obama administration had agreed to take a substantial number of the 1,200 refugees held on Nauru and Manus Island in Papua New Guinea.
The resettlement deal with the US came after Turnbull agreed in September to take part in a US-led programme to resettle refugees from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador as part of Australia's annual intake of 18,750 asylum seekers.
Whether Trump, who has advocated a ban on people from nations that had been ""compromised by terrorism"", honours the agreement is uncertain.
US homeland security officials were scheduled to begin assessing asylum seekers on Nauru this week.
Many asylum seekers at the camps are Muslims who have fled conflicts in Iraq, Syria, Afghanistan and Pakistan.
Ian Rintoul, from the Refugee Action Coalition, said it was very clear the deal Australia struck with the US was not airtight.
""The announcement was very hastily put together because they weren't expecting Trump to win and then it came very clear the whole deal could roll over,"" he said.

In the early hours of Thursday the group also poured red dye - representing blood - into a fountain in front of the building, the national broadcaster ABC reported.
REPORTER'S NOTEBOOK: Australia's complex refugee debate
The incident came after a protest on Wednesday during which the group stopped parliamentary proceedings for half an hour, shouting slogans and gluing their hands to railings in the public gallery.
The group was protesting specifically against Australia's offshore prisons which hold 1,300 asylum seekers who were picked up trying to reach Australia by boat.
Canberra sends asylum-seekers trying to reach Australia by sea to isolated outposts on Nauru and Papua New Guinea's Manus Island, with the prison conditions widely criticised by refugee advocates and medical professionals.

Speaker Tony Smith suspended question time in what cabinet minister Christopher Pyne said was the most serious intrusion into parliament in 20 years.
The group of around 30 protestors began chanting loudly soon after the session began, shouting ""close the camps"" and ""where is your moral compass?"".
Security tried to remove them as they glued their hands to the railings, with guards using hand sanitiser to help peel them free, television footage showed.

They were eventually removed from the chamber, some forcibly.
The protesters, from the Whistleblowers Activists and Citizens Alliance (WACA) group, said on Wednesday that the country's policy of offshore detention represented a ""state of emergency"".
""Parliament shutdown by @akaWACA #closethecamps #bringthemhere,"" the grassroots alliance said on Twitter.
The group continued their protests on Thursday, inviting everyone in the capital Canberra to join them in front of the parliament.
While the Greens party congratulated the protesters, government Senator James McGrath said on his Facebook page that they were a ""bunch of bong-sniffing, dole-bludging, moss-munching, glue guzzling K-Mart Castros.""

UN special rapporteur Francois Crepeau this month said Australia's ""punitive approach"" to boatpeople had tarnished its human rights record after an 18-day mission that took him across the country and to Nauru.
The government has defended its position as necessary to stem waves of migration by people from Afghanistan, Sri Lanka and the Middle East, with many dying at sea during the treacherous journey.
""I wondered whether we could press on ... we could not,"" said Smith in explaining why he took the rare step of suspending parliament, which resumed some 40 minutes later when the protestors were taken away.

A UN commission on human rights in South Sudan said a steady process of ethnic cleansing was underway in the country, involving massacres, starvation, gang rape and the destruction of villages.
On Wednesday, three commission members who had travelled around South Sudan for 10 days said they observed deepening divisions in a country with 64 ethnic groups.
However, President Kiir strongly denied the allegations on Thursday.
""There's no such thing in South Sudan. There's no ethnic cleansing,"" he told Reuters news agency in the South African city of Johannesburg.
Security guards prevented further questions.
More than one million people have fled South Sudan since the conflict erupted in December 2013 after Kiir fired Riek Machar as vice president.
It is the largest mass exodus of any conflict in central Africa since the 1994 Rwandan genocide.
The fighting has mostly pitted Kiir's Dinkas, the dominant ethnic group estimated to be roughly a third of the population, against Machar's Nuer tribe.
But as fighting has spread to southern border states, known as Greater Equatoria, it has sucked in dozens of other ethnic groups that are also historically in conflict with the Dinka.
More than 4,000 people have been crossing daily into Uganda, where the Bidibidi refugee settlement, open since August, now hosts some 188,000 people.
READ MORE: Ethnic cleansing under way in South Sudan, says UN
Another 36,600 refugees have reached Ethiopia since early September, and more than 57,000 fled to Congo this year.
""We don't have sufficient means to help them,"" said Medard Mokobke Mabe, coordinator for the Red Cross in the Democratic Republic of Congo village of Karukwat, estimating that more than 100 refugees arrive each day.
""There isn't food to eat.""
Casie Copeland, a researcher with the International Crisis Group, said the world had turned a blind eye to the fighting in its newest country, whose independence from Sudan in 2011 was strongly backed by the United States and other Western nations.
""From the war's outset, the UN never tried to maintain a death toll,"" she said.
""Guesses vary from 50,000 up to 300,000. It demonstrates a shocking lack of humanity that no one has tried to establish the scale of violence.""
OPINION: Save South Sudan from destroying itself
UN spokesman Farhan Haq said its mission in South Sudan had faced numerous challenges accessing affected areas, but was doing all it could to establish death tolls and other human rights violations.
The chairman of the commission that travelled to South Sudan, Yasmin Sooka, told a news conference there was ""already a steady process of ethnic cleansing under way in several areas of South Sudan using starvation, gang rape and the burning of villages.
""The stage is being set for a repeat of what happened in Rwanda and the international community is under an obligation to prevent it.""
Sooka then told Al Jazeera there were ""so many different groups of armed actors, including the military who are talking about dealing with a rebellion and putting it down"".
""You have ethnic tensions because people have been displaced from their land based on ethnicity. Everybody believes that a military conflict is almost inevitable in different parts of the country,"" she said.
Sooka described the amount of rape committed by all armed groups in the country as ""mind-boggling"".
""Aid workers describe gang rape as so prevalent that it's become 'normal' in this warped environment. But what does that say about us that we accept this and thereby condemn these women to this unspeakable fate?""

Two years on, she is among thousands of refugees at the Bakassi camp in Maiduguri, the city worst hit by a seven-year-old conflict that has forced more than two million people to flee their homes.
The United Nations says 400,000 children are now at risk from a famine in the northeastern states of Borno, Adamawa and Yobe - 75,000 of whom could die from hunger within the next few months.
A push against the fighters by the Nigerian army and soldiers from neighbouring countries has enabled troops to enter remote parts of the northeast in the past few months, revealing tens of thousands on the brink of starvation - and countless families torn apart.
""I don't know if they are dead or alive,"" Adamu, 35, said of her missing relatives.
There is a renewed threat of Boko Haram attacks. The start of the dry season has seen a surge in suicide bombings, some of which have targeted refugee camps, including one at Bakassi in October which killed five people.
The World Food Programme said it provides food aid to 450,000 people in Borno and Yobe. About 200,000 of them receive $54 each month to buy food, soon to rise to $73.
READ MORE: Boko Haram attacks with children 'suicide bombers'
At least 15 camps, mostly on the outskirts of Maiduguru, the Borno state capital, are home to thousands of people unable to return home and surviving on food rations.
At one known as New Prison, women and children visibly outnumber men, many of whom were killed by Boko Haram or are missing.
One man - Bukaralhaji Bukar, 45, who has eight children from his two wives - said the food he buys with the monthly stipend finishes within two weeks.
""We are suffering. It is not enough,"" said Bukar, who begs on the street to make money.
In the centre of Maiduguri, life seems to be returning to normal. Food markets are bustling but soldiers in pick-up trucks clutching rifles are reminders of the need for vigilance.
In a ward in Molai district near the Bakassi camp, the air is filled with the sound of crying babies and the gurgle of those who lack the energy to cry. Some, whose skin clings tightly to their bones, are silent - too weary to even raise their heads.
""Many of them are malnourished, which is already bad enough, but they also develop things like malaria which further worsens their illnesses because they cannot eat and start vomiting,"" said Dr Iasac Bot, who works at the unit overseen by the charity Save the Children.

Children have conditions ranging from diarrhoea and pneumonia to bacterial infections and skin infections.
Hauwa Malu, 20, fled with her husband and their two-week-old daughter, Miriam, from her village in Jere after Boko Haram fighters burned the farming community to the ground and took their cattle.
Miriam, now aged 10 months, has suffered from fevers, a persistent cough, and is malnourished. Her mother said they have been left without a home or livelihood.
Tim Vaessen, of the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization, said a failure to restore their ability to farm would in the long term mean displaced people would depend on expensive food aid.
""They would remain in these camps, they would become easy targets for other armed groups and they might have to migrate again - even up to Europe,"" he said.

Speaking in a live state-of-the-nation address, Putin said on Thursday that Russia was ready to take part in tackling global challenges - if its interests are respected.
""We don't want confrontation with anyone,"" he said in a speech before officials and lawmakers in the Kremlin.
""Unlike our foreign colleagues who are seeing Russia as an enemy, we have never been looking for enemies - we need friends,"" Putin said.
""But we won't allow any infringement on our interests and neglect of them.""
READ MORE: Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump discuss mending ties
Russia's relations with the West have plummeted to a post-Cold War low over the Ukrainian crisis and the war in Syria.
During the US election campaign, President Barack Obama's administration accused Russia of hacking American political sites and email accounts in an effort to interfere with the vote.
The Kremlin rejected the accusations.
""In the last few years we have faced attempts of foreign pressure with all tools involved - from the myths about Russian aggression, of meddling in elections, to the hounding of our athletes,"" Putin said, referring to doping scandals.
Putin said Russia is looking forward to mending ties with the US after president-elect Donald Trump takes office in January.
""We are ready for cooperation with the new American administration,"" he said.
""It's important to normalise and develop our bilateral ties on an equal and mutually beneficial basis. We share responsibility for ensuring global security and stability and strengthening the non-proliferation regime.""
Trump has spoken favourably of Putin, but has outlined few specifics as to how he would go about recalibrating ties with the country.
Earlier in November, Trump's office said Putin and Trump spoke over the phone to discuss efforts to improve the relationship between Washington and Moscow.
""President-elect Trump noted to President Putin that he is very much looking forward to having a strong and enduring relationship with Russia and the people of Russia,"" Trump's office said in a statement.
""During the call, the two leaders discussed a range of issues, including the threats and challenges facing the United States and Russia, strategic economic issues, and the historical US-Russia relationship that dates back over 200 years.""
OPINION: Will Putin expend Snowden for Trump?
Putin said on Thursday that Moscow hopes to pool efforts with Washington in confronting international terrorism.
""Our servicemen in Syria are fulfilling that task,"" he said.
Russia has conducted an air campaign in support of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, helping his forces to make significant gains, most recently in Aleppo, Syria's largest city before the war.
Putin said Russia is open to a ""friendly and equal dialogue"" about global security.
He pointed to the European refugee crisis as an example of even ""seemingly prosperous countries and stable regions"" facing new divisions.

Terrified civilians have fled empty-handed into remaining rebel-held territory, or crossed into government-controlled western Aleppo or Kurdish-held districts.
The 20,000 figure is an estimate and could increase as ""people are fleeing in different directions"", International Committee of the Red Cross spokesperson Krista Armstrong told the AFP news agency.
United Nations humanitarian chief Stephen O'Brien had earlier put the number of displaced people from eastern Aleppo at 16,000.
The city, which was Syria's biggest before the start of a civil war that has killed hundreds of thousands of people, has been divided between the government-held west and rebel-held east, where UN officials say at least 250,000 people remain under siege.
The Syrian government offensive to recapture the rebel-held parts of Aleppo has sparked international alarm as it intensified this week.
A voluntary rescue group known as the White Helmets reported at least 51 civilians killed in east Aleppo and more than 150 injured during the government assault.
Syrian government forces dropped ""more than 150 air strikes from war planes and helicopters and [fired] more than 1,200 artillery shells"", the group wrote on its Facebook page.

France called for an immediate UN Security Council session on the fighting, which has seen the army capture a third of opposition-controlled east Aleppo in recent days.
The UN Security Council will hold an emergency meeting on Wednesday on the dire humanitarian crisis unfolding in Aleppo, diplomats said.
The 15 ambassadors of the UN Security Council will get a video-conference briefing on the situation in Aleppo by a UN official in charge of humanitarian operation and the UN mediator in Syria, Staffan de Mistura.
""France and its partners cannot remain silent in the face of what could be one of the biggest massacres of civilian population since World War II,"" said France's UN ambassador Francois Delattre on Tuesday.

He and his British counterpart Matthew Rycroft earlier in the day pushed for the emergency council meeting on providing humanitarian relief to the besieged Syrian city.
Eastern Aleppo has been under government siege for more than four months, with international aid stocks exhausted and food supplies running low. Rycroft said the council would discuss plans for the UN to deliver much-needed food and medicine into Aleppo and evacuate the sick and wounded.
""Russia complained that the opposition had not agreed to this plan. Now they have, so I call on Russia to make sure the Syrian regime agrees,"" Rycroft said.
""The future of Aleppo is in the hands of the regime and Russia, and we urge the regime and Russia to stop the bombing and let the aid go through.""
The Syrian conflict started as a largely unarmed uprising against President Bashar al-Assad's rule in March 2011. It has since morphed into a full-on civil war that has killed hundreds of thousands.
The UN refugee agency has registered more than 4.8 million Syrian refugees who have fled the fighting, while another 6.1 million people are internally displaced within the country's borders.

The Syrian Civil Defence, a volunteer rescue group also known as the White Helmets, said at least 45 people, mostly women and children, were killed and more than 50 injured in Jibb al-Qubba on Wednesday by the regime's artillery shelling on those fleeing the conflict.
The state news agency, SANA, published a video on Tuesday appearing to show thousands of civilians boarding buses and leaving east Aleppo safely.
The Red Cross (ICRC), operating on the ground, said at least 20,000 civilians have fled their homes in the past 72 hours, with some making it to shelters in the regime-held western half of the city. Others, it said, are retreating into other neighbourhoods in the east.
""We are so afraid. The army is about five to six kilometres away from us,"" Marwa Taleb, resident of the al-Kallasseh neighbourhood in eastern Aleppo, told Al Jazeera.
""The exodus is extreme in every meaning of the word. Many from Hanano and Sakhour, where the army has advanced, are coming into our neighbourhoods. There is so much anxiety and fear.""
Earlier this month, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's forces intensified their push for control over eastern Aleppo. They have reportedly captured a third of the area in what residents describe as an unrelenting ground and air campaign.
The city, which was once Syria's largest, has been divided between government and opposition control since 2012.
The UN reports that at least 250,000 civilians remain under siege in the eastern part of Aleppo. For months, they have faced severe shortages of basic supplies, including food, water and fuel, in addition to constant bombardment.
A network of activists across Syria, the Local Coordination Committees, said that a total of 100 Syrians were killed on Monday and Tuesday in Aleppo, as the government and its ally, Russia, close in on the neighbourhoods of al-Myassar, Bab al-Nairab, al-Salheen and Sha'ar in the east.

With fighting edging closer to their homes, many civilians have sought refuge in two main shelters, Jibreen and Mahalej, set up by the ICRC and the Syrian Arab Red Crescent (SARC) in the west of the city.
""Local authorities and humanitarian organisations do everything possible to help but the conditions are very dire, as we are talking about some 20,000 people fleeing into these places,"" Pawel Krzysiek, the ICRC's communication coordinator, said.
""They are safe, though many of them are exhausted and traumatised by the journey, danger, [and] emotions of having to leave everything behind.""
But as the situation descends into chaos and confusion, Taleb said she and her family are apprehensive to move into areas under government control.

Up to 1,400 invited members are expected to design the movement's strategy for the next five years. The congress will also elect Fatah's 23-member Central Committee, presided by Abbas, and its 132-member Revolutionary Council.
Abbas is said to be under pressure from Arab states to name a successor. Fatah officials, however, insist that the congress ""is not about succession"".
""The congress will discuss and review the tools that have been used to achieve two goals: establishing a free and sovereign state and the right of return which remain our national goals,"" said Husam Zomlot, Abbas' strategic adviser and newly appointed ambassador to the United States.
""A major review should be about bilateralism and successive Israeli governments' insistence to use negotiations as a tool to expand and reinforce the occupation and colonisation,"" Zomlot told Al Jazeera.
The congress, according to Zomlot, will also address strategic alternatives, including the issue of internationalisation of popular resistance, of boycott and sanctions as well as resorting to the International Criminal Court (ICC).
READ MORE: Local Palestinian elections 'referendum on Abbas rule'
Formerly led by Yasser Arafat, Fatah remains the dominant party in both the PLO (Palestine Liberation Organisation), which led the Palestinians to the Oslo Accords with Israel in 1993 and 1995, and the PA (Palestinian Authority). The latter was created as a provisional government as part of the Oslo process, which envisaged a five-year interim period to pave the way to final status negotiations.
But some analysts have expressed concern about the timing of the congress, with political tensions running high; while others have pointed to the need to forward-plan towards Abbas' succession to avoid a power vacuum that could lead to serious destabilisation and the imposition of outside agendas. The 81-year-old Palestinian president was recently hospitalised with heart problems, and his term in office officially expired in 2009.
Abbas is both limiting the number of people who can attend, including cutting out longtime Fatah members, and replacing them with people who will simply say 'yes' to Abbas and his failed policies.
Diana Buttu, lawyer and former PLO adviser
But while Zomlot insists the congress is not about succession but rather about ""submitting each commissioner's report"" and assessing their work, analysts have been worried about developments on the ground.
Middle East peace envoy Nikolay Mladenov said during a rare visit to Balata refugee camp in the Nablus governorate earlier this month that he was worried the situation in the camp could ""explode"", referring to the clashes between Palestinian security forces and alleged criminals operating in the camp.
PA raids into Palestinian refugee camps, including Jenin and Al Amari, have intensified in the lead-up to the congress, as they did around the now-postponed municipal elections, originally planned for October 8.
On October 22, PA security forces broke up a meeting organised by a group of Fatah leaders in Al Amari refugee camp near Ramallah, which resulted in a number of arrests and ousters from the movement.
They are said to be supporters of senior Fatah leader Mohammed Dahlan, who was expelled from the movement over criminal allegations in 2011.
Dahlan, 55, was former head of the PA's security services in Gaza and has been living in exile in the United Arab Emirates since 2012. He is reported to be keen to make a comeback and challenge Abbas' rule.
Arrests reportedly also took place among Fatah's ""Shabiba"" youth movement, mostly based in universities.
""Fatah is in complete disarray,"" lawyer and former PLO adviser Diana Buttu told Al Jazeera. ""This congress should have taken place two years ago and would not have taken place at all were it not for Abbas' attempts to further consolidate his power.
""Abbas is both limiting the number of people who can attend, including cutting out longtime Fatah members, and replacing them with people who will simply say 'yes' to Abbas and his failed policies.""
Observers point out that the last congress was attended by about 2,000 people.
""Today, more than ever, we are in need of new strategies and a political programme that will both unite Palestinians and challenge Israel's rule,"" Buttu said.
Hugh Lovatt, Israel/Palestine project coordinator at the European Council on Foreign Relations, believes the rise in violence is to be seen through the lens of the power struggle in view of the post-Abbas era.
""One can already imagine a concerted effort by Israel and other Arab states to try to push Dahlan forward,"" Lovatt told Al Jazeera, adding that Dahlan remains the favoured candidate of Lieberman and the Arab Quartet (Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Jordan and the UAE). The latter have been pressuring Abbas to let his arch rival return from exile and unify Fatah.
""If one wants to talk about a successor to Abbas, then it would be the moment for healing Fatah, and getting a candidate that would be acceptable to Abbas' camp, and to Dahlan's camp,"" Lovatt told Al Jazeera, adding that he didn't believe this was likely to happen.
Hamas, meanwhile, has allowed Dahlan to get a foothold in Gaza, and in return Egypt has loosened some of the restrictions on access and movement it imposed on the Strip.
""When we talk about the EU, there has not yet been any serious thinking at policy level about the day after President Abbas,"" Lovatt said. ""And so the risk is that one day we find President Abbas is no longer president, and everyone is left scrambling. And this could see the EU and other states falling back on the usual reaction to support the strongman candidate at the expense of democratic representation.""
OPINION: The year of Palestinian leadership change has begun
Neither Abbas nor Dahlan fare well in Palestinian public opinion polls. According to the latest poll conducted by the Palestinian Centre for Policy and Survey Research (PSR) and published at the end of September, 61 percent of Palestinians want Abbas to resign, down from 65 percent in the previous three months.
Only 5 percent of respondents would want to see Dahlan replace Abbas following an election in which the current president does not nominate himself. Jailed Fatah leader Marwan Barghouti gets the highest consensus at 37 percent, followed by Hamas' Ismail Haniyeh at 19 percent.
""For the Palestinians, Dahlan or Abbas - there is no difference, at least for the majority,"" political analyst Hamada Jaber told Al Jazeera.
Alaa Tartir, programme director at Al-Shabaka, highlighed six main issues he thinks the Fatah leadership should consider during the congress if the political will existed.
These include creating a real distinction between Fatah and the PA; establishing clear accountability mechanisms to assess the performance of the leadership; caring about the cadre as much the elite care about themselves and their positions; bridging the trust and legitimacy gap as well as taking measures to reverse the damage that Fatah caused the Palestinian struggle, especially with its role in the intra-Palestinian divide and fragmentation; fighting the entrenched corruption from its root causes; and finally fighting authoritarianism instead of being complicit in sustaining it.
""These are doable policy prescriptions if the aim is to trigger genuine reform processes that yield to positive consequences on the Palestinian struggle for liberation and self-determination.""

Soldiers only occasionally open the gate to allow civilians to bring supplies to relatives inside, as authorities struggle to accommodate some 1,000 people fleeing the fighting every day since Iraqi forces launched a campaign to expel the armed group.

US-backed Iraqi government troops and Kurdish security forces have launched the biggest battle in Iraq since the 2003 US-led invasion to drive ISIL fighters from Mosul, the group's last major bastion in the country, many times larger than any other city the fighters have held.
The UN is asking donors to fund winter kits for 1.2 million people - preparing for a worst case scenario that much of the city's population may have to flee. Seventy-two thousand have fled so far, and winter has brought freezing temperatures.
The Kurdish authorities are requiring fleeing civilians to stay in camps even if they have family outside, so that males can be checked for ties to ISIL. Relatives crowded out front, bringing blankets and pillows.
""My relatives have ice on their tent at night,"" said Salah, as he waited for his cousins and their five children to pick up the bags. ""They don't get enough blankets so I brought them from my house.""
Salah escaped Mosul for Kurdish-held Erbil, 60km east of the city, when ISIL swept through the area in June 2014. The rest of his family fled two weeks ago.
Males who have been displaced have to hand over their ID cards on the day they arrive.
""I want to stay with my family in Erbil, but they keep us here,"" said a young man, who gave his name only as Hisham, standing in front of a tent with his veiled wife and baby.
""I have been waiting for three weeks,"" he said.
The two main camps, Hasan Sham camp hosting 10,800, and the nearby Khazer camp home to 29,000, are full.
The United Nations refugee agency UNHCR started work on Sunday on another camp nearby, clearing the ground of landmines to set up 1,600 tents. Government workers are also setting up more blue tents at the Hasan Sham camp.
UNHCR told Al Jazeera in the lead up to the Mosul offensive that setting up camps in advance was impossible as it was feared tents would be stolen. Finding suitable land for the camps had proved a major challenge.
The UN has opened another camp in Tikrit, south of Mosul, while near Tal Afar in the west, a flashpoint town where thousands of people have fled, another camp will be launched this week, the UNHCR said.
Expecting a longer stay as the battle drags on, many families bring in stoves and kitchen utensils. With soldiers turning back most people at the camp gate, dozens threw their bags over the fence.
Parents were registering children to attend schools inside the camps, often their first opportunity for regular schooling in years.
""Children lost two years because schools were closed under Daesh or taught only Islamic law,"" said a teacher who gave his name as Ali, who was using the Arabic acronym for ISIL.
Having himself fled ISIL, he applied to work in the camp schools. His own village is only 500 metres away, but the army has not opened it to civilians yet because the frontline is still too close.
""The children need to go back to school while we wait here.""
