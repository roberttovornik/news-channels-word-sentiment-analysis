The parents of six minors, all currently travelling north through southern Mexico, are the plaintiffs in a civil action filed Thursday in a District of Columbia court against Trump and nine top Trump administration officials.
The suit claims Trump ""continues to abuse the law, including constitutional rights, to deter Central Americans from exercising their lawful right to seek asylum in the United States"".
Thousands of Central American migrants and refugees are collectively fleeing north. The Mexican government is processing more than 2,000 requests for asylum. Thousands more are expected to continue to travel north to request asylum in the United States.
An initial caravan departed from Honduras last month and is now making its way through the southern Mexican state of Oaxaca. Other large groups from Honduras and El Salvador are following behind them up through Guatemala and Mexico.
At a press conference Thursday, Trump reiterated his administration's intentions to take drastic measures in response to the caravans.
Trump suggested that any rocks thrown at US troops will be considered equivalent to rifles, allowing troops to engage with live ammunition. More than 5,000 members of the US military have already been deployed to the border, and their total number could surpass 15,000, according to Trump.
In the same press conference, Trump also made said his administration is finalising plans that would include potentially denying asylum claims if migrants and refugees cross in between ports of entry. He said the government is also working to build ""massive"" tent facilities to hold members of the caravan and no one will be released while their asylum cases are being processed.
""Trump's professed and enacted policy towards thousands of caravanners seeking asylum in the United States is shockingly unconstitutional,"" according to the class complaint, Pineda v Trump, filed Thursday in the District Court of the District of Columbia.
The civil action on behalf of children in the caravan was filed against Trump, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Customs and Border Protection (CBP), US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), top officials for all of those agencies, and US Attorney General Jeff Sessions.
The civil action is based on the Flores Agreement, a 1997 court settlement agreement that mandated certain conditions for the detention of minors by immigration authorities and their treatment in custody.
The legally binding agreement requires facilities housing detained minors to be run by licensed programmes and provide toilets, drinking water, contact with family, and adequate temperature control and ventilation, among other conditions.
The impossibility of adequate temperature control and ventilation in tent camp facilities - and their potential administration as unlicensed programmes - in the desert southwest are just two of the issues raised in the Thursday's complaint, which seeks an immediate injunction and class certification.
Trump's announcements of extreme measures planned in response to the thousands of migrants and refugees fleeing north has drawn widespread condemnation from human rights groups.
""Right now, mothers, fathers, and children are enduring a terrible and arduous journey because they urgently need to find safe haven from violence and persecution,"" Amnesty International Secretary-General Kumi Naidoo said in a statement Friday.
""Seeking asylum is a fundamental human right. I would like to remind President Trump that US law states very clearly that it does not matter where or how people seeking safe haven enter the country - they are allowed to apply for asylum. His intentions to limit the rights of those seeking asylum are against those laws and the USA's international obligations,"" said Naidoo.

""Illegal immigrant, Luis Bracamontes, killed our people!"" reads the opening line of the 53-second video, referring to a Mexican citizen who was sentenced to death over the 2014 killing of two police deputies in California.
""Democrats let him stay,"" continues the video, which had more than 2.7 million views by midday on Thursday.
The video weaves back and forth between images of Bracamontes and footage showing the Central American migrant caravan.
""Who else would Democrats let in?"" the ad concludes rhetorically, adding: ""President Donald J Trump and Republicans are making America safe again.""
Trump, who has sought to drum up fear of immigrants before the November 6 vote, tweeted the video with the text: ""It is outrageous what the Democrats are doing to our Country. Vote Republican now!""
He tweeted the video on the same day that he announced that up to 15,000 US troops could be deployed to the US-Mexico border in response to the caravan, which is still deep inside Mexican territory and far from the frontier. More than 5,000 troops are already headed there.
Many of the migrants and refugees on the initial wave caravan, which left Honduras more than two weeks ago, have told Al Jazeera they are fleeing violence, poverty and poor healthcare. Those who do eventually make it to the US border plan to apply for asylum at an official port of entry.
Throughout the midterm season, several Republican campaigns and right-wing Super PACs have run controversial anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim ads.
But Wednesday's ad was among the most blatantly racist and drew comparisons to an infamous right-wing PAC commercial for former President George HW Bush's successful 1988 campaign against Democrat Michael Dukakis.
That ad focused on William Horton, a man convicted murderer who committed kidnapping and rape after running away while out of prison on furlough. Civil rights groups later lambasted the ad as a racist appeal to white voters.
In 1988, the controversial Horton ad was produced and broadcast by an outside Super PAC, but unlike the Bush campaign, President Trump endorsed and promoted Wednesday's anti-immigrant video.
Critics lashed out at Trump over the video.
Response of @JeffFlake to this new Trump ad: “This is just a new low in campaigning. It’s sickening.” https://t.co/f6oyjId6O7
According to CNN's Jake Tapper, Jeff Flake, a Republican Senator from Arizona, decried the video as ""a new low in campaigning"" and ""sickening"".
University of California Berkeley professor Robert Reich, who served as US Secretary of Labor from 1993 to 1997, called the ad ""fearmongering"" on Twitter. ""This may be the most desperate and vile ad since Willie Horton,"" he wrote.
This may be the most desperate and vile ad since Willie Horton. Trump and Republicans don't want to talk about the fact that they plan to repeal the ACA, gut Social Security, Medicare, & Medicaid, and cut taxes even further for their donors, so they've resorted to fearmongering. https://t.co/xaXNThEOfb
Critics have accused Trump of employing rhetoric that incites violence, threats and hatred.
In recent weeks, the president baselessly claimed that the US-bound caravan included ""unknown Middle Easterners"" and ""criminals"".
On Saturday, a gunman stormed a synagogue in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, where he shot dead 11 Jewish worshipers.
Trump denounced the violence. But the alleged attacker cited as motivation the caravan and recycled far-right conspiracy theories which claim that Jews are behind immigration.
On the Monday before the massacre, Trump addressed a campaign rally in Texas by claiming he is a ""nationalist"" fighting against ""power-hungry globalists"".
Speaking to Al Jazeera at the time, experts pointed out that the term ""globalist"" has roots in far-right conspiracy theories that carry thinly-veiled anti-Semitic undertones.
In an interview with Axios, which aired on Tuesday, Trump vowed to do away with birthright citizenship, falsely claiming that he could abolish the constitutional right through executive order.
He also inaccurately claimed that the US is the only country in the world that grants automatic citizenship to people born on its soil.

The tattered paper travelled nearly 1,400km with her from her hometown of Tegucigalpa, Honduras to Tonala in Chiapas, Mexico.
""They killed him right in front of me,"" Melendez said, recalling the moment gang members burst into her family's home more than three years ago.
Melendez was pregnant and she and her four children were at home asleep at the time.
The death certificate includes very little information. Fredis de Jesus Ferrera Lemus. Age 31. National identification number. Parent's names. Date and location of death. The cause of death is listed as ""violent"", and underneath it, the document briefly expands on the cause, stating that it was craniofacial trauma from a gunshot wound.
But the document could become vitally important as she makes her way to the US border to apply for asylum.
Melendez is one of thousands of Honduran and other Central American migrants and refugees on a US-bound caravan currently in southern Mexico.
She has no idea why her husband, a rubbish truck worker, was killed, and she does not expect to ever know. Ninety percent of homicides in Honduras go unsolved. ""It was left at that. When you're poor, deaths remain in impunity. It is a very dangerous neighbourhood,"" Melendez said.
Many Hondurans are fleeing violence, whether it is gang-related, political, or for other reasons. Many are also looking to leave a life of poverty and unemployment. And some migrants and refugees are fleeing because they or their children suffer from disabilities or health conditions that require attention they are unable to obtain in Honduras.
Melendez left for all three of those reasons. Her brother Jimy, who is also travelling with the group, suffers from speech and hearing problems. The cause is unknown and gang members have been trying to recruit the 28-year-old.
One of Melendez's sons also has special needs due to a primary immunodeficiency health condition, diagnosed two years ago. Now six years old, Joshua Eliel Ferrera Melendez has juvenile onset Still's disease. A form of systemic arthritis with no known cause, the disease affects the entire body, sometimes including internal organs.
Along with her husband's death certificate, Melendez also carries a clinical summary of Joshua's condition and treatment.
Orvelina Lizeth Melendez, Honduran asylum seeker
There is no known cure for Still's disease, but managing the condition requires ongoing treatment. Joshua requires several medications, but the main treatment is human immunoglobulins administered intravenously every month at the hospital. Manufactured from blood plasma, immunoglobulins contain antibodies Joshua lacks.
""My son is very special and I do not have the means to give him the medications. The medicines are very expensive,"" Melendez said, her voice slightly cracking.
Melendez was forced to leave Joshua, along with three of her other children, with her mother. She said there's no chance he would have survived the journey.
For Melendez, finding work in the US is the best option for making enough money to support her family and provide for Joshua's care.
Hospital Escuela, the public hospital where Joshua receives his treatment, has been chronically understaffed and under-equipped for years. The building leaks, it is nearly always over capacity and patients and their relatives often have to go elsewhere to buy medications and basic supplies for procedures, including syringes.
Sometime Hospital Escuela has the human immunoglobulins Joshua needs, but sometimes it does not. Each monthly treatment is $830 and the hospital asks Melendez to pay for a quarter of the cost.
Although doctors and social workers sometimes help with the cost, Melendez questioned how a single mother of five was supposed to earn $200 for treatment, in addition to providing for her family.
""That's the main reason I am travelling today: to give my children a better life and to better feed my family in Honduras,"" she said.
Melendez, along with her other family members in the caravan, including Jimy, have heard bits and pieces of US President Donald Trump administration's characterisation of the migrant caravan, as well as the measures the US government is taking to stop them from crossing the border from Mexico.
Earlier this week, the administration announced more than 5,000 US military troops are being sent to the border in preparation of the caravan. Trump said on Wednesday that number could grow to more than 15,000.
Those troops will likely meet a fraction of the caravan participants, most of whom are only carrying a small bag on their backs. Melendez brought a small bag and now also has a few things stashed in the back of a stroller donated along the way. Most of her belongings, including the stroller, are to clothe and care for her four-year-old daughter she brought with her.
The caravan is also still more than 1,000km away. And those who do make it, plan on applying for asylum at an official port of entry.
Despite the threat, Melendez and most of the others are undeterred.
""We are not criminals. We are not going to commit crimes. We just want to go work,"" she said.
""We are going to continue. We are going to head north.""

Tuti Tursilawati was executed on Monday in the city of Taif, Indonesia's foreign ministry said, seven years after she was sentenced to death for killing her employer in an act she claimed was self-defence from sexual abuse. President Joko Widodo criticised the decision on Wednesday, saying the government has officially protested to Riyadh and demanded better protection of Indonesian workers in the country. Lalu Muhammad Iqbal, director at the foreign ministry's Indonesian citizens protection department, told reporters on Tuesday the move was ""regrettable"". ""The execution of Tuti Tursilawati was done without notification to our representatives, either in Riyadh or Jeddah,"" he said at a news conference. Tursilawati claimed she was acting in self-defence when she killed her employer in 2010 after he tried to rape her. Migrant Care, an NGO advocating for the rights of Indonesian workers abroad, condemned the execution and urged the government to take serious diplomatic steps. It said Indonesia should reverse its recent decision to allow a limited number of Indonesian migrant workers to Saudi Arabia despite a 2015 moratorium banning new domestic workers from entering 21 Middle Eastern countries.
Indonesia introduced the ban following the execution of two other Indonesian maids by Saudi Arabia the same year. Drug trafficking, rape, murder, apostasy and armed robbery are all punishable by death under Saudi Arabia's strict version of Islamic law. As well as the Middle East, Indonesia also sends domestic workers to many parts of Asia, including Singapore, Hong Kong and Malaysia, and has often complained about the treatment of its workers abroad.
GCC countries have come under fire over its controversial Kafala system of sponsorship for migrant workers, which is used to varying extents in different countries across the region.
It restricts most workers from moving to a new job before their contracts end unless they obtain their employer's consent, trapping many workers in abusive situations.
International rights and labour groups have called for comprehensive laws to protect migrant labourers and reforming the kafala system.
And according to Human Rights Watch several Gulf countries have slowly improved the labour protections for migrant domestic workers.

FIFA President Gianni Infantino said on Wednesday that the expansion, which is slated for the 2026 World Cup in the United States, Canada and Mexico, could come early at the next event.
""We have decided as well to increase the number of teams participating in the World Cup final tournaments, from 32 to 48. This will happen in 2026. Will it happen already in 2022? We are looking into it. If it is possible, why not?"", said Infantino, speaking at the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) Congress in the Malaysian capital, Kuala Lumpur.
Qatar beat bid rivals Australia, Japan, South Korea and the US in 2010 to claim the hosting rights, becoming the first Arab country to do so.
One of its stated aims was to create a legacy for the Middle East, but last year, its Gulf neighbours Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Bahrain severed political and economic ties with Qatar, imposing a land, sea and air embargo on the peninsula.
""We have to see if it is possible, if it is feasible,"" said Infantino about the potential expansion in four year's time.
""We are discussing with our Qatari friends, we are discussing with our many other friends in the region and we hope that this can happen,"" he added.
""And, if not, we will have tried. We will have tried because we always have to try to do things in a better way.""
Infantino's favoured plan of adding 16 extra teams - with 16 three-team groups - to football's mega event was unanimously approved by the FIFA Council last year.
The 2026 tournament in North America is set to be the first World Cup hosted by three nations.
Preparations are under way in Qatar, which is breaking with tradition with a winter kick-off, as it looks to avoid the scorching summer heat.
Seven new state-of-the-art stadiums with advanced open-air cooling technology are being built for the 2022 event.
The eighth one, Khalifa International Stadium, was inaugurated in May last year, after undergoing renovations and upgrades.
Qatar's Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani has said that Qatar 2022 is ""very important for the whole region"" and hopes that the football tournament will help the Arab nations ""overcome difficulties"".
Earlier this year, South American countries had formally asked FIFA to make Qatar 2022 a 48-team event.
But Nasser al-Khater, assistant secretary-general of the Supreme Committee for Delivery and Legacy (SC), which is overseeing the 2022 World Cup, said Qatar is still planning and working towards a 32-team tournament.
""Technically speaking, everything is possible,"" he told Al Jazeera. ""It's just that we need to understand the format, how it's going to change, how many days would be increased for the 48-team World Cup and we take it from there.""
""We are going to keep an open-door policy as we have been,"" al-Khater added. ""We welcome everybody to come to Qatar and we still remain a Middle Eastern World Cup.""
Analysts have warned that the expansion of Qatar's tournament would present a fresh batch of problems to a host nation that has already been the subject of much condemnation over migrant workers' rights and its winter schedule.
""How would Qatar - already working around the clock to cater for the needs of 32 nations, 64 games and the hundreds of thousands of fans eager to support their teams - allow for another 16 teams, not forgetting, of course the extra games and extra fans it would have to host in the allotted schedule?,"" wrote Ross Griffin, assistant professor of Postcolonial Literature at Qatar University.
Al Jazeera's sports correspondent Lee Wellings, reporting from London, said Infantino's latest remarks are driven more by FIFA's internal politics than anything else.
""He [Infantino] is standing in Kuala Lumpur and talking to people who want to hear that there's a chance for more teams in a tournament which is happening in their continent, so he knows he's preaching to the converted,"" he said.
""What he also believes, somewhere at the back of his mind, is that he can actually make a political difference, rather like Sepp Blatter [ex-FIFA president] before him,"" Wellings said.
""But when it comes to trying to sort out situations in the Middle East ... to actually make this happen is way beyond Infantino and FIFA.""

The move comes amid President Donald Trump's repeated threats against the caravan, including cutting off aid to Central American countries and Mexico if they do not block the refugees and migrants.
""Sending active military forces to our southern border is not only a huge waste of taxpayer money, but an unnecessary course of action that will further terrorise and militarise our border communities,"" said Shaw Drake of the American Civil Liberties Union's border rights centre at El Paso, Texas.
Now around 1,200km from the US border, the initial wave of refugees and migrants left Honduras more than two weeks ago. Estimates vary, but anywhere from 3,500 to more than 7,000 people are now part of the first group heading north through Mexico. Smaller groups have since left Honduras and El Salvador and hundreds of migrants and refugees crossed the Suchiate River between Guatemala and Mexico on foot Monday after being pushed back by Mexican authorites the day before.
Many of the participants told Al Jazeera they are fleeing violence and economic instability, including unemployment.
Critics say the Trump administration has drummed up fear around the caravan in order to rally voters behind his anti-immigration agenda ahead of the November 6 midterm elections.
""The migrant caravan is full of women and children fleeing violence, poverty and government repression,"" tweeted Democratic Senator Ed Markey from Massachusetts. ""Sending thousands of troops to turn them away as if they are foreign invaders reflects the profound paranoia, fear and hate fueling this administration's immigration policies.""
Trump has called the caravan an ""invasion"" and without evidence, said ""Middle Easterners"" and ""gang members"" are among its participants.
On Monday, Air Force General Terrence O'Shaughnessy, the Northern Command leader, told reporters that that 800 troops were already on their way to southern Texas. Explaining that the number will reach 5,200 by the end of the week, he said “Operation Faithful Patriot” will focus on Texas first, then Arizona and California.
There are already about 2,000 National Guardsmen on the US's southern border, but now advanced helicopters will enable border protection agents to swoop down on migrants, O’Shaughnessy said. The military troops are intended to assist the border patrol, not engage directly with migrants, he added.
The caravan's goal is to seek asylum at an official port of entry, however.
Migrants are entitled under both US and international law to apply for asylum, but it may take while to make a claim.
Caravans coming from Central America have made their way to the US border for years without much fanfare. Migrants and refugees often leave in groups for safety purposes. This month's caravan is unusual for its large size, however, and those travelling north seem to be so far undeterred by the president's threats.
In April, a caravan that had about 1,500 people at its peak also caught Trump’s ire. Many of its participants attempted to stay in Mexico and only a few hundred people continued to the US border, seeking asylum at an official port of entry, rights groups said.
According to the New York Times, about 400 were referred to the US for ""credible fear"" interviews. Many who passed that step are still awaiting further immigration hearings.
Rights groups also argue that there is little evidence to suggest that increasing border restrictions has an effect on individuals decision to flee their country.
""In many cases we are talking about people who have no choice but to leave their homes, and people who will continue to keep trying to find a safe place to live, despite the policies of Mexico, the USA, or any other country that may be safer than theirs,"" Amnesty said in a statement last week.
""The hardline border controls used by a series of US governments over the last 30 years have been shown to be ineffective at reducing migration and only condemn people to more precarious and dangerous routes that put human lives at risk and fuel smuggling network,"" the international rights organisation added.
Michelle Mittelstadt, director of communications of the Migration Policy Institute, said ""there is no crisis at the border"".
""We believe that the US is capable of dealing with the caravan without such extraordinary measures, and that is well within the capacity of the government to determine among those arriving at the border who has a legitimate protection claim and who does not,"" she told Al Jazeera, adding that overall activity at the border is a ""mere fraction"" of what it was in the 1990s and early 2000s.
The White House is also weighing additional border security measures, including blocking those travelling in the caravan from seeking legal asylum and keeping them from entering the US.
The escalating rhetoric and expected deployments come as the president has been trying to turn the caravan into a key election issue with just days to go before the midterm elections that will determine whether Republicans maintain control of Congress.
""This will be the election of the caravans, the Kavanaughs, law and order, tax cuts, and you know what else? It's going to be the election of common sense,"" Trump said at a rally in Illinois on Saturday night.
Trump, attempting to fulfill a number of campaign promises to crackdown on immigration, has implemented a ""zero tolerance"" policy at the border, drawing strong criticism from rights groups. Earlier this year, Trump was forced to end his administration's practice of separating children from their families at the border after public outcry. Hundreds of families remain separated.
The president's dark description of the caravan belied the fact that any migrants who complete the long trek to the southern US border already face major hurdles, both physical and bureaucratic, to being allowed into the United States.
The Mexican, Guatemalan and Honduran governments also fortified their respective borders and increased security, attempting to turn back the migrants and refugees or keep them within from moving further north.
Rights groups said the responses may violate international law.
On Sunday, a Honduran man was killed when Mexico federal police used rubber bullets and tear gas on a large group of migrants and refugees attempting to force their way across the Guatemala's border with Mexico. Mexican officials denied using rubber bullets, but refugees and migrants, as well as the media, including Al Jazeera witnessed federal police shooting rubber bullets during Sunday's confrontation.

Two African Americans killed at a supermarket. More than a dozen pipe bombs mailed to prominent Democrats and CNN.
As President Donald Trump and Republicans escalated campaign rhetoric, much of it anti-migrant and anti-Muslim, deadly attacks and threats of violence marred the lead-up to the midterm elections.
Experts say it is one of the most violent election campaigns in living memory, and critics lay much of the blame on the president.
Heidi Beirich heads the Intelligence Project at the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), an Alabama-based hate monitor. In her decades of experience, she cannot recall a pre-election tide of violence as worrisome as the one pouring over the US right now.
""This is three major attacks, the last being the most devastating, in just a few days right before an election,"" she told Al Jazeera, explaining that uptick in hate crimes and far-right violence have traditionally followed elections rather than preceded them.
On Saturday, a gunman stormed the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburg, Pennsylvania, and perpetrated what has been described as the deadliest assault on the American Jewish community in the country's history. ""All Jews must die!"" he reportedly screamed, while unloading a barrage of bullets that killed 11 worshippers during prayer time.
Police quickly arrested 46-year-old Robert Bowers, a frequent poster on the Gab social media platform, where he reportedly announced his intent to carry out the massacre just hours earlier.
Although Bowers criticised Trump, he shared the president's anger over a US-bound caravan of Latin American migrants and refugees.
The massacre came just a day after police arrested Cesar Sayoc, who they believe mailed more than a dozen pipe bombs to outspoken critics of Trump.
The recipients were frequent targets of far-right ire: former President Barack Obama, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Hungarian-American billionaire George Soros and US Congresswoman Maxine Waters, among others.
Sayoc's now-suspended Twitter accounts teemed with pro-Trump posts, conspiracy theory memes and often violent threats to journalists and others.
And as authorities intercepted explosive packages across the nation, a murder occurred in Louisville, Kentucky on Wednesday. A white man allegedly shot and killed two black shoppers at a Kroger supermarket after failing to break into a predominantly African American church. ""Whites don't kill whites,"" the suspect reportedly told a bystander.
From the earliest days of his presidential campaign, Trump faced accusations that his rhetoric fueled racism, xenophobia and violence.
Although hate crimes were nothing new, Trump's ascent to power sent them soaring as far-right groups rallied behind his message. During the 10 days following his election, the SPLC documented nearly 900 reports of ""harassment and intimidation"" across the US, with many of the assailants declaring their support for Trump.
A steady stream of violence, clashes between far-rightists and anti-fascists, and a deadly white supremacist rally in Virginia punctuated Trump's first year in office.
White supremacists killed at least 18 people in 2017, according to the Anti-Defamation League.
Daryle Lamont Jenkins, One People's Project
Even with last year's string of hate crimes, confrontations and brawls across the nation, the current spate of violence shocks Daryle Lamont Jenkins, who has monitored white nationalists, racist skinheads and neo-Nazi groups for more than three decades.
""Attempted assassination of elected officials past and present, a synagogue being attacked and people being killed in a grocery store in Kentucky - none of these folks engaged in any kind of violence,"" he told Al Jazeera, adding: ""It has never really been this [violent] during elections.""
Jenkins, who founded the One People's Project hate watchdog in 2000, added, ""These [the far right] are the people who are supposed to be in power right now, and yet they still feel they're threatened.""
Although he expected similar far-right violence had Hillary Clinton bested Trump during the 2016 presidential elections, he says that the stakes are especially high now. ""You're talking about people who are predicting civil war if Trump is impeached … this is what they are looking for.""
Critics point to Trump's rhetoric, arguing that president's words have contributed to the spike in incitement, surge in hate crimes and mushrooming of hate groups.
In early October, members of the far-right, pro-Trump Proud Boys group attacked anti-fascist protesters outside the Metropolitan Republican Club in New York City. Gavin McInnes, the group's founder, had been invited to speak at the club, where his supporters assaulted the protesters and yelled homophobic slurs.
Last week, when Trump addressed a campaign event in Texas for Senator Ted Cruz, he deemed himself a ""nationalist"" gripped in a battle against ""power-hungry globalists"".
Condemnation followed soon after, and Trump's opponents pointed out that the term globalist is often employed in the service of far-right conspiracy theories and carries thinly-veiled anti-Semitic undertones.
With little success, Trump and his supporters have sought to distance the president's rhetoric from the violence unravelling on the ground.
After the deadly synagogue shooting in Pittsburgh, Trump took to Twitter to blame ""fake news"" for ""great anger"" in the country. His comments echoed similar ones made a few days earlier in response to the spate of attempted bombings.
Steven Rogers, a former law enforcement officer who sits on the Trump for President advisory board, defended Trump against allegations of incitement and fearmongering.
""Hate is embedded in one's heart,"" he told Al Jazeera, arguing that films, music and video games have cultivated a culture of violence.
""It is not caused by a person's political speech. The president is not responsible for the terrible acts of… deranged people.""
But the SPLC's Beirich says there is ""no question"" that Trump's rhetoric has tilled the soil for would-be attackers. ""We have been tracking domestic terrorism incidents for more than 20 years, and I don't really remember seeing something like this.""

https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/09/midterm-elections-key-issues-180928103258276.html,migrant,1800,Tue Oct 30 2018 21:20:07 GMT+0000,None,US midterm elections: What are the key issues? ,"On November 6, voters across the United States will head to the ballot box in elections slated as a test for right-wing President Donald Trump.
The midterm elections follow two years of increasing hostility in American politics, during which the Republican Party has controlled a majority in both the Senate and the House of Representatives.
Although the elections will not consider presidential candidates, they will decide on the trajectory of American politics for the next two years. This year, voters will decide on governors, representatives and senators.
Americans will cast their votes for all 435 seats in the House of Representatives, 35 of the 100 seats in the Senate and 39 state and territorial governorships.
For Democrats, the midterms are an opportunity to take back a majority in both congressional chambers in order to stymie Trump's controversial programmes.
In the House, Democrats would have to gain about two dozen seats to clinch the 218-seat majority. FiveThirtyEight, a statistics website, predicts that Democrats have an 76-percent chance of gaining a majority.
In the Senate, where Republicans currently control 51 of 100 seats, Republicans have a 66-percent chance of maintaining their majority, according to FiveThirtyEight predictions.
Voter enthusiasm is at its highest level for a midterm election in more than two decades, a September report by the Pew Research Institute found. About 61 percent of voters surveyed said they were enthusiastic about this year's elections. About 72 percent said they will factor in which party controls Congress when casting their vote.
Among the issues toping voters minds are healthcare, the economy, immigration, women's rights and Supreme Court appointments.
A major Republican victory in the midterms would likely lead to the final nail in the coffin of the Affordable Care Act (known as ""Obamacare""), the healthcare law introduced by Trump's predecessor, Barack Obama.
Although Republicans have so far failed to repeal and replace Obamacare, Congress and Trump have made changes to it.
Since then, the party has found itself on the defensive in the debate over healthcare.
According to a September Pew report, about 75 percent of voters ranked healthcare as a ""very important"". That same report found that Democrats have a wide advantage over Republicans on dealing with healthcare. Fifty-one percent of voters said that the Democratic Party could do a better job dealing with healthcare, while 35 percent said Republicans would do better.
Against that backdrop, healthcare has taken the centre stage in several key races across the US.
According to the political ad tracking firm Kantar Media/CMAG, Democrats have poured $125m on ads focused on healthcare, while Republicans have spent around $50m.
Healthcare is playing a major role in the Senate election in Texas, where a high-profile race between Republican incumbent Senator Ted Cruz and progressive Democratic challenger Beto O'Rourke is taking place.
Cruz, who played a leading role in shutting down the government in 2013 as a part of an unsuccessful drive to repeal Obamacare, has in the past vowed to repeal ""every single word"" of the Affordable Care Act.
In response, O'Rourke has pushed back, arguing that Cruz's claim to support protecting insurance-seekers with pre-existing medical conditions does not line up with his promise to abolish the Affordable Care Act.
Republicans' backing of a lawsuit crafted to invalidate the Affordable Care Act has also drawn a backlash. In Wisconsin, Democratic gubernatorial candidate Tony Evers, the state education chief, has challenged incumbent Republican Governor Scott Walker to rescind his support for the lawsuit.
Trump's nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court created a whirlwind of controversy. Kavanaugh is accused of sexually assaulting Christine Blasey Ford and other women when they were in the 1980s. Kavanaugh has denied the allegations.
Although the Republican-led Senate voted to confirm Kavanaugh, the now-Supreme Court justice has become a rallying cry for Democrats before the midterms.
The allegations against Kavanaugh came amid a swell in controversy over sexual harassment and sexual assault as the #MeToo movement continues to gain steam in the US.
It remains unclear how exactly the Kavanaugh controversy may affect the midterm elections, however. Kavanaugh's appointment moved the court further to the right, giving Trump more of a boost as he continues to hit the campaign trail for his fellow Republicans. Some analysts say, however, that the controversy over Kavanaugh and the way the allegations were handled may galvanise Democratic supporters.
One thing that is clear is that the issue of appointments is on voters' minds.
Pew, whose survey took place as the Kavanaugh controversy was under way, found that 76 percent of registered voters viewed Supreme Court appointments as a ""very important"" issue when considering how they will vote on November 6.
One of Trump's rally cries at campaign events is often the economy. He regularly boasts about the growth levels, as well as how unemployment rates are at record lows.
The unemployment rate fell to 3.7 percent last month, its lowest in nearly 50 years. But job growth also slowed, some economists attributing this to Hurricane Florence, which hit parts of the East Coast.
Although the US economy is growing, economists worry working-class families may not really see the benefits. It's only recently that wages started to slightly increase and some say it may not last. There's also debate on whether it's the policies of Trump or his predecessor, Barack Obama, or both that have contributed to economic growth.
According to the September Pew report, Republicans and Democrats are about even when voters are asked which party they think is better at dealing with the economy. About 41 percent said Democrats and 40 percent said Republicans, but as Pew noted that is a significant change from about three months ago when Republicans held a nine-point edge over the Democrats on the handling of the economy.
With Trump facing strong opposition from women's rights groups and advocates since the outset of his presidency - when millions of women took to the streets worldwide to protest his – women are expected to play a crucial role in deciding the midterms.
Most of them Democrats, record numbers of women have run and succeeded in primary elections for the US House, US Senate and gubernatorial races in 2018, according to statistics by the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University.
Since the 1980s, women voters have turned out in larger numbers than their male counterparts, but surveys suggest that, in 2018, a larger number of women have found themselves on the Democratic side of the political divide. Men, on the other hand, are divided about evenly between Democrats and Republicans.
A poll recently published by NPR and Marist found that 62 percent of women disapprove of Trump - around half of whom ""strongly disapprove"".
Women's rights advocates have long criticised Trump. During the 2016 presidential elections, a video emerged of Trump boasting that he could grope women by their ""p***y"" without consent owing to his fame and wealth.
Rights groups and other advocates also point to the administration's attack on reproductive rights. From reinstating and expanding the Global Gag Rule, which halts US funding to international organisations that offer abortion services or information on the procedure, to appointing anti-abortion rights individuals to high-level posts within the administration, advocates say Trump is waging an ""assault"" on women's health.
A Republican victory would potentially allow Trump to appoint even more conservative Supreme Court judges, casting fear over the future of Roe v Wade, the landmark 1973 decision that ruled on the constitutionality of state and federal restrictions on access to abortion.
Newly minted Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh has so far declined to comment on how he would rule if he were to consider the legality of abortion. In answering a question about Roe v Wade during his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh said the case is ""an important precedent of the Supreme Court that has been reaffirmed many times"".
Although Trump proved victorious during the November 2016 presidential elections after a heated campaign targeting immigrants, outrage earlier this year over the administration's separation of migrant children from their parents has cast a long shadow over the midterms.
The Trump administration has pushed sweeping immigration reform, taking aim at undocumented immigrants as well as proposing rule changes for those attempting to obtain green cards, welfare and food stamps, among other government benefits.
In August, the president said immigration will be a winning issue for Republicans in the upcoming midterms, accusing Democrats of advocating open borders and turning a blind eye to crimes committed by immigrants.
""I think we're going to have much more of a red wave than what you're going to see as a phony blue wave,"" Trump said last month. ""Blue wave means crime, it means open borders. Not good.""
More recently Trump has ordered troops to the US-Mexico border to intercept a caravan of migrants and asylum seekers heading there, and has floated the idea of ending birthright citizenship.
Democrats hope to rally minorities and young voters against Trump's harsh immigration policies, while Trump and the Republicans have accused the Democrats of seeking open borders and a free flow of immigrants into the country.
Several polls conducted over the summer suggest a majority of Americans believe Democrats are more capable of handling immigration-related issues. In July, a Quinnipiac report concluded that 58 percent of Americans disapprove of Trump's immigration policies, while a similar Reuters poll found that 52 percent did not support the president's immigration agenda.
Republican voters, however, continue to support the president on immigration, with more than half supporting separating children from their parents on the border.
For Democrats and Republicans alike, the midterms elections will offer a chance to resolve questions around the potential impeachment of Trump.
Talk of impeachment stems from several issues, including accusations that Trump has inappropriately benefited financially from his presidency, behaved with indecency and an investigation into alleged collusion with Russia during the 2016 elections, among others.
In late August, a poll conducted by The Washington Post and ABC found that 60 percent of American voters disapprove of Trump's performance, while a similar survey by FiveThirtyEight put the disapproval rating just under 54 percent.
According to the poll just under half (49 percent) of those surveyed believed Congress should start impeachment proceedings. About 46 percent said they don't support impeachment. Of those who support impeachment, about 70 percent identified as liberal.
Republicans and groups that support the right-wing party have seized the threat of impeachment to rally their base, urging their supporters to take to the ballot box in November to prevent the president's potential removal.
Trump's lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, has stated that the midterms will be about one issue: ""impeachment or no impeachment"".
Democratic Representative Al Green, from Texas, brought a pair of impeachment efforts to the House last winter, but both were blocked by a large margin.

Henry Diaz, a 26-year-old Honduran, was shot in the head with a rubber bullet, causing a deep head wound. He died on the way to a local hospital.
Diaz was among more than 1,000 migrants and refugees, most of them from Honduras, who attempted to force their way through the Tecun Uman crossing on Sunday. Police also used tear gas; more than 100 people were wounded.
The group at the Mexican border on Sunday are attempting to catch up to the initial wave of now more than 7,000 migrants and refugees who began their journey north more than two weeks ago. The group has been dubbed a migrant caravan.
Santo Avila, a 29-year-old labourer from Palestina, a rural community in eastern Honduras, told Al Jazeera the confrontation was a setback for the group.
""We advanced maybe 10 percent, but we have been set back 100 percent,"" said Avila, while sitting on the bridge over the Suchiate River between Guatemala and Mexico.
""If the Mexican government does not let us through then we will have to return to Honduras where we will continue to suffer from extreme poverty and be threatened by the government,"" he said. ""We want to maintain the peace and find the support of the [Mexican] government in order to find opportunity.""
The Tecun Uman border crossing, the principal crossing between Guatemala and Mexico, has been closed for more than a week. Blocked from crossing, groups of Hondurans travelling up through Guatemala gathered until they had a sizable group to attempt to enter Mexico together.
After migrants and refugees broke through a border gate and tried to force their way past Guatemalan police, officers deployed tear gas, batons and flash-bang grenades. People in the crowd responded by hurling tear gas canisters back at police, along with any items they could find, including tree branches, water bottles, and even personal backpacks.
Among those injured were children, according to local news reports. Several police officers were also wounded, the Guatemalan national police force said.
The Mexican government rejected that ""violent protests"" took place at the border, Mexican Minister of the Interior Alfonso Navarrete said on Sunday in a press conference.
Navarrete denied Diaz was killed by Mexican forces. Mexican federal police were not carrying any weapons, ""not even plastic bullets,"" he said at the press conference. But migrants and refugees as well as observers and media, including Al Jazeera, witnessed federal police firing rubber bullets.
The only way to enter Mexico is by following immigration laws, Navarrete said. He added that Mexico does not criminalise undocumented migration and mentioned that Mexico is recognised internationally for its absolute respect for migrants' human rights.
But international human rights groups disagree. Amnesty International accused the government of effectively detaining more than 1,000 migrants and refugees who requested asylum in what the government has described as a shelter.
Guatemalan and Mexican official human rights commissions have also raised concerns about governmental responses to the groups of migrants and refugees travelling through both countries.
Guatemalan human rights ombudsman Jordan Rodas lamented Diaz's death in a statement on Sunday. He called on authorities to act within a framework of respect for human rights and privileging dialogue, and on migrants to remain peaceful.
Carla Rubio was caught up in the border chaos, having crossed onto the bridge after the crowd brought down a border fence. She was happy to finally be one step closer to Mexico and frustrated at the police repression that had occurred.
""It is inhumane what the [Guatemalan police] have done,"" she told Al Jazeera.
A 38-year-old woman from Tegucigalpa, the Honduran capital, Rubio is travelling with her family, including three children. The police response was unjustified, she said.
""There was no aggression. We only wanted a dialogue,"" said Rubio.
Tensions remained high throughout the day. Various military and police forces were present throughout the border region, and a Mexican federal police helicopter circled overhead.
Mexican Marines were deployed in boats on the Suchiate River and made periodic announcements warning migrants against crossing into the country between official ports of entry, saying they should instead seek to apply for asylum.
But those within the caravan remain sceptical.
""They say they are going to give asylum,"" Rubio told Al Jazeera, but said that ""they are not providing the means, it is a lie.""
Rubio and her family are fleeing Honduras due to the threat of violence. She and her husband want to find work and provide a better future for their family.
""Our country does not have the conditions for them,"" she said of their three young children.
Most migrants and refugees fleeing north cite unemployment or violence or both as their primary reason for leaving Honduras. The country has one of the 10 highest per capita homicide rates in the world and more than two-thirds of its inhabitants live in poverty.
While some caravan participants have always planned to seek a new life in Mexico, reaching the US is the goal for most.
But there, US President Donald Trump has threatened to cut US aid to Central American governments and to shut down the southern border of the US.
Reuters, citing an unnamed source, reported on Monday that thousands of US troops may be sent to the border. The Pentagon declined Reuters' request for comment, saying planning was still under way. There were also unconfirmed reports last week that the White House was considering an executive order to block the migrants and refugees from entering the US.
Still more than 1,200km from the US border, the caravan participants are undeterred. Although they have been met with overwhelming support from many of the towns they've walked through, Mexican security have attempted to stop the group at several points along the way.
On Saturday, Mexican federal police blocked the highway and temporarily prevented the advance of the caravan through the state of Chiapas.
Mexican police cleared out after more than two hours, after the crowd agreed to continue dialogue with the Mexican government about President Enrique Pena Nieto's offer of temporary jobs and access to services for migrants and refugees should they choose to remain in the states of Chiapas and Oaxaca, in southern Mexico.
The offer was only made to the large initial group already travelling up through Mexico, the proposal Pena Nieto announced Friday was not directed at any new groups seeking to enter the country.
Meanwhile, hundreds of people set out Sunday from both Olancho, in eastern Honduras, and San Salvador, the capital of El Salvador.
Following the police crackdowns at the border Sunday, the group set up sleeping areas on the Guatemalan side of the border. Overnight, Guatemalan authorities reinforced and fortified a border fence with barbed wire.
On Monday, a large group set out to cross the Suchiate River into Mexico. The situation at the border is tense, but they still hope to make it into Mexico and catch up to the thousands now in the state of Oaxaca.

Werner Guzman and Paulo Wilmer Martinez bubbled with energy, setting out hours before dawn on Saturday near the front of the group making its way from Central America to the US.
""I am from Guatemala. He is from El Salvador,"" Guzman told Al Jazeera while walking in the moonlight, after setting out shortly after 3am (08:00 GMT) from Arriaga, a town in the southern Mexican state of Chiapas.
A 23-year-old mechanic from the northern Guatemalan department of San Marcos, Guzman does not want to live in the US permanently. He wants to send money home to his family and save some up to head back home.
""It is my dream to make it to the US to work,"" Guzman told Al Jazeera.
Thousands of migrants and refugees are making their way north through Mexico. More than 1,000 people initially set out from Honduras more than two weeks ago, and the number has now grown to well over 7,000, with some estimates surpassing 10,000.
The overwhelming majority of the migrants and refugees travelling in what was dubbed a migrant caravan are from Honduras, but people from other Latin American countries, especially other Central Americans, have been joining.
There is now a smattering of Salvadorans, Guatemalans, Nicaraguans and Mexicans among the crowd on the road. Guzman told Al Jazeera he has also met a few people from other Central and South American countries.
Most of the migrants and refugees are fleeing violence and unemployment. The per capita homicide rates in Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala are among the highest in the world outside of active war zones. More than half of the population in all three countries lives in poverty.
US President Donald Trump has been urging the Central Americans to turn around and head home and has threatened to cut US aid to their governments. He has also promised to send active-duty troops to the border, and US media outlets reported an executive order to prevent the group from entering and seeking asylum is being considered.
Despite Trump's threats and the arduous journey north, walking dozens of kilometres a day and often sleeping out in the open in town plazas, there are bursts of collective joy and laughter along the way every day.
""Slow down. Speed bump!"" someone joked as the group walked out of Arriaga. Minutes later, a whole little section of the crowd erupted in laughter when someone passed gas loudly, prompting jokes about duck and frog noises.
Another roughly eight kilometres into the day's 45km walk, the crowd halted. Mexican federal police in riot gear were blocking the highway up ahead, declaring they would not let the group pass.
More than two hours of dialogue ensued, with human rights workers serving as intermediaries between police and the migrants and refugees. Police said the Mexican government had already offered the group what they wanted, referring to a plan announced on Friday to offer the Central Americans refuge, temporary jobs, schooling for children and medical attention if they settled in southern Mexico.
At roughly 8am (13:00 GMT), police received orders to clear out, allowing the caravan to continue with the understanding that dialogue with the government would continue in the coming days after they crossed the state line from Chiapas into Oaxaca.
Guzman and many others hope to be able to continue north through Mexico and make it into the US to find work to support their families.
He wants to work for four years to send money home to his partner and their young son and to save up enough to build a small house for the family upon returning to his community in the municipality of El Tumbador, just 37km by road to the Ciudad Hidalgo border crossing into Mexico.
""I came now so that immigration [agents] would not get me and because I do not have the money. A smuggler from Guatemala to the US costs between [$7,700 and 9,000],"" he said.
Guzman travelled alone and rafted across the Suchiate River into Mexico, joining the thousands of other migrants and refugees Thursday. That is when he met Martinez.
Martinez, 26, is from Zacatecoluca, a town 60km southwest of San Salvador, the capital of El Salvador. Like Guzman, he hopes to make it to the US and work to send home to his family. He is father to a two-and-a-half-year-old daughter.
""I joined on Monday, just [six] days ago. I came alone,"" Martinez told Al Jazeera while trekking along the highway in an ad hoc affinity group with Guzman and two young Honduran men, also in their 20s.
Martinez has been working at a local bakery in Zacatecoluca but has wanted to flee El Salvador for a while due to gang violence.
""El Salvador is very dangerous. If anyone sees an opportunity to get out, they take it,"" he said.
Aside from Martinez, there are currently a few other Salvadorans travelling north into Mexico with the massive crowd of mostly Hondurans. But many more Salvadorans may soon be joining them.
Approximately 200 migrants and refugees set out Sunday morning from San Salvador. They hope to travel north through Guatemala and up into Mexico and beyond. Another Salvadoran caravan, likely a larger group, plans to leave Wednesday from San Salvador.
In a statement on Friday, Salvadoran President Salvador Sanchez Ceren urged the country's population not to engage in irregular migration and stated that the government would enforce its immigration regulations, particularly to ensure any children leaving the country can only do so with the required documentation.
Paulo Wilmer Martinez, caravan participant
At the same time, the government ""is respectful of the freedom of transit and movement, as well as the rights of migrants, and so we also respect the freedom to express solidarity with people who make that decision"", according to the statement.
The Salvadoran groups are likely to face major obstacles along the route north through Guatemala and Mexico. Hundreds of migrants and refugees gathered on Sunday morning on the Guatemalan side of the Ciudad Hidalgo border crossing, but security forces, including Mexican federal police, blocked their entrance to Mexico.
As groups continue to attempt to cross into Mexico and catch up with the thousands of people now in the Mexican state of Oaxaca, Martinez and Guzman push on with the group. They both hope to make it to the US but know the situation is uncertain.
""You never know whether it will be possible to stay or if you will be kicked out. You have to be prepared for anything, but the goal is to work,"" said Martinez.

The tiny Gulf nation will be the first from the Arab world to host the World Cup, breaking with tradition with a winter kick-off as it looks to avoid the scorching summer heat.
FIFA President Gianni Infantino hailed Qatar's progress on infrastructure during a visit to its capital, Doha, on Tuesday, after inspecting the eight stadiums and several training sites that will be used for the month-long tournament.
""You can see the progress which is being made here four years before kick-off,"" Infantino said after a tour of the Al Wakrah stadium, a 40,000 capacity venue that will host matches up to the quarter-finals stage.
""The Russian World Cup was the best ever, and the World Cup in 2022 has to be even better,"" he said.
""I think this World Cup is extremely important, not only for Qatar but for the whole region - a region that has a passion for football and is investing a lot in the game.""
Qatar beat bid rivals Australia, Japan, South Korea and the United States in 2010 to claim the hosting rights.
As it looks to open its doors to football fans and teams from around the world for its biggest sporting event since the 2006 Asian Games, the Gulf state has come under increasing scrutiny over its treatment of migrant workers.
To date, there have been three work-related fatalities and nine non-work related deaths of workers engaged in the construction of Qatar's World Cup stadiums, according to the tournament organisers.
But the United Nations' International Labour Organization (ILO) dismissed all complaints lodged against Qatar following a new draft bill, introducing minimum wage and legal protection for the foreign workforce, approved by the government last year.
At least 26,000 people are directly involved in the construction of the proposed stadiums.
Contractors involved in the World Cup projects have agreed to reimburse more than $14.4m to the thousands of workers who had paid recruitment fees before moving to Qatar.
Seven new state-of-the-art stadiums with advanced open-air cooling technology are being built from scratch for the 2022 event.
The eighth one, Khalifa International Stadium located next to the iconic Torch Tower, was inaugurated in May last year, after undergoing renovations and upgrades.
Meanwhile, the Supreme Committee for Delivery and Legacy (SC), which is overseeing the organisation of the 2022 World Cup, said earlier this year the Al Wakrah Stadium and Al Bayt in Al Khor will be ready by December.
""All the stadiums will be completed two years before the tournament starts,"" Yasser Al Mulla, the SC's Landscape & Sport Turf Management senior manager, said in January.
Here is a look at the progress of the stadiums.
The Khalifa International stadium, which was built in 1976 in Doha, is the first tournament-ready venue.
This 40,000-capacity arena has already hosted the Gulf Cup, Asian Games and the AFC Asian Cup.
Located in the southern city of Al Wakrah, this 40,000-seat stadium is ""almost complete"", according to the SC, and its retractable roof is now being installed.
The Lusail Stadium, located in Lusail city, about 23km north of Doha, will host the opening ceremony and the final of the World Cup.
According to the SC, the concrete superstructure of the stadium and the seating terraces are at an advanced stage.
The Al Bayt Stadium, located in Al Khor city, has a capacity of 60,000. Its exterior, which resembles tents used in Qatar's deserts, is half complete.
Education City stadium, on the outskirts of Doha, is right in the middle of Qatar's leading universities.
After hosting matches up to the quarter-finals stage, the arena will be reduced in half and 20,000 seats will be donated to build stadiums in developing countries.
The Al Rayyan Stadium in Qatar's second-most populous city is being built on the site of the old Ahmed Bin Ali Stadium, previous home of Qatar's Al Rayyan Sports Club. It will have a capacity of 40,000 seats.
This 40,000 seat stadium is located 12km south of Doha's skyline and seafront. It is an architectural depiction of the gahfiya, a traditional cap worn by Arab men.
The venue's unique design won the Architectural Review Future Projects Award in May.
To be built on the shores of the Gulf, the Ras Aboud stadium will overlook the Doha skyline in the backdrop.
This 40,000 seat venue will be completely dismantled and re-purposed for other sporting and non-sporting projects after the tournament. Its foundations are currently being laid.

Mexican federal police in riot gear blocked the highway about 10km from Arriaga, Chiapas state, in the early hours of Saturday.
More than 7,000 people, most of them Hondurans, had set out shortly after 3am local time (08:00 GMT) from Arriaga, aiming to walk 43km and reach Oaxaca state.
As news of the roadblock spread, human rights staff travelling alongside the migrants and refugees moved ahead to hold talks with the police.
Federal police agents told the human rights workers that had received orders to prevent the group from proceeding. The government has already offered to give the migrants what they wanted, the commanding offer said.
Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto on Friday announced an initiative for the migrants and refugees, offering to provide temporary jobs, medical attention and schooling for children.
But in an assembly, the group decided to push ahead with its plan to reach Oaxaca and then request documentation in the capital, Mexico City.
When they arrived at the roadblock, they engaged in a peaceful sit-in on the highway, refusing to leave until they were permitted to advance.
At about 8am local time (13:00 GMT), police received orders to clear the road, allowing the migrants and refugees to continue their journey, with more than 30km left to go before reaching San Pedro Tapanatepec, Oaxaca. Dialogue between the government and the group of migrants and refugees is expected to continue.
""We are not harming anyone,"" Billy Noe Martinez told Al Jazeera.
The 34-year-old left his home in Tegucigalpa, the capital of Honduras, and travelled into Guatemala and then Mexico with the initial wave of migrants and refugees, dubbed a migrant caravan.
""We want a better future for our children,"" added Martinez.
The current exodus from Honduras began two weeks ago, when more than 1,000 people set out for the United States, seeking safety in numbers. By the time the group crossed into Mexico, they numbered more than 5,000 and the crowd continues to grow as smaller groups that departed later join them.
Most migrants and refugees are fleeing violence and unemployment in Honduras, a country with one of the highest per capita homicide rates in the world. More than two-thirds of Hondurans live in poverty, according to the World Bank.
For many of those fleeing Honduras, the harsh conditions along the route north pale in comparison to conditions at home. Most caravan participants have told Al Jazeera they are seeking better lives for themselves but especially their children, either by taking them to safety or by seeking work to be able to support their families back home.
Angelo Coto is one of them.
The 36-year-old farmer from El Progreso, in northwestern Honduras, used to grow corn, beans, watermelon and cucumbers. But he does not own any land and work is too unreliable to support his two sons, aged three and 10.
""Some days there is work, some days there is not,"" he told Al Jazeera, adding that his hope is to find a job in order to provide for his young family - whether that is in the US or in Mexico.
Coto said he knows the Mexican government is pressuring the migrants and refugees to stay in the country, but he hopes the caravan will continue its journey towards the US.
""If it keeps going, I'll go. If not, I'll stay,"" he said.

The caravan is still more than 1,500km from the US border, but a US official who spoke anonymously to Reuters said the military was examining the request, which could require deploying between 800 and 1,000 active-duty troops to the border to assist with logistics and infrastructure.
Thousands of US-bound Central American men, women and children seeking to escape violence, poverty and government corruption in their home countries continued their journey on Thursday. Under a full moon during pre-dawn hours, they walked from Mapastepec, close to the Guatemala border in southern Mexico. A town official said there had been 5,300 migrants in Mapastepec on Wednesday night.
The US official speaking to Reuters, said that any US troops deployed to the border would not be involved in ""law enforcement"" activities, owing to its prohibition by a federal law dating to the 1870s.
That law restricts the use of the army and other main branches of the military for civilian law enforcement on US soil unless specifically authorised by Congress. But the military can provide support services to law enforcement and has done so on occasion since the 1980s.
AFP news agency, citing an unnamed US official, reported that the Pentagon is expected to deploy ""several hundred"" troops to the border. The official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, told the news agency that the troops would be used mainly to provide logistical support including tents, vehicles and equipment.
Trump has taken a hard line towards immigration since becoming president last year. On Monday, Trump said he had alerted the Border Patrol and the US military that the migrant caravan was a national emergency.
The initial wave of migrants and refugees, who left Honduras less than two weeks ago, has been followed by other groups, who are now making their way through Guatemala.
White House officials did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Trump's comments regarding a military deployment and a national emergency. The president has also threatened to cut US aid to the Central American countries if the migrants and refugees are not stopped.
Trump has sought to make the caravan and immigration major issues ahead of the November 6 midterm election, in which his Republican party is trying to maintain control of the House of Representatives and the Senate.
It is not new territory for Trump, who pledged during the 2016 presidential race to build a wall along the southern US border with Mexico. However, funding for his signature campaign promise has been slow to materialise.
In April, frustrated by lack of progress on the wall, Trump ordered the National Guard to help secure the border in four southwestern states. There are currently 2,100 National Guard troops along the borders of Texas, New Mexico, Arizona and California.
Also in April, Trump raised the prospect of sending active-duty military forces to the border to block immigrants, raising questions in Congress and among legal experts about troop deployments on US soil.
The president has been criticised by immigrant advocates and rights groups over his ""zero tolerance"" policy at the border. Earlier this year, Trump was forced to abandon his administration's controversial practice of separating families at the border after public outcry.
Caravans coming from Central America have made their way to the US border for years without much fanfare. Migrants and refugees often leave in groups for safety purposes. This month's caravan is unusual for its large size, however, and those travelling north seem to be so far undeterred by the president's threats.
In April, a caravan that had about 1,500 people at its peak also caught the ire of Trump. Many of its participants attempted to stay in Mexico and only a few hundred people continued to the US border, seeking asylum at an official port of entry, rights groups said.
According to the New York Times, about 400 were referred to the US for ""credible fear"" interviews. Many who passed that step are still awaiting further immigration hearings.
Rights groups have slammed the president's reaction to the latest caravan as a ""scare"" tactic, especially before the midterm elections.
Earlier this week, Amnesty International said in a statement on Twitter that ""the caravan is not a 'National Emergy' or a security threat.""
It added, ""Many of these individuals are fleeing violence in their home country with the intention of seeking asylum. These are people. They have human rights. You cannot scare us away from the truth.""
Rights groups have also said the government responses to and threats made against the caravan may violate international law.

In a news briefing with reporters on Tuesday, Trump administration officials pointed to the increase in migrant families as evidence of a ""border crisis"" because those groups are more difficult for immigration enforcement officials to detain and deport because of protections granted by US law to migrant children. Rights groups, however, dispute Trump's claim, saying that while there was an increase in apprehensions in 2018, overall, irregular immigration has been at a historic low over the last few years.
The Trump administration expressed alarm at the change in the makeup of migrants attempting to cross into the United States from mostly single adults to children and families travelling together.
About 40 percent of those apprehended in the fiscal years 2017 and 2018 were unaccompanied children or families with children, compared with 10 percent in 2012, according to the Migration Policy Institute, a non-partisan think-tank.
According to numbers released on Tuesday, US border officials arrested nearly 397,000 people in total at the southern border in the 2018 fiscal year that ended September 30, an increase over the 304,000 apprehended in 2017 but largely in line with arrest trends of migrants at the US southern border over the past decade.
Border arrests dropped in the months after Trump took office in January 2017 but have rebounded over the past year.
Trump has vowed to begin cutting millions of dollars in aid to Central America over a caravan of thousands of mostly Honduran migrants and refugees fleeing violence and poverty at home.
Earlier this year, the Trump administration tried to deter families from travelling to the border by instituting a ""zero tolerance"" policy, which included separating thousands of children from their parents as the adults were prosecuted.
About 2,500 children and parents were separated before Trump abandoned the practice in June after a public outcry. A federal judge ordered the families reunited, a process that is still incomplete, with hundreds of children still separated from their families.
Earlier this month, the Washington Post reported that the White House was considering plans that may result in family separations. Citing officials briefed on the issues, the Post said the Trump administration was looking at potentially asking detained asylum seekers to choose between staying in detention with their children for an indefinite period of time or allowing their children to be sent to government shelters where family members could seek custody.
Hogan Gifly, White House deputy press secretary, told the newspaper in a statement at the time that ""career law enforcement professionals in the US government are working to analyse and evaluate options that would protect the American people, prevent the horrific actions of child smuggling, and stop drug cartels from pouring into our communities.""
In Texas's Rio Grande Valley (RGV), where more migrants are arrested crossing between official ports of entry than in any other section of the 2,000-mile-long (3,200-km) border with Mexico, apprehensions continued to rise in October, said the Border Patrol sector's Chief Patrol Agent Manuel Padilla.
There were over 12,700 arrests in the RGV during the first three weeks of October, marking a 112 percent increase over the same period in 2017, Padilla said in a phone interview.
Sixty-four percent of those detentions were of family members or unaccompanied children from countries other than Mexico, up from a rate of 51 percent in all of the fiscal year 2018, Padilla said.
More than 5,400 family units were detained in the first half of October, up 300 percent from the same period in 2017.
""Right now we're at maximum capacity when it comes to detention, and so is ICE [US Immigration and Customs Enforcement]. Our detention capacity is just breaking at the seams,"" said Padilla, predicting border-wide family apprehensions would rise again in October. ""This is not sustainable.""

A sign is taped to the basket, letting passing migrants and refugees, who are part of a caravan headed towards the US, know they are welcome to take a pair. Bags of water and bread sit on a table above the shoes, and a note encouraging people to donate sweaters is nearby.
An initial wave of Honduran migrants and refugees came through here on October 15, and most of them are now travelling up through southern Mexico. But hundreds of Hondurans have been making their way through Esquipulas every day since.
""We do what we can,"" Alvarado tells Al Jazeera of the ad hoc support centre in front of her business, along one of the main streets of Esquipulas.
Originally from El Salvador, Alvarado makes and sells simple meals, including pupusas, the most iconic Salvadoran food. But she also runs a small migrant support group called Corazones Bondadosos, which translates as Generous Hearts.
In the eatery's kitchen, Reina Madrid is busy making corn dough and preparing meals for customers. Al Jazeera first interviewed the mother-of-four over the weekend, when she had just arrived after an arduous journey across the border, where police were blocking hundreds of Hondurans from leaving.
Madrid, a cook who left Honduras due to unemployment, is now cheerfully working away in the kitchen. She slept, ate, and has clean and dry clothes. She also has some temporary work for now, helping out Alvarado.
""It's all thanks to her,"" Madrid tells Al Jazeera, referring to the job that will help her send money to her children for food, bills, and school supplies.
Madrid is one of thousands of Hondurans who left their country en masse over the past 10 days, fleeing violence and unemployment. Dubbed a migrant caravan, there are now groups ranging between a few people and several thousand at different points in Guatemala and Mexico.
US President Donald Trump has been tweeting against the exodus since it began, threatening to cut aid to Central American governments, deride regional government responses, shut down the border, and call in the military to stop the caravan's advance.
The Mexican, Guatemalan and Honduran government have also responded to the mass exodus with similar rhetoric, as well as concrete measures, including beefing up the presence of security forces at their borders.
Hundreds of Hondurans are still managing to get out, though, often hiking around the border and police checkpoints. They walk into Esquipulas, and just a block away from Alvarado's corner eatery, they go to the local Casa del Migrante Jose shelter.
The shelter, which is affiliated with the Catholic Church, is entirely volunteer-run.
According to volunteer Griselda Garcia the shelter celebrated its one-year anniversary last month, but a group of volunteers have been supporting migrants and refugees for much longer.
They started organising to provide relief and support for the wave of African migrants and refugees heading north through Central America over the past few years, she says, taking a brief break from her cooking duties.
""At first we started just giving coffee and bread. The truth is we saw people were in need, and when one sees kids, one is even more moved,"" Garcia tells Al Jazeera.
The shelter provides food for migrants and refugees, and a place to stay when possible. But lately there have been so many people they have had to borrow two large halls belonging to the Catholic Church to provide somewhere for everyone to sleep.
""Every day, 400 or 500 people arrive to us here,"" Garcia says, referring to the current exodus from Honduras.
""There are many families, many single mothers, and many youth passing through,"" she says.
The situation in shelters all around Guatemala is similar to that of Esquipulas, where Guatemalans are providing a place to rest, as well as rides, food, water and clothing to help out their Honduran neighbours.
Back in Esquipulas, a young man interrupts Garcia to ask if there are plastic bags left over from the water that can be used as rubbish bags for people wanting to help clean up. They're out of the bags, it turns out, but will improvise.
Garcia and the other volunteers come in shifts and help out whenever possible, but they also all have jobs and families, she says. Regardless, they're committed to providing food, shelter and support to the waves of Honduran migrants and refugees that continue to cross the border into Guatemala on a daily basis.
""We will continue as long as we can,"" says Garcia.

""China embarked on an energy transformation in terms of cutting coal and developing renewables, but we are now facing difficulties on both fronts,"" Li Shuo, senior climate adviser with Greenpeace, told the Reuters news agency.
Though some studies have suggested China's total climate-warming carbon dioxide emissions peaked at 9.53 gigatonnes in 2013, well ahead of its official target of ""around 2030"", the environmental group said they could reach a new high this year or next.
Coal production has risen 5.1 percent in the first three-quarters of this year to 2.59 billion tonnes.
When US President Donald Trump said he was pulling the United States out of the Paris climate accord last year, China reaffirmed its commitments to tackle its use of coal, by far its biggest source of carbon emissions.
The country has made progress in cutting the share of coal in total energy use, with the figure expected to drop to 58 percent by 2020, down more than 10 percentage points in a decade.
It has also met a 2020 target to reduce the amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) it emits per unit of growth. But the absolute volumes of both coal and CO2 remain by far the world's highest, and are still set to rise.
Big coal-producing regions such as Inner Mongolia and Shanxi have been under pressure to cap capacity, with the state promising to shut 500 million tonnes of annual production between 2016 and 2020, and banning the import and use of lower-quality coal.
But despite closing uneconomical pits, official annual production capability was 3.49 billion tonnes at the end of June, up from 3.41 billion tonnes a year earlier, the National Energy Administration (NEA) said this month. Another 976 million tonnes were under construction.
Beijing's ""decarbonisation"" plans have been hit by grid bottlenecks and subsidy backlogs that have hindered efforts to maximise solar and wind generation.
Solar capacity grew by a record 53 gigawatts (GW) in 2017, but additions are capped at 30GW this year.
They have also been hurt by a slowdown in the construction of nuclear reactors, one of the few alternative power sources able to take on the ""baseload"" generation role currently played by traditional coal-fired plants.
No new commercial reactors have been approved in nearly three years and local authorities have had little choice but to turn to coal to provide the baseload.
China's mainly coal-fired thermal power capacity rose 58GW from the end of 2016 to the end of August this year, more than half of all new domestic capacity over the period and almost enough to power Australia, NEA data showed.
""With renewables ramping up so quickly, it has given the illusion of decarbonisation, but China is falling into the same trap that Germany has fallen into - deploying lots of renewables that have to be backed up with lots of coal-fired power plants,"" said Li Ning, nuclear scientist and dean of the College of Energy at Xiamen University.
China pledged to launch another six to eight reactor projects this year, but Li said it was unlikely it would get around to making the required approvals until next year.
""If nuclear can't keep up, then it is coal,"" he said.

Waiting inside a migrant shelter in southern Guatemala, along with her daughter and niece, she hopes to continue her journey north and into Mexico.
Vasquez is from Tegucigalpa, the Honduran capital, where along with her 17-year-old daughter run a small street-side food stall.
But things took a turn for the worse when local gangs and criminal groups began extorting them for money and threatened their lives.
""They do not forgive. They do not care what kind of business it is. Money is what interests them,"" Vasquez told Al Jazeera on Saturday.
""They threatened her (daughter) and said if she did not pay they would kill her.""
Worried for her daughter's safety, Vasquez decided to flee Honduras with her and her niece after seeing the news about the caravan of thousands of migrants and refugees heading north.
The route though can be dangerous, especially for women, so Vasquez is relieved to be with others. After crossing the border into Guatemala on Friday in a group of 17 people, including children, she joined many others 10km up the road, at the Casa del Migrante Jose shelter in Esquipulas.
""We came with company. It gives us a bit more strength and security,"" said Vasquez.
More than 1,000 migrants and refugees set off on foot and on buses from northwestern Honduras on October 13, with numbers quickly rising to include several thousand more.
Thousands of Hondurans have already made it across Guatemala's northern border into Mexico, and groups of varying sizes are following behind throughout Guatemala.
Hundreds of others continue to flee every day in the hope of reaching Mexico despite the fortified borders, blockades, police checkpoints and fences they face along the way.
Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump continues to demand governments in the region halt the exodus and take people back to Honduras, threatening to cut off aid to the governments of Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador.
In a tweet last week, he also threatened to call in the army and shut the southern border of the United States.
Women and girls make up nearly half of the first wave of the northbound exodus, according to statistics released on Saturday by officials from a shelter in southern Mexico.
Of the 5,109 people accounted for, 1,565 are women and 952 are girls.
Honduran women such Vasquez, her daughter and her niece say they find safety in numbers. The route into and through Mexico can be dangerous for undocumented Central Americans.
Tens of thousands of migrants and refugees have gone missing along the way over the years, according to estimates by migrant rights groups, and many women and girls have been sexually assaulted.
Reina Madrid, a 33-year-old mother of four, crossed over into Guatemala the same day as Vasquez, but with a few hundred other people. Violence against women is a risk along the route through Mexico, but it is also a reality at home, she told Al Jazeera.
For years, Honduras has had one of the highest per capita homicide rates in the world. More men than women are murdered, but the lack of justice plagues both.
In roughly 90 percent of all homicide cases in Honduras, no one is arrested or prosecuted.
The few successful investigations into killings of women are often homicides committed by husbands, boyfriends and ex-partners, a majority trend in much of the world. But the homicides that remain in impunity can be brutal.
The word ""encostalado"", which roughly translates as ""in a sack"", has become part of the Honduran national vocabulary.
It refers to dismembered corpses found stuffed in large sacks, often at the side of roads and highways. Both men and women are sometimes killed in this manner.
""A woman's life is worth nothing [in Honduras]. They are found in sacks,"" said Madrid. ""Nothing is done.""
Madrid is staying in Esquipulas, for now, to look for work, while Vasquez hopes to do the same in Mexico.
Although many migrants and refugees are hoping to push further north into the US, an increasing number of them now have plans to settle at different points along the way.
On Sunday, Vasquez, her daughter and her niece finally set out from the Esquipulas shelter, walking north with a large group.
More migrants and refugees crossing the border from Honduras into Guatemala have already taken their place at the shelter.

She left them with her sister on Thursday afternoon to join a caravan of Honduran migrants and refugees in order to seek work.
""They were all crying. It was hard,"" she tells Al Jazeera following a harrowing journey to Esquipulas, a city in southern Guatemala just over the border from Honduras.
Madrid and her four children, ages eight through 17, are from Villanueva, a city plagued by violence in northwestern Honduras. Her daughter and three sons are all in school, but they collect and sell firewood to help make ends meet.
For years, Madrid had a job as a cook at a restaurant in Villanueva. She smiles as she explains all the different kinds of typical Honduran dishes she can make.
""I love cooking,"" she says. But she has not been able to find steady work all year.
Last year, Madrid's mother became ill and it was no longer possible to both work full-time in the restaurant and take care of her mother, who died in January.
Facing electrical bills and school expenses, Madrid decided to join a large group of Hondurans leaving from the San Pedro Sula bus terminal.
She is one of thousands of Honduran migrants and refugees fleeing the Central American nation. An initial caravan left the country one week ago, crossed into Guatemala on Monday, and has since dispersed into waves, as thousands more travel north to join them.
Thousands of Hondurans made it to the Mexican border on Friday. Some have been swimming and rafting across into Mexico. Most were stopped before entering and have been taken to shelters while they await processing one group at a time, which may take days.
Mexico, Guatemala and Honduras have been fortifying their borders all week, sending reinforcements to beef up the presence of security forces. Mexico erected fencing at the Tecun Uman border crossing with Guatemala. Honduran police and riot police have been stopping people from leaving. Guatemalan police have set up checkpoints to stop people from advancing.
The additional security measures come as US President Donald Trump continues to ramp up pressure on governments in the region to halt the caravan before it hits the southern US border, which Trump has threatened to shut down. He has also threatened to cut aid to Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador.
Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez and other high-level Honduran officials met on Saturday with their Guatemalan counterparts, including President Jimmy Morales, to address the caravan and coordinate a response. They also reached out to Mexico, they said on Saturday, claiming the caravan was politically motivated. At an air force base in Guatemala, the two presidents presented their ""Safe Return"" plan to provide transportation home for caravan participants who wish to return.
The Honduran government announced on Saturday that it was shutting down its immigration checkpoint at the Agua Caliente border crossing until further notice, adding that Guatemala's was already closed ""due to the crisis unleashed by sectors outside of national interests"", according to a National Immigration Institute statement.
People want to flee Honduras and not go back, says Madrid. She admits she considered the possibility of going back home when she arrived tired and hungry in Esquipulas, with wet clothes and cheap pink sneakers. A call with her son lifted her spirits, she says.
Madrid is part of one of several waves of hundreds of people following behind the initial caravan. When she left earlier, the bus terminal was packed with hundreds of people from different parts of Honduras setting out to flee the country for a variety of reasons, but mainly unemployment and violence.
Madrid and a crowd set out on foot from the terminal at 11pm. Between walking and a free bus ride offered along the way, Madrid arrived at the Agua Caliente border crossing with Guatemala eight hours later.
Honduran police were blocking the highway, preventing people from leaving the country, she says. Those who had lucked into bus rides right from San Pedro Sula had been there all night, and Madrid and others streamed in throughout the morning.
Madrid had heard that police told the early arrivals they would be allowed to cross at 8am, but the hours passed and national police officers and members of the Cobra police special forces continued to block the route. Most people had not slept all night or eaten, and many became restless and impatient.
""We broke through the border,"" Madrid says.
Police used batons and rocks were thrown back and forth, says Madrid. Four police officers and five migrants and refugees were wounded and treated by paramedics, according to Honduran authorities.
Madrid and others say they used tear gas, but according to officials, it was a different aerosol chemical agent. Either way, it stings a lot, Madrid says.
The crowd made it through and lined up to present their documentation to Guatemalan immigration agents for processing at the country's border checkpoint, a few kilometres past the Honduran one.
It was after dark by the time everyone made it into Guatemala, and people trickled into Esquipulas all evening, making their way to the local Casa del Migrante Jose shelter. The shelter is affiliated with the Catholic Church, but is run by volunteers of various religious denominations.
The Honduran migrants and refugees arriving at the shelter Friday night joined others from all around the country who had crossed over the previous two days.
Aside from the large groups of hundreds of Hondurans fleeing together, small groups, families and individuals have been making their way across on their own. Unable to get past the Honduran police blocking the way out of the country, dozens of small groups of people have taken to hiking around checkpoints, police lines, and the border.
Several refugees at the Esquipulas shelter told Al Jazeera they saw adults and children fall and injure themselves while trekking around checkpoints. Groups lost track of each other, and not everyone made it to Esquipulas.
At the shelter, Honduran migrants and refugees who have been there since Thursday told Al Jazeera that small groups have set out towards Guatemala City but many have not made it far. Whether people are travelling on foot or by bus, Guatemalan police have stopped many from proceeding.
They are transported back down to the Honduran border crossing, multiple refugees, as well as local Esquipulas residents and taxi drivers confirmed to Al Jazeera.
""They're being stopped,"" says Selvin Santos, who arrived in Esquipulas earlier this week from Choluteca in southern Honduras.
Santos could have attempted to leave on Friday, but he does not know the way and thinks there is more safety in numbers, he tells Al Jazeera at the Esquipulas shelter, where volunteers were busy all day preparing food and cleaning the space.
Many in the caravan prefer to wait until their numbers grow larger, but approximately 70 Hondurans decided to set out on foot from Esquipulas on Saturday and attempt to make it further along the road towards Guatemala City.

The group only made it a kilometre or so out of the city before Guatemala police special forces stopped them from proceeding. They were told to stay put on the side of the highway until police obtained further instructions on whether or not to allow them to continue.
More special forces agents gradually began arriving, however, and a police bus showed up. The group of Hondurans waited another 15 minutes or so before deciding they did not want to risk being held and transported back to the Agua Caliente border. They walked back to the shelter in Esquipulas.

It is not by choice that so many Hondurans are abandoning their country, Santos says.
""It is need. There are no job opportunities,"" he tells Al Jazeera, adding that in Honduras, ""we face hunger. There is nothing.""
Santos and other Hondurans stuck for now in Esquipulas feel alone, he says. There are few journalists and no human rights personnel visiting or accompanying them at this point. Santos and others tell Al Jazeera they know the Mexican border is now the focus, but they desperately want a media and human rights presence down by Guatemala's southern border.
Hundreds of Hondurans continue to seek a path forward to make it to Mexico or all the way into the US, but Madrid is planning to stay in Esquipulas to seek work. Several others plan to do the same in Guatemala City instead of forging on.
Two buses were set to leave Madrid's hometown of Villanueva for the border Saturday morning, and police at the border told her they were also expecting two buses from Olancho, in eastern Honduras.
While she was talking to a Honduran police officer at the border, Madrid says, she was next to a truck filled with riot gear.
""All of Honduras wants to come here,"" Madrid says.
An old meme has been circulating in light of the current situation in Honduras: ""May the last one to leave turn off the light.""

When he saw a Honduran caravan of migrants and refugees was leaving his home city of San Pedro Sula last weekend, he decided to join the group with the clothes on his back and little else.
""It was a mass joining of many people who said, 'I can join, too. I, too, am in the same circumstances. I, too, need a way out for my life.' I am one of them,"" said Vigil.
Vigil is part of a caravan of thousands of people who fled Honduras over the past week. Initially together in one large group, the caravan is now heading towards the US in waves by foot, buses and cars.
Some groups have already crossed into Mexico, others are still heading north through Guatemala, and hundreds more people are attempting to leave Honduras. Under pressure from US President Donald Trump, all three countries are beefing up security and restrictions at their southern borders.
When Vigil arrived from Honduras at the first border along the way with more than two thousand people on Monday, Guatemalan police blocked their way for two hours. Mexico sent additional forces to its southern border with Guatemala earlier this week and began erecting fences at the Tecun Uman crossing on Friday.
But caravan participants continue undeterred. Vigil left Honduras in search of employment, but Hondurans are fleeing for a myriad of reasons, including violence, he told Al Jazeera.
""People can't file reports with authorities because a lot of the time, authorities and the government itself are mixed up in a lot of things,"" Vigil said.
""The situation has gone downhill a lot since November of last year,"" he adds, referring to the general elections that resulted in Honduran president Juan Orlando Hernandez's contested reelection amid widespread allegations of election fraud. ""The oligarchy and the US got together and supported [Hernandez].""
From the outset, Vigil knew the caravan would face obstacles, but said Hondurans feel they have no other choice.
Honduran police have blocked highways at border crossings, preventing hundreds of people from fleeing. Others have resorted to crossing rivers to enter Guatemala, El Salvador and Mexico to continue north.
Mexican authorities ramped up security forces at the country's southern border on Friday, shortly before a massive group prepared to attempt to enter the country.
The move came as US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo met Mexican officials to discuss the situation.
During a joint press conference with his US counterpart, Mexican Foreign Minister Luis Videgaray said his government would process requests for humanitarian visas and asylum in Mexico on an individual basis. On Thursday, the Mexican government requested United Nations assistance in processing caravan participants.
Pompeo urged Mexican officials to stop the caravan on Friday. ""Mexico defines Mexican immigration policy,"" Videgaray said, adding that his government's priority was to ensure the safety of caravan participants.
Separately, Trump thanked Mexico for its efforts, but reiterated that those travelling in the caravan would not be allowed in the United States, and if Mexico did not stop them, he would deploy the US military to the southern border.
Earlier this week, US Vice President Mike Pence called Central American leaders to express concern over the caravan, and Trump threatened to cut US aid to the Central American countries and close the US southern border if the migrants are not stopped.
Mexico and Guatemala are also taking action against the activists that have supported the caravan.
At a rally Thursday in southern Mexico in support of the caravan, Mexican activist Irineo Mujica was arrested. As the director of the Pueblo Sin Fronteras migrant rights organisation, Mujica was actively involved in supporting a caravan of Honduran migrants and refugees earlier this year that also drew the rebuke of Trump. Mujica committed damages and battery, according to the Mexican National Institute of Immigration, alleging Mujica became aggressive when asked for identification.
A Honduran human rights activist and journalist, Bartolo Fuentes, was detained Tuesday in Guatemala. He entered the country the previous day with the caravan, but was singled out, detained, accused of an administration infraction with regard to his entry into Guatemala. He was held in an immigrant detention centre until Friday morning, when he was deported.
Bertha Oliva, a prominent Honduran human rights activist, told Al Jazeera that she and others are concerned not only for charges Fuentes may face, but also for his life.
""We can't even say it was an irregular detention. It was an arbitrary detention,"" said Oliva, the coordinator of the Committee of Relatives of the Detained-Disappeared in Honduras, an organisation she cofounded following her husband's abduction and forced disappearance by a death squad in the early 1980s.
""Nothing justifies the detention. He has not committed any crime,"" she said of Fuentes, adding that at most, he committed an administrative infraction, but he was one of the thousands the Guatemalan government failed to process at the border.
Fuentes's detention and deportation to Honduras come at a time when the government has zero regard for human rights or what international institutions have to say or recommend about human rights violations in Honduras, said Oliva.
""We are in a Honduras that is in a permanent state of emergency,"" she said in a telephone interview.
Fuentes was set to be transferred overland, but was suddenly deported on a flight late Friday morning. After questioning by Honduran immigration agents, he was released, but concerns that he may be arrested and charged remain.
Fuentes is back home, but hundreds of Hondurans are attempting to leave, and the caravan continues in waves.
At the Guatemala-Mexico border on Friday police initially stopped a group of about 1,000 migrants and refugees, using tear gas to turn back the crowd. People then began climbing fences and pushing through. Some within the group were later able to advance, with women and children heading through the gates first. Other groups are heading north behind them.
Vigil said he hopes to at least make it into Mexico. He knows it will be even more difficult to enter the US, and he would be happy trying to make a new life for himself before the caravan reaches its final destination.

""With regard to the threats of the United States government, I don't even think people listen to that,"" human rights activist Yessica Trinidad told Al Jazeera over the phone. ""People leaving have no certainty as to whether or not they will arrive. It is like leaping into an abyss, but for them, it is better than living here,"" said Trinidad, coordinator of the Honduran Network of Women Human Rights Defenders.
The caravan set out Saturday from northwestern Honduras. More than 2,000 people reached Guatemala Monday after a standoff with Guatemalan police at the border. The caravan, now in waves at different points on the route, continues to grow, with some estimates putting it at more than 5,000.
On Thursday, Trump ramped up his threats against the caravan, tweeting that ""in addition to stopping all payments to these countries, which seem to have almost no control over their population, I must, in strongest terms, ask Mexico to stop this onslaught - and if unable to do so I will call up the U.S. Military and CLOSE OUR SOUTHERN BORDER!""
Earlier in the week, he had threatened to cut aid to Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador if the caravan wasn't stopped before it reached the US border.
The warnings came less than a week after the US, Mexico, El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala met in Washington for the second Conference on Prosperity and Security in Central America. As part of its Strategy for Central America, the US has committed about $2.6bn in aid to Central America for 2015 through 2018.
According to the Washington Office on Latin America (WOLA), US aid to Honduras totalled more than $181m last year. The category of security, the justice sector, and violence prevention received more funding than any other, without including funding for borders and drug control. Most of the aid is channelled through the Department of State and US Agency for International Development, but there was also $47m via the Department of Defense last year, according to WOLA.
Adam Isacson, director of WOLA's defence oversight programme, said the number earmarked for this year is likely close to that of 2017. The organisation has not yet been able to obtain country breakdowns of regional security funding but does not expect the final tally will be a big shift from last year.
Isacson said Trump's comments show he does not understand how aid works.
""Trump's tweets betray that our president actually thinks that US aid is a big cash transfer to those countries, like we're just giving them money. And I think a lot of people think that,"" he told Al Jazeera over the phone.
""The president's tweets seem to [suggest] that you're just turning off a cash spigot and there's this river of cash flowing to Honduras,"" Isacson said. ""But of course not a dime goes to Honduras because of the fear it will be stolen. It's all in kind. It's all training or technical services or contractors or equipment for specific things,"" he said.
In addressing the caravan on Wednesday, Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez said: ""Irregular migration has been going on for decades.""
""Since 2014, we decided to deal with structural issues that generate migration. Much has been achieved but we know that there is much for us to continue to do because these are historical problems,"" Hernandez said.
Many human rights activists in Honduras and in the US have expressed concern over the way the Hernandez government has addressed insecurity. They've advocated for years for initiatives that would cut, freeze, or condition US security aid to Honduras.
Honduran police and military forces have been involved in serious human rights violations over the years, according to national and international human rights organisations.
General elections last November that resulted in the contentious reelection of president Juan Orlando Hernandez took place amid widespread allegations of election fraud. Security forces killed more than two dozen people during state crackdowns on protests, according to human rights groups.
Trump would be doing Hondurans a favour if he cut off aid to their government, Trinidad said.
""The aid that the US government gives Honduras is invested precisely in the failed security policy,"" she said.
Honduran human rights and other civil society organisations have been meeting to sort out how they can best assist in the struggle to safeguard the rights of the people on the move, as hundreds more Honduras continue to attempt to leave the country and join the caravan making its way through Guatemala.
Trinidad's organisation and other Honduran human rights groups do not consider the exodus to be immigration, she said.
""For us, this is forced displacement. People are fleeing the country. They are fleeing the constant human rights violations but also different kinds of violence,"" she said.
Human rights violations are also occurring in the context of the migrant caravan, said Trinidad, highlighting the Honduran police actions to block hundreds of Hondurans from leaving through border crossings with Guatemala and El Salvador in order to make their way up to the first wave of the caravan.
""They cannot keep people in the country by force,"" said Trinidad, highlighting the right to freedom of movement, particularly between Honduras and its neighbours.
Honduran human rights groups' long-standing concerns about the actions of security forces are shared by many in the US, including congressional representatives.
Major points of concern have been a 2009 military coup, a 2012 massacre of four indigenous locals during a DEA-assisted drug raid in the Moskitia region, the 2016 murder of prominent Honduran indigenous and social movement activist Berta Caceres, and the violent crackdown on post-election protests in 2017 and this year.
A proposed bill in US Congress would, if passed, suspend all security aid to Honduras and veto any multilateral loans to the country's military and police forces. The bill, called the Berta Caceres Human Rights Act, now has 70 House co-sponsors.
""We should have cut off military aid to Honduras a long time ago, but for very different reasons. Their complete disregard for worker rights, indigenous rights, and individual freedoms are unacceptable in an ally of the United States,"" House Representative Jan Schakowsky, a co-sponsor of the Berta Caceres Human Rights Act, said Thursday in a statement.
Hondurans are fleeing dire economic conditions and a repressive, anti-democratic president supported by Trump and the State Department, said Schakowsky.
""Instead of admitting some responsibility in creating the violent situation in Honduras, President Trump is yet again scapegoating immigrants and refugees,"" she said. ""He is painting a picture of this migrant caravan as a threat to our national security instead of the desperate group of refugees that they are.""

It was the first of three borders they hope to cross with a migrant caravan from Honduras that now has well over 2,000 people and continues to grow.
""I made the decision to join because there is no other alternative. I was overwhelmed by fear,"" Pena told Al Jazeera after entering Guatemala not far from Agua Caliente border crossing.
Pena has been raising her grandchildren in Chamelecon, a city with one of the highest murder rates in Honduras, which is among the world's top 10 countries in terms of per capita homicide rates.
Now 12, 14 and 16 years old, the grandchildren she brought with her were abandoned by their mother. Their father has been living undocumented in the US for the past five years and sends money for food when he can.
The family was living in fear of criminal gang activity in their neighbourhood. Gang members tried to recruit the two boys but it was the threat to Pena's 14-year-old granddaughter from gang members that prompted her to leave Honduras and travel north.
""One of them came over and told me she was going to be his and that if she was not his, she would not be anyone's. He would kill her,"" Pena said. ""It is not possible to argue with those people.""
Pena had planned to leave in December and try to make it to the US. Aside from the children' father, she also has a daughter who has been living legally in the US for 25 years.
On Saturday, as she watched the news about the caravan leaving San Pedro Sula, she decided to leave then and there. Pena and her grandchildren, as well as one of her nephews, took a bus on Sunday to meet up with the group in Ocotepeque, 21 kilometres from the Guatemalan border.
""We felt more strength. We felt safer,"" Pena said of the decision to join the migrant caravan instead of waiting to leave on their own later this year.
Like Pena, the majority of those at the border only found out about the caravan on Saturday, when the group was leaving San Pedro Sula. Others found out and decided to join a day or two prior to departure.
An initial ad hoc group of fewer than 200 people had been planning the trip over Whatsapp chat groups. The migrant caravan has now well surpassed 2,000 people and hundreds more are on their way from different regions of Honduras.
Among them is William Alvarado, who made the trek seven years ago. Sixteen years old at the time, he set out by himself, eventually making his way across the US-Mexico border without documents. He spent years in the US foster system before obtaining a green card. While on a visit home earlier this year, his wallet, along with his green card, was stolen. Alvarado joined the caravan after US embassy staff told him he should turn himself in at the border as a US immigration court would be able to resolve his case more quickly than they could.
Alvarado, Pena and the rest of the group crossed the border into Guatemala on Monday, but not without difficulty. When the caravan arrived at the Guatemalan side of the Agua Caliente border crossing shortly before noon, they found their path blocked by the Guatemalan national police.
For approximately two hours, dozens of police officers formed lines across the highway while governmental and non-governmental human rights representatives discussed the situation with officials.
Babies cried in the heat and high humidity and, within a span of 10 minutes, two children fainted and were carried up into the area between police lines. Red Cross personnel brought in bags of water, but it was not enough to reach the back of the crowd packed onto the highway.
Eventually, families with infants and small children were allowed to pass. After another 30 minutes, the rest streamed into Guatemala, with many cheering 'Yes we can!' as they marched past riot police.
""We want to tell the authorities of Guatemala and tell the president of Guatemala that we are not doing anything wrong,"" Pena said. ""Our mission is just to pass through because the goal is to reach the United States.""
The group was stopped again as it made it way to Esquipulas, about 10km from the border crossing. For more than an hour, Guatemalan police blocked the highway. A section of the crowd closest to police held their identification documents in the air, requesting passage, which was eventually granted.
It was getting dark by the time the caravan arrived in Esquipulas, winding through the city streets on their way to shelters. Local residents showed up at intersections and in doorways, some to hand out water or express support and others out of curiosity.

The caravan was making its way up through southern Guatemala on Tuesday, but the next two borders they eventually plan to cross may prove even more difficult.
Both Mexico and the US Embassy in Honduras issued statements over the weekend, saying migrants will need proper documentation to be able to cross their borders.
On Tuesday, Trump warned that if the caravan of migrants were not stopped, the US would cut off millions of dollars in aid to Honduras.
""The United States has strongly informed the President of Honduras that if the large Caravan of people heading to the U.S. is not stopped and brought back to Honduras, no more money or aid will be given to Honduras, effective immediately.""
The warning came, however, after the caravan had already entered Guatemala.
Those travelling as part of the caravan know they may not make it to the US and what it may mean if they do.
Trump's zero-tolerance immigration policy was heavily scrutinised earlier this year when his administration implemented a practice of separating families at the border. Although the president has since put an end to the practice, hundreds of children remain separated from the families as Trump continues to try to make good on his promise of cracking down on immigration, especially as the November US midterm elections approach.
For Pena, the risks far outweigh the potential consequences of staying in Honduras. She said if they don't make it to the US, she has family they could stay with in Mexico. The most important thing, she said, was getting her grandchildren out of their home country.

""The United States has strongly informed the President of Honduras that if the large Caravan of people heading to the U.S. is not stopped and brought back to Honduras, no more money or aid will be given to Honduras, effectively immediately!"" Trump tweeted Tuesday morning.
The comment came more than three days after 1,000 people set out from San Pedro en route to the US. The caravan, which has now grown to more than 2,000 people, was blocked by Guatemalan police at the border on Monday but was then permitted to enter Guatemala from Honduras.
Hondurans have the right of free movement within the C4 region of Central America, including Guatemala, using basic identification. The Honduran government has no jurisdiction in Guatemala.
Honduran human rights activist Dunia Montoya, who accompanied the caravan to the Guatemalan border and whose husband, Bartolo Fuentes, was detained in Guatemala after crossing with the group, said Trump's tweet ""seems like a further abusive comment on the situation in the country"".
""[Trump] is responsible for the situation in Honduras. The Trump government validated an illegitimate government,"" she told Al Jazeera.
Honduran president Juan Orlando Hernandez, currently in Colombia, has not made an official statement in response to the tweet.
But the Honduran Secretariat of Foreign Affairs issued a statement Tuesday afternoon, saying the government ""urges Hondurans participating in this irregular movement to not let themselves be used by a movement that clearly seems to be political and that seeks to disturb the governability, stability and peace of our countries.""
Honduran democracy has been unstable over the past decade. In 2009, elected president Manuel Zelaya was overthrown and illegally expatriated by the military, though civilian rule continued.
President Hernandez took office in 2014 following a stint as president of congress. His National Party had consolidated majority control of all three branches of government.
Despite the constitutional prohibition on reelection and its use as a justification for the 2009 coup, Hernandez sought reelection following a contentious and irregular Supreme Court ruling essentially declaring part of the constitution to be unconstitutional.
Zelaya's LIBRE party that grew out of popular resistance to the 2009 coup formed an opposition alliance and its candidate Salvador Nasralla was winning the presidency, according to the initial results of general elections held last November. But then Hernandez suddenly surged into the lead amid widespread reports of fraud and irregularities.
Weeks of protests and blockades ensued, and more than two dozen opposition protesters were shot and killed by state security forces, according to Honduran and international human rights organisations.
Hernandez was declared the winner in mid-December, and US recognition of his victory consolidated what was widely viewed as election fraud.
""What is happening in Honduras is the accumulation of the consequences of legitimising a fraudulent government. They provoked this mass migration from Honduras,"" said Montoya.
""Now they threaten not to give money to Honduras, but the truth is that does not alarm the people who are fleeing because that aid never makes it way into their hands,"" she said.
On her husband's arrest in Guatemala, Montoya was unable to confirm the details at the time of publication. Fuentes is a former LIBRE party congressman and a longtime social movement and migrant rights activist. Nineteen years ago, he helped found an association in his hometown of El Progreso, in northwestern Honduras, for relatives of immigrants who had disappeared during their journeys to the US.
Guatemalan President Jimmy Morales is also facing open pressure from the Trump administration to halt the caravan and turn it around.
US Vice President Mike Pence called Morales Tuesday and urged him to ""cooperate"" with the US to curb immigration.
Jorge Santos, the executive director of UDEFEGUA, a Guatemalan non-governmental human rights organisation, accused the Guatemalan government of taking action against the migrant caravan to serve US interests.
""Neither the Guatemalan police nor the army should intervene,"" said Santos.
Guatemala's interior ministry was not immediately available for comment.
Largely on foot at this point, the caravan continues its journey towards the US, though it will likely be days before participants reach Guatemala City. The group left Esquipulas Tuesday morning to try to head another 50km up the road to Chiquimula.
The Honduran national anthem rang out in the plaza outside the Cathedral Basilica, as the last hundreds of migrant caravan participants prepared to leave the city.
The Basilica in Esquipulas is home to a revered wooden ""Black Christ"" image and is a site of religious pilgrimages and excursions from around Guatemala and beyond. Tuesday morning it was the site of a different kind of pilgrimage.
As they prepared to leave Esquipulas on foot, Honduran migrant caravan participants followed up the national anthem with cries of, ""Let's Go!"" and the occasional ""Fuera JOH!,"" in reference to Honduran president Juan Orlando Hernandez.
Hundreds more are attempting to catch up and join the caravan, and many set out from Honduras for Guatemala Tuesday. According to local news reports and footage Tuesday afternoon, Honduran security forces blocked their exit from the country.

""My body went cold,"" Barrera recalled. ""I cried because we were left without our pastor.""
Romero was killed by members of a death squad while performing mass at the Church of the Divine Providence in San Salvador on March 24, 1980.
His death sent shockwaves throughout El Salvador, which was experiencing the start of a civil war that would last more than a decade and leave 75,000 people dead and thousands more disappeared.
The day before his death, Romero publicly denounced the violence carried out by the country's armed forces against civilian populations during a mass at the National Cathedral.
""In the name of God … I beg you, I beseech you, I order you to stop the repression,"" he said.
On Sunday, nearly four decades later, Romero, along with six others including Pope Paul VI, was made a saint.
Tens of thousands, including Barrera, marched through San Salvador as part of the procession of celebration that ultimately arrived at the National Cathedral. Thousands remained through the night to listen to the Pope Francis's declaration, which occurred at 2:00am (08:00 GMT) in El Salvador.
Barrera described the time she met Romero as a teen. The now 63-year-old had lunch with him on a visit to her village of El Rosario, Cuscatlan in 1978.
""He was very humble,"" she reflected.
""I knew he would be declared a saint,"" Barrera told Al Jazeera. ""I'm honoured and privileged to say that I once ate with this saint.
Tears of joy, cheers, and shouts of ""Your people made you a saint"" filled the Gerardo Barrios plaza on Sunday in front of the Cathedral as Pope Francis declared Romero a saint.
Similar vigils occurred in parishes across El Salvador in commemoration of the canonisation of Romero, including at the Church of the Divine Providence in San Salvador, where Romero was murdered.
Maria Barrera
Romero's path to sainthood began in 2015, when Vatican theologians declared him a martyr, saying he was killed ""in hatred of the faith"".
The Church then looked to verify a miracle attributed to Romero, which was confirmed and the canonisation process started, despite deep opposition from some within the Vatican who viewed Romero's life and symbolism after his death too political.
Romero was deeply loved by the poor of El Salvador and of Latin America for whom he dedicated much of his life. During the canonisation ceremony, Pope Francis praised Romero for being ""close to the poor and to his people"".
""This is a moment of pride for Latin America,"" said Elvia Cazun, a 38-year-old nun who has worked in the Monsenor Romero Historical Center for the last four years. ""[He was] someone who lived the experiences of the people,"" she told Al Jazeera ""A pastor must be at the side of the people in their suffering.""
Barrera said he liked to be on the same level as the people he served.
""If he was told that he would be given food that is better than the others, he never wanted it,"" she recalled. ""He wanted to eat what all the others were eating,"" she added.
Romero's concern for the poor began after seeing the realities of migrant labourers who travelled to San Miguel for the coffee harvest.
""He saw the poverty that the labourers faced,"" said Cazun. ""From this moment, he accompanied them.""
In the course of the beginning of the civil war, which lasted from 1979 through 1992 and left more than 75,000 people dead and thousands more disappeared, he became an outspoken critic of the violence against El Salvador's poor, as well as the rampant inequalities in the country.
""Romero was concerned for the situation of the people,"" Barrera told Al Jazeera. ""People arrived from small villages to tell him that there was repression. He stood in solidarity with the people and denounced these injustices.""
After his death, Romero became a symbol throughout Latin America with graffiti, signs and memorabilia lining the streets throughout major cities of El Salvador.
""Romero was the voice of those who did not have a voice,"" Barrera said. ""He was with the poor. He became a saint because his people had already declared him a saint. He is the saint of the poor of the world.""

The truck was travelling on a highway in the Izmir region close to Izmir airport on Sunday when it flipped and fell into the channel several metres below, Anadolu news agency said.
Turkish television showed the wreckage of the vehicle with corpses strewn nearby; the truck had been reduced to burned-out metal by the impact of the crash.
Thirteen people were injured and taken by ambulance to nearby hospitals, according to local media.
DHA news agency said the driver of the vehicle, a Turkish man aged 35, survived and told police from his hospital bed that he had swerved to avoid a white oncoming vehicle.
The dead included two babies and two children as well as a pregnant woman, DHA reported.
The truck's passengers were foreigners who had reached a deal with traffickers to be transported by boat to the Greek island of Samos, south of Izmir.
Turkey became one of the main launch points for more than a million refugees and asylum seekers taking the sea route to EU countries in 2015, many fleeing conflict and poverty in the Middle East and Africa.
The influx of people was drastically curtailed by a 2016 accord between Ankara and the European Union after hundreds died crossing to Greek islands a few miles off Turkey.
According to UN figures, more than 24,500 migrants and refugees have arrived in Greece by sea so far this year, with 118 people losing their lives via this route.
Last week, eight people were found drowned off the Karaburun district, also in Izmir province, after their boat capsized.
Twenty-six others are still officially listed as missing after that accident, according to Anadolu.

""It's something which doesn't compare to anything else,"" said Ahmed Koki, a Tebu-language activist from Libya, about the feeling of writing in his mother tongue.
It was autumn 2013 when Koki's hometown of Murzuk, in Libya's remote southernmost province of Fezzan, was being littered with the first publications ever written in the Tebu language - also called Tudaga - in Libya.
The Tebu were victims of Muammar Gaddafi's brutal assimilation campaigns seeking to eliminate indigenous cultures and languages.
Many Tebu in Libya were deprived of citizenship, preventing them from getting healthcare, education and employment. It was only after Gaddafi's fall that Koki and his people could speak up for their rights.
Younis Tobway, former culture minister
Seven years after Gaddafi's death, cultural manifestations of Libya's non-Arab indigenous peoples, such as the Amazigh or the Tebu, are no longer forbidden, but instability fostered by two rival legislatures - the internationally recognised GNA and the eastern-based House of Representatives (HOR) - doesn't help to support their language.
Despite the ongoing chaos in Libya, the Tebu managed to reshuffle in the so-called ""National Tebu Assembly"", their main organisation in the country.
From a hotel in Tunis, Adam Rami Kerki, head of the NTA, described ""widespread racism"" in Libya.
""Many in Libya insist in rooting their identity in the Arab culture, but we had not heard about that until the arrival of Gaddafi to power in 1969,"" said Kerki.
""We may not be Arabs but we are doubtless Libyans,"" he added, as he referred to the lack of institutional support since the end of Gaddafi's mandate.
As a former minister of culture in the National Salvation Government - the executive which was overthrown by the GNA in March 2016, Younis Tobway subscribed to Kerki's assessment on the neglect of his people.
""We only get promises on paper and endless speeches highlighting the importance of diversity in Libya from whoever reaches power, but nothing ever happens afterwards,"" Tobway told Al Jazeera by phone.
What the Libyan Tebu have achieved so far has been by their own effort, he said, explaining that they had already started working way before the 2011 uprising that deposed Libya's former ruler.
""I still remember the first time I came across a book written in Tudaga. A friend had brought it across the border from Chad. It was the late '90s and we had to keep it secret as we would have surely gone to jail if Gaddafi's police found out,"" recalled Libya's only Tebu minister.
Along with the Tuareg - another non-Arab indigenous people - and the former Gaddafi loyalist tribe of Awad Suleyman, the Tebu have been dominant in Libya's Fezzan region.
It's a vast area sitting at a regional crossroads, linking Libya's south to the Sahel and sub-Saharan migrant routes through northern Libya and onto Europe.
The absence of a central authority is more visible here than anywhere else in the country, with porous borders paving the way for smuggling of all types: people, oil, gold, weapons, drugs and even books when it comes to the Tebu.
Lying deep in the Tibesti Massif, a rocky mountain range in the extreme north of Chad which also spills over into southern Libya, Bardai has been the ""capital"" of overall Tebu culture for over a century.
In Chad, they are considered to be a prestigious community and their culture has never been threatened as in Libya.
In 1993, Mark and Sheryl Ortman reached that border area with their four children - the fifth would be born in Chad.
The American couple was working in the framework of a minority languages programme run by SIL (originally the Summer Institute of Linguistics), an NGO focusing on language normalisation in developing countries.
The Tibesti was their home until 1999, when a rebellion forced them to leave the region. By then, the Ortmans had already helped develop an alphabet for the Tebu language and they would return to Chad in 2001.
""We opted for a Latin-based alphabet as the national language in Chad is French; it serves as a bridge between Tebu and literacy in the national language,"" Sheryl Ortman explained over the phone from the Tibesti mountains.
It is actually not that strange that a philanthropic organisation sets up an alphabet for a people whose existence is almost ignored by the rest of the world.
Ortman's most immediate precedent might have been that of Wolfgang Feuerstein, a German linguist who did the same in the 1980s with the Laz - a Caucasian people living between the borders of Turkey and Georgia. Whereas Feuerstein was forced to complete his job from his village in Germany's Black Forest, the Ortmans managed to stay and, eventually, become part of the community.
""Our children have grown up among the Tebu and, every day, I am increasingly aware of how much we have come to share,"" highlighted the American linguist.
In the meantime, Edji Mahmoud, a local Tebu who had been working hand in hand with Ortman from the mid-'90s, came up with the idea of establishing a cultural centre in Bardai.
""After the fall of Gaddafi and then seeing the Tebu in Libya use all our work to publish newspapers and journals in our language, I thought we needed to step up once again and make Bardai the base of further language development,"" remembered the 45-year-old, who was also involved in the birth of the alphabet.
His cousin had a small cement brick building which was unused and he agreed not only to share the place, but also refurbish it, adding terraces, buying tables and shelves.
By July 2012, the cultural centre opened its doors. Although everybody works on a voluntary basis, funds and books from private donors are also key.
""The focal point is a six-week Tebu-language course leading up to a highly publicised writing contest and finishing with an awards ceremony attended by all government officials, including the governor,"" stressed Mahmoud before adding that all the activities at the centre allow his people to see that the Tebu language ""does not have to take a backseat to any other language"".
According to Mahmoud, putting Tebu first has also the additional benefit of giving Tebu children a greater opportunity for success in the French language government school.
""Once they can read in their own language, the letters of the French alphabet actually make sense to them,"" he said.
According to a report released by Amnesty International in July 2018, Chadian authorities cut spending on education by 21 percent between 2014 and 2016, undermining the access of many to schools and universities.
In many ways, Bardai's centre also tries to fill that gap and much of what takes place there would not be possible without Anja and Simon Neuhaus.
This Swiss couple in their 30s wanting to see the rugged, isolated Tibesti Massif for themselves, agreed in 2011 to visit Bardai with Mahmoud and Ortman. Once there, they decided to join hands for six months to get the centre started in 2012.
They now spend half the year in Bardai and the other half at home in Switzerland, where they develop apps, enlarge the dictionary and produce teaching videos and cartoons.
The dictionary work is done in collaboration with Hassan Bedeimi, a Tebu linguist and publicist from Gatroun, Libya, who worked for years in secret during Gaddafi's years and now shares his collection of 15,000 words with Simon.
""Alongside many other endeavours, our goal is to give the Tebu language status, to affirm that it is equally valuable like any other by publishing books, chiefly the dictionary,"" Simon Neuhaus explained.
The Swiss linguist also helps to manage the centre's website where all the publications in Tudaga, as well as videos and pictures from their activities, are available.
Even fellow Libyans are helping in this process.
In November 2017, a delegation of Libyan Tebus was invited to a workshop in Tripoli where Libyan Amazigh lecturers briefed them on their own language normalisation process.
The Amazigh also share the same story of repression under Gaddafi's rule and they have been a source of inspiration for the Tebu activists since the beginning of their activities.
Over the past seven years, Amazigh school books have gradually been released and their language is taught at their schools.
There's even an Amazigh Language Department at the university campus in Zuwara, an Amazigh coastal enclave.
Osman Hamid, one of the 10 Tebu who attended the course said he was ""highly impressed"" by the huge steps their hosts have made over the last years.
One of the first ideas he and his friends adopted from their Amazigh friends was a dictionary app.
The first Tudaga-Arabic-English-French dictionary, published in 2015, is now available wherever there's internet. Borders, says Hamid, are now more porous than ever.
""Even in a country in shambles such as ours, these people have proved that you can achieve a lot if you have the will to do things,"" said the 54-year-old chemistry teacher, who would ""smuggle"" Tebu books across the border back in Gaddafi's times.

https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/10/plans-harder-green-card-181010124607862.html,migrant,1366,Wed Oct 10 2018 22:57:58 GMT+0000,Jurriaan van Eerten,US plans to make it harder for some people to get a green card,"Tucson, Arizona - The first thing Alfredo* bought for his parents when he started working was a refrigerator. He was still in Mexico, in the city of Mazatlan in Sinaloa, where he worked in a little store.
But he wanted a better life, so he moved on with his wife and child. First to the state of Sonora, later crossing the border to Arizona in 1993 on a US visitor's visa.
In Arizona, Alfredo washed dishes in a restaurant for a year, a job he got through another migrant he had met.
Eventually, he found himself working as a handyman, plumber and landscaper throughout Tucson.
From the moment he started working, Alfredo sent money back to his parents. The money was for improvements to the house he grew up in, which had no plumbing nor electricity.
All those years in Tucson, Alfredo paid taxes using an International Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN). He wanted to follow the rules of the new country he was living in, which he also believed would eventually help him become a US citizen.
Now, 26 years later, Alfredo finally received his green card, giving him the opportunity to travel back to his home country and his family for the first time since he left.
In five years, as the rules now dictate, he will also be able to become a US citizen.
But Alfredo considers himself lucky. He received his green card as the Trump administration announced a proposal that, if implemented, would have possibly blocked him from obtaining it, according to his immigration lawyer, Rachel Wilson.
Under the proposed rule change, announced in September and officially published on Wednesday, immigration authorities could deny green cards, visas or even admission to immigrants who use or may use public assistance programmes, including food stamps, non-emergency Medicaid, housing vouchers and other types of federal assistance.
Although immigrants must already prove they won't be a ""public charge"", the proposal details that the use or potential use of public assistance programmes may now work against their applications.
Alfredo and his wife did accept food stamps for their baby daughter 20 years ago.
""We got food stamps for her in the first years after she was born,"" Alfredo told Al Jazeera, sitting in the office of his immigration lawyer. ""Because we were just starting, this gave us that little extra to make ends meet.""
Because their daughter was a US citizen, they were eligible for food stamps as a household. The stamps were to buy eggs, milk and tortillas. As soon as Alfredo made enough money, she no longer went to collect the stamps.
Additionally, an individual's English proficiency level may factor into the decision on his or her application. For Alfredo, this may have proved difficult as his English is limited to his work as a handyman.
It remains unclear if past use of food stamps or limited English proficiency would be deemed a ""public charge"" under the proposal, which lawyers said is part of the problem.
""The difficulty with this new rule is that it's all very vague,"" Wilson told Al Jazeera.
""We don't know for sure if those food stamps would be a problem because the parents were only the ones picking them up. They were officially for the daughter. But their daughter was just born, so she couldn't do that by herself,"" Wilson said.
""What they clearly don't take into account in the new rule is the 26 years of paying taxes. Under the new rule, these don't count against the possibility that the applicant might have to make use of public assistance in the future.""
Advocates also fear the new proposal will adversely affect low-income individuals, as well as those with disabilities.
""This proposal says work and family don't matter - only money matters,"" the National Immigration Law Center said in a statement last month when the rule was first announced.
Center on Budget and Policy Priorities
Rights groups warn that immigrants may forgo desperately needed public assistance out of fear of losing their eligibility for legal resident status.
The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a research institute promoting accessibility of the food-stamp programme, worries specifically for pregnant women and young children.
It said in a September statement: ""Children may lose access to benefits that, in their later years, could mean better health, higher educational achievement, more work, and greater earnings.""
The public-charge rule dates back the Immigration Act of 1882, which included a clause that allowed for denial of entry to ""any convict, lunatic, idiot or any person unable to take care of himself without becoming a public charge"".
Immigrants had to prove they had at least $25 to be able to provide for themselves until they found a job.
Since then, its implementation has varied depending on the administration.
For example, the public-charge rule was enforced more strongly during the 1930s by President Herbert Hoover.
The current proposed rule would narrow the definition of public charge.
""This proposed rule will implement a law passed by Congress intended to promote immigrant self-sufficiency and protect finite resources by ensuring that they are not likely to become burdens on American taxpayers,"" Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen said in a statement last month.
Rachel Wilson, lawyer
In the new rules, it's also possible for immigration services to demand a public-charge bond of $10,000 or more if they decide a migrant might become a public charge.
""That bond is another problem,"" Wilson told Al Jazeera. ""There is only a minimum amount given, no maximum. So the official might as well ask for an amount no one is able to pay unless they are very rich.""
Wilson said she doesn't understand why the government tries to exclude a certain part of the migrant population.
""The people who clean your room in a fancy hotel are immigrants; they are part of the fabric of our society. We need that labour here. When we start saying, 'we want people from this country and not from that country' ... well, you will start to find a lot of ugliness underneath that.""
DHS stated that it receives seven million applications for permanent residency, immigration status and temporary work visa every year.
Since 2001, roughly one million people obtain green cards yearly. According to Pew Research Institute, the majority already live in the US.
USA Today reported that the proposed rule could affect more than 380,000 applicants each year.
Wilson believes that more than 50 percent of her clients could be affected by the new rules and as a result, won't be able to apply for a green card any more.
""I think this is an incredibly unfair policy. To use this public-charge rule to exclude people as if they are not part of this society is abhorrent,"" Wilson said.
The official version of the proposed rule was published on the Federal Register on Wednesday. The public has until December 10 to make comments and suggestions on the rule. Changes may be made before the rule is implemented. The rule changes are expected to go into effect at the beginning of next year.
So close to the November midterm elections, many say the proposal seems to be a way for the Trump administration to show how serious they are about closing the borders.
Although Alfredo and his wife received their green cards, the couple still isn't completely confident about their situation as of yet. They are now in their five-year probation period before they can become US citizens.
Due to the ever-uncertain changing immigration laws and regulations, Alfredo and his wife were advised by their lawyer not to use their real names when speaking to the media.
""That feels like something strange to do,"" Alfredo said. ""We are not criminals. We have nothing to hide; we just have no idea what will happen with this administration and to us if we come forward with our names.""
Wilson nodded and said: ""Them having to talk about this anonymously just goes to show what we have become in the United States. Immigration has always existed on earth. We go where there is work; we go where there is safety.""
*Name has been changed to protect the individual's identity.

Luca Traini, 28, embarked on a shooting spree on February 4, following the murder of a young Italian woman by suspected Nigerian drug dealers.
Pamela Mastropietro's body was found dismembered and stuffed into suitcases days before Traini's attack.
The two incidents, which occurred during Italy's tense electoral campaign, shook the country and laid bare its deep tensions surrounding immigration.
Pro-migrant demonstrations across Italy condemning the attack were in contrast to an outpouring of support for Traini who received messages of solidarity for his actions. Controversially, no politicians visited his victims in hospital.
Traini was charged with attempted murder and racial hatred.
The former security guard admitted to the shooting but rejected allegations the attack was racially-motivated, insisting he wanted to target drug dealers.
His defence team had provided a psychiatric report which stated that Traini suffered from a personality disorder and that he was not completely aware of his actions at the time of the attack.

The Moroccan interior ministry said in a statement on Tuesday that a naval unit operating in the Mediterranean was ""forced"" to fire on the boat because its Spanish driver ""refused to obey"" orders.
The incident happened off the Moroccan locality of M'diq-Fnideq, official news agency MAP reported.
The woman who succumbed to her injuries in hospital was 22 years old and the three wounded - one in a critical condition with an amputated arm - were also Moroccans, Mohamed Benaissa, head of the Northern Observatory for Human Rights, told AFP news agency.
The Spanish driver of the boat was unharmed and later arrested, he said.
A total of 25 people were on the boat, including the people traffickers who were Spanish nationals, Benaissa added.
According to the interior ministry, the boat, which has been seized and an investigation opened, was illegally transporting migrants.
It was the second time in recent days that Morocco's royal navy intervened to stop a boat suspected of carrying migrants across the Mediterranean, and comes amid growing concerns about migrant trafficking in the western Mediterranean region.
Morocco became the main launchpad for Europe-bound sub-Saharan African migrants in July after Italy took a tougher line and European Union aid to the Libyan coastguard stemmed flows from Libya.
So far this year, Moroccan officials said they foiled more than 54,000 crossing attempts to Europe.
Some 13 percent of those would-be migrants are Moroccans while the rest come from other African countries.
Since the beginning of September, social media networks in Morocco have been inundated with videos showing young people from the North African country heading to Spain on board inflatable boats.
More than 38,852 people have crossed into Spain up to mid-September, UN data shows, at least twice as many as during the same period of 2017.

A pair of twins about 17 months old, as well as their parents were among the fatalities, MSF said in a statement on Monday, quoting a survivor.
The two boats had set out from the Libyan coast early on September 1, each carrying scores of people, mostly from African countries such as Sudan, Mali, Nigeria, Cameroon, Ghana, Libya, Algeria and Egypt.
One boat's engine failed and the other began to deflate, the aid agency quoted a survivor as saying.
Some survived by clinging to floating wreckage. Many people were brought to the Libyan port of Khoms on September 2 by the Libyan coastguard, MSF said.
""While the first boat had stopped due to an engine failure, our boat continued to navigate and began deflating around 1pm. There were 165 adults and 20 children on board,"" a survivor told MSF.
The survivor said that at the time of the incident, mobile phone navigation showed the people were not far from the coast of Malta.
They reportedly sought help from the Italian coastguard, but the boat started sinking before assistance arrived.
""We couldn't swim and only a few people had life jackets. Those among us who could hold on the boat's floating hood stayed alive,"" the survivor said.
MSF treated survivors with chemical burns from the engine petrol spills.
""Our medical team worked solidly for several hours to assist survivors with the most serious conditions,"" said Jai Defranciscis, an MSF nurse working in Misrata, northwest Libya.
As of July 1, at least 1,000 people drowned at sea while trying to cross to Europe since the beginning of the year, according to the United Nations.
In June, as the Italian government and the Libyan coastguard imposed more restrictions, more than 200 people drowned in the Mediterranean.
In 2017, more than 3,000 people died or went missing.
Arrivals to Italy - and to Europe overall - more than halved in 2017 to just over 172,300.
In February 2017, the previous Italian government signed a memorandum of understanding on migration with Libya's UN-backed Government of National Accord.
With European Union approval, Italy began training and equipping Libya's coastguard to perform rescues, ""pulling back"" migrant boats.

At a special meeting of the OAS on Wednesday, member nations described the exodus of Venezuelans to neighbouring countries as a migrant crisis ""without precedent"" in the Western Hemisphere.
Luis Almagro said that different countries should grant legal status to Venezuelan migrants while working to integrate them socially and economically.
He also announced the creation of a working group that will visit the borders and areas where displaced Venezuelans are settling.
""The exodus is causing significant pressure for several countries that, despite their good intentions, have limitations when attending those who come in,"" said Almagro.
""They can't do it alone, no country can do it alone. It must be a collective action with a shared responsibility approach,"" he added.
However, Venezuela and Nicaragua announced that they would not accept any decisions taken in the meeting.
Delegates from Mexico, Brazil, Colombia, Peru and the United States also called on Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro to accept food and medical supplies for his country's most vulnerable people and allow international aid groups to work in the country.
But Maduro has rejected offers made by groups to deliver aid, arguing that it as part of a plan to destabilise his socialist government.
""The situation in Venezuela is not a natural disaster, but entirely man-made,"" said Alexis Ludwig, the deputy US representative to the OAS.
""President Maduro should unconditionally allow international food and medical assistance to reach the neediest in Venezuela.""
A Venezuelan diplomat at the meeting ignored these requests, saying that the discussion on the country's migrant crisis is part of a US-led plot to justify an invasion.

On Tuesday, 11 Latin American countries also agreed to allow Venezuelans leaving the country to enter their countries even if their passports have expired.
Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Mexico, Panama, Paraguay, Peru and Uruguay made the announcement following a two-day meeting in the Ecuadorean capital, Quito.
Meanwhile, under the ""Return to the Homeland plan"", Venezuela's government agreed with the UN on Wednesday to work together and provide technical support for people who want to return.
According to local reports, around 300 Venezuelans gathered outside their country's embassy in Peru on Tuesday and requested to go back.
Where Venezuelans are going: Colombia (roughly 1 million), Peru (400k), Ecuador (250k), Brazil (52k). These numbers are fluid. Not exact. Best guess estimates. UNHCR says between Jan-June this year 117,000 Venezuelans have requested asylum abroad.
The Venezuelans, some of whom said they had been sleeping on the streets and had been taken advantage of by Peruvian employers, arrived hours after Maduro announced a plan to welcome back those who had left the country on national TV.
""I sometimes feel pain for the Venezuelans who left,"" said Maduro on Monday, adding that fewer than 600,000 Venezuelans left the country over the past two years and that 90 percent regret the decision.
""We will embrace you again, come to Venezuela, come back to the homeland. We Venezuelans are here, with our big, big Bolivian hearts.""
According to the UN, more than 1.6 million Venezuelans have left their homeland since 2015 to escape severe shortages of food and medicine and inflation that the IMF estimates will reach one million percent this year.
The UN's migration agency has compared the exodus of citizens to the situation of refugees in the Mediterranean.
""This is very sad,"" Joander Perez, a 15-year-old Venezuelan who travelled more than 4,000km with members of his family, told Al Jazeera at the border.
""We were at the best time of our lives, with friends, school, family but we have to leave to find a better life. In Venezuela, we were hungry.""

Qatar's emir signed the new law on Tuesday, amending certain provisions to the existing law that required all migrant workers getting permission from their employers before leaving Qatar, said Minister of Administrative Development, Labour and Social Affairs Issa al-Nuaimi in a statement. With this new law, migrant workers covered by the Labour Code would be able to leave Qatar without having to obtain such a permit, the statement added. ""The adoption of this law is another step in our continued drive to provide decent work for all migrant workers in Qatar and to ensure their protection,"" al-Nuaimi added. The amendment is a significant step as part of reforms that Qatar is carrying out, according to Head of the ILO Project Office in Qatar Houtan Homayounpour.
""This is a huge step taken by the Qatar government. It's a big deal,"" Homayounpour told Al Jazeera on Wednesday. ""The workers are now free to leave anytime while respecting the contractual agreements.
""This will not cover all the workers, including domestic workers and those working in the military. Qatar already has a law on domestic workers and we're working closely on getting a ministerial decree to grant them the same rights."" Employers in Qatar can still submit names of workers for whom a No-Objection Certificate (NOC) would be required before granting them permission to leave the country, according to the statement, which added that it needed justifications based on the nature of the work. Qatar is one of the wealthiest countries in the world but its treatment of foreign workers from countries such as India, Nepal and Bangladesh has come under scrutiny as it spends billions of dollars on building new infrastructure in the run-up to hosting the 2022 football World Cup. A work-sponsorship system, known as Kefala, required all foreign workers to obtain their employer's consent to travel abroad or switch jobs, a measure that rights groups said leaves workers prone to exploitation and forced labour. But with the government doing away with the need for an exit visa for most workers, Homayounpour said that ""the power imbalance between workers and employers was starting to be addressed"". ""This now eliminates 50 percent of the problem. It was the workers' fundamental right to leave when they wished to. If they find themselves in a problematic situation or a family emergency, or simply want to go on a vacation, they can leave,"" he said. ""And with regards to spreading the word, the government and ourselves, are undertaking many activities in order to raise the awareness of workers and employers on this important change to the law.""

Issuing a new law, Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani directed the government on Tuesday to grant permanent residency to 100 expatriates every year. The law also allows most migrant workers to leave the country without an exit visa.
The new permanent residency law gives priority to children born to a Qatari mother, as well as foreign nationals who have lived in the country for more than 20 years and are considered ""valuable"" for their skills.
Some two million foreign residents live in Qatar.
Under the new law, permanent residents are entitled to the same social security as Qatar's citizens, including free healthcare and education in government schools. They will also be given priority in government jobs.
As permanent residents, foreign expatriates investing in Qatar will no longer be required to have a Qatari citizen as their partners. The new law also allows them to own real estate in the country.
Once the new law is implemented, permanent residents will be able to enter and leave the country without permission from their employers, which is required for other residents.
The landmark law also allows expatriates serving in the Qatari armed forces to apply for permanent residency.
A Sudanese citizen, serving in the Qatari army for decades, told Al Jazeera on condition of anonymity that he is in the process applying to become a permanent resident.
Abdullah al-Athbah
Analysts say the new law is part of Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani's ambitious Vision 2030, which aims to create a sustainable and modern Qatar in the next 10 years.
""This law would serve as a gesture of appreciation to many of our Arab brothers who have lived among us for decades and made an honourable stand, supporting Qatar against the siege by the neighbouring countries,"" Abdullah al-Athbah, chief editor of Qatari newspaper Al Arab, told Al Jazeera.
In June 2017, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Egypt severed diplomatic ties with Qatar, accusing it of funding ""terrorism"" and fomenting regional instability - allegations Doha denies.
Al-Athbah said the new law is a ""first step"" in Qatar's ""investment in human capital"", which will benefit the state in vital areas such as medicine, science and engineering.
""The pioneering new law is part of a national strategy of modernisation and sustained development,"" a senior Qatari official, who declined to be identified, told Al Jazeera.
On plans to grant just 100 permanent residencies a year, al-Athbah said the move will allow the government to evaluate its policy, revise it and expand it as needed in the years to come.
Qatar is one of the richest countries in the world with an average income of nearly $124,000 a year, a figure that surpasses many Western countries, including the United States.

The United Nation's migration agency said the exodus of citizens out of Venezuela is nearing a ""crisis moment"" comparable to the situation of refugees in the Mediterranean.
""There has been an intent to convert a normal migratory flow into a humanitarian crisis in order to justify an international intervention in Venezuela,"" Vice President Rodriguez told a news conference on Monday.
""We will not allow it.""
She criticised foreign agencies for using numbers on Venezuelan emigration provided by other countries.
According to the United Nations, nearly 2.3 million Venezuelans are currently living abroad and more than 1.6 million have left since 2015.
President Nicolas Maduro said in a televised broadcast on Monday that opposition protests and US financial sanctions had led some Venezuelans to ""try their luck"" in other countries but many were reconsidering that decision.
""More than 90 percent are regretting it, of this group that isn't more than 600,000 Venezuelans who have left the country in the last two years, according to confirmed, certified serious figures,"" he said.
Images of Venezuelans leaving the country on foot have raised alarms through the region as countries such as Ecuador, Peru and Chile seek to prepare for the growing influx of migrants.
""The situation is dramatic,"" Ronal Rodriguez, a professor and researcher at the Venezuelan Observatory, a think-tank at the University of Rosario in Colombia, told Al Jazeera.
""There are cases of hypothermia, people who come from the coast and are exposed to temperatures they are not used to, these are not planned trips.""
""Some people receive help, but others are harassed. Many die on the road, and family members are forced to leave them behind to continue the journey. The internal changes taking place in the country are making things worse,"" Rodriguez explained.
On Monday, 13 countries in Latin America met in the Ecuadorean capital, Quito, to discuss regional strategies for managing the flow of migrants, with conclusions to be announced on Tuesday.
""We need to make the crisis visible and channel economic aid"" to host countries and migrants, Ecuador's acting Foreign Minister Andres Teran said while inaugurating the two-day meeting.
The meeting will seek humanitarian solutions to help Venezuelan migrants who risk being left without work or being exploited by employers, or becoming victims of sexual exploitation, human trafficking and xenophobia, Teran said.
Governments initially welcomed the migrants with open arms, remembering Venezuela's role in welcoming those fleeing dictatorships and conflicts in the past.
But the exodus has ballooned this year, stretching social services, creating more competition for low-skilled jobs and stoking fears of unrest.
In the past weeks, both Ecuador and Peru announced tighter entry rules for Venezuelans, requiring them to carry valid passports instead of national ID cards.
Ecuador also declared a state of emergency in three northern states which receive up to 4,200 Venezuelans daily.
""Migrants are in need of help,"" Rodriguez of the Venezuelan Observatory said. ""They need to be regularised, we know that many are being exploited. They are not identifiable, so if they die or they are killed, it is not easy to know who they were.""
""We also know of children that are being sold and are victims of trafficking, Venezuelan women are also being stigmatised, as many resort to prostitution,"" he added.
Monday's meeting was attended by senior officials from Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Peru, Mexico, Panama, Paraguay and Uruguay, according to the Ecuadorian Foreign Ministry.
Colombia, Peru and Ecuador asked on Thursday for international aid to manage the migration surge that is overwhelming public services.

https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/09/trump-weighs-house-republicans-midterm-campaign-starts-180903053608128.html,migrant,1265,Mon Sep 03 2018 15:04:01 GMT+0000,William Roberts,Trump weighs on House Republicans as midterm campaign starts,"Washington, DC - Republican Congressman Mike Bost's big political moment this election year came in July when he and President Donald Trump toured the Granite City Steel Works near St Louis in the US heartland.
The president, appearing at a rally with Bost and other Illinois congressional Republicans, touted his steel tariffs and promised to bring industrial jobs back to the Midwest.
People in Illinois' 12th district voted 55-40 percent for Trump over Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election. Yet Bost, who has embraced Trump, is in a tight race for re-election this year.
""This is a competitive race that leans maybe slightly Republican is the way I would rate it,"" said John Jackson, a political science professor at the Paul Simon Institute of Public Policy at the University of Southern Illinois in Carbondale.
In a telling sign, the Granite City steelworkers union threw their support to Bost's Democrat challenger, Brendan Kelly, a former state prosecutor and political moderate.
On November 6, some 80 million voters - perhaps more depending on turnout - will cast ballots for all 435 seats in the House of Representatives where Republicans currently hold a 23-seat majority.
Historically called ""midterm"" elections, the vote is essentially a referendum on the party of the president, whose performance in office is watched closely.
""Trump's job approval is one of the critical factors and thus there is some reason to believe a Democratic wave is coming,"" Jackson told Al Jazeera.
Recent polls show US voters increasingly hold negative views of the president. Sixty percent of registered voters in a joint August 29 poll by The Washington Post and ABC News disapproved of the job the president is doing, up from 54 percent in April.
Now, as Republicans begin their re-election campaigns in earnest, most analysts are predicting that the Democrats will gain control of the House, an outcome that would match historical norms.
""My forecast is that the Democrats will pick up a net of about 30 House seats. I don't see a huge wave. But I think they will take the House,"" said Greg Valliere, chief global strategist and Washington analyst at Horizon Investments LLC, a financial advisory firm.
Republican losses, however, easily could be higher depending on the depth of a potential backlash against Trump.
Republicans face credible challenges from Democrats in 62 congressional districts while Democrats face competition in only four, according to The Cook Political Report, a non-partisan publisher of US political analysis.
In the state of California, affluent suburban voters in Orange County have historically provided Republicans with a reliable base of support. Not so this year.
""We used to be the county that Ronald Reagan said all good Republicans go to die [in],"" Dan Chmielewski, publisher of TheLiberalOC, an Orange County political blog, told Al Jazeera.
""Hillary won Orange Country in 2016, the first time a Democrat has taken this county since Franklin Delano Roosevelt. There are significant cities that have voter registrations that are majority Democrat now,"" he said.
Three Orange County Republicans face Democratic challengers in races analysts rate as toss-ups.
In the agricultural San Joaquin and San Fernando valleys, where Hispanics make up one-third or more of voters and Trump's anti-immigrant policies hurt migrant workers, two more Republicans face competitive races.
In particular, Representative Dana Rohrbacher, now in his 15th term as a congressman, faces criticism at home for his connections to Russians amid the US Department of Justice's special investigation into Trump's campaign and potential collusion with Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.
Rohrbacher blames a ""deep state"" conspiracy for the investigation of Trump and says he doubts the veracity of criminal charges brought against Russians by Special Counsel Robert Mueller.
Rohrbacher's opponent Harley Rouda has aggressively tied him to Trump and argued the Republican congressman has failed to hold the president accountable, a campaign theme that plays well in California.
Nationwide, a combination of demographic change and disaffection with Trump's brand of politics - particularly among suburban white, college-educated women - has created a challenge for incumbent House Republicans who four years ago might have counted on easy re-elections.
""The House battlefield is largely in districts that either Clinton won, or where Trump didn't really run that far ahead. There are a lot of suburban districts where they like Republicans but maybe not a Republican like Trump,"" Kyle Kondik, who analyzes House races for the University of Virginia Center on Politics, told Al Jazeera. ""And so, I don't think the president is an asset.""
Democrats have led Republicans in national congressional preference polls all year. The average spread has widened recently to 8.4 percent, according to RealClearPolitics.com.
House races in Texas are emblematic both of the depth of Republican troubles this year and how American politics are shifting at the grassroots level in response to Trump.
Representative John Culberson has held the wealthy Texas 7th district in suburban Houston for 18 years. It's a district that was held by former President George H W Bush when he began his political career. Today, it is more diverse, with a population that is 44 percent white, 32 percent Hispanic, 13 percent black, and 10 percent Asian.
Culberson now faces a tough challenge by Democrat Lizzie Fletcher, a relatively inexperienced, progressive liberal who is focusing her campaign on organising local turnout and resentment about the federal response to Hurricane Harvey, a category-4 storm that caused $125bn in damage in August and September 2017.
A senior member of the House committee that doles out federal money, Culberson played a key role in delivering billions in federal aid to Texas after Harvey but hasn't been personally visible in the district. Like many other Republicans, his hopes of campaigning on the popularity of a huge tax cut enacted in 2017 under Trump have fallen flat.
""An awful lot of Republicans thought the tax cuts would be a major plus for them in the election,"" Valliere said. ""We've seen a lot of Republicans abandoning campaign advertising, bragging about the tax cuts. People, especially the Trump base, feel that the tax cuts were a gift to the very wealthy and the corporations.""
Other pieces of the Republican agenda in Congress have proven unpopular, particularly the 2017 repeal of ""Obamacare"" - the 2010 Affordable Care Act - that set up mandated health insurance markets designed to cut costs and make healthcare more accessible for Americans.
In Illinois, Bost was forced to discontinue holding town hall meetings to avoid irate constituents.
The National Republican Congressional Committee, which is the political arm of the House Republican party, adopted the theme, ""Protecting Our Historic Republican Majority"" in its campaign and fundraising communications. One by one, it is attempting to paint Democrats as ""radical leftists"" opposed to ""conservative values"".
But without a popular national platform, the anti-Trump political climate has left Republicans scrambling to play on local issues or, in some cases, use tricks to weaken the appeal of Democratic opponents.
In Virginia's 7th district, defined by suburbs of the state capital Richmond, Tea Party darling Dave Brat is in a tough fight against Democrat challenger Abigail Spanberger, a former CIA operative whose security clearance application was improperly leaked by a political group tied to Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan.
Ryan's working-class Wisconsin district outside of Milwaukee was carried by Trump 53-42 percent over Clinton in 2016. He announced in April he would not seek re-election, one of 39 House Republicans choosing to retire rather than face voters this year.
""There's where the Achilles heel in the Trump movement is,"" Jackson said.

Major battles have become rarer in Tripoli since last year as a handful of armed factions aligned with the internationally recognised Government of National Accord (GNA) consolidated their control.
But the ascent of four or five ""super militias"" has created resentment among groups excluded from the capital and from access to the spoils of Libya's informal economy.
That has heightened the risk of conflict and made the challenge of disbanding militias or integrating them into regular security forces more complex, diplomats and analysts say.
Bringing armed groups to heel is seen as crucial to resolving a conflict that has divided Libya since a NATO-backed uprising forced Muammar Gaddafi from power seven years ago, slashing oil production and giving space to migrant smugglers and fighters.
Street battles on Monday and Tuesday pitted the Seventh Brigade, or Kaniyat, from Tarhouna, a town 65km southeast of Tripoli, against the Tripoli Revolutionaries' Brigades (TRB) and the Nawasi, two of the capital's largest factions.
The Kaniyat and other groups from outside Tripoli have noticed the success of rivals inside the city with growing unease. Reports about the wealth, power and extravagant lifestyles of some Tripoli rebel commanders have fuelled resentment.
""The profits from state capture now go to a narrower set of armed groups than ever before,"" said Wolfram Lacher, a researcher at the German think-tank SWP.
""That's a very dangerous situation because it excludes powerful forces from access to levers of the state and administration, and this is now causing those forces to build alliances against the big militias in Tripoli.""
As they launched their incursion into Tripoli, Kaniyat denounced their rivals as the ""Daesh [ISIL] of public money"", promising to ""cleanse"" them from the country.
Kaniyat made gains as tanks, armoured vehicles, and pick-up trucks mounted with anti-aircraft guns were deployed in densely populated residential areas of southern Tripoli, with explosions and heavy artillery fire echoing across the city.
At least five people were killed and nearly 30 wounded on the first day, officials said.
Because of the fighting, several hundred migrants are now trapped in government-run detention centres in the capital after guards fled clashes between the rival groups in the past few days.
One aid worker, who asked to remain anonymous, told Reuters news agency about 400 people have been abandoned without food in the Ain Zara detention centre run by the UN-backed government.
Tripoli's big armed groups claim official status through the GNA - which is opposed by a rival government and military faction based in the east of the sprawling North African country - but act with autonomy.
They guard strategic buildings, control Tripoli's airport, and have infiltrated ministries and many of the banks, giving them access to coveted dollars at the official exchange rate, about five times cheaper than the parallel rate.
""They place their people throughout the state administration, particularly in positions that offer control of economic resources,"" said Lacher.
Since last summer an ex-prime minister, the mayor of Tripoli, and the head of the state religious authority have been among a series of senior figures to be abducted then released by rebel fighters.
A key member of the GNA's leadership, Fathi al-Majbari, withdrew from his position after an armed group attacked his residence in June.
Earlier this month the National Oil Corporation denounced threats by militias against the newly appointed head of its fuel distribution unit over efforts to tackle smuggling and the sovereign wealth fund said that it had been forced by threats and abductions to move premises.
Prominent Libyans based abroad have said they seek the protection of armed factions, not the government, when they travel to Tripoli. Diplomatic staff evacuated amid fighting in 2014 and now tentatively returning ultimately depend on armed groups for access and protection.
Critics of a French-led plan to hold national elections on December 10 worry a free vote will be impossible, and militias will challenge with force any result they don't like.
""I think it's a race against time and I feel like the [Libyan] state's disappearing,"" said one senior diplomat. ""It's hard now to tell where's the state and where's the militia.""

Nine days ago, the Diciotti rescued dinghies in distress off the Maltese coast in the Mediterranean. After days of uncertainty at sea, the coastguard vessel was granted permission to dock in the Sicilian port of Catania on Monday.
Of the 177 people on board, only 29 unaccompanied children have been allowed so far by the Italian government to disembark.
Matteo Salvini, Italy's far-right interior minister and co-deputy prime minister, announced earlier in the week he would allow people to leave the ship on the condition that other EU countries agreed to share responsibility for them.
As a result, more than 150 people on board the Diciotti - mostly refugees from Eritrea - sleep on cardboard boxes while waiting for a resolution to the latest European migration standoff.
All eyes on Friday were on an informal meeting of senior European leaders organised by the European Commission to discuss disembarkation amid threats by Italy to pull funding for the European Union unless member states agreed to take people from the Diciotti in.
But the talks ended without producing a solution for the stranded refugees and migrants, some of whom earlier on Friday reportedly started a hunger strike.
""This was not a meeting where decisions were taken"", a Commission spokesperson said in a statement. ""It was a meeting that was organised by the Commission to harvest ideas and contributions to the on-going work to put in place a more predictable, sustainable and cooperative approach on disembarkation and responsibility sharing.""
After the meeting, Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte warned on Facebook that ""Italy will act accordingly"".
""We once again take note of the discrepancy, which borders hypocrisy, between words and action,"" he said.
Matteo Villa, a migration research fellow at the Italian Institute for International Studies, told Al Jazeera that ""no one expected anything different"" from Friday's talks.
""European countries decided it's best to avoid expending a lot of political capital to face Italy's threats.""
The Diciotti is the latest in a string of cases which saw Italy, as well as Malta, refuse or delay the disembarkation of people rescued in the Central Mediterranean, often after spending many months in detention in Libya.
""Either Europe starts being serious defending its borders and relocating the immigrants, or we'll start taking them back to the ports they left from,"" Salvini threatened on a Facebook post.
Recent polls say that popular support for his anti-migration League party has been rising since the new government was installed in early June.
Salvini's communication strategy hasn't changed since becoming minister, revolving around Facebook live videos watched by tens of thousands of people.
Sometimes, his social media statements seemingly replace official announcements, too.
An Italian daily reported that the Diciotti's captain, Massimo Kothmeir, received permission to dock from the transport ministry but only later learned from Salvini's social media accounts that the rescued migrants were not to be allowed off the ship.
Salvini's migrant strategy has been condemned by human rights groups, with Human Rights Watch (HRW) calling for the migrants and refugees to be allowed disembarkation.
""Keeping people hostage is not the right way to ask for more cooperation and solidarity,"" Judith Sunderland, associate director for Europe and Central Asia at HRW, told Al Jazeera.
The United Nations and a host of Italian NGOs also called for the migrants to be let off the ship.
Italy's independent guarantor of the rights of detained people warned that the country was breaching its own constitution as well as the European Convention on Human Rights by depriving people of their liberty without a court order.
Sicily prosecutors have opened probes for kidnapping and abuse of office ""against unknowns"". Salvini defiantly stated he is ""waiting"" to be arrested.
Despite some internal dissent - notably from the President of Italy's Chamber of Deputies Roberto Fico - Salvini is fully supported by the other party in the governing coalition, the Five Star Movement.
The leader of the Five Star Movement and co-deputy Prime Minister Luigi di Maio told reporters on Thursday that should no decision be reached in Friday's meeting, Italy should stop paying into the EU budget.
On Friday, he reiterated that he was ""ready to reduce the funds that we give to the European Union"" in a Facebook post.
Italy, whose public debt amounts to 130 percent of its gross domestic product (GDP), is expected to approve its 2019 budget in the coming weeks.
Since Italy adopted a hard stance on sea rescues, standoffs on disembarkation to Italian and Maltese ports have been resolved with ad-hoc agreements.
In July, several European countries promised to relocate 270 out of more than 400 migrants and refugees that had arrived in the Sicilian port of Pozzallo.
In the days following the deal, Conte said the EU was finally hearing Italy's arguments on migration, accepting ""the principle that immigration is a European challenge"".
However, as Salvini himself has admitted, only France has so far kept its promise, relocating 47.
The others, who were supposed to depart to Germany, Portugal, Spain, Ireland and Malta are presumed to be still waiting at Pozzallo.
At a June summit, EU leaders agreed on a range of measures including the establishment of asylum ""processing centres"" both inside the EU and in transit countries.
Arrivals to Italy - and to Europe overall - more than halved in 2017 to just over 172,300. More than 3,000 people died or went missing in the same year.
In February 2017, the previous Italian administration signed a memorandum of understanding on migration with Libya's Government of National Accord.
With EU approval, Italy began training and equipping Libya's coastguard to perform rescues, ""pulling back"" migrant boats.
While arrivals via the central Mediterranean route have continued to decrease, the western route from Morocco to Spain has seen a significant increase and currently records the highest numbers.
Still, the mortality rate has increased in the central Mediterranean.
""The number of arrivals is very low compared with previous years,"" Sunderland, of HRW, told Al Jazeera.
""We are talking about a manageable number. There's no emergency, let alone an invasion. It is true that over the years the issue of the lack of equal distribution of asylum seekers within Europe has created divisions and tensions.
""At this stage, it has become the main obstacle to any kind of reasonable and rational policy on migration,"" Sunderland said, adding that ""there is certainly a need for a clear and long-term agreement among European countries to avoid this situation"".
According to Carlo Ruzza, professor of political sociology at the University of Trento who studies populist movements and anti-populism, whether or not the strategy has achieved its own purpose is less important than the consensus it gathers.
""Objectively nothing has changed much,"" Ruzza told Al Jazeera.
""What is important is creating a sense of opposition towards an external enemy, the European Union, which makes us feel like a large community, reinforcing the idea we are persecuted and helping us trust a charismatic leader, the only one able to fight this enemy.""
""The problem is that [leaders] are not really dialoguing with Europe,"" Ruzza concluded.
""They are speaking with the Italian electorate.""

Authorities in Saxony confirmed on Wednesday that the police employee had attended a march by anti-Islam and anti-migrant group PEGIDA in the state capital, Dresden, on August 18 and had reported journalists covering the rally to police, who detained them for 45 minutes.
Video footage showed a well-built man in sunglasses and a hat in the colours of the German flag confronting the crew working for public broadcaster ZDF, waving his hands at the camera, telling them not to film and reporting them to the police.
The ZDF reporter, Arndt Ginzel, accused police of effectively acting as the ""executive"" arm of PEGIDA.

The incident took place at a rally against a visit to Dresden by German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
But Merkel's conservatives also faced accusations of ignoring the rise of far-right groups in Saxony, after state premier Michael Kretschmer, a senior member of the chancellor's Christian Democratic Union (CDU), appeared to defend the police action, writing on Twitter: ""The only people who come across seriously in this video are policemen.""
A deputy leader of the Social Democrats (SPD), who share power with the CDU in the federal German government, accused Merkel's party of complacency about the growth of the far-right.
""The CDU in Saxony has for decades denied or trivialised right-wing radical movements and violence,"" Ralf Stegner told Handelsblatt daily.
It has ""allowed right-wing thinking in Saxony not only to go unchallenged but also to be acceptable"", he said.
German Justice Minister Katarina Barley, also from the SPD, said the events were ""very worrying"" and had to be quickly and comprehensively cleared up.
""Press freedom is an important part of our society and our constitution,"" she said.
Kretschmer has since said he is a convinced defender of a free press and Die Welt newspaper quoted him on Thursday as saying, ""I am intent on assessing the situation calmly and in a factual manner"".
Cornelia Hass, chief executive of the DJV union representing journalists, urged Germany's federal and state security officials to review the way police are trained in their dealings with reporters.
""Safeguarding press freedom needs to be a major element in the training of security forces,"" she said.
Journalists covering demonstrations by PEGIDA are regularly spat at, verbally abused and threatened by protesters with little police intervention.
Merkel's decision in 2015 to let in about one million refugees and migrants, many fleeing wars in the Middle East, has fuelled support for far-right groups such as PEGIDA and the Alternative for Germany (AfD), now the main opposition party in parliament.
Saxony, the cradle of the PEGIDA movement, is a stronghold for far-right sentiment. In last year's federal election, the AfD was the strongest party in the state, pushing Merkel's CDU into second place.
Kretschmer, who has criticised Merkel's migration policy, faces a tough challenge in next year's state election to hold Saxony for the CDU.
Neo-Nazis have a strong tradition in Saxony, especially in Dresden, where they gather every year on February 13 to mark the Allied firebombing of the city in World War II which killed 25,000 people and destroyed its baroque architecture.
Asked by broadcaster NDR about the off-duty police employee taking part in a PEGIDA rally, a Saxony police spokesman did not deny there might be supporters of the group in police ranks.
""The police is a cross-section of society. We have all political views,"" he said.

Cyprus Justice Minister Ionas Nicolaou told The Associated Press news agency (AP) that Seif el-Din Mustafa was transferred to Egyptian custody and flown back to Cairo on Saturday where prosecutors were investigating the incident.
Nicolaou said the extradition went ahead after Mustafa dropped a three-year court battle to avoid extradition.
The 61-year-old had previously challenged extradition on the grounds that he could face torture or an unfair trial in Egypt.
He hijacked the flight - an EgyptAir domestic flight from Alexandria to Cairo - in March 2016, using a fake suicide belt.
He surrendered to Cypriot authorities nearly six hours after landing, having gradually released all 72 passengers and crew unharmed.
A member of the cabin crew and a passenger by the name of Ben Innes even took a photo with Mustafa, which was later posted on social media.
Mustafa told a Cypriot court that he didn't mean to harm anyone and was trying to help secure the release of 63 female dissidents being held in Egyptian prisons and expose what he called the ""fascist regime"" of Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sisi.
But prosecutors said Mustafa admitted in a written statement to police that he only carried out the hijacking in order to be reunited with his Cypriot family, from whom he had been estranged for 24 years.
Mustafa dismissed the written statement as ""purposeful misinformation"" by the Cypriot and Egyptian governments put out to discredit him.
Doros Polycarpou, with the migrant support group KISA that assisted Mustafa, told AP that the Mustafa decided of his own accord to return to Egypt and face prosecution there, despite fears that he may be tortured.
Egypt and Cyprus have a 1996 extradition treaty.
Polycarpou said Mustafa told his legal team he was willing ""to take the risk"" of suffering mistreatment at the hands of Egyptian authorities because he could ""no longer take"" his holding conditions in Cyprus' prison complex.
He said Mustafa had complained that he was being held in ""isolation"" and put under ""psychological strain"" because authorities kept him away from the prison's general population.
Last year, the European Court of Human Rights blocked Cyprus from extraditing Mustafa until it could rule on whether doing so would violate its prohibition on returning individuals to countries where they may face torture or inhumane treatment.

Italian news agency ANSA reported on Monday that the accident took place on a state highway in the area of Lesina in the province of Foggia.
Pictures from the scene showed a white minivan flipped on its roof and lying in the middle of the road following a head-on collision with a truck carrying flour.
Citing police sources, ANSA said 12 people were killed in the crash, adding that at least some of the victims were migrant farm workers who were travelling in the van. Three people, including the truck driver, were injured in the crash.
AFP news agency quoted the fire service as saying that all the victims came from North Africa.
The accident happened two days after four African migrants died in a similar crash in the same region.

Thousands of migrants work in the Italian agriculture sector, harvesting fruit and vegetables.
Although most of them have regular papers, they live in squalid conditions and suffer tough working conditions and low pay.
Local reports said that Fai Cisl, an agricultural trade union, was investigating whether these were avoidable tragedies.
""We want to know if someone is responsible, if the deaths were an avoidable tragedy,"" the union said on August 4, after the first accident.
""And if the transport was regulated, or if the workers were crammed into the van as still happens, unfortunately, very often,"" they added.
Flavio Di Giacomo, a spokesman for the International Organization for Migration, also expressed concern on Monday, writing on Twitter that ""in Italy, thousands of migrants work in black labour market, often exploited in the fields"".
Separately, at two least people were killed also on Monday when a tanker truck caught fire and on a major highway in Bologna, northern Italy.

In an attempt to increase the number of parents and children that are reunited, the judge on Friday ordered the government to appoint a person to take charge of its efforts.
""This is going to be a significant undertaking and it's clear there has to be one person in charge,"" Judge Dana Sabraw said at a hearing in San Diego. ""The reality is that for every parent who is not located, there will be a permanent orphaned child.""
Sabraw is the judge who ordered the government to reunite about 2,500 separated children with their parents by July 26. About 1,900 of those children have been reconnected with family members so far, but hundreds remain incarcerated.
Trump administration attorneys filed an unusual request in a district court in southern California, arguing the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and other non-profits and charities should carry the burden of finding the 410 deported migrant parents.
Sabraw, however, struck down that idea saying it was ""100 percent the responsibility of the administration"".
""Many of these parents were removed from the country without their child; all of this is the result of the government's separation and then, inability and failure to track and reunite,"" the judge said.
The parents and children were separated as part of President Donald Trump's ""zero tolerance"" policy towards undocumented immigration, sparking global outrage as images and recordings of weeping children emerged.
""The judge is refusing to let the government off the hook for the mess it made,"" said lawyer Lee Gelernt of the ACLU, which sued the government over the separations.
Gelernt also accused Washington of holding back information that could help locate the deported parents. ""Every day the government has sat on this information has been another day of suffering for these families,"" he said.
DACA decision
In a different case, a court ordered the Trump's administration on Friday to fully reinstate the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, programme.
Passed by the Obama administration in 2012, DACA shields from deportation about 800,000 undocumented immigrants - known as Dreamers - who were brought to the US as children.
US District Judge John Bates in Washington, DC, first issued a ruling in April ordering the government to continue the programme, adding he would stay the decision for 90 days so it could make its case for why it should be ended.
Following the government's arguments, Bates decided not to change his ruling. He gave the administration until August 23 to appeal.
Trump has railed time and again against the DACA programme, calling on Congress to pass legislation to address the fate of the Dreamers.
Trump promised to end DACA during his 2016 election campaign and the protections were set to begin to be phased out in early March.

In a tweet late on Friday, Trump questioned the intelligence of the three-time NBA champion, following an interview on CNN with host Don Lemon, in which James criticised the Republican president for ""dividing the sport"".
""Lebron James was just interviewed by the dumbest man on television, Don Lemon. He made Lebron look smart, which isn't easy to do,"" Trump said.
""I like Mike!"" he added, referring to NBA legend Michael Jordan, who along with James is widely considered as one of the greatest basketball players ever.
Lebron James was just interviewed by the dumbest man on television, Don Lemon. He made Lebron look smart, which isn’t easy to do. I like Mike!
In the wide-ranging one-on-one interview which was first aired on Monday with a repeat broadcast on Friday, Lemon asked James: ""What would you say to the [US] president if he was sitting right here?""
""I would never sit across from him,"" the four-time MVP replied, before adding: ""I'd sit across from Barack [Obama], though.""
James, who signed recently for the Los Angeles Lakers, was being interviewed about a school he recently opened for underprivileged children in his hometown of Akron, Ohio, among other topics.
Reacting to Trump's tweet, fellow athletes, sports writers and fans jumped to James' defence and criticised the US president, while Jordan also offered his support.
""I support LeBron James,"" Jordan said in a statement to the Associated Press news agency on Saturday. ""He's doing an amazing job for his community.""
American football Hall of Famer Shannon Sharpe tweeted: ""It should be beneath the dignity of a sitting US president to take racist shots at Don Lemon and LeBron James.""
It should be beneath the dignity of a sitting POTUS to take racist shots at D. Lemon and Lebron James. While only uttering kind words for ruthless dictators, Putin, Kim and Duterte. President Trump, we cape up for ours , “BELIEVE THAT” #KinOrSkinWeRide
Completely inappropriate for the #POTUS to behave like a small child and bully. I don’t care if the he responding to someone who literally calls him names every day. Our president should be above such things. Yet another reason why #Trump is unfit for office.
NBA player Karl-Anthony Towns, who plays for the Minnesota Timberwolves, questioned Trump's priorities.
""So let me get this straight: Flint, Missouri, has dirty water still, but you worried about an interview about a man doing good for education and generations of kids in his hometown?"" he asked the president on Twitter.
So let me get this straight: Flint, MI has dirty water still, but you worried about an interview about a man doing good for education and generations of kids in his hometown? Shut your damn mouth! Stop using them twitter fingers and get stuff done for our country with that pen. https://t.co/sEkX3OKaJM
Many also drew a comparison between James' new school for at-risk children and the defunct Trump University, a for-profit educational institution, which was shut down following multiple lawsuits.
#LebronJames invested over $100 million to send students to a university. Donald Trump had to pay $25 million for ripping off university students. Lebron puts kids in school. Trump puts them in cages.
One of these guys opened an all expenses paid school for children...One of these guys opened a school and was sued by his students...Which one of these guys do you stand with?? #LabronJames
// <![CDATA[

Others took aim at Trump's controversial immigration policy separating migrant children from their detained families, which saw many minors reportedly held in cages at border facilities.
#LeBron puts children through school and is a positive force in this country. #Trump puts children in cages and rips them from their parents.
CNN anchor Lemon also chimed into the Twitter debate, saying: ""Who's the real dummy? A man who puts kids in classrooms or one who puts kids in cages?""
Since taking office, Trump has clashed with several US sports stars, most notably after he called on the National Football League (NFL) owners to fire players who protest during the national anthem.
During a speech in Alabama in September last year, Trump said: ""Wouldn't you love to see one of these NFL owners, when somebody disrespects our flag, you'd say, 'Get that son of a b**** off the field right now. Out! He's fired'.""
Trump rescinded a White House invitation to basketball star Stephen Curry, who had said he would ""vote"" against the planned visit by the NBA champion Golden State Warriors.
At the time, James came to Curry's defence.
U bum @StephenCurry30 already said he ain't going! So therefore ain't no invite. Going to White House was a great honor until you showed up!
""Going to White House was a great honour until you showed up!"" James said on Twitter.

Wildfires had gripped the coastal village of Mati, and people were desperately wading into the sea to escape.
""Come quick,"" said Kostas, his boss.
The 46-year-old Egyptian fisherman rushed out of his home and climbed onto his bicycle.
He could see plumes of smoke shifting above the far-off shores, and pedalled as fast as he could.
Within moments, he arrived at the port in Nea Makri, where they dock their fishing vessel. They set sail.
""We heard that 150 people were trapped between the fire and the sea,"" he tells Al Jazeera.
Forceful waves swayed the boat. The wind carried the thick black smog out to sea, but they carried on, coughing more and more the closer they got to Mati's shores.
Red rescue helicopters hovered above.
Mahmoud al-Sayed Mousa, Egyptian fisherman
He filmed much of it on his mobile phone, posting live video clips on his Facebook feed. One showed the white fishing boat speeding in the direction of the smoke.
""We are going to save the people [fleeing] the fire,"" Mousa says in the clip.
Debris was scattered in the water below. Kostas and Mousa reached a dense cloud that blocked their view of the flame-engulfed village in the distance.
""You couldn't see in front of you, and you couldn't breathe,"" he recalls.
""It was the hardest moment,"" he says, resting his work-scarred hands on his lap. Tears well in his tired eyes. ""If we entered the smoke, we could die. If we didn't enter, the people wouldn't be saved.""
News of scattered wildfires was trickling in. Some spread in Kineta, and others popped up on the outskirts of Rafina, the port town adjacent to Mati, among other areas.
By early evening, Mati, a popular vacation destination for Greeks and tourists, was an inferno. Flames lashed the village, coiling around homes and vehicles.
With the fire encroaching, frantic people poured out of their homes to escape.
Many were unable to find a route out of the village and were forced to abandon their vehicles in the streets and head for the sea. Little by little, reports of deaths emerged.
Mousa is one of thousands of Egyptian fishermen in Greece.
He was 16 years old when he left his hometown Ezbet El Borg, a northern coastal city with a large fishing industry.
In his 30 years here, he says he has never witnessed anything as frightening as the wildfires.
Back on the boat, the smell of burned wood overwhelmed Mousa. Through the hazy fog, he heard the muffled cries of women and children.
He covered his mouth and nose with a cloth to try and limit the fumes he was inhaling.
They steered the boat into the dark, unsure of what to expect.
""We either bring them back with us or we die with them, God willing,"" Mousa told Kostas.
Naim Elghandour, Egyptian-born president of the Muslim Association of Greece
As the sound of people pleading for help grew closer, Mousa knotted a rope and flung it into the sea. Someone grabbed on. He pulled a man in and lifted him up onto the vessel.
Daylight was fading as the sun dipped behind the hills. They scoured the waters around them, locating and pulling up each person they found.
""We scooped them up like when we're fishing,"" Mousa remembers. ""People were crying and shaking while they hugged us.""
By the time it was over, they had saved 23 Greeks and four dogs, he estimates.
Mousa and Kostas brought the survivors back to dry land in Nea Marki.
""It was nothing,"" Mousa told the grateful survivors.
The efforts of rescue teams, the coastguard and others resulted in upwards of 700 people being saved.
At least 91 people died; they either burned alive, drowned or succumbed to smoke inhalation.
Twenty-six bodies, among them children, were found the next day huddled together near a steep cliff overlooking the jagged coastline.
""They had tried to find an escape route, but unfortunately these people and their kids didn't make it in time,"" Nikos Economopoulos, the head of Greece's Red Cross, told the local Skai TV last Tuesday. ""Instinctively, seeing the end nearing, they embraced.""
Greek authorities say 25 people are still missing.
More than 1,000 homes were destroyed.
The wildfires scorched 6,879 hectares of forest and residential land.
Several other Egyptian fishermen answered the coastguard's call for assistance, and Pakistani and Afghan migrant groups sent volunteers to Mati to help in the cleanup effort.
Naim Elghandour, the Egyptian-born president of the Muslim Association of Greece, describes the efforts of Muslim refugees and migrants during the fires and after as ""heroic"".
""In the past, Egyptian fishermen were victims of racist violence by the criminal party Golden Dawn,"" he tells Al Jazeera, referring to the neo-fascist party with 16 seats in the Hellenic Parliament.
""But humanity doesn't differentiate between nationalities, and there is no difference between Greeks and Egyptians.""
Although rattled by the tragedy, Mousa says: ""I'm happy I was part of the reason those people were saved … It was our duty to help.""

In a proposal published on Tuesday, the commission said it would pay 6,000 euros ($7,010) for each migrant taken in by EU member states, as well as funding the cost of hundreds of personnel to process mostly African migrants seeking asylum in Europe.
Italy's Interior Minister Matteo Salvini denounced the offer as far too little.
""We aren't asking for charity handouts. Every asylum seeker costs the Italian taxpayer between 40,000 and 50,000 euros ($46,700 and $58,400). Brussels, they can keep their charity for themselves,"" Salvini told reporters. ""We don't want money. We want dignity.""
The commission's plan, which is aimed at EU governments that set up processing centres on their soil, follows a June leaders' summit that claimed success in reaching a hard-fought agreement to control immigration but left many details unresolved.
Undocumented migration has fallen steeply since 2015 when more than one million people entered the EU, but polls show it is still a top concern for many of the union's 500 million citizens.
The governments of Italy and Germany are under heavy pressure at home to ensure fewer migrants come to their territory from across the Mediterranean Sea, while Eastern European leaders are bitterly opposed to taking them in.
Italy has shut its ports to humanitarian rescue ships, saying it is bearing an unfair burden of asylum seekers.
By publishing its proposals, Natasha Berthaud, a European Commission spokeswoman, said it was seeking ""a truly shared regional responsibility in responding to complex migration challenges"", although governments have yet to come forward to host new processing centres.
EU envoys are expected to discuss the proposal on Wednesday, with another meeting planned in Geneva on July 30.
Now more than ever we need common, European solutions on #migrationEU. We are ready to support Member States and third countries in better cooperating on disembarkation of those rescued at sea.

The Spanish NGO, which carries out search and rescue operations in Mediterranean, posted a video and pictures on Twitter showing how their boat took on board three people; two women and a child.
By the time the three were found by Proactiva, one woman and the child had already died.
According to tweets by Oscar Camps, founder and director of Proactiva, the boat was damaged and abandoned by the Libyan coastguard.
""Today we’ve found the bodies of a woman and a small child, as well as a woman who was still alive among the wreck of a ship,"" Camps said in a video.
""I want to condemn the lack of assistance in international waters and the merchant ship Triades which abandoned a boat in danger in the middle of the night,"" he added.
""They don’t know how to manage an emergency situation they arrived two days late and abandoned two women and a child in the wreckage of a ship that they themselves destroyed,"" Camps said.
The boat carrying the two bodies and one survivor were found about 120km off the Libyan coast.

""This is the direct consequence of contracting armed militias to make the rest of Europe believe that Libya is a state, a government and a safe country,"" Camps said, referring to deals made between Libya and European countries in an attempt to stem the number of refugees trying to reach Europe.
Libya, one of the main departing points for refugees traveling from North Africa to Europe, has made deals with Europe.
Later, Camps blamed the death of the refugees on Italy and its new interior minister, Matteo Salvini.
""This is the direct consequence of not allowing the work of NGOs that save lives in the Mediterranean,"" Camps said.

Since taking up his post in early June, Salvini has pushed the divisive issue of migration to the forefront of the EU agenda by refusing to open Italy's ports to migrant rescue ships operating in the Mediterranean.
Last week, Salvini vowed to end arrivals by boat completely, saying the aim of the new policies was that ""not one more person arrives by boat"" on Italian shores.
He has accused the NGO ships of aiding human traffickers to bring migrants to Europe.
""Since we made our position known, in recent hours, there has not been a single ship of these so-called 'humanitarian associations' in Libyan waters,"" Salvini said.
""Pregnant women, children and refugees will remain in Italy,"" said the minister, who has promised to speed up deportations of undocumented immigrants.
""Protection is reserved for humanitarian cases,"" he added.
Italy's new, stricter polices have led to condemnation from several NGOs, but also from countries like Spain and France.
