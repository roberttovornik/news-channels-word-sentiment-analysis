Portraits challenge negative stereotypes around refugees ","A new photographic exhibition features portraits of 10 refugees now living in the UK. They describe the lives they have left behind, the challenges they have faced here and their dreams for the future
They hail from all corners of the world, with wildly different stories, but they share a common passion: to challenge the pessimistic stereotypes that are often associated with refugees in the UK.
From a gay man from Egypt who sought personal freedom in Britain to a Yemeni human rights advocate displaced by war, 10 refugees are featured in total. A New Beginning is organised by refugee employment charity Breaking Barriers and is on display at Protein Studios in Shoreditch, London, from tomorrow (4 October) until 7 October.
“At times, the images and stories describe harrowing journeys and challenging circumstances, but also show startling human resilience, and the hope and optimism that can emerge from personal connections,” said Matthew Powell, founder and CEO of Breaking Barriers.
Each refugee was interviewed by journalist Samira Shackle before having his or her portrait taken by photographers, from documentary to fashion specialists. The subjects also include a Kurdish political activist who was forced to flee Turkey after being handed a jail sentence in childhood, a teenager who Eritrea who made the dangerous and illegal overland journey to Britain, and a Syrian family who arrived in the UK on an official resettlement programme – without speaking a word of English.
The exhibition was co-curated by Rebecca McClelland.
Below are stories from three of the people featured in A New Beginning.
“I was born and raised in Eritrea. I did military service and was working in the capital, but the situation in my country is difficult. There isn’t much possibility of pursuing your dreams. We had some problems, so I left. First I went to Sudan, then to Uganda to process my visa application, and in January 2017 I flew to London.
We learn the English language in schools back home, but other than that we don’t have much access to British culture – all the movies and TV we consume are American. I wanted to get to know how everything works. I learned that people say “please” and “thank you” a lot more than we do back home.
Starting from the beginning, I had someone to pick me up from the airport, so it was easier to settle. I had a network of support here. My aunt and uncle have lived in London more than 40 years. Their kids – my cousins – were born and raised here. It gave me an insight into life in the UK. The first thing I wanted to know was about the laws. I was a law-abiding citizen in Eritrea, and I was determined to be the same here.

It might seem like my story is easy, but it’s hard to adjust to a totally new place, in ways that I can’t even describe. I tried so hard to get a job, but it was difficult. The first question in interviews was always “what is your experience in the UK?” But this is my first time in the UK, so my experience is back home. There’s no way to prove that. I understand why employers ask those questions, but it’s frustrating too.
Yonathan, one of my close friends from Eritrea, had come to the UK about nine months before me. We’ve known each other since we were teenagers. Whenever I have anything on my mind, I can discuss it with him. He has helped me with all the small things that seem like they should be easy but aren’t. He introduced me to Breaking Barriers, who helped me to find a job at Ikea. It’s a full-time job, and I’ve been promoted to being a kitchen planner, so I have some stability in my life.
I still miss Eritrea. My parents are there, and one sister is married and settled there. My brother is in the US and my other sister is in Germany, so we are scattered all over the world. Back home, I had a part-time job at weekends – I used to DJ. It’s a real passion of mine. I love all different types of music, and I think I have good taste. But producing music isn’t a popular occupation in Eritrea. I think now that I’m here, I’d like to go back to school and study music production and get really good at it.”
“It is warm in Sudan. There’s sun all the time, but I don’t only mean the weather. The people are warm too – family, friends, everyone helps each other. But from when I was young, I felt that something was not right. I noticed some laws were restrictive. I wanted to change the rules that place so much pressure on people, particularly women. That’s why I decided to study law.
The first time I came to the UK was to do my master’s: human rights and humanitarian law at Essex University. After that, I went back to Sudan. It’s difficult for people who work in the human rights field in Sudan – even if you say something on Twitter or Facebook you can be detained. Around three years ago, I had to leave the country. I came back to the UK, this time to apply for refugee status. I knew the theory of the law – that you have the right to seek protection – and then I saw the practice. The uncertainty is awful, and you aren’t allowed to volunteer or work while you’re waiting. In the end, it took six months to get my papers. Then I was free to go and work and do everything. Everything is different here to Sudan, so it was a bit of collision.

“When I moved to London, I thought it was just so big. But I liked it straight away, because you see so many different people and so many languages are spoken. You don’t feel like you are a foreigner, because everyone is from somewhere else. But it’s so expensive, and it costs money even to travel to job interviews or to dress in a certain way. I wanted London to be my home, and I couldn’t feel at home unless I was active and contributing to society, living and working. I was applying for jobs all the time and volunteering. So I was busy – but I was stuck in a circle. I couldn’t find a job that paid the bills and was in line with my interests and expertise.
Through Breaking Barriers, I was offered work experience at the law firm Mishcon de Reya. I took a gamble and I left my job to do the work experience. Soon after that, I got a paid job as a personal assistant, and now I am a legal administrator.
At first, everything felt so difficult – it was a new environment and the work wasn’t easy. I met Anthony Julius on the first day I came to Mishcon. He was so welcoming and nice. He said: “You’re welcome here”. After a few months, I felt I wasn’t moving forward and that in such a big firm, I would never be able to progress. I met with Anthony and told him that I didn’t know how to navigate the system, and was thinking of returning to the charity sector. He told me not to give up on my legal career. He said that refugees have got the resilience, and that I could make it. He arranged for me to have a mentor within the firm. My mentor has given me so much encouragement. Now I’m on the immigration team, and I have another mentor who is so supportive. This is an area of law I’d like to continue to work in. Anthony and my other colleagues at Mishcon know that people can learn if they just give them the right environment.
There’s a quote that I like by Albert Schweitzer: “Sometimes our light goes out, but it’s blown into flame by another human being. Each of us owes deepest thanks to those who have rekindled this light.””
“At a certain point, I realised that if I wanted to be who I am, my life in Egypt couldn’t continue. Either I could surrender everything and become like an animal, or I had to leave. We have this concept in Egypt that the social, political and religious are connected, and you must conform on all three counts. I visited the UK in November 2016, and planned to go back to Cairo afterwards. But in my first week I asked myself: why are you going back, unless you want to die? I took the decision suddenly and applied for asylum, without thinking twice. If you feel you are dying anyway, the consequences don’t matter.
I had visited the UK four or five times before because I worked for an international company. Every time I came, I thought: “I want to live here, it’s the best country in the whole world.” But when you live here it’s totally different – you start to discover the things you’re not used to. I came here longing for human connection, but I realised quickly this was not going to be easy.
Compared with Egyptians, English people are reserved, with a lot of guards and barriers. Plus, I have a really close relationship with my parents. Before I left Egypt, I didn’t know that I wasn’t coming back, so I didn’t say goodbye. For the first six months or so, I was very depressed and cried all the time. My mum told me not to give up and reminded me how restricted I was in Cairo. She is always the one who keeps me going.

“Through the Compass Project, which helps asylum seekers go to university, I have nearly completed a masters in finance at Birkbeck University. A mentor there told me about Breaking Barriers. They helped me to find an internship at BAMM, a creative research agency. I had struggled to find work – I’d done maybe 20 interviews at that point and never got anything, so I was delighted when they accepted me. That’s where I met Momo. I was so nervous about starting work in the UK.
The culture is different and I didn’t know how to behave. But on my first day, Momo treated me like I had worked there for years. Whenever I was scared or embarrassed, she supported and encouraged me. We went out after work every day, and even after I finished the internship we continued to be really close friends. She taught me so much about business, and she taught me another thing too: you don’t have to be embarrassed about your background. You can use your culture in your work, in your life, and you shouldn’t be ashamed.
I volunteered at Pride’s pop up shop last year. Through that I met a community of Arabs involved in the LGBT community, which has been wonderful. Now we are all friends and I have parties at my house. And I’ve got a new job at WeWork. The only thing I ever wanted from my life was to be in peace – not even to be happy, just to be content. Even now that I don’t have restrictions outside, I have restrictions inside myself. I find myself thinking twice about what I can wear – I suppose it’s just what I’ve grown up with. But in Egypt, I had reached the point where it was hard for me to go to the supermarket. Now I can walk the streets. Even when circumstances in my life are hard, I keep thinking: you have to be thankful.”

https://www.positive.news/society/its-a-match-website-offers-academic-refugees-a-lifeline/,refugee,523,"August 31, 2018",Suzanne Bearne,It’s a match! Website offers academic refugees a lifeline,"When Germany opened its borders during the worst refugee crisis in recent years, one woman felt compelled to help people who had left behind high-flying careers in academia
“I knew there must be people coming here who were scientists, and how horrible it must be if you were once using your brain for something, working all day on a subject, and now just sit around,” says Dr Carmen Bachmann, professor of business taxation at Leipzig University.
It was 2015 and Germany was facing a fourfold increase in the number of asylum applications compared to the previous year. People were fleeing war, violence and poverty in Asia, Africa and the Middle East: the largest influx in the country’s post-war history.
Bachmann decided to build a website to help academics who had had to flee their countries, connect with their German peers. Using a template of a dating site, Chance for Science encourages users to enter a profile and their location and area of study, which results in relevant ‘matches’. These can be collaboration or research opportunities, or simply ideas sharing. “I saw this as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity,” says Bachmann.
The site now has more than 700 users, including at least 200 refugees, but Bachmann says it was a challenge to get refugees on board when it launched in September 2015. To attract users, she visited refugee camps and handed out flyers. She remembers the first academic she met at a refugee camp in Leipzig. “It was an emotional connection, as he had left everything apart from his diploma in engineering. He was happy that someone saw him as an academic and not only a refugee. Studying something like that, you think of your personality as part of it.”
He was happy that someone recognised him as an academic and not just a refugee
While Chance for Science wasn’t solely set up to help refugees find jobs – more so the exchange of ideas with their German counterparts – Bachmann is enthused by the success of the site. “I know some examples of where refugees have met German professors and they applied for scholarships and now successfully work together. It feels good to have made that contribution via the website.”
Bachmann herself is currently teamed up with Günay Karli, an academic in computer science who had to flee Turkey. “He has helped me with a presentation that’s focused on using big data in business,” she says. “He feels like he’s being useful, rather than just sitting around.”
As well as connecting asylum seekers and refugees with fellow academics, the website has also led to scholarships and research collaborations
Chance for Science is run by Bachmann and a team of volunteers, but last year the professor received funding from the state of Saxony to host a series of educational workshops designed to help refugees understand the academic system.
More than two years since the website’s launch, Bachmann says she feels heartened by her fellow academics’ kindness. “When I started, so many German professors wanted to join in. Now that it’s happening, it’s giving them the chance to do something meaningful in their field.”

https://www.positive.news/society/why-should-refugee-craftspeople-abandon-their-skills-when-fleeing/,refugee,416,"August 23, 2018",Sam Kearney,Why should refugee craftspeople abandon their skills when fleeing?,"‘Within each piece lies a story of history and culture,’ says Filippo Grandi, UN high commissioner for refugees
It’s one of the less-discussed impacts of the global refugee crisis: the loss of craft talent and tradition. An estimated 22.5 million refugees are currently away from their homes, displaced around the world by war, persecution and natural disaster. Not only must refugee craftspeople abandon their skills and livelihoods to adapt to life in new countries, but indigenous techniques and processes themselves may be threatened.
The Made51 project wants to help. Initiated by the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) and supported by a global network of local social enterprises, Made51 gives makers a way to market their crafts worldwide by linking them with established supply chains.
“Refugees have skills and talents that only need a chance to grow and flourish,” says Filippo Grandi, UN high commissioner for refugees. “Within each piece lies a story of history and culture, and the opportunity for a person who has fled war and persecution to offer something of beauty to the world.”

Featuring 12 products so far, the project’s debut collection launched at a trade fair in Frankfurt in February. It includes intricate basketry by Burundian refugees living in camps in Tanzania, and Burmese artisans in Thailand who have adapted traditional bamboo-weaving techniques to make modern lampshades. Whether based in Jordan, Thailand, Rwanda or Afghanistan, makers are paid a fair wage, say those behind the project. Products are listed online at made51.org, each accompanied by facts and figures about its maker or makers.
“These products are not just beautifully crafted objects – they are artefacts from endangered cultures,” says Heidi Christ, artisan value chain expert at UNHCR.

The collection also includes hand-knotted pile rugs made using a traditional technique by 57 refugee Afghan artisans from Arzy Studio Hope. From Jordan, Syrian refugees contributed cashmere throws and bags, made using traditional crochet and embroidery techniques.

“By including the collection in their sourcing plans, retailers and brands have a vital role in helping refugees to achieve self-reliance,” says Grandi. “Retailers and brands can be part of the solution to this global crisis.”

https://www.positive.news/society/displaced-dignified-determined-highly-skilled-refugees/,refugee,837,"May 22, 2018",None,"Displaced, dignified, determined: highly skilled refugees","In a Kenyan camp for displaced people, Congolese refugees who were doctors and lawyers at home are putting their skills to good use
We meet four among the thousands of Congolese people living in Kakuma refugee camp, a vast expanse of huts and tents in the arid plains of north-western Kenya. Before conflict interrupted life as they knew it, these refugees were doctors, lawyers and peacebuilders. Despite living in extremely challenging conditions, they are using their expertise to help others.
“I’ve known the importance of education since I was a child. It’s the only thing that can change your life”
Why am I here? Because I like to read newspapers. There is a lot of suspicion of educated people in Congo but I’ve known the importance of education since I was a child. It’s the only thing that can change your life.
I’ve been in Kakuma since 2012 and came here from the Katanga province, in Congo. I was separated from my parents in 2006 and I still don’t know where they are, but I believe that they are alive. Back in Congo I studied international relations so that I could defend the interests of my country and represent it internationally. But then the conflict began.
The worst thing that can happen in the camp? That you lose hope. You always have to remember your goals. Even though I can’t apply everything I’ve learned here, I try to do what I can. Along with some friends, we created a library which everyone can use. We came up with the Solidarity Initiative for Refugees, a programme that helps people get their bachelor’s degree. They always say that in the camp you cannot get a degree, but we changed that.”
“I don’t do it for the money. I want to help people who are sick”
When I was in Congo, I was a tailor first. I like to make clothing and to be creative. But I changed to nursing so I could take care of sick people. I studied in the capital, Kinshasa, where life was very good. But my father was a lawyer and, because of his work, things weren’t safe for us there.
One night, people came to take him and my mother. They still haven’t been found. I fled and came here with my young brother in 2013. Life at the beginning was very hard. I couldn’t find a job and had no money. It was very stressful; just waiting for food from the UN and nothing else.
After three months, I found a volunteer position, and now work full-time as a nurse here in a clinic. But I don’t do it for the money. I want to help people who are sick, and I want to look to my future.”
“We are the ones living this life – we understand the challenges”
After seeing how conflict affected people in Congo, I decided to study peace and development. After getting my bachelor’s degree I worked as a field coordinator, resolving conflict between two tribes in the South Kivu province. Then I worked with a Norwegian organisation, returning child soldiers to their homes so they could go to school.
But the soldiers saw me taking away their child soldiers and my tribe saw that I was talking to the other side, so everyone considered me an enemy. I escaped to Rwanda, travelled to Uganda and then I came here. When I arrived, I worked as a community counsellor to help other new arrivals.
I also founded an organisation in which fellow refugees who are doctors teach healthcare skills, so people can look after each other. Psychologically, we’re suffering. But we can still create these organisations to help our fellow refugees. We are the ones living this life – we understand the challenges.”
“I saw a lot of injustice where I was living, and I’m proud to defend people”
I’m a nun and in Congo I was a lawyer by profession. This is my vocation; I saw a lot of injustice where I was living, and I’m proud to defend people. There were those who had been arbitrarily arrested who were released because I protected them.
I was teaching two courses at the university, one about civil rights and another about rights and conflict resolution, because I wanted young people to be able to defend their rights. I also visited prisons, teaching prisoners how to farm and praying with them. I am here because I defended women who were raped by high-ranking officers. After the guilty verdict, attacks followed and I had to escape.
I’ve been a refugee in Kakuma since 2013. Here in the camp we are a bit neglected. Sometimes I feel useless. But I still help women who have been raped. Sometimes they are pregnant or have HIV, so I take them to hospital and put them in contact with doctors. I hope to have the opportunity to defend people again – it is something inside me. Then I will be happy.”

The kindness of strangers: exhibition showcases items people have donated to refugees ","A touring exhibition, Museum Without A Home, tells the stories behind items people have donated to refugees and migrants
A cooking pot, a pair of running shoes, coloured crayons, a skipping rope. These are some of the everyday objects that have been ‘exhibited’ in the Museum Without A Home. The touring exhibition, which can be viewed online here, celebrates acts of kindness by ordinary people towards the men, women and children who are seeking peace and sanctuary in Europe.
The museum was originally created by the Greek section of Amnesty International and Oxfam to acknowledge the solidarity of the Greek people towards refugees. Organisers also hope to call on people – including political leaders – worldwide to support dignity and safety for all.
In autumn of 2016, the entire city of Athens was transformed into a ‘museum’ showcasing real objects that residents had donated to refugees to make them feel welcome. Each object was accompanied by the personal testimonies of the person who donated the objects and the person who received it.
Next to the photo of a board game reads the caption: “Stelios lives in Piraeus. When his school teacher proposed to the class to collect toys for the kids in the port of Piraeus, Stelios offered one of his favourite board games. He then found out that the game had reached the hands of Ishmael, a boy his age.”
Accompanying an image of a kettle reads the caption: “Vasso lives and works in Konitsa. Mafida from Syria is being hosted in the same region. When the two women met, Vasso offered a water kettle to Mafida so that she can easily heat water to wash her baby.”
Since 2016, the exhibition has travelled to Belfast, New York, Belgrade and Canada, as well as Leicester and Cambridge.
This is a celebration of small acts of welcome and generosity, that make all the difference to refugees as they rebuild their lives in the UK
Since it came to the UK, organisers displayed alongside the Greek objects several items that have been donated by the British public. Among them were a cooking pot and a quilt sewn by people from Witney, Oxfordshire, who hope to sponsor a family from Syria.
“This is a celebration of small acts of welcome and generosity, that make all the difference to refugees as they rebuild their lives in the UK,” said Sally Copley, Oxfam’s head of policy, programmes and campaigns. “We are calling on the government to extend its own hand of welcome by allowing refugees to reunite with their families in the UK.”

Who can be great mental health counsellors for refugees? Refugees ","A project in Germany allows refugees who know the mother tongue of asylum seekers and have experienced their situation first-hand, to offer much-needed psychological support
Refugees in Germany are being trained as mental health counsellors to offer psychological support – from a listening ear to sharing coping skills – to asylum seekers with similar backgrounds.
A pilot project was launched by Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) at St. Josef hospital in the city of Schweinfurt, Bavaria, in March 2017 after the charity noticed a stark lack of mental health support for asylum seekers.
“Our impression was that the asylum seekers had huge mental health needs that no one cares about,” said project coordinator and clinical psychologist Henrike Zellmann. “That is why we wanted to start a pilot project like this.”
Asylum seekers arriving in Schweinfurt, many of whom have experienced severe trauma, are offered counselling in their own language by trained lay counsellors who are also refugees. The counsellors are permanently employed at the hospital where their supervision and training is overseen by Zellmann, who also steps in when her professional help is needed. She hopes the project will be replicated in Germany and further afield too.
The talks with the counsellors here do me good. It helps when someone listens to me
Abdifatah is among the counsellors. Before coming to Germany, he worked as a journalist in Mogadishu and now helps Somalis who have fled the civil war in his native country.
“Once, a woman whose daughter had died came to see me,” he said. “She had lost everything. I felt that she was very alone. When she sat with me in the consulting room, she suddenly stopped and said ‘this is the first time in weeks that someone has offered me a tea’.”
Salah, another lay counsellor, believes that understanding people’s experiences first-hand is crucial. “They say ‘when I tell my story to a German, he does not understand. But when I tell it to you, you can understand what I’ve been through’.”

Yassin is from Aleppo, Syria, and lives with his wife and nine children in an asylum centre in Schweinfurt. His father and brother were killed by a barrel bomb – an improvised unguided bomb. His family’s journey to Europe turned his hair white. “The talks with the counsellors here do me good,” he said. “I am always looking for them. It helps when someone listens to me.”
Hamdi, (not his real name), fled the civil war in Yemen, crossing the Sahara and Mediterranean Sea en route to Germany. He lives in fear of deportation but is eager to help others, translating from Somali to Arabic for newly arrived asylum seekers. “I am busy and helpful. And I forget my situation a bit.”

New Zealand considers creating visas for climate change refugees ","As climate change forces people from their homes, New Zealand is pondering the creation of a visa for climate ‘refugees’ from Pacific islands
Plans are being drawn up by the government in New Zealand to create a new visa for climate change refugees. If implemented, it would be a world-first.
James Shaw – the Green party leader made climate change minister in the new Labour-led coalition government – said it was considering introducing “an experimental humanitarian visa category” for Pacific Ocean islanders who find themselves displaced by rising sea levels.
“It is a piece of work that we intend to do in partnership with the Pacific islands,” Shaw told Radio New Zealand.
Climate change is set to displace millions of people over the coming decades; among the most vulnerable are the inhabitants of low-lying Pacific islands such as Kiribati, which is slowly disappearing under the ocean.
It is a piece of work that we intend to do in partnership with the Pacific islands
A number of people from Kiribati and Tuvalu have already applied to live in New Zealand, claiming they are victims of climate change. However, their bids have been rejected because the country does not currently accommodate environmental refugees; only people who risk being persecuted by race, religion, nationality or by membership of a political or religious group.

Creating this category of visa would, in theory, make it easier for future applicants, but it remains to be seen how New Zealand would legally determine whether or not someone seeking asylum was able to live in their home country."

World Championships 2017: meet the Athlete Refugee Team ","With the World Athletics Championships under way in London, a film and a photography exhibition document how sport is improving the lives of those with no country to call their own
Sporting eyes are once again on the athletics track as the World Athletics Championships unfolds in and around the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park. Though stars such as Usain Bolt, and the controversy surrounding former drugs cheats may be dominating headlines, a team of refugees is competing for the first time in the competition’s 34-year history.
The Athlete Refugee Team: a small group of athletes with no nation of their own to represent, was first introduced at the 2016 Rio Olympics, and five members are now competing in London.
The South Sudanese, Somalian, Congolese and Ethiopian-born athletes fled civil wars and the dangers of being either killed or forced into becoming child soldiers. They left their countries to start new lives. But going from the Kenyan refugee camp where they were all scouted for the team, to competing in major athletics tournaments is a transformation that few would have anticipated.
Scouted by Kenyan charity the Tegla Loroupe Peace Foundation (TLPF) – founded by former Kenyan long distance track and road runner Tegla Loroupe – the athletes have been given training and accommodation in Kenya, as well as educational opportunities.
I have to polish my talent and show people in the world that a refugee can make it
Now, a film and an exhibition of photographs taken in the team’s Kenyan base, have been created to tell the athletes’ stories. The project is called #WeAreAllOne.
Meet the refugees competing in this year’s World Championships
James Nyang Chiengjiek
400 metres
James was scouted at a refugee camp by former Kenyan running star Tegla Loroupe. It was her vision that led to the first ever Refugee Team entering the Maracanã Stadium in Rio in 2016. James was part of that team, too.
Gai Nyang Tap
800 metres
Gai, 25, is originally from South Sudan and one of 31 refugee athletes based at the Tegla Loroupe Refugee Athletes Training Center in the Ngong Hills, Kenya. They come from five nations and several ethnic groups. They are, however, all athletes. “Whether African, refugees or whatever, we are all one,” he says.
Rose Nathike Lokonyen
800 metres
Like all the refugee athletes, Rose has experienced the horror of war first-hand. Her journey to compete in London began when she ran away from her village aged just seven, leaving behind her mother and father. Now she is determined not to be another casualty of war. She focuses on the opportunities in front of her. She wants to become a champion.
Kadar Omar Abdullah
5,000 metres
Kadar is 21 and from Ethiopia. At the trials for London in June, he moved from his usual event, the 1500m, and entered the 5000m. He won the qualifier and smashed his own personal best. His coaches believe that when he moves from the dirt track in Ngong Hills, Kenya, to sea level in London, he could make yet another great leap forward against the clock. His race takes place on Saturday.
Anjelina Nadai Lohalith
1,500 metres
Less than a year after running in a trial at Kakuma refugee camp in north-west Kenya, Anjelina entered the Maracanã Stadium in Rio to represent the 65 million stateless people worldwide. “Now this is my time. I have to polish my talent and show people in the world that a refugee can make it,” she says.
Off the track
Living arrangements
Athletes live in close quarters: four to a room in double bunks. With many different cultures and religions represented, they must be very respectful of each other’s customs. Inside the camp, men and women are considered equal: there are no specific gender roles around household chores.
Winding down
Coaches have introduced regular massage and physical therapy for the athletes. There is often a line of sore limbs waiting for renewal on the table. But these aren’t the sorts of massages you get in spas. Bones crack, teeth clench and the odd tear pops as knots are worked out.
Day-to-day life
When athletes are not training, they undertake chores in the accommodation that is provided for them. They do all their own washing, ironing and cleaning, and take turns helping prepare food. They also take daily naps to recover from the rigours of intense high-altitude training.
Down time
A ride into town for a little shopping and fun down the bumpy roads of Ngong. This is Lydia Philip Mamuon. At just 16, she is one half of an inseparable pair, along with 17-year-old Sunday Kamisa Peter. They are by far the youngest athletes staying at the training camp and seem to gain a lot of strength by sticking close to one another.
#WeAreAllOne launched on 8 August at the Eight Club in Moorgate, London alongside a charity photography auction featuring images by sports photographers including Marcus Smith, Alexis Berg, Daniel Meuli and Thomas Stöckli.

The conservative US state where refugees are being welcomed with open arms ","Refugees are not a common sight in out-of-the-way Montana, but Missoula resident Mary Poole and her book club decided to make a change by welcoming fleeing families into their homes
After helping a donor unload a box of pots and pans in the reception area, Mary Poole settles in behind her desk in a cramped office. “I used to make jewellery,” she laughs, referring to her life more than a year and a half ago, before she became executive director of Soft Landing in Missoula, Montana.
Today, Poole runs the small non-profit, which helped persuade the International Rescue Committee to establish a refugee resettlement office here last year. At a time when resettlement is politically contentious, the non-profit is providing support to refugees from across the world in a politically conservative state where only 107 refugees have been resettled since 2001, the lowest total of any US state except Wyoming.
Soft Landing’s focus is as much on the Missoula community as on incoming refugees. The organisation, which consists of two part-time staff members, coordinates volunteers to support incoming refugees, including families that help place refugees to their new home and connect them to their neighbours. The organisation also promotes dialogue among community members on the sometimes uncomfortable topic of resettlement. Their mission is to ensure the Missoula community is both welcoming and informed.
Before co-founding Soft Landing, Poole says, “I didn’t even know what a refugee was. I didn’t know what resettlement was; I had no context.”
I didn’t even know what a refugee was. I didn’t know what resettlement was – I had no context
Poole isn’t alone. Montana is an expansive rural state with the third lowest population density in the United States (7.1 square miles per person) and less diversity (89 per cent white) than all but seven states. These factors contribute to the state’s reputation for being culturally parochial and politically conservative. Last November, 56.4 per cent of residents who cast a ballot supported President Trump.
It’s also been roughly 37 years since a significant population of refugees was resettled here within a short time frame. Between 1979 and 1980, roughly 366 Hmong refugees were resettled in Missoula, a more liberal community than much of the rest of the state, after fleeing repression from communist forces in Laos.

Now, nearly 40 years later, Missoula is accepting refugees again. Since August 2016, 117 refugees have been resettled in Missoula from Iraq, Syria, Ethiopia, Eritrea, and the Democratic Republic of Congo – more than the total number resettled in the entire state over the past 16 years. And hundreds of local volunteers have joined Soft Landing to make them feel welcome.
When asked why she decided to lead the organisation, Poole responds thoughtfully. “It came about because of the picture of a dead child,” she says. “I don’t feel like there was a choice. It was something so much deeper than a thought or a decision.”
Poole is referring to the tragic photo of a drowned Syrian refugee — three-year-old Aylan Kurdi — lying face down on a beach near Bodrum, Turkey. The boy’s family had been fleeing their war-torn home in Syria when their boat capsized in early September 2015. The photo was widely shared and helped bring the “migrant crisis into focus,” according to one headline from the New York Times.
As mothers, we couldn’t stop thinking about it
Poole remembers seeing the photo on Facebook while she was breastfeeding her then nine-month-old son. She was grief-stricken. Before that, Poole says, she would have struggled to locate Syria on a map and would never have identified herself as an activist.
After seeing the photo, Poole reached out to women in her book club to process the crisis in Syria. Everyone had seen it, she recalls. “As mothers, we couldn’t stop thinking about it.”
The dialogue sparked a group exchange over email, and eventually someone asked, “what can we do about this?”
Together, the women had the idea to bring refugees across the world to Missoula, but they had no idea where to begin. So they began talking to their neighbours. “The idea passed around to a couple friends and then a couple more. Pretty soon we had a strong group of [interested] people,” Poole says.
By October 2015, Poole had teamed up with several more community members to establish Soft Landing and secure fiscal sponsorship from a local non-profit. Volunteers then began reaching out to US-based resettlement agencies, eventually reaching Robert Johnson, former executive director at the International Rescue Committee’s (IRC) office in Seattle.
The connection was both timely and fortuitous. The IRC was already considering locations for new offices to accommodate an increase in the refugees allowed into the United States, from 70,000 in fiscal year 2015 to 85,000 in 2016. Johnson also knew the Missoula community well. He had been involved with the IRC’s work in Missoula with Hmong refugees at the beginning of his career and had visited Montana several times on fly-fishing trips.
“We knew from experience that Missoula was a good town with a lot of international awareness,” Johnson says. “It’s a favourable political environment that’s unique in Montana.”
The existence of Soft Landing made his decision even easier. “The big bonus was there was a local group that was willing to provide support,” Johnson says. “That’s a unique and attractive quality.”
He made a trip in November 2015 and wrote a proposal for review by the US State Department, which approved a new IRC office in March 2016.
“The first family arrived in late August,” Poole explains, “one week shy of a year since those photos of Aylan Kurdi came out.”
Our goal is just to create a more welcoming environment for refugees to call home
Today, when refugee families arrive in Missoula, volunteer mentors meet them at the airport and stay in close contact with them from day one. Soft Landing’s services are client-driven from that point forward.
“It’s a huge choose-your-own-adventure,” says Poole, who recruits volunteers to do everything from teaching driver’s education and English courses to providing childcare and financial counselling. After a recent CrowdRise campaign netted $32,000 (£25,000), the part-time director hopes this adventure will continue for the volunteer driven organisation.
“There’s just a very independent, western spirit here that leads us to say, ‘of course we can.’”
This approach has continued to serve Soft Landing well as the organisation moves forward in a political climate marked by anti-immigrant rhetoric and executive orders. In January, after President Trump issued his first travel ban blocking citizens of Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen from entry into the country for 90 days, hundreds of Missoulians gathered in the city centre to protest the order, including Poole.
But Poole’s careful to point out that protesting policies is different from protesting people with different perspectives. In fact, cultivating understanding between those who wish to welcome refugees and those who oppose their resettlement has become an important goal for Soft Landing, especially since the arrival of refugees in Missoula has been a source of contention in surrounding towns and rural areas.
“Doing something as large and life-changing as bringing refugees to a community that hasn’t done that in a long time requires more than just supporters to be engaged and interested,” she says. To this end, Poole recently participated in a public information meeting in Hamilton, Montana, a place where local county government sent a letter to the US State Department opposing refugee resettlement in Missoula. The purpose of the meeting was to share information about refugee resettlement and listen to concerns, according to Poole, not to settle an argument.
This is a tactful approach in Montana, a rural state that recently elected a vocal supporter of the travel ban, Greg Gianforte, to Congress following a contentious special election. The approach, though, comes naturally to Poole and her colleagues.
“Our goal is not to convince people what we’re doing is right and what they’re doing is wrong,” she says. “Our goal is just to create a more welcoming environment for refugees to call home.”
In fact, she says, “We have another family arriving tonight.”

‘Despite the headlines, people care’ say team behind new refugee befriending scheme ","Londoners are being asked to take part in a befriending scheme that matches people with spare time and goodwill, to asylum seekers and refugees who are in need of friendship
A befriending scheme has been launched to match Londoners who have spare time and goodwill, with asylum seekers and refugees in need of friendship.
HostNation, which launched a pilot scheme in Greater London in March and hopes to expand across the UK by 2018, would like to hear from volunteers willing to befriend newcomers to the city. Anneke Elwes, who came up with the concept of HostNation after studying for a master’s degree in Anthropology of Development, has worked with refugees and asylum seekers for more than five years. Her dissertation titled Humanitarianism at Home, looked into the private practice of hosting refugees and asylum seekers.
#3: Join the movement for positive media
Connect with others who are creating a thriving society. Positive News members get priority invitation to our events. We’re a magazine and a movement, changing the news for good.
“I’m acutely aware of how desperately lonely and bored so many of them are,” Elwes told Positive News. “They are stuck in substandard accommodation on the fringes of our cities, often with only £5 of vouchers to see them through the day. When I asked a conversation group I run how they could improve their English, they said ‘make an English friend’ but when I asked how they would do that, they were at a loss. It’s not easy.”
So far, more than 100 volunteers are registered as ‘befrienders’ – indicating that they are willing to help refugees and asylum seekers through their first three months in new communities. They will offer help such as weekly phone calls and outings such as spending an afternoon walking, sightseeing, or simply helping them practice their English through talking. “Compassionate citizens want to help,” said Elwes, “but don’t know how”.
From weekly phone calls, to afternoons spent sightseeing, volunteers can help refugees feel at home
She points to research that suggests social inclusion is most likely to succeed when it comes from grassroots engagement with local people and civil society. HostNation, which is a Community Interest Company, offers a web-based referral process, and online training and support. Volunteers will be screened, and the project team is particularly keen to hear from people with experience of supporting refugees and vulnerable people, or with backgrounds in social care and volunteering
“There are a lot of refugees who come to the UK, particularly unaccompanied young people, who have had a very traumatic journey here,” said one volunteer, who has taken part in a similar befriending scheme. “I just felt that actually, you need some help in situations like that – some kind of support.”
Compassionate citizens want to help but don’t know how
Some befrienders have already developed lifelong friendships with the people and families they have helped resettle in to their new lives in the UK – friendships that will “go on for as long as we live” noted a volunteer.
HostNation is also designed to work alongside other initiatives and projects specialising in supporting refugees, from other befriending initiatives and refugee services, to support groups.
The overall objective is to instill in refugees and asylum seekers a sense of value and welcome from people in the UK. “Despite the headlines,” said Elwes, “people care”.

Take in more Syrian refugees, urges UK public ","New research challenges the government’s assertion that there is little capacity to house Syrian refugees. Local authorities have now committed to accommodate nearly 22,000 people fleeing from the country – and grassroots pressure has been key
The number of offers from councils in the UK to host Syrian refugees has now exceeded the government pledge of taking in 20,000. Local authorities have already committed enough homes to accommodate 21,650 Syrian refugees, according to research by the Guardian.
In many cases, councils have upped their offers of help after campaigns by grassroots charities and community groups. Some report being “overwhelmed” by public support to help resettle people displaced by the six-year war in the Middle Eastern nation. Around 30 local authorities report that housing was freed up after charities and faith groups made property available.
Civil society is more than ready. It makes me very proud as a Brit; very proud as a former refugee
Bekele Woyecha, a community organiser at Citizens UK, is a former refugee from Ethiopia. “Civil society is more than ready,” he said. “I think there is an information gap: Citizens UK was able to build 96 welcome teams across Britain in 18 months who were all willing to do their bit locally. The British public is ready to keep the tradition of offering sanctuary. It makes me very proud as a Brit; very proud as a former refugee.”
Bekele Woyecha is an organiser at Citizens UK, a charity that builds and supports civil society alliances
The finding contrasts starkly with claims by Robert Goodwill, UK immigration minister, that a lack of capacity at local authority level meant he must significantly reduce the number of unaccompanied children to be offered refuge in the UK.
Many councils have pledged to make even more properties available if necessary. More than 6,000 Syrian refugees have been settled in the UK so far.

Alexandra Rizio
Defending children from deportation
Alexandra Rizio is a lawyer who represents child refugees facing deportation
Alexandra Rizio has long fought for refugees in her professional life, starting as a volunteer with the Refugee and Immigrant Fund in Queens, New York. Today, she is a senior staff attorney at Safe Passage Project, where she also serves as co-coordinator of the Unaccompanied Latin American Minor Project (ULAMP), a collaboration with City University of New York’s John Jay College of Criminal Justice that provides pro bono legal assistance to children in deportation proceedings.
In 2014, when parts of Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala saw a brutal uptick in violence and poverty, many children fled, some without an adult to shepherd them to safety. After making it across the US border, says Rizio, children are often detained immediately, then sent to foster homes or relatives elsewhere. And their journeys are just beginning.
“We’ll show up on their first day of court with volunteer attorneys and translators,” Rizio says. “If it weren’t for organisations like Safe Passage and others, they would literally be on their own facing the judge.”
Since ULAMP teamed up with Safe Passage in 2014, attorneys have represented 830 children in the state of New York and spared 208 children from deportation.

Enrique Morones
An ‘angel’ to immigrants on the border
Enrique Morones founded Border Angels, a charity that helps keep alive migrants crossing the US/Mexico border
For years, Enrique Morones helped Mexican immigrants by leaving water bottles, food and blankets along the California border, through the Imperial Valley desert and mountainous regions of San Diego County.
In 2001, Morones, then an executive with [baseball franchise] the San Diego Padres, left his job and took his involvement to a higher level: he established the volunteer organisation Border Angels and began speaking out across the country for immigration reform.
Since then, Morones has seen the US-Mexico border transform into a national flashpoint for immigration, from protests to the formation of vigilante militias that threaten to shoot people crossing the border. Over the past 18 years, more than 6,000 people have died making the trek.
Our organisation is standing by migrants to make sure they’re protected
Meanwhile, Border Angels has expanded its mission by providing food to immigrants at day-labourer sites and, with the help of Border Patrol, organising Opening the Door of Hope events that enable families who are separated by the border to visit.
Since the US presidential election, volunteer interest in Border Angels has soared.
“People are scared,” Morones says. “But our organisation is standing by [migrants] to make sure they’re protected.”
Gader Ibrahim
Bringing necessities to young refugees in need
Gader Ibrahim, founder of Operation Refugee Child, with her family
In 2014, a few years into the Syrian civil war, there were one million people in refugee camps in Jordan. That same year, Gader Ibrahim visited one of those camps and saw children sleeping in the snow and wandering idle and scared. So she organised blanket and toy drives and personally delivered the supplies to children on both sides of the border. After the war in Syria escalated, she moved from Jordan to the US and, in 2015, founded Operation Refugee Child (ORC), a programme that delivers backpacks full of necessities to refugee camps in Greece.
We’re focusing on the kids because we know they have nothing
“We’re focusing on the kids and giving them backpacks because we know they have nothing and they have a long way to go,” Ibrahim says.
Ibrahim stages part of her effort in Athens and two other Greek cities that are home to large refugee camps for people fleeing to Europe and Canada. There, Ibrahim and her team of four volunteers distribute backpacks with items like toys, blankets, toothbrushes, protein bars, raincoats and underwear. And through its Hope Box programme, ORC has sent 10,000lb (4,500kg) of donations, mostly food. To date, Ibrahim and her team have given 6,000 backpacks in the US and overseas.

Paris to sell off lovers’ locks to fund refugee projects ","Up to 10 tonnes of ‘love locks’ recently removed from bridges in the French capital will be sold, raising up to €100,000 (£85,080) for refugee groups
Since opting 18 months ago to clamp down on the trend of lovers attaching symbolic padlocks to the city’s bridges, Paris has been left with 65 tonnes of scrap metal.
Bruno Julliard, the city’s first deputy mayor, has announced that around 10 tonnes of the locks will be sold to members of the public and the proceeds sent to refugee groups.
Julliard told the Guardian: “Members of the public can buy five or 10 locks, or even clusters of them, all at an affordable price. All of the proceeds will be given to those who work in support and in solidarity of the refugees in Paris.”
He hoped the sale, which is likely to take place in 2017, could raise up to €100,000, while the remaining locks will be melted down and sold as scrap.

Mussa, a Kurdish-Syrian boy, had been living for months in an unofficial camp at the Greek port of Piraeus when he met photographer Nessim Stevenson.
Strong, stubborn and cunning, the five-year-old spent his days teasing volunteers and sneaking into a storage warehouse in search of juice and croissants. A few days before he was photographed, he had led a group of friends out of the makeshift camp for a trip to the beach, only returning under the cover of dark.
Stevenson said: “His expression here represents the pride and resilience of his people despite the desperate living conditions in the camp and the uncertain future they face.”

The Kurdish refugee who found a new home in Wales ","After fleeing for his life more than once, Kurdish refugee Salah Rasool found a new home in Wales. He offers advice to people who are new to the UK today
“We walked for 11 days and nights to the Iranian border. It was pouring with rain and Saddam’s helicopters were surrounding us. We lost my sister and her husband.”
These are the memories of Salah Rasool, a Welsh-Kurdish father and humanitarian. His missing relatives were found alive three months after they sought refuge that night, but this wasn’t the first or the last time they would be forced to flee Iraqi Kurdistan.
The first exodus came in 1975, when Rasool was just a baby. His family had to abandon home again during the Iran-Iraq war when he was 16, just before his pregnant mother suffered a stillbirth. Then the Kurdish civil war hit and they fled a third time in 1996.
Rasool describes how each time they returned to an empty house, having lost everything: “I felt that nothing could be permanent as there was never political or social stability,” he says. “It made me feel powerless and hopeless. I realised that our lives and future were in the power of a dictator and his brutal regimes.”
After the family’s third exodus, Rasool felt he could not endure another. The young biology graduate trekked across Iran’s mountains in search of a new home. To get to the UK, he spent nine months working as a tailor, hidden in a shop, where he was “at the mercy of the greedy, inhumane owner”. He earned just enough to make it to mainland Europe by foot and endured a long, harrowing journey to the UK, where he was finally granted leave to remain. “I was free to work, study, to be treated as a human. My world had opened,” he says.
I was free to work, study, to be treated as a human. My world had opened
But his journey wasn’t over quite yet. After several weeks visiting Liverpool, Manchester, Birmingham and Leeds, Rasool followed a friend’s suggestion and ventured into Wales. The hills dotted with houses descending to the city of Swansea immediately reminded Rasool of his native landscape. “My heart felt open and for the first time in many years I was ready to make my life,” he says. “I felt I was free.”
The Welsh concept of hiraeth is similar to homesickness. It is nostalgia for a loss of some kind, often connected to a sense of homeland, hovering between sad and wistful. This bittersweetness is part of Rasool’s new life: “While I’m here in Wales, I still count Kurdistan as a home. And when I’m in Kurdistan, I feel that Wales is where I’ve made my home,” he explains. “If I dwell too much it makes me sad, so instead I think both are home – my life has been enriched. I feel privileged.”
Rasool’s first job in the UK was in a factory that made crisps, and in his spare time, he volunteered as an interpreter. Before long he was offered a full-time role with the Welsh Refugee Council, helping others seeking new lives in Wales. “It made me feel like I could contribute and build bridges,” he says. “I felt valued.”
Rasool’s love for his adopted home is clear. “Wales made it possible for me to find a house, get a job, join English and Welsh classes and to meet people – warm, humorous and honest people. There really is something magical about this land.”
He met his Welsh wife while working at the Welsh Refugee Council and the couple now have two children: “I became part of something permanent, bright and happy,” he says. The couple’s wedding, nearly 10 years ago, made national headlines for their decision to take the vows in Welsh – a celebration of Rasool’s new homeland.
Wales made it possible for me to find a house, get a job, learn English and meet warm, humorous and honest people
Now living in Cardiff, Rasool is an active member of the Kurdish-Welsh community, and is keen to help others settle in. His advice for newcomers? “Learn the language, meet local people and other communities and step out of your comfort zone,” he says. “Volunteer, set yourself challenges and give something back to the UK.”
He admits it can be difficult to strike a balance between looking back and moving forwards. “Don’t live in the past, but don’t forget your roots,” he says. “Appreciate the freedom and make the most of your new lives.”"

Documentary tells story of Greek islanders who saved drowning refugees ","A Syrian filmmaker has made a documentary about the Greek ‘island heroes’ at the frontline of the refugee crisis, some of whom have been nominated for the Nobel peace prize
When thousands fled my homeland of Syria in 2015, on the perilous sea journey to the Greek island of Lesvos, many were rescued and cared for by the islanders. They showed extraordinary compassion and humanity.
When the refugees began to arrive on Lesvos, the people spontaneously put their lives on hold to help and give hope and refuge to the displaced men, women and children who landed on their shores. From the darkness of the war in Syria, a light shone from Greece – a place I came to know and love.
From the darkness of the war in Syria, a light shone from Greece
Our documentary, Ode to Lesvos, is about these individuals who, with an unbreakable generosity of spirit, provided hope and positivity to some of Syria’s displaced families. When the opportunity came to make a film about them, I didn’t hesitate for a second.
People like the fisherman Stratis Valamios, who spent months on end rescuing people from the waters around his home in Skala Sikaminias, saving boats full of water with 50 or 60 people on board – many of them woman and children. For him it’s simple; we should all help one another because tomorrow we might be the ones in need.
Fisherman Stratis Valamios used his boat to rescue those at sea, an act he says he didn’t think twice about
Other islanders, like one of the grandmothers, Aimilia Kamvisi, tell of how they brought food, kept refugees company and looked after babies. They are the heroes in a film that represents one chapter in a larger, evolving story. It shows how these simple acts of kindness and positivity made a difference to the lives of those who made such a dangerous journey in search of a better future.
Having worked as a documentary filmmaker and journalist in Syria and knowing first-hand the horror and despair refugees face as they seek safety, shelter and a better future, I was inspired to tell the uplifting story of the response of the community of Lesvos.
Aimilia Kamvisi is one of three grandmothers who took care of rescued refugees on a daily basis. Now, she and the others say they miss the families they helped
In 2013 I was completing my film, Return to Homs, and visited Germany in the summer to start the editing. By September I realised that the conflict in Syria was not going to be resolved quickly, so I decided to apply for political protection residency in Germany for myself and my family.
We were fortunate enough to escape the devastation of a dangerous sea crossing, but I know only too well the traumatic passage through testimonies of relatives and friends.
For me personally, in my darkest moments, I remember the heroes I learned about in the films I have made. Then, I never lose hope. They inspire me to look forward in my filmmaking and in my personal life – no matter how difficult. They drive me to stay positive and to never give up.

Three good things: apps for refugees ","Three apps are helping refugees connect and build links in their new communities
Image: Welcome!
1. Arriving in a new country can be overwhelming. Public authorities are able to provide accommodation and food, but don’t often have the capacity to support social needs. Swedish app Welcome! aims to fill the gap. It features an easy-to-navigate platform giving refugees access to information including on government policies, jobs and schools. A chat function allows newcomers to ask locals questions to help them settle in, such as where to find free internet access. It has been downloaded more than 10,000 times.

2. Refugees report feeling confused and isolated when new to a country, especially if they can’t speak the language. Refugeye aims to help newcomers communicate via pictograms and drawings in situations where words fail, such as when registering with the authorities. The app’s creator, Paris-based graphic designer Geoffrey Dorne, hopes it will help them avoid missing out on advice and support for which they’re eligible. He built it after attending a hackathon where he interviewed refugees and employees of UNHCR – the UN Refugee Agency. The project is open-source, meaning anyone can contribute.

3. Breaking bread with strangers has long been seen as a way to build bridges within communities. Those at Refoodgee want to help refugees in Berlin feel at home by using a mutual love of food to unite them with locals. Newcomers to the German capital can sign up, noting the languages they speak and cuisine preferences, before being paired with hosts accordingly. Its creators, a group of tech entrepreneurs, hope that the app will smooth social integration. They say that preparing and enjoying a meal isn’t about what’s on the plate, but sharing stories and getting to know each other.

Olympic hopefuls bring inspiration to refugee camp ","Kakuma refugee camp in north-west Kenya has been a place of celebration this week as residents cheer on their friends and family flying the flag for Team Refugee
The sun is setting on another hot day in Kakuma refugee camp. On any normal evening, people would be hurrying home before the 8pm curfew, anxious to avoid trouble with the police. But every night for the past two weeks, the hurried scamper home has been replaced by an excited stream of people heading towards the temporary giant screens set up in the camp.
The Kakuma camp residents – who number more than 200,000 – have been gathering nightly to cheer on Team Refugee in the Rio Olympics, the first ever team made up of people displaced by war, famine and persecution. The screens have been streaming live coverage of the Olympics in a collaboration between the UN High Commission for Refugees, FilmAid and Amnesty International.
Of the team of 10, half are long-distance runners who have lived in Kakuma since fleeing civil war in South Sudan. This includes 23-year-old Rose Nathike Lokonyen, who waved the Olympic flag in honour of the 21.3 million estimated refugees worldwide during the opening ceremony.
The five runners are joined by two swimmers from Syria, a pair of Congolese Judokas and a marathon runner from Ethiopia.
Buol Jol Noi has been a refugee for almost 30 years, moving between Sudan, Ethiopia and Kenya. “This team represents all of us. Whether it is a Syrian swimmer or my neighbour from Kakuma, I cheer for them equally because they are fellow refugees.”
“The Syrians, Congolese and Ethiopians are our brothers and sisters,” agrees Mary Aluer Kur, a 21-year-old who has lived in Kakuma for her entire life. “They are in our same situation so we can understand each other. When a Syrian has won, we have all won.”

They are in our same situation so we can understand each other. When a Syrian has won, we have all won
Mary has been training as a journalist with FilmAid. Covering the Olympics has opened her eyes to how much talent there is in a place like Kakuma, and the effect the Olympic screenings have had on the young. “Refugees feel stuck in limbo and don’t believe in themselves. But seeing our friends go to the Olympics has inspired young people to try their best, because for the first time there is hope their efforts will be recognised,” says Mary.
It’s late afternoon and Rose is about to compete in the women’s 800-metre. The screening has not started yet, but people are gathering and a buzz is in the air. Close by, a few young children are about to kick off their own race. One girl joins the others just before the word ‘go’, and stumbles across the finish line next to last, ahead of her younger brother.
Her family look on and laugh. “Rose and Anjelina, the two female runners from Kakuma, are her new heroes. She can’t wait for them to come back so she can meet them,” says her father Deng, who fled South Sudan with his family in 2004. “If she continues running like that, we’ll be proud to see her going to the next Olympics.”

27, from Somalia
I felt capable. It freed me of that negative cloud
I was born in Somalia in the middle of war. I was one of the few lucky girls able to take my GCSEs. Then I got a scholarship to study international business in Malaysia. I stayed there for six years, then went back to Somalia, but I had to leave at the age of 25 to escape a forced marriage. My mother paid a smuggler to take me to London in November, 2014. He dropped me in an area where there were Somalis. It was so cold. I spent the first night with a woman I’d met on the streets.
I went to the Home Office and applied for asylum. They sent me to Liverpool, then Manchester and put me in shared accommodation. I couldn’t work. When I finally got my papers in February 2015, I was told to move out of my accommodation. I had no money so I stayed with a Somali family and, in October, moved to London where I stayed with Somali cousins. I started to look for a job: I sent loads of applications and went for a few interviews, but they all wanted UK experience. Then I found Breaking Barriers [a charity helping refugees to find meaningful employment] and everything changed. They found me this two-month placement at Source8 [a corporate services company], working as an analyst and doing research. At first, I couldn’t speak. I was so shy. But step by step, my confidence grew.
As a refugee, all you hear is negative. Everything seems to conspire to put you down, so you think that maybe you are never going to make it. But at Source8, I felt positive. They trusted me with important things. I felt capable. It freed me of that negative cloud. I’ve gained skills, experience and confidence. Now, I am hopeful I can find a good job.

29, from Syria
I first felt at home when I started teaching about my country
I grew up in Damascus in a middle class, moderate Muslim family. I graduated as a dentist in 2012, but I would have had to do military service under Assad’s regime, so I fled to Beirut, then to Egypt. I applied twice to go to Canada but got rejected, so in 2014 decided to go to Europe. From Alexandria, I paid a smuggler $2,000 (£1,370) and boarded a small boat with 400 other people. After seven days at sea, we were rescued by a Korean ship and two days later reached Italy.
In Paris, I was told not to go to the UK via Calais because they check the lorries, so I went to Brussels where I worked in a Syrian restaurant illegally to raise the $1,000 (£685) the smuggler wanted. I finally made it to Dover aboard a German lorry – four months after I had set out.
In Dover, I was taken to a refugee centre full of people from all over the world. I was sent to Yorkshire in December 2014 and a few months later, got my asylum status, so I decided to move to London. For a month, I slept in churches and mosques, then I found a room in a house in Chiswick with 10 others. A journalist interviewed me on the BBC and that led to a job at Starbucks during weekends and to speaking engagements in schools.
I first felt at home when I started teaching about my country. Students are very involved; they ask lots of questions. My life in London was difficult, but at school I could forget how I feel. I am happy. I am teaching people about my country and the revolution – I am doing something important. I still dream about working as a dentist, but I need to pass two exams and each costs £3,000.
I love Shepherd’s Bush because there are a lot of Syrian restaurants and shops there. Here people speak with Syrian accents. I am in London, but I am in Syria.
Pipash Mahabubur Rahaman
34, from Bangladesh
I met people who knew me from back home; I could speak my language
I am from the southern part of Bangladesh. I worked as a political journalist for a large opposition newspaper until it was banned by the government. We were arrested and tortured several times. I decided to go to the UK because the son of our former prime minister and senior vice chairman of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party live here. I arrived in September 2014 and my wife and baby daughter joined me in July 2015.
At first, I was anxious. I was not sure where to go or what to do, but friends told me to go to Brick Lane where there is a large Bangladeshi community. I met people who knew me from back home; I could speak my language and eat Bangladeshi food. I used to come every day to meet up with friends and discuss politics. I still try to come once a week.
I feel safe here, but I need to adjust; in Bangladesh, I was on the highest echelons of society and here I am at the bottom. Life is stressful – the costs of living are so high. When I got my refugee status, I started to look for a job. Most Bangladeshi people here work in restaurants or in retail, but I want to work in journalism. I went to the Jobcentre and they said I could get a Jobseeker’s Allowance, but I would prefer if they could help me build my skills so I could work in my profession. I sent out thousands of applications and finally, in January, found a job as an invigilator. I also write for Bangladeshi newspapers and blogs. I try to understand the culture here, so I volunteer at Citizens Advice and attend political events.
I like it here: the education, the lifestyle and transport, and people are friendly. They believe in morality and obey the rules. People stop at red lights even at night! But I think about my country, my mother and my editor. I worry about my friends and family. I would go back to Bangladesh if it were a peaceful country. I still write and work towards this.

46, from Iran
Imagine you have been kept in a cage then the door suddenly opens
I am a cultural and human rights activist from Ahwaz, a region where much of Iran’s Arab minority lives. The government wants to destroy our language, culture and even our land. When I was 14, I was arrested and tortured after a protest. After that, my name was in the system and I got tortured a lot. In 2000, we decided to leave. Seven of my friends were arrested while fleeing and three were hung, but I made it to Turkey on horse and on foot across the mountains. My wife and our children joined me there. But we couldn’t make a living, so after three years my wife returned to Iran and I went to Italy, France and Holland, and finally arrived in Coventry in June 2003, smuggled aboard a lorry.
I went to London’s Elephant and Castle, which has a large Ahwazi Arab population. In February 2004, I got my indefinite leave to remain. From the first day I arrived in England, dirty, exhausted and hungry, I felt like a newborn. Imagine that you have been kept in a cage for years then the door suddenly opens. I am safe here. I never felt at home in my own country because I was a second, third-class citizen. But here, I feel myself. I feel part of the country – 100 per cent British.
Now I try to give something back: I work as a mental health nurse and volunteer to help other refugees.
Charles (he prefers not to give his surname)
47, from Senegal
The place where I feel most at home is the British Library
I was born in Dakar, the capital of Senegal, but my father’s work took us to various African countries. I went back to Senegal to go to secondary school, then went to medical school and passed a very prestigious exam that opened doors for me to work in hospital, do research and teach at university.
After completing my speciality medical training in Bordeaux, I also worked for the UN as a consultant in reproductive health, female genital mutilation (FGM), gender-based violence and HIV, and created an association to cater to the needs of the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) community.
That’s when my problems started. I was repeatedly assaulted by masked men who said that the work I was doing was “haram” [forbidden under Islamic law] and sinful. I couldn’t report the attacks to the police because homosexuality is illegal in Senegal. The last attack was the worst: I was kept in a room for three days with no food or water. I thought I was going to die.
In 2011, I fled to England because it is a tolerant country where people are open-minded and respect differences. Things were very difficult, but now I have permission to work, have passed my last exam to register as a doctor and recently got an opportunity to do a six-month training stint in a London hospital.
Things are getting better, but I am away from my country, from my people, and sometimes I think: “I studied hard for 11 good years, I had a good job, yet I lost almost a decade of my life living in limbo. Why should I have to go through all of this?”
But I have no regrets. Those who want to change the world have to face big challenges. And here I can have a future. I want to feel safe, work as a doctor and live in a quieter, greener place.
The place where I feel most at home is the British Library. I spent a lot of time there, studying for my exams, writing, thinking. It’s a place full of history. When you study there, your motivation is boosted by the legacy of all the great people, like Karl Marx, who did research there.

Employment and opportunity the key to refugee integration ","Employment is an integral tool for tackling refugees’ social and economic exclusion, says Matthew Powell – CEO of charity Breaking Barriers
I met the first refugee I ever supported at a cafe in Holborn, London in December 2014. Jamal was 56 years old and from Iran. He had arrived in the UK more than 15 years ago with his wife and young son in the face of political persecution.
Despite being in the UK for so long — he was fluent in English and his understanding of the culture was great — it was evident that his awful experiences all those years ago were still inhibiting his ability to find a job.
A lack of self-confidence, self-worth and a belief that he was capable of flourishing — and like many other refugees, a significant gap on his CV due to the lengthy asylum-seeking process — contributed to making it difficult for him to find a job.
This re-affirmed my belief that employment is a crucial part of the integration process. After all, this was the entire premise of Breaking Barriers, the charity I was setting up based on research I conducted while studying a master’s at the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE).
I had always considered myself entrepreneurial, always thought I would set up and run my own business. This is probably what gave me the belief and desire to pursue the concept of the charity, which provides employment training and placement for people who have arrived in the UK as refugees. Now I call myself a social entrepreneur, someone who looks to come up with creative solutions to systemic social issues.
The narrative is that there is a humanitarian crisis abroad, but there is a humanitarian crisis on our doorstep
The numbers are stark: an Ipsos MORI survey carried out for the Greater London Authority in 2010 showed employment rates for refugees in London were 31 per cent, compared to 61 per cent for the general population and 59 per cent for the British, black, Asian and minority ethnic (BME) population.
The majority of refugees who were unemployed had been looking for work for more than a year. Those who were employed were primarily working in low-skilled, low-paid and often dangerous jobs despite high levels of education, work experience and what I would later find out was a real determination to work.
Take the story of Milad, a 29-year-old man from Damascus, Syria. He had a great life in Syria. He had always dreamed of becoming a dentist. The day he graduated with a degree in dentistry from university he was, like other Syrian men, called up to military service under Assad’s regime.
As part of this military service, he would have been asked to kill and torture people he loved and who shared his vision of democracy and peace. Milad had to flee Syria and risked his life on a nine-day boat journey across the Mediterranean, knowing there was a strong possibility he would die en route.
His family was also forced to flee. His brothers are now in Sweden, Saudi Arabia and Germany. His parents are in a refugee camp in Lebanon. Breaking Barriers employees Milad to share his story in schools. He works at Starbucks on weekends. Do people really think he risked his life and chose to leave behind his home, career, possessions, family and friends simply for a better life?
Life for many refugees in London is pretty bleak. One of the Syrian refugees Breaking Barriers supports once described his life in London as living “in one hell having escaped from another”.
The comfortable lives on benefits that some people assume refugees are after is far distant from reality
Don’t get me wrong, he is extremely grateful for the refuge Britain has given him, that’s without question. But when homelessness and mental health issues are rife, and many struggle to feed themselves and their families, the comfortable lives on benefits that some people assume refugees are after is far distant from reality. The narrative is that there is a humanitarian crisis abroad, but in reality there is also a humanitarian crisis on our doorstep.
All refugees share the same structural barrier to employment: they do not fit into traditional recruitment processes. This results in disproportionately high levels of unemployment. From my experience, despite being desperate to work, they are likely to be long-term welfare dependent. Society needs to do more to find a way to accommodate these people and find routes for them into jobs.
Simply put, there is both a social and economic case to do so: social inclusion and a reduction in welfare. There’s a business case too. When in work, marginalised groups have much larger retention rates than those of the general population.
Marginalised individuals often possess a determination, work ethic and resilience that they have developed due to the difficulties they have faced throughout their lives.
Additionally, refugees have above average education, with the majority having had successful careers in their countries of origin. Businesses need to take advantage of these skills and experiences. I have no doubt that when given more opportunities, refugees wouldn’t just succeed, they’d thrive.

Saharan solidarity: the North African refugees keeping corruption at bay ","Unlike many refugee settlements, where food supplies often end up on the black market or in the hands of politicians, the Bojador camp in Algeria is self-governed by its Sahrawi inhabitants. For ten years the solidarity system has managed to keep corruption largely at bay, Kenza Yousfi investigates how
At eight o’clock on a dusty morning, a rumbling supply truck arrives in the Lamsid district of the Bojador refugee camp. Sinia H’med emerges from a ﬁeld of clay huts and pitched tents, making her way to the barbed wire-enclosed circle where sealed bags are stacked high. She is wrapped in a traditional melhfa and carries a mechanical scale.
This is where food aid is distributed to Sahrawi refugees twice a month. Today’s shipment is for fresh fruits and vegetables; the next will be for grains.
If this were a United Nations-run camp, guards would be out monitoring the goods as official aid workers collect ration cards and diligently pass out bags of food. But Bojador is different. The Sahrawis’ food system is based on solidarity and is part of an informal law of the land that refugees say gives them autonomy and dignity. They appoint local coordinators like Sinia via voice vote, though no formal leadership council exists.
“Our model is based on our own perception of justice: decentralised and participatory,” Sinia explains. She argues that the ration cards used in UN camps are “just a modern technique of humiliation, to make you feel that you are in need”.
Our model is based on our own perception of justice: decentralised and participatory
In the late 1970s, many Sahrawis were forced to ﬂee their native Western Sahara after Mauritania and Morocco invaded the country. The refugees formed self-run communities in Algeria’s south-western Tindouf province. Around 117,000 people live in ﬁve camps in Tindouf, and 40 years later, they still refuse to leave until the UN ﬁnalises a referendum that allows them to choose independence, or integration into Morocco.
The Sahrawi Red Crescent, a humanitarian group, supplies food to Bojador, but its mission is limited to just that. “We are refugees of justice and not of bread,” Nosra Salek, the Sahrawis’ liaison with the group, says about the arrangement. The Red Crescent also teaches refugees how to avoid malnutrition, a problem that acutely afflicts pregnant women and about nine percent of children in the ﬁve camps.
Camp members alone are responsible for rationing out the sacks of grain and produce. In Lamsid district, the task falls to Sinia. She keeps tabs on the community, stays in touch with other refugee leaders, and alerts the Red Crescent if a family moves, so that the supplies are sent to the new quarters. “We know how many members there are in every family by socialising,” she says of the informal community.
That morning, she lingers a while at the food site but eventually wanders away, dropping off her scale and leaving the vegetables boxes unguarded. Around midday, women arrive alone or in groups with empty crates to carry home their hauls. No one checks to make sure they only take their ration of one kilogram for each person in the family.
“If a family is not here at time of delivery, a neighbour will save their rations,” says Darifa, a refugee at the camp. “And if the family stays away for long, their fresh food will be given to anaemic individuals or pregnant women.”
If a family is not here at time of delivery, a neighbour will save their rations
Nguia, a mother of nine, says she doesn’t care “if my neighbour takes 200 grams more than me”. She is more concerned that the food supplies don’t end up on the black market for resale or in the hands of politicians. While that’s common in other refugee camps, the solidarity system has so far managed to keep corruption largely at bay among Sahrawis.
By sunset, Lamsid’s food site is mostly bare, save for a few scattered sack cloths. Darifa calls on children playing nearby with punctured tires to gather the woven bags for future use. A young girl strides quickly toward the clay huts, returning the scale to Sinia. The site will remain empty until the next shipment of bags of grains.

Spare room initiative helps house refugees ","What began as a bid to fill a spare room in Berlin has spiralled into an international template for refugee integration, benefiting around 565 people to date
Bassel Alsheekh Kassem, 29, fled Syria almost a year ago and now lives with fellow web developer Melanie Thewlis and her partner Paul Zubrinich in trendy Kreuzberg.
“We spend our time talking about our cultures and our value systems; we compare them, discuss them and sometimes criticise them,” Kassem said. “In Syria before the war, my life was perfect – financially and socially. Moving to Paul and Mel’s apartment gave me the feeling of having a normal life again.”
Zubrinich explained that they felt compelled to open up their house after hearing that the city would be hosting thousands of refugees, and that they have all benefited as a result. “I’ve learned a lot about Syrian cuisine and culture, for example; their food is awesome and they have a rich history,” he said. “It’s been intense observing the demonisation of refugees in the media and contrasting it with the friendly, gentle man I live with.”
The website, Flüchtlinge Willkommen (Refugees Welcome), was set up by Mareike Geiling, her partner Jonas Kakoschke and friend Golde Ebding. The trio was inundated with expressions of interest after raising funds to host Bakary Conan, a Malian asylum seeker, in their shared house. They have since developed the concept to house refugees across Europe and Canada.

Sustainable safe havens for refugees ","Matt Mellen and Jeya Lorenz propose an idea that could give refugees a more secure future and address other pressing issues
Thousands of refugees remain stranded at Calais. Many more are embarking on treacherous sea voyages to Europe to escape the disasters unfolding in Syria and beyond. Yet despite media portrayals of refugees, which have often been negative, people have taken it upon themselves to help.
According to the Charities Aid Foundation, one in three Britons has contributed in some way to the refugee relief effort, and more than 1.8m households in the UK would offer a refugee a room. People have also driven from all over the country to deliver supplies to Calais, including shelter in the form of caravans and tents.
It is a similar story across the rest of Europe. In Germany, Flüchtlinge Willkommen (Refugees Welcome) has provided an online platform that works like Airbnb, linking people with spare rooms to refugees who need accommodation. It has since spread to eight other European countries, although not yet the UK.
With winter upon us, these temporary forms of shelter are vital for protecting refugees from the cold.
They show that another way of living is possible, practical and desirable
But is there a longer-term, sustainable response to the refugee crisis? One that also fosters meaningful work for UK citizens, rehabilitates degraded farmland, generates a return for ethical investors and demonstrates that we can create a more peaceful, prosperous world?
‘Sustainable safe havens’ is an idea that takes welcoming refugees to the next level by integrating them into a supportive community and offering fulfilling livelihoods. Such an approach could, for example, concurrently tackle the refugee crisis, sustainability issues and youth unemployment by creating a social enterprise that employs young people and refugees to grow food.
Undervalued farmland could be borrowed or rented and transformed into prototype ecological live-and-work communities that produce surplus food. Income could be generated by selling produce, running cafes, courses and events, producing arts and crafts, and showcasing cutting-edge, appropriatescale green technology alongside ecological restoration.
It sounds far-fetched, but this is a proven idea. Eco-villages with social purpose are springing up around the world. In Sólheimar eco-village in Iceland, people with or without special needs live and work together growing food and creating art. In the UK, The Severn Project is a social enterprise run by ex-offenders that generates income from growing salad ingredients. In the process, it helps its employees reintegrate into society. Such a model could be used to help refugees and restore ecological health and community to damaged UK countryside.
A perfect storm of climate change, ecological deterioration and ongoing militarism is driving a global crisis. This will continue until radical systemic change shifts us to a new course. Sustainable safe havens offer a positive alternative to detention, while also showing that another way of living is possible, practical and desirable.
If we can show that people of different nationalities, backgrounds and religions can sustainably live rewarding, creative lives on neglected land in the countryside, arguments claiming that our country is full up, fall flat. We are not in a doomed race to consume our dying world. We can make things better.

Education for Middle Eastern refugees could help save lost generation ","As conflict rages in the Middle East, children are being taken out of school and put to work, but a number of initiatives are now working to reverse the trend
With the world’s focus firmly on the European response to the refugee crisis in recent months, attention has arguably been diverted away from the humanitarian needs of the Middle East itself.
Only a minority of refugees have fled to Europe, with the majority of Syrians travelling across neighbouring borders to Jordan, Turkey and Lebanon. These movements of people have placed considerable pressure on already stretched public services, and children – one of the most vulnerable groups – are being severely affected.
Hundreds of thousands of them are at risk of becoming ill, malnourished, abused and exploited – and for the vast majority, they have no access to education.
A significant proportion of the 13 million children reported by UNICEF as deprived of an education in the Middle East are from Syria. With limited and interrupted education, what does the future hold for these children – and for the future of Syria?
Limited access
The humanitarian needs of the region are complex. Each year, international aid providers struggle to provide resources to this enormous regional diaspora, with donor pledges failing to meet annual strategic response plan targets.
Most recently the UN World Food Programme has had to cut food rations substantially for populations in all refugee-hosting countries. Though rarely highlighted in mainstream media there is undoubtedly a connection between these cuts and the current European migration crisis.
Syrian children in Jordan have access to education within the two main formal refugee camps, but only a small number attend because their parents need them to work to support their families.
Tara Shoham, a researcher with the Emergency Nutrition Network, described how refugees have to compete with the poorest among the local population for access to critical services. After visiting the Zaa’tari camp and the informal tented settlement in Jordan she reported:
“Educational facilities are limited, with many parents in financial difficulty resorting to marrying off their young teenage girls and sending their children to work instead of school.”
The situation is the same in Turkey and Lebanon – increased demands on public services have fractured and overwhelmed systems for refugees and locals alike. Most refugee households are left with no choice but to use their children to support their families, limiting their chances of obtaining an education.
Accessing education is not the only issue. The quality of education has declined as a result of overcrowded classrooms (there are on average 120 children to each teacher in the Zaa’tari camp in Jordan). Not only are Syria’s neighbours dealing with curriculum complexities and cultural barriers, they have had to absorb the influx of refugees into already underfunded education systems.
With only two percent of international humanitarian aid allocated to education, it is hard to see how Syrian refugee children will receive an education.
Positive moves, but not enough
There are a number of positive initiatives taking place to support learning opportunities. In Syria, where there are an estimated two million children out of school or at risk of dropping out, UNICEF has launched the Back to Learning initiative for 2015-16 – aiming to reach more than one million children with education supplies.
In Turkey, the Syrian teacher incentive programme has been scaled up with 5,503 teachers supported monthly to improve the quality of learning for over 175,000 Syrian refugee children.
In Jordan, UNICEF and 20 partners are working on the Makani (My Space) programme, with 128 Makani centres providing alternative education, psychosocial support and life skills already in place and another 93 expected to be in place by the end of 2015.
The private sector is also involved. Pearson, the global educational publisher, is planning to spend £1m to help find solutions for Syria’s refugee education crisis, as well as another £500,000 to support two education centres in Amman designed and run by Save the Children.
According to Save the Children, the long-term impact of Syrian children never returning to school is estimated at 5.4 percent of Syria’s GDP, or £1.5bn. The charity has called on donors to fund the $224m (£148m) the UN estimates is required for the education of Syrian children.
Syria needs its children to build a better future but education is more than just economics – it is about aspiration, hopes and dreams. After the trauma they have gone through Syrian children deserve to dream of new beginnings.

Transforming refugee camps from places of boredom to hubs of innovation ","With many of the world’s refugees finding themselves in ‘temporary’ settlements for decades, researcher Marlen de la Chaux argues that fostering entrepreneurial initiatives in camps could combat the negative consequences that result from years of boredom
Media attention on refugees has focused on chaotic scenes in Europe of late, but it is worth remembering that most of the world’s refugees in fact live in camps in sub-Saharan Africa or the Middle East – and that boredom rather than chaos is the typical routine.
There, they wait in supposedly “temporary” exile until they can safely return home, but many end up spending two decades in camps that in effect become semi-permanent mini-cities. Unsurprisingly, many of these displaced people become weary and frustrated. Crime, alcoholism and drugs often characterise camp life.
My academic research focuses on the dynamics and opportunities of refugee camps, and I believe that policymakers should foster entrepreneurship in refugee camps in order to help turn this cycle of despair into hope and dignity.
Such initiatives could be life-enhancing for millions of people displaced by war, persecution and other man-made events. Currently, however, there is an institutional paralysis that thwarts entrepreneurial initiatives in refugee camps, posing barriers that need to be tackled by governments, NGOs and others.

Menace?
Refugee camps have been founded on the assumption that they are short-term areas of protection. The rules established for camps reflect such assumption, but these rules have not been adjusted to account for the protracted displacement that has developed. The reason is that refugee crises often menace the social stability of host countries. For example, one in five people living in Lebanon is now a Syrian refugee. Since most Syrians are Sunni Muslims, their influx threatens Lebanon’s delicate balance between Shia and Sunni populations.
“At home they were engineers, teachers, doctors. Now all they can do is drink tea to pass the time. It is deeply depressing to watch.”
It is no surprise then that host governments prefer to maintain refugee camps as temporary spaces. Refugees’ legal status usually prevents them from taking up employment, owning property or moving freely, thus stripping them of agency. As an aid worker in Zaatari refugee camp in Jordan told me, speaking of Syrian refugees there: “At home they were engineers, teachers, doctors. Now all they can do is drink tea to pass the time. It is deeply depressing to watch.”
Although camp managers are beginning to recognise the need to move beyond simply providing essentials for the displaced, devising innovative programmes has proven difficult.
Firstly, camps develop unpredictably. Without warning, thousands of refugees may cross neighbouring borders to safety within a few hours and providing for the newcomers takes priority, as it should. Secondly, camps are run on aid donations, meaning that planning is only possible for the short term. Finally, camp managers strike a delicate balance between the de facto semi-permanence of many refugee camps and host communities’ expectation that the camps be temporary.
That last factor is very significant: while there are cafes, barbershops and repair services in a camp like Zaatari, such activity remains a grey area because it contradicts the supposed transience underlying the camp concept. This creates obstacles to the broader entrepreneurship needed in such camps.
It means there is a lack of functioning supply that would otherwise evolve in demand-driven markets. There are inefficient legal and political systems regulating entrepreneurial activity and there is insufficient infrastructure which connects entrepreneurs to information, financial capital and customers.

Planning
Research I conducted into this issue leads us to propose a few solutions. For a start, cash-based aid programs and partnerships with micro-lending institutions, as cautiously piloted in a handful of camps, would help refugees launch businesses. There should also be clearer policies on how refugee-camp entrepreneurs engage with host communities in order to reduce uncertainty for both parties.
“In Jordan’s Zaatari camp, refugees developed an informal postal system and rewired the electricity infrastructure to run their businesses more effectively.”
Host countries, meanwhile, could outsource some tasks to refugees in order to create employment opportunities within refugee camps. In addition, urban-planning strategies in camps would improve infrastructure in order to link entrepreneurs, resources and customers in these mini-cities. For example, in Jordan’s Zaatari camp, refugees developed an informal postal system and rewired the electricity infrastructure to run their businesses more effectively. Camp managers are now collaborating with urban architects to formalise these initiatives.
And most camps are fairly small: although some sprawling camps such as Dadaab in Kenya or Zaatari in Jordan are home to hundreds of thousands of refugees, the United Nations High Commission for Refugees says the 2012 mean population size of camps was 11,400 people. So projects such as improving infrastructure are manageable.

Empowerment
There could also be a role for business incubation and acceleration spaces in refugee camps as a venue for knowledge exchange and a safe place to pilot entrepreneurial ideas. Such innovation hubs have already proved successful in fostering technology-based ventures in Nairobi and other cities in Africa.
“Policymakers should foster entrepreneurship in refugee camps in order to help turn this cycle of despair into hope and dignity.”
Another idea is to let refugees decide themselves what they want their camp to look like. Although elected refugee delegates represent the camp population to camp managers, decisions of how the camp should be run are made in offices far away. Refugees’ entrepreneurial initiative demonstrates their ability to improve the situation in camps. There may be many more such ideas and initiatives if refugees are given more of a say.
Attention paid to refugees will surely ebb and flow over coming months and years, spiking when events become dramatic or tragic. Yet the everyday life of millions of people who live for decades in refugee camps also deserves the world’s attention. Helping many of these people through entrepreneurship is a policy worth pursuing.

Helping refugees integrate through language learning ","How can countries help refugees integrate? The question looms large in Europe, which is experiencing a refugee crisis many are calling the biggest since World War II. In Ireland one organisation believes communication could be the answer
Under EU law, migrants seeking refugee status are entitled to food and housing while their cases are reviewed, but covering these rights does not always address the isolation and trauma that asylum seekers can experience after going through the ordeal of migration. While governments struggle to cope with the increased demand on resources, small independent organisations are stepping in to help refugees integrate in their host communities.
An unusual pioneer in inclusion has been the independent, non-governmental volunteer centre Third Age, based in Ireland. Third Age began in the 1980s as an innovative community hub for the elderly, offering voluntary services, such as a listening helpline, and social activities all built around celebrating the “third age of life.”
“We know that it’s having an impact – for parents, it means being able to help their children with homework. For others, it’s helping make them more employable in Ireland.”
For many years, Third Age catered primarily to the needs of seniors and retirees, but by 2006 its founder Mary Nally had noticed a change in the demographics of her village. Between 2004-2007, Ireland experienced a steep increase in immigration, with thousands of international newcomers joining communities in every town and village in Ireland. Nally cites an encounter with a young Polish mother in a supermarket; when Nally saw that the distressed woman could not read the packaging, she recognised this as another form of isolation.
“I sat down with members of our vibrant, elderly volunteer force, and we decided that we would welcome these people into our organisation,” Nally recounts. “By teaching them conversational English, perhaps we could help immigrants to integrate into the community.”
Calling itself Fáilte Isteach (which translates to “welcome in” in Gaelic), the English teaching program spread by word-of-mouth and within a year was rolled out to new communities.

Almost ten years after its founding, the program counts 72 branches nationally, drawing on over 600 trained volunteers, 80 percent of whom are elderly. The impact is significant, with over 2,000 migrants attending classes in the various national centres every week. As the refugee crisis in greater Europe has grown, so have the numbers fleeing to Ireland, and Fáilte Isteach is increasingly becoming a key support network for the communities it operates in.
“Over 2,000 migrants attend classes in the various national centres every week.”
“We know that it’s having an impact in many ways. For parents, it means being able to help their children with homework. For others, it’s helping make them more employable in Ireland,” says Nally. Third Age has received both local and international recognition for its work, with funding awards from Social Entrepreneurs Ireland, the Arthur Guinness Fund and others. In 2009, Nally received funding and strategic support through a global partnership with Boehringer-Ingelheim.
For now, Third Age and its programs remain based in Ireland, but international expansion is not off the table. Earlier in 2015, Nally spoke at the Innovate to Restart conference in Italy and met with several social cooperatives, including Milan-based Piccolo Principe, which expressed interest in piloting a program based on the Fáilte Isteach model. Asked whether she could imagine that Third Age and Fáilte Isteach could expand abroad in the near future, Nally is optimistic: “We would love to share what we have learnt,” she says.

How public opinion on the refugee crisis is shifting – and for the better ","Desperate people are still arriving on Europe’s borders and on its shores, as they have been for months and years. But now the public’s reaction is changing, says Hannah Jones
The tone of the public’s reaction is shifting fast to those arriving on Europe’s borders. We’re starting to hear less about the “threat” posed by these people and more about the “unbearable” sight of a three-year-old boy washed up, dead, on the shore of Turkey, and everything it implies.
Many European leaders continue to say that taking in more refugees will not solve this crisis, but they appear to be out of step with this changing public feeling.
Increasing numbers of people across Europe are offering support to displaced people in large and small ways. They are signing online petitions, sending money, visiting the camps in Calais, joining protests, and even offering shelter in their own homes.
Going too far
Two years ago, Britain’s coalition government ramped up its attempts to talk “tough” on migration. As part of a group of researchers, I have been working since then to identify the effects of this tough rhetoric on public opinion and on people’s lives.
Government advisers told us that the British public simply will not listen to facts and figures on immigration; that the public is worried that immigration is a threat, and the government has to be seen to be acting on that threat.
“Tougher measures to control migration do not reassure people – in fact, such measures can make them more fearful.”
But what our research found is that rhetoric about ever-tougher measures to control migration does not reassure people – in fact, whatever people’s position on immigration, such measures can make them more fearful.
People who see migration as a threat told us they see government publicity as pure theatre. It can never be tough enough; there can never be enough fences or guards. People who feel targeted by measures to control immigration, whether they are immigrants or not, feel increasingly unwelcome, excluded, and unable to function normally in their own homes.
We also found that the tough rhetoric and action by the government – promising to control “swarms” of people, publicising raids and enforcement measures – have led to increasingly vocal activism opposing them.
The “Go Home” vans and public raids seen in Britain over the summer of 2013 mobilised people to gather both in the streets and online to counter the UK’s Home Office enforcement, and to show solidarity with the people affected.
This drew in people who had not been active in politics before, for example the BritCits group, which was organised to support British citizens with non-EU partners threatened with separation by new immigration rules.
Stirred into action
Now, we are seeing much more vivid pictures of the mass movement of people that bring home just what it means. The focus is back on borders, and not on enforcement on our streets.
But this stage of the crisis has stirred a similar impulse to the one we identified in our research. Across Europe, ordinary people are offering their homes, their money, their time, and their support to those in desperate need. It seems that it has taken the unbearable image of Aylan Kurdi – the three-year-old boy who drowned – to have this recognised as a public outcry.
But desperate images of people drowning or close to drowning – including other children – have been out there for a some time. The figures for the numbers of people drowned trying to seek shelter in Europe were well known.
“Whatever it’s taken to get here, this is beginning to feel like a turning point.”
There are constant reminders that, compared to the number of displaced people in the world as a whole, the numbers trying to enter the UK are tiny. And people across the UK were responding to this with both feeling and action.
This crisis is not new. For years, people have been dying while crossing borders and seeking sanctuary. They have been living in desperate, destitute conditions in the UK and other “advanced countries” after they are refused asylum. They have been held without charge for indefinite periods in the prison-like conditions of detention centres, unable to return to their country of origin but unable to remain in their “host” country too.
And for years, the bulk of the media, most politicians, and a majority of the public have ignored these stories. But whatever it’s taken to get here, this is beginning to feel like a turning point.

On 1 September, 20,000 people took to the streets of Vienna to demonstrate their support for refugees, just days after a similar march in Dresden. On 12 September tens of thousands of people marched through London for a Solidarity with Refugees event. And on the morning of 3 September, a petition on the UK parliament website hit 100,000 signatures, enough to require a parliamentary debate on increasing the number of people granted refuge in the UK. A few hours later, it was at nearly 200,000 and now has more than 400,000.
What happens next depends on ordinary people’s empathy and will to action – and on the courage and ethics of our political leaders.

Five ways ordinary people are helping refugees in Calais ","As the humanitarian crisis in Calais grows, the media is increasingly dominated with tales of savagery and menace in the refugee camps. But the reality couldn’t be further from the truth, say the many ordinary UK citizens who are taking positive action
The refugee crisis in Calais is escalating rapidly. Around 5,000 refugees are camped out in the northern port town in France, with as many as 150 arriving every day. Nicknamed the ‘Jungle’, conditions at the camp are poor, and authorities are faced with the dilemma of addressing a growing humanitarian crisis without making conditions attractive enough to encourage newcomers.
Pay attention to the mainstream press and you’d be forgiven for thinking the Jungle is awash with violence and thievery, perpetuated by those looking to take advantage of Britain’s generous welfare system. Indeed, according to a YouGov poll, 64% of Londoners think easily-obtainable benefits are the main reason for this exodus to England.
But far from being driven by economic migrants, this crisis is largely about refugees fleeing dictatorial oppression, war and religious extremism – by the end of July this year 62% of those who had reached Europe by boat were from Syria, Eritrea and Afghanistan. Speak to the individuals at Calais themselves, and most will say they want a job, not handouts. Furthermore, speak to those that have visited the camp and they’ll tell you that the so-called ‘Jungle’ is not a place of crime and danger, but a peaceful place of tolerance, solidarity and sharing.
“Speak to the individuals at Calais and most will say they want a job, not handouts.”
Diane Fotheringham, a civilian fundraiser from Glasgow, told The Huffington Post: “It’s a place that’s relaxed and so full of laughter. The only squabbling we saw was kids wanting one of the footballs that we had brought. There was no tension, I’ve rarely felt less threatened in my life.”
This is a sentiment echoed by many charity organisations that have stepped in to help those at the very heart of the crisis – the refugees themselves. But it’s not just charities and official organisations that are taking action; ordinary people from around the UK – tired of waiting for a political solution to this state of emergency – are getting involved to help those that are in need.
People to People Solidarity
People to People Solidarity is a Facebook-centric group that acts as a central hub for those wanting to take practical action in Calais. Here, UK Facebook users can share information and organise trip logistics, with an events stream dedicated to upcoming humanitarian journeys to the Jungle from all corners of the country. Personal, political and religious discussion is discouraged to make space for constructive information sharing, such as the most needed supplies on the ground and the locations of particularly vulnerable refugees who need the most urgent assistance.
Bikes Beyond Borders
Cycling offers a sense of freedom, mobility and self-sustainability, and for many people living in the camp a bicycle is an invaluable asset, improving access to basic facilities, many of which are over an hour’s walk away. Bikes Beyond Borders was started by a group of cycle-loving friends who want to help the humanitarian situation by donating bikes and other provisions to the Jungle’s refugees. The group has organised a number of rides from London to Calais across the August bank holiday weekend to get bikes to the camp, but is also looking for support vehicles, general donations and words of encouragement to help along the way.
Jungle Books

Set up by British teacher Mary Jones, Jungle Books (or ‘Livres de la jungle’ in French) is a well-stocked library nestled on the edge of the camp. Just one of the essential services provided at the site on a voluntary basis, the library stocks over 200 books and acts as a support to the camp’s school, where a daily timetable of classes is underway. Speaking to Publishing Perspectives, Jones said: “Many people here are well-educated – they want to get on and they want books that will help them read and write English, apply for jobs, fill-in forms.”

Increasingly horrified at the “diabolical conditions” forced upon migrants and refugees – many of which are orphaned children and pregnant women – Diane Fotheringham packed a van full of clothes, food, sleeping bags, toiletries and other goods, and drove 500 miles from her Glasgow home to distribute provisions at the camp. Speaking to The Huffington Post, Fotheringham said: “We wanted to show the people living in the Calais camps that people in Britain do care.” Indeed, her crowdfunding page was set up with a goal of £500 – at the time of writing the amount raised stands at £4,500.

What started as a documentary-filmmaking mission by travel blogger Jaz O’Hara has swiftly turned into one of the biggest awareness-raising campaigns the Calais refugee crisis has seen to date, attracting 25,000 Facebook likes since the beginning of August alone. Visiting Calais on a weekly basis, O’Hara and her friends meet with those that call the Jungle their (temporary) home, and document the stories of real people at the heart of the issue through colourful Instagram photos and moving stories shared on Facebook. O’Hara aimed to raise £1,000 to provide food, clothing and shelter to those she met, but her crowdfunding efforts have since raised more than £57,000."

Refugee camp in Nepal adopts eco ethos ","A Bhutanese refugee camp in Damak, Nepal is giving its displaced inhabitants a brighter future thanks to green investment
From the outside, the Bhutanese refugee camp in Damak looks like a traditional Nepalese village. It’s surrounded by a thick jungle, and a sea of bamboo structures mingle with trees, making the camp ‘invisible’ from the nearby highway. What is remarkable about this Bhutanese settlement is how little it resembles the refugee camp of our imagination. It almost operates like an ad hoc sustainable village.
If it weren’t for a UN refugee agency banner, you would never think that you had just entered a place usually associated with rows of tents sheltering thousands of men, women and children queuing for aid handouts.
Here, from bamboo structures to solar lighting, several organisations have been building sustainable, eco-friendly projects that respond to refugees needs.
“Our family has had a very painful past. When the camps were first created, life was difficult. We are trying to resettle in Australia now, but living conditions here have improved a lot in the last couple of years,” a 60-year-old refugee told me as I explored the narrow alleys of this ‘mini-Bhutan’. I did a quick calculation and realised that he and his wife had been living in the refugee camp for more than 20 years.
“If it weren’t for a UN refugee agency banner, you would never think that you had just entered a place usually associated with rows of tents and queues for aid handouts.”
Situated between the emerging superpowers of India and China, the isolated Buddhist kingdom of Bhutan, hailed by some as ‘the last Shangri-La’, has generated one of the highest numbers of refugees in the world in proportion to its population. Little did I know that behind its gross national happiness index lies the story of an inter-ethnic conflict which forced more than 100,000 refugees – almost one seventh of Bhutan’s total population – to seek asylum in Nepal.
When we hear of Syrian refugees in Lebanon’s Bekaa Valley struggling amid a harsh winter, or of the Nigerian refugee crisis, the orderly accommodations of this Bhutanese refugee camp truly seem to be an exception to the rule. The site has gradually been ‘upgraded’ as various organisations started linking green and environmentally sustainable projects to issues of development and livelihood.
Susmita, a 35-year-old refugee shared that until five years ago there was no lighting; after sunset the camp would shroud in darkness. Refugees were forced to use a minimum of 1 litre of kerosene a month just to light their rooms. Simple activities such as studying for children were difficult; visiting the toilet and collecting water dangerous, particularly for women and girls.
As part of the overall improvement of living conditions, more than 176 street solar lights have been installed “raising security and comfort standards for refugees”, Santosh Shrestha, representative of solar company Suryodaya Urja explained.
The company set up the renewable energy infrastructure and trained refugees to independently maintain the system. Most Bhutanese have not had any paid work since living in the refugee camp, but the project provides a degree of ‘green-job skills’ suitable for future employment after possible resettlement – a prospect that looks increasingly likely. In 2007 a total of 107,807 Bhutanese refugees were registered in Nepal, following the implementation of a major third-country resettlement programme. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) estimates that less than 10,000 refugees will be left in the camps by the end of 2016.
Walking around the bamboo huts I notice several reflectors that look like the remains of an extraterrestrial spacecraft. I was later told that the camp is home to the world’s largest solar cooking project. The Vajra Foundation supplied and installed about 7,000 solar cookers, benefiting the 25,000 Bhutanese refugees who are currently living in two camps.
“When we started distributing solar cookers there was a kerosene shortage in the camp. Today, refugees still use them, although less. We took this idea from similar projects which were set up in camps across Africa,” Dor Bahandur Bhandari, vice chairman of the Vajra Foundation told me.

Since refugees usually don’t work during the day when the sun is high, they are able to cook dinner in advance without having to spend money on gas or kerosene. Because it uses no fuel and costs nothing to operate, solar cooking is useful in refugee camps where people are housed closely together, and the danger of accidental fires is high. Suraj, a man in his 30s, told me of the several fire breakouts which displaced hundreds of Bhutanese refugees and destroyed their huts.
Finding a home away from home is challenging for most refugees. But in this microcosm, carrying out daily activities is relatively easy; you see women fetching water and hear children repeating the alphabet from their classrooms. Elders told me that the quality of public health and education has been adversely affected by the departure of skilled refugee workers who were resettled. Yet you can still see youngsters running home gardening projects that help the community to break the dependency on donor aid and external assistance to meet its daily food needs.
Most of the camp is built in bamboo available locally in the southern part of Nepal; a highly renewable resource which has long been common in Asia and the South Pacific. From schools to huts, the bamboo structures prove just how durable, eco-friendly and aesthetically pleasing the perennial evergreen plant can be.
Over the years, I visited several camps in both Asia and the Middle East, where degradation of resources and the environmental concerns that affected refugees were largely ignored. Most of the 50 million refugees, asylum-seekers and internally displaced people worldwide are living in appalling conditions with severe restrictions on their freedom of movement and inadequate access to basic services including health, education, water and sanitation. Even though the majority of Bhutanese refugees dream of going back home or of being resettled, their current living conditions in Nepal allow them to live in a secure and peaceful environment."

We can do more for Syria: open our homes to refugees ","The government announced in January that it would welcome a small number of the most vulnerable Syrian refugees to Britain. This is not enough, says Mike Levy, who is calling for a national effort to take 10,000 refugees into our homes
The Syrian situation has been described as the worst refugee crisis since the second world war. More than two million men, women and children are languishing in hastily erected camps in neighbouring Lebanon, Turkey and Jordan. More than half are children and vulnerable women.
The British government has pledged £600m to aid the refugees – making it the second largest bilateral donor worldwide. Something to be proud of, but is it enough? In late January, the government also performed a U-turn on its decision not to host refugees and said it would allow a limited number of the most vulnerable from the Syrian conflict into Britain. Although no quota has been announced, a figure of up to 500 has been mooted.
But is there more that each and every one of us could do? One answer may be to offer our own homes.
In December 2013, I gave a lecture at Limmud, the national learning conference for Jewish people, where I talked about the nationwide response to the second world war refugee crisis. A member of the audience asked: “Why don’t we do the same today – offer our homes as a temporary refuge for Syrian refugees?” It struck me as a good idea. A few days later, I gathered a group of friends in Cambridge and the 10,000 Homes for Syrian Refugees campaign was born.
Our inspiration came from the Kindertransport rescue of 1938-39. Answering the need to rescue the Jewish children of Nazi-occupied Europe, volunteers from all over Britain came forward to offer homes to these children, as well as training places, help with medical needs, social clubs, canteens and befriending schemes. This was all in an age before social services and free healthcare.
“To us, it’s clear that the British people are ready to take action as their grandparents did 75 years ago”
The idea now is to galvanise the natural goodwill of British people and ask them to emulate the families who offered their homes in 1939, and in doing so, add another notch of pressure on the government. Already, Germany has taken in 11,000 refugees from Syria as part of the UN’s international resettlement programme, which aims to bring to Europe the most vulnerable refugees: mothers with children, the old and disabled; women in physical danger. What the British government announced in January is a good start, but nowhere near a large enough response to what is a catastrophic need.
We are not an NGO or any kind of authority; all we are is a group of concerned citizens. The logistics of choosing which refugees to send to Britain and the arrangements for getting them here will be the responsibility of the British government working with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), while initial medical, psychological and welfare support will be in the hands of local authorities, social services and others.
But what we the British people can offer are homes; a temporary place of refuge. If we can collect offers of up to 10,000 homes for the Syrian refugees, the list of those willing to offer a home will be forwarded to the appropriate authorities. It will then be up to these bodies to liaise with potential home-givers.
Already the campaign has been receiving offers of help: “I have a large empty house and am willing to look after up to 12 refugees,” states one widowed lady. “We have a spare room and would be happy to take in a refugee from Syria,” say an elderly couple. To us, it’s clear that the British people, with their natural generosity of spirit once called upon, are ready to take action as their grandparents did 75 years ago.
Though we have little power to change policy, as homeowners we are at least at the end of a long supply chain of care. Our message is a simple one: “We have a home.”

A dance of hope for child refugees in Middle East ","A groundbreaking social project is using the art of capoeira to coax shell-shocked and vulnerable children out from behind their painful memories and towards empowerment and hope
For young people growing up in refugee camps in the midst of the civil war in Syria, the occupied Palestinian territories, or in post-war Iraq, life holds challenges that few of us can truly imagine.
The camps offer tragic examples of what the stresses of instability, isolation and an uncertain future can do to a community – particularly young people. Aggression, violence, hyperactivity, depression and bedwetting are among the psychosocial symptoms commonly reported in the communities where the charity Bidna Capoeira works.
“These desperately disadvantaged people can be hard to help,” executive director Ummul Choudhury tells Positive News. “Cultural sensitivities are high, unemployment is rife and poverty is normal. Young people with nothing to do, who feel unsafe, are vulnerable to drugs, crime and xenophobia. In such environments, interventions are difficult to sustain.”
Refugee camps are cramped, with families of ten or more living in just a few rooms. Getting work permits can be impossible and families come under unbelievable stress. Domestic violence is common, and violence between young people is widespread, with few neutral, youth-friendly spaces for them to come together or discuss their problems.
Bidna Capoeira realises it is these children who need the help most. The charity teaches capoeira, an Afro-Brazilian art form that combines dance, music, sport and play, to groups of children. It has no winner or loser and is thought to originate from African slaves who were put to work in Brazil in the sixteenth century by Portuguese colonists. They practiced their battle moves in preparation for an uprising against their oppressors, but whenever questioned, simply said they were dancing.
Children pair up for the sessions, which are taught in a social circle called a roda. To a backdrop of instruments and singing, they dance with each other, from simple steps to complex, fast-paced moves.
“It is impossible not to see the transformation of the young people involved”
As well as teaching children capoeria itself, the sessions offer a space for them to talk about issues they are dealing with – some ongoing, while others may arise there and then – ranging from gender awareness, to environmental issues or problems around discipline and anger. The instructors are trained to deal with such issues, and councillors are also brought in.
Now funded by a mixture of grants, donations, fundraising and corporate partnerships, Bidna Capoeira began with a project in Damascus in 2007. It has since run social capoeira programmes in safe houses, with refugees, in juvenile reformatory centres and with other marginalised children and young people, with partners including UNICEF, Red Crescent, Save the Children and the Brazilian embassy.
In the past six years, more than 7,000 children and young people have benefited from social capoeira in Syria alone as a result of the charity’s work.
Tarek Alsaleh, programme director and founder, explains: “Capoeira requires the participation of everyone, building a sense of community and of belonging. Our capoeira workshops teach not only physical movements but also the co-operative philosophy of capoeira, teaching life skills about communication, co-operation, anger management, responsibility and respect.”
The results have been staggering. According to Tarek, it is “impossible not to see” the transformation of the young people involved, in attitude, outlook and behaviour.
“These are children that arrive on the first day of class shy and hesitant to participate. After a few classes they are smiling, arriving early to classes, and participating with much more eagerness. Aggressive children who came into the class pushing and shoving and having a difficult time respecting the space of others, have learned to effectively channel their anger and learn to cope with the stresses of everyday life through capoeira.”
Some of the children have undergone particularly significant changes since becoming involved. Ummul tells the story of one child: “Ten-year-old Sara had severe behavioural problems, suffered from selective mutism and was extremely withdrawn. She used to sit and watch on the edges of the capoeira group. Our organiser said she had never participated in any activity before capoeira came to the camp. Suddenly, I saw her sitting next to the trainer, clapping and singing.
Salwa, a 12-year-old schoolgirl from Palestine describes how she “met new people and learned so many things from capoeira,” such as “how to love and respect each other.”
“Since capoeira came, life started to be beautiful,” adds Mariam, a nine-year-old from the Al Tanf Refugee Camp in Syria.
Tarek and Ummul’s vision is to create a social capoeira movement – they believe it has the potential to transform the lives of thousands more young people. Their central London office will support programmes in Palestine and Syria, as well as Syrian refugees in Lebanon and Jordan, and they also plan to expand their programmes in sub-Saharan Africa, as well as run a pilot programme in Kenya. At their office in Ramallah, Palestine, they are equipping local capoeira trainers with the skills they need to take the project forward themselves.
“Children and young people need to have safe places where they can play, express themselves, relieve their stress, and gain the tools they need,” says Tarek. “They need this not only to survive, but to thrive.”"

Refugee Wins Award for Radio Programme ","A 16-year-old Congolese boy has been awarded the annual International Children’s Peace Prize, for producing a radio programme for children in a Tanzanian refugee camp.
Baruani Ndume was handed his award by Kenyan Nobel Peace laureate Wangari Maathai during the ceremony in the Netherlands. Guests included Dutch Prime Minister Jan Peter Balkenende and UNHCR Regional Representative for Western Europe Wilbert van Hˆvell.
The prize, organized by the Dutch foundation, KidsRights, is awarded to a child “whose courageous or otherwise remarkable acts have made a difference in countering problems which affect children around the world.” It comes with a cash prize of 100,000 euros to be spent on projects related to his work.
The jury found that Ndume, programme co-ordinator for the ‘Children for Children’ show in Tanzania’s Lugufu Refugee Camp, had, “under the most impossible circumstances … chosen to champion the rights of other children.”
The radio progamme focuses on education for young people with difficulties, as well as family reunification. It has helped parents in the Democratic Republic of the Congo trace children they were separated from. “Boys and girls with stories similar to mine could not easily express themselves and were keeping their pain inside,” Ndume said. “Our radio programme makes them feel less alone.”
Ndume was born in the South Kivu province. His father died when he was four, while his mother and younger brother were murdered when conflict erupted once more in the region in 1998. Soldiers herded the family and other villagers into a house before burning it. “As I was small, I managed to escape through a little hole in the wall,” he recalled.
Ndume kept his past a secret, until one day last year. “I approached the UNHCR partner organisation World Vision, which was running a radio programme called ‘Child Voice Out’. I was selected among other refugee children and started as a young journalist for this programme broadcast every Sunday,” he explained. “I hope to go to university one day and become a journalist,” he added.

Library of Things: borrow power tools, ukuleles, and ice cream makers alongside books ","A library in south London is believed to be the first in the UK to be hosting a ‘library of things’, a project that loans items such as drills, pressure washers and ukuleles at affordable rates
After a crowdfunding campaign supported by almost 300 local residents, a library in Crystal Palace, south London, has launched a ‘library of things’: a collection of 50 items that people can borrow at affordable, daily rates.
The collection of items – which is open now following a launch party at the weekend – is on display at Upper Norwood Library Hub. An ice cream maker, carpet cleaner, lawn mower, pressure washer and a ukulele are among the items proving most popular so far.
It is a project by Library of Things, a social enterprise based around the so-called sharing economy, which started in nearby West Norwood in 2014. Prices range from £1 per day for hand tools and £5 per day for a bread machine, to £20 per day for a carpet cleaner, with discounts available for regular borrowers and people who are less able to pay.
Robert, a dad who lives nearby, said: “I’m going to borrow the hand sander to do up an old chest of drawers over the weekend, and the kids can borrow a kite and ukulele. It’s great – we don’t have space to store this stuff at home.”
Borrowers can also attend practical skill-sharing events including mending meet-ups, repair parties and DIY classes. People can volunteer their time to become a ‘host’, ‘thing fixer’, ‘ambassador’ or ‘skill sharer’, receiving discounted borrowing and training sessions in exchange.
It’s great – we don’t have space to store this stuff at home
Volunteer Stef, who is on a sabbatical from a career in healthcare, said: “I’m volunteering here because I want to get involved in my community and make new connections.”
The team behind Crystal Palace Library of Things crowdfunded £9,375 from 291 people and organisations, including the Mayor of London and local and national businesses, as well as would-be local borrowers.
The project is being delivered by three partner organisations: Crystal Palace Transition Town, a grassroots network that works on local sustainable projects; Upper Norwood Library Hub; and the Library of Things social enterprise.

“I can already see how this has the potential to become part of people’s lives,” said Joe Duggan, co-chair of Crystal Palace Transition Town. “People can pop into the library for a cuppa, borrow a book, use the computer, and now hire all sorts of useful things at affordable rates.”
Margaret Adjaye, co-director of Upper Norwood Library Hub, noted that the Library of Things had already attracted more visitors and activity to the library. “It will complement the other activities we’ve started here,” she said. “A bike rental project, a programme of learning and wellbeing events for local people young and old, a coffee shop, and an upcoming fortnight of community theatre and comedy called Attic Arts Club.”

The Library of Things social enterprise, which is led by an all-women director team, recently completed an 18-month ‘demonstrator’ site in nearby West Norwood. They sourced high-quality items at a discount from manufacturers such as Bosch and cleaning technology company Karcher and loaned the items more than 2,500 times to 850 borrowers. Crystal Palace is the first of 10 borrowing sites planned for shared spaces across the capital over the next three years.
“We’ve had interest from libraries, makerspaces, cafes, shared workspaces, housing associations and property developers looking to make London life more affordable and socially rewarding for people,” said co-director Rebecca Trevalyan. “We plan to adapt Library of Things to all sorts of communities – and a library, as an open, inclusive space on a high street – is a great place to start.”

Photographs capture kindness shown during emergencies in London and Manchester last year ","Images by British portrait and fashion photographer Rankin profile British Red Cross volunteers who supported on the frontline of UK terror attacks and Grenfell Tower fire in 2017
Renowned photographer Rankin has captured the kindness shown by British Red Cross volunteers who helped in last year’s emergencies in London and Manchester. Terror attacks in the UK, including the Manchester Arena bombing in May 2017 and the Grenfell Tower fire in June 2017, led to one of the largest humanitarian responses by the British Red Cross in the UK since the second world war.
Images from the photoshoot have been released by the charity to help mark Red Cross Week (6-12 May).
In the aftermath of the terror attacks and the Grenfell Tower fire, more than 1,000 British Red Cross volunteers worked alongside the emergency services and with local communities. They provided first aid at the scene; gave emotional and practical support at rest centres; helped people at friends and family centres who were bereaved or searching for missing loved ones; managed a 24-hour support line; and sorted through 200 tons of items donated by the British public.
“The horrific events in Manchester and London last summer were truly shocking for our nation,” said Zoë Abrams, executive director at the British Red Cross. “But even during these most terrible of times we also saw the extraordinary power of human kindness as the country came together to help in any way they could.”
Laszlo Kelemen, 33, an intensive care practitioner from London, has been a Red Cross volunteer since he was 15, starting in his home country of Romania, before joining the British Red Cross two years ago. He was part of the charity’s response to the London Bridge attack, Grenfell Tower Fire and Finsbury Park attack, providing psychosocial support to those affected.
Laszlo said: “The Red Cross is part of who I am. Before last summer I felt like someone who just lived in London but now I feel that I’m part of this city because I was able to help. I’ve experienced its very worst but also its best.”
Even during these most terrible of times we also saw the extraordinary power of human kindness as the country came together to help in any way they could
Julia Reason from Warrington, Cheshire, has volunteered with the British Red Cross for more than eight years. Following the Manchester Arena attack, she was deployed to Oldham hospital to help staff who needed respite. She also provided emotional support to people at the memorial that took place in memory of the victims in the city centre. In June, Julia travelled to London to support the families who had been affected by the fire at Grenfell Tower.

She said: “I first heard about the Manchester Arena attack whilst I was watching TV. When something terrible like that happens, especially when it’s so close to home, you just want to do anything you can to help.
“The events of last year have had a lasting impact on me. But as a volunteer for the British Red Cross we’re privileged to be able to help people when they need it most, and support them through emergencies like these.”

Sairah and Hannah Merchant, first aid volunteers from Kent
This mother and daughter team travelled to London last June to help with the response to the Grenfell Tower fire. They used to live in Bayswater and knew the neighbourhood well, so felt compelled to help when the British Red Cross put a call out for volunteers. It was 19-year-old Hannah’s first emergency since signing up as a volunteer. Sairah is now training to become a paramedic after becoming passionate about emergency response.
Sairah said: “We used to live not too far from Grenfell. My kids used to go to the school nearby and we still have friends in the area. When we were watching what happened on the news it all felt so personal to us. There was no question that we wanted to go and help. Mostly we provided psychosocial support and helped with minor injuries and cuts and bruises, but many people just needed a listening ear. It was an extremely difficult time, and we just tried to help in any way that we could.”
Farheen Chaudhry, refugee support and emergency response volunteer from Paddington, London
Farheen has been volunteering for the British Red Cross for over two years. When she signed up she couldn’t have anticipated that her neighbourhood would experience an emergency like the Grenfell Tower fire. Farheen volunteered for several weeks, supporting with local outreach work as part of the British Red Cross response to the fire.
She said: “I can see the tower from my living room window. When I opened the blinds on the morning of the fire, it was surreal. I could see that the tower was on fire, and that there was smoke, and helicopters circling overhead. Straight away I knew that this was going to be a huge emergency as I had worked in disaster and emergency zones before and understood the implications.
“Meeting people who had lost someone in the fire, or who had seen what happened up close, was the most emotionally taxing part. I just wanted to help in some small way and I often wished that I could have done more. I have always felt that I just could not do enough.”
Rukia Shepherd, emergency response volunteer from Bury in Manchester
Mother-of-three and teaching assistant Rukia felt compelled to support her fellow Mancunians after hearing the news of the attack on Manchester Arena. Some pupils at the Manchester school where she works were supposed to have been at the concert, and a student teacher had been there with her young daughter. Rukia was deployed to Oldham hospital to provide psychosocial support to the relatives of people who died. She then went to support members of the public at St Ann’s Square, the space set up for mourners at the heart of the city.
“Nothing prepares you for a scene like the one at Oldham hospital,” she said. “No one spoke: the silence was deafening. Slowly we began to provide comfort and reassurance to those who needed it. It wasn’t just families and friends; it was the hospital staff too. It was very sombre in that room. It’s something that stays with you.
“The space at St Ann’s Square was so surreal, it was so peaceful but the city just carried on around us in a strange way. It was like an invisible wall; you felt like you left the entire world once you were in that space.
“In that space there was strength, kindness, and most of all humanity – which is what I believe in most. I’d never experienced that feeling so strongly before. Everyone was reunited, to regroup and resolve.”

Two weeks later Rukia travelled to London to support families who had been affected by the tragic fire at Grenfell Tower.
Marilyn and Derek Williams, emergency response volunteers from Horsham, West Sussex
In 2019, Marilyn and Derek will have been married for 50 years. They have been volunteering for the British Red Cross for 25 years and did approximately 15 shifts in the immediate aftermath of the Grenfell Tower fire, helping provide support to people within the community and their fellow volunteers. They also carried out outreach work with NHS teams, visiting many of the bereaved and members the public who were affected by the fire.
Derek said: “Nothing could ever really prepare you for something like the fire at Grenfell Tower. It was probably the most demanding and intense situations that we have ever been involved in, in the 25 years we have been volunteering for the British Red Cross.”
“There must be hundreds of British Red Cross volunteers who have done extraordinary things over the 150 years or so that it’s been around,” added Marilyn. “It is a privilege for us to do the things that we do, and to be part of this great movement.”
Elaine Meakin, community connector from Fife in Scotland
Elaine Meakin had been working for the British Red Cross for just two months when she responded to the call for emergency response volunteers and headed to London from Scotland to help those affected by the Grenfell Tower fire.
Elaine said: “As soon as we got off the train, the tower was there. I just couldn’t take it in. Walking to the rest centre, there were all the tributes and messages. It was just really moving. There was a picture of a wee girl who was missing. It was drawn by children at the nursery and it said: ‘We miss you. Come back soon.’
“I just wanted to help in some way. Even just talking to somebody and making somebody smile because I had a Scottish accent. I felt very proud to be there and to be part of the British Red Cross response.”
Marilisa Casturà, from Norwich, Norfolk
Marilisa Casturà dedicated her weekends and evenings to providing a calm and supportive ear to hundreds of people affected by last summer’s incidents by volunteering on the British Red Cross emergency support helpline, alongside working a full-time job.
Despite living in the east of England – far away from the events – by the time the Grenfell tragedy unfolded she was already providing emotional and practical support to people had been caught up in both the terror attacks at the Manchester Arena and London Bridge. Two weeks later she travelled to London to support the families there.
Marilisa said: “The sense of community that I felt at Grenfell was like nothing that I’d ever experienced anywhere else. You see these incidents on the news but you don’t feel that togetherness and strength until you’re there.”
“At the rest centre I remember sitting down with someone, making them a cup of tea and just listening to them – even though it was a small gesture they were so grateful. You just help in whatever way you can.”
Pearl Mullan, from Ballykelly in Northern Ireland
Despite never having flown before, Pearl felt compelled to get on a plane to London last summer to help support people affected by the Grenfell Tower fire. She has been supporting the British Red Cross for 12 years and was inspired to sign up as an emergency response, and first aid volunteer, to help support people in crisis after an emergency.
“I was very nervous getting on the plane for the first time,” said Pearl. “We managed it OK in the end. I just thought this is something I am going to have to do if I want to go there and help people. I just wanted to see if we could help in any way.”

Hope and Strength: resilience in disaster zones – in photos ","Leading photographers have joined forces with disaster relief charity ShelterBox to produce Hope and Strength. They say the photo series is a tribute to the incredible strength of families living through devastation in disaster zones across the world
Photographers Olly Burn, Tom Stoddart, Veronique de Viguerie and Dougie Wallace travelled around the world to take photos of people who are living in disaster zones.
“In circumstances often defined by violence and tragedy, these families show courage, determination and resilience,” say the photographers. “The photographs capture the incredible power that people possess to carry on and be hopeful.”

Eating with strangers: bringing people together through food ","A grassroots movement is bringing people together via a shared love of food, from refugees to socially isolated older people. Sonia Zhuravlyova meets those who are breaking bread, and building bonds
Nothing binds us together like food. Even the word ‘companion’ comes from Latin and means ‘with bread’ – someone friendly with whom to share a meal. We live in an age of seemingly countless restaurants and when an explosion of food delivery companies means more and more of us are opting for solo suppers, often enjoyed in front of screens. Our near-24/7 schedules and the rise of technology threaten to push companionable eating clear off the menu.
But, as they say, necessity is the mother of invention. A new wave of clubs, projects and charities are using the unique power food has to bring people together, from newly arrived refugees to older or bereaved people, and from people looking for love, to global travellers.
Chef and political activist Kerstin Rodgers is credited with launching the supper club movement in Britain and says the idea was born after a trip to Cuba, where creating restaurants in people’s living rooms is common. Without enough money to open a “real” restaurant, she went for the DIY version. Rodgers’ Underground Restaurant, launched in her home in Kilburn, north London, in 2009, was a hit and has spawned countless variations on the theme, from Jewish suppers and African feasts to New Year’s Eve fondue nights.
“It’s really hard to make connections in a big city, especially if you’re single,” she says. “At a supper club, you’re obliged to make conversation. It’s about putting away your phone and making a social effort, relating to people face to face.”

Because there’s a difference between sharing food and sharing a meal. Anyone can order their own dish in a restaurant but at a supper club, people eat the same thing, often helping themselves to a portion and then passing it along, which encourages sociability, empathy and trust. “Eating together is a way of bonding. I do a lot of family-style dishing: you’re passing things to each other so you have to learn to share,” says Rodgers. And watching people go from zero to potential friends – or even lovers – across her dining-room table is magical. “Creating all these connections feels to me like a kind of witchcraft.”
While some supper clubs – and apps such as the now-defunct AirDine, which allowed users to attend dinner parties at strangers’ homes around the world – may cater in particular for young professionals feeling alienated by big-city living, the act of sharing food goes far deeper. “It can be very powerful,” says Julia Turshen, chef and author of recipe book Feed the Resistance. “If you have a bunch of people sitting around a table in a conference room it can feel tense and unnatural – but if you put food on that table and it becomes a meal, it goes from being a meeting to a more relaxed set-up.”
At a supper club, you’re obliged to make conversation. It’s about putting away your phone and making a social effort, relating to people face to face
What’s more, food can change perceptions. “Consider whether the recipe you’re cooking was written by someone who’s had a different life experience to you. Read about what that food means to them and understand their story,” recommends Turshen, who mentions the case of Derek Black in the US. Black’s father was a grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan. An invitation from a college classmate to a Shabbat dinner led him to reconsider the views he had adopted without question.
Turshen’s book – which features recipes alongside resources and essays from activists – has a political edge but its message is universal and pleasingly simple: dishes can foster community while providing sustenance for the mind and soul. So find a way to feed your community, she urges. The first step? Invite someone for dinner who’s different from you; talking about the food you’re sharing can build bridges. “You can’t talk about food without talking about everything that matters,” notes Turshen. “The environment, migrants’ rights, gender, race and sexuality. All these things come up when we talk about food.”
Finding a place at the table
Even the smallest of efforts can make a big difference. Consider the Casserole Club, which allows an extra portion of your home-cooked supper to be dropped off to an older neighbour who could benefit from a warm, nutritious meal and a friendly chat. What if we were all able to shop at places like the e5 Roasthouse in Poplar, London, where the employees are refugee women who have been trained up by the nearby e5 Bakehouse in the art of baking bread?
It’s a model that works well: training in the hospitality sector, combined with English lessons, because it helps in a practical sense but also offers refugees agency and allows them to give back to the community, mitigating feelings of helplessness. Migrateful does just that. Founded by Jess Thompson, the project involves asylum seekers, refugees and migrants teaching their traditional cuisines to paying customers.

“Having regular contact with the British public is great for confidence building,” says Thompson. “Feeling valued as a teacher can be so important. Many of the people who come to Migrateful are asylum seekers; they are often waiting for the state to help them. This is a chance for them to use their skills and give something back.”
Elahe Reza, 48, came to Britain from Iran a decade ago. Although she is a psychologist by training, her English isn’t good enough to allow her to qualify here. Cooking sessions at Migrateful give her a real boost, she explains, because she was previously too shy to speak to strangers. It’s also a form of expression. “Now I feel a lot more confident, even though I still make mistakes,” says Reza. “I don’t have the words to tell you everything that is in my heart – about the cooking, the new friends, my new skills – everything.”
To support its participants, Migrateful also offers travel card credit and supermarket vouchers, as well as helping refugees get their qualifications converted to acceptable equivalents.
The environment, migrants’ rights, gender, race and sexuality. All these things come up when we talk about food
Stories On Our Plate (SOOP) was founded in 2016 to use food and storytelling to overcome differences, challenging negative attitudes towards cooks with refugee and migrant backgrounds. Central to SOOP’s work are monthly ‘food stories’ supper clubs.
One recent event featured the food of Jenny Phung, who drew upon her Cantonese and Vietnamese heritage to cook up seasonal dishes based on humble street cafes of China. Another featured the flavours and stories of Palestine, with chef Nisrin Abuorf. Dishes included hurra’ usba’o, a sweet and savoury dish of lentils cooked in pomegranate molasses, with garlic and mini dumplings, garnished with coriander and crispy pitta. And then came pistachio namourah, a sweet and sticky semolina cake draped with orange blossom syrup and covered with chopped pistachios.

A similar enterprise is Mazi Mas (meaning ‘with us’ in Greek), an award-winning social enterprise that provides training and employment to help refugee women build careers in the food industry. Running pop-up restaurants and kitchen residencies, the women of Mazi Mas put their existing culinary skills to use in professional settings, leading to the practical experience necessary to start their own food businesses or be employed in others.

It’s not just refugees who benefit from this type of exchange. While working in a homeless hostel in north London, Meg Doherty realised that communal cooking brought a type of energy and enthusiasm far beyond anything she’d previously seen there.
“I started thinking about the stories we tell with food – and how we could challenge the stigma of homelessness through this. I think people do want to help with homelessness, especially during winter, but often don’t know how to do it.”
This is where Doherty’s catering company and pop-up supper club, Fat Macy’s, has been making a real difference. Launched in 2016, it aims to teach people multiple sides of catering and earn enough to move out of the hostels. “We wanted it to be about people having ownership of the food and the cooking, taking positive steps to get out of the hostels, rather than it being something that happens to them,” she explains.

An unforeseen benefit is the kind of conversation that take place at Fat Macy’s events. Guests meet the people cooking and serving the food and the setting allows for a warmer personal interaction, one that leads frequently to genuine offers of help, from work experience to jobs.
The social benefit of cooking for – and eating with – people is felt firmly at Cook to Give, based in Dudley, Northumberland. Run by charity Forward Assist which supports military veterans in adjusting to civilian life, its mission is to teach unemployed veterans to cook – and get qualifications along the way. Those who take part prepare weekly meals for older veterans: their youngest chef is 22 and one of the regular veterans is 100. In a community afflicted by PTSD and in which many miss the camaraderie of life in the forces, interacting in this way across the generations is a chance to share their experiences and anecdotes and grow confidence. Last year, volunteers prepared more than 3,000 free meals – from herby spaghetti bolognese to pineapple upside down cake.
At a time when difference threatens to pull communities apart, cooking and eating are among the things we’re guaranteed to hold in common. So, could it have a unique power to bridge divides and feed our spirits? The proof, you could say, is in the pudding.

A place at the table: two inspiring UK food projects ","From dumplings with a distinctly global flavour, to plant-based dishes that are ‘definitely not boring’, we zoom in on two UK projects that connect people using food
Heart & Parcel
Manchester-based Heart & Parcel connects women from migrant communities through making dumplings, helping improve their English at the same time. It was set up by friends Karolina Koscien and Clare Courtney: Koscien grew up in Poland with a pierogi-making expert mother, while Courtney spent her childhood in Hong Kong surrounded by dim sum. “Dumplings appear in almost every culture but differ in shape and filling,” says Koscien.
“The process of making them requires teamwork, a long period of time and many conversations in between. The fillings inside dumplings represent the hidden resources and skills of women from migrant communities living here in Britain today.”

Up Beet
“We love to cook. We love to eat delicious food too. And we don’t think eating plant-based food should be boring,” say the team at Up Beet, a vegan food business based in Brighton. They run pop-up supper clubs, give cooking lessons and cater at events including weddings and birthdays as well as teaming up with charities like Help Refugees, and FareShare Sussex.
Their Voyage of Discovery nights take guests on dining adventures with each menu centred on food from a particular part of the world, from warming south-east Asian curries to rustic Tuscan dishes. And Up Beet’s Spinning Plates events match good music with great vegan food: guests are invited to submit song requests to accompany the meal.

Bricking it: turning human waste into clean fuel ","A social enterprise is transforming human waste into a clean, affordable fuel in Kenya. It smells like the future, discovers Oliver Balch
Andrew Foote likes to talk crap. He’d talk crap all day if you let him. Especially other people’s crap. Because for this 29-year-old US environment engineer, crap (or “poop” as he prefers), is the future. He knows that discussing human waste and how it’s managed is “not super glamorous”.
Yet, equally, he knows if he doesn’t talk about it, then few others will. Even in international development circles, it remains taboo.
Yet the poop problem is at crisis levels in many poor countries. In Kenya, for instance, where Foote co-founded his firm Sanivation in 2014, an average of 17,000 under-fives die of diarrhoea every year. Foote is convinced these deaths could be avoided if the children had access to a clean, safe toilet.
So that’s what Sanivation does: it provides toilets to some of the poorest householders in Naivasha, a large market town north-west of Nairobi. The cost? Just $2 (£1.50) per month.
Cooking using the briquettes, clean-burning alternatives to charcoal
But it’s what then happens to all this “faecal fudge” (another of Foote’s euphemisms) that’s most remarkable.
Sanivation collects the human waste of its participating householders and processes it using a solar thermal technology of its own design. It is then converted into charcoal-like briquettes, which are sold in the local community for cooking and domestic heating.
The briquettes provide a lower-carbon and longer-lasting alternative to charcoal, producing just a third of the carbon emissions of conventional briquettes.
Foote is keen to grow his venture. Together with the Norwegian Refugee Council, Sanivation has set up a similar scheme in Kakuma refugee camp near the border with South Sudan. It provides sanitation services to 2,500 people in total and has sold 70,000 tonnes of briquettes (saving more than 6,000 trees).
The more sanitation entrepreneurs we can support and inspire, the better it will be for everyone
Sanivation plans to establish 30 more factories making poop-based briquettes across Kenya within the next three years, expanding to 100 across Africa by 2022. Each factory costs around $1m (£765,000), which Foote reckons can be recouped within six to seven years.
“In Kenya, the charcoal market is worth $1.4bn (£1.1bn), so quite a big market for us to tap into,” he says.
As well as briquettes for domestic use, Sanivation also makes carbonised pellets for industry-scale boilers. To help fund the firm’s growth, Foote hopes to strike supply deals with large companies, most of which currently use woodchips as feedstock for their biomass boilers.
Sanivation aims to improve sanitation services in poor areas, as well as producing a clean energy source for cooking and heating
Sanivation’s solar thermal technology is awaiting patent. However, Foote hopes that other innovators will jump into the field too. Indeed, he’d actively welcome it if others moved in to the poop market and started developing alternative technological solutions.
“We need more people talking about today’s sanitation crisis,” he says. “The more sanitation entrepreneurs we can support and inspire, the better it will be for everyone.”

New organic sanitary subscription service pledges to help tackle period poverty around the world ","Launched this week, Freda offers organic sanitary towels and tampons via subscription. The company pledges to donate a proportion of profits to schemes that are tackling period poverty in the UK and beyond
Freda is a monthly subscription service offering tampons made from organic cotton, and pads that are made from wood pulp. The London-based company, which launched on Wednesday, claims both are free from chemicals. It will donate 15 per cent of profits to projects in the UK and globally that help girls and women who can’t afford to buy sanitary products.
These include A Bloody Good Cause, a UK initiative to provide pads to refugees and homeless women, Bloody Good Period, which aims to give asylum seekers better access to period care, and Killi Pads, a micro enterprise in Tanzania which produces reusable cloth pads with locally sourced materials for schoolgirls, many of whom live in poverty and lack access to running water, hygienic facilities or basic period care.
Affi Parvizi-Wayne (pictured above) launched Freda after seeing refugees stuck at European border crossings and wondering how they managed their periods. “From transparency to responsibility to access, the whole femcare space needs rebooting,” she told Positive News.
Freda’s tampons are made from organic cotton and are biodegradable, hypoallergenic and free from chemicals and synthetic fibres
“We want to talk openly about the subject without patronising women or telling them how to live their periods. We want to embrace how we experience periods and start recognising them as a sign of a healthy woman.”
Freda also uses artificial intelligence to predict women’s start dates: its online period tracker allows customers to sync the delivery of products to ensure they arrive at the right time of the month.
We want to talk openly about the subject without patronising women or telling them how to live their periods
“I was struck by the lack of available information around what actually goes into pads and tampons,” said Parvizi-Wayne. “Just as we pay attention to what goes into the foods that we eat and the products we put on our skin, we should also be able to make a more informed decision when it comes to the most intimate product we as women use. Do women realise that some high street pads and tampons are actually made of chemicals, fragrances, dyes, rayon, polyester, polyethylene, polyproprylene, chlorine and pesticides which are linked to health conditions? And would they continue buying these brands on auto-pilot if they did?”
The pads are made from wood pulp and contain no dyes, fragrances and deodorants, say Freda
She said access to period care is a “basic human and universal right, not a luxury”.
“The lives and education of hundreds of millions of girls worldwide are impeded by not having access to period essentials – and in 2018 that’s simply not OK.”

Peace by peace: how damaged communities work through trauma ","War clouds over Korea, terror on the streets… It can feel as though a peaceful world is a receding dream. But a small group of activists scattered across the globe is turning dreams into reality, peace by peace
Picture this. Africa, somewhere. A man and a woman, sitting together, in green shade. Husband and wife, or perhaps mother and son – her face soft with care as her hand rests on his arm. It’s a peaceful image, in a world fast becoming less so.
There was a time, after the end of the Cold War and its proxy battles, when it seemed as though violence had gone out of fashion. As peacebuilding experts International Alert note, the number of wars under way had dropped from 50 in 1990, to just 30 in 2010. Decades-long conflicts in Colombia, Myanmar, the Philippines and elsewhere were sealed in peace accords. Just a few years on, and the picture is bloodied again, with new wars bringing the total back up to 40, and new, alarming types of terrorism surging fear into the heart of the world’s great cities once more.
Reconciliation efforts have been central to Rwanda’s response to the 1994 genocide. Image: Hanna Morris
But there’s another story out there. It rarely makes the news, but it holds out quiet hope behind the headlines. It’s a story of peacebuilding; of finding ways to bring people together, to defuse anger before it explodes, to build resilience into shattered communities.
Mapping out hope in the slums
The Arab Spring burst into life in Tunis in 2011, fuelled by years of frustration among a generation of young, often underemployed men. Several years on, many of the hopes they felt then have withered, as old corrupt patterns re-emerge. Some turn to gangs and crime, some to Islamist extremism, including Islamic State, which found a ready source of recruits among them.
But in two of the most deprived districts of the capital, Ettadhamen and Douar Hicher – often described as hotbeds of radicalism – others are busy using a version of the OpenStreetMap app to map out their neighbourhoods. No one has ever done so before, as the areas were seen as simply slums. Now, in a partnership with International Alert, young men and women are using their newly created maps to pinpoint places in need of basic services: rubbish collection, a health post, or road improvements to tackle an accident blackspot. And they are helping shape how local budgets are allocated, with the Ettadhamen municipality allocating half its spending to be decided by citizen forums, with a third of their members under the age of 35.
As Hassen, one of the participants, says: “At first the authorities didn’t believe in us. They thought we were just taking pictures with our phones. But now they have seen our achievements, they respect us.”
Planting peace in Syria
A garden might seem the gentlest of responses to Syria’s vicious, intractable war. But giving children the chance to grow their own fruit and vegetables in school plots not only ensures they eat better in a country where agricultural supply chains have been badly disrupted. It also instils a sense of nurturing; of sowing seeds – literally – for the future. A joint EU–UN project has seen gardens created in 17 schools, including in conflict zones such as Aleppo, Hama, Homs and Idlib. Teachers are trained to deliver gardening skills, and water tanks and drip irrigation help ensure a good harvest. More than 12 tonnes of fruit and vegetables have been produced to date.

The children are taking their learning back home. As the mother of one girl, Bilasan from rural Damascus, says: “She’s planted strawberries, and every morning she gets the hose and waters the plants and tells me ‘this is what I learned at school, mum!’”
The scheme is now being extended to another 35 schools, thanks to support from the Japanese government.
In Lebanon, meanwhile, International Alert is running peace education classes to help traumatised Syrian refugee children such as 12-year-old Aboud, whose elder brother was a fighter, and who wanted to follow in his footsteps to become a brigade commander, even after he was killed.
His teacher, Aida, says: “The children [have been] surrounded only by violence, so no wonder that is how they respond. How they express it is different, but they all feel rage. We are showing them that there is another way to be, to behave. At first the parents were not sure. Now they are asking for classes to happen twice a week, for adult classes, and for longer classes.”
Hatem, Aboud’s father, is among them. Sceptical at first, he noticed a change in his son as the teachers gradually gave him ways to express anger and show leadership without bullying his classmates. “I never expected it to work [but I’ve seen] his behaviour change even at home. Instead of breaking plates after a meal, he now washes them.”
The children [have been] surrounded only by violence, so no wonder that is how they respond. We are showing them that there is another way to be, to behave
Rwanda: land of a thousand healings
Rwanda’s extraordinary recovery after the trauma of the 1994 genocide owes much to its adoption of reconciliation, rather than retribution, as a response. With hundreds of thousands of perpetrators and victims on either side, it had little choice. A system of local courts imposed sentences, many of which included elements of community work. But healing takes time – time to talk, and to listen. Local NGOs collaborated with International Alert to set up ‘dialogue clubs’, bringing attackers and those they hurt – many of whom still live in the same villages – together.

People like Aloys and Patricia, pictured above. Neither husband and wife, nor mother and son, but rather, a one-time killer and his prey. During the genocide, Aloys was part of a group who attacked Patricia with machetes, leaving her for dead, after most of her family had been killed. Two decades on, they live as neighbours. Dialogue clubs have helped them come to terms with their past.
After serving eight years in jail, Aloys faced many more years of shame and isolation, not to mention fear of revenge, but thanks to the clubs, he says, he was able to approach Patricia and other victims and ask their forgiveness. “This has given me the dignity I lost when I was in jail.”
Patricia, too, has been able to find some solace. She says: “There is no future for peace unless we can live in peace with our neighbours, even if they were among those who attacked me.”
SMALL MIRACLES
Grassroots initiatives like these may seem a fragile gesture in the face of the horror of war. But by healing wounds, and turning potential killers away from violence, they’re achieving small miracles – for the merest fraction of what is spent on fighting. Globally, the total budget for peacebuilding of all kinds in 2016 was $10bn – and that includes some major peacekeeping operations. By comparison, military expenditure in that year was $1.7tn (£1.3tn)– close to 200 times as much. And the cost of conflict to the world’s economy in the same period? $14.3tn (£10.8tn). If ever there were a case for investment, this is surely it."

Unlocking the code: teaching girls in Afghanistan coding ","Fereshteh Forough is founder of Code to Inspire, the first all-female coding school in Afghanistan. Ambition has taken her from refugee to CEO
Fereshteh Forough was born as an Afghan refugee in Iran, one of eight children. A year after the fall of the Taliban, she moved to Afghanistan where she studied computer science, and later Berlin where she earned a master’s degree. Then she founded Code to Inspire, the first all-female coding school in Afghanistan. By teaching girls in-demand programming skills, she hopes to help them be independent.
— How did your experience as a refugee shape you?
In Iran, I got the impression that people think refugees have come to take your job and to steal opportunities out from under you. On the other hand, I learned that great things can start with empty hands. You learn to get the most out of the least, the value of adaptation and to appreciate even small opportunities.
— How hard was it for you to access education in Iran?
Being treated as an unwanted guest is not a pleasant experience. I don’t remember how many times the schools rejected my siblings and I, but I do remember how many times my father knocked on each office’s door to get the documents allowing us to attend school. My father was always very supportive of us pursuing education and helped us with our homework. My mother learned to make dresses which she sold to buy us school supplies.
A childhood photo of Fereshteh and her family
— What was it like returning to Afghanistan?
We moved to Herat in 2002, packing everything in a big truck. I was very unhappy to move from a place where I had so many friends and memories to one I only knew through my mother’s photo al-bum and as a war zone on TV.
I remember it was a very windy day with dust in the air, and that there weren’t many trees. It took us hours to get to the city. By the time we were close, it was getting dark. Old lanterns hung outside the shops. At the new house, we got our water from a well. We only had electricity for three hours each day.
— Did you experience a culture shock travelling to Berlin, and beyond since?
I love Berlin. It is a very diverse city. I like to travel and learn about people and new cultures. People from certain countries or religions face discrimination – extra check-in time at airports for example – but I’m used to it now. I won’t let my gender and ethnic background set me back.
— Why did you set up Code to Inspire?
Most of the time in Afghanistan, even if a female student graduated from a computer science course, she wouldn’t have been able to find a job in the field. If women are offered jobs outside of their hometown, the majority of families wouldn’t let them leave. Young women can’t travel by ground even with a male companion. Decades of war, internal conflicts and political instability in Afghanistan have destroyed the country’s basic social service mechanisms.
We opened the first coding school for girls in Afghanistan in 2015. We run free, after-school programmes: safe places where girls can enjoy learning.
You learn to get the most out of the least, the value of adaptation and to appreciate even small opportunities
— What challenges and obstacles have you had to overcome in doing so?
It has been no easy feat! Preparing the right documents to operate as a non-profit organisation and to raise the necessary funds for the coding school were huge tasks.
But I am persistent and energised. It gives me hope to know that 50 girls in Afghanistan are learning and growing every day because of Code to Inspire.
Fereshteh Forough, image: Alena Soboleva
— What do you love about technology?
Coding is a language like any other, and a great tool for communicating. I love the creativity and problem-solving aspect. Knowledge is power. Technology – its power and connectivity – has helped make my dream come true.
— What are you most proud of in your life?
Students who have never before touched a computer or used the internet are now able to make webpages and code because of us. Every day when I wake up, I check Twitter to see inspiring messages from students about what they’ve achieved. Our students are bold, courageous and inspiring. They are agents of change, in a country where women have been deprived for decades.
Destruction is easy, construction is difficult, so we have a lot of work left to do
— What makes you feel positive about the future?
During the Taliban regime, fewer than a million students were enrolled in schools, and no women. Today, nearly seven million children are enrolled in schools: around 37 per cent of them girls. There are hundreds of public and private universities. A study by Kabul University found that 40 per cent of STEM [science, technology, engineering and mathematics] students are women.
As of 2014, 90 per cent of residential areas in Afghanistan have telecommunication and information coverage. There are now 23.2 million mobile phone users in the country. In total, 28 per cent of the seats in parliament are held by women.
These numbers show that progress is being made in Afghanistan. Destruction is easy, construction is difficult, so we have a lot of work left to do, but I am hopeful of a peaceful, bright future for Afghanistan.

Forget rampant consumerism: 10 alternatives to Black Friday ","As UK shoppers are forecast to spend £10bn in Black Friday sales this week, we’re encouraging people to ‘give stories, not stuff’ with a Positive News gift subscription. Here are 10 other inspiring alternatives to the Black Friday frenzy
1) Revamp your wardrobe without going shopping
Bright Friday
The #BrightFriday campaign aims to raise awareness of textiles waste and encourages people to get value from clothes they already have by swapping, restyling and refashioning instead of buying new this Black Friday. In the UK, a third of the clothes in a typical wardrobe haven’t been worn in the past year, and 300,000 tonnes of clothing ends up in the bin each year, according to WRAP. #BrightFriday has been organised by sustainability charity Hubbub.
Get involved: Join #BrightFriday and hold a clothes swap with friends, or join one of Hubbub’s swaps in London
2) Quell the mania by reading a book in peace
Saturday Sanctuary
A campaign to celebrate bookshops and the joy of reading is suggesting you make Saturday #SaturdaySanctuary. The advice from the Books Are My Bag team reads: “Mark Saturday 25 November as ‘busy’ in your diaries, write a Christmas shopping list (with some room for recommendations), plan which bookshops you’ll be visiting, invite all your friends, treat yourself to some #Bibliotherapy.”
Get involved: Visit booksaremybag.com and use the hashtags #SaturdaySanctuary and #Bibliotherapy
3) Get outdoors and enjoy nature
Opt Outside
“BYO adrenaline” says US-based outdoor clothing retailer – and co-operative – REI. For the third year in a row, the company is closing all of its shops on Black Friday and is instead urging people to #OptOutside and spend time in nature with friends and family. It will pay its 12,000 employees but shut all 151 shops and process no online sales either. “We are doing this again to unite people and to find common ground in the outdoors,” said REI CEO Jerry Stritzke. “Right now, I think people are looking for a moment to take a breath, reground themselves and come together.”
Get involved: Share your #OptOutside experiences here
4) Support ethical businesses instead
Shop Ethical Instead
Black Friday encourages us to shop for things that we don’t really need or want, points out Sian Conway, the driving force behind Ethical Hour – an online community for ethical and sustainable businesses. “This Black Friday we’re bringing together ethical brands from around the world for our #ShopEthicalInstead campaign – encouraging people to spend their money with small businesses and social enterprises and make a positive impact instead,” said Conway. According to Social Enterprise UK, there are nearly 80,000 social enterprises in the UK, employing more than a million people and contributing more than £24bn to the economy.

5) Buy secondhand – and make a difference at the same time
Buy Nothing New Day

Dispelling the myth that secondhand means second best, the Furniture Re-use Network will hold Buy Nothing New Day on Friday (24 November). The team is urging people to support their local furniture reuse charity by donating to or buying from them. Craig Anderson, CEO of the Furniture Re-use Network, which has 200 members, says: “Our members don’t just rely on furniture donations to provide essential household goods to those in need, alongside providing employment and volunteering opportunities. They also rely on customers to buy from their shops to support their core activities to help people in time of crisis.” In 2016, 3.45m items of furniture and electrical equipment are thought to have been reused in the UK.
Get involved: Find your nearest furniture re-use charity here, and share your charity treasures on social media using #BuyNothingNew
6) Buy gifts for refugees in need
The pop-up shop where you can buy presents for refugees
Choose Love is a pop-up shop in Soho, London, where you can buy real products for refugees, from emergency blankets to school bags and medical equipment. “Shop to your heart’s content, leave with nothing, and feel great,” say the team behind it. All funds raised will go to UK charity Help Refugees which works across Europe and the Middle East. It was founded in 2015 as part of a grassroots movement of volunteers. The charity’s CEO Josie Naughton said: “It’s easy to forget how lucky we are to have a bed, a blanket and a roof over our heads. For thousands of refugees this winter, these basic human needs are completely out of reach. This shop is all about one simple idea: that we should all choose love this Christmas and help those in need.” Every item on sale in the shop, from mobile phone credit to warm socks, is accompanied by a story about how and why it was chosen. Prices range from £4.99 to £499.
Get involved: Find out more here and visit the shop at 18 Broadwick Street, London, W1F 8HS, from Friday (24 November) until 31 January 2018
7) Put your wallet away and give your time
Volunteer instead
Instead of rushing to the shops, consider spending the day, or part of it, volunteering. It can prove beneficial in unexpected ways as well as helping those in need: volunteering can help lower your blood pressure, according a study published in the US journal Psychology and Aging.
Get involved: Visit the National Council for Voluntary Organisations’ volunteering information page here, or see Volunteer Match for places to volunteer near you
8) Support independent designers and artists
Just A Card
Image: Sarah Hamilton
The Just A Card campaign aims to encourage people to buy from designers and makers, and independent galleries and shops. The message? That all purchases, however small – even ‘just a card’ – are vital to the survival of small businesses. The campaign came about when artist and designer Sarah Hamilton saw the quote “If everyone who’d complimented our beautiful gallery had bought ‘just a card’ we’d still be open” by storekeepers who had recently closed their gallery.
“People seldom realise the considerable costs involved in exhibiting at design shows or keeping a shop open,” said Hamilton. “Stand fees, power, materials and wages need to be met before even a penny of profit can be realised. Running a shop is often a labour of love. Without dedication and passion, and crucially sales, it would be another boarded-up eyesore.”
Get involved: Visit the Just A Card website here and share your thoughts on social media using #JustACard
9) Go cold turkey on consumption
Buy Nothing Day
Image: adbusters.org
Adbusters, a global network of activists, artists, writers, designers and “poets, philosophers and punks”, is behind Buy Nothing Day. They say: “As the Christmas season approaches, keep in mind that buying stuff will never make you happy. It might lift your spirits for a few hours, or if you’re lucky, maybe a day or two, but in the end (and we mean the real end) your connections, your friends, your family, and your human experiences are all you’ve really got. So this year, at this moment in history when the existential threat of climate change is breathing down our necks, why not do something wildly different: Ignore Black Friday.”

10) Support companies that are doing their bit
Brands giving profits to charity
Some brands trading on Friday are choosing to give profits to charity. From midnight on 24 November until midnight on 25 November, 100 per cent of sales from Pukka’s website will go to Pukka’s two chosen charities: the Forest of Avon Trust and The Matthew Tree Project, both of which are based in the company’s hometown of Bristol. Patagonia and Fat Face are among the high street names to take a similar tack in the past.

A world of colour: five destinations to dazzle the eye ","From Morocco to Miami, intriguing stories lie behind some of the most colourful cities in the world. We go where grey is not an option
1) Living on the bright side
No two neighbouring houses on the Venetian island of Burano are the same colour. Local legend has it that people began painting their homes as brightly as possible so that fishermen could see them even in thick fog and avoid crashing.
2) Blue is the colour
Image: Badder Manaouch
Chefchaouen in Morocco has been given a blue rinse: homes, mosques, government buildings and even its rubbish bins and lampposts. No one is certain why, but one theory is that Jewish refugees who settled there brought with them a tradition of painting things blue to mirror the sky, reminding them of God.
3) Painting the town
Image: Flickr user Marissa Strniste
The port neighbourhood of La Boca in Buenos Aires, Argentina, faces many challenges: poverty and crime among them. But it’s a mecca for football fans – being home to the Boca Juniors team – and features the Caminito street museum of brightly coloured houses. Fishermen once used bright, leftover marine paints, say local guides.
4) Street smarts
Home to some of the best street art in South America, Valparaíso in Chile is a labyrinth of colourful alleys and avenues. Brightly painted 19th century churches stand next to even more brilliant modern murals. Rather than shunning the street art, city authorities seem to be embracing it as a cultural asset.
5) Miami spice
Known for its art deco heritage, Miami is a visual feast of neon lights, quirky patterns, and palm trees. Known as The Magic City, the palette here is mint green, soft lemon yellow, cyan crashing waves, and hot white sand.

Three good things: harnessing human energy for good ","From motion-powered mobile phone chargers to urine-powered electricity; three ways in which human energy is pushing society forward
1. All hands on spec
Image: HandEnergy
A 19-year-old inventor from Minsk, Belarus, has developed a mobile phone charger that is powered by the human body. Users rotate their hands to power up their HandEnergy devices – the brainchild of Michael Vaga. Each contains a gyroscope which collects the energy from movement and allows it to be stored. It takes around an hour to fully charge a phone battery this way.
2. The electricity generation
Image: Pavegen
The world’s first ‘smart street’ has appeared in London. A pavement that turns footsteps into electricity was launched in June by Pavegen, a company specialising in harvesting energy from footfall. Lighting on Bird Street, a traffic-free street near shoppers’ paradise Oxford Street, is now powered by pedestrians. Visitors can track the energy they generate via sensors and an app as they pound the pavement.
3. Urine luck

Scientists at the Bristol Bioenergy Centre have come up with a clever use for human urine. Their 40-person Pee Power urinal includes microbial fuel cells which contain bacteria. The cells are activated when the live bacteria consume urine, producing electricity. It was piloted at Glastonbury festival, powering up information boards. The team hopes the technology can be used in refugee camps that lack sanitation and electricity.

People take the place of books in the global Human Library ","Think you can read people? You can at the Human Library, an international project that aims to dissolve prejudices by getting people to talk to others they wouldn’t ordinarily meet
This summer, a group of keen readers met at a library in Mogadishu, Somalia. They were there to have a browse and further their knowledge. But they were reading people, not books.
Beginning in Denmark in 2000, the Human Library now has projects in more than 80 countries. The concept is simple: readers can borrow a real person for 30 minutes, listen to their story, and ask questions. Thousands of people across the world have now ‘read’ stories from the library. ‘Books’ include Brain Damaged, Alcoholic, Polyamorous, Young Single Mother and Naturist.
“There are so many issues we are not dealing with as a society,” says founder Ronni Abergel. “Refugees, mental health, homelessness, sexuality, alcoholism, the list goes on. How often do you get to have an honest conversation with someone who is affected by such things?”
It was eye-opening for me as a ‘book’, as much as it was for my readers to learn my story
Noura Søborg is another title in the library. A refugee and feminist, she fled Syria in 2011 and settled in Copenhagen. “Taking part in the Human Library allowed me not only to share my own story, but it gave me insight into the new society I was living in, the people I was newly surrounded by.
Muffe Vulnuz, also known as the Extreme Body Modified book, also features in the Human Library
“It was eye-opening for me as a ‘book’, as much as it was for my readers to learn my story.”
Fellow title Katy Jon Went (Asexual Non-Binary Bipolar) agrees that the experience is a two-way street. “It is unusual because the book can answer back. I find very illuminating the questions your reader wants to ask. The Human Library helps me be seen as an individual, and promotes understanding about my life.”
Library sessions have now taken place in Australia, Iceland, Finland, Romania, Slovenia, Belgium and the Netherlands, among other countries. The Human Library partners with universities, businesses and NGOs including Amnesty and Crisis. The Human Library is currently running a series of events in the UK entitled Open Your World, featuring some of the library’s ‘bestsellers’.
“Libraries are the last neutral spaces in society, places where there is no agenda, where people can be free to ask what they want. It’s amazing the conversations that can flow from that,” says Abergel.
“All we ask is that they return our books in the same condition they found them.”

https://www.positive.news/society/different-belongs-magazine-seeking-redefine-means-foreigner/,refugee,958,"October 30, 2017",Franki Cookney,"
Different belongs: the magazine seeking to redefine what it means to be a ‘foreigner’ ","Historically, the word ‘foreigner’ has had negative connotations: alien, outsider. Is that about to change? Franki Cookney meets the co-founder of a UK-based online magazine showcasing stories that highlight how diversity and tolerance can be a force for good
“You wouldn’t want to be a foreigner, right?” Francesca Oddenino laughs, but she’s making a serious point. Too often, she says, foreigners are portrayed as desperate survivors bent on invading society to meet their own needs.
As the co-founder of online magazine, Foreigner, Oddenino wants to unpick the notion that some might have of migrants being a faceless group of intruders. Instead, she aims to present them as unique individuals.
“The way social media portrays foreigners is superficial. It’s often as someone who’s detached from society, with no depth,” she says. “We felt compelled to show that there is so much more to being a foreigner than that.”
The project aims to ‘rebrand’ the term by showcasing people’s stories and photos, including those of fashion designer Anne-Sophie Cochevelou, who is originally from France, and India-born entrepreneur Malav Sanghavi.
The idea was conceived by Oddenino and three of her friends after a dinnertime discussion about how Britain talks and thinks about foreigners. They are a team of four, all born outside the UK themselves, from Italy, Germany and France, with backgrounds in design, finance and journalism. Alongside the magazine, they intend to get involved in awareness campaigns and events promoting diversity and tolerance. But, notes Oddenino, they remain non-political.
“The initial trigger was the post-Brexit animosity and backlash. As foreigners ourselves, we felt unwanted and that was a feeling many of our friends shared,” she says. “We recognise that foreigners are part of the political agenda, but we don’t want to protest; we want to take a more positive approach.”

One of the issues, she says, is that many people see foreigners as ‘too different’. The team will challenge this by showing that rather than being disruptive or destabilising, difference can actually be a force for good.
“Diversity can bring different ideas to the table, different points of view. It helps us tackle issues in ways that maybe we wouldn’t have thought of before.”
Moreover, she says, far from being greedy and disinterested, many foreigners move because they want to learn, contribute and experience a new culture. “You’re trying to push your boundaries, get out of your comfort zone, challenge yourself. Becoming a foreigner is about fulfilling a need that’s stronger than simply being comfortable.”
Diversity can bring different ideas to the table, different points of view
The team also acknowledge that people relocate to the UK for a wide variety of reasons: from those who have made decisions based on education or lifestyle, to people who arrive as desperate, often traumatised, refugees for whom there is very little choice involved.
Oddenino’s own experience of living in a new country has made her more empathetic. “If we had a long-term goal, it would be for everyone to try to give it a go. It’s healthy to get outside your comfort zone, it enriches you as a person. Instead of ‘foreigner’ being something you don’t want to be, we see it as aspirational.”

“I was born and raised in India and came to London in 2014 to study innovation design engineering. After finishing my master’s, my goal was to have a startup, and London is a major hub of innovation, providing entrepreneurs with connections, exposure and resources.
The UK has provided me with many big opportunities that I might not have got anywhere else. Forming a company, getting a patent filed and acquiring funding was way faster and easier here than it would have been elsewhere.
In fact, LifeCradle was a winner at a [email protected] competition hosted by Prince Andrew. It also helped me get into Forbes’ 30 Under 30 Europe.
Coming from a developing nation gives me a whole new perspective. While working here, I always remember the problems faced by people back home. I think people here have an eye for social innovation and they understand the need for products that help society.
My goals are to channel my entrepreneurial spirit into developing a system of sustainable and affordable healthcare at the grassroots, giving back to society. I would love to settle down here. What words do I associate with ‘foreigner’? Strange. Adventure. Exciting.”

“I came to the UK in 2011 to do a master’s in performance design and practice at Central Saint Martins College of Art. It was my dream school. People like John Galliano, Stella McCartney and Alexander McQueen graduated from there.
London is the best place for me because of the mentality, eccentricity and the creativity. I fell in love with British culture and did my best to integrate myself. I have very few French friends. My British boyfriend often says: ‘I have more French friends than you!’
Home is here. I like to pretend I am British. I like to wear bright colours; I don’t have the typical chic Parisian style. As a designer, I love that people can dress up without being judged.
Living abroad has to be exciting. You have to be proactive and make things happen. People are scared of foreigners because it is something they don’t know. But people are not really scared of the dark, they are scared of what could potentially be in the dark. What do I associate with the word ‘foreigner’? Exotic, mysterious, unknown.”

‘We should replace angry climate porn with a positive message’ ","Scare tactics simply aren’t working when it comes to altering our behaviour to tackle climate change, believes Solitaire Townsend, CEO of sustainability consultancy Futerra. Highlighting instead what we stand to gain is something that everyone can get on board with, she writes
David Leonhardt writing in the New York Times recently called for a new climate narrative. Reacting to President Trump’s decision to withdraw from the Paris Agreement, he asked: “What would a more politically persuasive message about climate change sound like?” This is a good question. And the answer might come from a surprising source.
In the 1940s a famous salesman named Elmer Wheeler made what Time magazine called “a handsome living” by advising US businesses “don’t sell the sausage – sell the sizzle!” Wheeler knew that the big secret to successful selling is that you don’t advertise the sausage itself – because actual sausages are made from intestine, fat and the bits of pig that are only fit for grinding up. Instead, it’s the sizzling sounds and smells which get the juices flowing and the people buying. This is the secret to sales.
And right now, climate change is the pig gut. It doesn’t sizzle.
Which isn’t surprising when the most common message on climate change is that we’re all going to hell. That’s what climate change looks like when you get right down to it: rising seas, scorched earth, failing food supplies, billions of starving refugees tormented by wild weather. And hell, simply doesn’t sell. Although these Armageddon climate scenarios might be eye-catching, they haven’t changed attitudes or behaviours nearly enough. Threats of climate hell haven’t seemed to hold us back from running headlong towards it. So, what if we looked at climate change not as a scientist’s problem – but as a salesman’s problem?
First, we need to stop the angry climate porn. The gratuitous and guilt-wrenching images of a planet in meltdown. Even if the fear of the climate curse keeps you up at night. Even if you’re bloody furious at Trump. Even if you want to shake people by the shoulders and scream “don’t you get it, we’re going to lose everything on this gamble!” Remember Shakespeare’s quote: “the nature of bad news infects the teller”.
Instead, we need to take a deep breath and find another way. At Futerra we like to sell the sizzle. We believe in a climate narrative that changes hearts, minds and even behaviours. An approach needed now more than ever before. And it’s the opposite of climate hell. Because what people want now is to imagine better. And better is exactly what we’ll get if we start to properly tackle climate change.
Because almost everything we must do to solve climate change happens to solve something else. Cutting down on air pollution will cure so many health problems, especially asthma in our children. Moving towards renewable energy will make countries energy-independent and avoid oil-induced conflicts and wars. Solar panels cut carbon emissions and, better than any other type of modern fuel, they can bring light and hope to the poorest or most isolated people. Green energy isn’t just green; it’s now cheaper to source in many places in the world.
What if we looked at climate change not as a scientist’s problem – but as a salesman’s problem?
Building a new climate-friendly infrastructure is a massive task and will mean millions of new jobs and even entire new industries. In our own lives, we know that saving energy saves money. Electric cars cut oil use and cost much less to run (while accelerating like a jet). The Lancet medical journal has even published a series of papers over the last decade proving that a ‘low-meat and high-vegetable’ diet would radically cut the carbon dioxide in our atmosphere. It also happens to be exactly the diet they recommend to protect your heart, slim your waistline and add years to your life. So, from our health to our homes and jobs, taking positive action on climate change, be it large or small, seems to come with big practical paybacks.
This reward message could even work for Trump followers by promising jobs and ways to secure communities’ future. The climate action message is ultimately one of independence, freedom and happiness.
But this isn’t only a political message, it’s also a personal one. In 2006, UK research group ESRC reviewed more than 100 studies of how people change their behaviour for the better. They found that the least effective behavioural motivator was fear or regret. Which is why leaders like the former UN chief climate negotiator Christiana Figueres call themselves ‘stubborn optimists who will never give up’.
She’s one of the new climate optimists. Like Richard Branson who calls climate change ‘the greatest entrepreneurial opportunity of a generation’. This is a growing community of people who don’t just believe we can win. But that winning comes with the promise of a better future.
What people want now is to imagine better
A whopping 81 per cent of Donald Trump’s supporters think life has worsened in the past 50 years. Among Britons who voted to leave the European Union, 61 per cent believe that most children will be worse off than their parents. So, the promise that fighting climate change comes with built in rewards might change more than just policy, it could change politics itself.
The new story of climate change is a story of adventure. Our chance to overcome a great monster, and snatch our reward from its jaws.

How little woolly hats fight social isolation ","Since 2003, dedicated crafters up and down the UK have been knitting miniature woolly hats to sit atop bottles of innocent smoothies. More than six million hats later, the Big Knit has raised more than £2 million to help Age UK be there for older people. We unravel the story behind a cosy solution to the very real problem of social isolation
From unicorns to badgers, and from toadstools to Tyrannosaurus rex, creativity knows no bounds when it comes to the Big Knit knitters. In the past 14 years, inventive volunteers have knitted and purled more than 6 million tiny hats, all destined for the top of bottles of innocent smoothies up and down the country.
For each behatted bottle sold, innocent gives 25p to Age UK to help fund vital local and national services that combat loneliness. More than £2 million has been raised to date, and this October’s Big Knit is set to be the biggest ever.
It may seem a distant problem as you grab your lunchtime juice or smoothie, but social isolation is a huge issue for people in later life. In the UK, 3.9 million older people say TV is their main form of company, while 200,000 older people report that they haven’t had a conversation with friends or family for a month.
Over the years, we have received a range of really amazing hand-knitted hats through the doors of Fruit Towers
Age UK is the country’s largest charity dedicated to helping people make the most out of later life, and tackling loneliness is among their priorities. As innocent’s PR manager Eleanor O’Leary explains, the partnership made complete sense: “The Big Knit helps to fund Age UK centres where older people can enjoy things like quizzes, group lunches and dance classes. They are a social lifeline to thousands of older people, providing them with something that everyone, young or old, can relate to – the joy of friendship – and we wanted to share that with as many people as possible.”
June, one of the real-life stars of a video created to spread word of this year’s Big Knit, explains how loneliness crept in when her husband passed away. “My husband and I had been together since we were kids,” she says. “I was 13 when we met, he was 15. Very soon after I moved here [the house in which June lives now] my husband was taken ill, and passed away. If you’ve never been on your own, it’s very difficult.”
She discovered company at an Age UK centre where she and likeminded friend Eleonore chat over a pot of tea, share jokes and occasionally have a dance.
“Having company, to share things with and have a giggle with, makes life sweet again,” says June. “We have a ball. We have a really good time. With Age UK, you’re never alone.”
The knitting community, from experienced needle-clackers to novices, has risen to the Big Knit challenge with enthusiasm. Their designs range from the cosy to the quirky: from striped bobble hats in all colours of the rainbow, to fox and monkey hats, designs made from crocheted ‘granny squares’, post boxes, pumpkins, and even a woollen Usain Bolt, complete with his signature victory pose.
“Over the years, we have received a range of really amazing hand-knitted hats through the doors of Fruit Towers,” says O’Leary, “including Mr Men characters, emojis, ‘woolter-melons’ and even unicorns. Every hat makes a difference and goes towards helping Age UK with the very important work they do.”
They are a social lifeline to thousands of older people, providing them with something that everyone, young or old, can relate to – the joy of friendship
Important work it is, and Age UK is not the only group tackling it head on. There are face-to-face and telephone befriending projects, such as those run by the Royal Voluntary Service, British Red Cross and the 24-hour, free helpline for information and companionship, The Silver Line. The Campaign to End Loneliness is a network of national, regional and local organisations and people who want loneliness to be acted upon as a public health priority. They campaign on issues connected with loneliness, as well as collecting and sharing research. As the group points out, many people are already working to end loneliness across the country, neighbours, families, friends, charities, businesses, post offices, pubs and hobby and sports groups, whether they’re aware of it or not.
The Big Knit is also, in itself, a way of getting people together: many people meet up to take part in sociable crafting sessions, with some groups producing hundreds of hats in total.
“We’re so proud of everything it’s achieved,” says O’Leary, “and incredibly grateful for the support we receive from the brilliant knitting community.”

Gemma: “It’s a huge community effort. Everyone gets involved”
Gemma runs a shop in Oswestry, Shropshire, which has been a collection point for Big Knit hats for the last three years. She hosts a knit-along in her shop to get things started, and each year the challenge is to beat the previous year’s total – they’ve gone from 827 hats in 2011 to a whopping 2,800 in 2013. The hats come in from all over: from knitting groups, from a lady in a nursing home, and last year from a seven-year-old boy, who contributed his first ever bit of knitting.
Ali and Marion: “We absolutely love knitting”
Retired teachers Ali and Marion knit together in Gosport, Hampshire, and between them they’ve contributed 2,500 hats for The Big Knit over the years. “I’m not an expert; I never knit tension squares,” admits Ali, and Marion adds that they make up the patterns as they go along. The ladies are members of the Priddy Purlers knitting group. When not knitting hats, you’ll find Marion attending music festivals with her husband in their motorhome, and Ali whipping up another sweater for her husband, ‘Jumper Joe.’
Hina: “The Big Knit is a way to give back to the community”
Hina is the director of Bluebird Care Lambeth, based in London. She introduced her team to the Big Knit last year, and she’s even managed to get her 10-year-old son into knitting. Hina learned her skills from her mum, who always made her sweaters – “with zig-zag patterns and bobbles all over, my friends were always well jel”, she claims – and this year she started early, recruiting all of her staff to create 100 little hats.
Marjorie: “I like the Big Knit because it provides an income for Age UK Bromley and Greenwich
Marjorie’s been knitting for 75 years. She attends local knitting groups and always has her knitting with her, so she can whip up a little hat on the bus on the way to the shops. She’s knitted hundreds of hats over the years, including snowmen, cups of tea and owls, as well as hats embellished with pompoms, bells and beads. These days Marjorie goes into a school with her local Age UK and teaches children to knit, something she loves to do.
Jo: “I’m obsessed with knitting. I’m rarely without my needles”
Jo knitted a lot when she was younger, but had got out of the habit. She’d do “an occasional baby jacket, but nothing really” – until she found out about The Big Knit through Facebook in 2011. Since then, there’s been no stopping her. She’s made close friends through knitting the little hats, and shares her knitting patterns with friends online. Her favourite hat pattern? Ollie the Octopus. “I immediately fell in love with him.”
Sew good: 5 other inspiring craft-for-social-change projects
A Positive Note
A collaboration between mental health charity Mind and the Craftivist Collective, A Positive Note asks stitchers to send messages to their MP, asking them to help improve the lives of people with mental health problems. But these are no ordinary missives: the notes should be positive and constructive in tone, and stitched – which is a great way to get your message noticed by busy MPs, says Sarah Corbett from the Craftivist Collective. “The collaboration is a ‘gentle protest’ approach to craftivism,” she says, “encouraging quiet, reflective crafting to produce something beautiful and useful to give to your MP to encourage them to use their power for good.”
Knit for Peace
Knit for Peace matches knitters with good causes. ‘Send us your knitting, and we’ll put it to good use at home and abroad,’ say those at the London-based charity. As the winter draws in, the team is particularly in need of warm adult clothes, bed socks, scarves, adult hats and large blankets, either knitted or crocheted. They offer patterns on their website, but also welcome knitters’ own designs. Donations are sent to hospitals, women’s refuges, refugee drop-in centres, community groups and hospices, and donations of yarn and needles are passed on to allow people on low incomes to knit.
A Heart for Your Sleeve
Image: Craftivist Collective
Climate change can feel overwhelming, and impossible to solve. Crafting is one way to be an ‘eco warrior’ rather than a ‘weary worrier’. A Heart for Your Sleeve urges people to hand stitch green hearts to celebrate planet Earth in support of The Climate Coalition’s #fortheloveof campaign.
“Our world is amazing,” says Corbett from the Craftivist Collective. “It blooms with remarkable people, with art that can make us laugh, cry and even change our world view, with technology that can connect us to our loved ones on the other side of the world. To make and wear your green handmade heart on your sleeve is a small, positive, beautiful and therefore influential and powerful act.”
You Are So Very Beautiful
A campaign that was sparked on the internet, but manifests itself in real life is You Are So Very Beautiful. Crafters are encouraged to make a small sign that contains an affirmation beginning with the words ‘You are…’ before leaving it for an unsuspecting recipient to find. Signs can be placed on window ledges, bus seats, under the edge of flower pots – anywhere you feel needs an injection of goodwill. The challenge has already been taken up in the UK, US, Canada and Australia.
Solidarity Bunting

Challenge injustice – and nurture its champions of tomorrow – via bunting, recommends Sarah Corbett, the ‘queen of craftivism’. She came up with Solidarity Bunting as a way to get kids thinking about how they can be in solidarity with people to improve our world. “It is a way to encourage the new craftivists to think about or discuss ways they can show solidarity for everyone from a child being bullied at school to the farmers who grow the bananas they might eat for breakfast,” she says."

Why aren’t ‘organic carrots’ just called ‘carrots’? ","How we describe something can transform how we view it. Lauren Bravo wraps her tongue around the small linguistic tweaks that can have a big impact
These are busy times for words. Language is evolving faster than ever, and social media has made publishers of us all. But among the buzzwords and political doublespeak, language still wields real power. The smallest linguistic alterations can create powerful, positive changes in the way we view things, even ourselves.
This year, researchers from the University of Carolina, along with colleagues at Colgate University and Penn State, found that asking participants to consider ‘people in a group’ rather than ‘a group of people’, made them much more likely to think about the subject’s thoughts and feelings. Make that ‘a group of refugees’, or less empathetically, ‘migrants’, and we begin to recognise the dehumanising effect of a thousand tabloid headlines.
It’s a neat trick; the language flip. It forces us to dig up the systemic defaults buried deep in our culture, and give them a good airing. Do they still represent us? Did they ever, really? We’re seeing it in agriculture: “I think we need to take back our language. I want to call my organic carrots ‘carrots’ and let [other farmers] call theirs a chemical carrot,” argues organic farmer (sorry, ‘farmer’) Mary Jane Butters in an interview on organic.org. Language puts the burden of proof on certain groups, but it can likewise move it just as easily.
What about when it comes to gender equality? Game of Thrones star Maisie Williams declared in an interview with Entertainment Weekly: “We should stop calling feminists ‘feminists’ and just start calling people who aren’t feminist ‘sexist’ – and then everyone else is just a human. You are either a normal person or a sexist”.
For those of us who wearily had the ‘feminism means equality for everyone!’ conversation one too many times, it makes sense. Could we make the whole movement opt-out, rather than opt-in?
Sometimes it isn’t so much about changing words, as redefining them. Take ‘nude’ – the fashion term used to describe everything from shoes to lipstick. It is only really nude if you fall on the Caucasian, peachy-beige part of the colour chart (see also: ‘flesh-coloured’ plasters). But change is finally afoot; Christian Louboutin’s Nudes collection featured the designer’s trademark stilettos in five inclusive shades, while ethical lingerie brands Naja and Nubian Skin make underwear and hosiery that women of colour can truly call ‘nude’. It’s an important step forward for diversity, but it’s also barefaced good business.
We should stop calling feminists ‘feminists’ and just start calling people who aren’t feminist ‘sexist’
And even the most important ideas still need the right sales patter. Anthropologist Jason Hickel
proposes a radical overhaul in global development – starting with the word itself. We need to stop focusing on growth, and start ‘de-developing’ the world’s richest nations to a more sustainable level instead. Plenty of countries, he points out, have life expectancies and happiness levels comparable with the US and western Europe, but with only a fraction of the wealth and waste.
Only we can’t say ‘de-developing’, of course, because who’s going to sign up for that? In a system that values the biggest, richest, fastest and fanciest, how do you persuade people that smaller, slower and simpler isn’t actually a downgrade, but a much-needed modification?
Well, perhaps by calling it ‘mindful’. Maybe you sell it as a ‘detox’ or a ‘consumption cleanse’. It’s no secret that the millennials love a pithy rebrand – call toast ‘chargrilled bread’ and we’ll order it excitedly from a brunch menu. But while some might scoff at modern vernacular, we should let language lead us into new mindsets. Could we embrace South America’s philosophy of buen vivir, putting community good above the individual – or revive the Greek eudaimonia, Aristotle’s term for human flourishing?
Consider the hype around hygge last year; the Danish word that means a feeling of cosy contentment (or expensive homewares, depending on who you ask). Cynics might say all we did with hygge was purloin it to flog candles and cinnamon buns, but for frazzled, over-stimulated Brits, I think the appeal ran much deeper. Maybe sometimes you don’t realise what you’re missing until there’s a word for it.

The sex workers who are stopping HIV ","Sex workers in Mozambique are providing health support to those at the margins of society. They face political and financial challenges, but against the odds they are helping thousands
It’s late when we reach Inhamízua on the outskirts of the city. Stalls sell crackling chicken feet and sizzling plantain. Scores of men and women are gathered by a makeshift bar topped with corrugated steel. Spirits are high. The sound of laughter rises above the rumble of trucks trundling by.
Light from the petrol station across the road illuminates the scene. Some of the women sit on white plastic chairs, nursing infants. It’s a nativity scene of sorts, set under coconut trees with Marrabenta-style dance music surging from a battered loudspeaker.
Luisa* and I walk behind the bar, through dried mud and over shards of glass and used condoms. We’re at the huts now. It’s 80 meticais for five minutes – about a pound. A bottle of beer in this town, to put things in context, costs 55.
In Beira, like everywhere else, sex sells – and there’s a good chance that HIV will be part of the transaction. Truckers drive here along the trade corridor that stretches from Zimbabwe’s eastern border. The end of their journey is a Mozambican port city where life expectancy is less than 50 and HIV rates are among the highest in the world. When they leave, that legacy often follows them.
One in ten adults in Mozambique is HIV positive, making the country’s HIV prevalence the eighth highest globally. But while the government has made progress on controlling the epidemic in recent years, reaching the marginalised along the Beira corridor has remained difficult.
How do you reach a population that is perpetually mobile? A population fearful of police intimidation, or of being found out by friends and family? In their eyes, they have little to gain from meeting you and everything to lose. To reach them, you need an innovative approach.
On we go, Luisa and I and the others, to place after place late into the night. Hotspots they call them, each one the same – makeshift bars with white plastic chairs, pumping music, overturned trucks, stacks of old tyres, broken beer bottles, and every time those huts out back.

Luisa is a peer educator – part of a team that dispenses medical advice to the local community – but will return to these streets as a sex worker when money is low.
Her story is the story of this project. For here in Beira, I’ve discovered a group helping people to help themselves – even as Mozambique threatens to fall back into the political chaos of its past. Amid the discord, this project is countering the seeming inevitability of contracting HIV along the transport corridor by enabling sex workers to become peer educators for a couple of nights each week, sometimes more. Joined by counsellors and outreach workers, they provide safe-sex guidance, offer advice on family planning, and deliver on-the-spot HIV testing. They distribute condoms and lubricants. And, crucially, they connect some 3,800 sex workers and 4,500 long-distance truck drivers to health clinics they might otherwise never visit.
This is the Corridor Project, established by Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) in January 2014. And despite its perilous situation, it’s reaching the unreachable.
The story of Mozambique’s HIV epidemic is embedded in its history of bloodshed. After a decade of armed struggle, Mozambique gained independence from Portugal in June 1975. Hundreds of thousands of Portuguese fled, including many who worked in healthcare. By Independence Day, just 80 doctors remained in the whole of the country.
The Mozambique Liberation Front (FRELIMO) came to power, but inherited a fractured country with a fragile infrastructure and few skilled workers. Within two years a brutal civil war had broken out, with FRELIMO violently confronted by the Resistência Nacional Moçambicana (RENAMO), an armed and much-feared rebel movement. Over the next 15 years, up to a million died and 10 per cent of the country’s population became war refugees.
Yet as HIV ravaged neighbouring countries, Mozambique was shielded by limited population movement into the country.
A peace agreement was eventually reached in 1992, and with international help the government began to focus on improving the country’s main transport corridors to restore economic growth. Ripe for development was the Beira corridor, spanning the 300km from the Indian Ocean to Zimbabwe’s eastern border. Previously marred by dilapidated infrastructure, staff shortages and bandit attacks, transport links from Beira’s rehabilitated port soon stretched to surrounding countries.
Mozambique was open for business. But development came at a cost. When populations become more mobile, so do sexually transmitted infections like HIV. Long-distance drivers, for example, are more likely to engage in transactional sex, with a string of partners. They frequently make overnight stops, arriving with money to spend in the midst of poorer communities.
Within 15 years of its first, solitary case, one million people in Mozambique were living with HIV
And so, after the civil war, truck drivers often carried HIV from stop to stop along the Beira corridor until they reached their families at home. Sex workers followed the money. And HIV followed them all.
Meanwhile, refugees returned from neighbouring countries – another factor believed to have contributed to a rise in HIV rates. Mozambique’s first case was reported in 1986. By the end of 1992, there had been 662 confirmed cases. By 1998 that number had risen to 10,863.
These spiralling rates partly represented improved diagnostics, but the figures went far beyond this. Within 15 years of that first, solitary case, one million people in Mozambique were living with HIV.
Yet solid political and economic reforms had led Mozambique to become one of the fastest-growing economies in Africa, with GDP growth of seven per cent per annum. The government prioritised HIV prevention and treatment, and international donors stepped forward. The number of people on HIV treatment grew 37-fold between 2004 and 2013.
By mid-2016, about 900,000 people living with HIV were receiving antiretroviral treatment, three times as many as in 2012. Expanded treatment coverage for pregnant women living with HIV resulted in a 73 per cent decline in new infections among children in just three years. New HIV infections among adults dropped by 40 per cent from 2004 to 2014.
Mozambique had become a shining example of how to battle an HIV epidemic. Yet there was a missing piece in the puzzle. Its HIV success story did not extend to the Beira corridor – it didn’t even come close.
The Corridor Project is not about one organisation. It’s really about 300
Our group receives a warm welcome at our next stop – Pinta Boca’s Premium Bar. Many of the peer educators are familiar faces here.
Luisa carries a notebook and collects the telephone numbers of sex workers who want to be called during the week with advice on how and where to get antiretroviral drugs. “Quanto custa?” asks one woman standing by a pool table, its legs embedded deep in the mud and cues nowhere to be seen. “They’re free,” Luisa replies, adding that yes, she can get refills at the clinic if she has run out. “And TB treatment, too?” she asks. “Sure,” Luisa says. She’ll call her tomorrow with advice.
The pages of Luisa’s notebook are filling up fast.
A man drinking a bottle of Impala beer approaches one of the women sitting on a white plastic chair by the roadside. She passes her baby gently to a fellow worker and walks towards the huts with the truck driver. A ‘rapidinha’, they call it – a quickie.
Jaime – a counsellor from MSF – has joined us tonight. He knows this crowd well, too. As he bounces one of the infants on his knee, a ‘camionista’, a long-distance truck driver, steps forward. “Can I have the test?” he asks. Jaime walks him towards the van and the man gets an HIV test there and then. A preliminary result follows 15 minutes later. If his test is later confirmed as positive, he will join the 1.5 million others in Mozambique living with HIV at the last count.
We end up back in the van – now 144 red condoms lighter, each 53 millimetres wide and made of natural latex rubber. Luisa and others like her are just the right people to be here: better suited than well-meaning outsiders who, without relatable experiences, might never be able to connect with those at risk in such a profoundly personal way.
Luisa, 29 years old and a mother of five, tells me that her ex left her soon after she was gang-raped. The attack gave her HIV. For her, it was too late. But not for these women, she believes.
By the end of this week, her notebook will be full.

It’s fair to say there was an endless amount of bargaining to get the MSF Corridor Project off the ground – and no better woman to contend with this than its Brazilian coordinator, Daniela Cerqueira Batista.
A background in psychology, Daniela is effortlessly glamorous in a Goan beach sort of way. There are kisses on either cheek and arms flung around those she meets. Her messages have more emojis than mine have characters. Her energy is resolutely undiminished by this oppressive heat, despite managing a team of 90 here in Beira.
When she saw how expensive books were at a local sale here, she set about trying to establish a library. When she couldn’t find a Pride flag, she picked up a multicoloured umbrella back in Brazil, which now forms an improvised Pride symbol stuck above the front door of MSF’s Beira headquarters on Rua Dom Francisco Gorjão.
It took meeting after meeting to set up the Corridor Project – with local NGOs, transport sector representatives, law enforcement agencies, Ministry of Health officials, truckers’ unions, border community representatives and customs personnel. Add to that input from donors and funding institutions, including the US President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), the Global Fund and many others.
The Corridor Project is not about one organisation. It’s really about 300. In a country of 43 languages. But these alliances ultimately proved fruitful, explains Daniela, establishing firm links with port companies who hold staff education sessions, community theatre groups who put on productions with safe-sex themes, and organisations who run workshops on domestic abuse. And the project would be incomplete without its linkage to care – the health centres at Ponta Gêa and Munhava.
Some lessons you just won’t find in textbooks. In the early days, those working as part of the project wore MSF T-shirts but were shunned – sex workers and truck drivers associated the charity solely with HIV care and didn’t approach the peer educators in case others thought they were HIV positive. Staff at the health centres soon learned to dispense antiretroviral drugs in boxes that had fake labels – that way, patients could go home with a box that looked like it was just full of painkillers.
They want to change their own lives and help their sisters on the streets
Mobile clinics have now been established along the corridor, with adapted opening times; sex workers and truck drivers work unconventional hours. MSF counsellors and peer educators make door-to-door visits and stop by 200 hotspots along the corridor. And their staff support care at government health centres so that stigma and discrimination do not drive these marginalised populations away. The Corridor Project now stretches across Mozambique and has been extended to Malawi and Zimbabwe.
More recently, MSF has introduced health passports for all patients diagnosed with HIV who are on treatment. Containing test results and medication regimens, they allow for continuity of care along the corridor. MSF are working to have these multilingual passports recognised in Zimbabwe and Malawi – if they are successful, patients could receive uninterrupted HIV treatment across borders.
Then there are the peer educators. At those makeshift bars, it’s Luisa and the others who engender a sense of genuine trust, connection, camaraderie and solidarity. They’ve been there; sometimes they still are. Back at Rua Dom Francisco Gorjão, they’re involved in all aspects of the project – design, implementation, decision making and oversight, at the community level and nationally. Luisa has a chance, if she wants it, to progress through the organisation; several peer educators have become counsellors. Others have been supported to set up their own businesses.
Luisa receives remuneration for her peer educator role. I ask Sebastiana Cumbe, supervisor of psychological support, how this factors into sex workers signing up to this project. “Yes, there is a salary,” she tells me. “But it’s not just that. They want to change their own lives and help their sisters on the streets.”
Not many projects provide that linkage to care, a bridge between community and clinic. A 2016 study assessed healthcare programmes for sub-Saharan African truck drivers in 30 countries. Of 22 programmes, only three covered testing and care for conditions other than HIV, such as TB and malaria. Few tested for other STIs. Just more than half have been evaluated to date. Where data has been gathered, it primarily focuses on the number of sites established, staff trained, resources used or clients reached. It’s one thing to give out condoms, but another thing for people to use them. Few projects have reported on impact indicators such as changes in infection rates.
In 2016, 71 per cent of the HIV-negative sex workers in the Corridor Project were retested at least once, with 94 per cent still HIV negative when retested. It’s these sorts of metrics that should help scale up and sustain the programme. If, that is, the project can weather the political challenges faced by Mozambique, both now and in the future.

“You’re sick,” Luisa’s partner had said to her. He had just found out that she had been raped. Then, he left her.
She had already been a sex worker for some time when it happened. Her first child had been born when Luisa was 14; her second, four years later. So she became the family breadwinner when her partner couldn’t get a job.
She remembers her first day on the streets. Overcome by shame when she saw a neighbour, she ran home before a single transaction. But two days later, with no food for her children, she returned.
She always ensured her clients wore condoms, even though they would pay more if they didn’t have to. The ones who refused, she refused them too. She remained HIV negative.
I would have been more ashamed if I had to beg my friends for money. This was a conscious decision
“Half the money now,” the client had said that night. “Half the money after we have sex.” He wanted her to travel away from the huts. In the car, he phoned his friends.
“He took out a gun and told me, ‘Get out,’ and I did. He told me to take my clothes off and I did. His friends arrived. They had sex with me, five people. But they didn’t use a condom. Afterwards, he left me there. I had no strength left, and then I took my clothes, I hitched a ride and went to the hospital.”
Luisa’s internal and external injuries were so severe that she was unable to work for another six months. She was tested again, not too long after. She was HIV positive.
Worldwide, sex workers are 12 times as likely as the general population to be HIV positive. Across 16 sub-Saharan African countries surveyed in 2012, the prevalence of HIV among sex workers was 37 per cent.
“When I was sick,” Luisa tells me, “my children ended up not going to school because I couldn’t afford paying for the school truck, because I didn’t have money left. MSF always came to take me to the hospital, to do everything. I didn’t have anything left to eat because I couldn’t go on the streets. They gave me a letter and I went to collect food, even when I said I had HIV. And I started to take some medicine. Slowly, I recovered.”
Luisa has five children now, aged between two and fourteen.
She became an MSF peer educator two years ago. As she walks through that dried mud and over those shards of glass, I see something in her. Energy. Empathy. A need to be there for others the way others were there for her.
She works less frequently on the streets than she did before. But she does not regret her choices. “I would have been more ashamed if I had to beg my friends for money. This was a conscious decision. When my heart tells me to do something, I do it.”

Back at Rua Dom Francisco Gorjão, I meet 22-year-old Antonio*. He explains how the Corridor Project reaches out to other at-risk populations, not just those connected to sex work. Similar strategies are used for each group, despite their differences.
Antonio knew as a child in Maputo that he was different from his friends. Or at least he was made to feel different. As he played with dolls and cookery sets, his stepmother told him to play with cars, to make friends with boys instead of girls. In his teens he was sent to live in Beira with his cousins. “Here I felt comfortable,” he says. “I was able to paint my nails, freely wear make-up and dresses.” He was sometimes bullied at school. But Beira became his home.
His journey with his own family has been more difficult. He visited his sister’s house recently with a gay female friend. Afterwards, his sister said if she were to discover her daughters were gay, she would murder them with her own hands.
Antonio works as a peer educator for men who have sex with men (MSM). Globally, gay men and other MSM are 19 times more likely to be living with HIV than the general population. A recent Beira study found a third of MSM over the age of 25 are living with HIV.
Another study from 2015 suggested a third of MSM in Beira had never been tested for HIV. Fourteen per cent of those said that this was because they simply did not know where to go.
These interventions are a necessary first step. The larger question is what can we do to remove stigma and other barriers?
With such high HIV rates in Beira’s MSM, the cornerstone of MSF’s work here is to scale up preventative strategies. This is where PrEP comes in – pre-exposure prophylaxis. By taking a certain combination of drugs in one daily tablet, people can reduce their risk of contracting HIV by more than 90 per cent. (It does not protect against other STIs, and missing doses decreases its effectiveness.)
José Carlos Beirão manages the PrEP Operational Research Project, established within the Corridor Project in 2016, and the only one of its kind in Mozambique. So far 214 participants, MSM as well as female sex workers, have been recruited, with a target of 250. Beirão hopes that by the end of the project, he’ll be able to understand the demand for PrEP and the feasibility and acceptability of implementing a wide-scale PrEP programme.
I ask Ken Ho, an HIV specialist and prominent PrEP researcher at the University of Pittsburgh, whether he thinks the corridor approach might be applicable to settings far outside Beira.
“We know that young black MSM are disproportionally impacted by HIV,” he explains. “These are the same people who may have limited access to healthcare because of lack of insurance, distrust of medical institutions, or fear of stigmatisation.” And so, he sees the corridor approach as being relevant in the USA, at least initially in establishing a link with difficult-to-reach populations.
But he sounds a note of caution: “The risk is that these targeted interventions function more like Band-Aids and allow – perhaps even encourage – the underlying problems to persist. So I think they are a necessary first step. The larger question is what can we do to remove stigma and other barriers that are responsible for the disparities in the first place?”
Antonio’s confidence has grown since his schooldays, he tells me. For him, it’s about visibility. When he arrived in Beira, nobody looked like him. Now he sees others who do. Boys growing up today, he believes, will have a chance to think differently because of this: I see it, I can be it.
I am outside Beira’s airport, right where José Manuel was shot dead in April 2016. He was a RENAMO member of the National Council for Defence and Security. Formerly the civil war rebels, RENAMO are now the opposition party. Human Rights Watch noted reports that it had taken the police ten hours to arrive on the scene.
Armed conflict resumed in Mozambique in 2015, after two decades of peace. The results of the 2014 general election, won by FRELIMO, were bitterly contested by RENAMO. There were summary executions of villagers, abductions and sexual violence, political assassinations, raids on health clinics, attacks on civilian buses, and even reports of mass graves.
Mozambique was in danger of plunging back into the chaos of its past. Faced with violence from both sides, more than 11,000 Mozambicans fled to Malawi and Zimbabwe. By the end of 2016, a truce had been agreed, and most of the refugees had returned, but many families remain internally displaced.
In 2016 economic growth halved, with a downturn in commodity prices. And then there was an astonishing and ultimately devastating admission from the government: it had guaranteed $1.5 billion (£1.2bn) in secret, unconstitutional loans. Fourteen donor countries and multilateral institutions – including the UK, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank – promptly suspended direct support to the state budget. The foreign debt burden has risen to $9.9bn (£7.7bn) – up 20 per cent a year over the last five years.
By the beginning of 2017, cholera outbreaks had become so common that they were barely making the national news. The cost of bread and other staples was rising. The currency was falling. Nurses were not being paid. The ceasefire is still holding, but uneasily so.
Ordinary people in Mozambique are paying a high price. It is possible the Corridor Project will, too.
The average Mozambican’s daily struggle remains to lift themselves out of poverty
Health infrastructure is already in a perilous state. There are only three doctors per 100,000 people, one of the worst ratios in the world. Already more than half the population must walk an hour or more to their nearest health facility. Just over half of health facilities lack electricity and 41 per cent have no running water.
Mozambique expert Alex Vines has been head of the Africa Programme at Chatham House, an international affairs think-tank in London, since 2002. How will recent political and economic developments affect healthcare in Mozambique, I ask him, and in turn the Corridor Project?
Vines points out that the ceasefire is at least indefinite, and that better rains over recent months have provided some economic respite. “But the debt burden – because of the undisclosed loans scandal of 2016 and suspension of direct budget support by international donors – has seriously impacted the government’s finances, and this has a knock-on impact on healthcare and HIV programmes,” he explains.
Mozambique receives more than 95 per cent of its HIV programme funding through international donors. The Corridor Project depends heavily on this funding, and it could suffer profoundly. Vines is hopeful, though: “I believe the international donors will resume their direct support of the government but will require greater accountability. Trust is central to this.”
What happens next to the support of healthcare, and in turn to the Corridor Project, he believes, will partly depend on the outcome of an ongoing independent audit into those murky secret loans. But a question remains, Vines says, about some leading donors. Donald Trump has proposed a cut in US global health funding, which will affect projects in Mozambique related to family planning. Who will fill those gaps remains unclear. Mozambique’s longstanding status as a donor darling is now far from secure.
Luisa is healthy and optimistic for her future, for the future of her children
The withdrawal of funding for the Corridor Project is something Caroline Rose, MSF’s head of mission in Mozambique, is only too aware of, even at ground level. “In the field we are receiving more and more requests from health facilities in trouble: ‘Could you fix our ambulance?’ ‘Could you transport our drugs from our clinic to the districts?’ ‘Could you pay for fuel?’” She is negotiating with international donors to the project, encouraging them to implement interim funding strategies until more long-term solutions are ironed out.
Vines envisages that the country will have a difficult few years before large-scale exporting of gas reserves starts, in the mid-2020s. Mozambique is now entering another election cycle that will doubtless be contentious, and which will likely span the next two years. “Meanwhile, the average Mozambican’s daily struggle remains to lift themselves out of poverty.”
And so, women like Luisa will continue to walk towards those huts each night. They will take further risks to feed their families. As Mozambique’s uncertain future unfolds, ventures like the Corridor Project will be needed more than ever.

Luisa is healthy and optimistic for her future, for the future of her children. The corridor is where she has found, at different times, a livelihood, unspeakable trauma, a feeling of community and now a sense of purpose. In some ways it has defined her life, even as it has endangered it.
In 2014, the Corridor Project was established to reach the unreachable. Night by night, hotspot by hotspot, from one gas station to the next. It’s early days, but already it has connected with thousands of sex workers and truck drivers. Preliminary figures suggest this is giving a significant boost to HIV prevention and treatment. And the project refuses to fade even in the face of precarious funding streams and a deeply fractious political climate.
The night is over for us. In a few hours, the sun will rise. Traders will set up their stalls at Mercado do Goto to hawk fruit and vegetables. Fishermen will repair their nets by Macúti beach lighthouse, their wooden boats pulled high up onto the sand. Luisa will walk her children to school. Daniela will fling open the doors of her office under the Pride umbrella. The Corridor Project will live to see another day.

Seeking the truth: 5 leading investigative reporting outlets ","Though the shifting sands of modern media make investigative journalism challenging, it is still going strong. Here is our pick of five organisations that specialise in digging deeper
The Bureau of Investigative Journalism
Stories broken by the London-based media organisation The Bureau of Investigative Journalism have prompted official inquiries in the UK, EU and US; influenced changes to British policy on refugees, housebuilding, resistance to antibiotics, and care homes; and led to greater openness about civilian casualties in the US’s covert drone war. They say: “Our journalists dig deep, and will spend months getting to the truth if that’s what it takes.”
Global Witness
For two decades, Global Witness has campaigned for transparency in the mining, logging, oil and gas sectors. Its team works to expose the links between demand for natural resources, corruption, armed conflict and environmental destruction. Global Witness investigators deploy undercover journalism, financial analysis and secret filming, and often work with likeminded organisations.
The International Consortium of Investigative Journalists
A global network of 190 investigative journalists in more than 65 countries, The International Consortium of Investigative Journalists cooperate on in-depth stories. Founded in 1997, the ICIJ was instrumental in the biggest journalistic collaboration in history: based on the 11.5m leaked ‘Panama Papers’. “The need for such an organisation has never been greater,” it says.

The Intercept
Co-founded by Glenn Greenwald, Laura Poitras and Jeremy Scahill, US-based investigative journalism outfit The Intercept aims to hold powerful governmental and corporate institutions to account. It has reported extensively on covert surveillance, national security, civil liberties and the environment, among other issues, and is published by First Look Media Works, a company that supports independent voices.

The Storm Lake Times
Family-run US newspaper The Storm Lake Times has a staff of just 10 but won a Pulitzer Prize earlier this year for taking on powerful agricultural companies over farm pollution. The newspaper helped force the release of documents that proved that huge agricultural companies secretly helped fund the local government’s defence of a big environmental lawsuit. Art Cullen owns the Storm Lake Times, along with his brother John.

Growing a movement: 25 years of Permaculture magazine ","In September 1992, Maddy and Tim Harland published the first issue of Permaculture magazine. On the publication’s 25th anniversary, we find out how far they – and the permaculture movement – have come
How did Permaculture magazine begin?
When Tim and I published the first issue of Permaculture magazine it had a tiny readership of 800 people, mainly Permaculture Association members, our national education charity and students of permaculture design courses, but we had a vision that permaculture could go mainstream and so we started supplying shops and other outlets from day one. Today we have about 100,000 readers, are found in shops all over the world, and even have a North American specific edition of the magazine.
What changes have you seen in the movement since you started the magazine?
Back in 1992, permaculture in Britain was a very alternative scene. Yet to come was the understanding of low impact development in English and Welsh planning law thanks to people like [woodsman, coppicer and natural eco-builder] Ben Law and Tony Wrench [author of Building a Low Impact Roundhouse] respectively. Internationally, permaculture people were found in pockets all over the world, but there were only a few charitable foundations and a limited network.
Over the years we have seen permaculture activists working in disaster areas, such as Haiti after the earthquakes, building sanitation systems and providing clean water. Permaculture has become part of the national curriculum in East Timor and a recognised approach to sustainable agriculture, good nutrition and regenerative land management in Malawi. It has become a tool for teaching agriculture and horticulture and training for refugees from Afghanistan and the Middle East. It forms the basis of Gaia Education’s ‘ecological key’, endorsed by The United Nations Institute for Training and Research, and UNESCO.
At the last inter-governmental climate talks in 2016, Baroness Patricia Scotland, the secretary-general of the Commonwealth, referred to permaculture as one of the key approaches to regenerative development to reverse (not just adapt to) climate change. Permaculture is emerging from the alternative fringe to take its place within a portfolio of holistic design solutions.

What has been most challenging about 25 years in publishing, and of what are you most proud?
The most challenging thing is publishing a magazine that is fundamentally opposed to unconscious consumerism. As you know so well at Positive News, we need to sell a certain number of magazines to survive and it is not possible to play the conventional commercial game to get those sales (by corporate advertising sales for yet more consumer disposable products). We rely on our readers’ discrimination and the magnetism of good news, positive, practical, tested solutions and a vision of the future that is regenerative, not degenerative.
Tim and I both love the passion, intelligence, generosity and inventiveness of our writers, advertisers and readers. We love the small team we work with who work so hard on the magazine’s growth and development. We love the emerging vision of the future, a mosaic of many people’s understanding and insights. We can almost hear this future breathing, to use the words of author Arundhati Roy.
Tim and I are proud to be producing a book, Fertile Edges: regenerating land, culture and hope to celebrate our 25 years in print. It is a collection of my editorials over this time contextualised by world events, permaculture happenings and personal biography. We are proud because this collection demonstrates how cutting-edge the permaculture movement has always been and this collection gathers together in one volume so many beautiful ideas, stories and practices that have inspired us both and our readers over the last quarter century.
Why is permaculture particularly relevant now?
The permaculture movement is all about its people. We have specialists in regenerative agriculture who can transform barren lands in all climates. We have people working with refugees teaching skills that will create greater self-reliance and help heal some of the terrible wounds of exile. We have urban permaculturists working with people who feel left behind, people working in developing countries transforming food security, teachers pushing the edges of people care and helping groups to work more effectively together. We have people working on cultural emergence, finding the patterns that will allow new ideas to coalesce and be developed.
Permaculture is a holistic design system based on natural principles. These can be used in so many different contexts. Perhaps the most interesting one to emerge will be a planetary permaculture design using all the tools and strategies we know are effective to lock up carbon in the soil and biomass and reverse climate change. The science says it is possible (read Paul Hawkins’ book, Drawdown). What is required is a deepening sense of urgency coupled with a political understanding that such a design will be regenerative – it will provide food, energy and wellbeing – and not sap it from the system.
But it will also require a step change in the world. I’ll be speaking more of that on Sunday at the London Permaculture Festival.
We rely on the magnetism of good news, positive, practical, tested solutions and a vision of the future that is regenerative, not degenerative
Where do you see permaculture heading in the next 25 years?
I see permaculture becoming a key strategy in climate stabilisation. We need regenerative designers in all areas of life if we are to survive. Permaculture provides a framework to train the next generation in Earth repair. I would urge any young person to find their passion, educate themselves as best they can, and go out into the world with the intention to learn as much as they can for the benefit of their fellow beings, and not just the human ones.
Why are get-togethers such as this weekend’s London Permaculture Festival so important?
The London Permaculture Festival is a key event. It is always packed with great workshops and events so is a prime opportunity for learning new skills and being exposed to new ideas. It is wonderfully diverse – as London is – attended by people of all ages and cultures. Social inclusion is really important for me as it indicates the good health of an organisation or society, and social justice is the compassionate and intelligent way to live. It is also a celebration. There is nothing quite like meeting other social change activists.
We can all spend too much of our time feeling on the edge of society because we think differently and do not buy into the conventional narrative we are sold from birth. The festival is a chance to be with people of like minds, go urban foraging, make new friends, eat excellent food, and breathe in that positive, regenerative future world we all want to create.

Maddy Harland is founder and editor of Permaculture magazine – practical solutions beyond sustainability. Her book, Fertile Edges: regenerating land, culture and hope will be published in September by Permanent Publications.
The London Permaculture Festival takes place at Cecil Sharp House in Camden, London, on Sunday, 30 July.

https://www.positive.news/perspective/blogs/blog/10-things-learned-making-positive-news-magazine-issue-90/,refugee,1049,"July 5, 2017",Lucy Purdy,"
10 things we learned while making Positive News magazine issue 90 ","Issue 90 of Positive News magazine is out now, and it’s our favourite yet. Read on for 10 insights into the latest issue
1) Boys do cry
“All that ‘real men don’t cry bullshit?’ Yeah, we do. Real people cry,” said this issue’s cover star, ‘gangsta gardener’ Ron Finley, when we interviewed him in Los Angeles via Skype. Ron is just one of the people ‘rewriting the man code’ – redefining expectations of what it means to be a man today. For all the difficulties facing men, from mental health issues to concerns over how the automation of jobs is affecting men’s social roles, there are people working on solutions.
Across a 10-page feature in the new issue of Positive News magazine, we speak to those who are breaking down stereotypes and rebuilding brotherhood. Subscribe to get your copy.
2) Aussies love alcohol-themed emojis, but Russians favour romance
While researching our feature about the surprising positives in emojis, we came across some ?-inducing facts. Australians use double the average number of booze-themed symbols, while Russian speakers use three times as many romantic emojis than most. Which nation tops the chart for their use of emojis? C’est un secret! You’ll have to subscribe to find out.
3) Doggy paddle is an acceptable swimming stroke
This comforting fact surfaced as we put together our feature on the rise of mass participation sports. The Great Swim series has urged thousands of people to dip a toe into wild swimming for the first time, while the parkrun phenomenon has created a new breed of people “who didn’t think they were runners – but they are parkrunners”. Fancy limbering up for an uplifting journalistic marathon? Subscribe here and you’ll be sprinting through all the most inspiring stories of the past three months, in one beautifully designed magazine.
4) We need to know what a beautiful future might look like, as well as what’s wrong
“Our cultural problem isn’t the presence of post-apocalyptic storylines, but the virtual absence of images of a good, decent, beautiful future” suggests nature writer Richard Louv in the new issue. Without knowing what a more fulfilling relationship with the natural world could look like, we won’t reach it, he says.
As the first media organisation to take good news seriously, we are committed to rigorous standards. Plus we are a media co-op owned by readers and reinvest all profits into our journalism. Support inspiring, trustworthy journalism by subscribing to Positive News magazine.
5) News can be pun-powered
The Positive News pun team were on form this issue, after we created an infographic about the renewable energy revolution. This double page spread, beautifully designed by the Give Up Art studio, mentions ‘green power’s big fans’ – the nations that are most enthusiastically embracing green energy, and describes how Britain is ‘rocking out’ (giving up coal). It also includes a peppering of ‘alternative (energy) facts’ that we’re sure even President Trump couldn’t argue with.
6) A picture tells a thousand words
This issue, we’ve worked with illustrator ‘Pâté’, also known as Paul Pateman: a graphic artist with a quick wit and a strong, simple aesthetic. Paul came up with the striking illustration for this issue’s feature about factchecking, in which he turned the volume down on a certain person well-associated with ‘fake news’. Paul has also worked with the likes of Time Out New York, The Washington Post, Wired Magazine and Transport for London.
And we also worked again with illustrator and printmaker Spencer Wilson, who devised the playful characters for our ‘Change the story, change the world feature. We sent him your feedback about which cliched media narratives you’d most like to see overturned, and Spencer let rip on some great figures that fly in the face of media stereotypes – from a bungee-jumping granny, to a grinning (non-angry) vegan.
7) Carrots may not really be carrots
‘Why do we call carrots that are grown with pesticides ‘carrots’ but organic carrots ‘organic carrots’? asks journalist Lauren Bravo. Why are flesh-coloured tights named so, when they really only refer to white skin tones? And what would happen if we stopped focusing on global ‘development’, and started ‘de-developing’ the world’s richest nations instead? Crunch away at this food for thought in the latest Positive News magazine.
8) It’s time for another summer of love
Our travel editor Aaron Millar donned his grooviest flares and flowers in his hair to catch up with some of the summer of love’s big characters over in San Francisco. They chewed the fat about the 1960s-utopian dream and why it matters in current political times. “Dream big, but then make those dreams real by living them,” advises Carolyn Garcia, the then-partner of Jerry Garcia from the Grateful Dead. Feeling game for a re-run of the 1967 Human Be-In? Turn on, tune in and sign up to read the feature in full.
9) Investigative journalism is alive and well
As public faith in the mainstream media wobbles like never before, we tracked down five leading investigative reporting outlets. They’re doing inspiring work, from the London-based Bureau of Investigative Journalism which has influenced changes to British policy on refugees, housebuilding and care homes, to the Storm Lake Times: a family-run local newspaper that won a Pulitzer Prize for uncovering the dodgy funding links between agricultural corporate giants and local government. Scoop-tastic.
10) Our community is positively fantastic
This issue, we catch up with the psychiatric ward that is switching to Positive News. NHS occupational therapist Mal Ure explains why she and her colleagues decided to improve patients’ media diets at the psychiatric ward where she works in Somerset.
While we fire up the coffee machine and toil late into the night to meet our print deadline: your support makes it all worthwhile. Whether it’s investing in a print subscription for yourself, giving somebody a gift subscription, ordering bulk copies to leave in your workplace, doctors’ waiting room or a local cafe, you are helping us change the news for good. Thank you! Now on to issue 91.

https://www.positive.news/society/leaving-hate-behind-global-movement-former-neo-nazis-helping-others-renounce-extremism/,refugee,673,"June 30, 2017",Lucy Purdy,"
A global movement of former neo-Nazis is helping others renounce extremism ","As surges of nationalism and incidents of hate crime are reported across the globe, a network of far right extremists who have renounced their views and resolved to help others, is growing too. Meet the ‘formers’
Many in far right movements across Europe and beyond believe their time is coming. Despite voters rejecting far right candidates in elections this year in France and the Netherlands, this type of extremism continues to bubble away below the political surface. June alone saw the attack on worshippers leaving London’s Finsbury Park mosque; police in Germany reporting a surge in hate crimes carried out by right wing extremists; and the success of a crowdfunding campaign that aims to block boats carrying refugees crossing the Mediterranean.
They might be a fractured mix of people with racist, misogynistic and antisemitic views, but extremist groups can be tempting to those who feel left behind by life and society.
Nigel Bromage is co-founder of Exit UK, an independent organisation that helps people leave far right extremism. He used to front a violent neo-Nazi organisation and so knows all too well the techniques that recruiters use. “I’ve worked with young people who are simply lost or from fractured homes and looking for love, understanding and compassion. Extremists manipulate these things to get people involved,” Bromage tells Positive News.
The Exit movement began in Norway in 1997, followed by organisations in Germany and Sweden. Now, there are at least eight groups worldwide, from the US to Germany, providing support for neo-Nazis who want to leave. And governments increasingly recognise the role that ‘formers’ have to play.

So how does it work? “It’s tailored to each client,” explains Robert Örell, director at Exit Sweden, “but it can be very practical: helping people get rid of tattoos, move house, get a job or to attend meetings with social authorities. We also offer emotional support in a non-judging environment. My background means I can understand these people, why they joined, and they trust people with similar experiences. I know it’s possible to change. I can help people make the same move.”
In the past 20 years, the Exit movement has become much better equipped. Frequent international meet-ups allow the sharing of the ‘science’ of deradicalisation: what is it that makes people vulnerable to the grip of extreme groups?

ExitUSA, which is run by an organisation called Life After Hate, sows the seeds of doubt in extremists’ minds. “We use social media to deliver our messages and videos to a very tight demographic, our ideal target audience, based on their Facebook likes, music and groups,” explains Tony McAleer, executive director of Life After Hate.
“A lot of it hinges on triggering disillusionment. People might say this ‘great’ stuff about life in the movement, but I know from experience that if you’re disconnected from your humanity, a lot of things in life aren’t going to be functioning. We use messaging such as ‘don’t get fooled like we were’.
“When people are in the honeymoon phase of being in these groups – because they are incredibly powerful – there might be nothing we can say to change their perspective. But that will change. I say to people: ‘When you realise how dysfunctional it is, you get tired and burned out, and your relationships suck, I will still be here. I’ll wait for you.’”

10 inspiring responses to Trump’s first 100 days ","The first 100 days of Donald Trump’s US presidency have been controversial to say the least. But his administration’s most anti-progressive policies have been met with a wall of creative responses, in the US and elsewhere
Action:
Trump’s “global gag” on abortions blocks US funds to any organisation involved in abortion advice and care overseas. It means that even projects working on, for example, Aids or malaria are forced to strip all mention of abortion from their programmes in order for their funding to continue. The ruling could affect as much as $600m (£494m) of aid and millions of girls and women around the world, say campaigners.
Response:
Despite being hastily arranged, representatives from 50 governments attended the She Decides conference in Brussels on 2 March. Among those helping devise ways of plugging the gap? Kenya, Vietnam, Nepal and Japan. Organisers hope to raise $600m (£494m) from international pledges. “This is not a conference against the American administration; this is a conference for something,” said Sweden’s deputy prime minister, Isabella Lövin.
Lövin, who is also minister for international development cooperation and climate, made headlines when she appeared to parody Trump and the all-male lineup in the Oval Office that signed the global gag order. She tweeted a picture of herself and female colleagues, as she signed Sweden’s climate law.

Action:
Trump’s sexist rhetoric in last year’s presidential election race brought women’s rights sharply to the fore. One commentator said the US leader “wears his disdain for women like a badge of honour”.
Response:
From London to Washington, women’s marches took place across the world to protest Donald Trump’s inauguration and advocate for women’s rights. Political scientists estimate that between 3.3 million and 4.6 million marchers took part across the US alone, describing it as the largest – and most peaceful – day of protest in the country’s history.
Civic groups promoting women’s rights have also seen a surge in support, with US reproductive healthcare provider Planned Parenthood netting 300,000 donations in the month and a half following Trump’s election – 40 times more than usual. They included 82,000 donations made by pro-choice advocates in the name of US vice-president Mike Pence, a longtime opponent of women’s reproductive rights.
Action:
On 27 January President Trump signed an executive order halting all refugee admissions and temporarily barring people from seven predominantly Muslim countries. It was described as the most significant hardening of immigration policy in generations, and condemned by many as being racist and anti-Islamic. It was revised on 6 March, narrowing the countries to six – Syria, Sudan, Yemen, Iran, Somalia and Libya – and allowing for case-by-case exceptions.
Response:
Thousands of lawyers worked pro-bono at airports to help travellers caught up in the chaos, and some courts across the US blocked the implementation of the ban. The US tech community united in the face of the travel ban too: more than 2,000 employees staged walkouts at eight Google campuses across the US, holding up signs including “Resist” and “No ban no wall” and tweeting them under the hashtag #GooglersUnite.
Artists also got in on the act: the Museum of Modern Art in New York replaced works by Picasso and Matisse with those by artists from countries affected by the ban, and a museum at Wellesley College, in Massachusetts, placed “shrouds” over artworks created or donated by immigrants.
Action:
Trump pledged to deport millions of undocumented immigrants, using an expanded Border Patrol — and perhaps also military troops — at an estimated cost of $5 trillion (£3.8 trillion) over 10 years. Trump also wants to strip federal funding from so-called sanctuary cities that refuse to hand undocumented residents over to federal authorities. His administration has launched a new government office to publicise crimes committed by immigrants. Immigrant advocates say the move does not align with actual crime data and appears designed to demonise immigrants.
Response:
Thousands took part in ‘day without immigrants’ protests in the US on 16 February. Some businesses closed for the day, children were kept away from schools and families with migrant roots purposefully spent no money during the day. Judges subsequently blocked a Trump order targeting sanctuary cities and, in a major U-turn, Trump announced that he had no plans to deport undocumented “dreamers,” who were brought to the US as children.

Action:
Trump seized the Republican presidential nomination by promising to build a physical wall along the Mexican border. “I will build a great great wall on our southern border and I’ll have Mexico pay for that wall,” he pledged.
Response:
Mexican officials rebuffed Trump’s plan, and countered it by proposing an entry fee for American visitors. In the US, polls found most border-state residents oppose the wall, and that just 16 per cent of people believed Mexicans would pay for it. Many of the US’s largest construction companies declined to bid on contracts to build the wall, and California lawmakers moved to blacklist companies that may get involved in its construction.
Action:
Despite claiming to support the rights of the LGBTQ community, Trump swiftly canceled an Obama rule that allowed transgender schoolchildren to use bathrooms that they felt best matched their gender identity. Next up, a leaked draft of President Trump’s ‘Religious Freedom’ order revealed plans to create sweeping exemptions from anti-discrimination laws for people and organisations who claim religious objections to same-sex marriage, premarital sex, abortion, and transgender identity.
Response:
People held a ‘kiss-in’ outside Trump Tower in New York City. As night fell, it turned into a dance party. “You need some joy in resistance, and I feel that getting out in the street and being with community refills your tank,” teacher and writer Liz Dalton told NBC News. LGBTQ supporters also got a boost when North Carolina lawmakers repealed a controversial ‘bathroom bill’ barring transgender people from using bathrooms matching their gender identity. The change came after a wave of grassroots activism, and a corporate boycott threatened to cost the state $3.6 billion (£2.8 billion).
Action:
President Trump pushed for a repeal of Obama’s flagship healthcare reforms, offering a replacement that would have left 52 million Americans without health insurance. Meanwhile, it was estimated that the repeal of the act would have meant $144 billion (£112 billion) in tax cuts to millionaires.
Response:
Thousands of voters, including many in Republican states, attended boisterous town hall meetings to urge their representatives to oppose Trump’s healthcare plan. US digital organising group MoveOn mobilised 100,000 people in February for its ‘resistance recess’ – a campaign to lobby Republican lawmakers during the congressional break.
Lacking support from both Democrats and Republicans, Republican leaders were ultimately forced to cancel a vote on the repeal bill. “Obamacare is the law of the land,” conceded house speaker Paul Ryan in the wake of the defeat.
Action:
Some believe that Trump’s heated rhetoric, and his hiring of Breitbart chairman Steve Bannon as his chief strategist, empowered the far right. Many anti-racism campaigners blame Trump as being partly responsible for a wave of hate crimes in recent months, including bomb threats targeting Jewish community centres.
Response:
Using a slogan created by a third-grade school pupil, a Chicago neighbourhood group launched the ‘Hate Has No Home Here’ campaign. Their striking multilingual posters went viral, and are now displayed in homes and businesses across the country. “As adults, we’ve become immune to the idea that there is bigotry, there is hatred, there is ugliness in the word. Children don’t get that,” Carmen Rodríguez, one of the campaign’s founders, told the Chicago Tribune.
Action:
Trump’s team rushed to dismantle Obama’s environmental protections, including key rules covering clean air and water, fuel efficiency, and power plant emissions. Trump also distanced himself from the Paris climate deal, approved the Keystone XL pipeline, barred federal scientists from communicating with the public, and moved to slash funding for federal scientific bodies.
Response:
Twitter accounts run by the National Park Service went ‘rogue’ and started posting messages about global warming. Numerous unofficial accounts sprang up to promote climate science. Corporations including General Electric and ExxonMobil pushed Trump to acknowledge the reality of climate change, and major players including China and the EU said they would keep championing global climate efforts. On Earth Day, the March for Science saw tens of thousands of people join protests in support of evidence-based policymaking. “It’s important to show this administration that we care about facts,” roboticist Chris Taylor told the Washington Post.
Action:
Trump is the first modern president to refuse to release his tax returns, has hired family members in senior roles, and has failed to sever his ties with his business empire. He has used weekends to tour Trump-branded resorts, and used the State Department to promote Mar-a-Lago, the Trump-owned club in Florida where initiation costs $200,000 (£155,183).
Response:
Congressional Republicans have arguably given Trump a free pass on his conflicts of interest, but protestors held Tax Day demonstrations demanding the president’s tax returns. Journalists are using freedom of information laws to track his business ties. In a closely watched case, two restaurant-owners in Washington DC are suing Trump under a clause in the constitution, arguing that his continued ownership of the Trump Hotel in the city — where foreign dignitaries now routinely stay — puts competitors at an unfair disadvantage. “This is about purchasing access, and that’s not fair,” said one of the restaurateurs’ lawyers.

100 comics artists sketch a guide to positive political action ","More than 100 comics artists and illustrators from around the world have launched Draw The Line, a visual guide to ‘positive political action that anyone can take’
In reaction to social, environmental and political changes in the US, Europe and across the world, the new Draw The Line project includes more than 100 comics. Each illustrates a different way in which people can help to change their community, politics and the world.
Draw The Line is the brainchild of comics artist and activist Myfanwy Tristram who assembled a cast of international talents, including award-winning artists Dave McKean (of Sandman and Coraline fame), Steven Appleby (Normal Life, Loomus) and Karrie Fransman (The House that Groaned).
“Like many people, I found the political upheavals of 2016 pretty scary, and I was looking for positive ways to push back” Tristram told Positive News.
When things are looking bleak, it can be hard for people to picture a better world. That’s where comics artists can come to the rescue
“When things are looking bleak, it can be hard for people to picture a better world. That’s where comics artists can come to the rescue, showing people how they can make that change happen.”
Taking inspiration and advice from social, political and environmental movements such as Black Lives Matter, the Women’s March and Standing Rock, Draw The Line features positive political acts, ranging from the traditional to the cutting-edge and the gentle to the radical. “But they all share a desire to change the world for the better”, says Tristram.
#1: Media shapes our world
We believe excessive negativity in the press is destructive for society, so we’re working to create a more constructive and compassionate media. To do this, we need your support
In one image, two women are pictured in a high street shop, not browsing the rails but furtively sewing labels into clothes. The labels read ‘made for you in a sweatshop far away’ and ‘made in degrading conditions’.
In another comic, a literal gorilla brightens up his beleaguered street with acts of guerilla gardening. A tabloid front cover proclaims: ‘Six out of ten migrants are secretly squirrels’ highlighting the need to question ‘fake news’ and check sources.
Drawings and words together give ideas greater power than either alone
Comics artist Karrie Fransman said: “Draw The Line is an uplifting demonstration of what 100 talented comic artists and activists can accomplish with blood, sweat, ink and a belief in justice and equality. We hope these actions will inspire thousands more.”
Cartoonist Steven Appleby added: “Drawings and words together give ideas greater power than either alone.”
The Positive News pick of Draw The Line comics for positive political action, and their captions
Grow Wild by Birta Thrastardottir
“We depend on bees for many of our fruits and vegetables, but since 1945 the UK has lost 97 per cent of its wildflower-rich meadows – which many species of bees depend on.
“Why not grow your own mini wildflower meadow or create a bee-friendly habitat for your community, school or workplace? If you have a space big enough, Friends of the Earth will provide kits and support to get you going and keep our world buzzing.”
Go Cross-country by Myfanwy Tristram
“Taking fewer flights can be a reward in itself, if you take time to enjoy the journey as well as the destination. Work in some extra time to go by train, boat, bus, bicycle or a combination of all the above — and let your employees do the same.”
Carry Water by Katriona Chapman
“Along the US/Mexico border, the Border Angels charity leaves jugs of water along desert migrant paths, to prevent dehydration — an all-too-common cause of death for migrants.”
Leave a Deposit by Kate Charlesworth
“Shop dropping is the opposite of shoplifting: instead of taking from a store, you leave something. Slip a note into a jacket pocket, pin a badge on to a lapel or leave a drawing between the pages of a book: a political message for a future shopper to find.”
Smile, Don’t Stare by Mirka Oinonen
“If you see someone who looks a little different for whatever reason, don’t stare. Just like anyone else, they have feelings too. The difference between them and you? This might be the first time you’ve been in this situation; for them, it’s a constant reality.”
Build a Wall of Kindness by Jaime Huxtable
“While Donald Trump was first talking about his divisive wall, the concept of a ‘wall of kindness’ was blossoming in Iran. Stretches of wall are painted and furnished with pegs. Then, people hang clothes, food and goods that they no longer need for the homeless or poor to take. The concept is spreading: several towns in the UK currently feature their very own walls of kindness (in the case of Brighton, it’s a seafront shelter of kindness).”
See People as People by Woodrow Phoenix
“Those at the charity Streets of London says that we must challenge the perception that homeless people are any different from the rest of us. Homelessness begins when something bad happens and you don’t have family or friends around to help. It could happen to any of us.
“The same logic can be applied across many sectors of society: they may be temporarily disadvantaged but they are people.”
Stop the Rot by Riyadh Rateme
“Ask your local restaurants to donate their leftover food to the homeless. Better still, see if there is a setup like the Real Junk Food Project which will collect waste food and turn it into meals for those who need it.”
Go Slow by Rica March
“Fast fashion — the phenomenon of cheap high street shops churning out clothes that are only designed to last a season, cost almost nothing and then end up in landfill — is bad for the environment.
“Ask yourself how much the factory workers must be getting paid to be able to offer garments at such low prices. Then research the more ethical options and take your custom there. Buy fewer items that are high quality and will last longer.”
Put Out a Welcome Mat by Karrie Fransman
“Let refugees know that they are welcome. Befriend them, give them a friendly smile, put a poster up in your window (or that of your workplace) and/or donate clothes and toys. You may even consider fostering or sharing your home with those who need a roof over their heads.”
Call Out by Apila Pepita Miettinen
“Sites like Human Rights Watch’s Call It Out, Everyday Sexism, Bye Felipe and For Exposure use the simple but effective strategy of collecting real-life instances of bad behaviour (in these cases, hate crimes, sexism and non-payment of artists) and publicising them to the world via a website and Twitter account.
“By sharing the incidents you witness, you’re contributing to a public database that holds the nation to account.”
Plant Radical Roots by Zara Slattery
“Start a community gardening project where everyone reaps what you sow together. You’re growing cheap, healthy food, and at the same time, creating friendships, getting fresh air and exercise, improving mental health and reducing the amount of fruit and veg that needs to travel halfway round the world.”
Eschew the New by Myfanwy Tristram
“Buy secondhand. You’ll be benefiting a charity if it’s from a thrift store, or helping out the seller if you buy direct. Either way, you’ll be circumventing big business and shrinking your carbon footprint.”
Follow the Money by Guin Thompson
“You work hard for your money, so the last thing you want is some dodgy corporation using it to fund something you’re opposed to.
“Banks can use your money to invest for their own profits, so find out if your bank is putting it into, say, the arms trade, fossil fuels or businesses that use slave labour. Then close that account and tell other people what you’ve done. And remember to tell your bank: ‘It’s not me, it’s you’.”
Be Someone’s Voice by Kate Moon
“There are those whose voice is easily drowned out: those with learning difficulties, the frail, the elderly, those who find language difficult. For them, it can be impossible to get their wishes and needs expressed to doctors, the judiciary, landlords and others who have some power over elements of their lives.
“Volunteer via local charities to advocate for people whose voice is not heard.”
Support a Family by Karen Rubins
“Could you help a family new to your country? In the UK, groups can become community sponsors. They will be allocated a family fleeing conflict, and it will be their responsibility to support the resettled family from the moment of arrival in the UK.
“Other countries have similar schemes – check your local council or national government website for details.”

https://www.positive.news/perspective/water-divides-us-unites-us/,refugee,985,"February 16, 2017",Maggie Black,"
How water divides us – and unites us ","Water is our planet’s most vital resource, and is under more pressure than ever. But while it can be a source of conflict, water shortage also has the power to spark innovation. Maggie Black, author of The State of the World’s Water, explains how
In today’s crowded world, there is much talk of ‘water wars’ – conflicts waged over dwindling supplies of a substance essential to all life on Earth: fresh water. Fanciful as it may seem, some observers blame the current hostilities in Syria and the exodus of refugees from the Middle East primarily on water shortage.
Turn the metaphor on its head, and what do you have? ‘Water peace’ – a much more important idea. There is also a new branch of international affairs engaged in its pursuit: ‘water diplomacy’. Politicians, ambassadors, even security analysts are learning how to examine underlying causes of enmity and bring water resource contestants to the negotiating table.
When not surrounded by a sea, a river makes a handy territorial boundary. Since time immemorial, waters have marked the divide between lands and peoples. But since those living on one bank of a river share its flow with those on the other, and the water-related behaviour of those living upstream affects those downstream, the equitable management of water has always forced river basin dwellers together.
Water is a great leveller, raining ‘equally upon the just and the unjust fellow’, as Shakespeare put it
On the local scale, water peace can be about the control of ‘nuisances’ – or pollution, as we call it today; or about fishing the same body of water, damming it or altering its course. Often it is about agreeing not to take more from a lake, stream or aquifer than a negotiated fair share. Water peace can also be about navigation – ‘you may land on my side if I can land on yours’ – and flood control: ‘don’t send massive volumes downstream at one time’. There are hundreds of reasons to co-operate over freshwater distribution. Water is a great leveller, raining ‘equally upon the just and the unjust fellow’, as Shakespeare put it.

At the international level, things can be tricky. Many states rely on major rivers flowing from outside their borders. Ten countries share the Nile, six the Mekong, five the Amazon. Those at the source may have huge power over those at the mouth. Pakistan is dependent on the Indus whose headwaters are in India, a country it hates. Although sabres are often rattled and accusations fly back and forth, India has never threatened to close the sluices, even when the two countries were at war.
Since 1948, some 295 international agreements have been signed over shared waters, and most are respected even at moments of political strain. Just now, though, the Middle East, the most water-short region in the world, could do with some extra ‘water diplomacy’.
Since 1948, some 295 international agreements have been signed over shared waters, and most are respected even at moments of political strain
In the face of population and other pressures on our finite global water pot, the need for freshwater collaboration is growing. People in the UK get through more than 150 litres of expensively treated water each day, including washing machines, toilet flushing, kitchen consumption and showering. In an African village, where water is carried home from the well by women and children, 15 litres is more typical. But everyone wants a cleaner, healthier and more comfortable standard of life.
In fact, a high-water-consumption lifestyle, with a diet that includes meat, the most water-intensive of any food product (one kilo of beef requires 15,000 litres), and uses cars and other items requiring water-guzzling industrial production, is a world-wide aspiration. Since water cannot be manufactured, and underground fossil aquifers are gradually depleting, the only solution is better management of existing rain-fed supplies.
Of course, technological innovation helps. The costs of seawater desalination, which used to be prohibitive, are gradually dropping: Spain, for example, has 900 desalination plants. But the key technological advances are those that make managing water more efficient: ‘intelligent irrigation’ to increase crop yields per drop, frugal use of water in minimum-flush toilets, and the reuse of dirty water by treatment systems that do not cost, or pollute, the earth.
Just as climate change is prompting the growth of sustainable energy industries, water shortage is spawning imaginative new approaches
Just as climate change is prompting the growth of sustainable energy industries, water shortage is spawning imaginative new approaches – especially for agriculture which consumes 70 per cent of the world’s water. New plant varieties taste just as good as familiar vegetables, needing less water to flourish. Ancient methods of water harvesting and conservation are being rediscovered. In India, for example, small check dams across stream beds recharge aquifers and enable dry rivers to flow again. And earthenware filter pots with special membranes remove damaging chemicals such as arsenic from drinking supplies.
The sound management of water is the ultimate litmus test of humanity’s willingness to share our global endowment of natural resources – and thereby live in peace. So far, the omens are positive. With every war-like threat comes a recognition that there is no future on earth without co-operation over water. The urge for ‘water peace’ can enable us to overcome baser instincts and opt for harmony instead.

Redrawing the line: comics’ new superheroes ","Increasingly accepted as a valuable art form, comics are going where other media fear to tread in capturing our rich and diverse world
No longer just white men in tights battling supervillains, comics have moved on. From an American Muslim girl with shapeshifting powers, to a character based on a real-life single mother in embattled Syria, today’s comics are more diverse than ever. Dive into their vibrant pages and you’ll encounter issues such as mental health, human trafficking and climate change.
Saying ‘boom!’ and ‘pow!’ to stuffier, less nimble forms of expression, comic artists and writers are delving undaunted into social taboos and playing with diverse and positive ways to present marginalised characters. And perhaps most exciting of all is that, in so doing, they are both driving and reflecting new social archetypes.
Comics are delving undaunted into social taboos, playing with diverse ways to present marginalised characters
An explosion of experimentation is taking place. “It’s a very genuine, instinctive development and not a box-ticking, trend-following move,” says Julie Tait, director of the Lakes International Comic Art Festival, held in Cumbria each year since 2013.
“Comic creators, I find, have extraordinary integrity. They are also some of the most prolific and focused creators I have ever met. From re-interpretations of classic superhero characters to extraordinary new stories about people on the margins of society, the power of visuals combined with text is dynamite and it reaches people of all ages.”

Wearing a red, blue and gold outfit inspired by the shalwar kameez – a traditional outfit in the Indian subcontinent – the latest Ms Marvel character is Pakistani American teenager Kamala Khan, the daughter of immigrants. Making history when she became the first Muslim character in the Marvel universe to get her own series, Khan grapples with familial expectations, religious duties and her sense of identity. She is likeable, yet troubled – sometimes encountering misogyny and racism. The 16-year-old is a convincingly-drawn character in her own right. No token diversity here.

DC Comics has an HIV-positive superheroine in bow-wielding vigilante Mia Dearden, while Midnighter and Apollo is DC Comic’s new solo series about its first gay superhero power couple. Shortly before a spotlight was shone on indigenous water protectors at Standing Rock, Marvel unveiled Red Wolf: its first Native American superhero. Korean-American teenage genius Amadeus Cho recently took over as the new human alter-ego of The Hulk – he of muscular, green fame – while 15-year-old African American engineering expert Riri Williams was announced as the new lead in the Iron Man series.
This is a time where Transformers robots are in same-sex partnerships, Wonder Woman is declared an, (albeit controversial,) UN gender ambassador, Marvel’s Spider-Woman appears on a cover while heavily pregnant, and the character of Thor is now a woman – a breast cancer survivor to be precise.

Political punch
“It’s certainly exciting times and it’s great to see the variety of heroes out there,” says the UK’s new comics laureate, the Walking Dead artist Charlie Adlard.

“When comparing the process of making comics to films, for example, relatively speaking it isn’t a major risk. You’re not spending millions of dollars each time so you don’t ‘need’ to have a white, male protagonist because that’s what is guaranteed to sell worldwide. Comics are produced by basically one or two people, so artists and writers can get their ideas across much better – their singular vision, as it were.”
There is a rich tradition of political experimentation in comics, notes Tait, who believes comics are by their nature, often politically motivated. “Be it satire, empathetic character exploration or the battle between good and evil, whatever we mean by that,” she says.
“Most comic creators work in a fairly isolated way, from dawn to dusk in a studio, producing quality and quantity of artwork rarely seen elsewhere. Yet they’re connected globally most of the time and therefore international issues and ideas are at the forefront of their minds. I think they really feel injustice and want to counter it, often through their work.”
Despite the genre’s underground reputation, comics can be sharply relevant. In 2015, images of Kamala Khan began appearing over anti-Islamic advertisements on buses in San Francisco. Street artists had covered the ads with images of Khan alongside messages such as ‘Calling all bigotry busters’ and ‘Islamophobia hurts us all’.

First published in 1982, the series V for Vendetta charts a masked vigilante’s attempt to bring down a fascist British government – and its complicit media. Demonstrators in the Anonymous and Occupy movements wore masks based on the book’s central character. V for Vendetta’s writer Alan Moore has expressed pride over their adoption of the symbol.
“Moore thinks it’s pretty cool that his character offered inspiration and identity to protesters,” says Dominic Davies, a research fellow at the University of Oxford who researches and writes about comics.
And what about comics journalism? Visual narrative storytelling has been around for thousands of years, but the use of comics by publishers and other organisations to cover real-life events is reportedly at an all-time peak. Quotes are written in word balloons and sources and case studies become characters.
Comics have the ability to take the reader inside the emotions of people’s experiences and in a very ethical and sensitive way
US comics artist Nick Sousanis, who wrote his university dissertation entirely in comic book format, penned a nine-page comic for prestigious scientific journal, Nature. The Fragile Framework traced the last 25 years of climate negotiations and was published just as the UN climate conference in Paris was set to begin. It wasn’t the first time that climate concerns have made it into comic form. Iron Man is an advocate of clean energy, while the Captain Planet series has long advocated environmentalism. A new film about the green-haired eco champion whose only weakness is pollution will be produced by Leonardo DiCaprio – who is also known to have a soft spot for environmental activism.
“Comics have always used pictures to talk about world events, but there is definitely a shift towards this more recently,” notes Davies. “We live in an age where we use pictures to get information across very quickly; every Facebook feed is a little bit like reading a comic. The way we process information now is very often short bursts of texts with images. I think that goes some way to explain the popularity of comics today.”

Marvel’s Madaya Mom series tells the true story of a mother-of-five, trapped with her family inside the Syrian town of Madaya for more than a year. It captures the eerie silence on the streets, punctuated by cries from starving children left alone, alongside people carrying out acts of heroism amid the devastation.

A photojournalist by trade, Benjamin Dix was working as a communications manager in northern Sri Lanka during the civil war when he read Maus by Art Spiegelman and Palestine by Joe Sacco; graphic novels dealing with the Holocaust and conflict around the Gaza Strip respectively. On his return to the UK, he set up non-profit company PositiveNegatives and since 2012, has been producing comics about contemporary social and human rights issues including conflict, migration and asylum. The work often fuses personal testimonies with art – as well as advocacy and education materials. Subjects tackled in their 30 works so far include a Nigerian woman who was trafficked to the UK, drug addicts in West Africa and the abuse of domestic workers in Saudi Arabia.
“Comics have the ability to take the reader inside the emotions of people’s experiences and in a very ethical and sensitive way,” says Dix. “It’s much easier to empathise with a central character of a comic than to understand the experiences of 20,000 refugees in a news article for example.

“The ability to jump between time and space in a comic is unique to the medium, and can give context and explore the depth of the story being told. The ability to anonymise a character for security reasons is a fantastic and powerful tool that I use in almost every comic we produce. Issues such as trafficking, sexual violence, asylum and torture are such sensitive topics, so to be able to tell a first-person account without compromising the person’s security is a great strength of this medium.”
One of Dix’s most recent projects was to follow the story of a refugee from Syria to Europe, across the Mediterranean Sea and via multiple European refugee camps, “a fascinating and harrowing journey”. In comic form, he says, the audience can really ‘see’ what it was like, allowing access to places photos and film are unable to go: inside detention centres or a visual representation of post-traumatic flashbacks.
It’s much easier to empathise with a central character of a comic than to understand the experiences of 20,000 refugees in a news article
“A friend once told me that reading a book is a ‘sit back’ experience, whereas reading a comic is a ‘sit forward’ experience. One has to work with the comic to allow the brain to register the visual and narrative as a whole. The reader’s imagination has to engage between the panels so it’s a much more active viewing experience than watching a film or reading a book.”

In our post-Brexit vote society, Dix says, an easy outlet for fear is to blame people who we don’t understand and cannot easily identify with. “Our comics, based on real-life testimony, can help bridge this gap and help reduce intolerance and exclusion.”
Covering subjects such as human trafficking, racism, memory, identity, conflict and sexual violence can help build empathy and understanding with vulnerable groups such as refugees, says Dix. The drafts currently lining his desk describe persecution faced by the intersex community as well as exploitation of European Roma people.
“Building empathy is now more important than ever. It’s easier to be scared of people than to understand them. The easiest way to build compassion and empathy with these sorts of groups is to show them as human beings, with their own fears, pasts, hopes and perspectives in life. Simply show them as they are. Tell their story.”

UK comics laureate: ‘it’s great to see the variety of heroes out there’ ","The Walking Dead artist Charlie Adlard is the UK’s new comics laureate. He tells Positive News why comics are not just for kids and how the genre offers a thrilling creative freedom
How do comics allow freedom of expression that other media forms perhaps do not?
We’ve always been a fairly niche industry, especially if we’re talking about the UK or US market. Being regarded as a bit underground, the comics world tends to attract more adventurous people to write and draw. Back in the 1960s actual underground comics, as they were termed, were the craziest, most adventurous, surreal, psychedelic, experimental comics you could possibly get. I think that has held over since. Being slightly regarded as a lower art form means we feel we can get away with a lot more.
Plus, comics generally only have a couple of people working on them: a writer and an artist. They are very much the vision of one or two people. The creative direction can be really strong and exciting because of that.

What is unique about comics’ ability to convey information in a powerful, accessible way?
Comics are essentially just another way of telling a story but are probably a lot less threatening to some people. I think this is perhaps more true for comics than novels or plays, particularly to those who might have difficulty reading. It comes from a personal place for me because my eldest son is fairly badly dyslexic. He’s 15 now and the only things he’s read willingly without us forcing him or recommending them are comic books.
There are plenty comics out there that I would argue are just as relevant and important in literature as any other great contemporary novel. On the beginnings of someone’s ‘reading journey’, comics are great doorways into other forms of storytelling.
Comics are great doorways into other forms of storytelling
Many of today’s comics pick up on current affairs in exciting ways, covering subjects such as migration and climate change. Is this new, or has it always been the case?
I don’t think it’s too different to how it was 20 or 40 years ago. There is a rebellious streak to comics, probably because of the lack of respect we’ve been given over the years! I think comics also attract the kinds of writer likely to be interested in issues such as social justice. Of course, there’s the more commercial side and the more introverted, interesting, political side that’s a really valid and important part of the industry. I’ve noticed new issues such as migration and refugees being covered but I think comics have always followed the political landscape. Perhaps people are sitting up and taking more notice of comics now. But it’s always been there.
Is there now more of an acceptance of comics as a legitimate art form?
My view of comics is that it’s an inclusive genre. It’s not just for kids or adults – it’s for everybody. Lots of people are keen to talk about improving children’s literacy with comics. That’s brilliant, let’s do that. But let’s not keep it exclusive to children’s literacy. Let’s not pigeonhole comics as being just for kids.
We need to get away from this mindset, particularly in the UK and the US. The thinking in Japan and in mainland Europe is very different. In France and Belgium, comics are regarded as the ‘ninth art’, along with painting and sculpture. They are very well regarded. We have a bit of an uphill struggle in the UK to convince our society that it’s a worthy cause. We might not, within a generation, convince the general public that comics are the ninth art, but we can convince the majority that there’s more out there than what they assume, The Dandy and Beano.
In France and Belgium, comics are regarded as the ‘ninth art’, along with painting and sculpture
What do you love about being a comics artist?
The fact I can get up what I do every morning and enjoy what I do – all day! I’ve been drawing comics since I was six or seven. I just picked up on it and never gave it up and comics were also how I did the majority of my reading. In education back then, it was considered incredibly important to read the ‘classics’. But now the thinking is that it’s just important to get kids reading, as simple as that: books, magazines, comics, anything. As long as they’re reading words. It’s a different generation, when I was a kid, no one computers, devices, mobile phones. Now the world’s changed so much. It’s great to put comics back in the mix today and saying, ‘hey – it doesn’t matter. Look – they’re reading something.’
What sorts of characters or archetypes are emerging now? There is a Native American superhero for example, and a Muslim female superhero. Is that exciting?
Even in mainstream comics, there has been always a theme of getting away from the obvious hero. Think about when Stan Lee created Spider-Man in 1962 for example. Even though Peter Parker [the high school teen behind Spider-Man’s true identity] was a white, lower-middle-class kid, he was kind of a loser, a science geek: not your obvious Hollywood hunk by any stretch of the imagination.
Marvel created Luke Cage back in the 70s, partly off the back of the ‘blacksploitation’ movies of the early part of that decade. This was an interesting popular medium creating a black character. I’ve noticed there are nearly as many female protagonists as there are male characters in comic books but that doesn’t translate into films which probably feature male protagonists 70 per cent of the time. Within the more independent comics, there’s much more experimentation. It’s certainly exciting times and it’s great to see the variety of heroes that are out there.

Victory at Standing Rock – an ‘inevitable’ force halted in its tracks ","The US Army Corps of Engineers announced at the weekend that it would not grant a permit for the Dakota Access pipeline to drill under the Missouri river, a victory for Native American people and for peaceful protest
This weekend saw a long-awaited victory for Standing Rock and those protesting in solidarity against the Dakota Access pipeline. The US Army Corps of Engineers announced that it would not authorise the final section of the pipeline in order to allow alternative routes to be considered. The decision has been greeted as a win for North Dakota’s Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and, more widely, a nod to the power of non-violent protest.
Two years ago, news of plans for the pipeline reached those at the Standing Rock reserve. The tribe resisted the proposals: the pipeline would cross near sacred territory, carrying an average of 500,000 barrels of oil each day beneath the reserve. They also feared it could contaminate their drinking water.
But the pipeline seemed an unstoppable force, driven by the Dakota Access Pipeline company and backed by Energy Transfer Partners (ETP), international banks and other rich stakeholders. As the months went by, the Sioux were joined by members of other indigenous tribes and increasingly by protesters from around the world. Among the dozens of other Native American tribes to offer support, some had previously been estranged from or enemies of the Sioux for several generations.
Their campaign was decisively nonviolent. Before the announcement was made, this weekend, thousands of US veterans stood in solidarity at Standing Rock, acting as human shields between protesters and police.
Jo-Ellen Darcy, the army’s assistant secretary for civil works, said she had based her decision not to grant the permit on a need to explore alternate routes for the pipeline crossing. “Although we have had continuing discussion and exchanges of new information with the Standing Rock Sioux and Dakota Access, it’s clear that there’s more work to do,” Darcy said in a statement. “The best way to complete that work responsibly and expeditiously is to explore alternate routes for the pipeline crossing.”
The news has been greeted with cautious celebration. “We don’t often get these victories without bloodshed,” Richard Gonzalez, an indigenous veteran, told Mic News. “We demonstrated to the world that yes, there is a way.”
Mark Trahant, a journalist who regularly covers Native American matters, described it as a “bright moment in what has been a dark year for civil rights movements and people of colour across the world”.
This is a bright moment in what has been a dark year for civil rights movements and people of colour across the world
“Isolationist movements like Brexit, the election of Donald Trump, and the resurgence of white nationalism in the US have put the sovereignty and safety of refugees and indigenous people around the world in jeopardy. The Standing Rock resistance, for many progressives, represents a tangible victory at a time when protest has seemed ineffective.”
But the victory has been accompanied by a note of caution. Concerns have been raised that the decision could also be appealed and reversed. With such weighty commercial interests at stake, the possibility of the pipeline being defeated for good seems slight, some say. And it is just one of many similar battles taking place around the world.
“Writ large, the situation at Standing Rock is the situation of our whole planet: everywhere,” wrote US author Charles Eisenstein. “Dominating forces seek to exploit what remains of the treasures of earth and sea. They cannot be defeated by force. We must instead invite a change of heart by being in a place of heartfulness ourselves – of courage, empathy, and compassion.
“If the Water Protectors at Standing Rock can stay strong in that invitation, they will demonstrate an unstoppable power and win a miraculous victory, inspiring the rest of us to follow their example.”

Why now is the time for serious optimism ","Recent political events have shown that the ‘doom and gloom’ news narrative no longer serves society. A more inspiring lens on the world is needed in order to heal division and empower people to bring about change
Following the Brexit vote and Trump’s surprise election, questions have been asked about the media’s role in creating social division. Last month, Oxford Dictionaries named ‘post-truth’ the word of the year, describing circumstances when objective facts are less influential than appeals to emotion and beliefs. Our social media feeds have become echo chambers, critics say, and ‘fake’ news is proliferating. And only 25 per cent of people trust journalists to tell the truth.
Meanwhile, Stop Funding Hate has emerged, urging advertisers to withdraw from tabloids that the campaign claims fuel hate through aggressive anti-migrant stories.
But zoom out, and there is a wider issue about how the media has been influencing society.
For a long time, the press has been telling a negative story about human nature and what is happening in our world. The broad narrative that arises is that things are bad and getting worse; that we live in an acutely dangerous world characterised by self-interest, competition and scarcity.
Become a Positive News supporter and join the community that is changing the news for good
Recent decades, however, have in fact brought much progress globally and by many measures. They include a reduction of extreme poverty; fewer people dying as a result of conflicts; improving health and life expectancy; more countries having become democracies, and falls in violent crime.
Nevertheless, the benefits have not been equally shared. And it goes without saying that problems faced by individuals, communities, nations and the world as a whole – from climate change to social inequality – need our urgent attention.
But, despite the brilliance of so much journalism, the media’s excessive focus on bad news has created a story about our world that distorts reality, divides us and – counterproductively – limits our ability to respond effectively to the challenges we face.
There’s an urgent need, and opportunity, for a better story about ourselves, our world, and what’s possible
Where the media puts its attention and how it frames the information it selects, is a precious choice. It wields a powerful influence over our individual and collective mind states and it guides our shared cultural story. There’s an urgent need, and opportunity, for a better story about ourselves, our world, and what’s possible.
Why? Not to put our heads in the sand, but in order to shift the foundations of our society.
There are now decades of evidence about how negative news can lead to anxiety, depression, an exacerbated fear of others, helplessness, a decrease in pro-social behaviour and potentially to contempt and resentment for others.
In a newly published study on a sample of Positive News’ journalists and readers, conducted for a positive psychology master’s thesis, respondents said that an excess of negative news led them to see the negative in other people and feel isolated. But after reading Positive News they said the articles helped give them a wider perspective; increased their sense of community and belief that they could contribute to society and make a difference; helped them feel they could engage with problems; and improved their mood and made them feel optimistic.
This small study on our audience echoes findings across a new but rapidly expanding body of research into the impact of more positive media.
Constructive journalism – rigorous reporting about progress and possibilities for change – is now growing worldwide, with the BBC just one of the recent mainstream media organisations to trial it within its programming. This follows the likes of the Guardian and other outlets that have launched sections for constructive stories. Meanwhile, having instigated this approach more than two decades ago as the first publication to take good news seriously, we have seen a surge in subscriptions to Positive News magazine since the US election.
Establishing a constructive and compassionate mindset in the media will create a more fertile space for a truly thriving society
Establishing a constructive and compassionate mindset in the media will create a more fertile space for a truly thriving society. It will achieve this not by prescribing how society should be, but by unleashing human potential instead of drowning it in a sea of anxiety and cynicism.
We can present a new narrative of what it is to be alive at this time, based on an understanding that is in line with both ancient wisdom and the latest science. Beneath the destructive behaviours that arise from our wounds and fears, we are predominantly a cooperative, social species, with a universal need for connection.
Wherever altruistic human values underpin the ways in which we organise ourselves together to meet our needs, the new story emerges. From small acts of kindness to long, slow but profound advancements. Be it through remodelling education based on wellbeing; crowdfunding support for politicians that stand by values of tolerance; repurposing the economy to better serve the whole, through co-operatives and social enterprises; creating supportive communities through lending libraries, listening circles or socially-minded innovations such as apps designed to help refugees. The story reaches beyond a focus on political and commercial leaders and institutions, into other – perhaps more subtle – avenues of power and meaning.
There is a public interest in the media getting serious about optimistic stories, asking the question: how can we thrive as a society and leave no one behind, and where can we uncover the seeds of this?
It is in a narrative that reveals what connects rather than divides us that will we find a blueprint for new systems and social agreements. With the media as one of our biggest storytellers, in these uncertain times, what happens next depends on the story we buy into.

More than just fun and games? Sport as a tool of empowerment ","From downtown New York to remote corners of India, sport is being used to break social barriers and address issues from homelessness to addiction
In July, the Homeless World Cup saw more than 500 footballers – men and women from 52 countries – compete in the centre of Glasgow. In October, the annual Beyond Sport Summit brought together more than 1,000 people from the worlds of sport, business and government
to discuss how sport can trigger positive change.
The United Nations even recognises sport as a relatively low cost, high impact tool in humanitarian, development and peace-building efforts. UN special adviser Wilfried Lemke says: “Sport builds bridges between individuals and across communities, providing a fertile ground for sowing the seeds of development and peace.”
We explore four projects that demonstrate how sport can be much more than just a game.
Figure skating
Harlem, US
The Harlem team at the 2015 Terry Conners Synchronized Skating Competition
When competitive figure skater Sharon Cohen started working with girls in Harlem 20 years ago, she never dreamed she would eventually have 60 staff at her not-for-profit organisation in New York and Detroit. Together, they train and mentor 275 girls between the ages of six and 18 each week. When the girls take part in competitions, they are often the only non-white team there.
“Skating was a country club sport for most of its existence,” reflects Cohen. “You had to become a member to skate. We’ve brought it to communities that don’t have access to the sport.”
Cohen believes the sport’s novelty, grace and toughness help shape its appeal for the girls, most of whom have never set foot on ice before. “Figure skating is a sport and an art. There is a great deal of creativity involved, as well as athleticism. It is also difficult, not like picking up a baseball. You can’t learn skating quickly; you have to work at it. It’s about perseverance and overcoming hurdles. Our girls really like that challenge.”
It’s about perseverance and overcoming hurdles. Our girls really like that challenge
Figure Skating in Harlem combines two or three weekly sessions on the ice with an afterschool programme that covers academic subjects as well as leadership and life skills. Places are worth thousands of dollars each year but are offered to the girls for free. There is one requirement: they must keep their grades up. The approach seems to work. A third of the students achieve straight As and 80 per cent maintain a B+ grade or higher.
“I think that is is because our students learn how to dedicate themselves to something and to be disciplined,” says Cohen. “At a recent reunion one of our alumni told me: ‘What I learned most was how to fall fearlessly.’ I think that is a wonderful lesson in life: don’t be afraid to take risks.”
Street soccer
Scotland

“The impact is absolutely huge. Life-changing. If I hadn’t found the Street Soccer Scotland programme, I would probably be dead, another suicide statistic.” Robert Hare, 46, first made contact with the organisation at a drop-in session for people experiencing homelessness or social exclusion.
Through contact with prison services, rehabilitation centres, homeless shelters and mental health institutions, Street Soccer Scotland offers free training throughout the country. Anyone – men and women – can join in the weekly sessions, regardless of background, age or fitness level. Current players are aged between 16 and 60.
Five years after being on the winning Scottish side for the 2011 Homeless World Cup in Paris, Hare now works as programme co-ordinator for the social enterprise. At this summer’s tournament in his home city of Glasgow, he coached a team of refugees from Eritrea, Iran, Senegal and the Congo. They didn’t speak each other’s language but they found a common one in ‘the beautiful game’.
He saw a change in the players from the moment they became involved. “They bonded as a team. They still come to sessions and arrive first every time, asking to get started. They ask about our educational courses too; they’re so determined.”
He believes the sport holds the same appeal to all players, whether native Glaswegians or asylum seekers. “Street soccer offers somewhere to go to, release everything and get away from the dark place you’re in.”

An estimated 100,000 players are involved in grassroots street soccer programmes around the world. The Homeless World Cup sees teams from around the world, from Brazilian favelas to Norwegian suburbs, take part each year. The tournament makes use of football’s global popularity, team spirit and easy entry level to get things started. Once the ball starts rolling, personal development, healing, rehabilitation, and character and confidence building begin.
Waves for Change
Cape Town, South Africa
‘Surf therapy for violent communities’ is the tagline of Waves for Change, an organisation supporting young people from some of South Africa’s poorest and most dangerous townships. In Cape Town, where 45 per cent of children have witnessed a killing and 56 per cent have been victims of violence, the need is overwhelming. Waves for Change works with 250 children from volatile backgrounds, and seeing them undergo profound change is what keeps founder Tim Conibear going.
“We usually recruit kids who are attracted to really difficult activities,” he explains. “They tend to have higher levels of prejudice and reject authority more. “Surfing is a really good tool for attracting kids who head off on high-risk paths.”
Lessons encourage an appreciation of surfing’s reflective qualities, says Conibear. “Surfing is all about your journey through the ocean and how you engage with the waves. Taking part in an activity that is all about you makes you more aware of the benefits of different behaviours,” he explains.
Waves for Change works with children aged between 11-14 with the aim of building their self awareness. Conibear and his team help them build coping mechanisms, heal their ability to trust and support them in making positive life choices. “The kids who choose gangs are the ones who want to stand out,” he says. “We offer the same social structure that a gang might. The kids say surfing is cool and different and it elevates them above their peers.”
We offer the same social structure that a gang might. The kids say surfing is cool and different
The charity worked with the University of Cape Town to measure the project’s impact. Over the course of a year, those in the programme fought less and teachers and parents found they were better behaved and more engaged. “We’re mediating the kids’ ‘fight or flight’ responses. That leads to fighting less, choosing better friends and staying away from drugs.”
Skateistan
Afghanistan, Cambodia and South Africa
First ride – a young Skateistan skater in Phnom Penh
With more than half the population under the age of 24 and a quarter of all children engaged in child labour, Afghanistan’s social challenges are huge. In 2009, Unicef singled out the country as the ‘worst place’ to be born in the world. Girls face a particularly steep challenge: their lack of education means the female literacy rate is just 13 per cent.
Australian Oliver Percovich didn’t know any of this when he first rode his skateboard in Kabul in 2007. But he soon realised that the children he encountered working on the streets were curious in what he was doing. He let them have a go and quickly realised skateboarding’s potential as a ‘hook’ to get them interested in education too.
About half of the 1,000 youngsters in the Afghanistan programme are girls, which makes skateboarding the largest organised sport for girls in the country. The charity puts extra resources into the girls’ programme, funding transport and extra female instructors. Crucially, the newness of the sport there meant it was relatively free of gender stereotypes. Today, it is still considered inappropriate for girls to cycle, but riding a skateboard is generally accepted.
Percovich believes that skateboarding’s popularity could be attributed to its focus on individual battles. “In Afghanistan, people really like shows of strength. Fighting sports are very popular here, and skateboarding is sort of fighting with yourself. You overcome your fears to jump down ten stairs. With skateboarding, you’re up against yourself and what you think you can do.”
Skateistan has now expanded to Cambodia and South Africa and Percovich hopes the global connection will promote dialogue and understanding. “There is a community of skateboarders around the world who help each other. Young people need to understand that they are one and the same.”

Stop Funding Hate campaign urges firms to halt advertising in ‘inflammatory, divisive’ newspapers ","A campaign calling on advertisers to boycott newspapers that promote “demonisation and division” is also asking the public to lobby the advertisers in a positive, constructive way
As the dust settled on the Brexit vote earlier this year, experts at the University of Leicester warned that hate crime was being “fuelled and legitimised” by some of the UK media. This spurred the formation of Stop Funding Hate, a campaign group of people who met online who were horrified by the upsurge in hate crime following the vote.
Stop Funding Hate is asking big companies to drop advertising contracts with newspapers that campaigners believe promote hate and division. The group was plunged into the spotlight at the weekend when Danish toy manufacturer Lego announced it would no longer run promotional giveaways with the Daily Mail.
British parent Bob Jones had written to Lego, expressing concern over the company’s relationship with the newspaper, suggesting that the paper’s headlines “create distrust of foreigners” and “blame immigrants for everything”. The Independent newspaper reports that Lego confirmed the decision to be directly linked to Stop Funding Hate’s campaign.
Stop Funding Hate is now urging retailers including John Lewis, Waitrose and the Co-operative Group to follow Lego’s lead. Since August, the group’s launch video has been viewed more than 6m times and the group’s Facebook page has more than 185,000 ‘likes’.
So what is is resonating with so many people?
“The Daily Mail, Daily Express and the Sun have run demonising and dehumanising headlines for the whole of my adult life, but in recent years the problem has been intensifying,” Richard Wilson, Stop Funding Hate’s founder, tells Positive News.
“Last year the Daily Express ran nearly 50 front pages on migrants or refugees – almost all of them negative. This year isn’t yet over but the paper has already run more than 60 such front pages – more than one a week. And the Daily Mail is not far behind. At the same time we’ve seen a horrifying rise in hate incidents against a range of groups including Muslims and people from Eastern Europe.”
He says the response has exceeded all the group’s expectations. “It seems that our campaign has really tapped into a desire that many people have to push back against the culture of hate and everything that goes with it. Every day we get more offers of help and messages of support, which is hugely encouraging and inspiring.”

In October, the Council of Europe – an international organisation focused on promoting human rights, democracy and the rule of law in Europe – warned: “It is no coincidence that racist violence is on the rise in the UK at the same time as we see worrying examples of intolerance and hate speech in the newspapers, online and even among politicians”.
Does the media have a responsibility to consider what impact its coverage has? Wilson believes emphatically that it does. “The reality is that inflammatory, hateful headlines can have hateful consequences,” he explains.
“We get that editors have to sell papers, and boost their advertising revenue. And we can understand why. With sales in decline, some newspapers have taken to running these divisive, misleading and fearmongering headlines in order to try to retain their market share. But people are suffering as a consequence: people who feel personally targeted by this coverage, people who are experiencing racism and xenophobia as a result of the climate which these headlines help to create.
“I have friends who came to the UK as refugees and when I was a teenager my mum taught English to refugees in an adult education college. So I’ve been aware for some time of the mismatch between the media’s portrayal of this issue and the reality of people’s experience.”
And while many would agree that media has a responsibility in terms of the stories it publishes, what about the responsibility of advertisers?
“Traditionally, advertising placement has been seen as somehow outside the realm of corporate ethics and social responsibility,” agrees Wilson. “But we think it’s time for that to change. We would like to get to the point where the social impact of advertising becomes widely recognised as a corporate social responsibility issue. Our long-term objective is to shift the balance of incentives so that running these kinds of hate campaigns costs newspapers more money through lost advertising than it makes them in sales.”
Traditionally advertising placement has been seen as somehow outside the realm of corporate ethics and social responsibility, but we think it’s time for that to change
And Stop Funding Hate believes that the best way to challenge a culture of hate is by not participating in it. How has the campaign itself sought to reflect this?
“Early on we added a line to our Twitter profile saying ‘Don’t hate the media – change the media’,” says Wilson. “We’d noticed that when people criticised the Daily Mail, Sun and Daily Express, some were using the same kind of demonising language that we have sought to challenge elsewhere. We think it’s vital that we avoid further exacerbating the polarised and angry discourse that currently surrounds the issues we are trying to address.
“We are every bit as opposed to the hostility and hate speech that has been directed towards the media as we are against hate speech in other contexts. And we know that there are people within these newspapers who are also deeply conflicted about what is happening. So whenever we’ve asked people to send messages to advertisers urging them to pull out of the Express, Sun and Mail, we’ve also tried wherever possible to ask that people do it in a civil and respectful way.”
Wilson points to Bob Jones’s message to Lego as an example, demonstrating that it’s possible to carry out campaigns online in polite and friendly ways: “His message starts with the line ‘I love Lego’. And this, in among all the other messages, was the one that finally convinced an advertiser to make this move of ending their advertising in the Daily Mail. So it’s not only right – it also works. Most recently, we’ve also started tweeting under the #GoodwillToAll – and we’re open to suggestions about other ways we can keep encouraging a positive, constructive tone.”

Stop Funding Hate has now launched a new, ‘brandjamming’ video – a pastiche of Christmas advertising videos made by major retailers – urging firms not to advertise in newspapers that promote division or intolerance. John Lewis and Waitrose have said they do not “make editorial judgment on a particular newspaper” while the Co-operative Group says it is reviewing its advertising but has not yet made a decision.
Match of the Day presenter Gary Lineker has backed Stop Funding Hate and recently asked Walkers Crisps to reconsider advertising in the Sun over the newspaper’s anti-refugee stance.

Kate Brown
First elected openly LGBTQ governor
Kate Brown has been serving as Oregon’s governor since her successor resigned amid a corruption scandal in 2015. This week, she was elected by the state to serve the next two years of what would have been the rest of former governor John Kitzhaber’s term.
Brown – previously Oregon’s secretary of state and majority leader of the state Senate – is the first openly LGBTQ candidate to win a gubernatorial [related to a governor] election. She has been married to her husband since 1997, but was revealed to be bisexual years before that. She has since embraced her identity publicly, taking opportunities to speak about her sexuality.
“You can’t be what you can’t see,” she told the Washington Blade newspaper. “If I can be a role model for one young person that decides their life is worth living because there’s someone like them in the world, it’s worth it.”
Brown is also a survivor of domestic violence. She was vocal in criticising some of Donald Trump’s comments about women, which she said in the same interview were “re-traumatising” for her.
As governor, Brown has already invested into Oregon’s education budget and increased the minimum wage. Next, she hopes to introduce gun safety legislation – especially on campuses – increase high school graduation rates, and pass protections for LGBTQ people.

Tammy Duckworth
First Thai American woman elected to Senate
Many believe that Tammy Duckworth has been making history for years. Elected to the US House of Representatives in 2013, she became the first female veteran, the first disabled woman, and the first Asian American woman to represent Illinois.
Born in Bangkok to a second world war veteran father and a Thai mother, Duckworth grew up in various places throughout Asia, where her father worked for the UN and numerous corporations. She moved to Hawaii at age 16, where she also attended college, before earning her master’s in Washington, D.C.
She joined the Reserve Officers’ Training Corps in 1990 and later served as a helicopter pilot. In 2004, Duckworth was deployed to Iraq, and lost both her legs after her helicopter was hit by a rocket-propelled grenade. She has since advocated for veterans.
Each year, Duckworth and her former crewmates gather to celebrate their survival in the 2004 crash. “You can choose to spend the day of your injury in a dark room feeling sorry for yourself or you can choose to get together with the buddies who saved your life, and I choose the latter,” she told the Chicago Tribune.
In office, she has promised to fight for civil rights for LGBTQ people, protection of the Affordable Care Act, basic assistance for people facing poverty, and a reduction in gun violence.

Kamala Harris
First mixed race and Indian American woman elected to Senate
In 2010, Harris made history as the first female, first black, and first Asian American to be elected attorney general of California. Now, she will be the first Indian American and first biracial female senator.
Harris’ upbringing was a multicultural one. Born to an Indian mother and Jamaican father in California, she attended Howard University in Washington D.C. and received a law degree from the University of California.
Harris earned President Obama’s endorsement for the Senate, and was also speculated to be a potential replacement for US Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, though she has said she had no interest in filling the position.
In an interview with the New York Times Magazine, Harris discussed racial discrimination among prosecutors, saying: “They were talking about how these young people were dressed, what corner they were hanging out on, and the music they were listening to. I remember saying: ‘Hey, guys, you know what? Members of my family dress that way. I grew up with people who live on that corner.’”
Harris has committed to making higher education more accessible and expanding voting rights. She is also expected to work toward improving the criminal justice system.

Pramila Jayapal
First Indian American woman elected to the US House of Representatives
Soon representing Washington’s 7th congressional district, Pramila Jayapal is the first Indian American woman elected to US Congress. Born in India and raised in Indonesia and Singapore, she came to the United States at the age of 16 to attend Georgetown University in Washington D.C.
Jayapal has been involved in civil rights activism in and around Seattle for more than 20 years. She founded and served as executive director of pro-immigration advocacy group OneAmerica until 2012. In 2013, she was given the White House’s Champion of Change award.
She began her political career as a Democrat in 2014 when she ran for state Senate and won. After two years in state office, she decided to run for Congress and went on to a significant victory in the primary over her opponent, Democrat Brady Walkinshaw.
Jayapal’s progressive beliefs align with Bernie Sanders, who endorsed her in April. In a statement addressing the ‘one per cent’, Jayapal said: “What Congress needs is a progressive voice who is unafraid to take on these powerful interests.”

Catherine Cortez Masto
First Latina woman elected to Senate and first female senator from Nevada
Catherine Cortez Masto is both the first Latina woman and woman to enter the Senate from Nevada. The granddaughter of a Mexican immigrant, Cortez Masto was born and raised in the state.
Before being elected as Democratic senator, she served two terms as attorney general, during which she worked to provide financial aid for students and strengthen laws preventing sex trafficking.
“My grandfather came from Mexico for the very reason that many other families have come here, which is an opportunity to succeed, to make sure your kids have more than what you had,” she told news platform Mother Jones. “Because of his hard work and courage and the hard work of my parents, my sister and I are the first to graduate from college. That, to me, is the American Dream.”
As senator, she has said she will work to protect access to Medicare and Social Security, raise the minimum wage, and craft comprehensive immigration reform.

Ilhan Omar
First Somali American Muslim woman elected to state legislature
Ilhan Omar is the first Somali American woman to be elected to public office in the US. After fleeing the Somali civil war with her family aged eight in the early 1990s, Omar spent the next four years in a Kenyan refugee camp.
In 1995, Omar’s family arrived in Virginia and eventually resettled in Minneapolis, home to the nation’s largest population with Somali ancestry. She studied political science and international studies at North Dakota State University.
Omar has worked at the Minnesota Department of Education and as a senior policy aide for a Minneapolis senior council member. In August, she beat a 22-term incumbent by more than 10 per cent of the primary vote.
She has said she believes it is time leaders of her district truly represent the community’s diverse history, one that includes immigration. But her success hasn’t come from just popularity among Somalis.
“That ability to create connections with people who don’t look like me, who don’t share my identities, has sort of been the success of my campaign,” she told the digital media company Refinery29.
In office, Omar is expected to focus on closing the opportunity gap by supporting universal pre-kindergarten access, hiring more teachers of colour, and fighting for better rights for immigrants and LGBTQ people. She is also committed to making higher education more affordable and ensuring clean air and water.

Crowdfunders in Brighton help house homeless migrants ","A crowdfunded housing scheme in Brighton is one of several community efforts to support Britain’s newest arrivals
Over a year since the launch of a crowdfunded housing scheme to support migrants in Brighton, more than 200 people have set up standing orders of at least £1 a month. Brighton Migrant Solidarity (BMS) launched Thousand 4 £1000 in August 2015 to help house migrants unable to access other support. Organisers also held local fundraising events. The donations currently pledged cover rent and a £25 weekly income for three people. Once the £1,000 a month target is reached, the project will expand.
Ahmed*, originally from east Africa, is among the many migrants in housing limbo. After legally working at various times during the 16 years he has been in the UK, his visa has again expired. With no promise of a renewal, he is unable to work and ineligible for government housing support. He spent two years homeless in Brighton, but thanks to the ‘micro donations’ from Brighton residents, he has now moved into safe accommodation. “I laugh now, I didn’t laugh before,” he said. “I was starting to feel like everyone was bad.”
Jacob Berkson from BMS said the refugee crisis, which escalated in mid 2015, created a tipping point. “Suddenly there was money and people willing to put the effort in.”
Elsewhere, Cardiff’s ShareDYDD, Host Oxford and Room for Refugees offer similar schemes.

As the world watches Calais, how to build children’s resilience to trauma ","Professor of child mental health at the University of Leicester, Panos Vostanis, set up a global network to build resilience in some of the world’s most vulnerable children. He describes his current project, a tour of six continents in six weeks to support young people traumatised by poverty and conflict
In any society, about one in 10 children suffers from mental health problems. This rate can rise to 40 per cent or higher if children are traumatised by abuse or neglect, war, being raised in care, or homelessness. Child trauma often persists into later life and, despite growing awareness of the impact it can cause, stigma around mental health continues to hinder progress. Many countries do not have child mental health policies or services while others lack the legal framework for protecting children most in need.
We are getting closer to understanding how best to support the world’s most vulnerable children. The World Awareness for Children in Trauma programme was borne out of the belief that there is always hope. In a collaboration between schools, universities and NGOs in 12 countries, we are building awareness, growing networks and delivering training to help communities to help their children.
The goal of visiting six continents in six weeks is to make environments such as orphanages and refugee camps safer and more child-centred. We want to help caregivers develop more nurturing styles and boost children’s self-esteem through education, sports and art. We will also set up individual and group strategies for children and carers most affected by trauma.
We want to help develop more nurturing styles and boost children’s self-esteem through education, sports and art
In Nakuru, Kenya, we are working to get young victims of ethnic displacement, now living in extreme poverty, back to school. After losing her father to ethnic-related violence when she was young, 15-year-old Mercy grew up in the Nakuru slums, and lacked funds for school fees. We worked with the Friendly Action Network, a charity that supports families affected by conflict, and Mwariki Secondary School to secure a full scholarship for Mercy to attend school. In September, she told us how much she was enjoying it.
“I am learning a lot of inspiring life skills,” she told us. “I did well in my exams last term, and am working hard to achieve my dream of becoming a doctor. I want to save people’s lives.”
We also work with parents and teachers to create group support for those who suffer from post-traumatic stress, anxiety or depression, with the aim of encouraging the children to recognise and help manage each other’s symptoms.
Trauma-focused interventions help children understand how their experiences are linked with how they feel, think and behave, before looking at strategies to change them. We then use talking, play, writing and various creative activities, such as drawing and music, to help create new thinking and behaviour patterns.
Thanks to advances in research, we now have a better idea of the factors that place these children at risk, and how their parents’ mental health and capacity to care for them impacts on their wellbeing. There is less evidence on what protects children in the face of trauma, but our knowledge is growing, and our direct experiences have informed ways of helping in even the most difficult life circumstances.
Trauma-focused interventions help children understand how their experiences are linked with how they feel, think and behave
We now think about children’s resilience on several interlinked levels: individually, within their family, school and the community. This generally means that we can support children in at least one of these levels, even in the face of extreme adversity.
During this trip, we will support homeless young people in the US, disadvantaged indigenous children in Australia, refugee children in Greece, street and refugee children in Turkey, those in favelas in Brazil, and orphans in Pakistan and Indonesia. These places were selected to represent different groups of the most traumatised children globally, linking with charities and existing partnerships wherever possible.
Alongside seminars we will host hands-on arts and sports events, adapting the programmes depending on children’s circumstances. Ultimately, we aim to create guidelines for tackling mental health needs in a range of scenarios, including post-conflict situations.
If such guidelines were in place, the notorious reception centres and camps throughout Europe, such as in Calais, could be more child-centred and far less damaging. Staff could be trained in understanding and recognising children’s needs, and tailored programmes could ensure children had every chance of recovery.

After one year of making news beautiful, thank you to our community ","The Positive News team celebrates four editions in the new format as a quarterly magazine
On Thursday evening, 13 October, we gathered with Positive News co-owners and subscribers to celebrate one year in print as a magazine.
With the four issues we’ve created this year lining the walls of a room at the British Film Institute (BFI), and the air thick with conversation and celebration, we felt proud and grateful to you – our growing community – for helping us create and sustain a more inspiring and empowering kind of media.
More than a year ago now, 1,526 readers and journalists from 33 countries supported our ambition of making Positive News the first global media co-operative established by issuing ‘community shares’ through crowdfunding.
Last night, squeezing in to the Drawing Room of the BFI with some of our readers and co-owners, we launched the fourth issue of the new magazine. It was a chance to recognise how far we had come since our #OwnTheMedia crowdfunding campaign, and to celebrate the inspirational people who have filled our pages with their experiences and ideas.
Among the many articles published in the four magazine issues, we have explored the global happiness movement; discovered how domestic workers around the world are reclaiming their rights, and, most recently, met those working to preserve the world’s endangered languages. We have provided constructive angles on issues such as the future of democracy, multiculturalism in the UK, and how to tackle terrorism. And we’ve brought you diverse, inspiring news such as how small businesses are uniting for a fairer tax system; breakthroughs in efforts to prevent Alzheimer’s; and the community projects providing homes and help for refugees.
From rigorous quality journalism to our attention grabbing covers, our magazine makes news beautiful.
One subscriber who came along to the event, Priscilla Silcock, explained how a difficult time encouraged her to improve her media diet. “I joined Positive News because I know that changing the words and images I surround myself with would make a difference in my life. Traditional media was a source of anxiety, even despair, for me and I was craving a reliable source with a positive focus. I hope this is the beginning of a movement that can spread internationally to benefit as many people as possible.”
Another supporter, Jessica Smulders Cohen, rediscovered Positive News while studying for an MA in sustainable design, and has been “championing it ever since”.
“I began to think about how we needed to find a new way to inspire people. Scaremongering just doesn’t work. I am quite a positive person but I was getting down about the state of the world. I think people want to contribute to improving things and hear about what is going well.”
We’re proud of the magazine as a beautiful showcase of constructive journalism
Our editor-in-chief, Sean Dagan Wood, reflected on the milestone.
“We’ve undergone a big transformation in the past year,” he said, “and been really pleased with the response. We’re proud of the magazine as a beautiful showcase of constructive journalism. With our ownership structure as a community benefit society underpinning this, we have set strong foundations.
“But we’re just at the beginning of our journey as a media co-operative. We are still evolving our business model, and while continuing to focus on reaching more people with our journalism, we’re looking forward to now developing ways for our global community to get more involved.
“It was great last night to meet co-owners, subscribers and supporters, to celebrate, discover what our journalism means to them, and hear their ideas. There is much more still to come, and we’re incredibly grateful for our community’s passionate support.”
In April, we met with Michael Møller, director general at the United Nations Office at Geneva, along with the editors of some of the UK’s largest mainstream media organisations, to discuss the opportunity for a more solutions-focused approach in the media and to hear why the UN was endorsing this. Meanwhile, through our media training workshops, we have been introducing more students, journalists, editors and news organisations to the theories and practices of constructive journalism. Things are changing, and we see you – our co-owners and supporters – as pioneers in this bid to make the media more balanced and useful.
There remains much work to do and more than ever, we need your help in spreading the word about Positive News and encouraging people to subscribe.
One thing is for sure – to echo the strapline for our latest issue – there are many more stories to come about how #OurWorldIsBeautiful.

The teen who escaped child marriage by rapping about it ","Nineteen-year-old Sonita Alizadeh was just 10 and an Afghan refugee in Iran when her parents first tried to sell her into marriage. Now, through defiantly eloquent rap music, she protests against the practice of child brides
When has life really challenged you and how did you respond?
Life has always been challenging as an Afghan girl living in a war-torn country and then a refugee in poverty. My family fled to Iran when I was eight to escape the Taliban. I was denied a formal education but learned to read and write at an NGO for Afghan refugees. My family wanted to sell me into marriage to pay my brother’s dowry. I turned to the only activity that brought me comfort: I would write songs, lean my face into a microphone and rap.
When was your passion for women’s empowerment sparked?
One by one, I saw my friends disappear from the classroom. They left to get married, which meant having children while they were children themselves. Some were as young as 12 and getting married to much older men. It isn’t that the families hate their daughters, but they are trying to maintain the traditions of their elders and, sadly, they don’t know any better. My mother was a child bride and didn’t meet her husband until their wedding day.
Can rap change lives?
I think so. Rap, music, and poetry have been outlets for me to express myself to the world. They let me tell my story; to share the words in my heart. I would rap about my friends who came to school with bruises and broken spirits after begging their families not to sell them. My music changed my family’s mind. Now, I am somewhere that I never imagined I would be. Rap is powerful. People pay attention to the words. They listen. It can help change their minds and then, hopefully, their behaviour.
Rap is powerful. People pay attention to the words. It can help change their minds
What does a day in your life look like?
I live in Utah in a dorm at my school. A typical day for me is classes at school, doing my homework, hanging out with my friends, practicing my music and working on my campaigns. My days are full, but I like knowing that I am moving forward.
Where does your resilience and self-belief come from?
From having goals. Holding big ideas and believing in them has changed my life and keeps me on my feet. Otherwise we are travellers with no destination. Being determined gives me resilience and it empowers me to fight through challenges. I also believe that rough patches make us stronger and wiser.
What excites you about the future?
I have a beautiful image of this world in mind and I believe it can be created. My vision is a place where no child is forced to marry and everyone is able to go to school. My personal goal is to produce music for the world to enjoy and ultimately to be a catalyst for change.
How do you negotiate the differences between Afghanistan and the US?
Life in the US was very hard for me in the beginning. I wasn’t able to understand the language at all, but now it’s easier for me to connect with people. It’s been a year and a half since I came here and I’ve learned a lot about the culture.
My goal is to produce music for the world to enjoy and to be a catalyst for change
How can people tackle child marriage?
Educate themselves. Child marriage is not as simple as it seems. Poverty, tradition and lack of education all play a role. Find out where your country stands on the issue. Did you know that child marriage happens almost everywhere in the world?
How do young Afghans feel about the future?
Despite the everyday challenges they face, young Afghans are optimistic. During the Taliban regime, the sole purpose of a woman was reduced to serving her husband. It is better now. Although more than half of the already small percentage of girls attending school will have to leave their studies, we have girls like Malala and me who stand up. Every teenage girl out there is Sonita Alizadeh and Malala Yousafzai. Our efforts to promote and educate may not benefit us directly, but hopefully they will positively affect the future.

Despite referendum failure, Colombia can still reach peace ","Following four years of talks, a peace agreement was reached between government and Farc negotiators in Colombia and formally ratified in September. But, in a referendum on Sunday, Colombian people narrowly rejected the deal. Colombian researcher Felipe Roa-Clavijo, a doctoral candidate in international development at the University of Oxford, says progress has still been made
As a Colombian in the UK in the past few days, I have received more messages saying “sorry about the peace agreement” than I was sent well wishes on my birthday. The photos in the media of people crying and others enthusiastically celebrating the referendum result capture what the country is going through: sadness and laughter. Many can’t believe that after four years of negotiations, the peace agreement has been rejected. Others think that a better peace agreement can be reached. Beyond these emotions, it is important to understand that first, Colombian leaders from all parties have to rise up to the challenge of a new political puzzle in the long road to peace. Second, despite the frustrating outcome of the referendum, progress has been made in light of history.
The margin between the winning 50.2 per cent ‘no’ vote and the 49.7 per cent ‘yes’ vote was a difference of just 53,894 – the number of people, more or less, that would fit into a football stadium. A total of 13 million people voted in the referendum. But there were shocking differences in many areas of the country. For example, Bojayá is a small town on the pacific coast sadly known for having suffered the most civilian casualties as a result of conflict between guerrilla and paramilitary forces. [The massacre there in 2002 left 110 civilians dead]. The town voted 95 per cent in favour of the peace agreement. In contrast, in Medellin, the second largest city in Colombia, 62 per cent of people voted against the agreement. While the final outcome was close, there were significant regional differences. All in all, the country is divided in its support of this peace process.
The opportunity to approve or reject the agreement stirred some of the deepest feelings in Colombian people, to an extent that it has caused problems between groups of friends and families. Because I didn’t want to see more senseless cycles of violence, innocent people dying or refugees fleeing from the countryside to the cities, I voted to support the peace agreement. However, I also know family and friends who voted ‘no’. Many of them were not happy with the idea of guerrilla fighters receiving ‘soft’ transitional justice and alternative penalties. Others just could not forgive the great damage Farc has done to innocent people and the country as a whole, and couldn’t imagine its members in congress.
The post-referendum remarks by President Santos – who was awarded the Nobel peace prize on 7 October 2016 – and Farc leader Rodrigo Londoño were reassuring in that they ratified, at least at this stage, the continuation of the ceasefire agreement and efforts to seek peace. Former president Álvaro Uribe, leader of the ‘no’ campaign, claimed victory by inviting all parties to a national pact in which the conditions for peace of the no-voters would be heard.
Democracy is democracy. The no win means that the peace agreement’s 297 pages, negotiated over the past four years, are today completely ineffectual. None of the agreements in it can come to effect, and the president will not be able to begin its implementation.
What is needed now, ideally, is a three-party negotiation: government, Farc and the no-vote leaders as the new stakeholders at the table. It is therefore imperative that parties don’t walk away from the negotiation. Instead they must start redefining the negotiation terms as soon as possible to achieve a new peace agreement. Will they renegotiate the current agreement? Will they start a new negotiation from scratch? This questions are still open. Time is crucial and every minute counts.
Looking back
This shock must be also understood in light of history, looking back 30 years. The last time that Farc were stopped from going into politics was during the 1980s. This time, they also received a ‘no’, but through extreme violence. Thousands of them, already in politics, were killed by extreme right-wing paramilitaries and drug cartels. The state’s complicity in this was recently acknowledged.
As a result of the peace negotiation with President Belisario Betancur in the 1980s, Farc created the Patriotic Union, a political party that would represent their interests. Through a political participation agreement, they were allowed to run for public office and they gained positions including congress, state senators and municipal councils. Sadly, the following years were marked by bloodshed. More than 3,000 leaders of the Patriotic Union were assassinated, among them presidential candidates Bernardo Jaramillo and Jaime Pardo Leal. This unleashed new waves of violence in the country.
Some 30 years after this failed peace process, Farc’s breakthrough into politics has been stopped once more, but this time through votes, not bullets. While the outcome is frustrating for those of us who were supporting the peace agreement, the fact that it was reached not through extremist violence, but through democratic means, represents real progress.
The country currently sits on the verge of uncertainty, at a crossroads. Peace with Farc remains a priority for all the parties, yet this is not an easy path in the new political scenario. President Santos has announced that the ceasefire will be extended until 31 October while Farc leaders have instructed their troops to take safe positions. It is a scenario that opens up opportunities for consensus, but certainly one with high risks of relapsing into violent conflict.
Let’s not forget that the peace process with Farc following conflict in the 1980s came only 10 years later, with President Pastrana in 1999. For many reasons, this also failed. Whenever a peace process has been broken, it has been followed by waves of violence. People’s pledge to political leaders now is simple: let’s not let that happen again.

Beyond Brexit: localisation key to Britain’s future ","Local alternatives to global corporate control lead to stronger communities, economies and democracy, says Local Futures founder Helena Norberg-Hodge
The Brexiters are being blamed for pulling Britain in a racist, right-wing and economically unstable direction. But that is simplistic. Xenophobia is increasing in most countries inside the EU and out of it, and economic stability depends on more than EU membership. With Brexit unfolding whether we like it or not, we need to identify effective, everyday and local solutions that can provide Britain with a viable way forward.
To understand why people voted to leave, it is important to recognise how economic policies affect Britain’s culture and economy. One of the biggest influences is globalisation. My work in a wide range of countries has made clear to me how the global economy causes many of the problems we face. The same policies that generate wealth for the ‘one per cent’ are also responsible for fostering fear, racism and insecure livelihoods for everyone else, along with economic instability and environmental breakdown.
An outdated system
The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade was one of a number of institutions created following the second world war, designed to help restore financial order. At the time, promoting global trade was not unreasonably considered a way of integrating diverse national economies and interests. Many leaders believed this was the only way to avoid another global depression and world war.
But, like most idealised solutions, globalisation’s reality has diverged from the original plan. Through it, multinational corporations and banks have gained so much power that they are effectively able to hold nation states to ransom. The investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS) clauses, which give corporations the right to sue governments that do anything to impede not just actual profits but potential ones too, are just the latest manifestation of this.
Sadly, political leaders of both sides of the political fence are continuing to sign up to these agreements, hampering them, us and whole countries as they do so.
This leads to corporate control of employment, and the flow-on effect is that job security has been rendered obsolete for large sections of the population, including the middle class. This instability fosters personal insecurity, social fragmentation and, ultimately, the deepening intolerance, fundamentalism and violence we are witnessing worldwide.
Local alternatives
But viable, accessible alternatives to corporation-led globalisation are being developed at the grassroots, where the pain of trade and globalisation policies have been most deeply felt. While diverse and not immediately obviously linked, these alternative models have one key element in common: they favour localisation over globalisation.
One benefit of localisation is that it reverses the economic mantra of ‘comparative advantage’ – the idea that communities should specialise in just one or two products to export. By diversifying and localising our economic activities, we add strength and resilience to our ecologies and economies.
Localisation doesn’t, despite post-Brexit fears, mean pulling up the drawbridges and retreating into isolationism. Nor does it mean an end to trade. But it does mean a fundamental shift away from dependence – even for our basic needs – on a global market controlled by unaccountable corporations.
But the benefits of localisation go beyond economics and the environment. Among other things, localisation allows us to live more ethically as citizens and consumers. When the economy operates on a smaller scale, everything is necessarily more transparent. We can see if the apples from the neighbouring farm are being sprayed with pesticides; we can see if workers are being unfairly exploited.
The push for localisation is already underway. Millions of initiatives are springing up across the world, often in isolation one from another, but all sharing the same underlying philosophies. While they range from energy and housing to finance, the most important of these initiatives relate to food, the only product humans create that each one of us requires every day. Indeed, from farmers’ markets to community-supported agriculture (CSA), and from ‘edible schoolyards’ to permaculture, a local food movement is sweeping the planet.
Rethinking food
For example, the Real Food Store in Exeter, UK has forged strong relationships with nearby farmers and producers, creating a supply chain that reduces the distance between farm and table. Across the Atlantic, Pine Island Community Farm in Vermont, US supports refugees and migrants to farm and raise livestock in the traditional ways of their homelands. Meanwhile in Vancouver, Canada, Skipper Otto’s Community Supported Fishery is applying the CSA model to an unlikely contender: the seafood industry, promoting age-old fishing practices that ensure fair wages for its workers, while protecting the environment.
Because localisation initiatives such as these rely more on labour than on energy and technology, they foster local economies and help ensure greater job security; countering globalisation’s effects and supporting people’s physical and mental health.
Ultimately, in addition to shrinking our ecological footprints, localisation renews our connections to one another and to the world around us.

Opening the door to global equality ","Open borders would accelerate the global economy and lift millions out of poverty, argues Dutch author and historian Rutger Bregman
If you’ve been keeping up with the news lately, you couldn’t be blamed for thinking the world is in the throes of an immigration Armageddon. Europe is being inundated by hundreds of thousands of refugees. Donald Trump is calling to ban Muslims from entering the US, and all the while walls are going up right and left. In fact, three-quarters of all border walls and fences were erected after the year 2000. Here we are, 25 years after the fall of the Berlin Wall, and from Uzbekistan to Thailand, from Israel to Botswana, the world has more barriers than ever.
Why, you ask? The usual reasons: migrants and refugees will steal our jobs. Or, instead, they’re too lazy to work. Crime rates are higher among immigrants. Or, even worse, they’re all terrorists in disguise.
There’s just one problem with the usual arguments against migration. Stated simply, they’re wrong. In point of fact, there is no better recipe for making the world wealthier – a lot wealthier – than migration. Four different studies have shown that, depending on the level of movement in the global labor market, the estimated growth in “gross worldwide product” would be in the range of 67 per cent to 147 per cent. Effectively, open borders would make the whole world twice as rich.
In a world of insane inequality, migration is the most powerful tool for fighting poverty
This has led one New York University researcher to conclude that we’re currently leaving “trillion-dollar bills on the sidewalk.” An economist at the University of Wisconsin has calculated that open borders would boost the income of an average Angolan by about $10,000 (£7,580) a year, and of a Nigerian by $22,000 (£16,678) annually.
Even just cracking the door would help. If all the developed countries would let in just three per cent more immigrants, the world’s poor would have $305bn (£231bn) more to spend, says the World Bank. That’s the combined total of all development aid – times three.
The problem, in short, isn’t too much migration, but too little. In our era of “globalisation,” only three per cent of the world’s population lives outside their country of birth. The world is wide open for everything but people. Goods, services, and stocks crisscross the globe. Sure, we still have a few trade barriers, but if we scrapped them the global economy would grow only a few percentage points. According to the International Monetary Fund, lifting the remaining restrictions on capital would free up at most $65bn (£49bn). Pocket change, says Harvard economist Lant Pritchett. Opening borders to labor would boost wealth by much more – one thousand times more.
In numbers, that’s $65,000,000,000,000. In words, sixty-five trillion dollars (£49tn).
Economic growth isn’t a cure-all, of course, but in most countries, it’s still the main driver of progress. Opening up our borders, even just a little, is by far the most powerful weapon we have in the global fight against poverty. But sadly, it’s an idea that keeps getting beaten back by the same old faulty arguments.
1. They’re all criminals and terrorists
Not according to the statistics. As it happens, people making a new life in the US commit fewer offenses and less frequently end up in prison than the native population. Even as the number of illegal immigrants tripled between 1990 and 2013 to over 11 million, the crime rate reversed dramatically. According to FBI data, by as much as 48 per cent for violence (aggravated assault, robbery, rape, and murder) and 41 per cent for property crime (motor vehicle theft, larceny/robbery, and burglary).
What about terrorism? New research from the University of Warwick on migration flows between 145 countries over the period from 1970 to 2000 shows that far from being the cause of terrorism, immigration actually leads to a decline in terrorist acts. “When migrants move from one country to another they take new skills, knowledge and perspectives,” the lead researcher writes. “These stimulate technological innovation and diffusion of new ideas and this in turn stimulates economic growth. If we subscribe to the belief that economic development is linked to a decrease in extremism then we should expect an increase in migration to have a positive effect.”
2. They’ll take our jobs
We’ve all heard this one before. When a huge number of women suddenly entered the labor market in the 1970s, the papers were filled with predictions that the flood of cheaper working women would displace male breadwinners. There is a stubborn misconception that the job market is like a game of musical chairs. It’s not. Productive women, seniors, or immigrants won’t displace men, young adults, or hardworking citizens from their jobs. In fact, they create more employment opportunities. A bigger workforce means more consumption, more demand, more jobs. If we insist on comparing the job market to musical chairs, then it’s a version where new party animals keep showing up with more chairs.
3. Cheap immigrant labor will force our wages down
To disprove this fallacy, we can turn to a study by the Center for Immigration Studies – a think tank that opposes immigration – which found that immigration has virtually no effect on wages. Other research even shows that new arrivals lead to an uptick in the earnings of the domestic workforce. Hard-working immigrants boost productivity, which brings paycheck payoffs to everybody. All too often, moreover, the alternative to hiring immigrants is to outsource work to other countries. And that, ironically, does force wages down.
4. They’re too lazy to work
There’s no evidence that immigrants are more likely to apply for assistance than native citizens. Nor do countries with a strong social safety net attract a higher share of immigrants. In reality, if you correct for income and job status, immigrants actually take less advantage of public assistance. Overall, the net value of immigrants is almost wholly positive. In countries like Austria, Ireland, Spain, and England, they even bring in more tax revenue per capita than the native population.
5. They’ll never go back
This brings us to a fascinating paradox: open borders promote immigrants’ return. Take the border between Mexico and the US. In the 1960s, 70 million Mexicans crossed it, but in time, 85 per cent returned home. Since the 1980s, and especially since 9/11, the US side of the border has been heavily militarised, with a 2,000-mile long wall secured by cameras, sensors, drones, and 20,000 border patrol agents. Nowadays, only seven per cent of illegal Mexican immigrants ever go back.
“We annually spend billions of taxpayer dollars on border enforcement that is worse than useless – it is counterproductive,” observes a sociology professor at Princeton University. “Migrants quite rationally responded to the increased costs and risks by minimising the number of times they crossed the border.” Little wonder that the number of Mexicans who are in the US illegally grew to seven million by 2007 – seven times as many as in 1980.
Get a move on, get rich
Opening our borders is not something we can do overnight, of course – nor should we. Unchecked migration would certainly corrode social cohesion. But we do need to remember one thing: In a world of insane inequality, migration is the most powerful tool for fighting poverty.
How do we know? Experience. When life in 1850s Ireland and in 1880s Italy took a dramatic downturn, most poor farmers left; so did 100,000 Dutch people in 1830–1880. All of them set their sights across the ocean on the land where opportunity seemed unlimited. The richest country in the world, the United States, is a nation built on immigration.
Perhaps in a century or so we’ll look back on borders the way we look back on slavery and apartheid today. One thing is certain however: if we want to make the world a better place, there’s no getting around migration. As Joseph Carens, one of the leading advocates of open borders, wrote in 1987: “Free migration may not be immediately achievable, but it is a goal toward which we should strive.”
This is an extract from Rutger Bregman’s book Utopia for Realists: The Case for a Universal Basic Income, Open Borders, and a 15-Hour Workweek."

Rutger Bregman: It’s time to think utopian ","Rutger Bregman is reimagining utopia. The 28-year-old Dutch historian and author says we have all the ideas we need, including the 15-hour work week, open borders and a universal basic income
What’s your vision of utopia for realists?
When we think of progress these days we only really think of technology. We don’t really think of the social ways we could change things. We lack radical vision. The bigger idea of my book, Utopia for Realists, is that we need to relearn how to think utopian. I propose ideas for real progress such as the universal basic income, the 15-hour working week and open borders. They’re old ideas, but I try to breathe new life into them.
What inspires and motivates you?
Ideas throughout history. The 15-hour work week is an old concept that goes back to economist John Maynard Keynes (1883–1946). As a historian I was looking at the fact that in the 50s, 60s and 70s, the left and the right believed that the working week would continue to shrink with things like automation, and we would all be left working out the big question of how to live a good life. But in today’s labour market we struggle with work-related burnout and depression. I also wondered why we still have poverty in rich countries.
What would a society with a 15-hour working week look like?
For some of us the line is blurred between work and what we love, so our lives wouldn’t change much. But for many, there is a clear distinction between what’s work and the rest of life. A poll last year in the UK asked people whether they found their jobs meaningful – 37 per cent said no. I think we need to work less in certain jobs in order to do more of what matters and what is meaningful and important to society, such as caring and volunteering.
What is the role of the universal income in your utopia?
It’s about eradicating poverty. It’s about real positive freedom, about being given the means to actually get up and do something that you love, that matters, without being worried about paying rent.
Could a universal basic income work?
It’s due to be trialled in 20 cities in the Netherlands from January 2017, as well as in Finland and Canada.
In the 1970s, a fascinating universal basic income experiment started in Dauphin, Canada. It raised 1,000 families above the poverty level. An army of researchers descended on the town to monitor the effects. But a few years later, a conservative government pulled the plug before any analysis.
More than 25 years later, Canadian economist Evelyn Forget accessed the archives and discovered it had been a huge success: kids performed better at school, demand for healthcare dropped, and people were able to spend more time on things that mattered.
It also didn’t reduce the motivation to work. In fact, mental health improved and shame decreased.
US president Richard Nixon even came close to introducing it in the 70s, but was dissuaded.
How would open borders help?
By far the most effective tool we have for fighting poverty is migration. When 60 per cent of income is dependent on where you’re born, borders are the biggest source of injustice in the world. Research from the World Bank shows that if richer countries allowed in three per cent more migrants, this would do more than three times as much as all development aid combined.
The world is wide open for everything but people; globally, a huge amount of human talent and potential is being wasted. Seven different studies have shown that, depending on the level of movement in the global labour market, the estimated growth in ‘gross worldwide product’ would be in the range of 67 per cent to 172 per cent. Effectively, open borders would make the whole world twice as rich and pull more people out of poverty.
How can people be convinced of this?
The problem is we base our worldview nowadays on the media. Most people in western countries are pretty happy individually, but when asked about their country they say it’s all going downhill. The news is almost always pessimistic. It’s about the exceptions, not about the banality of the good, not the many tiny acts of kindness that happen every day.
Do we need more positive news?
We need journalists to tell new stories about our world. In the Netherlands there were more people volunteering to help refugees than there were refugees. My sister called me to say she was on a waiting list to help. But the media isn’t interested in this.
The journalism platform I work for, The Correspondent, tries to look much more at structural trends instead of the exceptions. I think it all starts with thinking differently, talking differently: journalists have a huge responsibility.

New issue of Positive News offers hope in uncertain times ","Published in the aftermath of the Brexit vote, the new issue of Positive News magazine reports on people, communities and organisations that are creating the building blocks for a thriving society
Following the turmoil of the UK’s historic vote to leave the European Union, amid slumping financial markets, a spike in hate crimes and political party divides, the latest issue of Positive News magazine offers a solution-focused perspective on key social issues.
“Now more than ever we need a lens on the world that spreads inspiration rather than fear,” says Positive News editor-in-chief Seán Dagan Wood.
Published on 12 July, the magazine’s cover features ‘utopian realist’ Rutger Bregman. The Dutch author and historian is interviewed about how he is breathing new life into some long-standing ideas for a fairer, more caring society, such as a 15-hour working week and universal basic income.
It is through serious optimism that we will legitimise the foundations of a thriving society
Another leading feature in the quarterly magazine shares the stories of refugees who, having overcome persecution in their native countries, have now settled in London. Alongside portraits by award-winning photographer Caroline Irby, their stories are uncovered through a focus on the moment that they first felt at home in the UK.
The new issue also reports on community resilience in the face of Rio de Janeiro’s often destructive race to the Olympics; explores how performance art is bringing hope to isolated young people in northernmost Canada; and considers what it really means to eat sustainably.
“It can feel vulnerable to risk thinking utopian in the face of life’s hurts, unknowns and a tense political atmosphere,” says Wood. “But it is through some serious optimism, giving more attention to practical examples and ideas for positive change, that we will legitimise the foundations of a truly thriving society.”
Following its #OwnTheMedia crowdfunding campaign last year, Positive News is now a pioneering media co-operative, owned by its readers and supporters globally. It publishes constructive journalism, a field that is gaining traction and recognition as understanding grows about the impact of news on our perspectives, wellbeing and how people engage in society.
The latest issue of Positive News magazine (issue 86, quarter three 2016) will be launched on Tuesday 12 July in conjunction with a photography exhibition held by charity Breaking Barriers, at the Proud Archivist in London, from 6:30pm. The exhibition, which runs until 18 July, will display portraits of London-based refugees, telling the stories of how they found freedom in the UK. Some of the photography in the exhibition is also featured in the new issue of Positive News magazine. For more information see: facebook.com/BreakingBarriersUK/

Sharing the vision ","Editor-in-chief Seán Dagan Wood introduces issue 86 of Positive News
“Another world is not only possible, she is on her way. On a quiet day, I can hear her breathing”, wrote the author Arundhati Roy.
The practical ideas are there. I’ve seen their journeys through our pages. First it might be a whisper in an interview. Months later, it will re-emerge in a news piece as a pioneering community puts it into practice. Then, it reoccurs a few years down the line in a feature about a global movement.
Universal basic income and a shorter working week are among such ideas gaining ground, which Dutch author Rutger Bregman brings our attention to. “We lack radical vision,” he says, in our interview with him. “We need to relearn how to think utopian.”
Bregman knows the statistics that create a foundation for the pursuit of utopia; the facts that defy the mainstream media’s doom and gloom narrative. By many measures, the world is now dramatically more peaceful and prosperous than during the bulk of human history.
But there remains unacceptable suffering and injustice, and we face social and environmental crises that threaten to undo our gains.
The world is now dramatically more peaceful and prosperous than during the bulk of human history
Within the prosperity of the rich world there is also deep discontent. Hence the “search for belonging, spirituality, meaning and community”, which academics identify as lying behind an explosion of interest in ritual – ceremonies and habits that connect us with others, with what we value and with a bigger story. We explore this in the issue, as the concept of ritual becomes liberated from the confines of state and religion.
Similarly, we head to Inuit communities in the Arctic to report on a circus connecting young people with their cultural roots in the face of an alarming suicide rate.
One of Bregman’s cornerstone ideas, controversially perhaps, is for countries to have open borders. The refugees we spoke to might agree, as we share their stories of what it took to feel at home again.
Likewise, we report on Glasgow’s success in embracing cultural diversity as people from the Roma community integrate with the city’s other residents. And this quarter, our Solutions Lab section investigates some of the diverse ways we might increase opportunities for people with disabilities.
In his book, Utopia for Realists, Bregman urges us to form new collectives with a shared idealism. The community around Positive News is such a collective.
Whether Bregman’s proposals are ones we aspire to, or we have very different ideals, it can feel vulnerable to risk thinking utopian in the face of life’s hurts, unknowns and a tense political atmosphere. But it is by engaging, together, in some serious optimism that we will legitimise the foundations of another world.
For us, another world is not only possible, it’s making our headlines.

For Jerusalem’s young men, parkour is freedom ","In a city where violence is commonplace and local people – young Arab men in particular – are viewed with suspicion by the authorities, Genevieve Belmaker finds one group using parkour to not only improve their fitness, but find a sense of freedom
In the shadows of a city with a tense and violent history of thousands of years, some young residents have turned the ancient streets of Jerusalem into their playground. Over the past five years, young Arab boys and men ranging in age from about 11 to 23 have taken up the sport known as parkour.
Parkour is the discipline of using one’s body and existing structures to move quickly and efficiently in any environment using only the body. It employs the methods of running, jumping, flipping and quadrupedal movements. Originating in France in the 1980s, it has since become popular within Israel, the West Bank and Gaza.
In Jerusalem the sport often comes with the added danger of police who are on heightened alert over the activities of young Arab men. That’s not without reason: since September 2015 there were dozens of knife attacks perpetrated by Arabs in Israel, including many in Jerusalem. This doesn’t change the fact that the vast majority of the more than 100,000 Arab residents of Israel’s largest city, Jerusalem, live in peace.
Such simple joy is hard to find anywhere in the world, but here it is especially captivating
One of Jerusalem’s loosely organised parkour groups is led by Oday Abu Snina, a 16-year-old city resident. There are dozens of parkour enthusiasts in the city, all male, who practice to different skill levels.
The story of parkour is unique among the stories that a foreign correspondent might encounter. There is little, if any, of the usual politics of the conflict involved. It’s a special challenge to keep pace with teenage boys who practice acrobatics in their spare time and can slip in and out of the crevices of the city in the blink of an eye. Most of all, to watch them in action is pure joy.
The world around disappears. Time stops. There is nothing but watching, breathless, as they make one dangerous jump after another. Every time they land on their feet or crash but avoid injury, it is cause for celebration. Such simple joy is hard to find anywhere in the world, but here it is especially captivating.
Despite the fact that he fits the profile for the most oft-harassed and suspected cross-section of his city’s population, Snina is undeterred from his beloved sport. He is always smiling, always positive and brimming with health and energy.
It’s difficult not to connect parkour to his upbeat approach to life.
“Parkour is freedom,” he says as he was practices moves with his friends in Jerusalem’s Old City. “It is part of our life.”
Since Snina has been doing parkour for about two years, he is usually the most experienced among his group and ends up playing the role of coach. They come from some of the roughest neighbourhoods in the city: Silwan, Shuafat refugee camp, Issawiya and Abu Tor. They face daily scrutiny and sometimes harassment by police as they go about their lives.
Mohammed Sarhan is a 16-year-old resident of Shuafat refugee camp. The neighbourhood is just north of Jerusalem and is notorious for the lack of municipal control by either the Palestinian authorities or Jerusalem. By all accounts, the camp of 80,000 people would be a difficult place to live as a teenage Arab boy, and has become even more so over the past couple of years with lone-wolf acts of violence throughout Jerusalem.
There is nothing but watching, breathless, as they make one dangerous jump after another
Sarhan says he is confronted with these harsh realities every day.
“This morning some police stopped me,” he says, noting that he was on his way to school. “They said ‘open your bag, empty your pockets.’”
Sarhan says he sees the police hit and harass people every day and that he feels trapped.
“This is my motherland, but I feel like I’m in jail,” he says.
But rather than take to the streets and throw stones at police – as so often happens in this part of the world – Sarhan took up parkour. He’s been practising with Snina and their friends for a few months now. When he practices running, jumping, flipping off walls and flying through the air, it makes the tensions on the ground dissolve.
When he does parkour he says he feels like “a bird in the sky.”
Though parkour practitioners in Jerusalem use various locations to practice, the Old City is considered a prime location. That 500-year-old Ottoman walls of earthen-coloured stone surround a labyrinth of low-rise buildings with flat rooftops and endless stone structures of varying shapes and sizes that are perfect for propelling into the air. Curious bystanders often stop to watch, but they are typically left alone.
The Old City, though a major tourist destination as it is full of historical sites, has also been the site of much violence. Tensions often run higher there than anywhere else in the city, and in the past year numerous young Arab men have been shot dead just outside the gates by police.
Yet Snina and his friends persist. Even if the police sometimes grumble or point a gun at them just for flipping off of a wall.
For these boys, parkour is also a physical fitness regimen. Snina helps the other boys in his group, some as young as 13, as they practice various moves. He shows them how to warm up, encourages them to try new and bolder moves, and spots the less experienced guys so they won’t fall. He even promotes healthy habits.
“Parkour prevents us from smoking,” he says. “Smoking is dangerous.”
His positive attitude is enough to make any parent, teacher or coach proud. Yet Snina isn’t above making wry jokes about the reality he lives in.
“If some police followed me, I can get away,” he laughs, recounting a day last year when he noticed police observing him. Rather than stop and engage, he simply scaled a high fence using parkour moves. He said the police were so confused they just stood on the other side and watched him walk away.
The tropes applied to young Arab men in Jerusalem are so strong, in fact, that Snina and his fellow parkour enthusiasts are convinced they are doing something illegal by flipping and jumping in the park.
“The police told us we are not allowed to do this,” says Sarhan.
Abdallah Abusara, 16, is working on perfecting handstands atop walls and large rocks. For him, the ability to practice parkour freely (even though he’s been told he can be arrested for it) is all the hope he needs for the future.
“It’s justice,” he says.

Through my lens: a warm Finnish welcome ","Photographer Ilvy Njiokiktjien describes what it was like to capture images of refugees in a Finnish sauna
I was covering a story at a refugee centre in Helsinki, waiting for a journalist colleague, when I saw a group of Iraqi and Syrian men carrying towels. They told me they were going to a traditional Finnish sauna. Jokingly, they invited me to join them. They looked rather surprised when I answered: “Yes, please!”
Unlike the almost naked men, I was still wearing all my outdoor gear. Sweating in my heavy winter layers, I started shooting. It was interesting to see how the group brought their own traditions to the experience. They laughed and sang throughout, and even added in a traditional washing ceremony – Turkish hammam-style.
Afterwards, I found out that the sauna owner lets refugees use his facilities free of charge. “I’m happy they can experience the brotherhood and friendship that is created during a sauna ritual,” he told me.

‘Media needs to find its responsibility again’ says UN director general ","Michael Møller urges news outlets to inform and empower citizens more effectively by adopting constructive journalism
The United Nations has called for a sea change in the world’s media, urging the adoption of more constructive, solutions-focused reporting to galvanise people towards positive social change.
Michael Møller, director general at the United Nations Office at Geneva, joined editors from some of the UK’s biggest media outlets – from tabloid newspapers to major television broadcasters – at an event in central London on Wednesday morning to discuss constructive journalism. The event was also attended by representatives of the third sector.
Møller warned that a negativity bias in much of the mainstream media stands in the way of progress and urged outlets to “change their modus operandi”. He called for reporting to be based on “facts and empathy” to a much greater degree than at present, and said “bringing in more positive, solution-focused stories is a must.”
Speaking to Positive News, Møller said: “The responsibility of the media, to me, is to inform, educate and to hold power to account. I think that on the educational part, a lot of media around the world has abdicated its responsibility. It needs to find its responsibility again.”
At a time when digital connectedness enables mass awareness of humanitarian challenges, people could rise to meet them, said Møller – if they receive accurate, useful and balanced information from the media.
“We have the expertise, we have the experience, the human capital, the financial means, it’s just a matter of getting our act together globally,” he said.
“We are moving into a world of incredible change. We have technology today that gives almost every person on this planet the ability to know everything that happens, but also the ability to comment. Many of these voices are fairly uninformed and based on very narrow personal agendas and local understandings of reality. It is very, very important that this cacophony of voices is as informed as possible.”
Changing narratives around refugees
Møller referred to much of the media’s portrayal of the European refugee crisis as a case in point. Not only did narratives lack sufficient facts and coverage of solutions, they fuelled stereotypes, leading to “extraordinarily negative” reporting, he said.
“The narrative on who [the migrants] are, but also that there’s this tsunami of people descending on Europe, is simply wrong. The fact that we need many of these people is completely forgotten.”
Migration will be a central element of our lives for decades to come, he added. “We can’t solve the problem by closing doors. Climate change will cause millions to move. The reality on this planet is such that, unless we do something dramatic, most of us are going to be affected in ways that we are now seeing others being affected. The level of collective responsibility for how our planet is run is such that we can no longer think we can do it alone: either as a community or a country or as individuals.”
Informing people about solutions that are being worked on should sit alongside holding politicians to account on how they are addressing global issues, said Møller.
“One of the big problems in the world right now is that our short term political structures are at odds with the long term needs. Most politicians are looking at three or five-year horizons to be re-elected and it’s becoming more and more of a problem. That’s where the media can come in, to provide the continuity. To remind them of their commitments.”
Sir Martyn Lewis, Positive News patron and chair of National Council for Voluntary Organisations (NCVO), first made a stand against media negativity when he was a BBC news presenter in the 1990s. Lewis chaired the event in London on Wednesday, which was convened by Constructive Voices – a project run by NCVO to encourage socially-useful, constructive journalism. It also aims to link media with stories from the voluntary sector and social enterprises.
Lewis said that the unprecedented gathering reflected a surging interest in constructive journalism.
“Key people came together to discuss the subject: editors, representatives of the voluntary sector and social entrepreneurs, for a very frank discussion,” he said.
“It was fascinating to see the range of approaches, with almost everyone agreeing on the need for constructive journalism. The question now is how to overcome the obstacles at national newspapers, such as a lack of resources, and the need to build relationships between journalists and the people or organisations working on solutions.”
Positive News editor-in-chief and co-founder of the Constructive Journalism Project, Seán Dagan Wood, said: “We are seeing the beginnings of a cultural shift across the media as the industry realises the value, for both itself and the public, of good journalism about progress and possibility.
“Media must continue to hold power to account and expose problems, but while doing so we can empower people by also investigating potential solutions. This is not about feel good stories or advocacy. It is about informing people in a way that contributes to a fuller picture of truth and creates a space for society to respond more effectively to its challenges.
“The press can maintain a critical journalistic approach alongside a constructive mindset, applying its valuable expertise to producing compelling stories about how problems are being tackled. I know that the public want this, and I believe we’ll continue to see forward-thinking media move towards this approach.”

Peace is priority for new Myanmar government ","New democratic government will make peace its top priority, says Aung San Suu Kyi
“Our government will be based on a policy of national reconciliation,” promised veteran democracy campaigner Aung San Suu Kyi in January. Suu Kyi’s National League for Democracy party won a historic victory in November. She promised to strive to expand negotiations with the country’s many ethnic minority guerrilla groups amid long-running conflicts.
Myanmar’s shaky transition to democracy, following a military junta between 1962-2011, has left the army with sweeping powers over border regions. This limits the government’s ability to broker a lasting ceasefire, said Myra Dahgaypaw, a Burmese refugee who works as a policy analyst for the US Campaign for Burma.
“I believe she wants to bring about peace, and that she understands the suffering of the people,” Dahgaypaw said. “But I’m doubtful that she can do it, unless she’s given power over the military.”
That would take a “miracle”, Dahgaypaw said. In the meantime, she believes it is up to the international community to keep pressing for an end to conflict.

Torture survivors find bravery in bread ","How baking is helping torture survivors start a new life
In a room overlooking a rainy garden in north London, a grown man is crying. He is from Iran, and fled to the UK after being tortured by authorities there. This morning he received a letter from the Home Office asking him to come for another interview. He is terrified that he might be sent back.
The man, who has asked me to call him Daniel*, is part of a group of torture survivors from around the world who meet every week at the charity Freedom from Torture to bake bread and support each other. Alex*, another member of the group, gives Daniel a hug. “I had a bad experience of interviews,” says Daniel, his face blank with fear. “My mind is very busy now.”
The bread group was set up by two therapists, Saba Stefanos and Shamsi Mahdavi, employed by the charity and has been running for 10 years. “We thought bread is a common thing for everyone,” says Stefanos of the decision to base the group around baking. “It’s a staple food in every society. The bread brings together the past and the present. They can talk about who made the bread back home, how they ate it together. It enables people who are not able to talk, to talk. And they discover a creativity they never thought they had.”
Just over 29,000 people claimed asylum in the UK between September 2014 and September 2015 – the highest number since 2005, including increased numbers from Eritrea, Syria, Sudan and Iraq. Independent clinical research estimates that up to one third of those had been tortured.
“When you leave, you leave everything. It’s not your choice. And then when you come here your hope is gone. You feel afraid. A lot of people believe what they read in the newspapers. They should not.”
The charity received 1,313 referrals last year, more than a fifth of them children and young people. Survivors came from 78 countries in total, with the highest numbers from Sri Lanka, Iran, Pakistan, Afghanistan and the Democratic Republic of Congo.
“People have had traumatic experiences,” says Stefanos. “They don’t necessarily want to talk about it or maybe they can’t. Perhaps being in a situation with other people who have been through similar things is more therapeutic than therapy.”
Members of the bread group are at different stages of the asylum process, with some having been given either 30 months’ discretionary leave to remain or five years’ asylum or humanitarian protection, while others are still in limbo, not knowing whether they will be allowed to stay. Those who have had their claims accepted – sometimes after years of waiting – are now finally beginning to look for work. Those who are still awaiting a decision, are appealing against a decision or are putting forward a fresh claim are not allowed to work. Instead, they receive support in the form of temporary accommodation, wherever it is offered, and an Azure payment card with £35.39 to spend per week in specified shops. The card cannot be used on public transport.
Back home, the members of the bread group worked in healthcare, fashion, catering or were studying full-time; here some of them have had periods living on the streets, in cars or in mice-infested rooms. “I never thought I would live in a country where I wasn’t born,” Alex tells me. “When you leave, you leave everything. It’s not your choice. You leave to save your life. And then when you come here your hope is gone. You feel afraid. A lot of people believe what they read in the newspapers. They should not.”
Kolbassia Haoussou, a former Freedom from Torture client who set up Survivors Speak OUT within the charity to give clients more of a voice, says negative news coverage of immigrants, refugees and asylum seekers makes life even more difficult. “There is a very strong political will against asylum in the UK,” he says. “What the population get is politicians labelling people seeking safety as unwelcome people, people who create problems, people we need to push away, and the population take it as fact. It creates hostility and sets people against each other.”
“It enables people who are not able to talk, to talk. And they discover a creativity they never thought they had.”
Carla Ferstman, director of Redress, which campaigns against torture worldwide, says there is a direct correlation between torture and the current numbers of asylum seekers trying to enter Europe. “Many of those seeking asylum have been tortured in their home countries and fear torture if they are involuntarily returned,” she says. “Additionally some asylum seekers have been tortured or ill-treated en route, particularly in the staging countries for people smugglers…Furthermore, the practice of detaining asylum seekers and refugees on their arrival in Europe has led to significant examples of torture and ill-treatment, including allegations of rape and sexual exploitation in detention.”
Ferstman says not enough effort is being made to identify torture survivors and ensure they receive the necessary care. Meanwhile, historic allegations of British involvement in post-9/11 rendition, including Guantanamo Bay, and of torture and ill treatment of detainees by British service personnel in Iraq, are not being properly investigated, she says. “The government has consistently said that it abhors torture in all its forms and has taken a leading role in international efforts to prevent torture,” she says. “But unfortunately, it has been less swift to address torture in which its officials have been allegedly involved.”
Back in the garden room, Daniel has put an apron over his black puffer jacket and jeans and has selected ingredients from a trolley laden with flours, herbs and oils to make a flatbread with black seeds. Lee* adds teaspoons of sugar, chocolate and instant coffee to his dough. “Sometimes it’s very difficult to chat with someone else because you don’t really trust them and because your experience is very complicated for someone to understand,” he says. “Here we share our experiences and we support each other.”
Alex is already on his third batch. “Coconut bread is my speciality but today I do something new,” he tells me. He says being in the bread group has given him back his confidence to speak and trust other people again. “The special thing here is there is no judgement,” he says. “Everyone appreciates what we do.”
At the end of the session, Stefanos puts out a plate with the breads fresh from the oven and we sit and eat. Alex is thoughtful. “When I come here, I can relax,” he says. “I can share the pain I feel inside. I miss the group in between. Most of the time I feel alone, but here it is like going home.”
*Some names have been changed.
In December 2015, Freedom from Torture launched An A-Z of Poverty, a series of films by torture survivors about living in the UK. The films can be viewed here."

Five tips for a more caring social media life ","Online communities can often be hostile places filled with argument and abuse but, says Jeremy Adam Smith, if we set an intention to be supportive of each other online, we can transform the culture of social media
As news of the terrorist attacks in Paris spread through social media, responses followed a pattern I’ve come to know well.
First, shock and grief. Friends and followers share video and pictures that are almost pornographic in their intensity. The images appear with no context, and we see only running, screaming, guns, and blood.
After the shock, reactions start to split along lines that are ideological and temperamental. Some people are simply, understandably, angry. From them, I hear calls for vengeance. And, sometimes, they seem to be searching for scapegoats. On Twitter, in particular, I saw many calls to bar Syrian refugees because they might be carrying terrorists among their number. Arguments and threats spring up like dandelions.
There is another group, I find, that calls for caution, compassion, and understanding. Even the members of this network, however, start to turn on each other after a few days, often by targeting expressions of grief or solidarity.
“The friendships and communities you have on social media are real. It’s time to start acting like they matter.”
For example, many people “French-flagged” their profile pictures, overlaying faces with the tricolour. These were roundly criticized in my network, sometimes as racist. Critics ask: Why don’t you cover yourself in the colours of Iraqi or Lebanese flags when terrorism strikes those places? There are always commentaries from sites like the DailyKos or the Huffington Post that point out the imbalance of media coverage: Why Paris, and not Beirut? On social media, people become what journalist Jamiles Lartey calls “tragedy hipsters,” as in, “Bro – I care about suffering and death that you’ve never even heard of.” The status update becomes a status symbol, like a Prius.
It’s as if the terrorists injected a virus into our social networks that causes good people to turn on each other, like the rage-zombies in the movie 28 Days Later.
I’m using the Paris debates as an example, but I don’t think it’s controversial to say that in 2015, social media can be a vicious place, no matter what we’re debating. On platforms like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and 4chan, users trigger anxiety, stress, doubt, and even hatred in others, many of whom they call “friends.” Much of this activity takes the form of incessant policing of manners and language, which is why I sometimes call the Internet “the scolding machine.”
I don’t believe this is motivated by malice, necessarily, but rather by a need to exert some kind of power over a situation in which we feel otherwise powerless. Seeing violence over and over on social media triggers a subterranean fight-or-flight response, but since few of us are in a position to stop terrorists directly, we lash out at the closest targets.
It’s tempting to dismiss social media firestorms as a sideshow. The US cable news leader, Fox, has about 1.7m viewers during prime time. That sounds impressive. But a seventh of the world’s population visits Facebook every day. At any given moment, up to two billion people around the world will be logged into a social media site or app, according to my back-of-the-envelope calculation. Social media aren’t just a major source of news and opinion; they’ve also become a very significant place of community. There we spend time with far-flung family, friends, and colleagues. There we have some of the most meaningful discussions of our lives.
When the community becomes toxic, that hurts its members. Scientists have only just started to study the relationship between social media and wellbeing, but the evidence so far suggests that what we say, read, watch, and hear through social media shapes our mental health and even offline relationships like our marriages, according to a growing number of studies. One paper from this year, for example, found a link between death by heart disease and angry language on Twitter. That’s consistent with everything else we know about the link between social connections and subjective wellbeing. The friendships and communities you have on social media are real, if unprecedented.
It’s time to start acting like they matter. It’s time for us to pause and ask ourselves: as individual humans, how can we support each other’s wellbeing on social media?
Few studies have dealt directly with this question. The companies themselves have given some thought to how to design interactions so as to increase wellbeing. In fact, my Greater Good Science Center colleagues Dacher Keltner and Emiliana Simon-Thomas worked directly with Facebook to create changes that many users now take for granted, like giving friends kinder, more specific feedback on photographs you don’t like.
But few users, it seems to me, take responsibility for the wellbeing of communities they create through their social media accounts – that includes people I know who in real life would never dream of saying an unkind word to a stranger’s face but can be quite nasty on Facebook. Few seem to think about how the contagion of anger or contempt might infect the larger network. This becomes more, not less, important when a tragedy like Paris strikes.
Here are five suggestions, by no means comprehensive, for fostering the wellbeing of others online, based on a combination of my reading of the research and my experience.
Because the research is so shallow, and my experience so narrow, I invite readers to discuss these recommendations, and to please make their own in the comments.
1. Bring your best self to social media
There is a research-tested exercise we promote on Greater Good in Action called Best Possible Self for Relationships. I’ve found that applying this exercise to social media can be quite thought-provoking. It asks you to imagine your relationships going as well as they possibly could, and then writing that vision down. It’s really about self-discovery: Who do I want to be and what do I want out of life?
Here are the steps, which I’ve adapted for thinking about your social media persona:
You might even consider posting your vision to social media. Don’t be afraid: see what people have to say about your ideal social media space.
2. Cultivate a diverse social network
This to me is the foundation of a healthy life on social media.
Racial, cultural, and economic biases exist within me, you, institutions, across nations, and within nations around the globe. And so, so, so often I see good people generalise from data they see in their incredibly biased Facebook or Twitter feeds. I learned about the shootings in Kenya, the earthquake in Nepal, the Syrian refugee crisis, and more, from Facebook. In the same feed, I also saw people write, “Why is no one paying attention to the shootings in Kenya/earthquake in Nepal/the Syrian refugee crisis?!” Seemingly unaware that this isn’t true of everyone or of everyone’s social network.
It’s a hard truth: imbalance in your social media feeds doesn’t reflect media bias. It reflects your bias.
“Your first goal should be to understand the other person’s perspective and accept it for what it is, even if you disagree with it.”
To correct for this, I often work to add friends (even ones I don’t know) who I think will add to the depth and richness of how I see the world. I also try to be aware that my efforts will always fall short. You can’t eliminate bias; you can only mitigate and manage it. Over the years, I’ve consciously built an online social network that includes family, friends from every stage of my life, writers of all kinds, journalists, psychologists, and more, as well as people of many different races, cultures, and economic backgrounds. This diversity is one of the gifts that life has given me, though sometimes it can feel like a curse, especially when these different and diverse people start bickering on my Facebook wall.
Yes, diversity can create conflict. It’s tempting to block or unfriend troublesome people, especially when you yourself disagree with them.
Here’s what I think: the difference between a well-rounded human and a one-dimensional fanatic is that the human remembers that he or she can be wrong. Of course, you should be sceptical of everything you read online. But you should also try to be sceptical of yourself. When you feel that dopamine rush of righteousness coming on, STOP. Hit pause. Take a breath. Do your own research, especially when the facts and explanations seem to confirm your pre-existing beliefs. Sometimes you’ll mess up. I do, all the time. Big deal. Admit you’re wrong, forgive yourself, and try to do better next time. When someone else is wrong, try to forgive them.
Diversity doesn’t really work without humility.
3. Highlight what your friends have in common
How do social media turn good people into nasty ones?
Part of the answer lies in the one-dimensionality of the interaction. If someone is not personally known to you, they are just a name on the screen, and all we know about them is one tweet or comment. It seems to me that one of the reasons why Twitter is so vicious is that followers are not bi-directional friends, the way they are on Facebook. This makes it more difficult for you to create and facilitate a community of different people.
I try, as much as possible, to show people I know what disparate friends might have in common, especially at points of conflict. “Peter and Sarah you disagree about gun control, but did you know you both graduated from the University of Florida?” Or perhaps, “I still love you both!”
Sounds cheesy – let’s face it, most of what I’m saying here sounds cheesy – but it works in defusing tense moments. You’re making them both feel like they’re part of the same in-group, and there are a stack of studies showing that this will increase the pro-social tendencies of all the parties involved.
The important thing to remember is that your social media connections are an in-group that you created. When they comment on something you’ve shared, they are guests in your home. A good host generates a convivial atmosphere by helping everyone to feel included in the conversation.
A word about racism, sexism, and other forms of identity-based discrimination: I don’t tolerate the denigration of entire groups of people in my networks, and I don’t think you should either. Does this contradict what I’m saying about having a diverse network? I agree there’s some ambiguity, but I simply don’t want, for example, women or people of colour to feel uncomfortable inside the community I create with my account. I brought them together; I try to keep them safe from abuse. You may disagree with me, of course. We all have different limits. But this too, in my opinion, is part of cultivating other people’s wellbeing online.
4. Try some active listening
It’s really hard to listen to people on social media.
In face-to-face conversation, active listening means expressing interest in what a person has to say. This can be as simple as making eye contact or lightly touching their hand as they speak, but it’s really a deeper exercise in trying to truly empathise with another person, especially during a difficult conversation. Here’s what that might look like online, again adapted from Greater Good in Action:
Of all the steps I’m proposing, this to me feels the most difficult. On social media, we take turns; there’s no opportunity for non-verbal feedback as we speak. For active listening to work online, we need more patience, not less, than we do in real life.
5. Promote positive messages and images
After the Paris attacks, divisive poison and fear-inducing imagery flooded my feeds. Then one of my friends shared this video, of a blindfolded Muslim man hugging strangers on a Paris street:
I felt my heart lift. And then other friends shared this BBC video of a man whose wife had been shot to death in Paris:
This is imagery that induces “moral elevation,” which psychologist Jonathan Haidt defines as “a warm, uplifting feeling that people experience when they see unexpected acts of human good­ness, kindness, courage, or compassion. It makes a person want to help others and to become a better person himself or herself.”
In a study published this year, 104 college students watched videos depicting heroic or compassionate acts while researchers measured their heart rates and brain activity. They found that witnessing suffering triggered a stress response, but that then seeing suffering alleviated through a caring, selfless act produced a sense of relief the students felt throughout their bodies. The researchers specifically saw activity in the medial prefrontal cortex, a part of the brain associated with empathy and “theory of mind” – our ability to predict behaviour in other people.
In short, witnessing acts of goodness helps us to feel connected to humanity, while witnessing violence cuts us off from others. Elevation helps turn the stress response from fight-or-flight into tend-and-befriend. That’s why when friends share images that elevate me and help me to feel connected, I am grateful and I share it on.
The bottom line? If we want to transform the culture of social media, we have to set an intention to be supportive of each other online. Kind, compassionate, honest, grateful, and forgiving. There’s a place for anger or snark, but that shouldn’t be our default setting, especially when we communicate with people whom we call friends.

Regreening Africa could help both people and environment, says report ","A new report on the impact of deforestation in Africa suggests that integrating more trees and shrubs into farmland could not only benefit the environment, but also improve food security and even reduce the likelihood of people becoming refugees
Many parts of Africa have been deforested by the expansion of agricultural land. This loss of trees has many detrimental effects. Soil erosion increases because trees no longer block wind and their roots no longer hold soil together. Soil fertility decreases because the input of nutrients in the form of organic matter like leaves from trees vanishes. Renewable sources of fuel and building materials are lost when trees are removed to convert land to agricultural landscapes.
Chris Reij and Robert Winterbottom, senior fellows of the World Resources Institute, have written a report detailing efforts to reverse the trend of deforestation in agricultural landscapes in Africa, a practice that they define as “regreening.” In the report Scaling Up Regreening: Six Steps to Success, A Practical Approach to Forest and Landscape Restoration, Reij and Winterbottom describe methods by which regreening may be able to occur at landscape levels.
The authors define regreening success as “situations in which significant numbers of farmers, individually or collectively, have developed ways to protect, regenerate, and sustainably manage an increased number of shrubs and trees in their farming systems.”
The objective of their report is to provide a framework for farmers and policy makers in governments and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) to develop regreening success at meaningful scales. In the report, Reij and Winterbottom explain the challenge of defining the scale at which regreening success needs to be developed, and why it is important to do so.
“Regreening is a practical and relatively low cost approach to begin to address issues of degradation, rural poverty, food insecurity and vulnerability to climate change.”
“The meaning of ‘regreening at scale’ depends on the context. It can refer to farmers regreening thousands or even millions of hectares over the course of several years or a couple of decades. If millions of hectares of agricultural land are degrading because of wind or water erosion and depletion of soil fertility, then it does not help when these problems are addressed on a few hundred or even a few thousand hectares. The problem needs to be addressed on millions of hectares.”
The authors use the Seno Plain in Mali as a case study of large-scale regreening. This deforested region of West Africa has been regreened to the extent that there are now 450,000 hectares of what the authors term “medium to high-density parkland,” meaning that much of this land now has trees and shrubs again. Most of this regreening has been achieved by a process called farmer-managed natural regeneration (FMNR), defined by the authors as “the protection and management of naturally occurring trees and shrubs regenerated through roots and seeds present in the soil.”
The authors believe regreening may offer a possible solution to the chronic economic and political instability in some regions of Africa.
“Certainly, we can expect more rural households to be facing increased hardships from climate change, and increased likelihood of becoming refugees if nothing is done to address the root causes of land degradation, declining agricultural production and increased food insecurity, chronic poverty, etc,” Winterbottom told Mongabay. “And we think scaling up regreening (particularly FMNR) is a practical and relatively low cost approach to begin to address these issues of degradation, rural poverty, food insecurity and vulnerability to climate change.”
Regreening may even help reduce the instability that causes refugee migration.
“We don’t have the hard evidence, but experience points to that direction,” Reij told Mongabay. “In 2001 we did a study in Burkina Faso in villages with and without investments in water harvesting and agroforestry and the demographic dynamics between the ‘with’ and ‘without’ case were evident: negative demographic growth in villages without (with one exception) and positive demographic growth in villages with investments.
“It’s not possible to stop migration entirely, but investments in regreening/restoration create income earning opportunities and they help slow down migration.”
In addition to Mali, the report describes regreening case studies in Ethiopia, Malawi, and the Sahel region of Niger. From their findings, Reij thinks that regreening and the agroforestry systems that support it can benefit most regions of Africa. “I would argue that all situations with high population densities and wall-to-wall agriculture offer opportunities for developing or intensifying agroforestry systems,” he said.
However, even if regreening can indeed improve agricultural conditions and related issues like food security, how likely is it to catch on in Africa? Winterbottom and Reij think the odds are good that it can be practiced widely.
“There is a growing community of development practitioners, supporters and technical specialists working on food security, climate change resilience, poverty reduction and other sustainable development goals and objectives that have observed the benefits of regreening and are considering how to scale up adoption of regreening practices and extend those benefits to more people,” Winterbottom said.

Reij added: “A movement is slowly but surely developing around regreening. In April a regional conference for Southern Africa was held in Malawi and it drew 560 participants from many African countries.”
But while awareness of regreening is spreading through the agricultural development community in Africa, there are still obstacles to mainstream acceptance.
“Several people from the Bill Gates Foundation have been briefed on the results and benefits of regreening, and the widespread adoption of FMNR and related practices…regreening still does not appear to be mainstreamed in their programs – perhaps because they rely on agronomists and crop scientists who have a tendency to ignore the value and contribution of trees and shrubs on cropland,” Winterbottom said. “But with climate change, and the observed limitations of conventional approaches in sustainably boosting yields while generating other benefits (increased supplies of fodder, firewood, diversification of sources of income and increased rural incomes, increased resilience to climate change, etc) particularly in Africa, in time, we are hopeful that Gates and others seeking to have a positive impact on agricultural production and food security will read the report and invest to a greater degree in scaling strategies for regreening.”

Humanity and kindness amongst the horror at Calais ","Rosie Strickland joined a Critical Mass mission to donate bikes to refugees in the notorious ‘Jungle’ at Calais – this is what she found
“It is a horrible place, all you can do is understand.” A text message from my Mum on arrival at the Calais refugee camp. Ironically at that moment I was thinking what an amazing place it was – people greeting us with broad smiles and handshakes, a place full of respect, openness, friendship and warmth.
I was part of a group of about 80 cyclists who took part in a social media-organised Critical Mass bike ride. We rode on second-hand bicycles from London to Calais to donate them to those in need living in the refugee camp.
The camp itself, also known as the Jungle, is five kilometres from Calais centre, where many of the refugees have to go daily to fill out the various bureaucratic forms and to look for work. The donated bikes will be used to make the journey between the camp and Calais easier and quicker. A three-hour round trip on foot reduced to an hour with a bicycle.
In the camp I met people from Darfur in Sudan where there has been genocide and civil war for over a decade. I saw scars on people’s bodies from torture, I saw photos of children and families left at home – living in abject poverty, but still smiling. I met people from Kurdistan in Iraq, which since last year has been under the control of ISIS-aligned forces, their people persecuted for their ethnicity. I met people from Syria, Afghanistan, Yemen and Pakistan. All of these people fleeing poverty, violence or both.
“Beneath the tragedy lies a painful, beautiful humanity of the most raw kind.”
We arrived en masse to hand out the bicycles – but the reality of the scale of donation and help that is needed there is beyond what our small party could offer. Beyond bikes, tents and sleeping bags, they need building materials, English language learning books, solidarity and most of all asylum.
We were mobbed for our bicycles before we could distribute them. We found ourselves in a situation where our ideals of what was deemed fair and just were directly challenged by the real situation of desperate people fighting for survival.

At exactly the right moment, a thunderstorm broke. I had been talking with Italian photographer Valerio Muscella during the bike squabble, watching the scene unfold as groups of young men ran across dunes carrying locked bundles of bikes. The general feeling in our group was that we had failed in our mission to deliver bikes to the most needy, we had seen them disappear, and we were left bereft in the middle of a lawless jungle of desperate people.
As the storm broke a young guy from one of the nearby huts skipped across holding a steaming mug and handed it to Valerio. He offered me one too, which I gladly accepted – a hot, sweet, Sudanese coffee. As the storm worsened we were invited into his small abode on top of a sand dune. Shell-shocked from the raucous bike handover, wet from the storm and without a place to go, suddenly the tables had turned as to who was helping who. It’s amazing how quickly you can make a friend in dire situations.
The night we shared in this simple hut was long but life-changing. We shared conversation, beer, nibbles and cigarettes. We conversed in Arabic, English and French, and tried to teach each other words and phrases in our respective languages. Our conversation didn’t go beyond the here and now. It was in our shared vulnerability, in that moment, that our inherent capacity to survive and take care of each other emerged.
“Suddenly the tables had turned as to who was helping who – it’s amazing how quickly you can make a friend in dire situations.”
I made friends in the camp that I will probably never see again. I discovered a strength in my humanity that can stretch beyond borders, nationhood, ethnicity or language. I saw clearly the journey my new friends had made, and I saw equally clearly the shaky foundations my own privileged life was built upon. But despite our apparent differences, even just for that moment, we were all in it together.
Tragic nuances pass you by as everyday occurrences in the Jungle. The man that leaves silently to go to the station to try to get to England, no-one says goodbye because they want him to get there, yet no-one says farewell because they want him to come back; the sincere apology that they cannot offer you dinner because the rain put the fire out and there is no gas. But beneath the tragedy lies a painful, beautiful humanity of the most raw kind. The eye contact across a dark hut with rain hammering down, a shared glass of beer, laughter, a coat thrown over your shoulders, a life story shared, the joy of music and learning lyrics in a different language; the self-respect in refusing charity, and in contrast the relief of an equal exchange.

We left the camp with a deep sense of irony and of our own privilege. How can it be possible that we can walk away, board a ferry, and reach England so easily when our friends fend for their lives in a lawless, sometimes ruthless, and filthy camp, fighting to be recognised as human?
The situation that drives people to the Jungle is political and economic, divorced from our common humanity. The camp in contrast is distinctly human. Kindness often prevails and despite the difficult circumstances, people look out for each other.

There are many ways to help the people in Calais – visit a camp and meet the people there, join a donation effort for desperately needed items, donate money into a local refugee fund or start up a support group of your own.
On Saturday 12 September there is a Solidarity with Refugees demonstration in London urging the UK government to do more. For more information see the Facebook event."

Pacifist perspectives on tackling the threat of Isis ","With the rise of Isis in the Middle East, what do pacifists make of the situation? Should foreign governments stop their force, or is such activity necessary for future peace? Feminist researcher and writer Cynthia Cockburn considers the dilemma
By the time Hitler attacked Austria in early 1938, the membership of the Women’s International League for Peace and Freedom (WILPF) was already deep in disagreement as to appropriate, and effective, strategies against such armed aggression. The dilemma had already been sharply posed by Italy’s invasion of Ethiopia in 1934, and Japan’s incursion into China in 1937.
From its ninth Congress in 1937 WILPF had issued a statement that recognised the situation as involving aggressors and victims. Notwithstanding, it affirmed ‘neutrality’, and stated a ‘firm and uncompromising’ position against arming or financing either side. Instead it urged that ‘every moral, diplomatic, political and economic means – except a food blockade – be applied to the aggressor’. But what, exactly, many WILPFers were asking themselves, does that mean? Do we suppose that a reasoned appeal will succeed? Do we urge negotiation, and if so with what incentives? Should we call for sanctions – an oil embargo for instance?
Then came the Munich conference of September 1938, at which Neville Chamberlain, on Britain’s behalf, concurred in Hitler’s annexation of a slice of Czechoslovakia. Some WILPF members proclaimed Chamberlain’s concession ‘a chance for peace’, others called it ‘a sham peace’. On 1 September 1939 Germany proved the latter right by invading Poland, the Munich agreement was torn up, and France and Britain declared war. Qualified and unqualified pacifism remained locked in struggle, equally impotent. All that remained to WILPFers for the duration of the war was humanitarian work with refugees.
Fast forward to the 21st century, and the word ‘fascism’ is current again. The self-proclaimed Islamic State (Isis) that now controls a large swathe of Iraq and Syria is increasingly perceived by those who oppose it, including many Muslims, as something more than a mere terrorist militia. Many are characterising it as neo-fascism, citing its moral authoritarianism, ideological supremacism and apparent intention to exterminate certain culturally-defined categories of people. They suggest, too, that Isis’s proclaimed intention to conquer the world and install a Caliphate invites a comparison with the Nazi project.
With the 1930s pacifist dilemma in mind, I took the opportunity, at WILPF’s Congress in The Hague in May, to ask some current members what they see as appropriate and effective responses to Isis.
There is already external military intervention in the conflict. Iran and its ally Hezbollah have armed forces in the region. The US, besides using its influence to strengthen the Iraqi army, began air strikes against IS in August 2014. The Kurdish fighting units, the peshmerga, of northern Iraq and north-eastern Syria, together with others sent across the Turkish border by the Kurdistan Workers Party (the PKK) are engaging Isis in ground battles.
In Rojava, in northern-eastern Syria, a Kurd-led semi-autonomous region is evolving, administered on lines of ‘democratic confederalism’, reflecting the political theory of imprisoned Kurdish leader, Abdullah Öcalan. Rojava’s peshmerga, the People’s Protection Units, have two elements – the YPG, male fighters, and the YPJ units, comprised solely of women, under female command. The women peshmerga are particularly motivated to rescue the hundreds, perhaps thousands, of Yazidi and other minority women captured and enslaved by Isis. Through my links with their supporters in Roj Women, the Kurdish women’s association in London, I have learned that they feel that they cannot hope to prevail against Isis unless its armed vehicles and heavy weaponry are destroyed by US air strikes.
So in my questions to WILPF women I hoped to discover how qualified and unqualified pacifism is expressed today. Would there be more agreement, this time round? I asked them: what would you say to the governments currently taking military action against Isis? Persist or stop? And what would you say to the Kurdish women peshmerga? We support your campaign? Or lay down your arms?
Two of the WILPFers I spoke with were born to families living under Nazism in the 1930s. Edith Ballantyne was born in 1922 in the German-speaking area of Czechoslovakia. She was a teenager when it was annexed by Hitler. Her family felt bitterly betrayed by Britain’s concessions at Munich. Luckily they were able to escape the region, to spend the war years as refugees. Inge Stemmler was born in 1930s Germany to parents who were strongly anti-fascist. The family fled to the Netherlands, but of course did not thereby escape Hitler’s war machine.

So when Inge says, of Isis, ‘this is fascism’, her conviction comes from experience. She is acutely aware of the persistence of fascism, and feels it important to name it as such, and to be always ready to resist it, by force of arms if necessary. She now believes the US bombing should continue “until they have finished the job”. She says, “Sometimes, you have to fight. It is important that Isis be stopped.”
Edith, for her part, is in no doubt that Nazism could not have been defeated without fighting. But she feels differently about the US military intervention against Isis. In the case of Iraq and Syria today, she believes, “Although it’s a situation where military action makes sense, bombing isn’t the answer. Too much is being destroyed, including innocent lives.” Besides, she fears it will draw yet more young men to Islamist extremism. Rather, we should be looking for the root causes of the rise of Isis.
Like other women I spoke with this week, Edith has no doubt that the United States itself has helped create the phenomenon of armed Islamist extremism, by its manoeuvres to control Middle Eastern oil supplies, by invading and occupying Iraq, by its arms exports to the region, by its support for Israel and betrayal of Palestinians, and every step in its ‘war on terror’ since 9/11. So, Edith would say, rather than try and destroy Isis from the air, the US and its allies should be giving positive, but non-military, assistance to those opposing Isis, and working by all possible means for political unity.
Then I reminded Inge and Edith of the Kurdish peshmerga women who are soldiering on the ground, risking their lives every day, to rescue women captured by Isis and to prevent more falling into their hands. I ask her, “When they say, ‘But we need those air strikes!’, how would you answer them? Would you say, ‘Lay down your arms?’”
Edith thinks a moment, then replies, “I don’t think so. Sitting here safely outside the war zone, we should understand them, not condemn them. To resist is a human right. However, in the long run we should not accept that militarism is the only response. We should seriously begin to build peacemaking mechanisms.”
In reply to the same question, Inge says, “As a WILPFer I would like to speak with the peshmerga women, hear what they say. Fascism is so dirty. It’s like an octopus, getting its tentacles into society, its racist idea of the superiority of one kind of person over another. I might well agree, and say to the Kurdish women, ‘Yes, you have to fight’.” But, she goes on to surmise, perhaps when it’s over they themselves might look back on their campaign and say, “That was not the way to do it.”
“We should be looking for the root causes of the rise of Isis.”
A third WILPFer I spoke with in the course of the Congress was less than half the age of Edith and Inge. Laila Alodaat is newer to WILPF, one of the team of fulltime employees, with particular responsibility for crisis response and the League’s Middle East and North Africa (MENA) programme. A Syrian, a lawyer, still engaged in practical work in her country as a WILPF representative, she is uncompromisingly pacifist. While vehemently opposed to Bashar Assad, she does not believe armed opposition is the solution to this devastating aggression. Syrian civilians were deceived into thinking that resorting to force will save them from extermination by Assad. Eventually their legitimate resistance was hijacked by possession of arms, with the result that many civilians were killed and others turned into warlords.
Similarly, Laila is unhesitating in condemning military intervention by the USA and its allies against Isis. “Bombing Isis,” she says, “has clearly not been a solution. It’s reproducing a cycle of violence and preventing serious consideration of non-military means of combating Isis. They should rethink their approach.”
She is convinced that Isis cannot be defeated by arms alone. She cites Iraq after the US invasion to prove that a military response serves only to perpetuate a culture of violence. Those who are bombing Isis now should make equal efforts, spend equal funds, she believes, on unarmed initiatives to combat this force.
Laila similarly would urge the Kurdish women peshmerga “to use the power they have to emphasise non-military means to ensure the freedom and wellbeing of civilians, women and men alike. And to create a space where women can be effective without having to take up arms.”
I was heartened and relieved to learn from Laila of many civil society groups in north-eastern Syria and neighbouring Iraq that are even now running effective humanitarian and human rights projects, despite the fighting. She herself is working closely with initiatives providing support for women, health and psycho-social care for survivors, and ensuring secular education for children.
Edith reminded me of the words in which British WILPF chairperson, Mrs. Barbara Duncan Harris, addressed the ‘pacifist dilemma’ in 1938. Writing to WILPF national sections, in the wake of Munich, she described pacifism as “the struggle for truth, the struggle for right, the struggle for clear political aims, for firm political will and action”. Pacifism is not, she believed, “the weak acceptance of fait accomplis achieved by brute force. Pacifism is a courageous initiative for a constructive policy of just peace.”

Survivors of war and torture united by music ","Stone Flowers – a musical group comprised of war and torture survivors – is releasing its new album Ngunda, proving that something beautiful can come out of unimaginable violence
“Music is a way of surviving. Music is a way to be understood. Music is life.”
These words come from the members of Stone Flowers, a music project that is both therapeutic and political, and which produces powerful, uplifting and beautiful music. The project has the rare quality of raising awareness on human rights abuses while having a positive, feel-good effect on participants and the audience.
The Manchester-based group is formed by survivors of war and torture who write and perform their own songs. Music allows them to express their experiences and emotions, and convey these to their audiences. They write about torture, home, family, war, hope and resilience in the languages and rhythms of their home countries, which include Iran, Kuwait, Sri Lanka, Sudan and the Democratic Republic of Congo.
“Participants feel it is important to tell their stories as a way of healing.”
Created four years ago, Stone Flowers is supported by the charity Musicians without Borders UK and Freedom from Torture North West. The group is performing live at numerous events and is now recording a new album, Ngunda, which will be launched at Amnesty International HQ in London on 5 June. The album takes its name from one of its 10 tracks, Ngunda Azali Mutu, which means “a refugee is a human being” in the Bantu language Lingala.
Many members come from cultures where music is central. The African women in the group often say that they “have a song for everything”. The Middle Eastern members draw on a strong musical heritage as well as an ancient culture of poetry to inform their melodies and lyrics. The result is a rich cornucopia of styles and influences, which includes Arabic poetry mixed with West African rhythms and English folk segued into Caribbean and Tamil songs.

Many Stone Flowers members have experienced torture, rape and unimaginable violence. They have lost their home, culture and family, as well as parts of themselves. “Music allows the expression of complex emotions without having to be cognitively acknowledged – it can go straight from emotions to expression without having to be coded verbally,” explains director of Musicians without Borders UK Lis Murphy.
Participants feel it is important to tell their stories as a way of healing, but also as a political gesture. “Most important is to communicate that refugees are human beings,” says one group member. “We are fighting for our human rights through our songs and raising awareness about torture because of the way we are viewed outside of our countries.”
The album was funded predominantly through crowdfunding appeals, although the group’s funding was recently boosted by grants from Woodward Charitable Trust and Salford CVS."

Inspiring stories of resilience ","Resilience is transmissible, says our Positive Psychology columnist Chris Johnstone. By sharing the stories that inspire us, we can pass it on
A strategy I teach during my courses on resilience is to identify inspiring examples. I ask participants to think of people who’ve faced difficult situations and responded in ways that led to better than expected outcomes. There’s often a buzz in the room as people share the stories they’ve been touched by. As the words flow, listeners tend to feel strengthened by what they hear. See if you experience something similar here, as I share one of my favourite examples.
I invite people to use a four-part story structure, which I demonstrate below. Each section begins with the first half of a sentence, with the storyteller using this as a springboard to launch into the example they share.
1) This is a story about…
Here you name the central character of your story, and say a bit about them. My example is a story about a photojournalist called Giles Duley, who I came across when I saw his TED talk online. Wanting to use his photography to do something useful in the world, he started to document the stories of people facing challenging situations. Spending time with Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh, people in care homes in the UK and street children in the Ukraine, his pictures opened a window into how adversities are lived with.
“Stories of resilience tend to have turning points where something shifts, new possibilities are opened and unexpected opportunities found”
2) The adversity faced is…
Resilience is about our ability to withstand, deal with and recover from difficult situations. So in this second section, you describe the adversity faced by the main character of your story. For Giles Duley, the adversity faced was stepping on a landmine while at work with his camera in Afghanistan. He lost three of his limbs. He thought his life as a photographer was over.
3) What helps here is…
What is it that helps resilience happen? For each person there may be choices they make, resources they turn to, strengths they draw upon or insights they apply. By becoming interested in the steps people take that help them deal with adversity we learn more about how resilience is done. For Giles Duley, what helped was remembering the lives of the people he’d photographed. He felt inspired by their stories and drew strength from them.
4) And that leads to…
What happens with resilience that might not have occurred without it? I value stories of resilience because they remind me that just because a story begins with ghastly things happening doesn’t mean things will always end badly. Stories of resilience tend to have turning points where something shifts, new possibilities are opened and unexpected opportunities found. Giles had wanted to use his photography to make a difference in the world, to tell the stories of others so that we might learn from them. Yet his own story became as powerful as any of his pictures, passing on lessons he’d learned and inspiration he’d gained. His TED talk has been watched more than 100,000 times.

Stories of resilience often begin with bad news, with tragedy and pain. Yet the story is made by what happens after that, by the dawn that follows the darkest hour. As Giles says in his talk: “Losing your limbs doesn’t end your life. Life goes on. We can inspire each to get through our own bad experiences.” When I’m struggling, when I reach my low points, I turn to my favourite resilience stories and value them as a source of strength. I think of Giles, telling myself: “If he can deal with that, then maybe I can deal with this.” Resilience is transmissible. By sharing the stories that inspire us, we can pass it on.

Waging nonviolence in war-torn Syria ","As Syria struggles under the weight of ongoing conflict, teams of ordinary citizens are staying to help people where others have fled – and saving lives in the process
A verse from the Qur’an – ‘Whoever saves a life, it will be as if he has saved all of humanity’ – is the motto of Syrian Civil Defence volunteers Ahmad Hamade and Muhammad Zikra.
Along with 2,050 volunteers across the country – a number that rises most months – the pair rescue survivors trapped under the rubble of president Bashir-al-Assad’s airstrikes. Their challenge is immense. Bombs fall on some neighbourhoods 50 times a day and, after three-and-a-half-years of civil war, the death toll now stands at over 191,000. According to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), nearly 50 percent of Syrians have now fled to other parts of the country or across the border.
Despite the risks, 40-year-old Hamade and Zikra have chosen to remain in the northwestern city of Idlib because as they say, via a crackling Skype connection, “when we stay, fewer people die”. And the teams, trained in search and rescue by international conflict-resolution organisation ARK, have saved 10,221 lives since June 2013.

A former firefighter, Zikra defected from the regime. He recalls rescuing an elderly woman in Idlib after government forces bombed and destroyed her home. “We weren’t sure if anyone was there so we looked around and around,” he says. “Suddenly we heard her voice. We managed to take her out alive. It was so good. The hope in her eyes, she was very old, but it was incredible.”
As well as rescuing people, civil defenders work for their communities in creative ways such as producing a home safety manual that contains a section on chemical weapons along with ideas for games to help children spot unexploded bombs.
Even in war, all life is equal for the emergency responders. Hamade and Zikra do not care for politics and say that they will help anyone. In October, volunteers in Aleppo rescued a regime soldier after five hours of digging.
The two work in harrowing conditions and are aware that they could be killed at any time, and yet – perhaps because of this – they have a passion for life. “Meeting these guys for training I am amazed that after all this time they make fun and they play games,” says ARK’s media support officer. “They like life; they just want to live.”"

Account of an aid worker: ‘We showed people they were not alone’ ","One year ago, one of the largest typhoons ever recorded struck the Philippines. Niamh Coleman – then a newly qualified aid worker – was among the hundreds that scrambled to help relief efforts
In July 2013, Niamh Coleman took part in a training course for humanitarian aid workers, preparing them for the challenging role of helping people in the immediate aftermath of major disasters such as earthquakes, typhoons and tsunamis.
“I work as a bookkeeper, but I always wanted to give a bit back. I wanted to do something that had more of a purpose,” said Niamh.
Over the next few months Niamh attended more training courses, improving her skills at first aid, learning to use handheld radios, build improvised shelters and purify drinking water. She took part in exercises simulating some of the problems that aid workers have to be ready to face when helping refugees in dangerous environments.
But simulation quickly became reality. Only a few days after she completed her third course, on 8 November 2013, one of the largest typhoons ever recorded struck the Philippines. The wind reached speeds of nearly 200 miles an hour, ripping through buildings and rendering around four million people homeless in a matter of hours.
Within three days, Niamh was on her way to the airport to catch a flight to the Philippines. Four team members from Britain met up with volunteers from Australia and the Filipino capital of Manila, and together they carried the supplies that they would need to survive for a week. When they arrived in the affected area, they found a scene of devastation.
“Seeing people starting to pick themselves up and work together in the face of such a disaster was awe inspiring.”
“I tried to prepare myself for the worst, but no matter how prepared you think you are, you experience all kinds of emotions,” said Niamh.
“I felt so sad for the people who had experienced the loss of members of their family, but I also felt a sense of determination that we were going to make a difference – that we were going to do something to really help people. The typhoon had struck in the middle of the night, so it had been pitch black and people told me that the noise of the wind had been deafening. It must have been terrifying being in a tiny single-room house with rain coming from every direction, metal roofing sheets flying around, praying that your family would survive and waiting for the dawn to arrive.”
Niamh’s team started work at a school on the island of Leyte. In the community where they were based, the school was the most substantial building – many of the houses in the immediate vicinity had been reduced to shattered timbers and crumpled sheet metal. The first task was to clear up the vast piles of debris and fallen trees. “We fixed tarpaulins over damaged roofs and started to replace the sheet metal,” Niamh explains.
“Where it was safe to do so, we included the local children in the work that we were doing, such as creating team games that involved clearing up.”
Their work soon started to show results, and classrooms that had been repaired were quickly being used as emergency accommodation, an aid storage centre, a medical centre and a soup kitchen set up by the local Rotary Club.

“When we first arrived, many people were in shock and simply didn’t know where to begin. One of the local Rotary Club members commented that the most important thing that we achieved was not sawing up fallen trees or replacing damaged roofs – but simply being willing to travel across the world and try and help in their hour of need. We gave hope to people and showed them that they were not alone. Seeing people starting to pick themselves up and work together in the face of such a disaster was awe inspiring. We started to see big signs appear that said ‘bang on’ – that’s the local way of saying ‘take heart, don’t give up, get on with it’. After a few weeks, people taking shelter in the school started to return to their repaired houses and the schools opened for lessons again. Even though at many schools lots of classrooms had not yet been repaired, it was important for the children to get back to school and return to some sort of normality”
After four weeks of hard work, Niamh’s team flew back to the UK. “I was exhausted when I arrived home,” she said. “It was an extraordinary experience and it was great to have the opportunity to go and help. If something seems important to you, you have to go for it. With a bit of courage and determination you can achieve remarkable things.”

Campaigns round up: Autumn 2014 ","All the latest from the world of campaigning, including doctors divesting from fossil fuels, gender equality on the national curriculum and how you can help take over a national newspaper
TAKE ACTION: Stopping statelessness
A global campaign to eradicate statelessness by 2024 was launched on 15 September by the United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR). An estimated 10-12 million people worldwide are stateless and unrecognised as citizens of any country, leaving them with little or no access to services such as education and housing, and impeding their ability to move between countries. UNHCR is pushing governments to sign up to two UN conventions on statelessness: one providing rights until nationality can be obtained, and another seeking to prevent statelessness from occurring.
Get involved: Sign a petition to protect stateless people in Europe.
SUCCESS: Doctors divest
The British Medical Association (BMA) has become the first medical organisation in the world to stop investing in fossil fuels following pressure from the Fossil Free Health campaign [www.medact.org/campaign/fossil-free-health]. Members of the BMA, the representative body for UK doctors, voted to divest at their annual meeting, where they also approved a proposal to consider investing in green energy instead. The motion was put forward on the basis that climate change presents “the biggest global health threat of the 21st century.”
Get involved: Sign an existing divestment petition or start your own.
TAKE ACTION: Own the news
What would the news be like if newspapers were publicly owned? That’s what the Let’s Own the News campaign aims to find out by crowdfunding a bid for the Times and the Sunday Times. With 80% of national newspapers controlled by just five families, organisers say we have an undemocratic press. To change that, they’re calling on people to make non-binding pledges to reach a bidding target of £100m. If the bid is successful, ownership will be capped at 1% per person, and members will hold annual elections to appoint a board of directors.
Get involved: Pledge your support for the bid.
SUCCESS: Transgender law in Denmark
Until this September, Danish citizens wanting to legally change their gender on documents such as driving licences and ID cards could only do so after being diagnosed with a mental health disorder and undergoing surgical sterilisation. Those obstacles left many living with documents that didn’t match their gender identity, making explanations a constant feature of daily life. Now, following pressure from trans rights groups and a Change.org petition [www.change.org/p/tell-the-ministry-of-health-in-denmark-to-stop-forced-castration-of-transgender-people], Denmark has introduced one of the world’s most progressive transgender rights laws, allowing individuals to self-determine their legal gender simply by signing a form. Most countries still have no legal process for changing gender, and those that do almost all require surgery or a medical diagnosis.
Get involved: Support the Access All Areas campaign to raise awareness of transgender discrimination.
TAKE ACTION: Gender equality on the national curriculum
Female writers are under-represented in the UK’s national curriculum – and the problem is getting worse, according to online magazine For Books’ Sake. Recent proposals to overhaul the GCSE curriculum represented an opportunity to introduce more works by female writers, but an analysis by the magazine, which promotes and celebrates women writers, found that the new set texts would actually increase the existing gender imbalance. The proportion of set texts written by women is set to decline from 37% at present, to just 31% by 2017 if the new specifications gain accreditation and are introduced to classrooms next September.
Get involved: Sign a petition calling on exam boards in England and Wales to commit to gender equality and other forms of diversity in their GCSE specifications.
SUCCESS: Protection for US tuna stocks
To protect key bluefin tuna spawning grounds in the Gulf of Mexico, the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has implemented a new policy limiting certain types of longline fishing. Longline fishermen aiming to catch other species must now use lower-impact methods during spawning season in order to avoid inadvertently killing bluefin tuna. Conservation groups welcomed the move, which it’s hoped will lead to an increase in tuna population levels.

Peace in the Middle East: international co-operation and learning from Northern Ireland are key ","The role of the Arab league and the US, and the lessons that can be learned from the Northern Ireland peace process, are key to reaching peaceful coexistence between Israelis and Palestinians, says Vijay Mehta
The Arab League initiative for peace
The Arab Peace Initiative (API), which is an extraordinary document, would require all Arab countries to normalise relations with Israel in return for comprehensive Arab-Israel peace. The plan offers full recognition of Israel but only if it returned fully to the 4 June 1967 lines, including along the Golan Heights and in east Jerusalem. It also requires a “just solution” for Palestinian refugees, which will bring security, stability and prosperity to the region. It is also worth considering France’s proposal to have European-run border monitors between the Gaza strip and Israel, in an effort to end hostilities and encourage peace.
The role of US in brokering peace
The attempts of successive US presidents, including the present Obama administration, to bring peace are laudable but questionable. Attempts to bring peace in the region can only be genuine if the US stops funding Israel and its allies with billions of dollars worth of the latest high-tech weaponry. Israel’s military aggression against Palestinians amounts to possible war crimes and crimes against humanity. The UN and governments across the world should enforce a legally binding military embargo on Israel similar to that imposed on South Africa during apartheid.

Learning from the Northern Ireland peace process
Northern Ireland has become relatively peaceful and prosperous following the Good Friday agreement brokered in 1998. This model is being increasingly applied by political leaders to solve other conflicts around the world. Some of the lessons learned that could be applied in the Israel-Palestine conflict:
1. There should be a lasting ceasefire to end violence as all parties are fed up with 60 years of infighting.
2. Start negotiations between all parties in the conflict – including sworn enemies – in a trusted manner, for sensible solutions.
3. Agreement for a two-state solution in which Palestinian statehood is recognised and Israel’s identity and right to exist is acknowledged.
4. Agreement for equitable sharing of scarce resources, such as oil, water food, land.
5. There is a need for strong leaders to help communities develop trust and close and friendly relations without excluding any group.
6. Genuine efforts at decommissioning weapons and prisoner release.
7. Setting up an Israeli-Arab Council to settle differences instead of resolving them on the battlefield.
8. No rigid preconditions for achieving the objectives of political peace process.
9. Israel needs to adopt more humane approach towards the people of Gaza and lift the blockade and barriers. Palestinian groups should reciprocate with a ceasefire and stop all acts of violence against Israeli people."

Afghanistan’s sporting success inspires future generations ","Euphoric street parties have become an unprecedented part of normal life in Kabul following Afghanistan’s recent sporting successes in both cricket and football
On 11 September the Afghan national football team won their first ever trophy, after becoming South Asian Champions when they defeated India 2-0 in Kathmandu. Then, on 3 October, following nine wins in 14 matches, Afghanistan’s cricket team beat Kenya to finish second in the World Cricket League (WCL) and qualify for the Cricket World Cup for the first time.
In a country that has suffered decades of conflict and sporting repression, success brings a burgeoning sense of national pride and self-confidence.
“Afghans are hard-working and their talents make them winners,” says Abdul Khaliq Sarabi, who works for Humanitarian Assistance and Facilitating Organisation (HAFO) in Kabul. He believes the passion of returning refugees is behind the upsurge in success. “The young Afghans who played football in Europe made a significant difference in the level of football skill. Now they are playing with the national team and bringing in the skills they learned and the technological advancements they experienced.”
Today, developments on the ground are visible. A new astro pitch in Kabul is booked out weeks in advance. Sports stadiums rise in Panjshir Valley and the capital. Eight racially diverse football teams compete in a new Premier League. And, although money builds infrastructure, passion is the prime motivator of players, who still live on stipends.
In a country where balls are bowled or kicked on every piece of waste ground, the dedication to sport is paying dividends. National success has given the next generation inspiration for the future."

The importance of sanctuary in the modern world ","Creating a place of sanctuary for yourself doesn’t mean cutting yourself off from modern life, it means allowing yourself time and space to develop an inner calm in the face of a world in crisis
The idea of sanctuary as a sacred place of refuge is returning to our hectic, noisy world. In medieval times a sanctuary was a place for a fugitive on the run to seek safety and be immune from arrest. The word itself is derived from the old French ‘sanctuaire’, implying safety, and the Latin ‘sanctus’ meaning holy. Now, in the 21st century, we are re-establishing this idea of sanctuary in relation to nature and wildlife reserves, spiritual retreats and even with the successful City of Sanctuary movement that is building a culture of hospitality for refugees in UK cities such as Bristol, Liverpool, Sheffield and Leeds.
We can extend this idea of sanctuary into our own homes by setting aside a space where we can contemplate and be still. With the increased pressures that technology is placing on society through smartphones, email and social media, isn’t it desirable that in the future each home might include a safe haven or a dedicated corner into which we could withdraw, however briefly, from the constant electronic intrusion?
Here, we’re not talking about a retreat from the world or a disengagement from the issues of our time – there is sometimes a criticism of spiritual seekers implying they are impractical or remote. What we’re talking about is an engaged spirituality, based on a recognition that slow, quiet time spent in deep silence will help to heal the world from its obsessive materialist nature.
In the past this practice was often undertaken in withdrawal, but now we’re seeing the spread of spiritual practices in everyday lives. This is where the importance of sanctuary comes in as we try to hold an inner calm in the face of a world in crisis. Creating a physical space into which we can withdraw is helpful for this.
In that space – maybe a small corner of a room decorated with flowers, or perhaps a space outside – we can withdraw from the world of sense impressions and the world of doing, allowing ourselves instead to just be. Entering our sanctuary of silence can allow us to drop our identification with the physical body and its egocentric thought processes, linking us to something deeper. But both doing and being are mutually interdependent, and so this experience can be transformative and inspiring, producing some surprising results as we return to our daily activity."

Scottish film festival aims to inspire positive social change ","Now in its sixth year, the Take One Action film festival smashes the traditional ‘lights down, be quiet’ ethos of film-going and invites discussion and debate in a bid to inspire shared responses to global issues
“Film has this amazing ability to tell stories – stories from around the world and from communities that we wouldn’t necessarily otherwise access.” This is the ethos of Simon Bateson, artistic director and founder of the Take One Action festival, a Scottish event that uses film to inspire meaningful responses to global issues.
Now celebrating its sixth year, the festival has seen more than 20,000 people attend screenings tackling issues from food production to pacifist resistance, and from global democracy to the issue of climate refugees, since its debut in 2008.
This year’s event will unfold in venues in and around Edinburgh and Glasgow between 27 September and 12 October, and Bateson says he feels more optimistic than ever about film’s potential to create positive social change.
“A good film will use all the tools at its disposal to reawaken us intellectually, emotionally and aesthetically in a way that is hard to replicate,” he tells Positive News. “It’s also an increasingly democratic medium. You no longer need a million pounds to make a world-changing film.”
“A good film will use all the tools at its disposal to reawaken us intellectually, emotionally and aesthetically”
Bateson was working as a filmmaker and community worker with the likes of Christian Aid and VSO when he was struck by how communities in Sierra Leone were uniting to overcome problems in the wake of the country’s civil war.
“I was incredibly inspired by what was happening and I wanted to bring a bit of that fire back with me when I returned to Scotland,” he says. “More and more films were being made about inspiring social change, but they needed a platform.
“We want our audiences to feel from the word go that they are entering a different and inspiring atmosphere. It is not ‘lights down, lights off and shuffle in and out quietly’, there are talks and activities so the audience is participating even before the film has started. It’s exciting for people to come together in the same space and watch these incredible films – it’s about having conversations and making connections.”
Top five inspiring new films
Selected by Simon Bateson, artistic director, Take One Action Film Festivals
Girl Rising
With voiceover from Meryl Streep, Alicia Keyes and Liam Neeson, this spirited, colourful and moving film pairs nine ordinary girls from all corners of the globe with acclaimed writers and actors to tell how they overcame the barriers to getting an education. In 2012 Malala Yousafzai was shot by the Taliban for trying to go to school. Just like Malala, 66 million girls worldwide are currently being denied a basic education, mostly as a result of poverty and gender norms. But “change is like a song you can’t hold back” says Suma from Nepal, who escaped bonded labour to learn how to read, representing the power of difference that educating girls makes in the world.
Fire in the Blood
The inspirational and impassioned story of the activists who fought to stop Western companies and governments blocking access to HIV medicines in the developing world. In the late 90s, medicines were created to curb the impact of HIV on infected individuals, charged at £10,000 per person per year. As a result, Aids-associated deaths dropped by 84% in developed countries. But to maintain profits and supposedly fund research, the drugs companies refused to license more affordable versions, leaving millions to die in countries that couldn’t afford such high prices. Fire in the Blood narrates the remarkable true story of the global activists who laid down their lives and reputations to overturn this injustice.
We Are Wisconsin
When new laws threaten to wipe away basic workers’ rights and lock out public debate, six citizens force their way into the Wisconsin State Capitol building to launch a popular uprising that will not only challenge the lawmakers, but the soul of a nation. Of recent films capturing the tide of protest that began with Occupy Wall Street, Amie Williams’ documentary is perhaps the most shocking and inspirational.
More Than Honey
This award-winning, immersive visual symphony to honeybees and the quirky people who nurture them is a humble battle cry against a global food system that rests on unsustainable methods of pollination. With deftness of touch, and dripping in honeyed cinematography, Markus Imhoof has made the holy grail of bee films celebrating the people and the insects that could save the world.
The Human Scale
By 2050, 80% of humanity will live in urban areas. Against the predominance of the car and the office block, this visionary film asks how we can build cities in developed and developing countries that prioritise the human need for inclusion and relationships over travel and productivity."

Changing the story ","Editorial: Eventually the media’s current narrative for society will become obsolete. For 20 years now, Positive News has been building a new one
Like all water travels to converge at the sea, all words flow into stories. Our conversations, songs, TV programmes, advertising and journalism all form the stories that create our shared sense of reality.
So what’s the story with mindfulness? Why is the practice of being fully present and aware becoming so popular?
Perhaps one reason is that “people are waking up,” as the woman who founded Positive News 20 years ago, Shauna Crockett-Burrows, liked to put it. Beneath the narrative of the status quo, a large-scale shift is occurring in people’s values. Two decades ago, this publication began reporting the manifestations of this.
Eventually society’s current narrative will become obsolete. You’re looking at a new one. It is one where our country is – despite some appearances – becoming more peaceful and tolerant, where local economies are being reinvented, where innovations are benefiting people’s health. It’s a world where a president gives 90% of his salary to charity, where citizens are redesigning their nation to be sustainable for generations to come, and where people are giving their time and energy to support those in conflict zones.
This is not the only version of reality, and the difficulties faced by many are severe. But do you recognise strands of these positive stories in your own life? Do you feel that shift within yourself?
If we want a world free of violence, then we need a world where individually, we are at peace. How do we make our lives an embodiment of peace? We need stories of peace that we can all become part of.
People regularly tell me that they avoid the mainstream news now because it is so negative. It is only a matter of time before the media has to change; before the story changes.
In this, Positive News’ 20th year, we’ve launched a reader survey giving you a chance not only to win some great prizes, but to help shape the future of this publication. It’s your opportunity to create the next chapter of Positive News’ story, and to help us bring that vision of a better future to the wider world. I look forward to hearing your views."

Young people called upon to boost Syrian aid effort ","Small UK charities join forces to engage young people in raising awareness and providing help for Syria
A coalition of UK charities is calling on Britain’s young people to provide a “tsunami” of humanitarian aid for Syria.
Aiming to harness their online networking connections, as well as their passion, the new umbrella organisation, Humanitarian Group for Syria, believes young people are key to escalating the level of support being given to the Syrian people.
Through its campaign, Help for Syria, the group is urging students to raise awareness, donate money or volunteer their time.
Basil Hatahet, chair of Humanitarian Group for Syria, called for young people to “unleash a tsunami of humanitarian relief for Syria.”
Launched at the University of London on 29 May 2013, the campaign is being promoted through a YouTube video and a website that includes listings of local projects that people can get involved with, such as helping pack supplies to be sent to Syrian refugees.
A roadshow will also be taking place, screening films and holding discussions at universities and colleges across the country in June.
Bushra Al-akraa, 21, a volunteer with the charity Hand in Hand for Syria, told Positive News: “I cannot stand by and watch people in Syria suffer. I try and help out in as many charity events as possible and I have visited refugee camps in Turkey.”
She said that social networks are an important tool because they “bring news from activists working on the ground,” and are also vital for fundraising as they allow charities to update their followers.
“UK charities have worked hard on organising convoys to Syria of ambulances filled with medical supplies. Feedback has been given of where these supplies were used,” she said.
According to United Nations data, the Syrian conflict has to date resulted in 80,000 deaths, 4 million internally displaced people and 1.5 million refugees. While around $1.5bn (£1bn) in aid has been pledged by the international community, the UN estimates that only 20% of funds have been released.
Speaking to the Security Council in New York in April, the UN humanitarian chief, Valerie Amos, warned of a “point of no return.”
“The situation in Syria is a humanitarian catastrophe with ordinary people paying the price for the failure to end the conflict,” she said.
Humanitarian Group for Syria includes three UK-based charities, which provide food, clothing, medicine and on-the-ground humanitarian assistance for Syrian civilians: Hand in Hand for Syria, Syria Relief and Human Care Syria. The group is calling for other charities to join them.
The Charity Commission is backing the campaign in an effort to boost support for British charities and avoid funding being directed towards “illegitimate” organisations."

‘No more’, say Indian communities fighting violence against women ","Last year’s brutal attack against a young woman in Delhi caused a worldwide outcry, igniting calls for changes in women’s rights. Lorenza Bacino examines what progress is being made in India, and the obstacles it faces
It’s a warm, balmy evening much like any other in the bustling Indian capital of Delhi. The streets are alive with the smells of sizzling food and the shouts of traders selling their wares. People are getting on with their business as they always have.
But a subtle change is underway across India, in the wake of the brutal gang rape of a young woman on a bus in December last year.
“Women are holding their chins up a little more defiantly, as if to say ‘don’t mess with me’,” says Suneeta Dhar, director of Jagori, a Delhi-based NGO working on gender equality and women’s rights.
Journalist and commentator Chhavi Sachdev, who lives in Mumbai, agrees. “There’s definitely a seething defiance close to the surface. Women seem less fearful of taking on harassment and are more likely to counter whistles and leers with a verbal rebuke.”
Sachdev spent 12 years in the United States before returning to Delhi. She then chose to leave the capital and moved to Mumbai (formerly Bombay) because, as a single woman living alone, she says it felt safer.
“The perception is that Bombay is safer. If you feel it, it perpetuates itself,” she explains. “Bombay’s a bit like New York in that it’s a city of immigrants. It’s anonymous and non-judgmental, which is why I love it. Delhi is more patriarchal as a society and more family-oriented, and from my experience, men tend to be more chauvinistic.”
“Women are holding their chins up a little more defiantly, as if to say ‘don’t mess with me’.”
Her comments reflect what’s happening in the northern Indian city of Lucknow, where a group of young women who call themselves the Red Brigade have decided that verbal rebukes are simply not enough. Aged between 11 and 25 and dressed in red and black (red for danger and black for protest), their number has swollen from a mere 15 to well over 100 in recent months. If the police don’t act on reports of harassment, they do. Trained in martial arts, they use their fists as a warning to any would-be attacker, many of whom slink off, without a scene, to contemplate this brave new stance.
India is home to a strong tradition in women’s rights groups and has been for decades. Their struggles have led to gradual social change and some improvements for women, including dowry law, health provision and work rights, but the public outcry following the attack in December 2012 has given activists a renewed momentum.
Jagori’s Suneeta Dhar says: “This is the first time so many people have connected to the issue and it’s this that has taken it to the deeper level of transparency and accountability.”
Chhavi Sachdev explains why women are feeling they can speak out more now: “I think a lot of women have come forward in solidarity and started to recognise that being molested doesn’t have to be part of their life, nor is it something they have to shoulder silently. I think as a society, here, as in most places, the shame and blame fall on the victim and I believe the sheer outpouring of public discourse – about women, by women – may help remove that stigma.
“On Twitter and online I’ve seen women find the courage to speak up and say they too were abused or molested and that the shame is the perpetrator’s, not theirs! I think that – just that – is such a huge step forward.”
“As a society the shame and blame fall on the victim and I believe the sheer outpouring of public discourse – about women, by women – may help remove that stigma”
Although the protests were spearheaded by women’s groups and students, Satish Singh, a founding member of the Delhi-based Forum to Engage Men, says the fact that men have joined the ranks for the first time has given the issue of violence against women a new dimension.
“This has been a very positive thing for the movement,” says Singh. “The men who stood for equality and believed in human rights got a space and an opportunity to be heard. Men have to learn the role of caring and participate more on this front. Only then can they live better as human beings, rather than objectifying women as something that they have to control.”
But despite the renewed momentum, incidences of rape and harassment continue unabated. It is estimated that on average there are two rapes an hour in Delhi, but in 2012 only around 600 rapes were reported. The conviction rate does the issue even less justice.
“But,” says Singh, “the public outcry is evident in the fact that these are continuously being reported in the media and the process of getting justice has become speedier.”
This outcry has spilled out onto the world stage, predominantly igniting calls for change in how violence against women is dealt with. The UN Women pilot scheme, titled the Safe Cities Global Initiative, which began in five cities (Delhi, Cairo in Egypt, Kigali in Rwanda, Quito in Ecuador and Port Moresby in Papua New Guinea) has now spread to more than 20 cities and continues to grow. Each city is taking practical steps to help keep women safe, including basic measures such as improving street lighting and building design. It also includes training police to be more sensitive in how they deal with reports of rape, and employing more women as police officers. UN Women is also partnering with Microsoft to use mobile technology to stop sexual harassment and violence in public spaces.
Still, change does not come as quickly as many would like. Bangladeshi lawyer and human rights activist Khaleda Khatoon explains why progress remains slow in India, and indeed in countries worldwide.
“Bangladesh has a new law against violence against women, which is supposed to protect them, but the main obstruction is the implementation of the law. The reason behind this is lack of good governance in all the layers of governmental hierarchy.
“Let’s raise our voices against such violence and let’s ask ourselves how we, in our daily actions, in our thoughts, contribute to this, rather than assume that the solution lies with someone else”
“Rape takes place everywhere in the world, in poor and rich nations, and I think the same applies to Bangladesh. The difference is that the developed nations have a stronger judiciary system and our system is weak. Another thing is that when a woman is raped, the attitude is that she must have invited it in some way. This is the attitude of a legal system which prejudices justice.”
Urvashi Butalia, a writer from Delhi, goes further. “It is important to raise our collective voice against rape. But rape is not something that occurs by itself. It’s part of the continuing and embedded violence in society that targets women on a daily basis. Let’s raise our voices against such violence and let’s ask ourselves how we, in our daily actions, in our thoughts, contribute to this, rather than assume that the solution lies with someone else.”
And, as Satish Singh points out, it’s society as a whole that needs to come together to make a real and committed difference.
“This whole mobilisation has created a positive atmosphere where men have become more open to listening and are arguing less to justify gender-based violence. If more and more men continue to remain connected and come out on the streets to speak against violence against women, it will help in creating a violence-free world for women, and for all.”
Here in the UK, figures released by the Crown Prosecution Service reveal rape prosecutions are up from 58% in 2007/8 to 63% for 2012/13. That’s the highest on record and would suggest some progress is being made.
And back in March, foreign secretary William Hague teamed up with UN Refugee Agency special envoy, Angelina Jolie, to highlight the issue of warzone rape. They visited the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and Rwanda, where rape is frequently used as a weapon of war. Angelina Jolie said at the time: “We want to persuade governments around the world to give this issue the attention it deserves.”
But despite these efforts, Lena Slachmuijlder, vice president of programmes for the conflict resolution organisation Search for Common Ground, says: “The DRC remains the worst place in the world to be a woman, with rape by armed groups, soldiers and civilians posing a real threat to women every day. This phenomenon is now societal, and needs more focus on the way in which men and women engage with each other. It’s only when men become partners with women in preventing rape that we’ll be able to envision an end to rape in the DRC.”
Elsewhere in Africa, in the country of Morocco, plans are underway to amend a law that allows rapists to avoid prosecution if they marry their victim. Khadija Ryadi, president of the Moroccan Association for Human Rights, says this is only a first step, as it doesn’t recognise conjugal rape, which accounts for 50% of attacks against women. However, it’s a start.
Change is happening, albeit slowly. It could take a long time to make a dent in the injustice that women face all over the world, every day. However, the horrific events that transpired on that fateful December day in Delhi may well serve as a catalyst for faster progress."

Good Business: Social innovators at Oxford Jam ","Good Business is a column hosted by Anna Levy from HUB Islington, an incubation space for socially driven entrepreneurs. Each month she catches up with the people leading change
This month, Anna talks to three social innovators from Oxford Jam, the Skoll World Forum’s unofficial fringe ‘unconference’. Here, the traditional conference format is turned on its head with the speakers paying for the privilege to take part and all tickets offered for free to delegates.
Lucinda Hardwick, Remedy Partners
Anna: Hi Lucinda, tell me a little about what you do
Lucinda: A couple of years ago, I set up a social enterprise called Remedy Partners that supports public services to work with people who’ve survived gross human rights abuses such as torture, trafficking and rape.
I came up with the idea in a job at a torture treatment centre for refugees and asylum seekers, where I saw that there was a real need for specialised training for the professionals who worked directly with survivors. Our work was getting cut back and I thought the service was still needed, but it could be done in a better way.
Studies show that there’s an average of 21 people in every inner city GP surgery who’re survivors of torture, and so there’s a high chance if you’re working in the health and social care services that you’re working with one. If you were a doctor or a nurse, and someone said that they were a victim of torture, would you know how to respond?
Why social enterprise?
Well, what we do is bridge the gap. The charities we partner with are focused on working directly with clients. What we do is aim at the providers (doctors, nurses, prison workers, etc) so that if they spot someone who they think could be a survivor of torture or trafficking, they know who to come to for advice.
I think social enterprise is better placed to provide that intermediary role, especially as we’re not reliant on funding.
How’s Oxford Jam been for you?
Oxford Jam was amazing. I enjoyed being around so many positive, excitable and thoroughly decent people. I got three concrete things out of the conference: a sound piece of advice from an UnLtd mentor, a very interesting new angle on my business and a new volunteer.
Dee Kyne, Pathfinder Developments CIC
Hi Dee, what do you do?
I’m CEO of Pathfinder Developments CIC and Pathfinder India. We deliver primary healthcare in marginalised communities.
Why social enterprise?
The reason I moved into social enterprise is that I’ve worked in the public sector and I’ve run my own charity, and I feel that the imperative in this world is to do good business – and that’s my mechanism.
Charities get politically drawn. If the paymaster makes you jump, you jump. If you’re a business that’s multi-funded and most of your profit is reinvested, you may have funders but they aren’t your sole income. Business for business sake? Well that’s good, but for me there’s more in the world than that.
What drives you?
My personal imperative is to shift social structure so that it’s more orientated around society and quality of life. So if I see someone living in India at the bottom of a garden under a tarpaulin and I hear about children starving, then I know something needs to be done. I’m a citizen of the world who feels that until things are a little more stable and fairly balanced, there’s stuff for me to do socially.
How’s Oxford Jam been for you?
Being at Oxford Jam is a little bit of soul food, filling up the well and knowing you’re not alone. Here you meet new friends and collaborators and there’s a willingness to help each other.
Ben Keene, Tribewanted
Hi Ben, what do you do?
I’ve launched a social enterprise called Tribewanted. We’re on a mission to build a global network of eco-retreats and sustainable communities connected to a group of crowdfunders. So hopefully we’ll be the first crowdfunding network in the world that can also be a holiday when you want it!
What drives you?
There are two key issues we’re tackling. Firstly, how can we scale social enterprise in tourism? But the one I think that’s really interesting for us is how you can make the most out of someone’s holiday to inspire behavioural change when they come home. How you flick the switch through what, on the surface, is just a responsible holiday. It’s not volunteering, but how do you change someone’s perspective on the world in three or four days?
How’s Oxford Jam been for you?
I’ve been meaning to come here for five years and I should have come earlier, as it’s fantastic. What’s refreshing, and what I’m pleasantly surprised about, is there’s lots of talk about scaling ideas. There’s a lot more acceptance now that there’s a myriad of different ways of delivering social impact in the world, but what really matters is scaling it. And we’re all in a hurry to do that!"

Development policy should be people-centred, says report ","A new report calls for people affected by international development programmes to be listened to more closely, with their wellbeing given more emphasis
Development policy should place more emphasis on measuring peoples’ wellbeing rather than using economic growth to evaluate success, according to a new report.
Currently, most philanthropic and governmental organisations measure the impact of their programmes using economic indicators such as a country’s GDP or the dollar-a-day income yardstick. The report calls for a more people-centred approach, where issues such as dignity and quality of life are given due weight.
The report has emerged from the Bellagio Initiative – a series of widespread discussions between policymakers, academics, opinion leaders, social entrepreneurs, activists, donors and practitioners from over 30 countries. The report was commissioned by the Rockefeller Foundation and supported by Institute of Development Studies and Resource Alliance.
The Bellagio Initiative has led six months of discussions focused on how philanthropic and development agencies can promote wellbeing and tackle the many and complex development challenges of the 21st century.
Voices rarely heard in policy debates, including refugees and indigenous representatives, were invited to participate in the discussions.
One of the initiative’s major observations was the need for building greater interconnectedness between those forming policy and those affected by policy. The report stated there is a disconnect between “development organisations and the people they are notionally working for; a gulf between governments and citizens,” and “gulfs between different development organisations [that are] working for the same outcome.”
The report suggests a shake-up in traditional thinking and proposes a new development ‘eco-system’ linking policy makers with those on the ground, as well as valuing wellbeing.
Francesca de Gasparis, European director of the Greenbelt Movement said: “We greatly welcome this initiative that breaks through the barriers in development that have prevented real change from happening.
“The Green Belt Movement has worked with rural women and their communities for over 35 years, using principles such as listening to people and instilling values to create healthy lives and ecosystems.”
Wellbeing measurements are not a new idea, countries such as Bhutan, Bolivia, Canada, Australia, France and the UK have already started to implement methods to capture this kind of data. What is new however, is the movement to embed this change of thinking in a new framework of policy and practice in the field of international development.
The publication of the Bellagio Initiative report suggests that policy makers are waking up to the limitations of economic measurements and are developing more inclusive thinking aimed at responding to peoples’ values and real needs."

Is this a media revolution? ","Transformational Media Summit report: Are we seeing a positive news revolution in specialist and mainstream media?
I was 14 when I did my work experience at a local newspaper. I was into green issues, equal rights and writing and was excited that I might be able to combine them. My first day was a ‘quiet news day’. There was a joke about the most exciting times at a local paper being when a murder happened. I felt deflated and also intrigued about that mindset.
Journalists are taught to enjoy a bit of digging in order to uncover the truth and wrongdoing, and if you expose some dirt, you’re a hero. I too believe that’s the job of journalists, but, like a growing movement of people in the media – most famously Martyn Lewis, the former BBC news journalist – I also believe that real journalism should reflect the real world, bad and good. However, a lot of journalists and editors still believe that bad news sells and that a ‘good story’ is a cat being rescued from a tree, which involves little skill to report and doesn’t make you a hero.
There’s never been much of a school of thought which goes deeper and encourages journalists to find stories which show interesting trends and positive changes around the world that could have an impact on humanity and challenge the bad guys. These stories do get covered sometimes, but there are lots out there that don’t. Instead we have reams of irrelevant and miserable stuff about people dying in accidents.
However, as you have probably seen from the Positive News pages in recent weeks, and as you might well have sensed yourself through seeking out more positive news options – there is an uprising from some people in the media who want to do things differently. While Positive News has been around for decades, we’re now seeing mainstream publications responding to their readers’ desire for stories which show humanity in a more positive, inspiring light.
Mainstream media takes note
In the last year, we’ve seen the Metro and the LA Times introduce good news feeds. Positive News has also spawned sister papers in a number of countries including Hong Kong and the US, and there’s the Huffington Post which has a big focus on news that covers positive happenings, plus many more. Additionally, this summer the Big Issue launched a new website where the aspiring journalists among its sellers can write and post stories which show solutions to the problems in our society.
As of last week, the movement has pushed further ahead again. Around 60 people from all areas of the industry got together for what is believed to be the first ever Transformational Media Summit, produced by the company Ideal Media.
Media with a deeper consciousness
There was a huge energy at the two-day event, held at Sadler’s Wells in London. We discussed how we could use newspapers, the internet, broadcasting, music, films and all sorts of other mediums for positive change. Underpinning it all was an exploration of how the media could be more conscious in the spiritual sense, so that its stories would better reflect the human spirit.
“There is a momentum going. There will come a point when the tide becomes overwhelming” – Martyn Lewis
Top Hollywood scriptwriting consultant Dara Marks spoke captivatingly about truly understanding the human story and how we could bring its spirit to life. Martyn Lewis, who was once threatened with being sacked from the BBC for speaking about wanting to see more positive news stories, said that journalists often built a “cocoon around themselves to remain detached”, but that he believed they “couldn’t explain the world unless they care about it.”
BBC World Affairs producer and landmine survivor Stuart Hughes said his accident had been the catalyst for him becoming a more conscious producer who really cares about the people he is featuring.
BBC Trust producing life-changing radio in Afghanistan
We heard from those who are using media in the most profound ways to change negative situations around the world. A talk by the deeply warm Felicity Finch, who plays Ruth Archer in Radio 4’s The Archers, stood out for me. She spoke about how the 60-year-old soap originally had a mission to educate people on farming issues in Britain, and in particular, to encourage food production after the second world war.
But even more fascinating was the fact that The Archers has spawned radio soaps in Afghanistan and Rwanda, which are listened to by the vast majority of the public and appear to be doing astoundingly well in changing mindsets in these countries. The Afghanistan radio soap New Home New Life, supported by BBC Media Action (previously BBC World Service Trust), tackles a range of social issues and has been running for 17 years. It is listened to by 80% of the population, according to Finch, who is a trainer on the programme.
In 2004, the then-UN Secretary Kofi Annan praised New Home New Life, saying it was “a perfect illustration of how the media can use drama and entertainment to advance the cause of peace and development.” In particular he commended the programme’s role in raising awareness of landmines, the return of refugees, and immunisation.
A 1997 study commissioned by the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs found that listeners were half as likely to be injured as non-listeners post-1994, and concluded that a rapid decrease in landmine incidents in the country could only be down to information broadcast through New Home New Life.
Finch, who also makes features and documentaries for Radio 4, has travelled to places including Rwanda, Peshawar, Albania and Cambodia to examine how radio drama can be used to communicate vital information. She has many heartwarming stories and explained how an older man in Afghanistan was overheard telling younger men to put their weapons down and talk about their differences “like they do on New Home New Life” – and they listened.
Deep documentary power
It was also brilliant to hear from the directors of the BRITDOC Foundation (part funded by Channel 4), Beadie Finzi and Maxyne Franklin, about the way they’ve seen documentary film-makers focus more heavily on creating cultural and legislative change over the last decade.
From the film Never too Old for Gold
They talked specifically about the BRITDOC film on sustainable fishing called End of the Line, which saw sustainable fish sales in restaurants and supermarkets rise substantially. They were particularly proud that Whiskas cat food also started using ‘marine-friendly’ approved fish after the film came out in 2010.
This year, they brought out a tender documentary about the over-80s world ping-pong championships called Never Too Old for Gold. It’s a fascinating and insightful backdrop to a campaign for elder justice and intergenerational respect. The campaign has encouraged care homes to put ping-pong tables on site, and the film is being shown in schools to encourage ping-pong competitions between older and younger people.
Finzi and Franklin spoke about ping-pong being good for mental agility and even for reversing symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease. They are now working on getting the film in front of carers to address the issue of “lack of respect in the NHS”.
Creating balance by giving a voice to those without one
“Journalists often build a cocoon around themselves to remain detached, but you can’t explain the world unless you care about it”- Martyn Lewis
Other speakers talked about putting microphones, keyboards, pens, video cameras and other media in front of people who needed a voice, so that their perspective could receive an airing. Greg Barrow, who works at the World Food Programme (WFP), talked about giving a small video camera to a 12-year-old girl called Molly who lives in the slums of Nairobi and receives free school meals. Her films received much attention through the WFP’s social media pages.
Julie Mollins, communities editor at the Thomson Reuters Foundation’s humanitarian news websites AlertNet and TrustLaw, spoke about giving a voice to people in crisis zones – through the websites and Twitter feeds – so that the world can see a truer picture of what is going on.
Leon Stuparich, an independent film-maker, made the point that showing the public’s appetite for positive stories and art through social media can influence the mainstream media. His film Road to Peace – about the Dalai Lama – received little interest until he showed the film for free online and received a wealth of interest on Facebook. The film was subsequently taken on by several distributors.
The public’s appetite
It was clear from the public mood during the Olympics that there really is an appetite for uplifting stories. One speaker said that at the start of the Olympics, the BBC was looking for stories which exposed problems around the Games, but quickly changed tack to looking for more upbeat ones.
Catherine Gyldensted, a Danish political journalist who spoke on the second day of the event (28 September), has recently completed a masters in Applied Positive Psychology.
She believes journalism needs new heroes – not just those that expose wrongdoing, but also those who shine a light on people doing the right thing. Danish media is open to news which shows agenda-changing positive stories, she said.
There was a lot of talk about the prevailing conception in mainstream media that bad news sells. Editors want grubby stories and while journalists might not always want to do them, they feel pressurised.
Good news does sell
But Gilles Vanderpooten, founder of Reporters d’Espoirs, blew this theory out of the water. The founder of the French collective has produced positive news supplements for mainstream newspapers in France. He said their studies show that the audience for the papers grows by 5-20% when a supplement is included and the papers usually bring in around three new pages of adverts when including such supplements.
“It does feel as though the revolution is getting underway. Many of us in the room sensed this”
This, along with the LA Times good news feed, Metro’s good news pages and the wealth of other evidence about the desire for positive news, has surely got to make the industry sit up and take notice a little more. We want publications and bulletins not to publish these stories separately at the back of their pages, and also stop giving space and airtime to irrelevant, negative, depressing stories too.
It does feel as though the revolution is getting underway. Many of us in the room sensed this: “There is a momentum going,” said Martyn Lewis.
While the BBC had once threatened to fire him if he spoke publicly about wanting to see more good news stories, Martyn Lewis said he’d seen moves by mainstream media professionals, such as Guardian editor Alan Rusbridger, to question the current news agenda: “There will come a point when the tide becomes overwhelming,” Lewis said.
Finally, to get to the roots of changing the media for good, we discussed encouraging journalism students and training establishments to teach ‘solutions-focused’ journalism. The Guardian has just announced the introduction of its own journalism training course – wouldn’t it be great to see some modules cover solutions-based journalism?
Reporters d’Espoirs has introduced an award for journalists who seek to show solutions to problems. We definitely need something similar in the UK to send out a clear message that journalism which tells the truth and seeks to show humanity in a good light is something to be praised.

Taking sport the extra mile ","The role of sport in creating positive social change has been celebrated at a prestigious award ceremony in London
As part of a summit held from 23-25 July, the 2012 Beyond Sport awards were presented by figures including David Beckham and Jamie Oliver, to individuals who have used sport to promote community cohesion, protect the environment and lessen the impact of conflict.
Launching the awards, David Beckham and Muhammad Ali presented the first ever Generation Ali Beyond Sport award, in celebration of a young person who has used sport to inspire and demonstrate leadership.
The award was given to teenager Matiullah Haidar who is now living in the UK after losing his family during the Afghanistan conflict. He fled the country aged 14 and arrived in the UK without knowing any English. Haidar now coaches aspiring cricketers and teaches English to other refugees through a programme called Cricket 4 Change.
“The refugee cricket project we run helps people forget what they’ve suffered back home,” said Haidar. “Sport brings communities together and changes lives. It doesn’t need a language, it doesn’t need a religion, that’s why it is so important to me.”
Nominees for the awards, spanning nine categories, were chosen from a shortlist of more than 300 entries from 135 countries. The winners were selected by a panel of Beyond Sport ambassadors, which included athletes Kelly Holmes and Michael Johnson.
The awards are a chance to recognise projects supported by the organisation Beyond Sport, which since forming in 2009 has provided more than £2.5m in support to more than 70 organisations worldwide.
The award for Best New Project, which was presented by Tony Blair, went to Goals Haiti, an organisation using sport to engage young people in education and community work.
Mr Blair said: “Sport can make people feel they’re worth something. Millions of kids don’t get that opportunity and providing that has got to be our aim.”
Other prizes included the Sport for Health award, won by WASH United, which uses sporting role models to promote safe drinking water; the Sport for Conflict Resolution award, given to AMANDLA Edu-Football for combating youth violence in the slums of South Africa; and the Sport for the Environment award, which went to NRDC Sports Greening Project, which works to reduce the environmental impact of professional sport.
The final award presented was the Innovation Through Sport award, which was claimed by Skateistan, an NGO in Afghanistan using skateboarding as a tool to empower disadvantaged children.
As well as the awards, panels discussed a variety of issues including how sport can tackle social exclusion and how attitudes can be changed through sport.
Jamie Oliver closed his panel discussion by talking about the potential for sport to inspire the next generation. “Kids look up to sport so much and it has so much potential to do good in our communities,” he said. “Sports institutions have the power to reach so many people.”"

Clowns spark laughter amid crises ","Red-nosed performers are bringing laughter, joy and theatrical mayhem to children living in refugee camps, orphanages and conflict zones
After the 2010 earthquake in Haiti destroyed much of Port-au-Prince, child survivors were so traumatised by the collapse of buildings that they were afraid to go inside. Medical and food aid sent by aid agencies met their immediate physical needs but failed to address this mental trauma.
International clowning group Clowns Without Borders (CWB) saw this as an ideal opportunity to help. Clowns were sent to Haiti to help children – through their juggling, magic tricks, handstands, practical jokes and lots of falling over – to rediscover playfulness, confront their fears and move beyond their trauma.
“We allow children to be children,” says Dianna Hahn, volunteer director at CWB USA. “The clowns came up with this incredible rhyming chant in Creole that said we can go back inside and it will be okay,” she explains.
Children learn mostly through trial and error and play. We really try to give them that opportunity to explore the world through a sense of creativity and imagination
Since the earthquake, the clowns have performed to over 50,000 children and young people in Haiti and have worked with child support agency Terre des Hommes to provide trauma relief training for community leaders.
CWB was founded in 1993 when Tortell Poltrona, a professional clown from Spain, was invited to perform at a refugee camp in Croatia. Over 700 children attended the performance, convincing Tortell of the need for clowns in crisis situations.
The organisation has grown from there, and today clowns from nine countries – including Germany, Ireland and South Africa – volunteer with CWB worldwide, putting on hundreds of performances every year.
In South Africa, Lesotho, and Swaziland, clowns perform to children in rural and township communities. Many of these children have lost friends and family members to Africa’s sub-Saharan HIV/Aids epidemic, or are themselves HIV positive.
“Children learn mostly through trial and error and play,” says Jamie Lachmann, director of CWB South Africa. “We really try to give them that opportunity to explore the world through a sense of creativity and imagination.”
Jamie believes that through helping children who have suffered trauma to embrace play and rediscover their imagination, clowns inspire children to discover their potential as human beings.
“The more you give children the invitation to be creative, the more they can see that there might be more to their lives than what they have right now,” he says. “They can start to dream, to see beyond and to start doing things in the present moment that might change their lives in the future. This is important with any children in any society, but it’s even more important when you’re working with kids affected by trauma.”
To give their work a long-term impact, CWB South Africa has developed projects focused on improving the relationship between children and their primary caregivers. Clown-led workshops featuring dance, drama, storytelling and African song strengthen the bonds between children and their guardians. Clowns then train members of the local community to continue this relationship-building and healing work.
Jamie has also taken his clowning antics to Lebanon, Israel and Palestine, training clowns and circus artists in these countries to use circus arts and play as a tool for peacemaking and to build bridges of understanding across cultures. He believes that play and wonder have the power to connect people, and to help former enemies see one another as human beings.
“Our work is about awakening into a sense of playfulness and joy,” he says. “I remember in one workshop, a Palestinian women leading an Israeli man around a garden, giving him things to smell, or feel, or things to touch, encouraging him to listen to the birds singing. It was beautiful.”
As well as empowering children to rediscover play, CWB are often asked by local community leaders to address serious issues in their performance.
“Clowns by their nature address uncomfortable situations and uncomfortable topics,” explains Dianna. “We see this as part of our role, and we’re often asked to address death, grieving, disease, sanitation, and environmental issues.”
Like everything clowns do, taking their performances into conflict zones and crisis areas is unconventional. Yet it interrupts cycles of violence and trauma, allowing communities to come together in a positive way that they will remember.
“The thing about clowning is that once you feel it and once you experience it, it’s in you, you can’t forget it,” says Dianna. “It’s a very intimate experience. Seeing clowns perform changes you. Whatever is released in your body when you laugh, it changes you, and you remember feeling that.”"

Bristol becomes a City of Sanctuary ","Bristol joins network of UK towns and cities showing a welcoming attitude to refugees
More than 700 people and 120 organisations pledged their support this summer for Bristol to become a City of Sanctuary. The area is the latest to have the status – which is designed to show a friendly attitude to asylum seekers.
On 22 June 2011, Bristol celebrated with singing, dancing and processions. Hundreds of people gathered as they watched the spectacle parade through the College Green, Bristol Cathedral and the Council House.
It was an extravagant and symbolic day with celebrations that included tea and cake in the Council House – offering a traditional English welcome. An umbrella dance and procession paraded through College Green to denote the concept of shelter.
The procession itself was created to artistically represent the journey refugees go through to find safety.
The City of Sanctuary concept was set up in October 2005 in Sheffield, which became the first area to achieve the status. The aim was to create a chain of towns and cities throughout the UK that offer safety.
The number of places with the status has grown steadily, and now includes: Bradford, Chester, Coventry, Glasgow, Hackney, Huddersfield, Hull, Ipswich, Leeds, Leicester, London, Manchester, Nottingham, Oxford, Sheffield, Swansea and Wakefield.
These towns and cities pledge to appreciate the diversity of cultures within them and to include refugees and asylum seekers in local activities. Many locals are interested in gaining an insight into the trauma that these people faced in their own countries and want to support them through difficult times.
One of the many people who were vital to Bristol achieving a City of Sanctuary status was June Burrough, the founding director of local conference venue, the Pierian Centre.
June said that local refugees had been warmed by the support. “There were about 100 refugees and asylum seekers at the launch, and they had a voice and felt heard and welcomed,” she said. “It mattered to them that the civic leaders and members of the general public all came together to make such a public statement.”
She continued: “There is widespread support for the concept of being a City of Sanctuary. Increased diversity and cultural richness are assets for Bristol. The better supported that newly arrived asylum seekers are, the quicker they can integrate, work and contribute to the local communities in which they live.”
Her colleague, Nick Thomas added: “There were about 300 or 400 people wreathed in smiles and triumphant laughter. There were flamboyant ethnic costumes alongside mayoral robes and ecclesiastical collars. It was a huge success.”
Now that Bristol has acquired the status, June said that Schools of Sanctuary is also on its way – a programme promoting positive attitudes in children, towards refugees. “We are following the Leeds programme for this, and will aim to have several Schools of Sanctuary by Refugee Week 2012.”"

Maggie Doyne Makes a Difference ","Having established a home and school for children in Nepal, 24 year-old American, Maggie Doyne is now encouraging other young people to find their own way to make a positive difference in the world
At 19, Maggie Doyne set off travelling on a gap year before starting higher education. “To say I was obsessed with getting into the perfect college would be, well, an understatement,” she recalls, yet she would not return to walk through those university gates. While volunteering on an internship programme in north-east India, she discovered a more urgent calling.
Working with Nepalese refugee children who had fled across the border during the Maoist insurgency, she wondered how bad a situation they must have been running from. Before long, she found herself in Nepal looking into the eyes of a little girl, whose job everyday as a child porter, for a dollar-a-day wage, was to go back and forth carrying 60kg bags of goods from a bus park into the villages.
Maggie’s whole world collapsed in a second as the reality of the suffering of the world’s 80 million orphaned children hit home. “I looked at her and I saw every single piece of myself,” Maggie recalls, “and I was devastated… I thought, what have we done as a human family, that our children are living this way?”
Speaking with NGOs, government officials and local people, Maggie learned that Nepal has 45,000 misplaced children: ex-child soldiers, orphans and young girls sold into sex-trafficking, all struggling to survive without a safe home, food, clothing or the chance to go to school. Maggie also discovered that in Nepal, education is not free. “That’s when I started to do the maths,” she says. “Admission fee: $5; uniform: $7 and books: $8. I decided that with very little effort, I could really make a difference.”
Maggie paid to put one girl into school and before long, one became five, which became ten… Then a vision formed in her mind; she was going to build a home for these children. Maggie put her plans for college on hold. Instead, she got on the telephone to her parents, asking them to transfer all her $5,000 savings from years of babysitting, and with this money she bought a small patch of land. Having run out of funds, she flew home in the spring of 2007. Before doing so however, she dug a foundation hole for the building.
After fundraising in her hometown, she returned to Nepal with $25,000. Within six months Maggie had built Kopila Valley Children’s Home in Surkhet, three hours north of the Indian border in mid-western Nepal. Here, a new family of 35 healthy and happy children now thrive.
Over 200 local Nepalese people took part in construction of the home, from masons to plumbers. Many local women, as well as orphaned children, helped to carry materials and work alongside the labourers, as did Maggie. “It became fun for all of us,” she remembers. “The kids and the whole village now takes ownership and feels really proud of what we built together. I wanted to be sure that it wasn’t about me – a foreigner coming in and telling these people what was best for them! I wanted to hear what the local people themselves saw as the needs in their community.”
Once built, it wasn’t long before Kopila was inundated with orphans. Fortunately, CosmoGirl magazine awarded Maggie a $20,000 prize, courtesy of Maybelline. It came as a surprise to Maggie, whose life in Nepal did not leave much opportunity to think about make-up, but she gratefully used the money to extend the home with second and third floors.
Maggie was also awarded $100,000 in 2009 by DoSomething.org – a leading organisation working with young people to create a culture of volunteerism and inspire ‘a generation of doers.’ With the prize money she was able to fulfil another dream: to build a new school.
Since opening in June 2010, the school has already secured a reputation for its success, and offers a creative learning approach, as well as training in practical skills, such as growing food, cooking and raising livestock – crucial in a country where the vast majority of people rely on subsistence farming. Made sustainably from bamboo, the building hosts over 200 children. They each receive health-care and basic medical treatment, as well as a meal – sometimes the only one they will eat that day.
Kopila has also set up their own Village Outreach Programme for other children who do not have the opportunity to go to school. “We can offer them scholarships, tutoring, and sometimes bicycles to get to school,” explains Maggie, “and we also improve schools in remote areas; making repairs and giving desks and benches.”
Maggie is now living in Nepal full-time with breaks in the US to fundraise and meet with her board of directors. As news of Kopila Valley has spread, she has also begun to speak publicly about her project. She created The BlinkNow Foundation as a separate entity to share her ideas and views with other young people.
“I believe that in the blink of an eye, we can all make a difference,” she says. “My hope is that my blog and the BlinkNow website will help keep young people connected with my story and the every day realities of the world.”
BlinkNow wants to promote work at the grassroots level in areas such as rural development, literacy and education, social justice, women’s empowerment and global sustainability. Maggie has created a guide to help others understand how to create their own organisation, on either a community or global level, with suggested reading material and special tips from her own experience.
“I have met some of the most amazing young people through my journey,” she says, “many of which have guided and supported me. After visiting schools, I’m now more certain than ever that young people do care! We really want to change things. Sometimes it’s just hard to know how to help and what to do.
“When telling my story it’s important for me to stress that this has just been my path. However, that change and service can come in different forms, even just in our daily interactions with each other.”
Maggie’s long-term dream is to create safe homes and communities for children all over the world in need of refuge. “I have come so far from that girl, with the backpack,” she says, “but now more than ever, I know that anything is possible. My heart is full and the future is exciting. There is so much still to do.”Contact: www.blinknow.org

Celebrating a Load of Rubbish ","Trashcatchers Carnival draws crowds in Tooting, helping unite community behind Transition message
The Trashcatchers Carnival, a unique summer event with floats and costumes made almost entirely from household rubbish, saw over 800 participants from schools, community groups and clubs take part. To create the extravaganza, over one million plastic bottles and shopping bags were used, half a million crisp packets, half a tonne of renewable willow, and all sorts of other materials that had been collected over a six month period.
During the last 18 months, event organisers Emergency Exit Arts, and Project Phakama UK – a youth arts group working with refugees -0 helped Transition Town Tooting make the day possible. Hindered by red tape, and with only two days to go, it looked like the event might not happen at all. The carnival is a testament to the persistence and determination of all those involved.
Fantastically-attired carnivalistas danced the route on foot and procession vehicles were fuelled by recycled vegetable oil – although many of the floats were driven by bicycle. The South London Swimming Club had a pedal-powered float with an iceberg and sea made out of plastic bags and bottles. On board were swimmers dressed to look like the colourful doors of their changing rooms at the Tooting Bec Lido – the second largest open-air fresh water swimming pool in Europe.
Among the more amusing floats were the cycle-powered living rooms, transporting some of the elders of the local community. Sitting comfortably on her recycled armchair, Jaya Patel, a born-and-bred Tooting resident, said: “The best thing about this Carnival is that it has brought the whole community together, from all sections young and old, and from all ethnic backgrounds.”
Lucy Neal, the co-chair of Transition Town Tooting, emphasised that the artists involved played a very important part in helping people conceptualise. “The role of the imagination is to create the world we want,” she said, “and ‘no’ doesn’t come into it!”
Speaking at the ‘Unleashing of Transition Town Tooting’ a few days after the Carnival, Transition Network co-founder Rob Hopkins announced: “The best people to know how to do Transition in each particular place are the people from that place. If someone had come to us two years ago and asked us how to do Transition in Tooting, we would never have said ‘well… you need to get a million plastic bags, half a million crisp packets, some shopping trolleys and march it all down the street.'”
At a half-day forum examining the impact of the Trashcatchers Carnival, it was concluded that for a community to develop and create networks, it needs to come together through activities and participation so that conversations become real connections. “Individually we may seem insignificant,” said Lucy, “but when we connect up in a community, we are very strong and can make a huge difference.”

Building a World Movement ","The president of Bolivia, Evo Morales, has announced that his country will hold a referendum of two billion people within the year, to produce a shared agenda for solutions to the current climate crisis. The statement followed the World People’s Conference on Climate Change and the Rights of Mother Earth, which took place in Cochabamba, Bolivia, in April.
The summit also proposed that rich countries should halve their greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 and do so without resorting to carbon markets or offsets. Compared with UN targets of 7 to 16 per cent, the 50 per cent reduction commitments are seen as essential to stabilise average temperature increase between 1 and 1.5 degrees celsius to ensure the survival of small island nations. It was also recommended that an international Climate Justice Tribunal be set up with the power to penalise offending countries and companies.
In a speech to the G77 at the United Nations, President Morales announced that more than 35,000 participants from 140 countries attended the event, including delegations from NGOs, unions and governments, as well as scientists and grassroots activists. He referred to those supporting its objectives as, The People’s World Movement for Mother Earth.
Destructive methods of production and consumption need to be abandoned, he observed, in favour of learning from “the example of indigenous peoples that have in all parts of the world preserved their forms of living in harmony with nature.” He emphasised that to save the Earth, all the peoples of the world must co-operate in the spirit of equality and their governments must listen.
Nnimmo Bassey, chair of Friends of the Earth International, praised the approach: “Bolivia’s positioning on environmental issues provides a beacon of hope that we encourage other governments and local authorities to follow.”
Over three days, 17 groups worked on proposals, which will be taken to the UN climate change conference in Cancun, Mexico, in November. Organisers said an inclusive, democratic approach was adopted as an alternative to the closed-door style of political decision making found at Copenhagen.
A report from the Bolivian summit, the ‘People’s Accord’, has been delivered to the UN. It proposes that respect for nature be at the heart of policy and urges developed nations to ratify the Universal Declaration of the Rights of Mother Earth – a document developed by UK lawyer, Polly Higgins.
The summit concluded that developing countries should be compensated for the impacts of carbon emissions from rich nations. Bolivia itself is threatened by extreme water shortages caused by receding glaciers, while deforestation is leading to flash floods and landslides, which can suddenly destroy villages and roads. As part of addressing these issues, President Morales announced that ten million trees will be planted in Bolivia within a year – as many as its population.
It was recommended that governments should set aside six per cent of national GDP to finance climate initiatives, and that border controls should be relaxed to accommodate an estimated 50 million climate refugees.
The delegates put people and planet before profit and stated that clean, green technologies should be shared internationally, free from intellectual property rights. In addition, they said, everyone should have the right to control their own food production.
Bolivia intends to keep the momentum initiated at the Cochabamba conference moving. President Morales said: “In the unity of the developing countries lies our potential to forge a new world in which harmony exists among human beings and with our Mother Earth.” He concluded that we have two paths: “save capitalism or save life and Mother Earth.”

7 Million Children Vote for Nelson and Graca ","Both Graca Machel and her husband, the former South African President, Nelson Mandela, have been crowned ‘Heroes’ in a vote cast by seven million children from across the world.
The ‘Decade Child Rights Hero’ is a new award established to celebrate ten years of the World’s Children’s Prize for the Rights of the Child, founded by the Swedish organisation, Children’s World.
Graca is being honoured for her work with vulnerable young people, primarily in Mozambique and for her courageous campaigning for the rights of girls. In 1994 she established the Foundation for Community Development – grassroots organisation that protects children from disease and poverty – the first of its kind in Mozambique. “We buy vaccines and make sure that children do not die from preventable illnesses,” she explained.
Graca also helps young people who are too poor to go to school. “I know what it’s like,” she said. “I was just as poor when I was little.” Thanks to her efforts, girls will soon account for half the pupils in Mozambique’s schools.
Graca’s husband, Nelson Mandela, led the fight against South Africa’s Apartheid regime, which ruled that black and white communities must live in separate areas, travel on different buses and even stand in their own queues. He was sentenced to imprisonment for treason and released after 27 years, by which time he was 72 years old. The South African government ended Apartheid in 1994.
Two decades later, Nelson Mandela remains an influential world speaker on humanitarian issues and a champion of young people’s rights. He runs his own foundation, into which he used to donate half his presidential salary. The centre looks after children who are orphaned, disabled, or whose parents are too poor to take care of them. “The Children of Africa are the most valuable treasure that the country will ever possess,” he said.
On receiving the news that they had won, Nelson and Graca announced: “We are extremely honoured … There’s nothing more precious and pure than being loved and appreciated by children. For us both, this award is very special given the place children occupy in our hearts and lives.”
The prize fund is 1.1 million Swedish Kronor. Graca and Nelson will receive half to help them continue their work – just over £43,000. The remaining half is split between twelve other candidates.
Pointing out that being recognised by children comes with great responsibility, Graca added: “While we thank you for the award, we also renew our commitment and call upon each and every individual, whether in public or private life, to do even more to provide our children with a future worth having. It is in our reach.”
The World’s Children’s Prize is awarded by an international child jury, who are experts on the rights of young people due to their own life experiences. The jury includes those who have been soldiers, slaves, refugees, street children, or who have had their rights violated in other ways.

Fruitful Success for Palestine ","From the steep terraces of Jenin to the heights of Gilboa, you hear the sound of strings and stamping feet. It’s just a murmur at first but with every beat there’s more vigour as the Dabke takes off. The leader waves his beads like olives in the breeze, and the local kids gather round. Their cousins have journeyed home, the harvest is in and the festivities begin.
For Mohammed Isa of the Anin Co-op for Olive Oil Production, there are more reasons to celebrate the harvest this year than in the past. For the first time, his oil will be sold with Fairtrade certification. This means, he will sell more of it, at a higher price, to a wider clientele – and be able to invest in next year’s production. He’s proud too, to be part of the world’s first initiative for fair trade olive oil.
In 2004, when Heather Masoud and Cathi Pawson first contacted the Fairtrade Foundation about Palestinian olive oil, they didn’t get much of a response. “It was seen as a developed country product – from Italy or Greece,” explains Heather.
The two women, who originally met through a permaculture course, had just returned from a spell as peace volunteers in the West Bank. They had been struck by the prevalence of the olive tree – there are terraces everywhere – and its central role in Palestinian culture. But they had also met olive farmers who were unable to access markets, due to restrictions on movement imposed by the Israeli occupation and were determined to do something constructive.
“It was a combination of the warmest hospitality I have ever received and the scale of the injustice,” explains Heather, who is married to a Dabke dancer from Gaza. “We met farmers who’d lost trees to Israeli settlements and whose land had been cut off by the [security] wall. You’d see this swimming pool, golf course sort of environment and then down in the villages, you’d turn the taps and there’d be no water. In a very British way, we were thinking: ‘Surely, if something is illegal you can pick it up with someone and change it…'”
They soon realised that it wasn’t quite as simple as that. But, while the politics may be frozen, perhaps trade could offer hope. So, once back in Britain, they explored options. At first, they assumed that the sort of fair trade groups who’d bought Nicaraguan coffee would also be a natural market for Palestinian olive oil. However, initial research was discouraging. “We couldn’t find anyone who was planning to import it,” Heather recalls, “so, we thought we’d give it a go.”
Today, just four years down the line, the pair are directors of Zaytoun CIC, a community interest company that takes its name from the Arabic for ‘olive’. It’s the first UK company to import olive oil and other produce from Palestine and the first in the world to win both organic and Fairtrade accreditation for it. The combined achievements helped Heather win the 2009 ‘Women in Ethical Business Award’, sponsored by Triodos Bank.
“We want this olive oil to be an education medium,” she says. “It’s a nice way to tell people about what is happening in Palestine, while they’re consuming a delicious product.”
Sympathy for the farmers’ plight helped to get Zaytoun off the ground. “We had volunteers coming in to do graphic design. One did the labels to meet food trading standards and a Turkish guy lent us warehouse space for the first import.”
Zaytoun’s opening order was for just 200 bottles. “But a word-of-mouth thing happened,” says Heather. “Those bottles just disappeared.” They began to market it more widely and six weeks later, their second order was for 5,000 bottles.
By the end of 2005, it was clear that Zaytoun had too much potential to be run solely on a part-time, voluntary basis. If they were to keep going, they had to earn a living. So in 2006, they took the plunge and launched themselves as a registered company with a co-operative structure, inspired by other well-known fair trade brands, such as Divine and Cafe Direct. Meanwhile, their suppliers were proposing a little diversification. As Heather explains: “They kept saying things like: ‘Do you know that Palestinian dates are amazing?’ Medjoul dates are grown in the Jordan valley; big, fat, really good ones.”
So, they began to buy dates, followed by soap from Nablus and prize-winning long grain couscous, hand-rolled by a women’s co-operative at Ein Al Sultan refugee camp, in Jericho.
Zaytoun now has two full-time members of staff and three that are part-time, including Taysir Arabasi, its director in Palestine. In the last financial year, they imported 80,000 litres of olive oil. This year, with their first Fairtrade-certified harvest bringing new bulk buyers onboard from The Co-operative and Equal Exchange, they’re expecting sales to grow by at least 30 per cent. “At the moment, we’re still covering costs,” says Heather, “but we are aiming to be turning a profit in about three years.”
Heather is also hopeful that they will bring in about £100,000 additional funds over the next year, as a mix of loans and grants. So far, the company has relied on initial charitable support from The Funding Network, a loan and overdraft from Triodos Bank, and a large network of volunteers and solidarity NGOs giving both their time and their custom.
Zaytoun would like to offer their producers a stake in the company, Heather says, but first: “we need to borrow some expertise … There’s so much that we’d like to do better.” There’s a lot of cross-cultural learning to be done too. Zaytoun organise exchanges, whereby European students travel to the West Bank to visit co-operatives during harvest time and Palestinian farmers come to the UK to speak at Fairtrade Fortnight events and to learn more about the market. “Fair trade sounds like a nice concept to our producers, but they want to understand why customers would be prepared to pay premiums when you can get very cheap European olive oil.”
Meeting the exacting standards of large-scale European food buyers has been a bit of a learning curve for the producers, too. They have had to grapple with everything, from correctly ventilated storage for controlling the levels of acidity and peroxide, to submitting their produce for organoleptic (taste) tests. “The farmers have really embraced all of this,” Heather says, “and they’re proud of the results.”
French olive growers council, Adolive, declared Zaytoun oil to be: “Very fine, harmonious, in terms of both fragrance and taste … with salad-like hints of green bean, broad bean [and] young walnut … with a peppery, even spicy finish.”
And, while some farmers struggle to adapt to organic methods, for Zaytoun’s producers it was simply business as usual. Most have never been able to afford fertiliser and other chemical inputs, so there was little to change. “It’s hand-picked, rain-fed agriculture, really suited to the hilly terrain,” Heather says, “and the trees take so long to bear fruit, they’re passed down from generation to generation.” Which is why the whole family comes home for the harvest.

A New Generation Shifts into Gear ","“I think we live in a really exciting moment. We have the opportunityto do fantastic things. Because we have to. How often do we see peopleflourish in such a way because there’s a need for it to happen?” ñ Emma Biermann
Thereis a shift taking place. Against the odds, climate change is beingtreated by an increasing amount of people, as something that can beturned into a positive opportunity.
This became visible whenhundreds of young adults and teenagers from across the country,converged in London this autumn for Power Shift ’09. The aim was: “Toconnect young people and inspire and equip them to organise in theirlocal communities, raising the youth voice on climate change,”explained Amy Mount, the event’s media officer.
Located at theInstitute of Education, workshops took place over four days, alongsidemotivational talks from speakers, such as Ian Katz, deputy editor ofThe Guardian, Daniel Vockins, manager of the 10:10 campaign, actor Jason Isaacs and Shilpa Shah, the founder of an interfaithcarbon-cutting scheme, The Akashi Project.
The event culminatedwith a ‘flash-mob dance’ next to the London Eye and then outsideParliament. Waves of young people suddenly appeared, seemingly out ofnowhere, to perform a co-ordinated routine. With a public display ofsolidarity and celebration, they injected a note of creativity andpassion into the climate change debate.
“Doing the dances wasamazing,” said participant, 24 year-old Rosie Sullivan. “You’ve got tohave fun together and celebrate the fact that we are alive and live ina beautiful world, right now. It’s not completely dysfunctional.”
ThePower Shift weekend was run by UKYCC ñ UK Youth Climate Coalition,which was set up by co-directors Emma Biermann and Casper ter Kuile.Emma, age 23, is concerned about the emerging impacts of climatechange, such as potential mass displacements of people. She learned ofthe effects of forced migration through her mother, a war refugee fromCambodia: “She came over as a result of conflict in 1975. She couldn’tspeak English, her medical qualifications were not recognised and shelost all her family. If we create that type of situation for many morepeople, through man-made climate change, that’s just not cool.”
Emmaattended the UN climate change negotiations in Poland last year. “Itwas the most disempowering experience I’ve ever had,” she remembers. “Politicians in their 50s and 60s were discussing inadequate targetsfor 2050, when actually, they won’t be around to see the worstconsequences of climate change. This is not acceptable, because they’renegotiating our lives.”
In response, Power Shift was set up tomobilise young people and empowerment was its foundation. “We’re themoral reminder,” said Emma. “We’re prepared, co-ordinated, have all thetechnology we need and hold a vision for a world that is going to bemuch healthier.”
The central tool put forward was the power ofstories. Based on the techniques of Marshall Ganz ñ who designed thegrassroots campaign that led Barack Obama to victory ñ workshops helpedparticipants share their ‘Stories of Self’: personal accounts of howthey came to be concerned about climate change.
“You can look atthe subject from so many angles: policy, trade agreements, energy…”says Emma, “but the ‘Story of Self’ starts from your own experience andthat’s how you engage with people.”
Diversity was vital to thePower Shift agenda. “UKYCC is centred on being inclusive,” explainsEmma. “I think that, as the defining issue of our generation, climatechange is very much over-arching. You don’t have to be a ‘greenie’ tocare, because it’s about our jobs and future income and the welfare ofour families and friends.”
Speaking to the event’s audience,Kofi Hope, founder of Black Youth Coalition Against Violence, put iteloquently: “We are all connected to one struggle; to build properrelationships between human beings and proper relationships between usand our environment.”
A strong feeling of hope arose as theweekend progressed. “Climate change is a challenge for people to seetheir potential,” stated one of the ‘Power Shifters’, Claire Prizeman.The event highlighted, that due to the urgency of the climate crisis,now is a time of tremendous possibility. As Ashok Sinha from the StopClimate Chaos Coalition told the conference: “We can be the generationthat grasps the opportunity that no generation has had before ñ tocreate a better future.”
When the four days came to an end, theUK’s new youth climate movement dispersed from the capital, energisedand confident. “I feel positive about what we can achieve in theworld,” Rosie Sullivan said. “I’m filled with this great feeling ofjoy, that we have an opportunity to make changes happen, which we’veall been waiting for.” Power Shifter, Muyiwa Olufon agreed: “In 2050, wewon’t be toast. We will survive.”

A Voice for Peace ","Emmanuel Jal: the Incredible Journey
Emmanuel Jal is an international star, rapper and a human rights activist, with three critically acclaimed albums. His unique style of hip-hop, combined with messages of peace, reconciliation and hope, has brought him to the attention of former South African President, Nelson Mandela. His music has also featured in the Oscar-nominated film Blood Diamond.
What makes Emmanuel’s achievements even more impressive is the adversity he has overcome in his life. After enduring several years as a child soldier in Sudan, he escaped the horrors and was rescued by British aid worker, Emma McCune.
Against the odds, he has survived the trauma and channels his emotions and experiences into his rhymes, as a way to ease the pain. “I believe I survived for a reason,” he sings, “to touch lives.”
His first album, Gua, meaning ‘peace’ in his native Nuer tongue, was broadcast by the BBC across Africa and earned a slot at Live 8 in 2005. In some of his lyrics, Emmanuel begs his listeners to stop the fighting in Sudan and strive for peace, while in others, he advocates education for women. There are further plans to release a new album in the coming year.
However, it is Gua Africa, a nonprofit organisation that he founded, which remains Emmanuel Jal’s biggest passion. The project began informally when he used the money earned from his music, to support and educate a small group of boys from the Kakuma refugee camp in northwestern Kenya.
Now, a registered charity, Gua Africa’s mission is to work alongside individuals, families and communities, to help them overcome the effects of war and poverty. “All our projects focus on providing an education to young adults and children,” explains Kate Gumm, the charity’s UK co-ordinator. “We feel this is the most powerful weapon in breaking the cycle of poverty and aid dependency.”
The organisation’s “Survivors of War” project supports 15 young men and two women in Kenya and Uganda, in their quest to receive an education. One former child soldier is now completing his medical studies at Kampala University and a sponsorship scheme at Kariobangi Primary School, in Nairobi, is currently supporting a further 20 children.
Another area of Emmanuel’s focus is The Emma Academy – established in memory of Emma McCune, the aid worker who rescued him. The project is working to renovate an existing primary school in the town of Leer, in Southern Sudan, which on completion, will be able to educate around 500 children.
When asked if he saw himself as a role model, Emmanuel humbly replied: “I am trying to make myself to be one. I keep watching what I do, so that other kids may watch and get inspired to be positive. I don’t count achievements; I just do things, hoping to make a difference.” His ambition is to “make more music, build more schools and to keep up the fight against evil by doing good.”
Soon to be launched, Emmanuel’s new ‘Lose to Win’ campaign, will be asking supporters to give something up each day and raise money through sponsorship. He, himself, has been fasting for the past six months, living on one meal a day. “I will continue to do so,” he states on his Facebook group, “until we have raised 300,000 US dollars.”

Nobel Prize Nominee Makes a Stand for Peace ","‘Out beyond rightdoing and wrongdoing there is a field. I’ll meet you there.’ Jalal ad-Din Muhammad Rumi
Dr Izzeldine Abuelaish is an exceptional man. A renowned Palestinian obstetrician, fluent in Arabic, Hebrew and English, he specialises in fertility and welcomes both Arab and Jewish patients. A long standing advocate of peace, he is a frequent guest on Israeli television and radio but his real mission is simple ñ to save lives, rich or poor, irrelevant of race or religion.
Dr Abuelaish grew up and still lives in a refugee camp in the Gaza Strip and was the first Palestinian doctor to be enrolled at an Israeli hospital. Determined to treat the poor and displaced, he also runs a clinic, where treatment is free.
Over the years, he has become an icon of hope and reconciliation in the Middle East, or as one of his Jewish colleagues donned him recently, a magical, secret bridge between Israelis and Palestinians.’ However, mid spring this year, the gentle family man lost three of his daughters and his niece during a military strike on his home. Just eight months later, far from voicing bitterness or seeking revenge, his faith in humanity remains unbroken. Well respected by both communities, he is now trying to propel this personal tragedy into a catalyst for change and an incitement for peace and resolution.
Through the media, Dr Abuelaish has been preaching reconciliation, asking us all to help steer our government leaders towards peace in the Middle East. ‘We must learn to change course through respect, trust and mutual dignity,’ he says. Many attending his lectures have been truly moved by his words. ‘To see such grace and presence ñ and what he’s doing with his own situation,’ said an audience member. ‘We must work on the ground everyday to support him.’
Aside from all his usual commitments, Dr Abuelaish has been working to set up a scholarship foundation for Palestinian girls, in memory of his daughters. ‘It’s time for women to lead and take the upper hand!’ he declares. Meanwhile, he is also helping to build an international conference centre in Israel’s largest hospital and has contributed greatly to the success of a Palestinian-Belgium project, offering psychological support to Gazan children.
The physician still gives medical treatment to one and all, even those that fired the shells on his home. ‘The Hippocratic Oath goes beyond the stethoscope and the syringe,’ he explains. ‘It is a solemn oath to heal the wounds of humanity.’
A Belgian state secretary has recently nominated Dr Abuelaish for the Nobel Prize, naming him a soldier of peace’. ‘He is an exemplary symbol of justice and goodwill for the whole world,’ said the Israeli Minister, Avishay Braverman, who declared the nomination a victory for humanity and vowed to support it.
Dr Abuelaish, who now plans to write a book about his life to make the case for co-existence and raise project funds, was asked by the press if he might consider relinquishing medicine to enter politics. ‘Where I find a way to change and help, that’s where I’ll be… but right now, I just want to save lives,’ he replied. ‘We treat patients equally with respect, dignity and privacy. Politicians should learn these values and norms and adopt them.’

Listen With London Leaders ","Digital radio station Passion for the Planet recently became an official broadcasting platform for the flagship programme ñ London Leaders ñ set up by the London Sustainable Development Commission.
Launched in 2007, the Leaders’ project is a pioneering scheme to catalyse the change needed to transform London into a sustainable city. It aims to empower citizens and to prove that by providing communities with powerful leadership, confidence, skills and support, a positive future can be achieved.
In the coming months, Passion for the Planet will broadcast a series of 5-minute interviews with past and present London Leaders, each drawn from a broad cross-section of society. This will allow them to showcase all their ideas and whet the appetites of the 120,000 listeners who tune in each week.
Chantal Cooke, co-founder of Passion for the Planet and a 2009 London Leader, became involved with the project be-cause its approach gives sustainability a human face. ‘Using Passion for the Planet for this programme has two benefits,’ explains Chantal. ‘Firstly, it will inspire action to change behaviour. Secondly, it demonstrates that London is really doing something great to approach this issue of sustainability. Although the city has Victorian waterways and small roads, it doesn’t mean this should hold us back. It would be great to inspire other cities, such as Manchester and Birmingham.’
Last year’s programmes have been a real success, with a range of projects, from retrofitting green roofs, publishing a community cookbook, working with London Television to promote energy efficiency and training young refugee leaders in environmental issues.

Awards from the Heart ","Humanitarian, philanthropist and author Fred Matser set up theRediscover Your Heart’ Awards to support young people in direct,inspirational action for personal and global change. After first launching in New York last year, the second set of awards were presented in London, at a ceremony in April 2009.
Individuals and groups from across the UK received awards for a diverse range of valuable projects. These included initiatives such as: a microfinance scheme for disadvantaged young people starting new ventures; the planting of a new wood by children in just one day; a project helping young people to heal crises in their own families; a refugee support programme and an organisation teaching yoga and meditation to prisoners.
One of the awardees was Blue Apple Theatre company, who offer dance and acting opportunities to young people with learning disabilities. As part of the prize-giving ceremony, the group took to the stage to perform a graceful and emotive dance for the audience.
Alongside a key speech from founder Fred Matser and the award presentations themselves, there was also an inspiring speech by Jane Goodall, United Nations Messenger of Peace. Reflecting on her lifetime’s work with chimpanzees, conservation and animal welfare, she described her perception of humanity as: ‘hearts beating shared blood around the world.’
Jane cited the disconnection between our intellect and our hearts as the reason why we, despite being the most developed species, are harming the planet. However, she praised the youthfulness of spirit’ witnessed regularly in her work with the Roots & Shoots programme ñ a network of groups of young people carrying out beneficial projects in their communities.
With earnest conviction, Jane told the audience that a renewed discovery of not only our own hearts but of the hearts that beat around us, was possible. The event certainly testified to this, creating a feeling of unity amongst all who were present. There was also a sense of promise in the young people, who are being given the opportunity to expand their lives through the awarded projects, both those running them and those benefiting.

There are over 100 brands of bottled water in the UK, at least half of those are readily available either online or at the local store. So at any one time, the average UK resident has a choice of 50 bottled waters. As well as the vast choice in brand, there is also a huge variety in price, from £59 to 7p per litre!
Excellent Development, who build sand dams for water collection in arid parts of Africa, is encouraging people to forego their bottled water for World Water Day and instead, donate the money to help supply water for life in Africa.

World Prizes for Three Extraordinary Women ","Three extraordinary brave women, who have been campaigning to create a better world for children, have each had their incredible efforts recognised by a truly deserving accolade: the World’s Children’s Prize for the Rights of the Child.
A total of 17 million students at 37,000 schools from 92 countries, participated in this event and each year the numbers grow. A staggering 6.6 million of these children voted to determine who received the 2008 Global Friends Award.
Somaly Mam from Cambodia, was selected for this prize because she has been working against all odds to liberate girls taken from their homes and forced to work against their will, as she herself was. Somaly has built three safe houses, where rescued girls are given food, healthcare, a home and the chance to go to school, as well as training for jobs when they are older. Above all, she gives them safety, warmth and love. Thanks to her, 3,000 girls now have a better life.
An international child jury, consisting of children who are experts on the rights of the child through their own early life experiences as soldiers, refugees or street children, also selected Somaly Mam as the deserving recipient of this year’s World’s Children’s Prize.
An Honorary Award was jointly given to Josefina Condori, from Peru, who for 15 years has campaigned for girls work-ing as maids in slave-like conditions in the city of Cusco, in an almost feudal Peru. Literally tens of thousands of young children have been given support from her drop-in centre, receiving food, shoes clothes, healthcare, a home, the chance to go to school, security and love. More than anything else, however, she works to ensure that they know their rights.
Agnes Stevens from the United States was the second joint recipient. She has fought for America’s one million home-less children for more than 20 years. Her organisation has been helping 6 to 18 year olds, as well as their parents, with issues such as changing schools and retrieving vital lost documents, like school grades and birth certificates. They are given backpacks, school uniforms and supplies as well as money for the bus. At many shelters, Agnes has built learning rooms, with books, computers, drawing, colouring and writing materials, to give the children a quiet place to study and the chance to be just kids’ again.
This year’s prize ceremony was held at Gripsholm Castle, Sweden, where HM Queen Silvia helped children award the prizes. Participating in the celebration were some of the young people who have benefitted from the three women’s work, the youth-led jury and young musicians from South Africa, Vietnam and Sweden.

Freedom Torch Relay ","Demonstrations for Free Tibet in Edinburgh and Arran Nuns, Former Political Prisoners to March in Freedom Torch Relay from Scottish Parliament
On Sunday 30 March a Tibetan refugee was joined by seventy islanders on Arran in a peaceful vigil, in support of human rights and freedom for Tibet.
Thursday 3rd April will see further demonstrations of support for Tibet in Scotland, as a peaceful candlelit vigil will be held from 6.30 pm in St John’s Church on Princes Street in Edinburgh. Its aim will be to commemorate all the Tibetans who have died during Chinese occupation and to express solidarity for those involved in the current struggle in Tibet.
And on Friday 4th April at 2.30 pm the Freedom Torch Relay, an alternative to the Olympic Torch, in support of freedom for Tibet, will set out at 2.30 pm from Scottish Parliament accompanied by four Buddhist nuns who were held as political prisoners for many years in Tibet.
For the first Scottish public outcry since the recent violent events in Tibet, the sun shone brightly on Arran on Sunday 30th March as around seventy local islanders gathered on the seafront in Brodick for a peaceful vigil. Drawing parallels between the situation in Tibet and other troubled parts of the world, the vigil placed peaceful opposition to the oppression of human rights all over the world at its heart. A one-minute silence was observed to commemorate all those who have suffered as a result of human rights abuses. Amidst Tibetan prayer flags flapping in the wind, the ringing of prayer bowls resonated under the blue sky, as petitions were signed and messages of support were exchanged.
Tibetan refugee Pasang and her husband Philippe Gautier, who have lived on the island for four years and organized the vigil at the seafront, called on the support of all in the fifty-year long struggle of the Tibetan people in the face of Chinese government occupation. Pasang said ‘As Beijing prepares to host the 2008 Olympic Games the Chinese Government must keep its promise to observe human rights in Tibet as well as other Chinese provinces. It must also agree to talk to the Dalai Lama’s representatives, as many prominent political figures have called for in the past few weeks’. For more information please visit

Children of the Earth Lead the Way ","This summer, young people from all over the world have been gathering in the name of peace. The Meeting of Spirit Youth Elders held in Canada, The Human Rights Leadership Forum in Ghana and the YESS Peace Marathon in Nepal, have been just a few of the events on the Children of the Earth calendar for 2007.
“Children of the Earth offers youth leadership programmes, educational work-shops, conferences and presentations at national and international forums,” says President and Founder, Dr Nina Meyerhof. “We are a United Nations, not-for-profit, Non-Governmental Organisation, dedicated to building a better future for us all. Our goal is for young people all over the world to become socially responsible and active peace builders.”
Children of the Earth flies the flag for The World Spirit Youth Council. To date, young people have met in Japan, Nepal and Switzerland to discuss and develop this movement. They are now in the process of forming a Council of governance to develop ideas.
Another ongoing initiative is the Youth to Youth Bear Hugs Project’, which is led by a Youth Leadership Team to unite children around the world and promote International Day of Peace, held on 21st September each year. “Bear representa-tives have travelled out to meet young survivors of Hurricane Katrina and the Tsunami, a Ugandan orphanage and a Liberian refugee camp,” says Nina.
Children of the Earth is establishing Chapters around the world that support local youth initiatives, offer resources of information and help them develop. These are evolving in the Philippines, Ghana, Nigeria, Uganda, the USA and other countries. The goal is to establish at least 50 operating Chapters within the next three years.
In the future, Children of the Earth will be building a One Peace Institute for all youth leaders of the world. This will help organise themselves into a spiritual peacemakers movement.

For the Sake of Life and Peace ","“How to find a few moments to write these lines and forget, for a while, about the air strikes and massacres…”
This is not about death, destruction and war which has been happening night and day for nearly three weeks. It is about the families, children and individuals trying to live and go on. It is about the small farmers and producers from all over Lebanon, who gathered and formed Souk el Tayeb, Lebanon‘s first farmers market, over two years ago, beyond their religious, regional or political beliefs. They all had a dream, a vision and a reality of respecting, loving and producing the best of their land. Souk el Tayeb means the Market of Good. In Arabic, the word tayeb translates as good tasting, good as a person and more importantly good as alive ‘ an attribute so difficult to maintain these days.
Today, the Souk el Tayeb community is scattered and wounded. Ali Fahs and his family are stuck in Jebcheit, a village near Nabatyieh, completely cut off from the rest of the world and in constant threat. Nelly and Mona ran away from Majdel Zoun on the first day of the war. Their village is on the border and was one of the first to be hit. Their lands, crops, harvest and life’s work were there, but a few days ago, we heard that the whole village was completely destroyed.
Nelly and Mona’s project is the one most dear to my heart. They were trying to transform the whole region, known for its fertile land, into an organic village. They were working on rediscovering and conserving old crops and recipes, such as kechek el fouqara or jebnet el burghol, a vegan cheese made by a fermentation of cracked wheat and water. Two days before the war started, it was selected as a Slow Food presidium.
Earth & Co is the name of their project ‘ like real partners of earth and land. Now they are paying with their life for earth and land. Gilbert Aoun is from Jezzine, another village in south Lebanon, cut off from the rest of the country. He is in charge of a project that supports land mine victims ‘ those of the last war ‘ helping them raise chickens for free range eggs and bees for honey. Gilbert and some of the farmers, chickens and bees are still in Jezzine. Others have gone, leaving everything behind them. World Vision, one of the world’s leading relief agencies, supports more than 200 farmers working in organic agriculture in the fertile lands of South Lebanon. Some fled to Beirut away from the attacks but many of them remain in their lands. We know that some are safe, others wounded and there is no news of many.
Hoda el Zein is 65 years old. She used to come from her small village to Souk el Tayeb every Saturday and sell what she could pick from her own garden or the nearby forest. She called me on the first day of the war to find out if I was safe and tell me she was coming to Beirut.
After two weeks of air raids and attacks, cut telephones, cut electicity and fuel shortages, some of us decided to act for life and do Souk el Tayeb again. It was obviously impossible to set up in Beirut where it used to be, so we have taken it to Faqra, a safe mountainous area where many of the wealthy Beirutis have found refuge and still have some ‘buying power’.
At first, it seemed like a bit of a crazy thing to do ‘ to hold a farmers market again. But, thinking about all the farmers, the peak season of vegetables and fruits that would be lost if not picked, as well as the importance of every penny in such times, I felt it was my responsibility to act and set up our market again. Friday 4th August was the big day. We held it from 3 o’clock in the afternoon until 7 o’clock in the evening. Preparations were hard ‘ getting in touch with the farmers who were still able to come, in spite of some cut telephone lines, preparing proper space and structures for the market and finding a truck to move all the necessary tents and tables ‘ trucks do not dare to move anymore on the roads as they are considered to be carrying arms and hit by air raids. That Friday was a long day but a happy one ‘ happy to meet up again. Each time someone arrived, we all kissed and hugged. We were glad to meet those alive.
Youmna and Tony came with their best seasonal vegetables. Maissoun and Walid, from Kfarqatra, a remote village in the Chouf mountains, came without their two boys, who usually accompany them to market, because they thought it safer this way. They brought baskets of delicious freshly baked bread. Maurice just picked the season’s honeycombs and was busy extracting honey. Fadi lost a lot of this year’s harvest, but joined with his valley’s goods. Nada was in Beirut and joined with what she had. Abou Brahim came from Rachaya after a five hour drive, which would usually have taken no more than an hour and a half but cut up or unsafe roads and destroyed bridges made the trip much longer and harder. For a few hours it was life as usual and smiles again ‘ like as if nothing had happened. But by the end of the day, it was back to reality, planning which road was the safest to take and if everyone should go back home or drive the next morning. A simple action as proof of life, a reaction to war, destruction and death. Act by life to erase death. Learn a lesson from every experience for a better step each time. Who is right, who is wrong? No one knows. As in every war and every conflict, each side thinks they are right and tries to justify their actions ‘ even the massacres of children and mothers ‘ considering ‘the other’ as wrong and vice versa. But who is paying for their life, health and wealth? This we all know. And who is trying to go on, living and working? The crazy experience of the mountain Souk el Tayeb is not unique. War relief is not only for ‘sensational’ disasters, but also for small actions like Masrah al Madina, the city theatre, who initiated workshops for refugee children creating activities and fun for them.
We promised ourselves to go on with what we are doing and repeat our mountain souk every Friday, for the sake of life and peace. We hope that we will continue to have some safe roads to get there, enough fuel, products from our gardens… and life to do it all.
When I think of what we have all achieved together, I smile again. When I remember the laughter coming from the kids’ corner in Souk el Tayeb, or the students’ curiosity at [email protected], our educational programme, or the caring consumers and Souk el Tayeb co-producers, coming every week to ask about each other’s welfare, and still calling, when possible, to enquire about each other. When I think of the three regional markets we had to begin with. When I think of Dekenet Souk el Tayeb, our first shop for all the producers, located in the Old Souk of the biblical Byblos.When I think of Souk el Da
iia, the younger brother of Souk el Tayeb in Lattaquieh, Syria. I smile again and I think that a lot has been done and if the end comes then I’ll go with no regret. And if I am to stay, there is a lot more to do … in peace.

Parliament of the World's Religions ","The Parliament of the World’s Religions, in Barcelona, came to a close after a week of debates by nearly 8,000 members of diverse religious communities with commitments for action on religious violence, access to safe water, the fate of refugees worldwide, and the elimination of developing countries’ debts.***image1*** Namaste. Reprinted with permission from What is Enlightenment magazine. Photo: © WIE Press 2004
Executive Director of the Parliament’s Board, Dirk Ficca said: ‘When people of faith commit to address religious violence and other pressing issues facing the global community they follow through. We make a commitment not only to the world, but out of a deeply rooted religious or spiritual conviction. That is what makes the Barcelona Parliament commitments so special, and why this year’s Parliament in Barcelona is going to make an impact.’ The Council for the Parliament will monitor and support the implementation of the Barcelona Parliament’s commitments through a web-based communications network and best practice manuals.
Rev. Dr. William Lesher, Chair of Board of the Parliament’s Council spoke of the immeasurable outcomes of the Parliament. ‘Along with the strong commitments made this week, the mere presence of 8,000 people from so many different religious and spiritual traditions and places in the world is a meaningful outcome in and of itself. The impact of this is perhaps not as measurable, but equally remark-able in today’s world.’FURTHER INFORMATION : For online video interviews from the Parliament visit www.wie.org and www.big-picture.tvWEB SITE : http://www.opwr.org 2nd WEB SITE : http://www.wie.org"

Restoring Eden ","A remarkable project called Eden Again plans to fully restore what isbelieved to be the Biblical Garden of Eden. The Mesopotamian Marshlandsin southern Iraq, also known as the fertile crescent, are without doubta world heritage site. What makes this enormous project so remarkableis that it aims not only to turn these wetlands back to their formerglory but also to make possible the return of its native Marsh Arabs bygetting them to assist in the rebuilding of their homes and environment. ***image1***Marsh Arabs’ boats in Abu Sholan in south Iraq. Photo: © Damir Sagolj / Reuters 2003
Inthe 1950s, Syria and Turkey built dams to divert their river watersupstream which caused the beginning of a decline for the wetlands.Then, in the 1990s, when the Shiite Muslims took refuge in the areaafter their failed uprising during the Gulf War, Saddam Husseinsystematically caused the wilful destruction of this vital paradise asrevenge against those who would topple his government. Building whatwas known as the Mother of all Wars’ Canal, he drained theseoutstanding freshwater marshlands causing not only the destruction ofvital fish spawning grounds and the disappearance of many rare speciesof birds and mammals, but also the collapse of Marsh Arab society.
MarshArabs, also known as the Mad’an, are a distinct 5,000 year oldcommunity who have inhabited this area since the dawn of civilisation.These peaceful marsh dwellers lived in reed huts suspended above thewater level on woven mats, moved around by boat, tended water buffalo,spearfished and harvested the reed beds in much the same way they hadalways done. It is estimated that out of a population of half amillion, at least 300,000 were killed during Saddam’s regime. Thoseleft are living in refugee camps in Iran, in exile in other countriesor displaced internally in other parts of Iraq.
Azzam Alwash,himself an Iraqi exile now living in the US, watched the devastationcaused to his homelands on TV. He quickly resolved to do something andwith his wife, Suzie, founded Eden Again. Sponsored by the IraqFoundation with funding from the US Department of State, an advisorycommittee have been gathered comprising a team of scientists,engineers, and wetland experts. The first step will be to deconstructSaddam’s canal and begin to rehydrate the parched landscape. Scientistscannot be sure how a re-flow of water will affect the ecology of thedecimated area but they all agree that nature is possibly the bestmedicine.
The project is an innovative idea that could set aprecedent for the treatment of refugees worldwide. Stuart Leiderman, aUS environmentalist, believes that Eden Again comes at a time whenthousands of new refugees are emerging and this reflects an urgent needfor better repatriation efforts. ‘The marshland project,’ he says,’will be the first time in modern history where a whole bioregionalrestoration effort incorporates the memories, desires, sweat and toilof the refugees themselves in exchange for title to the communities andecosystems they restore.’FURTHER INFORMATION : The Iraq FoundationWEB SITE : http://www.iraqfoundation.org"

The Birds Have Stopped Singing in Afghanistan ","Today, when I listen to the violence couched in defence of freedom’ rhetoric, I feel compelled to let you know that terrorism is often bred of terror ñ an act of violence carried out by a person of colour’ is an act of terror ñ the bombing of Vietnam and the Sudan and Afghanistan and the horrendous crimes of war carried out by people of no colour’ is always to protect freedom and democracy and the way of life of privileged people who have no idea how the other half lives, or, in this case, dies.
And what of this way of life, this need to fill up the vacuum of hearts and minds and spirits with toys and knick-knacks designed for pleasure and created in the sweat shops of some captive labour camp in my world, the world which breeds terror? What of a way of life which denies freedom to the people who are ruled by despots and tyrants propped up by the Godfathers of Democracy and the Archangels of Freedom. What of the way of life which ensures that orange juice becomes a staple breakfast food while the orchards which grow the oranges are usurped from the tiller of the soil? Do I need to remind the western world of the stranglehold put on the indigenous economies of Latin America so that a certain way of life could continue unhindered in far away lands which are now so frightened of the terror which breeds amongst poverty and deprivation and disenfranchisement? What of a way of life where loneliness is perhaps the only terror that may keep you awake, cushioned from hunger and pain and the anguish of knowing that the guns which are pointed at you are manufactured in lands where freedom and democracy flourish?
For seven years now, each time I visited the United States, I have tried to talk about the issue of Afghanistan to anyone who was willing to listen. I tried to contact feminist organisations to discuss the possibility of helping Afghan women. I contacted major television networks to raise awareness of the situation in that country. Each time I was turned away. Today I listen to my words being spoken out of foreign mouths, made legitimate only because those mouths are on the faces of the powerful.
Earlier this year I had anticipated that there was going to be a humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan and shortly on the borders of my country. I contacted the UNHCR in Islamabad to ask if I could be of any assistance in its call for international donations. I contacted UN agencies asking if I could help with the reproductive health needs of refugee women. I received only silence. A few weeks ago, a recently appointed Goodwill Ambassador, a star of Hollywood cinema, visited the Afghan refugee camps. Her words were heard loud and clear. While I am glad to see how effective GWA’s can be, I am also saddened to be reminded of how powerless and ineffective we are, as people who suffer, as people who are robbed of our voices and our rightful places.
Over the past two weeks I have seen my country being vilified and then embraced as an ally. I have hung my head in shame at how desperately we must cling to any signs of pulling ourselves out of this quagmire. Many years ago, while working with young Afghan children whose limbs had been amputated in hospitals in the city of my father’s birth, I made a statement to the press regarding my concern for the people of Afghanistan. Unless the western world and its allies take cognisance of the fact that entire populations have been terrorized by the threat of military might for too long now, that unjust, unpopular governments have been propped up by those propagating freedom for their own people, denying freedom to the people ruled by monarchies and dictatorships, unless the resources of the world are made available for the development of two thirds of the world’s population, unless the dynamic of dominance and submission is changed, unless greed and hatred and prejudice are whittled away, then terror will continue to breed in the camps of the disenfranchised and the desperate. To know this, you have only to listen to the silence of Afghanistan. Even the birds have stopped singing in that land of my ancestors.

An American Viewpoint ","It’s understandable why many of us, after grieving and consoling the mourners, will feel anger ñ and while some demagogues in Congress have already sought to manipulate that feeling into a growing militarism (more spies, legalise assassinations of foreign leaders, increase the defence budget at the expense of domestic programmes), the more responsible’ leaders are seeking to narrow America’s response to targeted attacks on countries that allegedly harbour the terrorists.
But though the perpetrators deserve to be punished, in some ways this narrow focus allows us to avoid dealing with the underlying issues. When violence becomes so prevalent throughout the planet, it’s too easy to simply talk of deranged minds’. We need to ask ourselves, What is it in the way that we are living, organising our societies, and treating each other that makes violence seem plausible to so many people?’ …even if you reject religious language, you can see that the willingness of people to hurt each other to advance their own interests has become a global problem, and it’s only the dramatic level of this particular attack which distinguishes it from the violence and insensitivity to each other that is part of our daily lives.
We may tell ourselves that the current violence has nothing to do’ with the way that we’ve learned to close our ears when told that one out of every three people on this planet does not have enough food, and that one billion are literally starving. We may reassure ourselves that the hoarding of the world’s resources by the richest society in world history, and our frantic attempts to accelerate globalisation with its attendant inequalities of wealth, has nothing to do with the resentment that others feel toward us. We may tell ourselves that the suffering of refugees and the oppressed have nothing to do with us – that that’s a different story going on somewhere else. But we live in one world, increasingly inter-connected with everyone, and the forces that lead people to feel outrage, anger, and desperation eventually impact on our own daily lives.
The same inability to feel the pain of others is the pathology that shapes the minds of these terrorists. Raise children in circumstances where no one is there to take care of them, or where they must live by begging or selling their bodies in prostitution, put them in refugee camps and tell them that they have no right of return’ to their homes, treat them as though they are less valuable and deserving of respect because they are part of some despised national or ethnic group, surround them with a media that extols the rich and makes everyone who is not economically successful and physically trim and conventionally beautiful’ feel bad about themselves, offer them jobs whose sole goal is to enrich the bottom line’ of someone else, and teach them that looking out for number one’ is the only thing anyone really’ cares about and that anyone who believes in love and social justice are merely naive idealists who are destined to always remain powerless, and you will produce a world-wide population of people feeling depressed, angry, unable to care about others, and in various ways dysfunctional. Most people don’t act out in violent ways ñ they tend to act out more against themselves, drowning themselves in alcohol or drugs or personal despair. Others turn toward fundamentalist religions or ultra-nationalist extremism. Still others find themselves acting out against people that they love, acting angry or hurtful toward children or relationship partners. Most Americans will feel puzzled by any reference to this larger picture’. It seems baffling to imagine that somehow we are part of a world system which is slowly destroying the life support system of the planet, and quickly transferring the wealth of the world into our own pockets.
We don’t feel personally responsible when an American corporation runs a sweat shop in the Philippines or crushes efforts of workers to organise in Singapore. We don’t see ourselves implicated when the US refuses to consider the plight of Palestinian refugees or uses the excuse of fighting drugs to support repression in Colombia or other parts of Central America. We don’t even see the symbolism when terrorists attack America’s military centre and our Trade Centre ñ we talk of them as buildings, though others see them as centres of the forces that are causing the world so much pain. We have narrowed our own attention to getting through’ or doing well’ in our own personal lives, and who has time to focus on all the rest of this?
Most of us are leading perfectly reasonable lives within the options that we have available to us, so why should others be angry at us, much less strike out against us? And the truth is, our anger is also understandable: the striking out by others in acts of terror against us is just as irrational as the world-system that it seeks to confront. Yet our acts of counter-terror will also be counter-productive. We should have learned from the current phase of the Israel-Palestinian struggle, responding to terror with more violence, rather than asking ourselves what we could do to change the conditions that generated it in the first place, will only ensure more violence against us in the future.
This is a world out of touch with itself, filled with people who have forgotten how to recognise and respond to the sacred in each other because we are so used to looking at others from the standpoint of what they can do for us, how we can use them toward our own ends. The alternatives are stark: either start caring about the fate of everyone on this planet or be prepared for a slippery slope toward violence that will eventually dominate our daily lives. We should pray for the victims and the families of those who have been hurt or murdered in these crazy acts. We should also pray that America does not return to business as usual,’ but rather turns to a period of reflection, coming back into touch with our common humanity, asking ourselves how our institutions can best embody our highest values. We may need a global day of atonement and repentance dedicated to finding a way to turn the direction of our society at every level, a return to the notion that every human life is sacred, that the bottom line’ should be the creation of a world of love and caring, and that the best way to prevent these kinds of acts is not to turn ourselves into a police state, but turn ourselves into a society in which social justice, love, and compassion are so prevalent that violence becomes only a distant memory.

5 possible solutions to overpopulation ","If population growth is unsustainable, are there humane ways to limit it?
1. Empower women
Studies show that women with access to reproductive health services find it easier to break out of poverty, while those who work are more likely to use birth control. The United Nations Population Fund aims to tackle both issues at once, running microcredit projects to turn young women into advocates for reproductive health.
2. Promote family planning
Simply educating men and women about contraception can have a big impact. When Iran introduced a national family planning programme in 1989, its fertility rate fell from 5.6 births per woman to 2.6 in a decade. A similar effort in Rwanda saw a threefold increase in contraception usage in just five years.

3. Make education entertaining
The US-based Population Media Center gets creative to reach women. Its radio soap operas, which feature culturally specific stories about reproductive issues, have been heard by as many as 500 million people in 50 countries. In Ethiopia, 63 per cent of women seeking reproductive health services reported tuning in.
4. Government incentives
Those at UK charity Population Matters believe there should be a senior government official responsible for addressing population-related issues. They urge governments to promote “responsible parenthood” and say subsidies should be limited to the first two children unless the family is living in poverty.
5) One-child legislation
During China’s high controversial one-child policy, fertility fell from six births per woman in the 1960s to 1.5 in 2014. However, Amnesty International reports that the policy led to coerced or forced abortions and sterilisations. It also disrupted traditional support structures for the elderly and led to a gender imbalance.
