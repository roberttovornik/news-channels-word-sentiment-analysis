‘UK would grind to a halt without migrants’, say economists as thousands celebrate their contribution ","The UK economy would lose £328m – or four per cent of total UK daily GDP – if migrants stopped working for the day, according to new research. It comes as tens of thousands of people take part in a national day of action to celebrate migrants’ contribution
New data announced today by the New Economics Foundation suggests that if all UK-based migrant workers stopped for working for one day, the UK would lose four per cent of its daily GDP – £328m. The findings come on the day that tens of thousands of people across the UK have pledged their support for migrants by celebrating their contribution to British life.
One Day Without Us is a national day of action timed to coincide with UN World Day of Social Justice. For 24 hours, people will stand in solidarity with migrants. Actions range from the symbolic, wearing badges or posting selfies to show people’s support, to the literal. Some are holding five minutes of silence while others are lobbying to guarantee the rights of residence of EU citizens. A number of businesses will close for the day to make the point that Britain couldn’t manage for even one day without the contribution of migrants. Street celebrations are taking place in Chinatown in London, ‘poetryathons’ are being held in Sheffield and picnics in Aberystwyth, among others up and down the UK.
One Day Without Us is about celebrating the many diverse ways in which migrants have contributed to Britain
Migrant workers in the UK make up 10.9 per cent of the total workforce. But according to the Migration Observatory, that number increases dramatically in certain key sectors. Some 31 per cent of cleaning and household staff and 26 per cent of health professionals are foreign-born.
#2: It’s serious optimism
We showcase quality, independent reporting that focuses on progress and possibility. No waterskiing squirrels, just good journalism with a solutions-focused approach.
The loss of migrant workers would be “an economic calamity and an affront to the hard-won openness and inclusivity that exists,” said Stephen Devlin, senior economist at the New Economics Foundation. For the food system, he described it as particularly “life threatening”.
“Fruit pickers in the strawberry fields of Scotland, warehouses full of vegetable packers in the East of England, Lincolnshire factory line workers checking Marks & Spencer chocolate eclairs, the cashier at the corner shop where you buy your milk, or the baristas at a London Pret a Manger, so many of these jobs are done by migrants,” said Devlin.
“Today is about celebrating the contributions that migrants make to all aspects of life in Britain, including the economy. Many of our industries are entirely reliant on foreign-born workers, and we should never forget that. Our research shows that if those born overseas were to down tools for a day, our whole economic system could grind to a halt. We urgently need to address the helplessness which so many people feel in the current economy. But we will not do that by succumbing to hatred and xenophobia. So today let’s celebrate the contributions made by everyone, no matter where they were born.”
We urgently need to address the helplessness which so many people feel in the current economy. But we will not do that by succumbing to hatred and xenophobia
Marc Stears, chief executive at the New Economics Foundation, added: “Britain has a long and proud tradition of openness to people from overseas and our research conclusively shows that migrants have more than repaid for the welcome they have received. Our future as a country depends on the economic, cultural and social contribution that migrants make. As countries all around the world succumb to the siren call of populism, we need to remember that contribution and to celebrate it.”
Rachel Taylor-Beales, one of the organisers of One Day Without Us, said: “One Day Without Us is about celebrating the many diverse ways in which migrants have contributed to Britain. And these extend well beyond the economy. But it is striking to see just how much migrants do add to economic output in a single day and what this country would lose if they weren’t here.”

Inspiring immigrants: the Africans making an impact ","Immigrants don’t always generate good press, and those from Africa face particular challenges. Yet many have a positive social and economic impact. Veronique Mistiaen talks to some of those creating shared benefits for both the UK and Africa
After coming to the UK, many immigrants from Africa have gone on to become leaders in education, health, fashion and business, making a real impact both in the UK and Africa. Some have combined the expertise they have gained in the UK with their local knowledge and contacts to establish successful development projects in Africa. Others have set up foundations to support infrastructure projects across the continent.
In the UK, many have launched social projects to cater to the health, education and employment needs of African immigrants. Their organisations often target some of the most disadvantaged communities. They are having an impact because they know first-hand what challenges immigrants face when they come to the UK and how to reach out to them.
African diaspora entrepreneurs are also shifting the development agenda – at home and abroad – away from traditional aid and toward financial investment and structural improvement that will bring sustainable benefits to local people. And women hold senior positions in many African diaspora organisations, leading the way for other sectors.
Positive News profiles some of these doers from the African diaspora and looks at what they’ve achieved.
Mary Mosinghi, executive director, Africare
Mary Mosinghi (c) Africare
Mary Mosinghi trained as a teacher in her native Uganda before becoming interested in health and wellbeing after volunteering at an HIV/Aids charity. Following political instability in her country, she moved to England in 1991. There she met her husband and studied for a master’s degree in public health and health promotion.“I was deeply troubled by the effect HIV and Aids was having on my community. Ugandans at home and in the UK were being hit very hard by the virus. I was watching my Uganda school friends and their children die in hospital and would attend three HIV-related funerals every week in London. These deaths could have been easily prevented with education and medical support, which were being denied because of stigma. Ignorance was killing people.”
”Being based in the UK has enabled Africare to transfer robust and effective skills to Ugandan communities.”
Mosinghi co-founded Africare in 1995 to identify suitable carers from within the Ugandan community, who could adopt and foster HIV-positive children in the UK. The charity also runs career skills workshops, health awareness programmes and support groups for people living with HIV and Aids. During a visit to Uganda, Mosinghi decided to expand Africare to her native country. With partner organisations in eastern Uganda, Africare now provides home-based care, peer support, access to micro credit, as well as scholarships for Aids orphans. It also operates mobile health clinics and provides various training to people living with HIV and Aids.
The organisation supports more than 5,000 people in the area. “Most of us at Africare grew up in Uganda, know people across the region and have created vital links with ministers, other organisations and influential people there. For example, many people in the region had nowhere to get the antiretroviral drugs, but now we’ve linked our sister organisations with a charity that distributes the drugs and monitors progress.
“Being based in the UK has enabled Africare to transfer robust and effective skills to Ugandan communities by supporting productivity, policy development and training, and analysing performance.”

Sapellé is an online ethical boutique offering original fashion and accessories in African tribal prints and African-inspired styles, sourced from brands, social enterprises and artisans from across the continent.
Daphne Kasambala grew up in Malawi where she worked in banking before relocating to the UK with her husband in the early 2000s. She pursued her banking career in London until the financial crash of 2007, then decided to use her financial experience and contacts in retail to reignite her childhood passion for fashion.
She knew that Africa has a high number of skilled designers and artisans, but they lacked the means to compete in an international marketplace. “I thought I could provide them not only with a platform to showcase their work, but also advise them on how the market works and the type of clothes western women want.”
Kasambala now works with around 40 fashion designers and artisans from some 15 African countries. Roughly half of these are also social entrepreneurs who support domestic violence victims, women with HIV or Aids, grandmothers who look after Aids orphans and other projects.
“Africa doesn’t only have natural resources. It has a wealth of talents and the capability to create things that are desirable. We just need the infrastructure to reach global markets.”
The boutique features established and up-and-coming designers with popular fashion lines such as Afromania, Thula Sindi, KikoRomeo, Tina Lobondi, Tamboo Bamboo, Kutowa Designs, Modahnik and more.
Kasambala’s suppliers have to agree to an ethical code of conduct and commit to reinvesting profits to help local communities, but she is also looking for good designs, track record and quality products. “We don’t want you to buy Sapellé to help Africa, but because you love our dresses and necklaces – and as a bonus, the profit goes to Africa.
“Africa doesn’t only have natural resources. It has a wealth of talents and the capability to create things that are desirable. We just need the infrastructure to reach global markets.”
Sapelle will run a pop up shop from 8-30 November at 53 Monmouth Street, Covent Garden, London WC2H 9DG.
Sada Mire, founder of Somalia Horn Heritage Association
Sada Mire (c) Sada Mire
Sada Mire fled Mogadishu with her family in 1991 at the age of 14, as Somalia descended into civil war. They lived as internally displaced people in Somalia, then eventually made it to Sweden where they were granted asylum.
Finding herself in a strange country, Sada developed a desire to know her own heritage, so moved to London to study archaeology at UCL and SOAS. She became her country’s first and only archaeologist.
“The need to understand the present led me to study the past. Archaeological knowledge can help people understand what it means to be human. It shows that our identities are made up of so many different ones from the past. This helps us to accept others or things that are different.”
Mire’s work is so far limited to Somaliland, where she has already recorded ancient rock art at 100 sites (some 5,000 years old) and located medieval Islamic towns and pre-Islamic Christian burial sites. She estimates there might be more than 1,000 such sites waiting to be recorded.
“She regards national heritage as a human right, crucial to a nation’s sense of itself even during times of conflict and famine.”
Working in conservation in a land ravaged by war, where people are often very poor and may not be able to prioritise their heritage, is challenging. But she regards national heritage as a human right, crucial to a nation’s sense of itself even during times of conflict and famine.
Mire’s approach is to help local communities reap the economic and social benefits from archaeological resources while getting closer to their cultural heritage.
“I try to develop their skills and also protect, research and manage the sites and disseminate the knowledge. So far people have responded well and have been actively involved in finding ways to invest in and benefit from their cultural heritage, especially the tourism sites.”
Mire has helped establish the Department for Archaeology and Tourism for Somaliland, attracting government interest to numerous sites and raising awareness of the need to preserve them. She is also the founder and executive director of the Horn Heritage Charity, which assists the mapping of all monuments and sites of Somaliland and the creation of Somaliland national heritage law.

In the UK, she pioneered a development enterprise to combat the root causes of social deprivation and poverty. WORD provides support and education to Black, Asian and ethnic minority (BME) communities in the UK, and to women and children internationally.
The charity now operates in 16 countries 14 across sub-Saharan Africa and India, as well as continuing its work in the UK.
Yvonne Aki-Sawyerr, investments director at Idea-UK
Yvonne Aki-Sawyerr grew up in Sierra Leone, then studied at LSE in London and had a career in finance there. Following the war in Sierra Leone, which began in 1999, she founded the Sierra Leone War Trust for Children, for which she continues to act as chairwoman.
In March 2009, Aki-Sawyerr and her husband felt they needed to do more to make a difference in Sierra Leone, and that the ‘not-for-profit’ sector was sufficiently helping people to improve their opportunities.
Giving up their jobs, they founded the real estate development enterprise Idea-UK in Sierra Leone. A whole team of Sierra Leone diasporans moved from Europe to Freetown, Sierra Leone’s capital city, to help develop the business. Their aim is to create long-term development with a lasting difference, providing access to new business models, jobs and wealth creation. Current ventures include the first Hilton Hotel, due for completion in 2014, which has employed hundreds of local people and will help develop the tourism industry in the country."

UN launches online consultation for young migrants ","The UN’s Youth division has run a four-week online consultation to engage with young international migrants. The results will be fed into the UN’s 2013 Youth Report
Launched in January, the project used interactive tools such as topically driven comment boards and online surveys to question migrants aged 15 to 35.
The e-consultation, based around weekly themes, covered questions ranging from migrant experiences in transit countries to the challenges and opportunities they face when arriving abroad or on returning home.
Using the consultation’s results, the UN aims to shed light on the life experiences of migratory issues, youth migration and young migrants, defined by the UN as someone who has spent a year residing outside of their country of origin.
In 2010 it was estimated that there were approximately 214 million international migrants, with those aged 15 to 24 accounting for 27 million.
A UN report found that migrants between the ages of 15 to 29 are the most mobile of any migrant age group, accounting for between 36 to 57% of all international migration."

The photographer who hopes to inspire action on climate change through his pictures ","Photographer Ashley Cooper’s book Images from a Warming Planet documents his personal journey to come to terms with humanity’s impact on the planet
The UN Climate Change Conference in Paris in 2015 was hailed as a historic landmark in the battle against climate change, but, says British environmental photographer Ashley Cooper, is it enough?
“I obviously applaud this momentous agreement,” he said, “but, having witnessed the scale of the destruction currently being wreaked around the world, this is too little too late.”
In his book, Images from a Warming Planet, Cooper hopes his photography will ‘wake people up’ to the reality of climate change as well as showcasing efforts to tackle the huge challenge. Photographs range from shots showing increasing rates of desertification, to images capturing the huge range of renewable energy projects across the globe.
The project began in 2004 with a trip to Alaska, which Cooper took after reading scientific journals and becoming increasingly aware of the potentially devastating consequences of climate change.
“I spent a week on Shishmaref, a tiny island in the Chukchi Sea,” he said. “It is home to a community of around 600 Inuit people, whose homes were being washed into the sea. It was here I first witnessed something I have seen many times since: that is, those least responsible for climate change are most impacted by it.
“The evidence that the Arctic was warming rapidly was so strong, coupled with talking to Inuit elders about the changes they had witnessed in their lifetimes, left me in no doubt that documenting this should be my life’s work. The plan soon formulated in my head that I should attempt to document the impacts of climate change and the rise of renewable energy on every continent.”
Cooper went on to witness drought and bushfires in Australia, devastating floods in Malawi, smoke-belching coal-fired power stations in China and rising sea levels in Tuvalu that threaten the very existence of the Pacific island.
Those least responsible for climate change are most impacted by it
But hopes the book is empowering as well as eye-opening. “I wanted to cover what is causing climate change, the impacts this is having and what we can do about it.”
The potential climate change solutions featured include one of the world’s largest solar power station in California, floating houses in the Netherlands that are designed to help residents adapt to rising sea levels, and the use of geothermal heating in Iceland.
“The highs were truly uplifting,” said Cooper.
“I spent three weeks in India documenting renewable energy, firstly in the Sunderbans, in the Ganges Delta, where a solar project was delivering electricity to poor subsistence farmers for the first time. Each house had a battery that they carried to the solar station once a week to recharge. The battery was enough to recharge a mobile phone and provide light in their houses, avoiding the need to use highly polluting kerosene lamps inside. What a joy it was to see children able to do their homework by the clean light of a low energy electric lightbulb.”
Talking to Inuit elders about the changes they had witnessed in their lifetimes left me in no doubt that documenting this should be my life’s work
The book features a foreword by environmentalist and writer Jonathon Porritt who describes it as “an extraordinary collection of images and a powerful call to action”.
Cooper is now fundraising in a bid to send a copy of the book to every world leader and UK MP.

How to feed ourselves in a time of climate crisis ","From saving seeds to curbing food waste Raj Patel and Tracy Matsue Loeffelholz present 13 ideas for a fair and sustainable food system
Changing the food system is the most important thing humans can do to fix our broken carbon cycles. Meanwhile, food security is all about adaptation when you’re dealing with crazy weather and shifting growing zones. How can a world of 7 billion people – and growing – feed itself?
Land ownership
1. Indigenous land sovereignty
The world is watching as historic land reforms on the Pacific Island nation of Vanuatu show how to return land sovereignty to indigenous people. The decade-long effort led by Ralph Regenvanu, leader of the Land and Justice Party, is returning control of lands to “customary owners.” More than 80 per cent of land in Vanuatu is considered customary: owned by extended families as custodians for future generations.
2. Agroecology, not chemicals
Instead of single crops and fossil fuel-based amendments, agroecology relies on complex natural systems to do a better job. Bean crops that help soil retain nitrogen are rotated with other crops. Farm animal waste is used as fertiliser. Flowers attract beneficial insects to manage pests. Intensive planting of diverse crops requires less water and helps keep weeds under control.
3. Carbon sequestration
A benefit of soil regeneration practices, which make soils more fertile and resilient to land degradation, is that carbon from the atmosphere is captured in soil and plant biomass. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change says carbon sequestration accounts for 90 per cent of global agricultural mitigation potential by 2030.
4. Resilient polyculture
After hurricane Ike hit Cuba in 2008, researchers found polyculture plantain farms had fewer losses than monoculture farms. In general, strongly integrated agroecological farms sprang back to full production two months sooner than conventional farms.
Seeds
5. Open source seeds
The Open Source Seed Initiative was created by plant breeders, farmers, and seed companies as an alternative to patent-protected seeds sold by agricultural giants such as Monsanto. Its goal is to make seeds a common good again, equipping new crop varieties with an open source license. This allows farmers to save and trade seeds and develop their own hybrids for climate adaptation.
6. Genetic diversity
Traditional plant varieties are more adaptive than modern hybrids. In Peru, six Quechua communities form the ANDES Potato Park project, which holds about 1,500 varieties of cultivated potatoes. The project not only models seed diversity conservation, but also studies the traditional knowledge, practices, and spiritual beliefs that nurture those resources.
Some 30 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions come from industrial agriculture
7. Better pay
Agroecology requires skilled labour, yet the worst-paying jobs in the US are in the food system. This makes food and farm labour a poverty issue. Food service jobs are held primarily by women and people of colour, making it a social justice issue. Policies addressing these issues would increase wages (which the Fight for $15 campaign wants), protect field workers from harmful chemicals and treat the migrant labour force fairly.
8. Valuing traditional knowledge
Scientists in Latin America are tapping traditional farmers for their expertise. “Campesino a Campesino” (translated as “peasant to peasant”) is the cultural model of knowledge dissemination throughout Latin America. Farmers sharing their results and ideas have helped to spread agroecological practices.
Distribution
9. Regional food hubs
Will we stop flying out-of-season produce around the world? Australia’s Food Connect programme delivers ecologically and ethically produced fruits and vegetables, dairy products, and bakery items from local farmers to consumer hubs. In Brisbane, door-to-door travel must be no farther than 250 miles, and farmers are paid four times what they would get from big grocery chains.
10. Accessibility, affordability
Those on low-incomes are a large and ready market for farmers. Programmes like Double Up Food Bucks in the US mean farmers market shoppers get double the value on benefits provided by the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) – nutrition assistance for low-income American individuals and families. In 2013, more than 10,000 first-time SNAP customers in Michigan used farmers markets.
Diet
11. Eat together
Considering the energy used in daily cooking for 7 billion people, collective cooking and eating should be a goal. Not only does it cost less carbon per plate, but research also shows that when eating is a social activity, it can influence people to make healthier choices.
Where eating is a social activity, people are healthier
12. A plate full of plants
Dan Barber, chef at Blue Hill restaurant, author of The Third Plate and known for his work to use less carbon in the production and serving of his food, argues that our standard plate of dinner should shift from a slab of protein with a side of vegetables to a plate full of seasonal vegetables with perhaps meat in a seasoning or a sauce. Some 30 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions come from industrial agriculture, including deforestation to support livestock.
13. Waste nothing
The total land needed to grow feed for Europe’s pork industry alone is the size of Ireland. The UK-based Pig Idea campaign encourages feeding leftover catering food to pigs because 40 per cent of what farms produce is wasted. Also, the Gleaning Network has rescued more than 288 tonnes of produce in the UK over the past four years.

Stop supporting ‘hostile’ tabloid rhetoric, campaign urges mobile phone giants ","Stop Funding Hate is urging leading UK mobile phone providers to halt advertising in newspapers that ‘promote hate’
Campaign group Stop Funding Hate has today launched a campaign urging EE, Vodafone, BT, Three, O2 and other UK mobile phone providers to stop advertising in The Sun, Daily Mail and Daily Express. Campaigners are asking them to ‘Start spreading love and #StopFundingHate’.
It comes within a week of The Sun newspaper publishing an article about Brexit and immigration by columnist Trevor Kavanagh in which he cited sexual abuse cases in Rotherham and suggested that “Muslims are a specific rather than a cultural problem”. Kavanagh concluded the piece by asking “What will we do about the Muslim problem?”.
So far, more than 100 cross-party politicians have signed an open letter demanding action against what they describe as the use of “Nazi-like language” regarding the Muslim community.
“The scale of this week’s reaction to The Sun’s divisive article suggests that there is a growing movement of people who want to push back against this kind of hostile rhetoric, and reassert the need for empathy, unity and mutual respect,” said Richard Wilson, director of Stop Funding Hate.

Stop Funding Hate, which was founded in August 2016, calls on advertisers to boycott newspapers that promote ‘demonisation and division’. The project gained widespread media attention in November 2016 when Lego announced it would no longer run promotional giveaways with the Daily Mail.
Fiyaz Mughal, founder of the hate crime prevention charity Tell MAMA, said: “Headlines that are developed to sell papers and that malign whole communities have real and direct impacts. Advertisers need to realise that they are the lifeblood of these papers that are churning out such divisive material. Do they really want to be associated with such actions?”
Advertisers are the lifeblood of these papers who are churning out divisive material. Do they really want to be associated with such actions?
Above all, said Wilson, this is about core human values. “This new phase of the Stop Funding Hate campaign seeks to emphasise positive values: love, kindness, compassion and respect for others, whatever their religion, ethnicity, gender or sexuality.
“We believe that the overwhelming majority of people still support these basic principles, even if they seem to be coming under increasing attack.”
The campaign was launched on Facebook and Twitter with a video filmed by Stop Funding Hate campaigners using their mobile phones. Wilson and his small team are asking people to share the video and urge their mobile phone providers to rethink their advertising policy.
“The core message is that the power is in our hands,” said Wilson. “If we’re unhappy that our phone is helping to fund negative stories demonising Muslims, migrants and other groups, then we can also use that phone to do something positive about it.”
The campaign is being run in partnership with creative agency Mohawk, and Citizens UK’s migrant youth campaign group Stand Up Stand Out. It is also backed by the National Union of Students.

The kids are all right (and these surprising statistics prove it) ","Despite a seemingly gloomy present, the future of the US looks bright, believes Mike Males. Research suggests that young Americans are turning away from crime and drugs and towards tolerance and inclusivity
As their elders deteriorate into social epidemics and reactionary nationalism, young Americans as a generation are avoiding crime, violence, prison, dropout, and other major life determinants and adopting more inclusive, global attitudes.
This isn’t “kids are all right!” romanticism; it’s a confluence of hard facts and trends. As American politics seems increasingly hopeless, striking generation gaps in attitudes and behaviours have emerged. Leaders and experts don’t comprehend how seismic youth improvements have been or what’s driving them.
The gap begins with demography. The census finds Americans under 25 (51 per cent white, 25 per cent Latino, 14 per cent black, 5 per cent Asian, 5 per cent other/mixed) to be far more diverse than their elders (aged 55+: 74 per cent white).
In harbingers such as California, nearly three-quarters of young people now are of colour, and half have at least one foreign-born parent. That’s what America’s future looks like.
And they’re leading a revolution. The statistics look like typos, but they’re real.
As California’s teenage youth population grew by 1 million from 1990 to 2015, Department of Justice, Centers for Disease Control (CDC), and census figures show their murder arrests fell from 658 to 88 in Los Angeles (and in the notorious city of Compton, from 269 to 8), violent crimes from 21,000 to 7,000, property felonies from 54,000 to 7,000, total criminal arrests from 220,000 to 63,000, gun killings from 351 to 84, juvenile imprisonments from 10,000 to 700, births from 26,000 to 7,000, and school dropout rates from 16 per cent to 6 per cent. College enrolment and graduation soared (from 34 per cent to 47 per cent).
In the 1970s, 10 per cent of young Californians were arrested every year; in the 1990s, 7 per cent; today, 2 per cent.
While erudite magazines recycle tiresome railings against “terrible teens,” California teenagers are acting better than adults in nearly all indexes. And not just privileged youth are doing so. Troubles plummeted in tough East Oakland (a neighbourhood in the city of Oakland) and the affluent city of Irvine alike. Not because authorities “got tough;” just the opposite. Very few youths get busted for pot, drinking, curfew or similar offences any more; arrests for “underage” this or that are fast disappearing.
Leaders and experts don’t comprehend how seismic youth improvements have been or what’s driving them
While California’s trends are especially pronounced, FBI and CDC data shows major declines in youth problems occurring across the country – from Connecticut to Texas, Michigan to Arizona, Atlanta to Seattle, in areas with vigorous anti-violence measures and those with none, with strong gun controls or “gun rights” regimes, with lots of kids in prison or few. Since 1995, the FBI’s 40 reporting states saw juvenile violent and property crime declines of at least 55 per cent; 23 had declines of over 70 per cent.
That large improvements among youth occurred in areas with very different conditions and policies makes them difficult for ideologues and experts to explain. Analyses show repressive measures that were supposed to make youth safer, like higher drinking ages, teen driving bans, and curfews, have either proven ineffective or made dangers worse. Little has been done to reduce staggering levels of poverty afflicting the young. College tuitions have soared, along with student debt.
The credit for improvements appears to lie with younger generations themselves. What experts like Princeton’s John DiIulio once considered the nightmare scenario – thousands more dark-skinned youth (“adolescent super-predators”) on the streets, less policed than ever – now looks like a beacon of hope in an America whose adults, from exploding middle-aged drug and crime scourges to political regressions, act ‘crazier’ every day.
Maladaptation to racial and social change appears to underlie real pathologies, particularly among aging whites. Middle-aged rural and suburban whites’ soaring death rates from drugs and guns are now higher than those of inner-city black and Latino teenagers. America’s fastest growing prison population is middle-aged whites, while younger people show big decreases. President Trump blames white malaise on drug-running immigrants and city-dwellers, but whites are 75 times more likely to die from self-inflicted drug overdoses and suicides, and six times more likely to be murdered by other white people, than to be killed by non-white assailants.
When it comes to America’s racial transition, driven by immigration frightening Trump-voting whites, California’s been there, done that. After the 1980s and 90s anti-immigrant/drug-war/crime-crackdown/school-defunding/prison-building panics, California’s new era of liberal reforms emerged – and Californian whites (a 70 per cent majority in 1980; a 40 per cent minority today) are doing splendidly, richer than ever, safer than whites elsewhere from deadly drugs and guns – and voting against Trump.
The credit for improvements appears to lie with younger generations themselves
That most older whites still refuse to accept a multiracial society accompanies a counter-reaction in which diverse associations contribute to young people’s positive trends. White youth living in and around immigrant-friendly Los Angeles and New York City are considerably safer from drug, suicide, and firearms death than white youth elsewhere in the country. Younger whites, particularly young white women, increasingly resemble non-whites in social attitudes, while older white people remain far more reactionary.
Polls and surveys consistently show younger people in the US strongly support gay marriage (and universally accept interracial marriage), religious tolerance, a “welcome all” stance toward immigrants, scientific reasoning rather than religious faith, action to reverse climate change, proactive government action on the economy and health care, and liberal/left candidates who act on these agendas. Americans age 50 and older generally hold the reverse positions; older whites still oppose interracial marriage, would ban all immigration, and harbour intense “racial resentment”.
Exit polls in the 2016 election showed the under-25 (anti-Trump) versus 45-older (pro-Trump) split exceeded 35 points. In many states, especially in the south, young and old occupy different political and social worlds. In California, a triangulation of exit polls shows, young white men voted against Trump by 20 points, young white women by 40 points, older white women by 10 points, and all ages of colour by 40-80 points; only white men 40 and older supported Trump. California maps the future of the US electorate.
A shrinking contingent of racist and violent youth who occasionally generate deplorable headlines remains, but they’re not symptoms of mass depravity. Hard-nosed facts and trends show future-oriented Americans should look to young people as validating progressives’ faith in diversity and globalism. Incorporating younger ages into voting, office-holding, and civic leadership are keys to activating the potential of today’s remarkable youth revolution to reverse the current destructive public fray.

‘I’m a 16-year-old world champion climber: I feel like I’m dancing on the rock’ ","World champion rock climber Ashima Shiraishi won her first competition when she was just seven. Now, her sights are set on the 2020 Olympics
Ashima Shiraishi is a world champion rock climber. She was born in New York in 2001, the daughter of Japanese immigrants, and won her first competition at the age of seven. She went on to win the American Bouldering Series Youth National Championship for five consecutive years, excelling at climbing without ropes and harnesses. In 2015 she set records when she climbed the Open Your Mind Direct route at Santa Linya in Spain, becoming the first female and the youngest person to have achieved a climb of this difficulty. In the 2015 Golden Pitons she was named Climber of the Year. She hopes to compete at the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo.
Her story features in a book that is designed to inspire a new generation of girls: The Female Lead.

“I started rock climbing when I was six years old in Central Park in New York City. One day I was playing at a playground in the park and I saw people climbing on this big rock. I was really interested and started to do it too. I kept on falling but every day I went back. I had no climbing shoes so I just wore sneakers.
I climb on outdoor rocks and mountains. I also do competitions on artificial rock but I prefer real rock climbing. Climbing is exhilarating; you go up so high and sometimes it’s scary, but the fear is an exciting feeling, and when you get to the top, it’s the best feeling. I have fallen countless times, but that’s what makes it so special when you get to the top.
I kept on falling but every day I went back. I had no climbing shoes so I just wore sneakers
I do two types of climbing. One is free climbing [bouldering], which means that it’s only me and the rock. There is nothing to help me – only chalk for my hands, but no harnesses or ropes. You climb a rock that’s about 15 feet, so not too high. I also do sport climbing where you climb 100 or more feet and you wear a harness and a rope and someone’s belaying you [the technique of securing the climber during a climb]. They are both climbing, but they are very different. One is like a marathon whereas the other is like a sprint.

Climbing is so natural for me, it’s almost like dancing on the rock. Since my dad was a dancer, I feel I naturally have that movement inside me. Sometimes it’s almost like flying up the wall and sometimes you actually do fly through the air to grab on to rocks. When I am climbing, I try not to be nervous. A lot of people get really stressed and when you’re like that it’s hard to climb because there are so many things going on in your mind.
Rock climbing is pretty dangerous. You can die and you can definitely get injured. It’s a risky sport, but if you pay attention and are aware of what you are doing and are focused, then you’re fine. I haven’t got injured but I have a lot of callouses on my fingers and my feet from rock climbing. Sometimes I get scared when I am high up in the air, but most of the time I am relaxed and composed. Of course, when you are falling, it’s definitely not fun – you are frustrated, but during those times I just think about getting to the top and how I will feel when I get there.
Climbing is so natural for me, it’s almost like dancing on the rock
Once I have done one hard climb I always look for a harder one and keep on pushing my limit, because that’s what climbers do. Climbing is both a physical and a mental sport. You really have to think when you’re climbing, so you have to be smart. First you have to see the path that you’re going to take – that’s one of the most important parts. You look at the climb and see where you are going to put your hands and then you look at where you’re going to put your feet and how your body is going to be positioned.
You can never 100 per cent know what you are going to do though. I always improvise along the way. You can’t look at a climb from the bottom and have it perfectly, so as you are climbing you change your sequence. People have told me that I have a high climbing IQ so I can see the sequence very easily and I do sequences that no one else imagines.
I love to do competitions and I love to travel around the world. It’s definitely hard to manage school and climbing. I wake up at 6.30 in the morning and I go to school until 3.30pm. I go to a climbing gym from four until eight, and then I go back home, eat dinner and do homework. When I go to sleep it’s about 1am, so it’s a hard schedule. I care about school and I love to learn but homework is definitely one of my challenges.
My dream is to keep on climbing and I want to push the female boundaries of rock climbing and maybe have females dominating the sport. Physical strength is important but the most important thing is good concentration. I feel like climbing has made me a more disciplined person and, even at school, it shows.
I have fallen countless times but that’s what makes it so special when you get to the top
Sometimes I want to stop climbing because there is so much going on in my life and I just want to be like anyone else, but I always return to it because I just love it so much. If I don’t do it, then it feels like I am losing something. I have two worlds – friends at school who don’t climb and friends from the climbing world. I like to hang out with my friends from school and just be a normal teenager, going to movies and figure skating.
Both my parents are very supportive and I am the only child. My father coaches me and, because he used to be a dancer, he has helped me to move more delicately on the rock and really understand how to keep my core tight and how to prepare mentally. My mum makes all my climbing pants and sometimes she comes to competitions with me too. I hope to be in the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo. As a little girl, my dream was to be in the Olympics.”

Life after white supremacy: the former extremists now helping others leave fascism ","Four former members of right wing extremist groups share their stories of how they overcame their hate-filled pasts and are now helping turn others’ lives around
Robert Örell: radicalised when barely a teenager, now a bridge from neo-Nazism back to Swedish society
Robert Örell (pictured) is director at Exit Sweden, an organisation helping people disengage from radical groups. After becoming involved in neo-Nazi groups when he was very young, Örell became disillusioned with the movement. He co-chairs the Exit working group of the European Commission’s Radicalisation Awareness Network
“I had a lot of trouble at school and was searching for something to explain why I had all these problems. The white power movement had a simple and easily digestible answer: it was due to our multicultural society. I had my first contact when I was 12 or 13 and I started engaging when I was 14. I directed all my rage there.
“Initially it was a lot about being a tough macho man: drinking and fighting a lot. But then I started to read more about the ideology, too. I began exercising lots, trying to become this elite kind of person we were always talking about. But the movement was full of broken souls who drank a lot and got into trouble.
Do we really want to exclude people because they’ve done wrong? Is it because they’re evil, or because of circumstances?
“I started to rethink who I wanted around me. Is this really the ‘Aryan elite’ that’s going to rule the country after the revolution? I think this comes to a lot of the extremist groups: they have utopian ideas but they are never called to reality-test their vision for society. What type of people will you have around? How will you organise society without all of the people you want to exclude?
“We started Exit Sweden in 1998. Because of my own experiences, I can identify with a lot of the stories I hear. I also know it’s possible to change. We call formers credible messengers – we are able to bridge the gap between neo-Nazi groups and society.
“Why should society help these people? It’s a relevant question. But who are we to decide that somebody is unchangeable or that they deserve to be completely excluded? I know just how powerful the process of radicalisation is. It’s a moral value to me: do we really want to exclude people from society because they’ve done wrong? Is it because they’re evil, or because of circumstances?
“Now, I want to put my experiences to good use. I get such satisfaction from seeing people leave these movements and build totally new, healthy lives.”

Tony McAleer: the former white supremacist who realised the power of compassion
Tony McAleer used to be a skinhead recruiter and an organiser for the White Aryan Resistance. As well as committing acts of violence, he was found to have contravened the Canadian Human Rights Act by spreading messages of hate. But becoming a father in his 20s changed everything. He is executive director of US-based non-profit Life After Hate and also works as an inspirational speaker.
“When I was 10, I walked in on my dad with another woman. It was very confusing and made me incredibly angry. I went from being a straight-A student to getting Cs. My parents and teachers decided they would try to beat the grades into me.
“The bullying strategy I’d devised was ‘befriend the bully: become the bully’. And so I became friends with two guys I met at a punk concert and we started to build up the skinhead scene. Being able to walk down the street and generate fear was intoxicating.
“Someone asked me once: ‘Tony, how did you lose your humanity?’ But I didn’t lose it: I traded it for acceptance and approval until there was nothing left. Part of my great shame is not only the violence I did, but that I should have known better, having experienced powerlessness myself. Now I believe that the level to which we’re willing to dehumanise others is a mirror to how disconnected from our humanity we are inside.

“At 23, I found myself in a delivery room, being handed a baby girl. She hadn’t yet opened her eyes and I knew that my face was the first picture her brain would ever take. Suddenly, I had to make decisions for someone else. Kids don’t see self-loathing; they see us for the magnificent human beings that we all are. I was able to open up my heart and allow it to thaw over time. Now, I carry healthy shame. I loathe the things that I did but I don’t loathe me.
“There was nothing available for me when I left: I stumbled through the wilderness and luckily found a way out. Now, I can help somebody who is a few steps back to be less lost. It’s about compassion and forgiveness but it’s important to have both with boundaries.
“The pain and the loneliness when you’re in the void, having left but not yet re-entered mainstream society, is huge. As Martin Luther King said: ‘Hate cannot drive out hate, only love can do that.'”
Angela King: from violent skinhead to rehabilitating other Americans
Struggling for a sense of identity as a teenager growing up in Florida, a group of skinheads made Angela King feel welcome for the first time. After receiving a six-year prison sentence for her part in the armed robbery of a Jewish-owned shop, she went on to leave the movement and achieve a master’s degree. King is co-founder and deputy director of Life After Hate.
As a young person, I faced bullying, had low self-esteem and was socially awkward. A girl three times my size started a fight with me, ripping my shirt open in front of the entire class. From that point on, I felt that if I was the one doing the bullying, I could never be humiliated like that again. Neo-Nazi skinheads seemed the perfect fit because they were often angry and often violent, just like me. I’d been taught racism and homophobia as a child and felt that I had finally found the place where I belonged.
I felt that if I was the one doing the bullying, I could never be humiliated again
Sometimes women follow a romantic partner or relative into the movement. And then they are placed in conflicting roles: they’re expected to take on traditional women’s roles but also to be strong activists and willing to carry out violence. I’ve seen and, experienced, abuse and violence within these movements: domestic violence, sexual violence and emotional abuse.
When the Oklahoma City bombing happened, I realised it was done by someone with the same beliefs as me. I couldn’t see myself committing that level of violence, especially against children, so I made a decision at that time to leave the group and the lifestyle.
Stefan: after being part of violent clashes with far left, homosexual and immigrant groups, Stefan (not his real name) decided the neo-Nazi movement was ultimately devoid of meaning and left it behind
Grappling with complex social questions, Stefan found understanding and belonging in the Swedish far right movement. But it wasn’t to last. The non-judgmental ethos of Exit Sweden helped him to renounce his views, and turn his attention to contributing to society instead.
“I was active for nine years, from 2006 and 2015. At first, I was active in the movement but I wasn’t a member of an organisation. Later, I joined the group which was the largest of its kind in Sweden at the time: the National Socialist Front. I was quickly given more responsibility, and more of a role.
“I’ve always been someone who has thought a lot about societal issues. When I was at school, aged 16-18, there was a lot of interest in political alternatives. But I didn’t find anything in the mainstream parties that explained how we could build society in a new way: on a new foundation. So I searched outside of the mainstream.
“My ideas didn’t feel like they were ‘against’ other people – it wasn’t built primarily on hate – but more on preserving the idea of a Swedish social foundation. I wanted a strong society, and I think it’s a deep human response to be fearful about things – or people – that are ‘new’ or different.
“Violence was not the primary drive for me, but it was always present. We ‘legitimised’ it by the idea that we must be prepared in self defence. I was involved in about 25 confrontations within two years: stabbings and assaults. These were usually with extreme left wing groups but immigrant groups too and homosexuals: anyone that we considered a threat to ‘core family values’.
“I was busted for having a knife on me which is illegal in Sweden. But violence is what strengthens the group: it makes you feel tighter together, and then this sense of strength escalates into new fights.
I want people to be able to be part of society together: to find a sense of community, togetherness and belonging
“At first, my ideological commitment to the group was very strong. But in about 2013, I started to feel a shift. I realised that the race issue simply wasn’t as important as I had previously thought. I also started studying and while at university, came into contact with two elderly men. One was a political activist from Uruguay, and the other was from Somalia.
“As we got to know each other, I realised there were lots of similarities in what we identified in society as problems. I started to accept that if people are facing these similar problems in three very different parts of the world, this is probably more of a global challenge, not related to the previous explanation I had formed.
“By the time I got in touch with Exit Sweden, I had already left the movement. But I wanted to make a definite shift in order to disengage and reflect on what I’d done and been part of.
“There were no demands: it didn’t feel like attending Exit was a punishment. It felt open and non-judging. I was able to adjust at my own pace. I felt listened to, and that helped me to change. Talking openly about my experiences has helped me to make the shift.
“My personality had been very linked to the political ideological environment of the Nazi group. I learned that ‘this was good’ and ‘this was bad’. But now I’m open to thinking about things in new ways. I talked to my former history teacher about perhaps coming into the school to talk to his class about my experiences. I want to help people understand. I want people to be able to be part of society together: to find a sense of community, togetherness and belonging.”

Why being bilingual helps keep your brain fit ","Most people in the world speak more than one language, suggesting the human brain has evolved to work in multiple tongues. If so, asks Gaia Vince, are those who speak only one language missing out?
In a cafe in south London, two construction workers are engaged in cheerful banter, tossing words back and forth. Their cutlery dances during more emphatic gesticulations and they occasionally break off into loud guffaws. They are discussing a woman, that much is clear, but the details are lost on me. It’s a shame, because their conversation looks fun and interesting, especially to a nosy person like me. But I don’t speak their language.
Out of curiosity, I interrupt them to ask what they are speaking. With friendly smiles, they both switch easily to English, explaining that they are South Africans and had been speaking Xhosa. In Johannesburg, where they are from, most people speak at least five languages, says one of them, Theo Morris. For example, Morris’ mother’s language is Sotho, his father’s is Zulu, he learned Xhosa and Ndebele from his friends and neighbours, and English and Afrikaans at school. “I went to Germany before I came here, so I also speak German,” he adds.
Was it easy to learn so many languages?
“Yes, it’s normal,” he laughs.
He’s right. Around the world, more than half of people – estimates vary from 60 to 75 per cent – speak at least two languages. Many countries have more than one official national language – South Africa has 11. People are increasingly expected to speak, read and write at least one of a handful of ‘super’ languages, such as English, Chinese, Hindi, Spanish or Arabic, as well. So to be monolingual, as many native English speakers are, is to be in the minority, and perhaps to be missing out.
Multilingualism has been shown to have many social, psychological and lifestyle advantages. Moreover, researchers are finding a swathe of health benefits from speaking more than one language, including faster recovery from strokes and delayed onset of dementia.
To be monolingual, as many native English speakers are, is to be in the minority, and perhaps to be missing out
Could it be that the human brain evolved to be multilingual – that those who speak only one language are not exploiting their full potential? And in a world that is losing languages faster than ever – at the current rate of one a fortnight, half our languages will be extinct by the end of the century – what will happen if the current rich diversity of languages disappears and most of us end up speaking only one?
I am sitting in a laboratory, headphones on, looking at pictures of snowflakes on a computer. As each pair of snowflakes appears, I hear a description of one of them through the headphones. All I have to do is decide which snowflake is being described. The only catch is that the descriptions are in a completely invented language called Syntaflake.
It’s part of an experiment by Panos Athanasopoulos, an ebullient Greek with a passion for languages. Professor of psycholinguistics and bilingual cognition at Lancaster University, he’s at the forefront of a new wave of research into the bilingual mind. As you might expect, his lab is a Babel of different nationalities and languages – but no one here grew up speaking Syntaflake.
The task is profoundly strange and incredibly difficult. Usually, when interacting in a foreign language, there are clues to help you decipher the meaning. The speaker might point to the snowflake as they speak, use their hands to demonstrate shapes or their fingers to count out numbers, for example. Here I have no such clues and, it being a made-up language, I can’t even rely on picking up similarities to languages I already know.

After a time, though, I begin to feel a pattern might be emerging with the syntax and sounds. I decide to be mathematical about it and get out pen and paper to plot any rules that emerge, determined not to ‘fail’ the test.
The experience reminds me of a time I arrived in a rural town a few hours outside Beijing and was forced to make myself understood in a language I could neither speak nor read, among people for whom English was similarly alien. But even then, there had been clues. Now, without any accompanying human interaction, the rules governing the sounds I’m hearing remain elusive, and at the end of the session I have to admit defeat. I join Athanasopoulos for a chat while my performance is being analysed by his team.
What will happen if the current rich diversity of languages disappears and most of us end up speaking only one?
Glumly, I recount my difficulties at learning the language, despite my best efforts. But it appears that was where I went wrong: “The people who perform best on this task are the ones who don’t care at all about the task and just want to get it over as soon as possible. Students and teaching staff who try to work it out and find a pattern always do worst,” he says.
“It’s impossible in the time given to decipher the rules of the language and make sense of what’s being said to you. But your brain is primed to work it out subconsciously. That’s why, if you don’t think about it, you’ll do OK in the test – children do the best.”
Ancestral exchanges
The first words ever uttered may have been as far back as 250,000 years ago, once our ancestors stood up on two legs and freed the ribcage from weight-bearing tasks, allowing fine nerve control of breathing and pitch to develop. And when humans had got one language, it wouldn’t have been long before we had many.
Language evolution can be compared to biological evolution, but whereas genetic change is driven by environmental pressures, languages change and develop through social pressures. Over time, different groups of early humans would have found themselves speaking different languages. Then, in order to communicate with other groups – for trade, travel and so on – it would have been necessary for some members of a family or band to speak other tongues.
We can get some sense of how prevalent multilingualism may have been from the few hunter-gatherer people who survive today. “If you look at modern hunter-gatherers, they are almost all multilingual,” says Thomas Bak, a cognitive neurologist who studies the science of languages at the University of Edinburgh. “The rule is that one mustn’t marry anyone in the same tribe or clan to have a child – it’s taboo. So every single child’s mum and dad speak a different language.”
For Indigenous Australians, who speak more than 130 indigenous languages are still spoken, multilingualism is part of the landscape. “You will be walking and talking with someone, and then you might cross a small river and suddenly your companion will switch to another language,” says Bak. “People speak the language of the earth.”
This is true elsewhere, too. “Consider in Belgium: you take a train in Liège, the announcements are in French first. Then, pass through Loewen, where the announcements will be in Dutch first, and then in Brussels it reverts back to French first.”
This idea that you gain a new personality with every language you speak, that you act differently when speaking different languages, is a profound one
Being so bound up with identity, language is also deeply political. The emergence of European nation states and the growth of imperialism during the 19th century meant it was regarded as disloyal to speak anything other than the one national language. This perhaps contributed to the widely held opinion – particularly in Britain and the US – that bringing up children to be bilingual was harmful to their health and to society more generally.
There were warnings that bilingual children would be confused by two languages, have lower intelligence, low self-esteem, behave in deviant ways, develop a split personality and even become schizophrenic. It is a view that persisted until very recently, discouraging many immigrant parents from using their own mother tongue to speak to their children, for instance. This is in spite of a 1962 experiment, ignored for decades, which showed that bilingual children did better than monolinguals in both verbal and non-verbal intelligence tests.
However, research in the last decade by neurologists, psychologists and linguists, using the latest brain-imaging tools, is revealing a swathe of cognitive benefits for bilinguals. It’s all to do with how our ever-flexible minds learn to multitask.
Ask me in English what my favourite food is, and I will picture myself in London choosing from the options I enjoy there. But ask me in French, and I transport myself to Paris, where the options I’ll choose from are different. So the same deeply personal question gets a different answer depending on the language in which you’re asking me. This idea that you gain a new personality with every language you speak, that you act differently when speaking different languages, is a profound one.
Brain training
Athanasopoulos and his colleagues have been studying the capacity for language to change people’s perspectives. In one experiment, English and German speakers were shown videos of people moving, such as a woman walking towards her car or a man cycling to the supermarket. English speakers focus on the action and typically describe the scene as “a woman is walking” or “a man is cycling”. German speakers, on the other hand, have a more holistic worldview and will include the goal of the action: they might say (in German) “a woman walks towards her car” or “a man cycles towards the supermarket”.
Each language gives you a whole new lifestyle, a whole new shade of meaning
Part of this is due to the grammatical toolkit available, Athanasopoulos explains. Unlike German, English has the -ing ending to describe actions that are ongoing. This makes English speakers much less likely than German speakers to assign a goal to an action when describing an ambiguous scene. When he tested English-German bilinguals, however, whether they were action- or goal-focused depended on which country they were tested in. If the bilinguals were tested in Germany, they were goal-focused; in England, they were action-focused, no matter which language was used, showing how intertwined culture and language can be in determining a person’s worldview.
In the 1960s, one of the pioneers of psycholinguistics, Susan Ervin-Tripp, tested Japanese-English bilingual women, asking them to finish sentences in each language. She found that the women ended the sentences very differently depending on which language was used. For example, “When my wishes conflict with my family…” was completed in Japanese as “it is a time of great unhappiness”; in English, as “I do what I want”. Another example was “Real friends should…”, which was completed as “help each other” in Japanese and “be frank” in English.

From this, Ervin-Tripp concluded that human thought takes place within language mindsets, and that bilinguals have different mindsets for each language – an extraordinary idea but one that has been borne out in subsequent studies, and many bilinguals say they feel like a different person when they speak their other language.
These different mindsets are continually in conflict, however, as bilingual brains sort out which language to use.
In a revealing experiment with his English-German bilingual group, Athanasopoulos got them to recite strings of numbers out loud in either German or English. This effectively ‘blocked’ the other language altogether, and when they were shown the videos of movement, the bilinguals’ descriptions were more action- or goal-focused depending on which language had been blocked. So, if they recited numbers in German, their responses to the videos were more typically German and goal-focused. When the number recitation was switched to the other language midway, their video responses also switched.
So what’s going on? Are there really two separate minds in a bilingual brain? That’s what the snowflake experiment was designed to find out. I’m a little nervous of what my fumbling performance will reveal about me, but Athanasopoulos assures me I’m similar to others who have been tested – and so far, we seem to be validating his theory.
In order to assess the effect that trying to understand the Syntaflake language had on my brain, I took another test before and after the snowflake task. In these so-called flanker tasks, patterns of arrows appeared on the screen and I had to press the left or right button according to the direction of the arrow in the centre. Sometimes the surrounding pattern of arrows was confusing, so by the end of the first session my shoulders had been hunched somewhere near my ears and I was exhausted from concentrating. It’s not a task in which practice improves performance (most people actually do worse second time round), but when I did the same test again after completing the snowflake task, I was significantly better at it, just as Athanasopoulos has predicted.
Speaking multiple languages is like exercise for the brain
“Learning the new language improved your performance second time around,” he explains. Relieved as I am to fit into the normal range, it’s a curious result. How can that be?
The flanker tasks were exercises in cognitive conflict resolution – if most of the arrows were pointing to the left, my immediate impulse was to push the left button, but this wasn’t the correct response if the central arrow was pointing right. I had to block out my impulse and heed the rule instead. Another example of cognitive conflict is a test in which the names of colours are written in different colours (‘blue’ written in red, for example). The aim is to say which colour each word is written in, but this is tricky, because we read the word much quicker than we process the colour of the letters. It requires considerable mental effort to ignore the impulse just to say the word we can’t help but read.
The snowflake test prepared my ACC [the anterior cingulate cortex, a part of the brain] for the second flanker task, just as speaking more than one language seems to train the executive system more generally. A steady stream of studies over the past decade has shown that bilinguals outperform monolinguals in a range of cognitive and social tasks from verbal and nonverbal tests to how well they can read other people. Greater empathy is thought to be because bilinguals are better at blocking out their own feelings and beliefs in order to concentrate on the other person’s.
“Bilinguals perform these tasks much better than monolinguals – they are faster and more accurate,” says Athanasopoulos. And that suggests their executive systems are different from monolinguals’.
In fact, says cognitive neuropsychologist Jubin Abutalebi, at the University of San Raffaele in Milan, it is possible to distinguish bilingual people from monolinguals simply by looking at scans of their brains. “Bilingual people have significantly more grey matter than monolinguals in their anterior cingulate cortex, and that is because they are using it so much more often,” he says. The ACC is like a cognitive muscle, he adds: the more you use it, the stronger, bigger and more flexible it gets.
Bilinguals, it turns out, exercise their executive control all the time because their two languages are constantly competing for attention. Brain-imaging studies show that when a bilingual person is speaking in one language, their ACC is continually suppressing the urge to use words and grammar from their other language. Not only that, but their mind is always making a judgement about when and how to use the target language. For example, bilinguals rarely get confused between languages, but they may introduce the odd word or sentence of the other language if the person they are talking to also knows it.
Bilingual benefits
“My mother tongue is Polish but my wife is Spanish so I also speak Spanish, and we live in Edinburgh so we also speak English,” says Bak. “When I am talking to my wife in English, I will sometimes use Spanish words, but I never accidentally use Polish. And when I am speaking to my wife’s mother in Spanish, I never accidentally introduce English words because she doesn’t understand them. It’s not something I have to think about, it’s automatic, but my executive system is working very hard to inhibit the other languages.”
For bilinguals, with their exceptionally buff executive control, the flanker test is just a conscious version of what their brains do subconsciously all day long – it’s no wonder they are good at it.
A superior ability to concentrate, solve problems and focus, better mental flexibility and multitasking skills are, of course, valuable in everyday life. But perhaps the most exciting benefit of bilingualism occurs in ageing, when executive function typically declines: bilingualism seems to protect against dementia.
Being bilingual could keep our minds working longer and better into old age, which could have a massive impact on how we school our children and treat older people
Psycholinguist Ellen Bialystok made the surprising discovery at York University in Toronto while she was comparing an ageing population of monolinguals and bilinguals.
“The bilinguals showed symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease some four to five years after monolinguals with the same disease pathology,” she says.
Being bilingual didn’t prevent people from getting dementia, but it delayed its effects, so in two people whose brains showed similar amounts of disease progression, the bilingual would show symptoms an average of five years after the monolingual. Bialystok thinks this is because bilingualism rewires the brain and improves the executive system, boosting people’s “cognitive reserve”. It means that as parts of the brain succumb to damage, bilinguals can compensate more because they have extra grey matter and alternative neural pathways.
Bilingualism can also offer protection after brain injury. In a recent study of 600 stroke survivors in India, Bak discovered that cognitive recovery was twice as likely for bilinguals as for monolinguals.
Such results suggest bilingualism helps keep us mentally fit. It may even be an advantage that evolution has positively selected for in our brains – an idea supported by the ease with which we learn new languages and flip between them, and by the pervasiveness of bilingualism throughout world history. Just as we need to do physical exercise to maintain the health of bodies that evolved for a physically active hunter-gatherer lifestyle, perhaps we ought to start doing more cognitive exercises to maintain our mental health, especially if we only speak one language.
Bilinguals perform tasks much better than monolinguals – they are faster and more accurate
In recent years, there has been a backlash against the studies showing benefits from bilingualism. Some researchers tried and failed to replicate some of the results; others questioned the benefits of improved executive function in everyday life. Bak wrote a rejoinder to the published criticisms, and says there is now overwhelming evidence from psychological experiments backed by imaging studies that bilingual and monolingual brains function differently. He says the detractors have made errors in their experimental methods.
Bialystok agrees, adding that it is impossible to examine whether bilingualism improves a child’s school exam results because there are so many confounding factors. But, she says, “given that at the very least it makes no difference – and no study has ever shown it harms performance – considering the very many social and cultural benefits to knowing another language, bilingualism should be encouraged”. As for the financial benefits, one estimate puts the value of knowing a second language at up to $128,000 (£98,764) over 40 years.
Language lessons
The result of my test in Athanasopoulos’s lab suggests that just 45 minutes of trying to understand another language can improve cognitive function. His study is not yet complete, but other research has shown that these benefits of learning a language can be achieved quickly. The problem is, they disappear again unless they are used – and I am unlikely to use the made-up snowflake language ever again! Learning a new language is not the only way to improve executive function – playing video games, learning a musical instrument, even certain card games can help – but because we use language all the time, it’s probably the best executive-function exerciser there is. So how can this knowledge be applied in practice?
One option is to teach children in different languages. In many parts of the world, this is already being done: many Indian children, for example, will use a different language in school from their mother or village tongue. But in English-speaking nations, it is rare. Nevertheless, there is a growing movement towards so-called ‘immersion schooling’, in which children are taught in another language half the time. The state of Utah has been pioneering the idea, with many of its schools now offering immersion in Mandarin Chinese or Spanish.
“We use a half-day model, so the target language is used to teach in the morning, and then English is used in the afternoon – then this is swapped on other days as some learn better in the morning and some in the afternoon,” explains Gregg Roberts, who works with the Utah Office of State Education and has championed immersion language teaching in the state.
“We have found that the kids do as well and generally better than monolingual counterparts in all subjects. They are better at concentrating, focusing and have a lot more self-esteem. Any time you understand another language, you understand your language and culture better. It is economically and socially beneficial. We need to get over our affliction with monolingualism.”
The immersion approach is being trialled in the UK now, too. At Bohunt secondary school in Liphook, Hampshire, head teacher Neil Strowger has introduced Chinese-language immersion for a few lessons.
I sit in on an art class with 12-year-olds being taught by two teachers: one speaking English, the other Chinese. The children are engaged but quiet, concentrating on the task of learning multiple ideas. When they speak it is often in Chinese – and there is something rather surreal about watching young people in the UK discussing British graffiti artist Banksy in Mandarin. The children say they chose to learn in Chinese because they thought it would be “fun” and “interesting” and “useful” – a far cry from the dreary French lessons I endured at school.
The majority of the art class will take their Chinese GCSE exams several years early but Strowger tells me the programme has had many benefits in addition to their grades, including improving students’ engagement and enjoyment, increasing their awareness of other cultures so that they are equipped as global citizens, widening their horizons, and improving their job prospects.
Any time you understand another language, you understand your language and culture better. It is economically and socially beneficial
What about those of us who have left school? In order to maintain the benefits of bilingualism, you need to use your languages and that can be tricky, especially for older people who may not have many opportunities to practise. Perhaps we need language clubs, where people can meet to speak other languages. Bak has done a small pilot study with elderly people learning Gaelic in Scotland and seen significant benefits after just one week. Now he aims to carry out a much larger trial.
It is never too late to learn another tongue, and it can be very rewarding. Alex Rawlings is a British professional polyglot who speaks 15 languages: “Each language gives you a whole new lifestyle, a whole new shade of meaning,” he says. “It’s addictive!”
“People say it’s too hard as an adult. But I would say it’s much easier after the age of eight. It takes three years for a baby to learn a language, but just months for an adult.”
As the recent research shows, that’s a worthwhile investment of time. Being bilingual could keep our minds working longer and better into old age, which could have a massive impact on how we school our children and treat older people. In the meantime, it makes sense to talk, hablar, parler, sprechen, beszél, berbicara in as many languages as you can.

Pilgrimage: a change is afoot in Britain ","Recent years have seen a resurgence of interest in pilgrimage; journeying on foot. Now that it is open to all – religious or not – how can it help connect us with deep meaning, the land and each other?
Life in Britain is increasingly connected. The central heating is linked to our phones, our fridges to supermarkets, our watches to our bank accounts. We can chat to friends in Australia without touching a button. We can eat strawberries in midwinter. Connectivity is one of modern Britain’s great mantras.
Yet, behind the shiny convenience a shadowy side of disconnection looms. Our water source is a tap. Community happens ‘in app’. We travel the skies at unfathomable speeds, strapped into metal boxes watching films. Over land, we turn when the satnav says so. Separation, isolation and disempowerment are central to modern life too.

Today, pilgrimage – journeying on foot to holy places – is being rediscovered, and may help alleviate many of these problems. It is a way of reconnecting with ourselves, others and with nature and spirituality – whatever that means to each of us. Pilgrimage has happened since the earliest days of human evolution and, despite (or perhaps due to) Henry VIII banning it some 500 years ago, it rises again today with a satisfying inevitability.
You may find the word ‘holy’ hard to bear. It can provoke something like an allergic reaction. To some, the word implies exclusive religious identity. But it is thought to derive from the Old English ‘halig’ which has no religious affiliation and means holistic or healthy. Pilgrimage is open to all. Bring your own beliefs.
Pilgrimage is open to all. Bring your own beliefs
A holy place is therefore anywhere that offers wholeness or completion. This could be the source of a river, a hilltop or great tree. It might be a cathedral or stone circle. It may be a place where a hero died or an ancestor was born. And when you arrive there, you might choose to meditate, pray, sing or sleep. The intentions are up to you. Pilgrimage is as simple – and infinitely complex – as that.

About time
Travelling on foot, the slow way, elevates the place that you seek. Walking there honours the destination. No helicopter or supercar can offer this sort of access. People sometimes say they can’t sacrifice the time for pilgrimage, and the demands of modern life certainly make such pleasures difficult to fit in. But can we afford not to? To ‘sacrifice’ time does not mean to waste it. This word’s origin is the combination of the Latin words ‘sacer’ and ‘facere’ meaning ‘to make sacred’. To make your time sacred through pilgrimage is never wasteful: it expands and enriches your experience.
Pilgrimage connects us more closely with our bodies too. Walking is a great way to exercise with minimal risk of injury. It creates time to think. In jam-packed modern life, pilgrimage provides rare mental space, helping restore our senses as sovereigns of our reality.
And other people become heightened on pilgrimage. If you are in a group, be ready to meet your companions as your mirrors: to encounter in your co-walkers the best and worst of yourself. Moving slowly and stopping often, you’re likely to meet strangers of many backgrounds. I encourage you to make eye contact and greet them all. Pilgrimage is an opportunity to undo social distrust in yourself and others.

British people often don’t know their land very well. We jet to distant climes and often forget the beauty and mystery of our own islands. But we can rediscover exotic Britain by avoiding roads, and travelling upon secret green passages known as public footpaths. The weather becomes our roof, the trees our shelter, and by night the sky really is our television – in high-definition.
Pilgrims may often experience the opposite of beauty too. Pilgrimage offers a front row seat to the impact of modern industry, agriculture, housing and waste-management in Britain. But such first-hand experience, though uncomfortable at times, is an empoweringly real way to ‘take the temperature’ of our land. No article posted on Facebook comes close.
Ancient and modern
But perhaps the best of all is this: on pilgrimage, without motorised transport, central heating, lights, a TV or laptop, your ecological impact is vastly reduced, and that feels really good. Some people take it even further by shopping at local farms and filtering water from streams – maybe even pooing outdoors.
British pilgrimage follows the same paths used by the earliest Ice Age migrants to this land. Our footpaths, green lanes and hollow-ways – even our motorways – have all been hunter-gatherer trails and pilgrimage tracks.
Pilgrimage is an opportunity to undo social distrust in yourself and others
That said, I recommend taking the latest outdoor technology: ultralight down sleeping bags, solar chargers, smartphones with GPS navigation and superfine merino wool clothing. This is not a re-creation of a lost past. It is a timely response to modernity.
Pilgrimage takes away people’s hard-won domestic insulation and convenience, and puts them simply on the ground – in a very real Britain that has always been there, just over the hills and beyond the woods.
Now is the time to make your first pilgrimage, and Britain is the place. The journey is afoot.

‘Voiceless’ Roma people use comics to replace stereotypes with facts ","Roma people in the UK listed things they wanted people to better understand about their communities before their thoughts were transformed into art
‘Misunderstood’ Roma people have had their thoughts turned into comic-style art in a bid to challenge stereotypes about their heritage and culture. Members of Roma communities in Romania, Slovakia and Hungary who now live in the UK worked with Friends of Romano Lav, a Glasgow-based charity that supports young Roma migrants, to devise the Roma Guide.
Although Roma people are often described as leading a nomadic way of life, 95 per cent of European Roma people have fixed housing. Artwork: Alexandre De Maio
It is designed to stimulate interest in Roma culture, history and people – delving beyond stereotypes, as Juliana Penha who helped run the project explained. “Roma communities are underrepresented in the media and the few pieces of media coverage about them are negative,” said Penha.
“Popular knowledge about Roma culture is based on myths and negative portrayals, largely produced by media sensationalism. Despite being Europe’s largest minority, Roma people are voiceless. This project challenge the perceptions people have about these communities.”
Popular knowledge about Roma culture is based on myths and negative portrayals, largely produced by media sensationalism
Research carried out by the European Commission suggests that Roma people, of whom there are approximately 10 million in Europe, suffer more from racism than any other minority in Europe. Originally from northern India, Roma people have had a strong presence in Europe since around the 13th century. The EU has long stressed the need for better integration of and with their communities.
This guide is part of The World Profile project that explores marginalised individuals, groups and minorities on every continent using journalism, comics and animation.
Marcela Adamova is a Roma woman from Slovakia. She holds a master’s degree in public administration and is one of the founders of the Friends of Romano Lav NGO. “Because my skin is white and my eyes are blue, many people say that I do not look like Roma. But what does a Roma person look like?” she said.
Though Roma people have little representation in the media, there are many well-known figures who are thought to have Roma heritage, from Elvis Presley and Charlie Chaplin to Michael Caine and Pablo Picasso. Artwork: Alexandre De Maio
One fact in the Roma Guide investigates the difference between the words ‘Roma’ and ‘gypsy’, exploring the many prejudices often associated with the word ‘gypsy’. In London in 1971, at the first World Romani Congress, the words Roma and Romani [‘Rom’ meaning man in Romani] were chosen to define this ethnic group.

Bridging the digital divide: Hack the Hood ","A not-for-profit organisation in California is helping prepare young people of colour for careers in technology. We go behind the scenes at Hack the Hood
For Zakiya Harris, growing up in East Oakland, California, meant navigating between two acutely different worlds every day. “I grew up in the hood, but I went to a very affluent school,” she says. “So I spent my days being one of few black people, and I spent my nights being in a predominantly black neighbourhood. I believe that really shapes the work that I do, because I’ve always been a bridge-builder.”
Today, Harris is building bridges in the Bay Area of California as the co-founder of Hack the Hood, a not-for-profit organisation that introduces young people of colour to careers in technology by training them to design and build free websites for small businesses. The participants, who range in age from 16 to 25, learn crucial skills for the 21st century economy while the businesses establish an online presence that they otherwise might not have had the time, resources or know-how to build themselves. “Hack the Hood is able to level-up the skills of young people and also provide a huge economic development boost for small businesses in their community,” Harris says.

Since 2014, Hack the Hood has sponsored 16 bootcamps in eight cities across northern California. The six-week programmes have attracted a total of 234 young people from low-income neighborhoods, 92 per cent of whom have completed the course. The camps begin with an intensive two week focus on technical skills such as website design, coding and social media promotion. “After that, the programme transitions into an office,” says Harris, when the young participants are paired with small business clients and are responsible for managing their web projects.
“We want them to feel like freelancers and like a design firm,” she says. The goal is to broaden their relationship with technology. “They start to see their place in tech,” adds Harris. “They don’t just have to be consumers, they can be creatives.”
The businesses that sign on also reap great benefits. Hack the Hood typically works with ‘mom-and-pop shops’ whose owners aren’t necessarily comfortable online or with operating social media. “A lot of these folks are small, and they don’t want to be thinking about their website,” Harris says. And because of the rapidly shifting demographics of Bay Area neighborhoods, businesses that lack an online presence aren’t reaching the new residents who are moving in. “We want our local owners to be more visible,” she says. “When people are Googling the new coffee shop or the closest accountant, we want those people who have been the backbone of our city to show up in the search results.”
Hack the Hood participants don’t just gain experience working in tech, they also develop skills such as project management, public speaking, networking and perseverance. And besides learning to write code, they are given a chance to explore the more creative aspects of maintaining a web presence through site design, photography and videography.
Hack the Hood students take part in one the organisation’s six-week camps which focus on building technical skills
Tapping in to their true passions and talents helps them find their niche in technology, says Max Gibson, a lead instructor and creative strategist at Hack the Hood. “At first, they might not have an idea of what they want to do with their lives, or what their real strengths and skills are,” Gibson says. “So for me, it’s really about allowing them to discover what those things are, and then pointing them in the right direction.”
For her part, Harris sees Hack the Hood as addressing a new gulf between the technological haves and have-nots. “People typically think of the digital divide as those who have internet access versus those who don’t,” she says. But that idea is quickly becoming outdated. “The issue now is the knowledge divide. Do you know how to pull up the hood and understand the code beneath it? Do you understand what your digital footprint is going to look like?”
Hack the Hood addresses a new gulf between the technological haves and have-nots
Closing that knowledge gap has the potential to impact communities far beyond the local area. “Young people of colour are going to create platforms and opportunities in tech that no one else has,” Harris says, pointing to several apps, including those tackling police brutality, immigrant rights and other issues affecting communities of colour, produced at recent hackathons. “My generation is passing on a planet that has many, many problems. Having a diversity of voices in the decision making process is going to allow a diversity of solutions to come through.”
Technology provides important tools for solving today’s problems, Harris says. “It’s imperative that we make sure every young person has access to these tools so they can address the problems of our future.”

Guerrilla campaign for tolerance takes to the streets of London ","After noticing signs of divisiveness and fear in recent weeks, one woman came up with a plan to prevent society sinking into intolerance. Turning to a traditional symbol of welcome, she took guerilla action on the streets of London
I am a dual American and British citizen, and the daughter of Venezuelan immigrants. Over the past year I’ve shed tears watching all my home countries – to put it lightly – lose it.
But in that time, I’ve also learned an important lesson: it’s not enough to hope that someone else will fix what’s broken. This planet is home to all of us, and it’s up to each of us to take responsibility, and action, for keeping it together. We cannot let society sink into divisiveness and intolerance.
So I decided to do something to help people feel welcome, wherever they are. I decided to launch a guerrilla campaign for kindness, tolerance and understanding. I called it A Welcome Thought.
I pulled together a group of friends and collaborators designers – artists and entrepreneurs – and on the Monday after the US election we put hundreds of place cards all over London, each with a simple message: “A place for…”
We cannot let society sink into divisiveness and intolerance
Everyone, you, immigrants, Muslims, cat lovers. The card can be addressed to anyone, by anyone.
It’s an invitation. After all, place cards are traditionally a symbol of welcome. These send a public message that everyone – of any race, creed or colour – belongs here. And they give people an easy way to help others feel more at home too: in local pubs, on public transport, anywhere that could be more welcoming. All anyone needs to participate is a sheet of paper, a printer, and this simple template to make their own place card, fill it in however they like and put it wherever they want.
It began as a small, humble project but it’s gaining momentum. Within a few days, people from across the UK, US, Canada, Germany, Greece and Zambia got in touch to get involved. Word is spreading on social media, and finding one ‘in the wild’ is a special moment. After stealthily leaving a few in cafes and shops, I’ve sat back and watched people smile or get a little teary, share it with their neighbor or fold it back up and drop it off at another table. One was left at the gate of Boris Johnson’s house as a reminder who this place is for. Everyone.
I know what it’s like to feel unwelcome, and luckily I haven’t felt it very often. My hope is that what started as hundreds of welcomes in one city turns into thousands all over the world – that a sense of belonging will spread across London and far beyond. Because to build a better future together, all of us need to feel we belong.

Meet the ‘place hackers’ reclaiming city spaces ","In the face of explosive urban development, there is new confidence about reclaiming public space for the people. We explore how cities became a playground for experimentation
Public spaces have been at the heart of cultural and community life for more than 2,500 years. The ancient Greeks designated certain squares as gathering places known as ‘agora’, while in classical Rome, you would head to ‘forums’ to take the temperature of political opinion.
As society’s ideas of governance have shifted, the concept of a ‘public city’ has also evolved. In many parts of the world, spaces historically assigned for social connection have vanished, often replaced by tower blocks: the glittering opaque glass of privatisation. And what has been the response to the loss of our lively streetscapes and hidden pockets of green? From London to Lebanon, spaces are being reclaimed.
Spaces historically assigned for social connection have vanished, often replaced by tower blocks: the glittering opaque glass of privatisation
Geographer David Harvey has described the freedom to make and remake our cities as “one of the most precious yet most neglected of our human rights”. Once the development of ‘urban regeneration’ has taken hold, streets and open spaces are redefined as private land.
The widespread privatisation – and monetisation – of space isn’t only about the removal of land from under our feet. Public space protection orders, introduced by the UK government in 2014, criminalise activities such as busking and rough sleeping within a mapped area. At the same time, green spaces are under threat. Though the Heritage Lottery Fund estimates that 34 million people in the UK regularly visit parks, 45 per cent of local authorities are considering selling them off.
Urban explorers
Social and cultural geographer Bradley Garrett believes that the erosion of public space is having an insidious effect on our wellbeing. “When you engineer public space out of cities, you make people feel unwelcome,” he explains. “Designing cities for corporations or investment banks – just as spaces for commodity flow – really undermines people’s ability to feel an attachment, a sense of place.”
Garrett’s interest in the public space movement started when he wrote a PhD thesis about ‘place hacking’ and urban explorers: people who venture into abandoned and derelict buildings. There are an estimated 420,000 cameras in London – roughly one for every 14 people. This statistic gave him a chill. “The more you trespass, the more it comes to the fore how the city is controlled; how surveillance measures stop us from doing certain things and cause us to monitor our behaviour,” he says.
Designing cities for corporations undermines people’s ability to feel attachment, a sense of place
“Place hacking is a response to a society of control. We need to know that we’re making a choice in our lives, otherwise we start suffering existentially. The act of trespassing, going out and creating the public city, gives you a sense of agency.”
Though London spaces are heavily controlled, the reclamation of privatised land has proved a fertile breeding ground for new and exciting collectives. In the colourful but increasingly gentrified streets of Dalston and Shoreditch, car parks, disused buildings and even alleyways have been repurposed as multifunctional spaces in the name of social connection.
Nomadic Community Gardens, with a site near Brick Lane in the East End, is a not-for-profit organisation aiming to transform disused urban spaces into gardens, allowing people to grow food, create art and share skills. Meanwhile, behind a wooden door on a busy high street hides the Dalston Eastern Curve Garden, resting on the tracks of the abandoned Eastern Curve railway line. The spot hosts vibrant workshops, talks and music nights. These “loose spaces”, as Garrett describes them, attract people from across the community who are keen to retain land for community benefit.

Down the road at Hive Dalston, (the Human Interest Versatile Environment), a former warehouse space is now under the guardianship of an entrepreneurial self-sustaining community. Hive’s wide-ranging but interconnected activities represent the diverse interests of residents, from “underprivileged artists to political activists, to hippies and homeless people,” explains director Joanna Jagusiak. Its many users have free rein to adapt the use of the space to best suit their needs.
One of the success stories is Phil, who regularly volunteers at the centre. “These guys looked out for me when they could have turned their backs,” he says, gesturing to his colleagues. Describing his efforts to recover from drug addiction and deal with mental health challenges, he adds: “The Hive is our church, where we come to be safe”.
Parklife reborn
If the disappearance of public space in London has been incremental, in some cities, such as Beirut, it has been swift and deliberate. Squares and parks have been openly overlooked in favour of corporate development. For 20 years the city’s largest green space, Horsh Beirut, lay abandoned. This was the result of years of corruption, delays and general indifference from local authorities, according to Mohamad Ayoub, executive director of Nahnoo, a youth-led organisation based in the city.
“The municipality, which is richer than the government itself, didn’t want to invest money into any public services,” he says. “It wasn’t a priority to serve the people.”
With no sign of official movement, those at Nahnoo explored what members of the public really wanted from the park, and presented a management plan to the authorities. After five years of discussions, the seemingly impossible dream became a reality, and Horsh Beirut opened part-time during winter 2015. Now the park is open full-time, and hosts the likes of concerts, yoga groups and family picnics.
“The city took its name from Horsh Beirut,” Ayoub explains. “So it’s not only a park, it’s connected to the memory of the people. Opening the park is like opening the city again.”
Elsewhere in Lebanon, the natural coastline has been all but obliterated by upscale development. Many believe this has come at the expense of public space and solidarity. According to Al Akhbar newspaper, 2.5 million square metres of the coast has been illegally privatised, with many resorts owned by senior politicians. Former transport minister Ghazi Aridi claimed in an Al Jazeera documentary that Beirut is “a country of total exploitation; a country with no shore”.
Still, a determined spirit remains. Artist Tania El Khoury is behind This Sea Is Mine, a project exploring public space and access to the sea. Part-protest, part-performance, she trod water in the ocean, almost invisible except for a sign asserting ‘this sea is mine’ in Arabic. El Khoury says it opened up a much-needed conversation about ownership: “The right to access the water when living in coastal cities should be respected and fought for.”

Disappearing heritage architecture is another source of inspiration for those seeking to make Beirut their own. Artist Tom Young is part of the endeavour to open the city’s abandoned mansions to the public. These include Villa Paradiso, which was transformed into a gallery in 2013. It will soon be the home of the ambassador for the European Commission in Lebanon, who will continue to host cultural events in the building. “I’m interested in opening places that have previously only been accessible to elites, so that people from all backgrounds have a sense of belonging to these precious places,” Young says.
Fringe benefits
In other parts of the world, social unrest and grassroots action have sparked the transformation of spaces. In Geylang, Singapore, peripheral areas outside the tightly regulated public domain held chances for sidelined communities to make themselves heard.
Joe Cai is founder of Geylang Adventures, a social enterprise helping local Singaporeans find common ground with migrant workers – a group on the very lowest of social rungs. For Cai, these fringes of urban turf were perfect spots from which to enact change. Speaking from Geylang, Singapore’s red light district, he says: “Gentrification is not as deep-rooted here as it is in other neighbourhoods. There is more flexibility to reclaim public space.”
In back alleys, open fields and fenced-off corners, Cai started a range of community-building programmes. He wanted to improve the lives of oppressed migrant workers, help Singaporeans better understand their experiences and shift negative perceptions of the area. One of his schemes, Back Alley Barbers, provides free haircuts for workers, while an alley dining experience called Hygge gathers strangers at a table for conversation on pertinent social issues. “Everyone listened to me as I shared my stories,” says Md Mukul, a migrant from Bangladesh. “After a while, it felt like I was back home speaking to them like my family.”

Back in the UK, Bradley Garrett, who once scaled the Shard in London in the name of research, insists there is a pressing need to reclaim space. “The top-down approach has failed,” he says. “We need direct action. Taking back space all the time – these are the answers,” he insists. “We should occupy public squares; we should install gardens. After a while, it becomes clear that the society of control is a fiction. That’s when the public city emerges.”

The project redirecting US election cash toward long-term progress ","Both Trump and Clinton’s presidential election campaigns have spent huge sums on advertising – up to $1m per day. What if this went to grassroots community groups working year-round on solutions instead?
“Grassroots organisations do not have an end date. They do not close shop until the next presidential election. Local, grassroots organisations work year-round to build power within the communities they serve.”
So says Karla Basta, director of donor organising at Movement 2016, a platform that helps large and small donors to improve the long-term social impact of their financial donations. Already, Basta and her colleagues have steered more than $2.5m to grassroots organisations in 16 ‘battleground’ states, and they want to boost this further by the time the dust settles on tomorrow: the day either Donald Trump of Hillary Clinton will take to the White House.
Rather than helping fund a presidential candidate, with donations being absorbed into a huge pot, Movement 2016 encourages people to give directly to grassroots organisations instead. It is these projects, working on the ground on the issues that really matter to people, that will have more impact, they believe.
Author Rebecca Solnit describes the presidential elections as a “form of madness” revisited once every four years. She writes: “They fit the great-man or -woman narrative of history, seducing us into forgetting how powerful we are. They erase our memory of grassroots power, direct democracy and civil society. Leaders beget followers; people pin their hopes on one person, and with that they seem to shed responsibility for anything beyond getting that one person into office.”
Our model is about supporting work that takes place 365 days a year, no matter what election cycle we may be in
While the sums of money involved are vast – Hillary Clinton’s campaign is thought to have spent $9.9m between 18-30 October and Trump’s $7.8m – much of this goes on the likes of TV advertisements. Though this sort of spending can seem all-important as election anticipation reaches fever pitch, it does little to build long-term social change, argues Basta.
The groups that Movement 2016 select to work with fit a strict social impact criteria, working in various ways toward a ‘movement of movements’ that might help underpin more fundamental social change.
“Our model is about supporting work that takes place 365 days a year, no matter what election cycle we may be in,” she says. “Movement 2016 groups are locally-driven and work on a range of social, economic and racial justice issues. During election season, these groups also register voters and make sure they get to the polls on election day. At the same time, they understand that real change happens over the long term, begins at the local level and that local victories create trends that influence federal policy.”
So how did Basta and her team choose which projects to work with?
Independent research helped narrow down the field, as did consulting with national networks of community-based organisations. “We were able to find groups in every state that work year-round on social, economic, immigrant, racial, and LGBTQ justice issues and have a proven track record of successful voter engagement and voter mobilisation,” says Basta. This year, Movement 2016 prioritised groups in certain key states – the likes of Florida and North Carolina – and those with open seats in the US Senate.
All manifestations of systemic oppression are in one way or another connected
Unlike the presidential candidates [Trump is worth around $3.7bn and Clinton estimated to be worth around $31m], grassroots groups often face day-to-day budgetary gaps. So what is the wider context of this project? How does Basta define what Canadian author, filmmaker and social activist Naomi Klein calls the ‘movement of movements’?
“It is the idea that all manifestations of systemic oppression are in one way or another connected,” Basta tells Positive News. “For example the treatment of undocumented immigrants is connected to the prison industrial complex, workers’ rights are connected to women’s equality, and so on. We aim to strengthen the movement of movements by strengthening the grassroots organisations empowering marginalised communities to fight against systems of oppression.”
And she notes several causes for optimism around this year’s election. “We are absolutely thrilled with the amount of early voting taking place. For example, there has been a huge spike in early voting by Hispanic people in Florida – one of the most critical battleground states,” says Basta.
“Overall, we’re excited that there have been lots of conversations about voting, not just in this election, but also during the mid-term elections. People seem to be catching on that we cannot ignore ballot races and pivotal battles being fought at the local level.”

As Trump attempts to woo Hindu Americans, young people respond with anti-hate campaign ","As Trump attempts to win votes from Hindu Americans, a group of young people have launched an ad campaign of their own, appealing to immigrant family members who might be considering voting for him
Speaking Hindi with a thick Indian American accent, Donald Trump filled the screen of a video advertisement. Condemning the 2008 Mumbai terrorist attacks and promising the Hindu and Indian community would have “a true friend in the White House” were he elected, the on-screen translation reads: “This time Trump government”. The 30-second video was carefully timed to coincide with Diwali celebrations unfolding up and down the country.
Some four million Indian Americans live in the US, according to 2015 census figures, forming one of the US’s most affluent ethnic groups. Parts of the community have expressed fears about extremist terrorism, something Trump has seized upon in trying to win their votes. And seeing some Indian Americans waving ‘Hindus for Trump’ signs at an anti-terrorism charity concert in New Jersey, his attempt to resonate with the community seemed to be working.
But Trump’s attempt to woo Hindu Americans was also answered by another ad campaign. Young Hindu Indian Americans launched the grassroots, independent #VoteAgainstHate campaign, urging older family members to reconsider casting their vote for the Republican nominee. Some think that Trump spreads a message of hate and have baulked against the suggestion that their community is aligned with his politics.
Our generation is growing up connected to the rest of the world, which affords us this amazing privilege of perspective
The video, which features some of Trump’s most controversial campaign trail soundbites as well as appearances by US actors Arjun Gupta, Sheetal Sheth and Utkarsh Ambudkar, suggests Trump may not be as sensible a candidate for presidency as he claims. The cast argue that Trump’s anti-Muslim stance, nativist tendencies and sometimes-erratic actions make him ill-suited to represent their relatives’ cross-cultural backgrounds.
“Please, please don’t be on the wrong side of history,” say the actors in the video as they address their family members directly, urging them to realise the significance of their votes.
“Like many people, me and the other creators of the video were getting really sick of all the negativity surrounding this election,” video director Doug Patterson told Positive News. “At the same time, we were realising that we all have people in our lives – good hearted people – who are actually going to vote for Donald Trump, simply because they identify as Republican.
“We were seeing really positive responses to some public service announcements while also reading statistics that said something like 20 per cent of Indian American voters were either undecided or leaning towards Republican. Trump had given us a lot to work with in making a case for why people shouldn’t vote for him, and at the same time, we wanted to do something that could empower the south Asian community.”
Those behind the #VoteAgainstHate campaign hope to highlight what they see as the hypocrisy at the heart of Trump’s attempts to woo Indian Americans: acknowledging on one hand that “generations of Hindu and Indian Americans have strengthened our country” while also urging strict immigration controls. While Trump has targeted Muslims specifically in his anti-extremism rhetoric, the mindset that comes with Islamophobia will negatively impact everyone in the south Asian community, believes Patterson.
We’ve had a lot of people reach out to tell us that the video affected them which is an amazing feeling
“The biggest concern is that many people in our country don’t have the drive or the means to step outside of what they know. They adopt their parents’ political views and don’t consider that maybe their parents were wrong about some things. We have to change the way people think,” he said.
“Our generation is growing up connected to the rest of the world, which affords us this amazing privilege of perspective. I can understand why our parents might be xenophobic, but if you were born in the 90s and you think we should build a wall around our country, then you’ve missed something along the way.”
So how is the video being received by family members?
“My parents are proud of me and admit that it’s powerful,” said Patterson, “but when I suggested posting it directly on a Trump-supporting second cousin’s Facebook wall, my mother bristled – she thinks it’s too confrontational. I hope that it’s worked on some. We’ve had a lot of people reach out to tell us that the video affected them which is an amazing feeling. I’ll tell you if I think it worked on 8 November – election day.”

A Glasgow welcome ","Ostracised throughout Europe for centuries, Roma immigrants are finding Glasgow more welcoming. Education and trust-building are at the heart of the city’s attempts at cultural integration
Young girls in red and black satin dresses have adorned their hair with yellow and orange flowers. Some make offerings of posies to passersby. Others wave placards declaring: ‘Glasgow loves Roma’ and ‘Defend Roma Rights’. Scotland’s largest city is commemorating International Roma Day.
It’s quite a contrast to 2007, when Roma teenagers recently-arrived from eastern Europe, fought running street battles with Scottish and Pakistani youth, spurred on by racist slurs. As I reported that year, Roma from Slovakia who had come to Glasgow in search of jobs were called ‘beggars’ and ‘thieving gypsies’, sworn at and told to “go back home”. A decade on, things aren’t always harmonious, but one of the world’s most marginalised ethnic groups has been steadily finding acceptance in Glasgow, helped in part by the city’s commitment to education.
“It’s really important that we support those who choose to come and live here, to integrate, to contribute to the community and to be part of the community,” Scotland’s first minister Nicola Sturgeon said at a Govanhill event to mark the Roma celebrations. “If we work together, there are no challenges we cannot overcome.”
Joining Sturgeon in addressing the crowd was Marcela Adamova, a Romany woman originally from Slovakia. She had flown in from Hungary, where she’s completing a postgraduate diploma in public administration, following a BA in community development at Glasgow University. Now 35, Adamova has been a vocal advocate for Roma rights in Scotland for several years, and she is keen to return to the city when she finishes her diploma.
After arriving in Glasgow in 2007, Adamova worked for charities and then in the health service, before beginning her studies. “If I had not decided to come here I would never have finished university. I would not be where I am now,” she reflects. “Glasgow gave me the opportunity to change my life.”
Adamova cites access to education as the key to real representation for Glasgow’s Roma community: “We need more people with university degrees, not only activists working on Roma issues, we need doctors and lawyers. We need more intelligentsia.
“I think that in general, Roma people have equal opportunities to education in Glasgow, though more could be done. I believe that things will change for the next generation.”
Her assessment echoes the findings of an international conference held in Glasgow a few weeks earlier, where delegates traded ideas on supporting Roma integration. The city’s approach to embracing cultural diversity with an emphasis on education is earning it a reputation for progress.
“In Slovakia it is not like this,” Adamova explains. “When I was younger my parents told me: ‘It’s for your own good not to say you’re Roma, or your life will be difficult’,” she said. “But here, it was OK, it was fine to say ‘I’m Roma’.”
Glasgow gave me the opportunity to change my life
The Roma are an ethnic group of around 10 to 12 million people with Indian roots, reflected in their official symbol, the chakra: a sixteen-spoked wheel. Historians think they first travelled west from the Punjab more than 1,000 years ago. Today, they are scattered in nations across Europe. Often demonised by and excluded from mainstream society, Roma have suffered persecution for centuries, most grotesquely at the hands of the Nazis. An estimated 500,000 Roma were murdered in the second world war because they were deemed an inferior race.
Widespread discrimination continues in many nations, from France to Slovakia, Serbia, Romania and the Czech Republic.
Scotland has also been shamed by racist attitudes. Yet the violence in 2007 – albeit an isolated outbreak – ultimately led to action by Glasgow City Council and local residents, who wanted to preserve Govanhill’s racial harmony.
Home to a large Asian community, Govanhill is one of the most culturally diverse parts of Scotland and, despite the odd racially linked incident over the decades, the area was, and still is, proud of its social cohesion. Steeped in socialism, tolerance is widely promoted throughout Glasgow, and many of the 3,500 or so Roma who live here seem to be settling in well.
During the celebrations, I overhear several young people speaking English as well as Romany, a sign that a new generation is embracing education, a right that’s often been denied in other parts of Europe.
A primary objective for the council has been to build trust with Romany people. It offered free health care and established specialist teams, involving members of the Roma community, to address employment issues and social care. But the long-term plan is focused on education. To address language barriers, for example, the council employed two Slovakians to work with local schools.
There are now 600 Roma children in Glasgow’s schools, mostly in Govanhill, where more than 30 languages are spoken in an area of less than two square miles. Close to Govanhill is Shawlands Academy, a secondary school with around 150 pupils from eastern Europe. In fact, the school hosts students from right around the world, with around 60 first languages spoken by its students.
In her office at the school, assistant headteacher Jan McCauley introduces 15-year-old Stefan Durko and Valeria Gombarova, aged 16. Both are Slovakian Roma. They came to Scotland from the city of Michalovce, and, according to McCauley, are among the cream of her fourth year pupils. “This boy is exceptionally talented in music,” she says of Stefan, adding that he could be one of the first of Shawlands’ pupils from eastern Europe to sit school-leaving Higher exams.
A self-taught musician, Stefan says he wants to the opportunity become a music teacher. “My father used to travel and play with his band in different countries,” the teenager tells me.“He played the accordion and so do I, although I play lots of instruments.”
Valeria aspires to be a fashion designer but says she’d also like to work with computers. “It was really scary when I came to Scotland because everything changed,” she recalls. “But I got used to it. I had to learn English quickly.”
Both pupils say that Scotland has offered them opportunities they would never have enjoyed in Slovakia, but Stefan feels that the media demonises Romany people: “Sometimes reporters talk about us like we’re trash,” he says. “This gets me mad.”
“They also mix us up with Romanian people,” Valeria chimes in, voicing another frustration.
McCauley says Shawlands works hard to connect with the Roma community and that local primary schools have also been pro-active in building trust. While misconceptions linger and undoubtedly, pockets of tension remain, my conversations with people throughout the community do point to a new generation of genuine multiculturalism.
On the way out, we stop to admire a mural, made to celebrate the 2014 Commonwealth Games, held in Glasgow. Slovakian and Polish students helped design the colourful mosaic, which is framed by the words ‘integrity, equality, respect and compassion’.
Words like these are easy enough to spell out, but in a city that’s becoming a model for cultural integration, they seem refreshingly appropriate.

Business with social conscience can help steer Brexit solutions ","Agile social enterprises are well placed to help smooth the way forward in our alien post-Brexit landscape, suggests Peter Holbrook
If we take the mainstream media’s word on Brexit, it seems we are a divided Britain. Looking about, it’s pretty difficult to disagree. Those who voted to remain are largely depressed and anxious about the future, while those who voted to leave are looking forward to the country “taking back control” and prospering.
For some people, electing to leave was a protest vote — discontentment, disillusionment, and distrust in experts and the establishment put rocket boosters under the Brexit campaign. Of course, some people voted to leave because they genuinely believe that our economy will be stronger as a result.
But the EU was an easy scapegoat for media moguls, politicians and business leaders who wanted out — a handy peg on which to hang a plethora of complex, interrelated social and economic problems. That’s not to say that the EU is beyond blame: the forcing of austerity measures on countries already in recession has been harsh to say the least, while David Cameron’s calls for reform fell on deaf ears.
Now that Theresa May’s government has begun the unenviable task of negotiating the UK’s withdrawal, I suspect those who voted to leave will find that exiting the EU does little — and possibly the opposite — of what they have been led to expect.
I doubt we can expect our neglected high streets to suddenly bustle once again, our shuttered pubs to spring back to life; for Britain to return, newly powerful, as a nation of shopkeepers — a manufacturing powerhouse with widespread job security. And there’s little hope of resolving the mythical issue of migrants taking our council homes, school places, NHS resources and jobs.
Because of course, these challenges, incorrectly posed as EU-membership threats, are actually the consequences of globalisation.
Capitalism and globalisation are built on the myth that you can have it all: ever-increasing opportunity, living standards and life expectancy, along with ever-cheaper products. Globalisation may offer people cheap TVs, but it also strips their communities of power, hope and job security.
Undemocratic and distant, the EU has too often been globalisation’s cheerleader, advocate and agent. However wrong, it is somewhat understandable that some people blame the EU for such issues as economic instability and unemployment.
Either way, where do we go from here? One thing is certain: Brexit is shrouded in uncertainties. Who knows how it will play out. Political leaders are only just beginning talks and the extraction will likely move at a snail’s pace.
Seeking new beginnings
But amid the speculation of what the future holds, it is crucial that social enterprises are first out of the blocks to make the most of the opportunities Brexit may present.
Social enterprises, or businesses that equally prioritise profit and social benefit, can help address the range of challenges facing Britain. They are inherently equipped to solve wicked problems and fill the gaps in business and society; social enterprises are perfectly placed to offer solutions to Brexit problems we are only just beginning to comprehend.
In one creative example, the social enterprise Street League tackles youth unemployment through football. Working with 16-25 year olds who are not in employment, education and training, it provides a structured football and education ‘academy’ programme, that develops vital employability skills such as communication, teamwork and goal-setting. Bevan Healthcare CIC runs a much-needed NHS service for people who are homeless or in unstable accommodation, including asylum seekers, while social enterprises like Bounce Back, provide education and training to people in prison, helping them reintegrate into society. These are forward-looking, long-term solutions to building stronger communities.
While some funding streams will close as a result of Brexit, others could well open. There may well be new rules — and opportunities — for procurement and government grants. This could mean chances for established, emerging and brand new social enterprises to build their businesses and help more Brits.
Of course, there will be fierce competition for available funds. Social enterprises will need to build relationships with funders and funding bodies, and be clear about how they can help people and communities prosper. They will, as ever, need to provide social impact proof through measuring and reporting.
While one in seven UK-based social enterprises currently exports their goods and services, the majority trade within the UK. Brexit presents a golden chance to encourage more people to get behind British social enterprises’ products and services.
Have your say
Social Enterprise UK (SEUK), the national body and, full disclosure here, my employer too, hopes that policymakers will help the social enterprise sector successfully navigate Brexit’s turbulence as well as leverage its possibilities. To facilitate this, SEUK is conducting a survey to identify social enterprises’ Brexit views. The results will be used to help plan social enterprises’ next steps. If you work in the sector, we would appreciate your input.
While the survey results are being collated, Westminster might wish to take its lead from the Scottish government, which in its latest economic strategy committed to pursuing inclusive growth to achieve “the two mutually supportive goals of increasing competitiveness and tackling inequality”.
While Brexit holds much potential for social enterprises, initial signs show it also presents plenty of hurdles. For example, the Office for Civil Society (OCS), which was once in the Cabinet Office, has been somewhat oddly plonked in the Department for Culture, Media & Sport (DCMS) in the post-referendum reshuffle. It goes without saying that, without social enterprises proactively developing relationships and a high profile within this portfolio, this positioning carries risk for the social enterprise sector’s future.
Social enterprises are businesses and need to be recognised as such, especially as the government is exploring how it can support the traditional small-to-medium enterprises in the face of Brexit. This is not a time for social enterprises and investors to be sidelined. Nor is it a time for social enterprises to be meek. Brexit presents challenges and turmoil, but it also represents an unrivalled opportunity for innovative, agile, solutions-focused social enterprises to lead the way.

Shining a light on ProgrExit possibilities ","Although uncertain and scary, Brexit offers a thrill of progressive possibility
Like many people, I was shocked and dismayed by both the Brexit referendum result and the absence of any plan for how an EU exit might actually happen. In the shell-shocked days that followed the result, I soaked up as many of the legions of doom-and-gloom articles as I could. But then I came across something that helped me look at things differently. The Guardian’s Paul Mason was calling for a ‘ProgrExit’:
“We can and must fight to place social justice and democracy at the heart of the Brexit negotiations,” he wrote.
I promptly adopted this post-Brexit portmanteau — both the ProgrExit word and the thinking behind it — and began considering ways we could master this progressive, positive EU exit. Mason’s article reminded me that all the UK had voted for was an exit; it hasn’t voted for any particular kind of exit, or for the values and principles on which it would be based.
Britain could, after all, be reshaped as a more sustainable, equitable and resilient nation, modelling a completely renewable energy grid. It could become a home to thriving and diverse food economies. It could meet its housing needs through affordable, appealing homes owned by the community. And it could support its citizens by creating a range of sustainable job opportunities that benefit people, the economy and the environment. With ambition it is all possible.
Britain could be reshaped as a more sustainable, equitable and resilient nation
Romania, for example, recently passed a law to require all supermarkets to stock a minimum of 51 per cent locally sourced produce, a move that will foster new infrastructure, a new culture of enterprise and possibly even a public health revolution for Romania. I can’t help but think: how could we create similarly innovative solutions?
With this in mind, I was very taken with Robin McAlpine’s Brexit analysis. You may not like the result, he wrote, and you may be scared of what comes next, “But on the other hand, can’t you feel a bit of the ‘thrill of possibility’?” Flagging the inevitable sameness and absence of any real social or political change had David Cameron and co. been returned, McAlpine asked: “And isn’t there something energising about having real, achievable tasks to hand?”
To answer these questions, we need to ask: what is it that the people we share this island with, live with, work with and are related to actually long for? It’s a big word, longing. The Oxford Dictionary defines it as “a yearning desire”. For despite claims that xenophobia influenced people’s leave votes, very few people, in their deepest of hearts, truly long for a country that abuses migrants, that concentrates wealth in the pockets of the elites, or is inward-looking, closed and suspicious. That’s not who they are. Not really.
I know people who voted to leave. They’re not the monsters the post-Brexit slanging matches would have us believe. They’re good people. They are respectful and kind. They work for the wellbeing of the places in which they live. Whether voting to stay or go, people long for many of the same things: for beauty, for companionship, for feeling part of something, for their children to have more opportunities than they had, for a sense of things being fair.
By pursuing a ProgrExit that addresses real longing rather than getting bogged down in numbers and economic forecasts that obscure our basic motivations and desires, we can steer this outcome towards something uniting, something wholesome. For example, when we consider our real longings, why would we vote for the mass rollout of unaffordable, bland, identical housing that channels money into a few hands when we could have community-owned developments that benefit both occupants and the environment?
I know people who voted to leave. They’re not the monsters the post-Brexit slanging matches would have us believe. They’re good people.
Why would we support the vast, environmentally questionable money pits of nuclear power or fracking when we could provide clean energy and savings to communities? Why would we allow what remains of our independently owned economies, with their long history and connections to local families and culture, to be swept away by superstores and Starbucks when a more vibrant, diverse local economy is so much more enriching?
Yes, people need jobs, houses, energy, security. But it seems increasingly obvious that a transition-type approach — a community-led shift to sustainable local economies — scaled up and with political support, would meet those needs better. Far better.
A transition approach could bring people together and help build common ground, especially when it comes to issues that transcend borders. Climate change, for instance, is accelerating at a terrifying pace. Worldwide, the temperature for the first half of 2016 was the hottest since recordkeeping began in 1880, and June marked the 14th consecutive month the temperature record had been broken. Building common ground to address such a complex and wide-reaching issue is crucial and urgent. A ProgrExit could provide an effective and timely means of doing so.
Of course, there are some unpleasant truths about the Brexit result that need to be acknowledged. One side effect is that some people have been emboldened to be speak and behave in openly discriminatory ways. We need to feel similarly emboldened. We need to talk about the kind of world we want to see and to challenge racism and xenophobia wherever and whenever we encounter it.
People are doing this. A Huntingdon man responded to the ‘go home’ letters that had been posted through many Polish residents’ doors with ones that simply read “You are welcome here”.
There are many people across the country working to build common ground, along with community and jobs. They are initiatives from which a ProgrExit approach could learn. These include Brixton Energy, a not-for-profit co-operative renewable energy project that provides training and employment; Billinge & Orrell’s Greenslate Farm, which has reinvigorated a disused farm and brought it into community ownership and Transition Fishguard, which uses food that would otherwise go to waste to provide healthy meals to low-income families. Transition Homes in Totnes is building affordable, environmentally friendly homes by and for its members. And so on. And so on. And so on.
So while it’s easy to dwell on the Brexit negatives — and believe me, I initially did — it’s more useful to concentrate on its positives and possibilities. Writer Anne Lamott once wrote: “Lighthouses don’t go running all over an island looking for boats to save; they just stand there shining.” So shine on, you crazy transitioners and changemakers of all hues and persuasions. Shine harder than you have ever shone before and let’s ensure the Brexit is a ProgrExit.

Cleaning up: domestic workers claim their rights ","Despite some 67 million people worldwide earning their living through domestic labour, their working rights have long been overlooked. But things are changing
In early 2014, a 22-year-old Indonesian woman named Erwiana Sulistyaningsih was found, half-starved and crippled by festering wounds, in the futuristic glass and steel departure terminal of Hong Kong international airport.
It was the end of an eight-month ordeal that had begun when Sulistyaningsih arrived in Hong Kong to work as a maid. During that time, her employer beat her savagely, forced her to work 21-hour shifts, withheld her pay, and fed her just bread and rice. It was only when Sulistyaningsih’s failing health left her unable to work that she was released, with a few dollars and a plane ticket back to Indonesia.
Such stories are all too common: the International Labour Organisation (ILO) estimates that more than 67 million people worldwide earn their living by cooking, cleaning and caring for others, often without the basic protections extended to most workers. Of those, about 80 per cent are women and at least 11.5 million are migrants, with many living in precarious and isolated situations that make them easy targets for abuse.
We’re seeing a very fast movement towards the recognition of rights for migrant domestic workers
Gradually, though, things are changing. In Hong Kong, Sulistyaningsih’s story sparked mass demonstrations, leading to the jailing of her former employer and an overhaul of domestic employment laws. The uproar also helped unify the city’s 320,000 foreign domestic helpers and made them more aware of their rights, says Elizabeth Tang, general secretary for the Hong Kong-based International Domestic Workers Federation.
Stories similar to Sulistyaningsih’s are unfolding around the world, with abuse still widespread. But, according to Tang, at least half a million domestic workers are now fighting for their rights through unions and grassroots campaigns. “Slowly, very slowly, things are getting fixed,” she says.
In much of the Middle East, for instance, one-sided immigration systems give employers sweeping powers over migrant employees. But collective action by domestic workers is beginning to bear fruit.
Domestic workers in Lebanon defied government warnings in 2015 to launch a pioneering trade union to advocate for their rights. In Jordan, domestic workers formed a network to defend their rights and have established legal clinics to tackle abusive employers. And in Kuwait last year, pressure from both migrants and citizens led to the passing of the Arab world’s first law to explicitly grant rights to domestic workers.
“Kuwait’s law has been incredibly important not just for Kuwait itself, but for the region as a whole,” says Human Rights Watch researcher Rothna Begum. While the details remain hazy, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates are now drafting similar laws, Begum notes.

Legislative changes are also in the pipeline in the UK, where controversial rules currently bar some migrant domestic workers from leaving their employers. A sharply critical Home Office review published in December 2015 should spur the government to scrap the rules, says Kate Roberts, head of policy at advocacy charity Kalayaan.
“If the report’s recommendations are implemented it will dramatically improve the situation for domestic workers in the UK,” she says.
Meanwhile in the US, domestic workers have allied with unions to stage well-organised protests demanding labour reforms. So far five states, including New York, Oregon and California, have passed ‘bills of rights’ for domestic workers.
“We want domestic workers to be recognised as workers with rights,” explains Silvia Gonzalez, a Mexican immigrant working as a cleaner in Washington state. “Domestic work should be seen as a respectable job, just like being a lawyer, or doctor, or journalist.”
Such efforts received a boost in 2013, when an ILO convention cataloguing the fundamental rights of domestic workers went into force. So far only 22 nations have ratified the convention. But having a clear framework in place has created pressure for change and helped mobilise campaigners around the world, says Maria Elena Valenzuela, chief technical advisor for the ILO’s Global Action Programme on Migrant Domestic Workers.
Domestic work should be seen as a respectable job, just like being a lawyer, doctor, or journalist
“There’s been a huge change,” she says. “We’re seeing a very fast movement towards the recognition of rights for migrant domestic workers.”
And when countries do protect domestic workers, their neighbours often follow suit. Much of Latin America has now ratified the ILO convention, for instance, while post-apartheid efforts to help South Africa’s million-plus domestic workers inspired similar actions in Namibia, Zimbabwe and Tanzania.
The next step is to join the dots between individual local campaigns and forge a genuinely global movement. Labour leaders say they are working to internationalise their campaigns, and #OurHands, a global social media campaign to inform domestic workers of their rights co-run by Christian Aid and Migrant Forum in Asia (MFA), received a strong response.
“We’re learning from each other,” says MFA programme coordinator Agnes Matienzo-Peralta. “It’s a long road, but we’re optimistic.”
Many migrant workers continue to face abuse on a daily basis, and even countries that have passed protections often struggle to adequately enforce them. Still, campaigners say the solidarity and momentum they have built up in recent years gives them real hope for the future. “We need to stick together,” says Gonzalez, the Mexican migrant worker.
“We need to keep women informed and fighting for their rights… because when we fight, we win.”

Residence: Seattle, US
Everyone in Guatemala thinks of America as a land of opportunity, but when I came here in 2000, the dream became a nightmare. I was a live-in cleaner in a big house in New York, in the fancy bit of Long Island, working 16 hours a day for $400 (£276) a month, with just a few hours off on Sunday. After three months I asked for my money, and my employer said he’d used it to pay for my food. I should have left, but I was very isolated, and I didn’t speak the language. When I finally quit after three years, my employer owed me $4,000 (£2,760). I never got that money.
I speak up and demand my rights, and expect people to respect me
I moved in with my sister in Seattle, and I met other immigrants and domestic workers through a group called Casa Latina. There I heard a lot of talk about justice, rights and fair wages and dignity for all workers. That changed things for me, and I have a different experience now. I still work as a cleaner, but I speak up and demand my rights, and expect people to respect me. I’m working with Casa Latina to make sure other people in my position know their rights too. I want to continue fighting for others. When I work to make things better here in the US, I feel like I’m contributing something for all domestic workers. This is my passion now. We have to take action, and change our reality.

I moved to South Africa in 2008. I made the decision because we were facing a lot of political pressure in Zimbabwe. We were told to vote for Mugabe in the election, but we wanted to vote for the MDC [Movement for Democratic Change] party. They threatened to hurt us and burn down our house. I had six children, so I was frightened. I moved to Cape Town because there is a Zimbabwean community and my aunt lived there. But it is lonely, because I don’t have many friends.
Finding work here isn’t hard, but it is if you don’t know anyone. I don’t have an education, but I know how to clean. I used to go to a street where people are picked for day work. But when I went there, South Africans would tell me to go back where I came from.
I don’t have an education, but I know how to clean
There is a lot of crime here, more than in Zimbabwe. We’ve been robbed three times. If something happens to us, the South Africans won’t stand up for us like they do for each other. They don’t like us, they say we steal their jobs. But we are hard-working.
I got my first steady domestic job in 2013, and things have been getting better since then. I work every day and my children go to school. My daughter just graduated matric [matriculation/high school], and is looking at university. I don’t think she would have done that in Zimbabwe. When my youngest was in school in Zimbabwe, there weren’t any teachers. Now, I hope they can all get an education.

EU: In or out? ","With a historic vote looming on 23 June, Brits remain divided over whether the UK should stay in the EU. Some believe a ‘Brexit’ would cut through red tape clogging the British economy and give Westminster more control. Others insist our ties to Europe profoundly shape Britain’s workforce, trade and culture for the better. Here, an expert offers a perspective to reframe the debate and we crunch the numbers to help inform your view
“Whatever the outcome, free movement is not the problem”
Both sides of the EU debate have misrepresented the issue of free movement across the Eurozone, argues EU law and policy expert Charlotte O’Brien
The free movement of workers between member states is one of the EU’s fundamental principles. It’s also perhaps the most controversial component of the UK’s referendum debate, and arguably the most misrepresented.
Those on the ‘Brexit’ side, in favour of Britain leaving the EU, speak against the principle of free movement, suggesting that we need to stem the flow of people from EU member countries arriving to live and work in Britain. The theory goes that the UK cannot cope with current migratory flows from the EU, and that EU national workers threaten labour market stability and public finances, taking jobs away from Brits, and placing an undue burden on their public systems.
But those in favour of continued EU membership have not mounted a strong counter argument in favour of free movement. They have steered clear of this emotive topic, pointing instead to trade benefits. This appears to accept that free movement is a necessary evil; a concession made in exchange for the economic bounty that union membership provides.
The perception that the free movement of workers is a drain upon public resources, albeit one accepted in order to access other trade advantages, has gained traction. Successive government announcements have reinforced it, telling us that welfare changes made in 2014 and 2015 tackled ‘rogue’ EU benefit claims, and that migrants were taking advantage of or exploiting the system. And the European Commission itself has entrenched it, agreeing with British representatives that free movement to the UK puts “an excessive pressure on the proper functioning of its public services”, and that the current situation justifies a ‘benefit brake’.
Public services are under pressure, but this is likely to have more to do with austerity than the presence of Europeans
Both sides of the debate, and the EU institutions themselves, are feeding a fundamental misunderstanding. Here’s why: the free movement of workers is an economic dimension of the EU. The union was not set up as a charitable endeavour, whereby member states got their slice of trade pie by promising to sponsor hard-up non-nationals. Rather, in the free movement framework, workers are viewed instrumentally, as a way to promote economic integration and free trade. The rights of workers, such as equal treatment, were not social ends in themselves, they were the lubricant that ensured labour mobility. That is, people can – and willingly do – move where the work is.
The idea that we should be cherry picking and abandoning free movement of workers while maintaining the economic ties with the common market is flawed. Labour mobility serves the economic interests of the members of the union.
A range of studies, including by the European Commission and the UK government, which commissioned, then buried, its own Balance of Competences review, point to EU nationals being net contributors to the UK economy. The reports show EU nationals have a positive fiscal impact – possibly to a greater extent than UK citizens themselves, since EU nationals are less likely than UK citizens to be unemployed. A University College London study found that European Economic Area nationals contributed ten per cent more than native Brits to the economy, in relative terms, from 1995 to 2011.
Contrary to perceptions, free movement is not to blame for the UK’s woes. Public services are under pressure, but this is likely to have more to do with austerity than the presence of Europeans. Free movement is not a scheme based on altruism, and we flatter ourselves if we think otherwise.

New issue of Positive News magazine offers serious optimism ","Illustrator Noma Bar produces iconic illustrated cover for Positive News magazine, as part of its perspective-shifting approach
The latest edition of Positive News magazine, featuring a striking cover illustration by Noma Bar, reaches members and shop shelves this week, showcasing intelligent journalism about positive developments worldwide.
The issue’s cover story explores the progress being made for the world’s estimated 67 million domestic workers, and is accompanied by a trademark ’double take’ image by the Israeli-born illustrator.
Bar’s award-winning work has appeared in books and publications around the world, including the New York Times and the Guardian. His distinctive, deceptively-simple style made him a fitting collaborator for Positive News, a magazine that fuses rigorous journalism about progress and possibility with inspiring, beautiful design.
Positive News editor-in-chief, Seán Dagan Wood, said: “In the same way that our constructive journalism offers a different mindset and a different lens on important issues, Noma Bar’s illustrations are also perspective-shifting.
“For our cover story we wanted to reveal how migrant domestic workers worldwide are improving their lives and opportunities, while highlighting the exploitation they still face. Noma’s cover does that by immediately engaging the reader in a positive way, through the colours and imagery, while in the detail revealing the human struggle in the story.
“Having rebranded and launched our new magazine at the start of the year, we wanted a strong follow-up to the relaunch issue. Working with Noma, who provided such an iconic illustrated cover for us, was the perfect way to do it.”
The brief worked well with Bar’s style of illustration, which strives to show the people hidden behind well-known objects and subjects. “That was what I wanted to communicate” said Bar, “the human behind everyday scenarios that are invisible to everyone.”
I wanted to communicate the human behind everyday scenarios that are invisible to everyone
Across 84 carefully-designed pages, the 2016 second-quarter issue of Positive News explores a diverse range of subjects through the magazine’s solutions-focused lens. It includes a look at advances made by those in the transgender community, how social inclusion rather than punishment is working to tackle drug abuse, and how society’s relationship with possessions could be evolving into something more fulfilling.
In the Constructive Conversation, one of the magazine’s new regular sections, two thought leaders are challenged to find common ground, this time on whether a basic income could help create a fairer society. And in line with a desire to go beyond headlines that come and go, the What Happened Next? section returns to stories reported previously to track how things have developed since.
The edition also introduces the theme of #seriousoptimism, in line with Positive News’ testament that good journalism can be about good things – that rigorous reporting does not necessarily have to spell doom and gloom. It is the second edition designed by London-based Studio Blackburn, the same creative force behind Positive News’ rebrand. The agency is now working with the magazine’s editorial team to forge a new path of magazine design and constructive content.
Paul Blackburn from Studio Blackburn said: “In this, the second magazine that we’ve designed for Positive News, we feel that we’ve raised the bar and expanded the scope of what we can do with it. It’s great to have been able to put Noma Bar’s unique talent to worthy and appropriate use – and to hopefully demonstrate to other creatives the opportunities out there to work with Positive News.”
The relaunch, in January 2016, took place after Positive News became the first global media co-operative financed through crowdfunding. Following its 30-day #OwnTheMedia campaign in July 2015, it is now co-owned by 1,526 readers, journalists and supporters from 33 countries. The £263,000 investment raised by the ‘community share offer’, is enabling Positive News to roll out a new business model. The aim is to grow its reach and make the print and digital publication financially sustainable long-term, with the move to a magazine just one part of this.

Getting to the root of cultural understanding in Brussels ","In multicultural areas of the Belgian capital, an education project is drawing on family history to foster understanding and integration. Veronique Mistiaen investigates
“For me the most moving moment is when children turn their [family] trees upside down and the roots become branches – branches that will help them grow and blossom,” says Racines founder Vinciane Hanquet.
Racines (or Roots) is a Belgium-based multicultural school programme that helps pupils trace their family history. Through activities such as building a genealogical tree, drawing migration maps and collecting stories and mementos from family members, they discover and learn to value their identity.
A teacher with 40 years of experience, Hanquet wanted a tool that would both help children feel more comfortable with who they are and be more understanding of people from different backgrounds.
This work is particularly important in a country with a high rate of migration, she says. Belgium has an estimated migration rate of 5.9 migrants per 1,000 people – the 21st highest in the world. “We discover that if our own trees blossom under the Belgian sun, or rain, our roots extend under all continents. If a child is proud of himself, his family and his culture, he is more likely to accept other children. And if a child discovers other children’s history, she will respect them more and get to see differences as richness.”
One of the first schools involved in the project was St Ursule in Molenbeek – the low-socioeconomic Brussels district recently depicted by the media as a breeding ground for terrorism.
“Considering the heavy current events, it seems very important that this type of project takes place in our schools. Let’s get to know and understand one another!” says St Ursule’s teacher Anne Van Laer, who completed the project with one year six class. Most of Van Laer’s students are from migrant backgrounds.
We believe that it will lead to a better knowledge of oneself, a cultural openness and a better understanding between people from different backgrounds
“I remember the pride with which some students composed their family portrait, showing all the trips there had been – the departure from Morocco, the arrival in Belgium, finding work and only then bringing the family in,” says Véronique Guévar. She ran the project with her year five class in a Brabant Wallon school last year. “Even if there was no migration, everyone has a story. We learn things about each other, and this breaks the ice. We feel no longer alone.”
Hanquet has introduced Racines to more than 20 primary schools in Brussels and the Wallonia region, and some 1,000 children were involved in the programme in 2015 alone.
The project links easily to many curriculum topics, including history, geography, writing, public speaking and languages. Teachers can adapt it according to their needs, but they all begin with an ascending tree, starting with the child, then branching out to their parents, grandparents and great-grandparents – spanning about 100 years of history.
Over two to four months, the pupils interview family members and collect documents including ID cards, birth certificates, letters and photos. They gather evocative objects such as jewellery, pieces of clothing, recipes and musical instruments. They also anchor their roots in time, charting their family history in relation to major historical events. In the process, they explore the evolution of communication, transport, leisure, fashion, food and culture across the generations.
“This project has sparked communication in families who don’t usually talk about themselves and who keep their life journeys more or less taboo,” says Van Laer.
“I think it’s important to know my roots,” says Yen, a student who has participated in the programme. “For me, from Cambodia, I have learned to know my grandparents who still live there… I communicated with them on the internet.”
Racines is generating interest in Belgium and abroad, but so far it is surviving on short-term grants and Hanquet’s and other teachers’ passion and energy. There has not yet been any formal evaluation of the programme, and it is difficult to assess its long-term impact as students have moved to secondary school. But many teachers, families and pupils recognise it can foster self-esteem and integration.
“We are confident that this project will have a positive impact not only on children, but also on adults,” says Ilir Strazimiri, director of St Dominique primary school in Schaerbeek, another multicultural district of Brussels. His team is so enthusiastic about the project that they have decided to run it across all their primary school year groups this year. He says: “We believe that it will lead to a better knowledge of oneself, a cultural openness and a better understanding between people from different backgrounds.”

The Catalan language once banned is now thriving ","Catalan was banned during the Franco-era, but the language survived and now the Spanish region could be closer than ever to gaining independence
Barcelona is one of the best-known cities in the world, yet visitors expecting to practice their Spanish can often be surprised when they hear Catalan spoken in the streets. The language has had a troubled history, but is a key marker of identity in Catalonia, a region where many hope for independence from Spain. The outcome of regional elections on September 27 means the current Catalan president Artur Mas may now seek to declare independence.
Attempts to suppress the Catalan language and culture have deep historical roots but were intensified during the era of Francisco Franco. The dictator banned the Catalan language from public spaces and made Spanish the sole language of public life.
For 40 years under the dictatorship, Spain tried to present itself as an ethnically and politically homogeneous state. The execution of Franco’s opponents continued after the end of the Spanish Civil War. One prominent victim was the former Catalan president, Lluís Companys who was deported from Nazi-occupied France in 1940 and then executed in Barcelona.
Cultural repression
After the Spanish Civil War ended in 1939, the repression was not only political but cultural too. Catalan institutions were suppressed and Catalan was banned in the school system. Indicative of the new political order were statements from the authorities, the police in particular, such as “Hable el idioma del imperio”: use the language of the empire.
The immediate consequence was that Catalonia lost many of the material resources for the production and reproduction of its culture. The Catalan language lost prestige in comparison with Spanish, and some upper-class Catalans began to start speaking more Spanish.
At the same time, between one and two million people from the south of Spain moved into Catalonia after the 1950s. These migrants were sometimes prejudiced against the Catalan language, not least because many of them did not even know about its existence before coming to Catalonia. Some felt no need to learn Catalan. This is the kind of problem which faces all stateless nations.

Despite this, most Catalan people went on using their language at home and the language has survived against the odds. Paradoxically, other languages such as Irish have had a state to protect them in the 20th century and yet it has proved difficult to stop the erosion of the language.
With the death of Franco in 1975, and once democratic freedoms had been recovered, the 1978 constitution recognised linguistic plurality and established that Spanish languages other than Castilian could be official languages of the state. Catalan is now compulsory in Catalonian schools.
A living language
Catalan is spoken in Catalonia, but also in the Balearic Islands, in parts of Valencia, in Andorra, in the French province of Roussillon, and in the Italian city of Alghero. Overall, it is spoken in a territory that contains more than 13m inhabitants.
More than 150 universities in the world teach Catalan and more than 400 journals are published in the language. Ironically, Catalan studies are only weakly represented in Spanish universities, reflecting both the historical discrimination against Catalan and contemporary concerns about the drive for independence in Catalonia. Only seven universities in Spain (outside Catalonia) teach and research Catalan, whereas 22 universities offer courses in the UK, 20 French higher education institutions offer Catalan Studies, as do 24 in the US.
Catalan is the ninth language in Europe in terms of number of speakers – more than Swedish, Danish, Finnish or Greek. More than 80 television channels and more that 100 radio stations are broadcast daily in Catalan and there is a long publishing tradition. Each year in Spain almost 6,000 books are published in Catalan, some 12% of the total number of books published in the country.
More a passion than a language
What the Catalan experience seems to demonstrate is that banning a language may be an effective way of preserving it. Speakers of a banned language feel resentful and resist authoritarian reach into their culture. This Catalan emotion was picked up nicely by the Irish writer Colm Tóibín while living in Barcelona in the 1970s:
“People lived in a private realm. The parents had moved into that realm at the end of the Civil War, and they had remained in that realm … But what was also interesting was that Catalan, the language, was considered a way of being free … No one was talking about history. No one was talking about politics. But people were talking in Catalan. And they considered that a fundamental way of resisting, or being apart from official Spain, or the regime.”
This Catalan reaction is also expressed by a Catalan writer exiled in Mexico, Pere Calders, in his 1955 short story, “Catalans in the World”. A Catalan traveller in the Far East, at an evening party encounters a parrot which, to his surprise, utters Catalan phrases. He was overcome by emotion: “Many were the things which made us different but there was a language which made us one… Early that morning, when I left, I had a softer heart than the day I arrived.”
As a Catalan myself I have experienced this emotion. After years of teaching Spanish in Queen’s University, Belfast, last year I offered a course in Catalan for the first time. Standing in front of my students on that first day, I had to try hard to avoid tears.

A positive approach to social change ","Focusing on what is wrong isn’t always the most effective way to bring about social change, says Graeme Stuart. Building on our strengths can create much better results – both for small, local improvements as well as for international issues such as climate change
Social movements, including those opposing globalisation, environmental destruction and racism, typically start with a problem; a sense that things aren’t right and that change is needed. Often, they are fed by anger at the injustice, the violence or the environmental destruction surrounding us. They are often premised on struggle and resistance.
In 2009, after both my daughters had started school, I was ready to become involved in social change groups again. A few years earlier I had become immersed in strengths-based approaches to working with communities and wanted to explore this approach in the context of social change.
The Transition movement offered this possibility. It addresses some of the big environmental challenges we face – including climate change, our addiction to oil, the skewed economy and the myth of endless expansion – by creating alternative visions for communities and starting practical projects that help get there.
It sees the crisis we face as an “opportunity for doing something different, something extraordinary”.
The aim of Transition is to help you be the catalyst in your community for an historic push to make where you live more resilient, healthier and bursting with strong local livelihoods, while also reducing its ecological footprint.
“A strengths-based approach is not blind optimism or looking at the world through rose-coloured glasses. We don’t ignore problems, or pretend they don’t exist, but see them within a broader context.”
The Transition movement is an example of a strengths-based approach to social change. Rather than focusing on all the barriers we face in creating more sustainable communities, it focuses on opportunities and potential. Transition groups attempt to create the change they want to see.
They might create local currencies like in Brixton, UK; kitchen gardens like in Auroville, India; community owned power companies like in Fujino, Japan; or start local conversations exploring what neighbours can do together that they can’t do alone, as in Newcastle, Australia.
Adopting a strengths-based approach to social change can feel a bit like walking a tightrope. If, generally, social change movements critique how things are and challenge the status quo, strengths-based approaches look for, and focus on, strengths and opportunities. Social change movements have a tendency to rely on conflict and confrontation, while strengths-based approaches essentially rely on cooperation and collaboration.
Strengths-based approaches are based on the belief that everyone and all communities have skills and strengths, and that change is more likely and more sustainable when we focus on these strengths and possibilities rather than focusing on problems and challenges.
Strengths-based approaches recognise that people are the experts of their own situations and people working with them – social or community workers, for example – should not position themselves as experts with the all the answers. Strengths-based approaches, such as asset-based community-driven development, are community-led and rely on building and strengthening relationships.
Asset-based community-driven development starts with communities identifying their assets. This includes the skills and passions of individuals, voluntary community groups like local sports clubs, and their physical and economic resources. They then explore ways of building connections between them.
A strengths-based approach is not blind optimism or looking at the world through rose-coloured glasses. We don’t ignore problems, or pretend they don’t exist, but see them within a broader context. Change is dependent on using available strengths and resources. We make a conscious decision to focus on the CPR of strengths:
C – competencies, capacities, courage, creativity and character
P – promise, positive expectations, purpose, possibility and potential
R – resources, resilience, relationships, resolve, and reserves.
To take the metaphor of a half-full/half-empty glass, you might say that social change starts with the half-empty part of the glass (what is missing), while a strengths-based approach starts with the half-full part (what we have to work with).
When adopting a strengths-based approach, particularly in social and community work, there is a danger that we might reinforce neoliberal notions of individual responsibility – problems are due to the limitations of individuals and communities.
Unless we’re careful we may not pay enough attention to the broad political and social context, we might gloss over structural issues (such as the way in which economic inequality is perpetuated) and avoid conflict between competing interests. Strengths-based approaches therefore need the more critical input of social change movements and it is essential they have social justice at the heart of their work.
Like what you’re reading? Get your Positive News subscription here
But social change movements can also learn from strengths-based approaches. Social change happens when new ways of doing things replace old ways. Rather than putting all our efforts into stopping what we don’t want, strengths-based approaches can help us discover what we want to create instead. In a strengths-based approach to social change, our critique of the current social, political and economic context includes the things we value about the way things are.
We create a positive vision of where we want to head and actively look for people and resources that can help us get there.
Looking at big social issues like climate change, discrimination and poverty can be overwhelming. It can be hard to know where to start, and focusing purely on the problem can make it seem insurmountable. By noticing exceptions to the dominant way of doing things, looking for examples of what is working and creating an alternative vision, possibilities can start to emerge that assist us to move forward. We can see this approach in the sharing economy which challenges our current economic system by offering alternatives. It’s also much easier to retain our energy and sense of optimism in long-term campaigns when we are conscious of signs of hope and change.
The questions we ask, the language we use, and the images we create have a large influence on how we see people and situations. Asking “What is wrong with our community?” will produce quite different answers to asking, “What would our ideal community be like?” Similarly, think of the different images created by talking about ‘illegal immigrants’ rather than ‘families seeking safety and refuge,’ or discussing ‘collateral damage’ vs the ‘death of innocent civilians.’ A strengths-based approach means that we also think carefully about our how we view, and talk about, the people who disagree with us.
A strengths-based approach can help us imagine the transformation we want to see; it can help us find the things we love in the world as well as the things that need to change; and it can help us start creating a new way of being that is consistent with our vision.

Work less, play more ","The 40-hour work week is an ingrained part of our culture, but it does very little to enrich our lives. Lucy Purdy explores alternative working models that do away with the idea of the nine-to-five
Time is perhaps the most precious commodity of all. While we can buy more possessions and work new jobs, we can never make more time or recapture what has already been spent. But considering how much work dominates our lives, we question concepts around working and time relatively little.
While paid employment can provide security, for many, jobs are a means of putting “food on the table” within a work culture that feels more enslaving than natural or joyful. But now there is growing recognition that traditional working patterns no longer serve us. More and more people are searching for freedom from bosses, wages, commuting and consuming, seeking instead the lives we truly want to lead.
Today’s working model stems largely from the Industrial Revolution, whose architects convinced the masses of the importance of disciplined hard work. Rising early to toil all day for others was considered a virtue and this began to form part of the national consciousness. Families started to rely on their wages alone, buying in the food they had previously grown themselves, and work which was governed by the seasons, weather and necessity was replaced with standardised employment. The shift didn’t go unnoticed – poet William Blake was among those criticising the “cogs tyrannic” – but it established a narrow blueprint for a “dutiful citizen” which is largely still accepted today.
While capitalism was supposed to save society from having to labour as much, we have never worked more.
But now people are speaking out anew. The gift and sharing economies have grown in response to a system which means many people feel they’re unable to give what they want because “there’s no money in it”. While corporations have long used our money, skills, lives and arguably even relationships and health to build their businesses, many people are now seeking alternative routes toward financially, emotionally, intellectually and spiritually rewarding lives.
“More and more people are searching for freedom from bosses, wages, commuting and consuming, seeking instead the lives we truly want to lead.”
Institutions are experimenting with change, too. The city council in the Swedish city of Gothenburg has trialled a program of six-hour working days, hoping the move could create a healthier and happier workforce. In Japan – where a culture of overwork is particularly ingrained – the government is considering making it a legal requirement for workers to take more days of paid holiday each year.
And in the UK, a YouGov survey last year found that 57 percent of workers would support a four-day week, something championed by the New Economics Foundation. It says a ‘normal’ 40-hour week is neither natural nor inevitable and insists a shorter, more flexible working week would be good for people, the environment and the economy too.
At the same time, the size of the self-employed workforce in the UK has soared. Self-employed people now account for a record 15 percent of the workforce, totalling more than 4.6m people. While some argue this shift stems from people being unable to find full-time jobs, other surveys suggest people have deliberately chosen this route.
If our needs are to play, love, create and to connect with others and with nature, there seems to be a renewed effort to ask how we can nurture them. How could we better devote our energy and time to the areas of life that work – and money – cannot reach?

“We need to increase the time we spend doing voluntary, fun work, or to put it another way: playing.”
As William Morris and Bertrand Russell agreed, there are two types of work. One is unpleasant and done solely for money. And the other is creative and feeds our souls. But it is perhaps not the nature of the work, but more the conditions under which it is done, that really matter. The lawyer might well enjoy digging his garden at the weekend. But for an underpaid immigrant working twelve hours a day in the rain, doing the same work, digging, for a gang master, might be seen as unpleasant in the extreme. In the same way, I might enjoy mucking out a stable if I have chosen to do it, and if I own the stable. If I am forced to muck out a stable by an authority, I am very unlikely to enjoy it, even though it is exactly the same job.
This means that work is good if we voluntarily choose to do it. Therefore we all need to consider whether we need to quit our job and get a different one, or quit our job and create our own work life as a self-employed person. If, for whatever reason, this option is simply not practicable, then we ought to make better use of our leisure time. Instead of indulging in television or shopping, we should reclaim our leisure time for creative or useful or intellectually fulfilling pursuits, such as gardening, brewing beer or reading a book. On an individual level, and as a society, we need to reduce the time spent doing unpleasant work under coercion, and increase the time doing voluntary, fun work, or to put it another way: playing.”

“An unconditional basic income could free us up to do necessary work without anxiety about paying for our basic necessities.”
We can ask provocative questions that call attention to the systemic functions of wage labour. For example: why must we work to “earn a living”? Why should paid jobs be the main means by which income is distributed, and by which most people gain access to necessities like food and shelter? And why – in the US at least – is health insurance tied to paid employment?
‘Earning a living’ has come to seem inevitable to many people, but there are other ways to live. We could start by giving everyone an unconditional basic income.
So many people hate their jobs, and only endure them so they can put a roof over their head and food on the table. This is not the way we are meant to live! But our coercive system of enforced scarcity ensures that wage labour is the only way most of us can meet our fundamental survival needs.
Most of us want to be useful and do work that uses our gifts, but the system we have now makes that difficult, if not impossible. Certainly there’s no shortage of work that needs to be done, but a lot of it is unpaid, and there aren’t enough paid jobs to go around even in the best-case scenario. So why try to shoehorn everyone into paid jobs? An unconditional basic income could free us up to do necessary work – and enjoy greater leisure time too – without anxiety about paying for our basic necessities.

“Moving to shorter hours would challenge the prevailing assumption that the main purpose of life is to work more to earn more to buy more.”
Fewer hours of paid work per person is a guaranteed route to a better, balanced and inclusive labour market in the context of little or no economic growth. Today, the official norm is between 37.5 and 40 hours. No-one is supposed to work more than 48 hours a week, but there are plenty of exceptions to this rule and many opt out and work longer. One in five works more than 45 hours a week. Our proposal is for a new norm of 30 hours, moving over a longer period towards a working week of 21 hours.
Moving to fewer hours would challenge the prevailing assumption that the main purpose of life is to work more to earn more to buy more. It would give us more time to participate in local activities, enjoy our families and friendships, and cultivate creative pursuits. It would reduce the amount of resource-intensive consumption associated with being busy and time-poor, such as processed ready-meals, flying instead of taking the train and travelling by car rather than walking, cycling or taking public transport.
There is no evidence that fewer hours are bad for a country’s economic performance as measured by GDP. Indeed, many countries with fewer than average working hours have stronger than average economies. Our research has consistently found that workers on fewer hours tend to be more productive hour-for-hour, while workers who are better able to balance paid employment with unpaid responsibilities have higher wellbeing and constitute a more loyal, stable and committed workforce.

“We’d like to see companies acknowledge the absolute centrality of family to their employees’ lives.”
Rather than the ‘concept’ of work needing to be redefined, we would do better to address the ongoing lack of flexible-working and family-friendly workplaces.
Too often, we hear about parents who feel under pressure to pretend they’ve no interest at all in starting a family – right up to the point that they have their three-month scan. Rather than perpetuating a situation in which workers feel they have to conceal this side of themselves, we’d like to see companies acknowledge the absolute centrality of family to their employees’ lives. A culture in which anyone feels able to discuss their work-life balance with their boss, without fear of losing their job or missing out on a promotion, would increase employee loyalty and job satisfaction no end, and yield rich rewards for everyone.
Whenever we ask Mumsnet users how employers could do better, we always get the same answer: flexibility. More than a third of Mumsnet and Gransnet staff work part-time, or from home at least one day a week. Mobile technology is also making flexible working more possible than ever. Ideally the concept of ‘office hours’ will become increasingly obsolete and, as everyone’s working hours deregulate, mothers who work outside the home and require flexible hours to balance work and family will become less conspicuous; the relative importance of ability over ability-to-stay-in-the-office-after-5pm will increase.
All the evidence suggests that flexible working increases productivity and helps with staff retention. Companies who take the leap are rewarded with dedicated, hard-working and loyal staff.

“The worldwide localisation movement supports an economic shift that slows down the ‘work and spend’ treadmill.”
If you’re feeling overworked, financially stressed and depressed about the state of the planet, I have some good news for you. Looking at the world through different lenses can help you become a little kinder towards yourself and the rest of humanity.
The new lenses require us to step back and look at our economic system. Through globalisation – the deregulation of trade and finance – governments on both the left and right have supported huge banks and corporations at the expense of our jobs and financial security. As a result, most of us are working longer and longer hours to feed our families and keep a roof over our heads. At the same time, we’re bombarded by contradictory messages that tell us that we’re to blame for climate chaos and the extinction of species – while simultaneously urging us to consume more and more in order to create jobs and ‘grow the economy’.
There is a way out. The worldwide localisation movement supports an economic shift that slows down the ‘work and spend’ treadmill, uses fewer resources, and reduces CO2 emissions and other pollution. So far, the most successful demonstrations centre on food – farmers’ markets, community supported agriculture, edible schoolyards, urban gardens and more. From the USA and China to the UK and South Africa, these initiatives are bringing health back to our soil, our communities and our economies, while creating jobs that provide real meaning and connection. At the same time, local business alliances and local finance are revitalising economic relationships in other sectors of the economy, making them more accountable and responsible to nature and community.
Localisation bridges the artificial divide between healing people and the planet, between the personal and the political: it’s the economics of happiness.

Hope for homes: addressing the UK’s housing crisis ","As the term ‘housing crisis’ becomes ingrained in the British lexicon and millions of people face uncertain futures, seven organisations suggest their solutions
Britain is in the midst of a housing crisis. The average house in the UK now costs £253,000 – more than nine times the average salary and 44.9 times higher than in 1971, when a typical house cost £5,632. To put that in context, according to the charity Shelter, if the price of everyday items had risen at the same rate of inflation, a dozen eggs would now cost £10.33 and a jar of instant coffee £33.69.
Yet house prices continue to rise. Data from the Office of National Statistics show that prices are rising at their fastest since June 2010, up 9.1 per cent in the year to February 2014. Prices in London are up 17.7 per cent, the biggest jump since July 2007. It’s no surprise people are struggling to get on the property ladder.
But cost is not the only factor involved. Inadequate housing stock means there simply are not enough homes to go around. There were some promising figures for 2013, when around 122,000 new homes were started according to government figures – the most since 2007 – but the number of completed house fell by five per cent compared to the previous 12 months, and this is against a need for 250,000 new homes to be built each year, according to experts.
Like what you’re reading? Positive News depends on your support to publish quality inspiring content. Please donate to help us continue pioneering a more constructive news media.
And of the homes we do have, not all are in use. In 2013, the total number of empty homes in England fell to the lowest level ever recorded, according to the independent charity Empty Homes. However, it estimates that 845,000 homes remain empty homes across the UK, 300,000 of which are long-term empty.
What or who is to blame for the situation? Some point fingers at Margaret Thatcher, who despite giving council tenants the right to buy their homes, did not allow councils to spend the proceeds on building more houses. Others lay the blame at the door of banks, which stopped lending to first-time buyers during the 2008 recession and are only now beginning to do so again. Buy-to-let landlords come under fire frequently, blamed for hoovering up stock before others can get a look in, while some media claim an influx of immigrants has resulted in too many people chasing too few homes.
But there are now 4.5 million people in housing need throughout the UK, so attributing blame is perhaps futile when this is a crisis which demands attention now. Here, key organisations outline what can be done, and what they are doing, to address Britain’s escalating housing problem.
Steve Turner, Home Builders Federation
‘Government should support an increase in housing supply’
All commentators now accept that we have an acute and deepening housing crisis. We have been undersupplying new homes for years.
In her seminal report on housing for the Labour government in 2003, economist Kate Barker suggested we needed to be building more than 200,000 homes year. We estimate that in the decade since, we have missed that by a total of more than a million homes. The implications are stark; 1.7 million families are on local authority housing waiting lists while first-time buyer numbers collapsed.
The main short-term problem has been a lack of affordable mortgage lending. People just cannot afford the deposits of £20 to £30k that have been required to secure a mortgage [the Council of Mortgage Lenders says the average deposit for a first-time buyer is between 17 and 19 per cent of the property value].
If people can’t buy, builders can’t build. In the longer term the planning system has been the biggest constraint with not enough land coming through for the number of homes we need.
The Help to Buy Equity Loan scheme is addressing the demand issue. It means people can buy a new build home with a five per cent deposit. Its extension to 2020, announced in the budget, gives housebuilders longer-term confidence and we are seeing big increases in house-building activity as a result.
The new localism based planning system [designed to give local communities more power over planning in their area] adopted by this government is starting to bed down. But government needs to ensure it monitors its effectiveness closely and adapts it where required as it still takes far too long to get planning permissions.
Delivering the homes we need will provide significant social and economic benefits. As we approach an election, it is vital all parties commit to policies that allow the increases in supply required.

‘Use empty homes for community benefit’
Dot Dot Dot lets people who do great voluntary work live in houses that would otherwise be vacant, turning them from a burden into an asset. By doing this, we help everyone involved: providing a vital security service to property owners, giving our residents cheap accommodation and making a meaningful and measurable contribution to communities, as well as helping them to avoid the antisocial behaviour and crime which empty property attracts.
The shortage of secure, affordable, decent housing close to where people want to live and work might be the biggest problem facing communities in the UK today. If everyone has to work constantly just to pay the bills, they don’t have time to help their friends, family and neighbours, to give time to charitable projects or simply to enjoy life. We aim to relieve that pressure on the people we accommodate – letting them save money so that they can carve out more time and energy to help with worthwhile projects.
All of our residents live in London for between £35 and £70 a week – between a quarter and a third of what they’d pay to rent an equivalent property privately – and all give at least 16 hours a month to charitable projects, and in many cases far more. They are helping out with a huge range of good causes – from manning RNLI lifeboats to supporting survivors of domestic abuse; from mentoring kids from difficult backgrounds to befriending isolated older people. On top of that, they are great neighbours – keeping an eye out for those who live nearby and simply being friendly faces in corridors and on the streets.
Filling empty homes isn’t a whole solution to the housing crisis – we desperately need to build more places for people to live.

‘Make the housing market fairer’
“How can we turn the current crisis in private housing around?” invites the question. “What crisis?” For the wealthy retired there is no crisis. For many in that generation the housing market works. It has escalated in value over past decades thereby providing an asset, the profits from which can be realised for nursing home or social care costs, lifetime gifts to relatives, spent on themselves or finally passed on as inheritance. Increasing house prices have also allowed owners to borrow against their asset and gain access to the buy-to-let industry, thereby providing a comfortable retirement income on top of their pension.
But for first-time buyers, home-ownership is becoming an unaffordable aspiration, even for those lucky enough to have family help with deposits.
The issue also affects those consigned to renting. Lack of housing supply and ever-higher property values simply increase rents.
We need one million new homes, but a building programme on this scale takes time to plan and implement, so here are a few immediate fixes:
1. Get Britain moving: reward downsizers who move, with stamp duty holidays [where the cost of tax on home purchases is waived in certain circumstances].
2. Rein in the buy-to-letters: remove annual tax subsidies of £5 billion and ban interest-only buy-to-let mortgages.
3. Force land-bankers to build on or give up land.
4. Reform planning controls so affordable home building makes business sense to developers.
5. Share more: increase the rent-a-home tax allowance so it pays to share space.

Bill Nicol, Owenstown
‘Build cooperative settlements’
In recognition that there is a real need and considerable scope for original and progressive thinking, a new model has been developed by the Hometown Foundation, a Scottish charity established by a small group of philanthropic businessmen. Owenstown is a pioneering proposal to address the housing crisis through the creation of a new settlement, or a series of settlements. The approach represents a holistic, exciting and practical evolution of the Garden City model [urban planning that creates self-contained communities surrounded by green belts], but then incorporates refreshed ideas from social reformers such as Robert Owen and contemporary cooperative theories, in order to make greater steps towards a better and fairer society. This recognises the value of ownership, horizontal democracy and active citizenship.
Unlike most conventional private and public sector led approaches, the proposal is to advance a local, democratic solution and to build a cooperative settlement, which will be self-contained, self-funded, self-governed, self-owned and built by popular consent. The aim is to build a community that is greater than the sum of its physical parts. That the new settlement will be developed and delivered without the need for any public sector support makes the model a viable answer to increasing housing demand.

Christine Haigh, Let Down
‘Tighter controls on rent and letting agents’
Too many people in the UK are stuck in expensive, insecure and poor-quality housing. Many of them rent from private landlords – but now renters are fighting back. In London, there are now no fewer than nine private tenants groups organising locally, supporting each other and campaigning for better alternatives. Last year these groups set up a campaign called Let Down, highlighting the problems faced by people who rent from private landlords and demanding change.
At the moment, letting agents can get away with charging extortionate fees and discriminating against potential tenants if they receive housing benefit. They are also not properly regulated. We want the rest of the UK to follow the lead set by Scotland, which has outlawed fees for tenants, and aims to end to all discrimination. We’ve already seen some improvement in the way letting agents are regulated, but there’s still more to be done.
Two of the biggest issues we face are high rents and insecure tenancies. To tackle these, we are calling for the introduction of rent controls and secure tenancies for all tenants, whoever their landlord is. And since most of us would prefer not to be private tenants, we’re also calling for much more social housing, which is more affordable, better quality and more secure.

Simon Ross, Population Matters
‘Reduce population growth’
The housing market, like all markets, is governed by supply and demand. On supply, we can build more, though losing green spaces and the green belt affects health and quality of life. We can also build smaller, though smaller homes can lead to stress. However, it will always be difficult to satisfy continually rising demand. The UK population has risen by four million in the last ten years and this trend is forecast to continue.
England already has Europe’s highest population density. We are living longer and more people are living alone. We lead Europe in large family prevalence and a high birth rate and also have high net migration.
Reducing and reversing our population growth would relieve pressure on the housing market, as well as on transport, services and resources. We can do it in three ways. We can improve sex and relationship education and family planning services to reduce our high rate of unplanned pregnancies. We can promote the benefits of smaller families for individuals, society and the environment. And we can move back to the balanced migration position Britain has had throughout its history.

Sanford Housing Co-operative, London, outreach team
‘Create more housing co-ops’
A housing crisis is nothing less than a life crisis. I used to live in a private rental flat and it cost me almost every penny of my mindless full-time job to pay the rent on a home that never felt like mine. My social life was spent on a credit card. I’ve never been so depressed – and I was told I was lucky.
I now live at Sanford Walk Housing Co-operative, which gives me the two things that the private rental model never could: affordable secure housing and autonomous freedom in a home that feels like home.
I am no longer a cash cow for a landlord. Neither am I a forgotten council tenant. I am both tenant and member of a co-operative housing community. As a tenant I pay rent to the co-operative and, as a member, I help decide how we spend that money.
The co-operative is not just a model for housing, but a model for a flourishing home life. Most importantly, it works. Despite charging rents about half the market rate, we regularly have an annual surplus of more than £50,000. That’s money we can spend on ambitious projects to improve our lives and our community. Over the past ten years, members have built a high-capacity bike shed, reduced our carbon emissions by 60 per cent and created an orchard where there was once only wasteland.
We know that people are desperate to live in co-operatives: at Sanford, demand for rooms outstrips supply by about ten to one. Why, then, are there so few? In the UK, co-operatives make up just 0.1 per cent of the housing stock; in Sweden, the proportion is 17 per cent.

New charter aims to change perceptions of migration ","After 300 Eritrean asylum seekers lost their lives in a disaster at sea, a group of individuals came together to create a pact that aims to change the way we think about migration
The tiny island of Lampedusa in the Mediterranean saw a migration of a different sort on the weekend of 31 January – 2 February, when hundreds of people from Europe and North Africa concerned about the plight of migrants, joined forces to draft the Charter of Lampedusa.
The charter aims to establish a set of rights and freedoms for migrants and affirms that radical overhauls are necessary to combat social inequality and global injustice. It comes in the wake of the recent disaster where 300 Eritreans died when the boat carrying them from Libya caught fire and sank off the coast of Lampedusa. The Italian island, which is 70 miles off the coast of Tunisia, is a key entry point into Europe for migrants from Africa, who often pay traffickers to reach it. Tens of thousands have made the dangerous crossing in recent years, facing impoverished conditions upon arrival at camps across the island.
The new document is the result of months of online debate on the subject of migration, spearheaded by grassroots organisation Melting Pot. The group is deeply concerned about what it believes is an inadequacy of European policy on the issue, and is open to anyone who wishes to join the discussion.
Nicola Grigion from Melting Pot said the group aims to “change this negative perception of migration from the bottom up.” She added: “I don’t think it’s acceptable that someone who escapes from a war has to take a dangerous and unseaworthy boat, putting their life in the hands of traffickers. There has to be a different way.”
The Mayor of Lampedusa, Giusi Nicolini, said she hoped the Charter would lead to a change in the perception of Lampedusa as the ‘Alcatraz of the Mediterranean’.
The charter is currently available in Italian and is being translated into English and other languages."

Good Business: Kate Belcheva, Ultimately Eco ","Bulgarian immigrant Kate Belcheva went from part-time cleaning work to setting up a successful ethical cleaning company of her own, turning down business offers as she kept to her principles in order to make clean business green business
Good Business is a column hosted by Anna Levy from HUB Islington, an incubation space for socially driven entrepreneurs. Each month she catches up with the people leading change.
Anna: Hi Kate. Tell me about your business in a nutshell.
Kate: I run an ethical cleaning company called Ultimately Eco, which I launched in 2007. We only use environmentally friendly products and educate our staff in the importance of green practices. We also pay them all a fair London Living Wage.
How did it start?
As with many recent immigrants, I started part-time cleaning work as an easy entry into the job market. Coming from outside the EU (Bulgaria), the only way to get work legally was to be self-employed, so I took cleaning contracts alongside other casual work. What I really wanted to do though was to start a business of my own – one based on my personal principles and values, rather than somebody else’s.
Somebody suggested I start my own cleaning business and I really wasn’t keen at first. But I soon realised that there was potential here to do something good for the world and still make a living. I went from being a reluctant entrepreneur to a social entrepreneur!
What was the potential you saw in cleaning?
Cleaning is a large industry sector – at the time the UK cleaning industry was worth around £11bn – and I realised it could be a way to educate people about green issues.
My first focus was on the environmental and health impacts of cleaning. There are 30,000 manmade chemicals in the EU, many used in cleaning products, and only a small number have been properly safety-tested. You don’t need to be an expert to know how toxic some of these chemicals are – spray oven cleaner onto your cooker and you’re choking!
At the same time, I realised there was a problem in the way cleaners saw themselves and their work, and recognised the need for a shift in attitude. Cleaning is considered a low-skilled profession and of low importance, which really affects the motivation of those working in the industry.
Did you find it hard establishing yourself in the market?
There’s a lot of green-wash in the cleaning industry (so to speak!). Everyone is saying they’re green and ethical, but you can tell from their websites that they don’t really get it. We’ve worked with the CHEM Trust, using their research on harmful manmade chemicals to inform our strategy and communications, and we worked with sustainability consultancy Future Conversations to go carbon neutral – which we achieved in the last year!
How do you balance staying true to your values while making the business commercially viable? What kind of difficult decisions have you had to make along the way?
We had offers from several business partners, but declined, because they weren’t operating under the same values. Through these partnerships, we could have grown faster and had more influence, but it would have been at the cost of our principles.
It’s becoming harder to remain competitive as the market is swamped with ‘green’ cleaners charging lower rates. We haven’t cut our prices because of our determination to maintain a fair wage for our staff, and this has meant us losing business on occasion. What people don’t realise is that if you are getting a cheap deal, someone is almost certainly getting exploited.
Proudest moment so far?
Winning one of 25 placements on a business training programme run by the Goldman Sachs Foundation. This affirmed my business knowledge and taught me how we can grow, as well as introducing me to a new network of successful entrepreneurs. Getting onto the programme has really validated the choices I’ve made and it’s great that a company like Goldman Sachs is acknowledging the trend for socially and environmentally responsible business."

Bristol: the local city ","What began as an exercise in supporting her local economy quickly turned into a full exploration of independent Bristol. Rin Simpson explains why the city’s indie culture makes for a fine model that could be replicated nationwide
When I decided to ditch the supermarkets and high street chains for a year, I had no idea what to expect. Would I be able to source everything I needed from the butcher, baker and greengrocer? Or would I have to bankrupt myself in posh delis? Where would I buy my clothes without access to my favourite big-name brands, and would I have any money left for treats if I couldn’t build up points on my loyalty cards?
Luckily I live in Bristol, one of the most independently minded cities in the UK. It has 47 separate retail centres and as many as 5,400 retail properties – 70% of which are occupied by independents.
I also chose a really great time to make such a big lifestyle change. Within the last year, Bristol has introduced its own currency, elected an independent mayor and seen the opening of The Bristol Shop, the city’s first online store dedicated to local indie retailers.
The Bristol Pound (£B) is a great example of the city’s ‘outside the box’ thinking. Launched in September 2012, its main aim is to strengthen community connections, both between traders and their customers and between the traders themselves.
“Bristol has a wealth of independent traders and the Bristol Pound’s primary aim is to support them by leading customers to their door, providing free marketing and creating a community for indie Bristol businesses who are linked up and trading with each other as much as possible,” says the group’s communications manager Katie Finnegan-Clarke.
“The Bristol Pound also provides an effective ‘thinking’ tool for the city; it challenges Bristolians to think about what they want their city to look like.”
Today there is £B110,000 in circulation, with more than 500 stores accepting it – including the online Bristol Shop. The new mayor, George Ferguson, receives his salary in the currency, and the scheme has generated an estimated £3m worth of worldwide media coverage for the city.
“Independent retail has many benefits, from tackling environmental problems like food miles, to maintaining a level of creativity and innovation and preventing high streets from becoming generic”
Anecdotal evidence suggests that people are pleased with the results so far. “The Bristol Pound has been dubbed ‘happy money’ because people using it have noted the cheerfulness the local currency brings to monetary exchange,” says Katie.
It’s not often that you hear financial transactions being referred to in positive emotional terms, but there’s something about dealing with individual retailers, suppliers, designers and artisans that just feels better than sticking to faceless chain stores.
Everywhere you turn in this city there is innovation and independent thinking, whether it’s Isambard Kingdom Brunel’s magnificent suspension bridge or Banksy’s world famous street art. It’s part of the very personality of the city and its residents.
“I think that Bristol people like to believe that we have a common spirit of anarchic independence; we want to do our own thing,” says Rudy Millard, co-founder of The Bristol Shop, which went live in January 2013. “You get that feeling across all sorts of different areas in Bristol, not just retail but music, theatre, dance, clubbing, restaurants and cafes … it’s in our blood.”
To understand the spirit of its people, it is important to understand Bristol’s history. As a port city it has traditionally had a regular inflow of immigrants, bringing with them a raft of innovative new ideas. But it also owes much of its wealth to the slave trade, and high levels of social inequality have often resulted in uprisings, from the Corn Riots in Queen Street in the 19th century to the recent Tesco riots in Stokes Croft, which saw local residents protesting violently against a planned new supermarket.
Chris Chalkley is founder of the People’s Republic of Stokes Croft (PRSC), a community group and social enterprise set up in 2007 dedicated to promoting the interests of an area of the city that has suffered from dereliction and neglect. He takes a philosophical attitude towards the events that took place in April 2011.
“Voice has been at the centre of the Stokes Croft phenomenon, right through to the Tesco situation,” he says. “The majority of the community said they didn’t want a large supermarket with rapacious tendencies in the community and it ended up in a riot. The riot had a real reason and it was about a specific issue.”
“Every pound spent buying local produce from a local retailer puts twice as much money into the local economy as one spent in a national store”
Because of its dereliction, Stokes Croft has been a major centre for street art – or graffiti, depending on your viewpoint. A colourful and visual representation of Bristol’s independent spirit, it makes a fitting start to the stretch of independent stores running along the Cheltenham and Gloucester Roads, one of the city’s key indie shopping destinations.
Just across from the PRSC headquarters on Jamaica Street, for example, is a huge wall mural of a Japanese-style wave in bold red and white, accented with cartoon forms.
“When we got here, it was just a beige block,” Chris explains. “It was being painted out every week by the council – it was tagged and painted out, tagged and painted out. We finally managed to negotiate with the guys that owned the building and painted this mural, which is the Hokusai wave; it’s completely designed by local people, done by local people.
“We started to tidy up our own environment,” he adds, “to do things completely illegal that were so much better than what the council were doing, so that it was hard to prosecute. It was one step on from Banksy, to actually do it and actually stand firm and say: ‘Yes, we did it and this is why it’s here; bring it on!’”
Acting outside conventional social norms is something Chris certainly isn’t afraid of. In fact, he believes we need to rethink our model of society as a whole.
“The way we are is clearly not fit for purpose,” he says. “The model we have at the moment is something we’ve been sold as ‘the only one’, but it’s only been in existence for 250 years. It’s not part of natural law. We’re clearly making it up as we go along. If Stokes Croft has a role, it’s beginning to ask some of those questions that will prompt change.”
Whatever the future holds, many of Bristol’s residents are positive about the example the city is offering. The latest Quality of Life survey, which is undertaken by Bristol City Council each year, showed that satisfaction had improved in the majority of the key areas, from safety, air quality and leisure facilities, to a sense of belonging in communities and being able to influence neighbourhood decisions.
But independent retailers face many challenges. Although there are numerous support mechanisms in place, from small business rate relief to campaign groups like Bristol Independents, it’s still not easy for individual shop owners to go up against the multinationals with their economies of scale, the late night opening times of the supermarkets and the out-of-town malls that offer thousands of free car parking spaces.
The biggest problem, according to The Bristol Shop’s Rudy Millard, is a simple lack of awareness among consumers. “One of the common complaints we hear from local traders is that people here often don’t realise what they have on their doorstep,” he says. “Honestly, you can ask people about a shop that is two streets from where they live and they will never have heard of it, which is heartbreaking.
“I suppose if you are on foot you have the time to see what is around, but most people are zooming from place to place in cars, and it’s just easier to stop at an out-of-town place where they know everything will be on hand. And if you’re in a car, you often can’t stop anywhere near your local shopping street.”
“Bristol people like to believe that we have a common spirit of anarchic independence; we want to do our own thing” – Rudy Millard, co-founder of The Bristol Shop
Why is this a problem? Well, independent retail has many benefits, from tackling environmental problems like food miles, to maintaining a level of creativity and innovation and preventing high streets from becoming generic.
“Indie retail can play a big part,” says Rudy. “It can provide products that reflect the local character of an area as well as helping to keep money local, and this only serves to inspire other people to be more creative too. When you walk down a street filled with indie shops like Cotham Hill or Gloucester Road, it makes you want to be an active part of supporting the community in a way that browsing the shelves of a supermarket simply cannot.”
And, of course, spending money within the local business community makes more economic sense for the city. According to a report by the New Economics Foundation (nef), every pound spent buying local produce from a local retailer puts twice as much money into the local economy as one spent in a national store.
“The indie sector demonstrates a more sustainable model of business for Bristol,” says the Bristol Pound’s Katie Finnegan-Clarke. “We need indie businesses to flourish, especially with the current economic climate and the very real threat of massive climate change.
“Local currencies present a form of systemic change, which anyone based in the city can get involved in. Supermarkets have been described as ‘mining’ wealth from local communities; the Bristol Pound stops this from happening, making Bristol a wealthier place. The indie sector also employs more people per pound made and the Bristol Pound stops money disappearing into the global financial systems and tax havens.”
But it’s not all ethics and ‘doing the right thing’ – encouraging an independent culture also makes for an incredibly fun city to live, work and shop in. Sofia Lisowski, 29, moved to Bristol 10 years ago to study, and now works as a marketing account executive. She loves shopping in the city, particularly at the eclectic mix of stores on offer.
“Every area you go to is different,” she says. “So, for example, I know if I go to Gloucester Road I can get anything from decent bread, to Liberty fabrics, random furniture or a turkish flatbread. If I go to Clifton it’s usually for the quirky boutiques and good charity shops. Bedminster’s North Street is an area I haven’t explored fully, but I hear it’s good for bargain furniture finds. And St Nick’s market has the most amazing food. I also think that each area has its own distinct ‘flavour’. I love it!”
I couldn’t agree more. It only been a few months since I made the decision to become an indie shopper, but they have been transformative. I never knew how much my city had to offer until I took the time to really look. I’ve discovered incredible variety, surprising value, and some of the most wonderful people I could hope to meet. My original challenge was to avoid the supermarkets and big name brands for a year, but now I can’t imagine ever going back."

Simple living: president of Uruguay leads by example ","Despite being the figurehead of a country on the up, Uruguay president José Mujica donates his earnings to charity and lives on a small modest farm. Matthew Pike considers how his grounded principles are changing the political landscape
When José Mujica became Uruguay’s 40th president in 2009, he chose not to accept the chauffeur-driven police escort to the elaborate presidential palaces of La Residencia de Suarez. Instead, on that victorious evening, Mujica drove home to his wife Lucia at their modest farmhouse on the outskirts of Montevideo in one of his few owned assets, a 1987 Volkswagen Beetle. It was a simple and modest act that was to be the cornerstone of Mujica’s political direction from then on.
Last year, published data showed he was donating 90% of his monthly salary to charity. This included support to a government-led project called Juntos, which aims to build low cost, accessible housing for many of the country’s poorest communities currently living in slums. Such policies have long been pushed by Mujica’s left wing ruling party, Frente Amplio, a coalition of many small leftist movements.
Such generosity, combined with his modest declaration of assets – including his VW Beetle, an old tractor and a small piece of land shared with his wife – quickly coined for him the moniker ‘the world’s poorest president’. However, speaking to members of the Associated Press last year, Mujica was quick to dismiss not the reality of the term, but the mentality behind it, stating: “I don’t feel poor. Poor people are those who only work to try to keep an expensive lifestyle, and always want more and more.”
“I don’t feel poor. Poor people are those who only work to try to keep an expensive lifestyle, and always want more and more” – José Mujica
Mujica has attempted to align himself with his people, and in choosing a life of simplicity he meets as many of his needs from his small farm as his busy head of state schedule will allow. His wife Lucia Topolansky, a senator herself, has long been growing chrysanthemums on the farm, which are sold at the local farmers’ market. This seemingly austere life was detailed in an interview with Topolansky for MercoPress in 2010, shortly after the presidential inauguration, where the couple admitted they “belong to the old cash generation – we have no bank accounts and have never owned credit cards.”
Mujica’s election became another chapter in an ever-familiar South American political story. The son of a poor immigrant farming family, Mujica became involved in the armed guerrilla activist group Los Tupamaros. Mujica’s status rose among the movement, setting the foundations for a future in politics. During this ascent he was imprisoned by the dictatorship for a total of 14 years, shot six times by police and kept in isolation at the bottom of a stone well for 18 months until his release in 1985, when democracy had been restored.
Under Mujica’s watch, Uruguay’s economy is growing, with the World Bank’s Global Economic Prospects from January projecting a 4% growth rate for 2013. Unemployment levels have also been at their lowest under Mujica, falling to 6.1% last year, from 20% in 2002.
Estafania Galimberti, a 27-year-old graduate from Montevideo University who worked for the National Statistics Institute before finding work in one of the many newly invested foreign companies in the capital, believes her president is a great example to people all over the country. “Mujica really practices what he preaches and lots of people really love him because of it. It’s rare, but needed more than ever,” she says.
Despite drawing praise, Mujica has taken decisions that have caused divided opinion. A huge proponent of last year’s historic abortion legislation, giving the right to all women during the first trimester of pregnancy, Mujica signed it into law in January 2013. The decision caused much controversy, which he again stirred as the driving force behind a bill that would allow citizens to grow and sell a regulated quantity of marijuana. His original advocacy for the bill led to his lowest public support rating in September last year, where, according to pollster Cifra, his support dropped 11 percentage points on the previous year to an all-time low of 37% public approval. He has since loosened his support for the bill, suggesting the “time is not ripe.”
“Mujica really practices what he preaches and lots of people really love him because of it. It’s rare, but needed more than ever”
But as Agustina Russo, a young journalist living and working in the capital Montevideo suggests, it is his message that needs to be heard above the politics. “We are really proud of him for not changing his beliefs with all the power he has now,” she says. “He challenges us to use our knowledge to change the country, not to leave it to Europe or North America as so many have done before. Mujica says that everyone has a role and we must use it to improve our own country.”
When Mujica, the president not to have worn a tie in the last 20 years, ends his term of office in 2015, he will not retire with the thousands he’s earned; most of that will be in the hands of small charities. He will no doubt drive home to his wife Lucia and farm dog Manuela in that same old rusting VW Beetle, and while his politics will no doubt ripple into Uruguay’s future, it is his message and example that must reverberate further.
Speaking at last year’s Rio+20 sustainability conference, Mujica stressed: “Development cannot fly in the face of happiness; development should promote human happiness, love and human relations between parents and children and friends. Life is the most important treasure we have and when we fight, we must fight for human happiness.”"

Sharing the seeds of Britain’s cooking cultures ","A Dorset-based entrepreneur is tantalising the nation’s taste buds with an offering of ‘British ethnic’ seeds inspired by immigrant cooking recipes, picked up from his travels around Britain
Cooking and growing traditional foods are two of the most vital ways an immigrant community can maintain their links with ‘home’. Someone who understands this better than most is Michael Michaud, who describes himself as “a domestic plant hunter and culinary ethnobotanist.”
A French-Lebanese American who has lived in the UK since 1989, when he first arrived in England he started a market garden with his wife Joy, who, like him, has a PhD in Agriculture.
In 1994 they created Peppers by Post, the first company in the UK to grow and sell fresh chilli peppers by mail order. And in 2006 they hit the headlines when a new chilli they had developed, the Dorset Naga, was recognised as one of the hottest chillies in the world.
For the last five years they have also run Sea Spring Seeds, which currently offers 50 different varieties of chilli pepper seed and many other vegetables. Everything is developed – trialled, tested, and tasted – on their smallholding in West Dorset.
This year, growing out of Michael’s research and interest in the way British immigrant communities grow and cook their native vegetables and herbs, they launched a range of seeds called British Ethnic.
“People don’t think of the countryside as being multi-ethnic,” says Michael, “But every small town has its Indian and Chinese restaurant. I spend a lot of time travelling around the country talking to people and going round their allotments. We work with Bangladeshis, Italians, Japanese, Thais, Africans. There is a lot of camaraderie. We share values about food. And we share seeds.”
“People don’t think of the countryside as being multi-ethnic, but every small town has its Indian and Chinese restaurant”
Raj Koomar, a retired engineer from Guyana who has lived in the UK for 53 years, grows all the usual British vegetables on his allotment in London. He also grows 10 different varieties of chilli, many of them from the Michauds, including Weri Weri, a hot pepper from his native country. “Whenever the Michauds produce something new I try to grow it,” he says. “The tropical plants need a greenhouse, but apart from that, they grow here very well.”
Recently, Raj’s sister-in-law, who lives in Canada, was given the seed of a chilli called Rugosa Scorpion by a friend who had brought the seed back from Trinidad. She sent the seed to Raj and he gave it to Michael, who is trialling the chilli in Dorset at the moment.
The famous Dorset Naga was also developed in this way. The original seed stock was discovered in an oriental food store in Bournemouth. Joy and Michael took the seed – a variety called the Naga Morich from Bangladesh – and, over several years, developed the distinctive shape, size and colour that became their own version of the chilli. This was eventually certified as a new species by the Community Plant Variety Office of the EU. And now it is even listed in the Collins Dictionary.
Helen Harmattie, who has run the Taj Mahal restaurant in Bridport for 30 years, also looks out for seeds whenever she is travelling. She brought back the seed for a chilli called Fire from a holiday in Surinam. It is now in the Michaud’s catalogue.
She also uses all the British Ethnic range in her cooking, “We used the Dorset Naga to create a very popular and very hot curry for the restaurant called The Dorset Blast. I use this chilli when it is ripe and red for curry. But we love to eat it raw, green and unripe at home with family and friends,” she said. For her, the great advantage of having such exotics grown locally is not only that they are so fresh, but that she can choose exactly at which stage of ripeness to have them picked.
The British Ethnic range of seeds currently includes Calalloo, a caribbean spinach; Poi Saag, a variety of tropical green popular in Asian, Chinese and Thai cooking; Kerala, a bitter melon resembling a cucumber, which is loved by the Bangladeshis and good for diabetics; and an aromatic herb, Kasuri Metti, a close relative of fenugreek. Many more are in the pipeline.
These days, Joy and Michael travel to food fairs all over the country. They regularly attend Asian festivals, or ‘melas’. Michael writes and gives talks on ‘The Immigrant Allotment’. They judge curry-making competitions and host tutored chilli tastings. They continue to produce thousands of Dorset Naga seeds every year and in 2013 have added 23 new general varieties of plant to their catalogue.
As plant hunters and breeders, they are always on the look-out for new and exceptional varieties. As Joy says, “It’s all about producing good real food. But, above all, food which really means something to the people who grow, cook or eat it.”"

Kayaker journeys 3,000km to promote rights of asylum seekers ","A Frenchman has reached the halfway point in a kayaking voyage from Tunisia to Brussels, where he hopes to present a petition for asylum seekers’ rights to the European Parliament
A year after setting out on the 3,000km journey, Frenchman Alexandre Georges has arrived in Rome on his quest to present a petition in Brussels for a better and more standardised system for asylum claims.
Georges believes claimants are treated inhumanely, particularly in certain European countries.
The first stage of Georges’ journey replicated the Mediterranean crossing that Human Rights Watch estimates has claimed the lives of 13,500 people trying to reach Europe in unseaworthy boats since 1998.
The 44-year-old former office worker was born in Paris and moved to Canada in his twenties, where he became sensitised to the treatment of paperless migrants. He returned to Europe in 2009 and has since used up all his savings to fund his Kayak for the Right to Life project.
Georges believes the creation of a single agency to manage accommodation centres and process asylum claims across the continent could save billions of pounds, while ensuring a system that respects human rights.
The EU already has a single agency to police its borders, but management of immigrants claiming asylum once they arrive is currently in the hands of each member state, under the Dublin II Regulation. Agreed in 2003 between all EU countries as well as Iceland and Norway, the regulation says that asylum seekers must make a claim in the first EU state they enter. However, Georges and other activists say that some countries are much worse at handling asylum seekers than others, so believe a Europe-wide agency could pull up standards. This also has come from within the EU itself, with commissioner for home affairs Cecilia Malmstrom calling for a common agency since 2010.
In September of this year, commissioner Malmstrom reiterated the need for a common system, saying: “The standards for receiving asylum seekers vary considerably between EU countries. There are countries that handle their commitments well. There are countries where reception conditions need to improve.”
As an example of varying standards, Georges highlights a case in December 2011, when the European Court of Justice ruled that the UK could not send an Afghan asylum seeker back to Greece (where he’d first entered Europe before travelling to the UK), because he risked “inhuman treatment” in Greece’s overcrowded detention centres.
Georges’ petition currently has more than 600 signatures. The kayaker plans to continue collecting signatures as he lobbies politicians in Rome over winter, before kayaking up the Italian coast and via the River Rhone to Brussels, where he hopes to present the petition by next summer."

Group cycles from London to Jerusalem to promote social and ecological justice ","A group of 18 artists, food growers and community activists are cycling from London to Jerusalem to unite communities working for social and ecological justice
Having left the UK on 21 March 2011, the ‘bicycle caravan’ is due to arrive in Jerusalem in July and is stopping at farms, social centres and schools along the way to take part in workshops and debates. Travelling under the name Pedal, the group is using video, photography, audio and theatre projects to compile a cultural document tracking the stories, experiences and ideas it encounters en route.
“It is the beginning of a story of learning, sharing and mutual inspiration from London to Jerusalem and many sites between,” says Pedal member Adam Payne.
The initiative has three main aims; the first is to link stories of struggle. “We believe that the power of social and ecological movements comes from the integrity of personal relationships and the diversity of ideas they share,” says Adam. “By carrying experiences between communities, we gather momentum behind movements for social change. We’re travelling through sun and rain, saddle sores and rushing energy, strengthening networks of living, breathing solidarity.”
The second aim of the group is to focus on issues of access to land, seed and water, linking the struggles of agriculturalists, migrants and oppressed communities for equal access to the Earth’s resources. “Ecologically sensitive food growing is an important foundation for sustainable and resilient communities everywhere,” says Adam. “In Palestine people are deprived of land, seed and water by the Israeli military occupation and illegal settlements,” he claims.
So far, Pedal has taken part in actions against corporate control of seeds, it has swapped seeds through its own seed bank and shared experiences with both rural and urban food growers.
The third aim of Pedal is to support the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) campaign. “BDS is an international grassroots movement that challenges the institutions and companies that profit from and normalise the occupation of Palestine,” explains Pedal member Rachel Blake. “It was called for in July 2005 by 170 organisations representing Palestinian civil society and stems from a model which became critical in ending apartheid in South Africa.”
Pedal, which uses consensus organisation to ensure democratic decision making, decided that going by bicycle was the obvious choice for such a journey. “It allows us to travel and visit communities while interacting with the landscape and cultures we flow between,” explains Rachel. “Furthermore, it allows us to move long distances while minimising our reliance on destructive forms of consumption."

Positive Changes from Rural Media ","The Rural Media Company, an award winning media, education, development and production organisation, has a reputation for powerful, socially-aware media. They enable rural communities to learn about and use media, by participating in practical activities. There are several projects being run by the organisation. This page highlights some of the work currently being undertaken.
Nic Millington, Chief Executive of the Company, explains why there is a need for their work. ‘Rural life and the coverage of rural communities is often through the prism of a metropolitan point of view,’ he says. ‘By locating ourselves in a rural area and allowing local people to have an input, it gives a platform for alternative points of view.’
Nic believes that creative and media industries could play a vital future role in the regeneration of the countryside. ‘Our rural areas are undergoing a huge demographic change and many people from the digital and media industries are relocating to the countryside,’ he points out. ‘They choose to move here for the quality of life and the new technologies allow it. Media is a high value industry and so it provides a tremendous opportunity for regeneration.’
To create less urban-dominated media would mean developing a Rural Media Company in every rural region in the UK ñ an idea not lost on Nic and indeed, one that he would love to see happen.
In the meantime and testament to the work of the organisation, are all the long-term partnerships that it builds. Not just that but the high number of individuals who have been trained by them and then gone on to get jobs in the industry. Some have even returned to the area to establish their own media businesses.
One of the reasons that Rural Media can develop long-term partnerships is down to the company’s ability to reach out into so many, often overlooked communities ñ a fact that Nic is particularly pleased with. ‘We have a strong social inclusion agenda and have done projects with gay and lesbian groups, migrant workers and Gypsy, Roma and Traveller communities,’ he says.
Nic reveals his interest in film comes from his own childhood experiences. ‘I could see the power in communication,’ he says. ‘Particularly if it’s put into the hands of ordinary people.’

Local Films for Local People ","Community films are produced in much the same as way any other film, except that they seek to involve the surrounding community in which they are based. A classic example of this would be the work of Ken Loach and Shane Meadows.
Recent community films, produced by the Rural Media Company include Show and Tell, a startling testimony made by rural people living in poverty and Crafta Webb, a historical drama starring local communities from Herefordshire.
Show and Tell brings unfamiliar voices to the television screen and exposes the hardship and stigma of surviving on a low income in the countryside. ‘People do not understand the hidden costs of living in a rural area,’ says Emma ñ a lone parent and one of the contributors. ‘We are marginalised. The dentist is in Hereford. We can get a bus but it takes an hour and costs £3 each way. That’s £10 there and back for me and my child.’
The Rural Media Company provided easy-to-use, light-weight video cameras, as well as the necessary guidance and support, to record personal testimonies.People speak of having nowhere to live, abandoning A-levels for lack of money, of being unable to work because they cannot afford a car, of living without a telephone, a television, a computer or even hot water.
The word poverty’ was identified as being part of the problem.Contributors considered it inherently damaging and isolating because it signified personal inadequacy and failure. In fact, it made their situation worse. The filming process itself was empowering.In the followup interviews, contributors’ self-confidence was boosted by seeing themselves on screen describing their experiences and this helped to break a debilitating cycle. ‘It was great to be asked my opinion on a subject that obviously related to my situation,’ says Craig, a young local unemployed man, ‘and I am glad I did it because these are matters that need to be talked about.’
The Crafta Webb project was a different kind of scheme. However, it had a similar empowering effect on the local community. It was set in the actual location of a largely forgotten community of economic migrants, who came to the area sometime in the 1800s. The project brought together the young and old, who were able to draw parallels with issues around immigration today.

The Curitiba Story ","When things aren’t working out, it’s wise to deal with the root of the problem. This often takes courage but when we get the basics right, the rest flows naturally. This is true for any aspect of life and it works on any scale. Take cities for instance: the typical city is a huge, clogged network, designed long before mass motoring and now jammed with vehicles, their emissions and noise.
Usually, the average planner’s response is to make more room for traffic, leading to even more vehicles and pollution. However, three decades ago, one city, Curitiba in Brazil, boldly addressed its traffic problems at root and consequently found that, with vision and willpower, all aspects of city life could be improved.
What prompted this approach? In the 1940s Curitiba’s population was around 150,000 and by the 1980s, it was one million. This rapidly expanding city had little money to spend and so, great wisdom and courage were required. Curitiba is now a city of two million souls and an inspiring example of urban development. This is the Curitiba story.
Transport
In 1972, the traffic and pollution in and around the city centre had reached unmanageable proportions. At this stage, planners would normally analyse traffic volume and then invest in creating more capacity ñ wider streets, overpasses, underpasses, or even an underground, subway, rail system. Curitiba’s officials though, decided that people should come first, not cars. They decided to be innovative and to take one step at a time. The first would be to close the busiest street to cars. The shopkeepers were angry; they had no experience of pedestrian precincts and fearing loss of trade, they vowed to fight the change.
Mayor Jaime Lerner, an architect and civil engineer, could see the bigger picture and decided upon a plan: the work would be done so quickly, there would be no time for objections. One evening, teams of engineers swooped upon the area and worked overnight. It was a fait accompli. That area was now people friendly’ and, very quickly, the shopkeepers discovered they were getting more business, not less. Soon, the nearby traders were calling for the precinct to be increased. Encouraged, Mayor Lerner and his team decided to put people first on a citywide basis.
Creating a subway system at 100 million dollars per square kilometer, was out of the question, so too, grand scale road works. Instead, architect Rafael Dely designed the Trinary Road System with dedicated public transport lanes. Curitiba had three wide, parallel roads passing through its centre. The long-term plan was to create the equivalent of a subway system above ground level. Now, the central road was given over to a bus rapid transit system and local access traffic. The roads either side became one-way thoroughfares. This greatly reduced jams and speeded traffic flow. To encourage use of public transport in the future, city planners did not allow any new commercial buildings in the old city unless they were close to bus stops. Furthermore, they planned city expansion along five, well-served, axial routes.
In 1979, Mayor Lerner introduced the Rede Integrada de Transporte ñ RIT, an integrated bus transport system, where citizens pay once to go anywhere in the city. Also, under this scheme, the companies running the various buses are paid, not by the travellers but by the city, at a rate per kilometer, travelled by each bus. Passengers pay prior to embarkation at tube stations’ along the routes and there are bus stops every 500 metres. In 1980, articulated buses were introduced to increase capacity and the public system became more popular.
In 1992, to further emulate a subway system, larger biarticulated buses ñ 25 metres long and capable of carrying 270 passengers ñ were brought in. Now, RIT included a three colour-coded service: Biarticulated (red), Speedy (grey ñ for longer distances, non-stop) and Local (orange), linking in the outlying towns, all for use on one ticket. Already cheaper than car travel, public transport became even more efficient, reliable and easier. It flourishes to this day, operating like a subway system. At peak times, there is a bus every 50 seconds!
Curitiba has a transport system admired worldwide. It has been adopted, partially, by some Western cities but Jaime Lerner says that the system must be fully implemented to gain the full potential: a city that is pleasant to get around and to live in, with reduced traffic, reduced fuel consumption and reduced pollution. Bogot·, the capital of Colombia, has adopted the system fully.
Housing and Education
Like most cities, particularly in South America, Curitiba has grown rapidly over the recent decades. During fast growth, shanty towns develop where people without skills find themselves in a poverty trap. Curitiba’s planners decided that these newcomers should be integrated into productive city life as soon as possible and that, for rich or poor, there should be no ghettos. Low-income developments were therefore brought close to the city centre.
Having designed the road system so well, as the routes expanded, the planners were able to integrate new housing and business developments more easily. They focused on affordable housing, free business installations, free training and other innovations including Autogest„o, where the population participates in housing development and planning issues. This offsets the lobbying of the privileged few and enables holistic solutions to be conceived and applied.
As the city’s population increased, commercial development grew along the roadside radiating from the centre. The municipality provided schools, clinics and daycare centres. Special warehouses were also built as business incubators’. Many newcomers had no job skills – here they received free education with classes designed to meet workforce needs. They were trained with guaranteed employment upon course completion and could open their own businesses within the incubation’ warehouses.
Housing developments also included specially designed homes for those who wanted to start their own business. Budding entrepreneurs were allowed to buy their own place and received free training and assistance for up to two years. In these properties, the commercial space is located on the ground floor with the accommodation above.
The population continued to expand and increase pressure on the housing market. To help reduce the number of migrants to the city, Vilas Rurais was launched to improve the quality of life in rural areas. Schools and health centres were built in outlying villages and a project called Cambio Verde was initiated.
Through this scheme the city buys excess crops and exchanges them for recyclable materials that are collected by the city’s shanty town dwellers. The city’s poor receive food and the region’s farmers make a living. With the introduction of Cambio Verde, city rubbish collection increased with no extra cost to the municipality.
Recycling
As Curitiba’s shanty towns expanded, they spread along riverbank areas liable to flood. Access for rubbish collection vehicles was difficult and the city did not have the resources to adequately increase their collection fleet.
Civil Engineer Nicolau Kl¸ppel came up with an idea that was to win him a United Nations award. His idea was to get shanty dwellers to collect waste in exchange for bus passes. This was feasible because the bus operators were paid per bus-kilometer rather than per passenger journey. There was a great response, so a waste recycling centre was created and a campaign called Trash that is not trash’ was launched. The aim was to keep the city clean, reduce landfill and generate income. Within three months, 70 per cent of Curitiban homes were separating their rubbish for recycling.
Today, the recycling business in Curitiba has reached maturity, with 80 per cent of city recyclables collected by the poor, who then sell the materials on to private companies. Many earn twice the minimum wage for their
efforts.
The recycling centre gives meaningful employment to those under care, such as drug addicts. These constitute about 50 per cent of the workforce. All employees are encouraged to move on to better jobs; they are trained in IT skills on recycled computers. Whilst the centre’s main income is from selling materials to private recycling companies, it also creates new products from old; for example, toothpaste tubes are turned into roofing tiles.
As well as the main recycling area, the centre has teaching and conference rooms, a playground and museum. It is an education hub, where all ages can learn about and get involved in all the recycling processes. Any profits go to city charities.
Parkland from Floodplain
Each year, in the rainy season, areas of Curitiba suffered from flooding as the local rivers broke their banks. By 1966, there were already shanty towns on the riverbanks; this was a dangerous situation. Having realised that forming canals and embankments would transfer flood problems downstream rather than stop them, Nicolau Kl¸ppel proposed turning floodplains into seasonal parks. Floodplain dwellers were given compensation that enabled them to move elsewhere and work began.
River bends are helpful in controlling water volume and so Nicolau’s proposal respected each river’s meandering shape. Lakes were excavated in each park to act as flood control areas. When the rivers rise, the lakes become filled, letting their volume out slowly so as not to create flooding downstream.
There are 30 parks in the city and each park is different. For example, IguaÁu Park is for wildlife. Tangua Park, close to the city centre, is a recreational area. It has an old quarry that has been transformed by a waterfall and river tunnel. Barigui Park has restaurants, playgrounds, walkways and a convention centre. S„o LourenÁo Park is known for its concerts. In every park, there are sheep that have been brought in to keep the grass short. Over the years, the cost of creating these beautiful parks has been covered by property taxes paid on homes that were built overlooking the landscape.
In 1960, the green area of Curitiba was measured at 0.5 metres square per inhabitant but now, it is 80 metres square per inhabitant ñ more than three times the minimum amount recommended by the World Health Organisation. With more recreational space, tourism has increased too. It is calculated that all this has been achieved for just 20 per cent of the cost of canalisation. As with the transport, housing and recycling projects, the seasonal parks have been an extremely effective investment for the city.
A Convenient Truth
Curitiba has lessons for all other urban conurbations. A poor city has been transformed into one of the greenest and most livable cities in the world.
‘If every city implemented solutions like those in Curitiba, we would not be having the current climate problems,’ says Mayor Jaime Lerner. ‘We have to work fast because we don’t have a lifetime to do things and we don’t have the right to sacrifice future generations waiting for projects to be completed.’

First Among Equals ","toledo_portrait.jpgRight Livelihood is an ancient Buddhist philosophy, which embodies the principle that all people should follow an honest occupation that fully respects all others and the natural world. This means being responsible for the consequences of our actions and taking only a fair share of the earth’s resources.’ The Right Livelihood Award was first founded in 1980, by Jakob von Uexkull, a Swedish/German writer, lecturer, professional stamp collector and Member of the European Parliament. Jakob wanted to create a humanitarian prize which would ‘recognise the efforts of those who are tackling … such challenges as the pollution of air, soil, water, the danger of nuclear war, the abuse of basic human rights, the destitution and misery of the poor, and over consumption and spiritual poverty of the wealthy.’ To raise the funds needed to set up the Right Livelihood Foundation, he had to sell his rare stamp collection. The Award has since become known as the Alternative Nobel Prize and there are now more than 100 laureates from 48 countries around the world.This year, there have been four joint recipients of the Right Livelihood Award. Amongst others, these include The First People of the Kalahari and their leader, Roy Sesana. The Bushmen have been continuously fighting against government efforts to relocate them from their native land. Through perseverance and personal dedication, Roy, who’s bushman name is Tobee Tcori, has been bringing the injustices brought upon them to light and receives the award for his ‘.. resolute resistance against eviction from their ancestral lands, and for upholding the right to their traditional way of life.’ Irene Fernandez, a 60 year old mother and long-time foster carer from Malaysia, is recognised … for her outstanding and courageous work to stop violence against women and abuses of migrant and poor workers.’ She said: ‘It is recognition at a global level for the people to look at the conditions of migrant workers and marginalised communities. The Award will be a way for me to put money into strengthening the work that is already in process.’The Honorary’ Right Livelihood Award was presented to the artist, Francisco Toledo, for his …devotion to art and to the protection, enhancement and the renewal of his cultural heritage, natural environment and the community life of his home town, Oaxaca, in Mexico.’ Francisco’s art is filled with animal and aztec imagery, influenced by his country’s heritage of history and mythology. For over 20 years he devoted his time and wealth to improving the cultural wellbeing of his Oaxacan community, turning the town into a vibrant centre for the written and visual arts. He also helped to create a number of artistic and culturally important institutions including The Graphic Arts Institute of Oaxaca and Ediciones Toledo, a printing house which has published translations of poetry by Seamus Heaney and John Ashberry.The Right Livelihood Award Foundation has now started the distribution of its new school brochure, Pioneers for Peace. The brochure was produced with financial support by the Swedish Ministry of Foreign Affairs to spread information to all students about Right Livelihood Award recipients’ work for peace and global security. It contains sections on conflict healing, nuclear disarmament, human rights and calls for peace. ‘Everyday, while we grow up, our world seems to become more complex, so let’s just hold on to simple claims like: I want to live in a safe world.’ says Margot Wallstrˆm, Vice-President of the European Commission.

Entrepreneur of the Year ","The Midlander of the Year Awards honour those who have increased the prestige of the region or who have made an outstanding contribution to the social, political, industrial, cultural or sporting life of the area. The Social Entrepreneur Category winner was Zadvinder Padda, for his pioneering work in gang labour’ legislation over the last five years.
Many gangmasters, these days, have an unsavoury reputation, exploiting vulnerable migrant workers and reaping huge rewards from their labour. The cheap prices for fruit and vegetables that we pay in the major supermarkets are mainly due to the fact that workers are hugely underpaid, both living and working in poor facilities with no training or health and safety measures.
Fusion Personnel, a company first established by Zadvinder’s father, now produces over 300 tonnes of soft fruit, mainly strawberries, and employs over 600 workers, most of whom are migrants. All staff are paid on an hourly rate rather than on a piece-work rate, which ensures everyone receives proper wages. Fusion Personnel offers a full training scheme for its workforce based on NVQ qualifications. This training includes basic language skills for those who find themselves in a new and unfamiliar, cultural environment. Here, employee development is at the heart of the business ñ a far cry from the common public perception and reality of the traditional gangmaster system.
Fusion Personnel are the first ethnic minority’ members of the Assured Produce Scheme and in fact, are the only ethnic minority’ farmers in the UK. Although many migrants come from rural backgrounds, like the Punjab, none of them, until now, have taken up farming in the UK. This company demonstrates that with hard work and a spirit of entrepreneurism, migrants to the UK can make a valuable contribution to the food and farming sector, creating secure jobs and a thriving business, while looking after the well-being of the workforce. The awards took place at ITV’s Central Birmingham Studios and a programme celebrating the winners was broadcast on ITV on 15th February 2005."

Not In Our Name ","A host of well known people including Gore Vidal, Gloria Steinem, Oliver Stone and Kurt Vonnegut have put their name to the following Not In Our Name’ statement which has appeared in the New York Times
A host of well known people including Gore Vidal, Gloria Steinem, Oliver Stone and Kurt Vonnegut have put their name to the following Not In Our Name’ statement which has appeared in the New York Times
Let it not be said that people in the United States did nothing when their government declared a war without limit and instituted stark new measures of repression. The signers of this statement call on the people of the U.S. to resist the policies and overall political direction that have emerged since September 11, 2001, and which pose grave dangers to the people of the world. We believe that peoples and nations have the right to determine their own destiny, free from military coercion by great powers. We believe that all persons detained or prosecuted by the United States government should have the same rights of due process. We believe that questioning, criticism, and dissent must be valued and protected. We understand that such rights and values are always contested and must be fought for. We believe that people of conscience must take responsibility for what their own governments do; we must first of all oppose the injustice that is done in our own name. Thus we call on all Americans to RESIST the war and repression that has been loosed on the world by the Bush administration. It is unjust, immoral, and illegitimate. We choose to make common cause with the people of the world. We, too, watched with shock the horrific events of September 11, 2001. We, too, mourned the thousands of innocent dead and shook our heads at the terrible scenes of carnage — even as we recalled similar scenes in Baghdad, Panama City, and, a generation ago, Vietnam. We, too, joined the anguished questioning of millions of Americans who asked why such a thing could happen.
But the mourning had barely begun, when the highest leaders of the land unleashed a spirit of revenge. They put out a simplistic script of good vs. evil’ that was taken up by a pliant and intimidated media. They told us that asking why these terrible events had happened verged on treason. There was to be no debate. There were by definition no valid political or moral questions. The only possible answer was to be war abroad and repression at home. In our name, the Bush administration, with near unanimity from Congress, not only attacked Afghanistan but arrogated to itself and its allies the right to rain down military force anywhere and anytime. The brutal repercussions have been felt from the Philippines to Palestine, where Israeli tanks and bulldozers have left a terrible trail of death and destruction. The government now openly prepares to wage all-out war on Iraq, a country which has no connection to the horror of September 11. What kind of world will this become if the U.S. government has a blank check to drop commandos, assassins, and bombs wherever it wants? In our name, within the U.S., the government has created two classes of people: those to whom the basic rights of the U.S. legal system are at least promised, and those who now seem to have no rights at all. The government rounded up over 1,000 immigrants and detained them in secret and indefinitely. Hundreds have been deported and hundreds of others still languish today in prison. This smacks of the infamous concentration camps for Japanese-Americans in World War 2. For the first time in decades, immigration procedures single out certain nationalities for unequal treatment.
In our name, the government has brought down a pall of repression over society. The President’s spokes-person warns people to “watch what they say.” Dissident artists, intellectuals, and professors find their views distorted, attacked, and suppressed. The so-called Patriot Act, along with a host of similar measures on the state level, gives police sweeping new powers of search and seizure, supervised if at all by secret proceedings before secret courts. In our name, the executive has steadily usurped the roles and functions of the other branches of government. Military tribunals with lax rules of evidence and no right to appeal to the regular courts are put in place by executive order. Groups are declared terrorist’ at the stroke of a presidential pen. President Bush has declared: “you’re either with us or against us.” Here is our answer: We refuse to allow you to speak for all the American people. We will not give up our right to question. We will not hand over our consciences in return for a hollow promise of safety. We say NOT IN OUR NAME. We refuse to be party to these wars and we repudiate any inference that they are being waged in our name or for our welfare. We extend a hand to those around the world suffering from these policies; we will show our solidarity in word and deed. We who sign this statement call on all Americans to join together to rise to this challenge. We applaud and support the questioning and protest now going on, even as we recognise the need for much, much more to actually stop this juggernaut. We also draw on the many examples of resistance and conscience from the past of the US: from those who fought slavery to those who defied the Vietnam war by refusing orders. Let us not allow the watching world today to despair of our silence and our failure to act. Instead, let the world hear our pledge: we will resist the machinery of war and repression and rally others to do everything possible to stop it.FURTHER INFORMATION : For a list of signatories visit WebsiteWEB SITE : http://: www.nion.us"
