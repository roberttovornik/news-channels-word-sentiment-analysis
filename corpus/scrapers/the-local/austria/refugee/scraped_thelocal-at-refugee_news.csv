					12:26 CEST+02:00				", The Local,Austria's refugee crisis: One year on,"A year ago this week, 71 refugees and migrants were discovered in the back of a truck in Austria’s A4 road having suffocated to death while being smuggled into central Europe.
The incident was the first time the refugee crisis had really reached Austria’s doorstep and it put the country under the spotlight of international media. A few days later hundreds of frustrated refugees started walking from Budapest to Vienna and were met with a wave of solidarity in Austria, with some politicians even philosophising about a new welcoming culture.
Fast forward a year and Austria has seen significant changes in its refugee policy, eventually introducing one of Europe’s strictest asylum laws. The Local looks back at some of the key moments in a year that changed Austria.
Austrians show solidarity as numbers peak
As the refugee crisis reaches Austria’s doorstep in September, authorities begin ferrying refugees from the Hungarian border to Vienna and then onto Germany via Salzburg. In September around 170,000 refugees and migrants pass through this way. The initial compassionate management of people by Austrian police, railway bosses and politicians meant the country was seen in a favourable light internationally - particularly compared to the rough treatment refugees received from Hungarian authorities. At this peak time, many Austrians step up to the plate and donate in their thousands to help the new arrivals, with between 20,000 and 60,000 attending huge pro-refugee rallies in September and October.
Elections, elections
Although the ‘refugees welcome’ movement flourished in Austria in September, there were also many who did not feel as comfortable with the new arrivals. Fears over immigration lead to a surge in support for the far-right Freedom Party (FPÖ), who gain 15 percentage points in Upper Austria elections in September and then gain 31% of the vote in Vienna elections in October. Although not the only reason behind the growing support for the FPÖ, fears over migration numbers also contribute to the party coming ahead in the first presidential election in April 2016, before losing by just 0.6% in the run-off election in May.
Fences raised
After Hungary closed its border with Serbia and Croatia, the influx of refugees into Austria shifts from Nickelsdorf in Burgenland to Spielfeld in Styria towards the end of 2015. As thousands become trapped at Austria’s Slovenian border, Austria’s conservative Interior Minister Johanna Mikl-Leitner announces they will build a fence to help control the flow. The same day Austria’s leader - Social Democrat Werner Faymann - reiterates that fences “have no place” in Austria, a fight he is to lose. Divisions over whether to take a soft or hardline approach to the refugees begin to rise to the surface. By 2016 the fence in Slovenia is followed by a barrier at the Brenner border with Italy and preparations are made to raise a fence if necessary along the border with Hungary.
Closure of the so-called West Balkan route
After Hungary closes its border, other countries in the West Balkans begin taking similar action. Refugees arriving in Greece try to make their way to central Europe through Macedonia but are turned back. In March 2016 Macedonia, Croatia and Slovenia all announce that they have shut their borders, a move supported by Austria but met with concern from EU officials. After the closure of that route and the strengthening of controls at Austria’s Italian border, the pressure of managing new arrivals is taken off Austria as refugees and migrants seek new routes into central Europe.
Tightening of asylum laws
Around that time, Austria declares it took on almost 90,000 asylum applications in 2015 - one of the highest figures per population in Europe. The government decide they cannot let the same thing happen again this year and announce an upper limit on asylum applications of 37,500. Just days after the far-right take the lead in the presidential polls in April, the Austrian parliament adopt one of Europe’s toughest asylum laws. The hotly-disputed bill allows the government to declare a ""state of emergency"" if the migrant numbers suddenly rise and reject most asylum-seekers directly at the border, including from war-torn countries like Syria. It is a move heavily criticised by the UN and asylum experts, who say Austria is flouting international human rights law.
Change of guards
Spring also saw a significant change of guards in Austrian politics. Following the presidential election results in May - and growing discontent among his party - Austria’s social democratic leader Chancellor Werner Faymann steps down and is replaced by former railways boss Christian Kern who managed the transportation of refugees through Austria the previous year. Meanwhile, the police chief who managed the eastern Austrian refugee operations has become Defence Minister and the hardline Interior Minister swaps jobs with Lower Austria deputy governor, who quickly reveals he is just as tough on asylum seekers as his predecessor. Although the new Chancellor initially challenges the tough Interior Ministry on the ‘upper limit’ for asylum applications, months later Kern says he is ready to implement the controversial emergency measures by September.
Crisis dissipates in Austria
The number of asylum applications fell dramatically in Austria in 2016 compared to the previous year. The solidarity movement has also become less conspicuous. Politicians who helped to care for and manage the movement of refugees last year are now preparing to implement some of Europe’s toughest asylum measures. How might the country react today if another group of 71 refugees was found in the back of a van having suffocated? No doubt with sadness, but it would be unlikely to elicit the same powerful solidarity movement. At the other end of the scale, the earlier rise in anti-Muslim extremist protests this year has also somewhat calmed in the summer. Is there less fire in the belly of the anti-refugee movement now the crisis is less acute? The far-right’s presidential candidate Norbert Hofer is tipped to win the presidential election re-run in October but the question remains whether he'll be able to secure the same support without a refugee crisis to talk about."

					10:54 CET+01:00				",AFP,Austria will double the amount it pays refugees who volunteer to leave,"Austria said on Wednesday it would double the amount of money paid to migrants who voluntarily return home, as part of a campaign to speed up the repatriation of around 50,000 asylum seekers.
They would be offered $1,000 ($1,080) instead of 500 euros, Interior Minister Wolfgang Sobotka said.
The scheme, run in collaboration with pro-refugee groups, is primarily aimed at ""those who are not likely to be granted the right to long-term residence"", he told a press conference in Vienna.
Austria, a nation of 8.7 million people, has received more than 130,000 asylum applications since 2015 following the onset of the European Union's worst migration crisis since World War II.
Of the new arrivals, about 10,700 left Austria again last year, including 5,800 by choice, according to official data.
""The advantage of voluntary returns is that they are less traumatic,"" said Bernd Wachter of Caritas Austria, the Catholic Church's humanitarian organisation which works closely with refugees.
""They allow you to better organise the reintegration in the country of origin,"" he said.
However, the payment offer is currently only available to the first 1,000 people who register their interest and who have already filed an asylum application.
It is primarily aimed at nationals from Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan and sub-Saharan countries, but excludes people from neighbouring Balkan states.
The record number of arrivals in Austria -- one of the highest per capita in Europe -- fuelled anti-immigration sentiment and gave a boost to the far-right.
In response, the ruling centrist coalition announced plans in January to beef up surveillance and security measures, ban full-face veils in public and oblige migrants to sign an ""integration contract"".
The government has also capped asylum applications at 35,000 for 2017."

The tragic death came about when police moved through the train checking passengers’ identity documents, Bayerischer Rundfunk reports.
Officers found the young Egyptian hiding under a bench in an empty compartment. When they asked him to show his identity papers, he provided documents that he had been given in Austria.
While the one document recognized the teenager’s status as a refugee in Austria, the other ordered his deportation to Italy.
The officers ordered the young man to leave the compartment and wait in the corridor.
But according to eyewitnesses, he used the opportunity to escape into another compartment where he opened the window and jumped out.
The train was still travelling at a high speed through a town called Haar.
The young man landed on an adjacent set of tracks and was killed by the impact.
Police in Munich said the teenager had recently been caught by officers illegally entering Germany and had been sent back to Austria at the time.
It seems that once in Austria, he was ordered to leave the country and go to Italy.
Hundreds of thousands of people have entered Germany over the past six months seeking asylum.
Under the European Union’s so-called Dublin rules, refugees are supposed to apply for asylum in the country where they first entered the continent."

					13:21 CEST+02:00				", The Local,Four ways to help refugees in Austria,"The European Union is struggling to cope with a huge influx of refugees, many risking their lives to flee violence in Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan. If you want to help refugees arriving in Austria, here's how.
Austria had over 20,000 asylum applications in the first five months of 2015 alone - and officials expect the total to reach 80,000 this year.
Reception centres are packed, and some hostels for asylum seekers have been accused of inadequate care. The situation is pretty desperate. Many people feel powerless to help when they read the newspaper headlines, but here are four things you can do to help:
Volunteer
There are several charitable organisations in Austria dedicated to helping refugees. Volunteering at one of these is one of the best ways to make a difference, as you will have the chance to make personal contact with asylum seekers and help provide them with clothes, food and water. In return, you will get a new perspective, meet different kinds of people, and gain the eternal gratitude of those in need.
To sign up go to: https://freiwilligfuerwien.echonet.at/home/fluechtlingshilfe/54 or contact organisations such as Caritas, Diakonie, Volkshilfe and Don Bosco Flüchtlingswerk.
Provide accommodation
Instead of letting piles of junk accumulate in your spare room why not change a refugee's life by providing them with long-term accommodation. Finding accommodation is always one of the main challenges for a refugee, and providing them with a safe, secure roof over their head which is not in a mass accommodation centre will make a huge difference.
To sign up, fill out the form at: https://freiwilligfuerwien.echonet.at/home/wohnraum/54.
Alternatively, if you live in a flat share, the organisation Flüchtlinge Willkommen (Refugees Welcome) will match you up with a suitable refugee house mate, and assist with paying the rent. More information here: http://www.fluechtlinge-willkommen.at/
Donate your unwanted possessions
There are numerous organisations which will donate your unwanted possessions to refugees who will really appreciate them. Alternatively, you can donate new hygiene products to charities such as Caritas, who will create packages for refugees. They are currently seeking items such as razors, deodorant, shampoo, toothpaste, toothbrushes, sun cream, face cream, bandages and nappies. The retail firm ‘dm' is working with Diakonie and Caritas and has set up a new initiative across Austria to help provide refugees with these items. Customers can pay €5, €10 or €20 at the tills of any dm store and donate a ‘Welcome Package' of the same value to refugees.
Donate money
Donating €20 will buy a waterproof sleeping bag for a refugee. €21 will provide safe accommodation for the night. €50 will buy a mattress, and a further €45 will give a refugee a duvet and pillows. To donate to Caritas, follow this link: https://www.caritas-wien.at/spenden-helfen/aktuelle-spendenaufrufe/hilfe-fuer-fluechtlinge/.
The bank details of the organisation are listed under ‘3. Geldspenden'.

				11:35 CEST+02:00			 
					11:35 CEST+02:00				", The Local,Refugee job platform launches in Austria,"A job platform connecting refugees and asylum seekers to employers has launched in Austria.
Refugees Work was founded last November after a not-for-profit platform connecting NGOs to pro-bono work was contacted by a business wanting to hire refugees but not knowing how to go about it.
This week, the Refugees Work website opened for registration, with 140 companies and 1000 refugees already signed up in just the first few days.
“It’s going well so far,” one of the founders Dominik Beron told The Local Austria. “We’re seeing different industries with different motivations. Many accept there is a social responsibility to do this but there is also the recruiting motivation. Employers want to hire new people and they know that many refugees are trained and were even leading companies in their home countries.”
Last year around 90,000 asylum applications were registered in Austria and the topic has been a hotly debated issue, with the government erecting border fences and setting a cap of 35,700 asylum applications for 2015.
Public opinion on the issue is divided, although the charity Caritas say they are still seeing high numbers of volunteers in Vienna looking to donate their time to support refugees. Initiatives such as Refugees Welcome, where Austrians offer their spare rooms to refugees, and the refugee-run magdas Hotel, have also both been warmly received.
Refugees Work is the latest charitable project to launch in this area, helping businesses needing a highly-skilled and diverse workforce as well as asylum seeker and refugees looking for work.
Having tried and failed to find an NGO with the time and resources to take on the idea, Beron and his colleague Jacob Wagner decided to crowd-fund and do it themselves instead.
Difficulties finding work
The law in Austria states that people going through the asylum process are legally not allowed to be in paid employment. Those who do receive refugee status - which can take years, even decades - do have the same access to the labour market as everybody else, although the perception of some employers that it is complicated or sometimes unattractive to hire refugees can make it more difficult to get work.
Refugees Work aims to help both groups, by matching asylum seekers with volunteer opportunities and refugees with work suitable to their experience - but Beron emphasises there is also a strong business case as well.
“Employers can see there is a benefit of hiring people with different backgrounds,” says Beron. “For example a luxury hotel might want someone who can speak to Arabic to guests rather than German or English.”
Still in its soft launch stage, the website will continue to register companies and refugees in the next two weeks before the job platform opens and begins matching them.
“We wanted to give the refugees a chance to get help from NGOs to create good profiles, with information about themselves and good photos,” explains Beron. “This way, we also hope to make some matches on the first day.”

				11:58 CEST+02:00			 
					11:58 CEST+02:00				", The Local,Vienna's benefits system acts as a 'magnet for refugees',"Refugees in Austria are increasingly moving to Vienna because other Austrian states have reduced the amount of social security benefits asylum seekers can receive, which is designed to cover their basic living costs.
People granted asylum in Austria are typically awarded up to €914 a month to cover their basic living costs (Mindestsicherung) but many areas - including the states of Lower and Upper Austria have reduced this to €520.
Critics of the Vienna government - a coalition of Social Democrats and Greens - say it has vastly underestimated the cost of providing basic benefits to asylum seekers.
Figures show that the budget for social benefits has had to be increased to around €130m. The government of Vienna says that the number of recipients of social benefits has “risen sharply because of the inflow from other federal states”.
From 2011 to 2013 the number of benefits claimants who relocated to Vienna was around four percent. That figure doubled in 2015 and is now around eight percent (14,414 people).
The opposition ÖVP party claims that Vienna has a “budget crisis"" because of the increase in spending on social welfare and wants a special meeting of the city council to discuss record unemployment and debt levels and a refusal to reform the system.
Sonja Wehsely, the city councillor responsible for social affairs, says that only a small percentage of people are totally reliant on the Mindestsicherung, and that the number of “large refugee families” is few.
But she admitted that poor economic growth, a lack of employment opportunities and a rise in the number of people being granted asylum has led to increased costs, and that this has become political fodder for the ÖVP and right-wing Freedom Party (FPÖ).
She argues that if the Mindestsicherung benefit is cut then vulnerable people risk falling into homelessness, poverty and crime, and that the benefit exists to create social equality and peace in the city.
Reinhold Lopatka, political leader of the ÖVP parliamentary group recently said the social system is especially unfair in Vienna and that refugees who have been granted asylum status in Austria get more money from the authorities than farmers receive in pension benefits.
""A farmer who has been working hard his whole life has spoken with me. He now receives pension benefits of €620 and his son has to subsidise him so that he can feed himself. Currently migrants in Vienna receive €837.60, although they have never contributed to our benefits system""."

Austria has set a limit of 37,500 on the number of refugees it is willing to accept this year - as part of new government measures to ensure a tougher stance in Europe's refugee crisis.
The latest figures show that by the end of September, 75 percent of the total limit had been reached - with 34,657 asylum applications made.
Of those refugees who left Austria this year, most went voluntarily (4,515), and a further 3,311 were deported. Half of those deportations took place according to the EU’s so-called Dublin Regulation, which states that the first EU country in which an asylum seeker arrives is responsible for processing their asylum application.
Interior Minister Wolfgang Sobotka (ÖVP) has said controversial emergency measures planned for when the limit of 37,500 is reached will most likely only be in force for a few days this year, if at all.
A new law will allow the government to declare a ""state of emergency"" over the migrant crisis and reject most asylum-seekers, including from war-torn countries like Syria, directly at the border.

Figures from the Interior Ministry show that between January and November this year over 1,100 Kosovans left Austria voluntarily. Kosovo is considered to be a safe country of origin and migrants have little chance of obtaining asylum in Austria.
Migrants from Iraq and Afghanistan have a good chance of being registered as asylum seekers but so far 530 people from Iraq have returned home, and 120 from Afghanistan. ""This trend has become more noticeable since mid-September,"" Interior Ministry spokesman Karl-Heinz Grundböck said.
The Caritas charity confirmed that between September 1st and December 14th 257 Iraqis, 35 Afghans and 53 Iranians flew home - most of whom had been resident in Vienna. In 2014 only two Iraqis, nine Afghans and one Iranian chose to return to their own countries.
""Many are afraid of being deported and the humiliation of that,"" Caritas spokesman Martin Gantner said. He added that others are returning because they miss their families, and some had different expectations of what Austria and Europe would be like. “There are so many uncertainties for them here in Austria, many refugees are traumatized and need a sense of security,” he said.
Three Iraqi men in their 20s who spoke to the Kurier newspaper say they plan to fly home on Wednesday after three months in Austria. They are all computer engineers and had hoped to build a better life here. ""We wanted peace, freedom and a future,"" 23-year-old Muqdad said. He and his friends have been living in emergency refugee accommodation in Vienna's 3rd district.
""We've just been humiliated here,"" said Omer. ""It was a mistake to come. People look at us here as if we were terrorists, and all we want is peace. Dogs are treated better than refugees in Austria - at least they have something good to eat, and are even given something to wear.""
The Afghan and Iraqi embassies in Vienna have also confirmed that increasing numbers of their citizens are choosing to return to their countries and said that they are issuing travel documents to dozens of people every day. The flights are mainly financed by the Interior Ministry and the EU.
Günter Ecker, the head of Vienna's human rights association (VMÖ), expects the trend to continue. ""Many Iraqis say that they expected better social care here, and many also had a misleading idea of how long the asylum process might take. They didn't realise that they might have to wait a year or more until their families could join them here.”"

Left-wing Italian demonstrators are planning a day of action at Brenner, although they have not applied for official permission to protest either from the Italian or Austrian authorities.
One organiser - under the name Massimo - spoke about the planned action on an internet radio site.
He said: “We will hold the event on the Italian and Austrian side at the time same. If the democratic totalitarians want to erect fences, we will as enemies not accept the borders and make it impossible.”
Four hundred participants are expected to take part at the upcoming weekend demonstration. It will be the third such demonstration to take place at the Brenner border.
At previous protests, which had been registered with authorities prior to the event, several hundred demonstrators turned up and around the same number of police.
At the first protest estimates of between 500 and 800 people from Italy, Austria and Germany marched to the border in what began as a peaceful event but descended into violence between 50 participants and police. Five officers were injured in the clashes.
The second protest, which took place two weeks ago, saw hundreds of mostly Italian protesters push up against a line of Austrian riot police.
The demonstrators are angry about the measures being taken at the border checkpoint, including preparations for a 400-metre-long fence that Austria says it will erect if Italy does not cooperate with controlling the number of migrants and refugees crossing the border.
From the end of May, Austria will also introduce border checks in the area, similar to those already in place along the country’s southern and eastern borders.
South Tyrol police say they are taking the latest activity from the protesters seriously and authorities on both the Austrian and Italian side of the border are in contact with each other in relation to the event.
“This group are being observed and, following the announcement that reached us, there will be an appropriate police presence,” said South Tyrol’s provincial head Arno Kompatscher.
Police - who at the last protest deployed 300 officers - say they are preparing for a possible large operation on Saturday."

Sixteen percent were in favour of Freedom Party leader Heinz Christian Strache’s solutions to the crisis, which include constructing border fences anywhere where refugees and illegal migrants are trying to enter Austria. Chancellor Werner Faymann (SPÖ), who has rejected the idea of fences, only got a seven percent approval. 34 percent of respondents said they didn’t trust any of the politicians to come up with a good solution.
Strache has been vocal in his criticism of the government’s approach to the crisis - saying that Austria had become “almost a Banana republic”, with the government providing a “catering service” for passing illegal migrants.

“The trend is very clear”, the Interior Ministry spokesperson Karl-Heinz Grundböck told the Austrian Press Agency.
The figure follows a recent suspected arson attack on an unoccupied home for asylum seekers in Altenfelden in Upper Austria that had been due to open just a few days later.
Local residents, NGOs and politicians condemned the arson, with Foreign Minister Sebastian Kurz saying in a tweet that he was ""deeply affected"" by the incident.
Hundreds also turned up to a solidarity event at the site of the burned-out centre earlier this week to show their support for refugees in the the town.
Other incidents where refugee centres were targeted include an unknown culprit firing at an asylum accommodation centre in the city of Klagenfurt with an air rifle in January.
In early February, firecrackers were set off in front of a guest house in the district of Bregenz used to house 80 asylum seekers. No one was injured in the incident, although windows were smashed and the explosion could be felt in nearby buildings.
“This trend apparently continued into the first quarter,” said Grundböck, describing it as “no big surprise” given the divisive debate regarding migration and refugees in the country.
He added however: “There is no justification and zero tolerance for criminal actions.”

""I think we must mourn the things that weighed on us, and this play has the potential... to make us experience again something that shocked us,"" Wagner told AFP.
""It allows us in some way to detach ourselves from the problem, to observe it from a different point of view.""
The discovery of the truck in August 2015 on the A4 motorway coming in from Hungary, at the height of a massive influx of migrants into Europe, was indeed horrific.
When police opened up the poultry refrigerator lorry left on the hard shoulder of the busy road, they were confronted with an atrocious sight and an awful smell.
'A living documentary'
The stench of human decay emanated from the cargo container where bodies of migrants lay piled on top of each other, crammed into a small rectangular space.
Among them was a baby girl, not even a year old. Investigations would later reveal that the victims -- all from Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan -- had been dead for two days.
The men, women and children had suffocated shortly after smugglers had picked them up in Hungary, a key transit country on the so-called Balkan migrant trail during 2015.

Wagner's play features a truck-size screen playing black-and-white interviews from 15 people who experienced the tragedy including police, a young volunteer and the local mayor.
In the two-hour performance, this is interwoven with actors performing from 21 texts written by local authors as well as dancing and music composed by Ferry Janoska.
""We know the documentaries from TV... But here it is a living documentary! I found that awesome,"" actress Tania Golden told AFP.
""I have a great admiration for Peter Wagner, because he does theatre for the region, for people here, not for people who go to the theatre and who are used to intellectualising issues.""
The play premiered in a school in Parndorf on January 5 and then moved to the state capital Eisenstadt. Further performances are planned in nearby Oberwart and Grosswarasdorf."

Speakers denounced the terrible conditions in refugee camps in Greece, such as the Idomeni camp near the border with Macedonia, where some refugees died attempting to cross a swollen river.
There were also calls for human rights for asylum seekers, and an increase in the limits imposed on the numbers who could be accepted to arrive in Austria with refugee status.

Why do these refugees matter? Well, why would we even ask? First and foremost: they're people. Luck had it, that I was born in Austria. Maybe you were born in the UK. And they were born in Syria.
Sixty years ago, that would've meant, that it would have probably been me in Austria needing to escape. Nowadays it's people from war-torn Syria. But all that comes down to is pure luck.

And that also means: how could I not try to help? I've been sheltered all my life, I've grown up in a country in the middle of Europe. A country where you can literally cycle to the next capital city, forget your passport and realize - safely and without any disturbances or checks - that you are incredibly privileged.
When I see pictures from these borders now, it feels surreal beyond any measure.
So far, we've seen - at least in my generation - an unprecedented amount of generosity and also a hands-on mentality that I'm very positively surprised to see. Private people as well as organizations don't hesitate, they don't get caught up in asking the 'what ifs' but rather come together to provide the very basics to let refugees arrive in dignity.
I'm truly impressed by how well the general public has come together as one to help and I think those early September days haven't only ignited a spark of humanity but a bright flame that keeps on shining brightly.
The civil society has united to efficiently do what was necessary - at the borders, at the train stations, at the asylum centers. Meanwhile, the government seems almost frozen with - I can only guess - shock? Disbelief? A lack of compassion? - leaving people like you and me to muster up the courage and do a job that isn't ours but that is of such incredible importance not just now but for the generations to come.
What we, especially as a 100% voluntarily organized initiative, for sure struggle with, is the fact, that we don't run out of donations, but we are often finding it hard to bring together full-time jobs somewhere else with basically another full-time position working long shifts at the Viennese Hauptbahnhof without pushing our personal limits quite to the max.

The majority are families from Syria. They will be able to stay for four months in the former police training barracks in Erdbergstrasse. The second floor of the building houses a school, but the reaction from students and local residents has been mostly positive. “I think it’s a good thing, everyone deserves to live in a safe environment,” one student told the Heute newspaper. “My parents were refugees themselves, so I have sympathy - but you have to integrate,” he added. In the basement of the barracks there is a still a police training facility, complete with shooting range. The FPÖ has criticised the use of the building, saying it presents a security risk but the Interior Ministry has denied this. FPÖ leader Heinz-Christian Strache said on Sunday that he believes many refugees turn to criminality but was accused of scaremongering by Interior Minister Johanna Mikl-Leitner (ÖVP). There will be room for up to 350 refugees in Erdberg and a further 250 in a former University of Economics sports facility in the 9th district.
It’s not clear how long it will take to get the rooms ready in the university building, as currently there are not enough showers, and a separate entranceway needs to be built to separate the accommodation from an adjacent nursery. Some 150 refugees have been housed in police gyms in Eisenstadt, Salzburg, Linz and Villach. On Monday a gym will be opened for refugees in Graz. The Interior Ministry has urged the provinces to do more to accommodate the growing number of refugees, many of whom are fleeing Islamic State militants in Syria. Mikl-Leitner said that about 80 percent of Austrian municipalities have not found a single place for a refugee. Currently only Vienna and Lower Austria is meeting the agreed refugee quota. Traiskirchen, in Lower Austria, has currently reached its limit with 1,600 refugees - and needs to make space for more arrivals who will be applying for asylum seeker status."

Around 30 members of the Identitarian group interrupted the performance taking place at a University of Vienna lecture hall when they stormed the stage and threw out leaflets featuring the words ‘multi-culturism kills’.
The extremists then got into a brawl with some members of the 700 strong audience, in which around eight people were injured. The action lasted around seven minutes, after which the extremists left the venue and the performance continued on to the end of the show after the interruption.
It’s the second protest from the Identitarian group in recent weeks, after a group climbed on the roof of the Green party in Graz last week and unfolded a banner that read “Islamisation kills”.
They had originally planned to stage that protest at a local mosque, but chose the Green party HQ after police learned of their intentions and formed a security cordon with dogs and more than 100 police officers.
In the latest incident last night the extremists targeted a performance by refugees of the play Die Schutzbefohlenen written by Austrian Nobel Prize laureate Elfriede Jelinek in 2013.
Jelinek wrote the play in response to the occupation of Vienna’s Votivkirche by 60 asylum seekers to draw attention to their plight after Austria said they would be deported.
Most of them claimed that they their lives were under threat if deported to their native countries but Austria disagreed and deported many of them following summer.
The group performing the award-winning play last night included asylum seekers from Syria, Afghanistan and Iraq. One Syrian actor involved in the play's production has previously spoken about what it meant to him to be able to act and work alongside Austrians.
Speaking at a press conference on Friday, Austrian Culture Minister Josef Ostermayer said the ""shocking"" incident was the latest in a string of attacks by the group.
""The constitutionally guaranteed freedom of the arts and freedom of speech are as untouchable as the protection of minorities,"" he said."

""We can't take in all asylum seekers in Austria,"" Chancellor Werner Faymann said on Wednesday after a national asylum summit in Vienna.
The government plans to limit the total amount of claims to ""about 130,000"" over the next four years, on top of those filed in 2015.
""We have fixed this number as a guideline... We will study what happens when this limit is reached,"" Faymann noted.
The four-year cap, which represents 1.5 percent of Austria's 8.5 million population, was an ""emergency solution"" serving as a ""wake-up call for the EU"", the chancellor added.
State and federal leaders also discussed strengthening border controls, speeding up the deportations of failed asylum applicants and making it harder for family members to join those who settle in Austria.
The move is a further sign that the government is hardening its stance in Europe's worst refugee crisis since 1945.
Austria has become a key transit country for hundreds of thousands of migrants and refugees entering the EU - last year alone it processed 90,000 asylum seeker applications.
The influx has contributed to a surge in popularity of the far-right and sparked tensions within the ruling centrist coalition between Faymann's Social Democrats (SPÖ) and the conservative ÖVP party.
Until recently, Faymann had resisted the ÖVP's call for limiting asylum-seekers' numbers. But the coalition showed a united front on Wednesday, with both sides agreeing that a ""drastic reduction"" was needed.
The announcement comes in the same week as the launch of tougher border controls and the expected completion of a fence on Austria's main frontier crossing with Slovenia. The 3.7 kilometre barrier - set to be ready by Friday - will be the first of its kind inside the EU's passport-free Schengen zone.
Austria also signalled last week that it would follow neighbouring Germany's lead and begin turning back any new arrivals seeking to claim asylum in Scandinavia."

					11:29 CEST+02:00				", The Local,Austrian welfare group calls for refugee visas,"The director of Austrian welfare organisation Diakonie has called for 'humanitarian visas' to be used to help vulnerable refugees safely come to Austria.
The proposal from Diakonie's Michael Chalupka would involve embassies issuing a visa for humanitarian reasons, which would allow people to come to Austria where they can then seek asylum.
The idea follows the deaths of thousands of people – both refugees and economic migrants - who drowned while being smuggled across the Mediterranean Sea to Europe.
“In this way Austria could make it possible for the most vulnerable refugees to arrive to Europe without danger and not have to get into the dangerous boats,” Chalupka said, speaking Sunday morning on the ORF programme Pressestunde.
Chalupka, who is calling for support from Austria's Interior and Foreign Ministries, said that a humanitarian visa project could be “implemented quickly”. He added that Diakonie is already working on a pilot project with an Italian sister organisation to help open up a humanitarian corridor from North Africa to Europe.
The pilot project involves 'humanitarian correspondents' in North African countries recommending vulnerable refugees to embassies to receive visas. According to Chalupka, they programme could initially save 200 lives without needing to install additional camps in North Africa or have long-term processes to screen asylum seekers on African soil.
The announcement comes amid growing calls for a quota system that would distribute refugees more equitably around the European Union.
Austrian Chancellor Werner Faymann has said he supports introducing EU regulation that would allocate a refugee quota to each of the EU states and the idea is also backed by Germany, which fields about a third of the 626,000 asylum claims in Europe.
The suggestion of humanitarian visas was supported by Austria's Green party but received criticism from the Freedom Party who argued that if someone has to flee their country they can also go to neighbouring provinces or countries. “It does not have to be Europe or Austria,” said the party's Secretary Herbert Kickl."

Tusk called the troubled scheme ""ineffective"" and ""highly divisive"", in a letter to EU leaders before a summit in Brussels that entered its second day Friday.
Eastern European states like Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic, which have refused to take part, agree with Tusk but other including Germany and Greece do not.
""Tusk is right when he says that mandatory migrant quotas in the EU haven't worked,"" said Kurz, 31, who is expected to replace centre-left Chancellor Christian Kern next week.
""I will work towards changing this erroneous refugee policy,"" Kurz, currently foreign minister, told the Austria Press Agency, calling for a ""system change"".
He said it was ""positive that Tusk and other European states are pressing first and foremost for decent border protection and spending more EU funds on this"".
The quota scheme to share 160,000 migrants around the bloc, agreed by a majority of EU leaders in 2015, is to help frontline states Greece and Italy. So far only some 32,000 have been relocated.
The EU has since stalled on formulating plans for a permanent mechanism for future crises.
EU Migration Commissioner Dimitris Avramopoulos called Tusk's remarks ""unacceptable"" and ""anti-European"". They also drew stinging criticism from European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker.
Talks among EU leaders in Brussels that ran into the early hours of Friday failed to narrow the gap between eastern and western bloc members on the issue.
The stubborn divide contrasted however with broad agreement to continue shoring up Europe's external borders through cooperation deals with third countries like Turkey and Libya.
Kurz moved his party to the right to come first in elections in Austria in October. Local media expect him to unveil a coalition deal with the populist far-right on Saturday."

					08:35 CEST+02:00				",The Local/AFP,Germany eases rules as refugee crisis intensifies,"Germany said Tuesday it has eased asylum rules for Syrian refugees in a move expected to relieve pressure on southern European nations as thousands more migrants pour into the bloc seeking refuge.
Record numbers of people are streaming into EU member Hungary from Serbia, posing a new headache for regional leaders at a summit this week set to be dominated by Europe's worst migrant crisis since World War II.
As criticism mounts over the bloc's failure to find a response to tackle the crisis, Germany said it has stopped returning Syrian asylum-seekers to their first EU port of entry, becoming the first member state to effectively simplify the application process for those fleeing the war-torn nation.
""For the commission, this constitutes a recognition of the fact that we cannot leave the member states at the external borders alone in dealing with a large number of asylum seekers seeking refuge in Europe,"" said Natasha Bertaud, spokeswoman for the EU Commission.
Under the so-called Dublin rules, the first EU country that an asylum-seeker arrives in is required to process the claimant's application.
In practice, this means that countries on the EU's borders like Greece or Italy are overwhelmed with applications as thousands arrive by sea on their shores.
Hungary, another EU country with external borders, is rushing to build a vast razor-wire barrier to keep out migrants, fearing it will be overwhelmed by asylum requests.
The European Commission on Tuesday said it stood ready to provide Hungary with emergency EU facilities as Budapest struggles to cope with the record numbers arriving.
Almost 2,100 people, the highest ever daily total, crossed into Hungary on Monday near the town of Roszke, one of the few sections of the border not yet sealed off by the barrier.
They were among 7,000 refugees whose hazardous journey to the European Union was temporarily blocked last week when Macedonia declared a state of emergency and shut its borders for three days to halt the huge influx of people mostly fleeing war in Syria.
Authorities reopened the crossing after chaotic scenes involving police lobbing stun grenades at migrants trying to break through the border.
""We were stopped in Macedonia for two days, the riots were terrible, police used guns and tear gas, I saw an old woman beaten, her money and papers taken,"" said a 29-year-old IT engineer from Mosul in Iraq who said he had left his home to escape the Islamic State group. He asked not to be named.
'Europe's approach not working'
The UN's refugee agency said on Tuesday it expected the number of refugees moving through Macedonia to double to 3,000 a day, many of them women and children.
It warned that the situation was also worsening on the shores of Greece and Italy, where the number of Mediterranean sea crossings was now approaching 300,000 since the start of this year.
Since the beginning of the year, more than 2,370 people have drowned in the Mediterranean, already exceeding the death toll for the whole of 2014, according to the International Organization for Migration.
The UN called on Europe to ""establish a human-rights based, coherent and comprehensive migration policy"", as the bloc struggles to agree a response to the unprecedented numbers of refugees arriving.
""Let's not pretend that what the EU and its member states are doing is working,"" said the UN's special rapporteur on the human rights of migrants, Francois Crepeau. He called for ""opening up the regular labour markets through smart visas"" to be issued to migrants.
His comments came as Britain announced tough new measures against illegal migrant workers, with those caught working without permits in England and Wales facing up to six months in prison.
'Humanitarian disaster'
The migration crisis is set to dominate the summit in Vienna of leaders from the western Balkans region on Thursday that will also be attended by German Chancellor Angela Merkel, whose country expects to take in 800,000 migrants this year, a record number.
The western Balkans has now become one of the main routes into the EU.
More than 1,700 migrants were massed Tuesday in Serbia's Miratovac camp, waiting for an opportunity to cross into Hungary and onward to more prosperous EU countries like Germany or Sweden.
Austria, which lies on the route north, said Tuesday that more than 500 troops would be deployed to help overstretched authorities deal with the large number of migrants arriving from Hungary and Italy in recent weeks.
A key question that the summit would seek to address is why nationals of conflict-free Balkans states make up such a large number of migrants into the EU in the past year.
Nearly half of those arriving in Germany come from countries including Albania and Kosovo.
Some 102,000 migrants arrived in the EU via Macedonia, Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Albania, Montenegro or Kosovo between January and July this year, versus just 8,000 for the same period in 2014, according to EU border agency Frontex.
Summit host Austria will put forward a five-point plan at the conference including doing more to tackle people-trafficking gangs, a ""fairer"" distribution of refugees around the EU as well as aid to migrant origin countries.
""There is a pressing need for us to focus on the situation in the western Balkans,"" Austrian Foreign Minister Sebastian Kurz said earlier."

Average spending per asylum-seeker is set to rise to €10,724 next year, up from €9,593 in 2014, according to the latest available figures.
The total cost will represent 0.3 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) compared to 0.1 percent this year, Finance Minister Hans Jörg Schelling said in his annual budget report to the European Commission.
Despite the extra burden, Austria's public deficit would nevertheless stay well below the European Union's prescribed ceiling of 3.0 percent of GDP, Schelling added.
The largest chunk -- around €565 million -- will go toward basic care measures like housing, food and health insurance, as well as work and integration programmes.
A further €345 million has been earmarked for individual Austrian states as they face unprecedented costs of handling the refugee influx.
Austria has seen more than 200,000 migrants enter the country since the beginning of September, most of whom travel onwards to Germany or Scandinavia.
But this year's surge in asylum requests has made the Alpine country of 8.5 million people one of the highest recipients of migrants in Europe on a per-capita basis.
The continent's biggest migration crisis since World War II has reignited a long-standing EU debate about the bloc's budget rules.
Last month, Schelling made a plea for the European Commission to apply a special clause in the EU's Stability and Growth Pact allowing the deficit ceiling of 3.0 percent of output to be exceeded in exceptional circumstances.
But Germany -- which expects 800,000 refugees this year -- rejected the calls, saying the refugee crisis should be kept separate from the debate over national budgets."

Austrian authorities say that they believe he “was planning a serious offence in the period between Christmas and New Year in Salzburg"".
Police reportedly received a tip-off about the Moroccan in November. During the raid they had back-up from Cobra special forces, an anti-terror unit, sniffer dogs and explosives experts.
Nine refugees had been provided with accommodation at a former vicarage in Fuschl. Police said that detectives seized electronic data devices, more than €8,000 in cash, and a small amount of drugs. They did not find any explosives. In total, seven people were arrested, but police say the Moroccan is the main suspect thought to have been planning an attack and that the other men were arrested for drugs offences.
Police refused to say whether the Moroccan man is thought to have any links to the Islamic State terror group. The prosecutor's office in Salzburg, which ordered the arrests, also said it did not wish to comment on what is a continuing investigation.
The mayor of Fuschl, Franz Vogl, said that the vicarage is next to a kindergarten, but that parents and children who witnessed some of the police operation on Monday morning stayed calm. He said he was horrified to learn of the arrests and that the nine asylum seekers “had seemed well integrated and had helped out in the community”. He added that local retired teachers had been helping the men learn German and that they “seemed keen to integrate”.
The men are from Morocco, Afghanistan, Iraq and Iran and have been living in Fuschl for the past year. The Austrian Red Cross helped organise accommodation for them and has been supporting them. Salzburg’s Red Cross manager Sabine Kornberger-Scheuch said she was shocked by the arrests as “so far there had been no problems in the refugee quarter”.
The community of Fuschl lies between the city of Salzburg and Bad Ischl and has around 1,400 inhabitants."

That's because they are two of four specially trained horses cheering up, in picture-postcard scenery outside Innsbruck in Austria, a group of refugee children who have gone through some tough times.
According to Claudia Baldeo from charity Ankyra who started the project in 2009, the benefits of stroking, leading and riding the animals quickly become clear.
""It has a lot to do with sensitivity and feeling, being sensitive enough to receive signals from the horse. It is also good for learning concentration and tackling fears,"" she told AFP during a recent session.
""The parents notice as soon as they get home that the children are calmer, better able to concentrate. Even a year later they remember the names of the horses,"" the psychologist and psychiatrist said.
""Well done!"" she says as one boy, grinning from ear to ear, leads the mighty Lucky round the training area. ""Hossein says his grandfather has a donkey, and that a horse is just another donkey,"" she laughs.
Trauma
This summer's course, which combines time with the horses and art therapy, has 10 children, from Iraq, Afghanistan and Iran, aged nine to 11.
All arrived in Austria with their families in the past year during the great wave of migration from the Middle East into Europe.
Demand for the project is high but Ankyra has to limit numbers, and those most in need of therapy were chosen. Some then go on to receive extra therapy if needed.
What horrors Hossein, Mohammad, Reza, Ramin, Yousef, Banin, Zahra, Sarina, Marjam and Zinap may have experienced in their home countries or on the dangerous journey isn't always known.
But it is clear that some went through hell, and are suffering still. ""The whereabouts of the sister of that boy over there for example are not known,"" Baldeo says. Another girl in the group often sits in a corner at home and weeps. Her mother has attempted suicide.
""Parents tell us that they were in war zones and saw injured people, dead people, that family members disappeared,"" Baldeo says.
She says that children often pick up on the distress of their parents, who can be suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) having been imprisoned or tortured.
""They don't themselves have some way to recover. This was the aim of the project,"" Baldeo said.
Drop in the ocean
Equine-assisted therapy (EAT) has been widely used for years to help treat a range of disorders, but using it for refugee children is unique in Austria, and possibly elsewhere too.
But while these few kids in Austria may be getting help, it is just a drop in the ocean as Europe struggles to absorb the more than a million migrants who arrived last year, children and adults alike.
The German federal chamber of psychotherapists (BPtK) estimated last September that at least half of the new arrivals have poor mental health but that the care they receive is woefully insufficient.
""The refugees arriving don't just need accommodation and food but also medical care. But practically no mentally ill refugee is getting adequate care,"" said BPtK head Dietrich Munz.
The potential dangers of failing to take this seriously was plain to see in recent attacks in Europe where some of the perpetrators -- some of them refugees -- appear to have had psychological problems.
Such cases are extreme and of course it is by no means just migrants who have mental health problems.
And being traumatised doesn't necessarily lead to longer-term mental health problems, and many people recover without treatment, particularly if they can lead a normal life again.
""Sometimes having a job and having a home is more beneficial than living in a refugee centre for three years with a therapist who can only listen and say 'I hear you',"" Baldeo said.
""The questions they have is when can I work, how can I ensure a good education for my children... These are not therapeutic issues but integration issues."""

He said the influx of migrants should not be borne alone by the countries where they first arrive -- Italy and Malta -- but equally distributed across EU member states.
""The quota is a question of fairness,"" he told parliament, adding that asylum was ""not an act of mercy but a human right"".
He made the remarks after attending an EU emergency summit organised in the wake of a series of shipwrecks, which killed more than 1,200 people in April.
The tragedies have sparked strong debate among European nations on how to deal with the situation.
Last week, the European Parliament voted in favour of adopting an EU-wide quota.
The European Commission, the EU executive, is due on May 13 to present a migration policy that will include proposals to make legal economic immigration to the EU easier, and to set refugee quotas for all member states.

More than 28,000 requests were made in the country of 8.5 million inhabitants - three times the European average relative to population size."

The government has said that it expects 85,000 asylum requests this year. To date, there have been 63,000, with as many as 500 per day last week.
Between 20,000 and 25,000 people are expected to be granted asylum this year, and of these one in two is expected to apply to bring family members to Austria. Kurz has said he expects the number of positive asylum decisions to rise to around 40,000 next year.
Kurz has said that every recognised refugee will be given a personalized integration plan which will include access to German language courses, a five week course to determine a refugee’s skills and abilities with the aim of finding them work, and a compulsory eight hour “values” course which will discuss issues such as the rule of law, democratic values and equal rights for men and women.
The values course will also cover compulsory education, waste disposal and recycling, as well as rules regarding times when you shouldn’t disturb your neighbours with noise (between 10pm and 6am).
""These people arriving in our country are not bad people, but they have different values than us, and may not be familiar with our values. It is our job and our duty to familiarize them with our values,"" Kurz said.
According to government figures, 76 percent of current refugee applications are from men. 70 percent of refugees and migrants are aged between 16 and 46 years old - and 25 percent are younger than 16.
An initial 23,000 people are expected to be enrolled in the values course, which will be financed by a special integration fund.
The majority of people claiming asylum in Austria are from Syria, followed by Afghanistan and then Iraq."

					12:28 CEST+02:00				", The Local,'Italy must stop refugee flow or we’ll shut Brenner pass',"Austria has threatened to completely close the Brenner pass, one of the main links across the Alps, unless Italy stops the flow of refugees to its northern neighbour.
The country’s Defense Minister Hans Peter Doskozil said the “extreme” measure would be implemented if Italy fails to stop refugees crossing the border or doesn’t accept those who are sent back.
Speaking at a meeting of his SPÖ party in Innsbruck on Wednesday night, Doskozil said the Tyrol area of Austria has become a “refugee waiting room”.
Austria is adopting an increasingly hardline approach to the refugee crisis, deporting 2,800 failed asylum seekers since the start of the year.
Austrian police said construction work began on Tuesday on concrete foundations for a planned control area off the northbound motorway at the Brenner pass, which was an active transit point last summer for migrants making their way up from southern Italy.
Drastic solutions
Meanwhile, Austrian Interior Minister Johanna Mikl-Leitner said that while her government will do everything possible to avoid drastic solutions, “Italy must do more to process migrants”.
Austria, which received 90,000 asylum claims last year, has already stepped up controls along its borders with Slovenia and Hungary.
The planned fence at the Italian border came under attack by the EU after Italy's Foreign Minister Paolo Gentiloni and Interior Minister Angelino Alfano wrote a joint letter to EU Migration Commissioner Dimitris Avramopoulos demanding that he urgently raise the issue with Vienna.
European Commission spokeswoman Natasha Bertaud said on Tuesday that Avramopoulos would discuss the construction work with Mikl-Leitner.
Very concerned
""If these plans should materialize then we will have to look at them very seriously. The Brenner pass is essential for freedom of movement within the European Union,"" she told a press conference. ""The Commission is very concerned.""
The Italian ministers said the Austrian actions ""did not appear to be based on the facts"", adding that Mikl-Leitner had ""presented no data showing an alleged increase in the migrant flow from Italy"".
Austria, which has said it will implement additional control measures at its borders from June 1st, is also concerned that following the closure earlier this year of the Balkan trail from Greece towards Austria, a new route across the sea from Libya to Italy and then northwards will open up.
Church weighs in
The Catholic church has also lined up to oppose Austria's plans, with two senior officials criticising the decision to build barriers and other structures at the Brenner Pass, according to a report in Catholic Culture News.
Calling for “welcome for the one who knocks,” Patriarch Francesco Moraglia of Venice criticized the “manifest impotence” of Europe’s “ruling class” to develop a continental policy to address the “incessant flow” of migrants, according to La Repubblica.
Bishop Ivo Muser of Bolzano-Bressanone said that “border fences, nationalistic interests, the differentiation between us and the other, between natives and foreigners, stir up fears and build barriers in our heads and hearts.”"

The building will house four refugee families and will also function as a meeting place and according to the orchestra, ""a place for cultural dialogue"".

hundred tired migrants mill around a damp underpass at Vienna's main train
station waiting to continue their long journey to northern Europe.
Suddenly, a man wearing a red nose, tartan plus-fours and a brown leather aviator's cap enters, leading a noisy procession of three clowns -- all with a silly but also serious mission.
They are from ""Red Noses Emergency Smile Austria"", a project using 66 clowns to spread some cheer among the thousands of migrants still arriving Austria daily, particularly the children.
""You don't need to know the language, you just laugh and you feel a connection,"" Simone Mang, a spokeswoman for the organisers, told AFP.
""Children need to have a little time to themselves, and play and laugh and forget about the circumstances,"" she said.
At first there is a stunned silence as the clowns -- professional actors who underwent special training -- stomp in, playing an accordion and rattling tambourines.
But as the trio engage in a slapstick routine, the ice breaks. Laughter, clapping and cheering erupts as people gather round, carrying children on their shoulders and filming the scene on their phones.
Then there is a dancing session just for the children, who are given tambourines, ribbons and little pots of bubble-blowing solution.
Afterwards they are led away, giggling, to a special play room where they can draw, paint and interact with the clowns.
""They are happy, at least we find peace,"" said Hossam, a Palestinian, as he watched his four young children play, blowing bubbles and leaping onto a blue crash mat.
""I escaped from my country for them... For their future, to have good education, to have a good life, if God is willing.""
Beautiful eyes
""The (reaction) is amazing. So many eyes, so many beautiful eyes. Such beautiful colours, so clear and so direct,"" one of the clowns, Marie Miklau, 37, told AFP.
""But at the same time we had very sensitive moments to look behind the party to see the more silent people, the humans inside. You see also the journey they had, and also the suffering,"" she said.
The project came from Red Nose Clowndoctors, a charity sending clowns into Austrian hospitals to cheer up patients since 1994 and now active in 10 countries.
It is part of an immense voluntary effort that has sprung up since migrants began flooding into Austria in large numbers in September -- mostly on their way elsewhere -- and who keep coming every day.
""Train of Hope"", for example, a private initiative coordinating the volunteer effort, has 3,500 helpers who have put in a total of 300,000 man-hours in the past five weeks, its spokesman Benjamin Fritz told AFP on a tour.
""It began with a couple of tables and some bottles of water,"" the 26-year-old explains on a tour of tents and containers around the back of the station, a hive of activity. ""Now it's like a small town.""
Organised largely on social media, the initiative provides everything from hot food and medical help -- they even have an electrocardiogram machine with doctors on hand -- to clothing and hygiene articles.
There are also interpreters, psychologists and a missing persons point that posts pictures on Facebook and shares information with other organisations abroad.
Winter's coming
The project has been so successful that organisers have asked people to stop donating certain items such as crayons for kids, toilet paper, tampons and even wheelchairs.
They still need many things, however, like formula milk, cereal bars and razors. And with winter fast approaching, the Facebook page now calls for warm coats, thick socks, hats and gloves.
More and more of the new arrivals are becoming sick because of the weather. And at the same time, there has been a noticeable drop in donations and volunteer numbers, Fritz said.
""If it snowed tomorrow, then we would clearly have a problem. But we have had countless problems every day over the past five weeks and we solved them. We will manage somehow,"" he said.
""We will keep doing this until there are no more migrants here."""

					16:43 CET+01:00				", The Local,Austrian leaders rethink open door policy for refugees,"The refugee crisis will be the focus of a summit on Wednesday when Austrian state governors and leaders of the federal government meet in Vienna.
Foreign and integration minister Sebastian Kurz has said the crisis has overwhelmed both the EU and Austria and that plans to increase border controls will be high on the summit's agenda.
A spokesman for Chancellor Werner Faymann said that the aim now is to ""significantly reduce"" the total number of refugees entering Austria.
Kurz has said that countries like Austria will have to act in their own best interests because no consensus has been reached at the EU level, with many Eastern and Central European countries rejecting calls for refugee quotas. He added that frontline countries such as Greece have failed to secure the EU's external borders.
The Catholic Church in Austria has criticised moves to limit the number of refugees entering the country, with Cardinal Christoph Schönborn saying that ""we cannot solve all the problems, but we can help, and we can help more than we realise"". He appealed to Austrians to show more understanding for the plight of the refugees.
Last year Austria became a major transit country for hundreds of thousands of migrants and refugees entering the European Union, with most travelling onwards to reach Germany or Sweden. However, 90,000 people stayed and applied for asylum in Austria.
Speaking in Brussels, Kurz said that Austria cannot be expected to take in a similar amount in 2016 and called for a change in policy. ""I am firmly convinced that a policy of open doors and the belief that we could accommodate everyone in Europe was absolutely the wrong approach,"" he said, adding that many were now “rethinking” this.
Meanwhile, the president of the European Court of Justice Koen Lenaerts has said that imposing an upper limit on the number of refugees accepted by EU countries is not compatible with European law and a person's right to asylum under the Geneva Conventions."

Alex Hesling is originally from the UK but moved to Vienna when she was 17 and now manages the Four Bells Pub in Vienna’s 4th district. Her boyfriend David O’Connor, from Ireland, owns the O’Connor Old Oak pub in the 3rd district.
Last week they set up an Expat and Austrian aid for Refugees group on Facebook - originally with the aim of gathering clothes, food and toiletries for the thousands of people now kept in the overcrowded Traiskirchen refugee camp near Vienna.
Since the weekend she, David, and other volunteers have focussed their efforts on taking donations to Vienna’s Hauptbahnhof, where a self-organised team is doing a fantastic job caring for exhausted refugees arriving on trains from Nickelsdorf, on the Hungarian border.
“We had space in the pub to store donations and we realized that lots of our expat friends in Vienna and also around the world wanted to help the refugees arriving in Austria but weren’t sure how to and don’t speak German,” Alex told The Local.
After setting up the Facebook group and a wishlist on the Amazon website, packages have been arriving from America, Canada and Holland - and Vienna-based expats have been turning up with bags stuffed with donations. “We now have 200 boxes filled with sleeping bags, clothes and tents - people have been brilliant”, Alex said.
The storage room where donations are sorted.
The team at Hauptbahnhof have been telling Alex and David ""exactly what they need, and we’re only five minutes away,” Alex said. “We’re like an emergency response team! We’re open until midnight so have had many late night phone calls from people.
For example a youth centre has been opened in the 16th district, where all the unaccompanied minors from Traiskirchen - about 100 of them - have been taken as it was becoming dangerous for them to stay there. We got a call at 10pm that they needed bedding, sheets and pillows, which we delivered, and later that night we were sent a photo of them all in their new beds.”
She admits that she is exhausted as she and David have been organising donations on top of managing the pubs and are working 14 hour days, but “it’s been completely worth it”.
“We plan to take truckloads of donations to Traiskirchen in the coming weeks, to help families there build their new homes. We’re getting new people coming to volunteer with us every day - and I think we can keep the momentum going, definitely until the end of the year. We’re also supplying things for the convoys travelling to the Serbian border, where conditions are reportedly awful.”
Donations of money from international friends are “being funnelled to the people most in need - such as traumatised Syrian children living here, so that they have school supplies and counselling.”
She thinks that Austria’s “open arm policy has been amazing. Vienna is a city which was built on immigration. Most Austrians here are accepting of new people - and the incredible response from the volunteers at the train stations shows that they don’t want to wait for the government to do something, but will take things into their own hands.”
“A few weeks ago people in Austria weren’t that engaged but after spending one day at the train station, it really brings it home - these refugees are just like us, they were doctors or teachers, and they’ve been forced to leave their homes”.
She said she “wants to spread the message that this is nothing to be afraid of. Yes, it is change, but if we welcome people with open arms it will make the transition easier for all of us.”
At present donations of sleeping bags and tents are urgently need for the refugees who are having to sleep outside, as well as baby foods, non-perishable foods and hygiene products such as wet wipes and disinfectant gels. Follow the Train of Hope group for up-to-date requests from Hauptbahnhof.

UNHCR Syrian refugees Abdulrazaq and Raja feared for the worst last August when their son, Zaid, was born in exile in Jordan suffering from a serious heart condition. Jordan has been generous in accepting almost 600,000 of the 2.8 million refugees that have fled from the civil war in neighbouring Syria, but the massive influx has put a tremendous strain on basic services, including health care. Many refugees need hospitalisation, some for life-threatening conditions that Jordan struggles to treat. Abdulrazaq and Raja, who had fled to Jordan two years ago with their five-year-old daughter Ielaf, were desperate to get assistance for Zaid – the toddler needed open heart surgery. Their case came to the attention of UNHCR and the refugee agency identified the boy as extremely vulnerable and in need of help. UNHCR recommended the family for resettlement in Austria, which in August last year agreed to take in 500 Syrian refugees under a humanitarian admission programme. In April this year, the government announced that another 1,000 would be taken in. Austria has put a priority on offering resettlement to women and children in countries neighbouring Syria. ""This is a strong sign of solidarity towards the refugee community,"" stressed UNHCR's Christoph Pinter, adding that ""what is most important – it can be life-saving for the most vulnerable refugees."" Abdulrazaq, aged 30, said he and his wife were relieved and delighted when they heard they were going to be sent to a country where their son could be given life-saving assistance. ""We were so happy when we heard from UNHCR that we will be able to move to a country where . . . the operation could be performed right away,"" recalled Abdulrazaq. ""We did not mind at all which country it was; our only concern was to get the best medical care for Zaid.""
The family, including young Ielaf, who is still suffering from the trauma of their time in Syria, flew to the Austrian capital, Vienna, in February. On arrival at Vienna International Airport, little Zaid was transferred immediately to the city's General Hospital, where doctors performed open heart surgery. The operation was a success, but Zaid remained in hospital for a few weeks before being allowed to join his parents, who had taken turns looking over him in the ward. ""Everything went well,"" Raja smiled, holding Zaid firmly in her arms. ""We only have to go to the hospital for regular checks on Zaid's condition, and we have to keep him in an environment free of germs."" The family will soon move into an apartment near the hospital. As refugees, Zaid and his family are entitled to social support, including free medical care and access to education. The parents have the right to employment and Abdulrazaq, who worked as a carpenter and taxi driver in his native Homs, noted: ""We are determined to learn German and look for work."" For now, Raja's priority is to see her two children regain their health; she is thinking of trying to get counselling for Ielaf to help end the nightmares. ""She still hears the noises of the war and the bombs,"" Raja explained, adding that the girl was terrified by sudden noises like doors slamming. It reminds her of the time their home in Homs was hit by artillery fire. But despite the continuing concerns, Raja is grateful for their current situation. ""We are dreaming of a bright future for our children,"" she said. By Ruth Schoeffl Reprinted courtesy of UNHCR."

Born in 1942 in Linz, Upper Austria, Bock first worked as an educator in a special school. In 1969 she took up a position at a home for young people from disadvantaged backgrounds in Zohmanngasse, in Vienna's Favoriten district, eventually becoming the centre's director in 1976. During the early 1990s, Austria's youth welfare office began to send increasing numbers of foreign youths to Zohmanngasse, many of whom had been turned away from other centres. Bock realized these young people were in dire need of help and began to assist them with legal advice, housing and counseling. In 1999, the Zohmanngasse hostel was raided by police. Thirty young Africans were arrested for drug trafficking, along with Bock herself, who was accused of banditry and trafficking. The charges against her were eventually dropped, although she was subsequently banned from accommodating Africans at the hostel. Bock then began to organize and supervise the establishment of private residential communities, which she funded with her own money. Since retiring in 2000 she's devoted herself entirely to her refugee projects. Currently her accommodation centres house over 350 asylum seekers. Bock also provides counseling services, legal advice and a mailing address for a further 1000 refugees. These services are funded by donations and fundraising events – including concerts, festivals and even a campaign known as Bock auf Bier, in which the price of beer was increased and the extra revenue raised was passed on to Bock. Bock is the recipient of multiple awards, including the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) Refugee Award in 2000, the Bruno Kreisky Award in 2002 and the International Human Award in 2003. Last year, President Heinz Fischer presented Bock with the Golden Order of Merit of the Republic of Austria. She's also been the subject of two movies: the documentary, Bock for President (2009) and The Crazy World of Ute Bock (2010). In mid-December 2013, Bock suffered a stroke and was hospitalized. Since May however, she's been back at work on her latest housing project. For more information about how to help Ute Bock, see http://www.fraubock.at/home/"

The software was programmed last weekend, as part of a ‘Refugee Hack Vienna’ event which saw 25 volunteers get together to see what they could create. “It’s amazing what people who have never met each other before can make in a short space of time,” one of the organisers, Helene Pattermann said.
Smartphones have been an important lifeline for refugees in their long journey to other countries.
""This gives us completely new possibilities to help and to connect with people,"" Pattermann said. “We also wanted to help create an atmosphere of welcome - so that people can see that others are willing to help,” she added.
The Hack event, which was run as a friendly competition, saw an app called Where 2 Help selected as the winner. It’s designed to help coordinate people who wish to volunteer, as there are often too many or too few helpers at a particular location. “Lots of people said they have felt frustrated about this,” Pattermann said. Volunteers can now use the app to check what location needs their help the most.
Another app, called Refugees Connect, functions “like a walkie-talkie” and puts refugees directly in touch with aid workers. They can ask questions such as ""Where can I get a warm jacket?"", ""Who wants to go for a coffee?"" or ""What is the situation at the border?""
The Open Knowledge app is designed to make facts and figures about the refugee crisis widely available, and another app called Bridges enables users to chat in different languages.
“Now we have to see if refugees will actually use our apps,” Pattermann said.

The app due to be launched in June is designed to help asylum seekers navigate areas such as education or training, healthcare, work, administration, or what to do with free time.
It’s available in German, English, French, Farsi, Dari and Arabic, with the app creators hoping it will give new arrivals the confidence to get out into the city.
“The app should make it possible for anyone who is new to the city to navigate themselves and give them a bit more independence so that they can lead a self-determined life,” said initiator of the city map app Anna Müller-Funk, speaking to the Kurier.
“For those who have fled their homes it is difficult to always have to ask people for help”, said Müller-Funk, adding that the app will also help NGOs. “They always have to explain again where the next German course is or where there is a gynaecologist in Vienna who speaks Arabic.”

Rights groups, religious leaders and opposition parties have condemned the legislation -- the latest in a string of hardline measures against migrants -- as violating international human rights conventions.
UNHCR, the UN's refugee agency, warned that it ""removes a centrepiece of refugee protection"".
But Interior Minister Wolfgang Sobotka insisted Austria had no other choice as long as ""so many other European Union members fail to do their part"" to stop the influx.
""We cannot shoulder the whole world's burden,"" he said.
Wedged between Europe's two main refugee routes - the Balkans and Italy -- Austria received around 90,000 asylum requests in 2015, the second-highest in the bloc on a per capita basis.
More than a million people, primarily from Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan, landed in Europe last year, triggering the continent's worst migration crisis since the aftermath of World War II.
Many braved a short but dangerous sea journey from Turkey to Greece, before trekking up through the Balkans toward western and northern Europe.
To reduce the flow, the EU recently struck a controversial deal with Ankara, under which all ""irregular"" migrants reaching Greece after March 20 will be returned to Turkey.
Although the pact has led to a sharp drop in arrivals, the International Organisation for Migration last week warned that the numbers were ""once again ticking up"".
The crisis has boosted populist fringe parties across Europe, pressuring traditionally centrist governments to adopt a much firmer stance on migrants.
'Dangerous tools'
Under Austria's new law, the government can now declare an emergency if the migrant flow threatens the country's ""national security"".
Border authorities will then only grant access to refugees facing safety threats in a neighbouring transit country or whose relatives are already in Austria. Some groups including minors and pregnant women will however be exempt from the rule.
The ""special measures"" will also force migrants to request asylum directly at the border in yet-to-be-built registration centres, where they may be held for up to 120 hours while their application is being checked.
The restrictions are similar to tough rules introduced by the right-wing government in neighbouring Hungary last year.
In addition, MPs also voted to restrict existing asylum laws by placing limits on the length of asylum granted to migrants and making it harder for their families to join them.
""These are extremely dangerous tools that are being sharpened here, especially if they fall into the wrong hands,"" warned the leader of the small NEOS opposition party, Mathias Strolz, ahead of the vote.
Shortly before the vote, a group of protesters threw leaflets from the parliament's upper gallery reading ""Don't walk over dead bodies, it won't keep you afloat"".
It comes after the candidate of the far-right Freedom Party (FPÖ), Norbert Hofer, sent shock waves through the political establishment by winning the first round of a presidential ballot on Sunday.
The two candidates of the ruling centrist coalition failed to even make it into the runoff on May 22.
The FPÖ also looks set to do well in the next scheduled general election in 2018.
'Far from an invasion'
Trying to stem voter desertion to the far-right, Austria's government erected border fences and introduced an annual cap on asylum-seekers.
It also pressured other countries along the Balkan trail to close their frontiers earlier this year, effectively shutting the route to migrants.
The clampdown left some 54,000 migrants currently stranded in Greece.
It also pushed people smugglers to seek out new routes into Europe, including via Italy, which has so far this year seen 26,000 migrants land on its shores after setting off from Libya.
The surge in arrivals in neighbouring Italy has prompted Austria to announce plans to re-instate border controls -- including a 370-metre (1,200-feet) fence -- at the Brenner pass in the Alps, a key transport corridor between northern and southern Europe.
The move has sparked protests at the checkpoint in recent weeks and drawn strong condemnation from Italy.
""We're very far from an invasion,"" Foreign Affairs Minister Paolo Gentiloni told Austrian newspaper Die Presse on Wednesday."

Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Romania have rejected the idea of quotas - saying they would be futile if the EU's outer borders cannot be defended.
As refugees continue to arrive in Vienna after crossing the Hungarian border, city authorities have said that a total of 27,000 tonnes of donations, including food, clothes and children’s toys, were taken to Westbahnhof train station over the weekend.
540 volunteers coordinated by the Catholic aid charity Caritas helped sort and distribute them. 16,000 refugees poured into the station, and a further 4,000 arrived at Vienna’s other major train station Hauptbahnhof where a team of self-organised volunteers have set up beds for refugees to rest and are distributing food, clothes and first aid.
""What the volunteers and interpreters have done is stunning,"" said Peter Hacker, Vienna’s Refugee Coordinator. 1,500 refugees stayed overnight in Vienna on Saturday after they were unable to continue onto Germany, and were provided with beds by the Austrian Railways and the City of Vienna. The Stadthalle events centre, which hosted the Eurovision Song Contest in May, has also offered to set up beds if needed but so far that hasn’t been necessary.
According to the Interior Ministry, around 600 people claimed asylum in Austria over the weekend, more than had been expected. More than 18,000 people chose to travel onto Germany which has said it will accept asylum applications from Syrian refugees regardless of which EU country they first arrived in. Under the so-called Dublin rules refugees must claim asylum in the first EU country they arrive in.
Meanwhile, on Monday the European Commission announced that it would be providing Austria with €5 million, as an emergency fund to support looking after the influx of refugees.
Immigration and Interior Commissioner Dmitris Avramopolous said that the aid to Vienna is an emergency measure intended to bolster its capacity in view of the increasing flow of undocumented persons.
Convoy
A convoy of around 150 cars which set off for the Hungarian border on Sunday to pick up refugees and bring them back to Vienna went smoothly, and police said no one was arrested or charged. There had been fears the drivers of the cars could be prosecuted for people-smuggling under Hungarian or Austrian law.
On Tuesday, hundreds of migrants broke through police lines on Hungary's border with Serbia and started walking towards the capital, Budapest.
A crowd funding site has been set up to help refugees fleeing Syria and other countries get to their desired destination."

					12:37 CET+01:00				", The Local,Refugees being 'ripped off by private landlords',"The Vienna public prosecutor is investigating allegations that dozens of refugees have been ripped off by unscrupulous landlords in the city.
One man being investigated is the head of a company called Aldiar KG, which has its office in the Margareten district and has rented out apartments to numerous refugees.
Nina Bussek, spokeswoman for the prosecutor’s office, said that it appears that refugees ""who found themselves in a predicament and lacked inexperience or judgement” have been massively exploited.
When contacted by the Austria Press Agency (APA) the owner of Aldiar said that he hadn't been swindling his tenants, but that some of them had in fact not paid him any rent. He currently rents property to 80 people and claims that between 11 and 14 of them had failed to pay him rent.
When searching for accommodation on Vienna’s private housing market refugees face discrimination, high rents and poor quality housing, according to aid organizations.
The public prosecutor is looking into at least one other similar case where a real estate owner is suspected of ripping off refugees.
According to APA one suspect is a businessman from the Middle East who acts as an estate agent and has rented out apartments to families from Syria and Iraq. However, he has allegedly kept the rent money himself and some of the families have since been evicted by police from their homes, losing the deposit and commission they paid to the agent.
Aid organizations such as Diakonie and Caritas say they have been aware of the allegations for some time. The Vienna Social Fund (FSW), which subsidises rents for refugees, has also forwarded names of suspects to the police in cases where they fear that families are being exploited.
One Syrian refugee, who asked not to be named, said that refugees are sometimes warned that certain landlords or agents have a bad reputation but feel that they have no alternative. He said that he and his family were evicted from their apartment, despite having paid the rent, because the apartment’s owners never received the money from the agent.
Many property owners and agents refuse to rent to refugees as they require proof of income and employment before signing a rental contract.
The situation is likely to become critical over the winter. Currently, 9,000 asylum seekers have been provided with private accommodation in Vienna, according to Caritas expert Karin Knogl. However, she said that there are many more asylum seekers across the rest of Austria who plan to move to Vienna to be with family and friends once they have been granted refugee status."

					19:42 CET+01:00				",The Local/AFP,Erdogan threatens to unlock refugee floodgates,"President Recep Tayyip Erdogan threatened
Friday to open Turkey's borders to allow migrants to reach the EU, in a move
that would tear up a landmark deal that has reduced the flow.
Erdogan's comments, some of his toughest in recent times against the European Union, prompted an immediate warning from Germany which helped broker the deal that such ""threats"" were unhelpful.
The threat came a day after the European Parliament angered Ankara by backing a freeze in EU accession talks, already hit by alarm over its crackdown in the wake of the July 15 failed coup.
""Listen to me. If you go any further, then the frontiers will be opened, bear that in mind,"" Erdogan told the EU during a speech in Istanbul.
He said Brussels had cried out for help in 2015 as tens of thousands of migrants massed at Turkey's border crossing with EU member Bulgaria.
""You began to ask us 'what will we do if Turkey opens its borders'?"" he asked.
'Promises unfulfilled'
On March 18, Ankara and Brussels forged a deal for Turkey to halt the flow of migrants to Europe -- an accord that has largely been successful in reducing numbers crossing the Aegean Sea between Turkey and Greece.
According to the International Organization for Migration (IOM), just over 171,000 have crossed to Greece so far this year, much lower than the comparable figure for 2015 of almost 740,000.
Hundreds of migrants drowned while trying to cross the Aegean in 2015 on unseaworthy boats, including three-year-old Syrian Aylan Kurdi. The images of his lifeless body washed up on a Turkish beach spurred the international community into action.
Turkey agreed to step up maritime and land border controls in exchange for incentives on its long-stalled membership bid, including visa-free travel for its citizens and an acceleration of accession talks.
However with an October target passing, no apparent progress on the visa issue and the accession talks stalled, Ankara has accused Brussels of failing to keep its side of the bargain.
In response to Erdogan's remarks, Chancellor Angela Merkel's spokeswoman Ulrike Demmer said the deal was in the interest ""of all parties"" and that ""threats on either side are not helpful"".
EU Commission spokesman Margaritis Schinas said it would not get involved in ""statements about hypothetical scenarios"" and was still committed to implementing the agreement.
But the European Parliament's rapporteur on Turkey Kati Piri tweeted that ""linking (the) deal on migration with (the) EU accession talks was wrong from the beginning.""
Erdogan said while Turkey itself was looking after three million refugees -- mainly 2.7 million Syrians from the civil war, but also Iraqis -- but ""you (the EU) did not fulfil your promises"".
""You never acted honourably,"" he told the bloc.
He has also accused Brussels of failing to fulfil a promise to deliver some six billion euros ($6.3 billion) in aid for refugees.
The EU says the money is to be transferred gradually for individual projects and not in a single payment.
'Not a reality'
The European Parliament vote reflected spiralling tensions with Ankara after Brussels repeatedly expressed alarm over the magnitude of Turkey's crackdown after the coup. Turkey in turn accused Brussels of failing to show solidarity.
The parliamentary vote is non-binding and earlier this month, all EU foreign ministers -- with the exception of Austria -- said they were in favour of continuing the accession talks.
But analysts say the entire membership process is in deep trouble, with little hope of progress and several risk factors that could lead to its collapse.
""Realistically, moving forward is also nearly impossible... Both Brussels and Ankara remain stuck and are playing for time,"" Asli Aydintasbas of the European Council on Foreign Relations (ECFR) said in a research paper.
She suggested an alternative form of engagement between Turkey and the EU, other than full membership, could be agreed to save face and move forwards.
""In reality, most officials privately concede that full membership is not a possibility at this point,"" she said.
Austria's Foreign Minister Sebastian Kurz, a hardliner on Turkey, said Europe should strengthen its own borders after Erdogan's comments and ""must not give into blackmail"".

					19:19 CET+01:00				", The Local,"Integrate refugees with help, not pity","In the Austrian village of Gutau, inhabitants have set up a microcredit system to help refugees rent houses and start businesses.
A restaurant owner in Salzburg is training and employing refugees, urging others to follow suit. And inhabitants of Kaltenleutgeben have taken refugee families under their wings, giving them tours of the town’s museum and sharing meals. Locals believe newcomers integrate faster with practical assistance than with pity.
While their government has closed Austria’s borders, saying that the 90,000 asylum requests Vienna received in 2015 overwhelmed the country, Austrians in local communities have moved to the next stage: integration. And they are more upbeat than the politicians arguing every night on television over asylum and migration policies.
Austria’s Willkommenskultur, or welcoming culture, may have disappeared among the political class, but not among the people. Many volunteers say they cannot afford for integration—bringing people of different countries and cultures into society—to fail. They simply roll up their sleeves and try to make it work.
This is happening not only in Austria but all over Europe. While the media were focusing for the most part on EU summits, arson attacks on German refugee hostels, or disputes about Muslims sleeping in churches, Dutch mayors recently asked the government to stop talking about zero migration and instead fine-tune the practicalities of integration.
The mayors say the absorption of small groups of 100–200 newcomers works well in most communities, especially in the countryside, where buildings stand empty. Volunteers are active everywhere, organizing football tournaments and Dutch language classes. The city authorities in Amsterdam now help asylum seekers find jobs before they even have papers.
In Germany, musicians of the Freiburg Baroque Orchestra teach refugee children about classical music. And in Bavaria, whose Premier Horst Seehofer urges German Chancellor Angela Merkel to shut the country’s borders, towns and villages hand out refugee aid like clockwork.
Excel sheets show aid workers where volunteers are needed for night shifts or which communities need cars to drive refugees to the hospital. Individuals, NGOs, and churches work together.
For many, integration is not a choice but a duty. A retired pharmacist who does not like Merkel’s open-door policy toward the refugees wants to teach German. “Everyone helps,” she says. “Otherwise it will be a disaster.”
Most volunteers are doers, not dreamers. Their apolitical approach does not reflect the political gloom enveloping Europe. With extremist and populist parties on the rise in Europe, governments are afraid of a political backlash.
Countries like Austria, Germany, the Netherlands, and Sweden have welcomed people fleeing wars and repression before: Hungarians in 1956, Vietnamese in the 1970s, and refugees from the former Yugoslavia in the 1990s.
This time, public attitudes are more reserved. Already battered by economic and political crises, Europeans worry about terrorism and their ability to absorb many more Muslims into their societies.
So when the Dutch city of Arnhem received 400 refugees in September 2015, many feared a backlash in the neighborhood. But local inhabitants came to the former prison where the refugees were housed, offering cakes, toys, and help. It was moving, one Arnhemmer said. “Suddenly the refugees became Tariq from Homs and Yasmin from Aleppo.”
At a recent Viennese lunch with middle-aged, bourgeois women, it turned out several of them do refugee work. One of them is trying to get Syrian medical diplomas recognized in Austria. The women said that the initial bureaucratic chaos of summer 2015 had eased.
That chaos erupted because as in the Netherlands, the Austrian authorities distribute refugees throughout the country’s regions. Initially, the government in Vienna dispersed only groups of 1,000 asylum seekers or more, rejecting offers of smaller lodgings, claiming it was too much effort for too few people.
Most provincial governors had to be forced to accept asylum seekers. Some governors sent them straight on to villages with mayors from rival political parties. An imperial cadet school in the Austrian town of Traiskirchen, originally built for 500 people and 110 horses, had to put up almost 5,000 asylum seekers in summer 2015.
Traiskirchen’s mayor is a Socialist, the provincial governor a Conservative. The situation was a mess, which both parties used to score points. Asylum seekers slept in the streets, with municipal regulations preventing additional beds from being put up. Citizens brought clothing, food, and phone cards. Amnesty International called the situation scandalous.
Kilian Kleinschmidt, a German aid worker who until recently managed a refugee camp in Jordan for 80,000 Syrians, says the EU’s 500 million citizens should have no trouble absorbing 1.5 million newcomers. “Major airports manage millions a day. You just need the will to organize it.”
He also says things are improving on the local level. He hooks up investors, city planners, and Google executives with energetic Syrians who are clever with computers and have plenty of time. “[The investors] see the [refugees’] potential,” Kleinschmidt says, citing the success of networks such as Techfugees, which brings together tech engineers and NGOs, and workshops like Fab Lab that offer refugees access to digital technologies.
Pressure is mounting everywhere to allow asylum seekers to work. Alexander Van der Bellen, a candidate in Austria’s 2016 presidential election who is standing as an independent but is supported by the Greens, recently visited asylum seekers who had arrived months earlier but were still waiting for their first interview. He described the situation as unacceptable.
Friedrich Schneider, an expert on Europe’s shadow economy, is calling on governments to let asylum seekers and refugees work on the black market. “There is nothing worse than sitting on your bed the whole day, feeling useless and excluded,” he says. Austrian economists estimate expenditure on asylum seekers and refugees has already boosted the country’s economic growth. If the migrants start working on the black market, this growth will accelerate.
Letting refugees contribute to the informal economy could work wonders in Limburg, a Dutch province whose population is shrinking by 4,000 people a year. There, 1,200 houses are demolished each year. Limburg currently has 4,000 asylum seekers, but the provincial authorities are relaxed about the newcomers.
Schools, churches, and factories stand empty, so housing a few hundred people in local communities is relatively easy—if the central government permits it. Yet that is not always the case: recently, the Dutch government sent asylum seekers to The Hague but only allowed the city authorities to house them in an empty ministry if the city agreed to buy the building.
The arrival of refugee children has already prevented one Dutch village school from closing. Volunteers in Limburg are active and motivated in integrating refugees—even though some of them vote for Geert Wilders, an anti-immigration politician from the province. Nedcar, an independent Dutch car manufacturer, is eager to hire asylum seekers.
Extra hands are urgently needed in agriculture as well. Here, too, the message seems to be that bureaucratic inflexibility and boredom among asylum seekers are hindering integration more than an unwelcoming attitude among citizens. It is perhaps time politicians took notice.

""I say this very clear -- if we do not manage to control the situation... our only option will be to cooperate with Slovenia, Croatia, Serbia, Macedonia,"" Kurz said after an informal meeting of EU foreign ministers in Amsterdam.
More than a million migrants, mostly Syrians fleeing their war-torn country, landed in the 28-nation European Union last year, most of them crossing into Greece from Turkey, and then making their way through the Balkans to Germany and other northern member states.
The influx has exposed sharp differences and called into question the future of the Schengen passport-free zone as several countries -- among them Germany, Austria, Hungary, Sweden -- have re-introduced border controls.
Despite repeated efforts to halt the inflow, several thousand people a day still make the dangerous trip from Turkey to Greece and an upsurge in fighting in Syria threatens to make the problem even worse.
Foot the bill
Fanning the controversy, Austria media quoted Austrian Finance Minister Hans Jörg Schelling as demanding Brussels foot a bill Vienna estimates at 600 million euros ($670 million) for Austria taking in some 90,000 asylum seekers last year, saying his country could only afford to pay for 35,000.
The Kurier daily reproduced part of a letter to that effect which Schelling sent on January 25 to EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker.
The finance ministry was not immediately available for comment.
Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said separately that the EU was ""defenceless from the south.""
""If Greece is not ready or able to protect the Schengen zone ... then we need another defence line, which is obviously Macedonia and Bulgaria,"" Szijjarto said.
Hungary has taken the lead in calls for erecting a fence along Greece's northern border in the same way it built a razor-wire barrier along its own southern frontier last year.
Athens says it is doing its best but the numbers have overwhelmed the resources of a small country which is also struggling to get its economy back on track after a third debt bailout was agreed last year.
Earlier this week, the EU said Greece had to remedy a series of failings in order to re-establish full control over the border with Turkey and so preserve the Schengen area, prized as one of the bloc's greatest achievements.
If Greece failed to comply, then Brussels could allow other member states to extend border controls for up to two years, an option officials say they want to avoid at all costs."

Austria's failure to tell Bavaria when thousands of refugees are arriving or being brought to the border is causing problems, Horst Seehofer said.
""This behaviour by Austria burdens our neighbourly relationship. You can't and mustn't treat one another like this,"" he added.
Seehofer said that Merkel's top priority ought to be limiting what he said were uncontrolled flows of people from Austria into Germany across the Bavarian border.
""It's the Chancellor's job to speak with Austria,"" he said, adding that the two national governments had decided to introduce the much criticized 'open-borders' policy together.
""If I'm not successful [in getting an answer from Berlin] then we will have to consider what options for action we have,"" Seehofer told the Passauer Neue Presse – implicitly reiterating his threat to bring in undefined ""emergency defence"" measures if the federal government doesn't help.
Bavarian authorities complain that the lack of coordination is leaving them scrambling at the last minute to find resources to welcome the new arrivals.
Late on Monday for instance, around 2,000 refugees crossed on foot into Bavaria, catching local authorities unaware, police said.
Police spokesman Frank Koller said Austria had informed them that nine buses carrying asylum seekers were on their way to Bavaria on Tuesday, but from ""unofficial sources, we learnt that there are in actual fact 22 buses on the way"".
""The actual figures unfortunately sharply differ from Austria's reports,"" he said.
Austrian authorities rejected the claims as ""a joke"", saying both sides are in constant contact over coordination on the asylum seeker influx. They also criticised Germany’s introduction of a border crossing limit of 50 people per hour.
""Usually we don't comment on political statements but the fact is that if Austria receives 11,000 people in Spielfeld on a daily basis, Bavaria cannot say that it will just process up to 50 people an hour at its border. That's a joke,"" said police spokesman David Furtner.
""Plus this doesn't meet German standards: the government said that all refugees would be welcome. There seems to be a problem of interpretation by German national police who counteract the directive with restrictions (in migrant numbers),"" he added.
Hundreds of refugees have been forced to wait for hours outside in the cold without knowing when they will be able to continue onto Germany.
The Austrian Red Cross said it treated 6,500 refugees on Monday night and was able to house 3,000 in emergency shelters. ""The others continued onto Germany, and crossed the border,” Red Cross spokesman Christoph Patzalt said.
A report in the German newspaper Sueddeutsche Zeitung described the situation at the Achleiten border crossing in Austria as chaotic and said that whilst police are happy to escort refugees to the German border they are not providing them with “tents, blankets, or tea"".

“We are expecting up to 10,000 refugees to arrive every day,” Manfred Komericky, Styria’s deputy police superintendent said. He said he was not sure when people would start arriving in large numbers, but that it could be soon.
He added that the Slovenian and Croatian authorities were being helpful and giving authorities in Austria “timely information” about the flow of migrants.
With Hungary's border shut, more and more refugees are heading towards Croatia, which is not in the Schengen zone and has said it is ready to receive refugees and will also allow them to travel on to northern Europe if they wish.
Austrian, Croatian and Slovenian officials are holding talks on Thursday to discuss in detail the passage of refugees into Austria.
Emergency accommodation for up to 4,000 people has been set up near to Spielfeld and Graz. Soldiers have been deployed to help police carry out checks on the main road from Slovenia and on trains.
In Burgenland, police are carrying out checks on the A4 motorway at the border points of Nickelsdorf, Deutschkreuz and Schachendorf. Their aim is to catch people smugglers who have charged refugees to take them across the border, but police said no refugees would be sent back to Hungary. So far the disruption to traffic has reportedly been minimal.
Carinthia is also preparing for a wave of refugees crossing its border with Slovenia and has said that any refugees arriving on foot will be directed to one of 12 reception centres where they can receive assistance and information.
On Wednesday evening 540 refugees arrived at the main train station in Klagenfurt, on special trains from Nickelsdorf, on the Hungarian border.
The majority of refugees who arrive in Austria want to continue their journey on to Germany."

					17:15 CET+01:00				", The Local,Giving refugees dignity at a transit camp in Styria,"Angela Kamper volunteers with the Catholic charity Caritas and gave us an insight into life at a refugee transit camp in Styria, close to the Slovenian border - where refugees spend a few hours or sometimes weeks before continuing their journey or applying for asylum.
The camp, which can accommodate up to 3,000 people, has been closed during the construction of a border fence at Spielfeld, but is expected to reopen in the next few days, with thousands of refugees and migrants predicted to cross into Styria on a daily basis.
“People are traumatized and weak when they arrive,” Angela said. She described their empty eyes, and said that some refugees are aggressive and in pain. Some have open wounds or broken bones - especially broken arms. There are a lot of old people using crutches and wheelchairs.
New arrivals from Syria, Afghanistan and Iraq are greeted by between five and ten translators and up to 50 Red Cross and Caritas volunteers who give out blankets as well as toys for the children.
Sick and injured people, the elderly and children are the highest priority. Every refugee is allocated a cot to sleep in, and given hygiene products and clothes. The showers and toilets are in containers in front of the hall.
Food is provided twice a day. In the morning the refugees get three slices of toast, butter and jam. In the evening they can choose a hot meal such as a goulash soup or tuna pasta.
People living at the camp are allowed to move freely and can leave the camp as they please. But Angela says that one problem is that there is nothing for them to do. Some adults play football with the children, others go for walks, play cards and start work on learning German.
Another popular activity is something the refugees call “going shopping”. Many of them have not had any new clothes for weeks but at the transit camp they have access to clean clothes which have been donated. “When you give them clothes, you try to pick some in their favourite colours or in a style that would fit them. In return you get a big smile. It’s about small things like this,” Angela said, with a smile of her own.
But a feeling of misery, heartbreak and desperation remains. “These people have been through so much trouble to get to Europe, but they always make an effort to start a conversation - asking ‘How are you?’” Angela said. “And when you take your time to listen, they slowly start talking.”
One story which stands out for her is that of a young couple. One of them lost their mother on the journey to Austria. She was diabetic but they were not able to get the right medication for her - and she died before they could reach Austria.

Angela has has spoken to parents who lost their children, men whose families are still in Syria, and children and teenagers who are travelling on their own.
When Angela had only been working at the camp for a few weeks a young woman arrived with her newborn baby. The woman had given birth in Greece and she still had blood all over her clothes - she had not had a chance to change or to clean herself during her journey to Austria.
Angela was one of the first people the woman allowed to hold her newborn and said that they were immediately given medical care and are now both in good health. “You remember things like this. They stay in your mind forever,” she added.
Much of her time is spent with refugee children. “You notice how quickly they change,” she said. She describes how when they first arrive they are scared, and they draw frightening images in brown and black but as the volunteers gain their trust, the children slowly start drawing more colourful pictures of the sun, birds and flowers. Some children even paint the Austrian flag in red and white.
“Everyone is very thankful,” Angela said, adding that she admires how patient the refugees have been. At busy times, when bus loads of people arrive in Webling, they have to wait for hours before they are able to get back to their beds because the halls need to be tidied and sterilized, but Angela says there are no complaints.
“These refugees are searching for acceptance, respect, for a future but most of all, they are looking for peace,” Angela said. She hopes that they will be able to integrate into Austrian life, learn German and get to know our culture and traditions.
“No border fences can prevent more refugees from entering our countries. People are on the move and it has reached the point where they cannot be stopped anymore,” she believes. For her, it’s clear. “We have to be ready to give them a home.”
Despite the volunteers’ efforts there is an atmosphere of uncertainty in the transit camp. Questions like “When will we be able to continue our journey?” are heard on a daily basis. “It is tiring,” Angela says sadly. “Sometimes you just have no answers to their questions.”
“It’s not an easy task. You take the experiences home with you - and dream about what happened throughout the day. But, nevertheless it’s a beautiful job. I want to give people their dignity back - even if it’s just for a few hours.”

More than 4,280 people entered Austria from Slovenia on Monday.
""The inflow of migrants over the last three days has exceeded all manageable possibilities,"" a statement from the Slovenian government said, adding that parliament would be asked to approve legislation allowing soldiers to help in the crisis ""under very specific circumstances"".
Under current law, the army can only provide technical and logistical support.
However, ""this does not mean a state of emergency,"" Prime Minister Miro Cerar told journalists.
State radio said parliament would debate the emergency legislation on Tuesday and that it could enter into force within days.
More than 8,000 people streamed into the tiny EU member state from Croatia on Monday, with Ljubljana warning this largely exceeded its daily quota.
The nation of two million people has become a new key transit point on the migrant trail, after Hungary sealed its Croatian border with a razor-wire fence to migrants on Saturday just weeks after it had already shut its Serbian frontier.
Tens of thousands -- many fleeing violence in Syria, Africa and Afghanistan -- have been making their way from Turkey to the Balkans in recent months, hoping to reach Germany, Sweden and other EU states.
Slovenia criticised Zagreb for lifting border restrictions at Croatia's frontier with Serbia on Monday night, allowing the migrants who had been stranded in wet and muddy conditions for hours to trek to Slovenia.
Ljubljana called for greater European solidarity, warning it was ""delusional"" to expect small individual countries to handle the spiralling humanitarian crisis alone.
""Slovenia calls on the European Union states and institutions to engage actively in dealing with this disproportionate weight for our state... European solidarity is being challenged."" the government statement said.
""It is delusional to expect a country of two million to (accomplish) what much larger countries haven't been able to.""
Ljubljana has also accused neighbouring Austria of capping its intake of migrants and only allowing in 2,000 per day, a claim Vienna rejected. ""There are no restrictions in place,"" interior ministry spokesman Karl-Heinz Grundböck told AFP on Monday."

Spokesperson for Kern, Jürgen Schwarz, told reporters that the talks are expected to concentrate on securing the European Union’s external borders.
Austria has promised to send 20 police officers to Hungary’s border with Serbia, where around 30 asylum seekers a day are allowed to cross into a border ‘transit zone’ where they can apply for asylum.
Around 1,400 people are waiting on the Serbian side of the border to be allowed across the EU border, according to the UNHCR.
Last summer Hungary built a fence over 100 miles long at its border with Serbia in a bid to hold back the flow of asylum seekers and migrants - mainly from the Middle East - crossing its border.
This summer the numbers of asylum seekers trying to enter Europe via Hungary has dropped significantly following the 'closure' of the so-called West Balkan route.
Earlier this week police in Austria announced they had finished preparations for building a possible 100 kilometre fence along its eastern border with Hungary after securing permission from hundreds of private landowners in the region.
The fence is part of the country’s efforts to prepare for a possible repeat of last summer when thousands of asylum seekers and migrants arrived to Europe every day.
According to Hungarian media, around 30 and between 30 and 40 asylum seekers and migrants are estimated to cross the border into Austria every day.
At the meeting today - the first between the two heads of states - the leaders will also discuss the issue of returning asylum seekers from Austria to Hungary under the Dublin Regulation.
The regulation stipulates that asylum seekers can be sent back to the first EU country they enter. There are currently thousands of people who fall into this category in Austria and authorities hope to return them to Hungary.
Hungary has so far refused to accept returning asylum seekers, arguing that the first EU country they entered was Greece.
The return of asylum seekers to Greece was frozen last year, however, following a EU court ruling against it on human rights terms."

""Some of these so-called refugees will have grown up thinking anti-Semitism is normal,"" he said. ""It would be terrible if this were to happen in Austria.""
Austria has been a key country on the migrant trail and expects a record 95,000 applications for asylum this year and up to 130,000 in 2016, according to latest government figures.
Deutsch echoed comments made by the Central Council of Jews in Germany, which said it expected problems with integrating the mainly Muslim newcomers.
""Sooner or later we won't have a choice but to set an upper limit,"" the council's president Josef Schuster told Die Welt daily.
""Many of the refugees are fleeing the terror of the Islamic State and want to live in peace and freedom, but at the same time they come from cultures where hatred of Jews and intolerance are an integral part.
""Don't just think about the Jews, think about the equality between men and women, or dealing with homosexuals,"" he added.
German non-government group Pro Asyl criticised Schuster's comments, saying it was unfortunate the Jewish group was sharing the same position as the conservative Bavarian CSU party.
""It's disconcerting when the CSU and the Central Council of Jews are in fact demanding that we suspend the European Convention on Human Rights,"" said Pro Asyl's head Günter Burkhardt."

Michael Prüller, a spokesman for the Archdiocese of Vienna, told the Kurier newspaper that currently several hundred asylum seekers are being housed in church property, and that they should easily be able to provide housing for 1,000 people.
The Catholic aid organisation Caritas will help prioritise which families should be housed in church buildings, as soon as they are fit for habitation.
Prüller said that properties are currently being fitted with bathrooms and toilets, and should be ready by the end of September. “Dozens of parishes and monasteries have offered places in the last few days,” he added. The Archdiocese of Vienna includes 650 parishes, which extend into Lower Austria and covers a total area of 9,100 square km.
""Vacant rectories will be a rarity in the future. Before the current wave of refugees they were sold or rented. Now many are being prepared to house asylum seekers,"" Prüller said.
The canon of Vienna’s St. Stephen’s Cathedral, Toni Faber, has said ten asylum seekers can be accommodated in an empty building next to the cathedral. ""Probably two families. There have been discussions with the property management company and by the end of September two families should have somewhere to live - this is not about emergency quarters,"" Faber said.
The church will receive money from state housing funds to help pay for the renovation and accommodation costs. Together with services such as interpreters, medical care and educational support this comes to around €19 per day, per asylum seeker. Many church volunteers have also offered to help the refugees being housed in church property.
On Sunday Pope Francis implored Catholic institutions throughout Europe to show mercy to the refugees arriving in their countries by offering them shelter.

""We are considering that option too but at this moment... we are still looking for a European option,"" Prime Minister Miro Cerar told state TV late Thursday.
Slovenia has become the main entry point into the European Union's passport-free Schengen zone after Hungary sealed its southern borders with razor-wire fences to stop migrants desperately trying to reach northern Europe before winter sets in.
Ljubljana has asked Brussels for €140 million, in addition to police backup and logistical support.
""If on Sunday we do not get sufficient (grounds for hope), if we see there is no will for collaboration, then all possibilities will are available, seeing as we will have been left alone,"" Cerar said.
But he stressed that he saw the fence as a last resort. ""The border with Croatia is long and building a fence would be rather demanding. Police and army would have to guard it permanently to prevent illegal crossings,"" Cerar said.
More than 47,500 people have entered the small nation of two million people since October 17 when Budapest shut its frontier with Croatia, barely a month after also closing its Serbian border.
Most of the migrants, mainly fleeing violence in Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan, want to get to Germany, the EU's economic powerhouse.
Some 14,000 were waiting in Slovenian refugee camps and registration centres on Friday morning, hoping to continue to neighbouring Austria whose Spielfeld border camp was also bursting with new arrivals.
Austrian Foreign Minister Sebastian Kurz warned on Friday that the ""surge into Europe"" had become too big, adding that bloc members had a responsibility to protect their borders.
Border fences in Hungary and other EU countries had proven effective in tackling the crisis, Kurz said. ""The question is whether you want them or not,"" he told public broadcaster Ö1.
His comments echo those of Interior Minister Johanna Mikl-Leitner who on Thursday announced it was time for the EU to ""build fortress Europe"", after she had visited the Spielfeld checkpoint.
Some 7,000 refugees have crossed into Austria from Slovenia since Thursday, with some 4,500 still stranded at Spielfeld on Friday morning, police said."

Greece said on Thursday it was recalling its ambassador in Vienna for consultations, in an ongoing spat with Austria over the handling of Europe's migration crisis.
A foreign ministry statement said initiatives ""rooted in the 19th century"" were being used to address the crisis, referring to Austria's decision to call a western Balkans meeting this week without inviting Greek representatives.
It said the ambassador's recall was designed to ""safeguard friendly relations between the states and peoples of Greece and Austria"".
""Unilateral initiatives to resolve the refugee (crisis) and violations of international law and the European acquis by EU member states could undermine the foundations and the process of European unification,"" it said.
Athens is seething over a series of border restrictions along the migrant trail to northern and western Europe that has caused a bottleneck in Greece, notably leaving thousands refugees stranded on its soil after Macedonia denied all passage to Afghans and ramped up document controls for Syrians and Iraqis.

Three refugees from Afghanistan, including a pregnant woman and her teenage sister, drowned hours before the mass crossing while trying to navigate the river themselves.
Hundreds were also taken back to the border by the military border police after making the crossing.

The group was detained by authorities for 12 hours, had their cameras taken from them, and made to pay a fine of around 300 Euros before being released.

This is much higher than earlier official calculations, and is based on a projected 25,000 positive asylum applications per year.
The figure includes the costs of primary care for asylum seekers, integration, social security, and helping recognised asylum seekers access the labour market. The document estimates that if the cost of family reunification is included this would almost double the figure to €12.3 billion.

— Donald Tusk (@eucopresident) September 17, 2015
The ex-Polish premier consented to a demand made by Chancellor Angela Merkel after a meeting of EU interior ministers on Monday failed to reach an agreement on relocating 120,000 around EU member states.
On Tuesday Merkel called for a special summit saying ""it is a problem for the entire European Union and therefore we argued for a special EU summit to be held next week. Donald Tusk will look into that.""
At the meeting on Monday in Brussels ministers could only agree on quotas for a more modest relocation of 40,000 refugees from Italy and Greece which was proposed in May.
Germany had reacted to the failure furiously with vice-Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel saying Europe had disgraced itself, while Interior Minister Thomas de Maziere threatened financial punishment against the eastern European states who had blocked a resolution."

which burnt down a newly-built but still empty refugee centre in northern
Austria, police said on Wednesday.
Police are now offering a €5,000 reward for information that leads to the seizure of those responsible.
The huge fire broke out in the early hours of Wednesday in the village of Altenfelden and left only charred remains of the building.
No one was harmed in the blaze, which was battled by up to 200 firemen.
""We found two sources along the building's outer walls... where unknown suspects are thought to have started the fire,"" police said in a statement, adding that investigations were ongoing.
The alleged attack happened two weeks before 48 asylum-seekers were due to move in.
Austrian Interior Minister Wolfgang Sobotka condemned ""all forms of violence against refugee centres"" while Foreign Minister Sebastian Kurz said in a tweet that he was ""deeply affected"" by the blaze.
Sobotka added that an investigation was underway.
The Red Cross, which operates the centre, said it was ""shocked"".
""We will nevertheless carry out our duty to aid people looking for help and will seek out discussion with the regional authorities in the coming days to rebuild the centre as soon as possible,"" Red Cross president Walter Aichinger said.
The organisation estimates the damages to be around €300,000.
""We have no indications at all that people in the village were at all unhappy,"" Red Cross spokesman Stefan Neubauer told AFP.
Austria has so far been spared the string of arson attacks on refugee centres seen in neighbouring Germany, but many people are unhappy about the arrival last year of 90,000 asylum-seekers in Europe's biggest migrant influx in decades.
Last week, police commandos arrested a suspected neo-Nazi who told friends he wanted to ""kill all asylum-seekers"", recovering several weapons and ammunition at his home.
In May, a candidate from the far-right Freedom Party (FPÖ) came within a whisker of being elected to the largely ceremonial but coveted presidency, losing by just 31,026 votes to an ecologist independent.

""This means controls directly at the border some hours after the preparations today in the Austrian government"", she said ahead of a crisis meeting with her EU counterparts.
""We are in the process of informing the Commission about this,"" she added.
European Commission spokeswoman Natasha Bertaud said Brussels was ""aware of the reports"" of the Austrian decisions ""but we have not received the formal notification.""
""We are talking about the next days for these border controls. We will leave open at what crossing points we will do this primarily. In any case, we will start as soon as possible directly at the Austrian-Hungarian border.""
Austria had ""massive migration flows"" with around 18,000 refugees currently in the country, Mikl-Leitner said.
Germany announced on Sunday that it would reintroduce border controls to deal with the huge influx in migrants after throwing its doors open earlier this month.
Berlin's shock move, which struck at the heart of the EU's passport-free Schengen zone, has ramped up the pressure on interior ministers holding emergency talks in Brussels on Monday.
Germany has admitted that Europe's biggest migration crisis since World War II has pushed it to the limit and Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel said there were ""many signs that Germany this year will take in not 800,000 refugees, as forecast by the interior ministry, but one million.""
The United Nations refugee agency warned the confusion surrounding border policies around Europe could leave migrants, many of whom have made gruelling treks through the continent, in ""legal limbo"".

Last week Amnesty International said conditions at the camp are a ""disgraceful"" violation of human rights.
""We are continually informed about the situation in Traiskirchen, but it was important to me to be able to see the situation myself"", Faymann told media after the visit - which was held behind closed doors, with no reporters present.
He added that conditions at the camp are “unacceptable” and appealed to Austria’s states “to provide decent accommodation as soon as possible so that conditions like those at Traiskirchen are a thing of the past"".
On Tuesday Austria’s coalition government reached agreement on new powers for the federal government so that it can allocate asylum seekers to particular regions of the country, even if local councils are opposed.
""Every state that does not meet its quota, is responsible for that fact that refugees are sleeping on the street, in tents or in buses. The states must work closely with the federal government to get this situation under control,” Faymann said. He also called for a common EU policy on refugees and fair refugee quotas for all European countries.
President Fischer said that the visit to Traiskirchen had been his idea as he felt it was important for ministers to get a personal impression of what was going on. He said it was an “issue of human dignity” and that it was obvious that people living in the camp “don’t have it easy”.
He thanked “everyone in Austria who has been prepared to help refugees”. He said it was “high time” that the constitution was changed to allow the federal government to allocate refugees to local authorities throughout Austria, but said it was a shame the new law only comes into force on October 1st, and not before.
Many people from Vienna and surrounding areas have been driving to Traiskirchen to personally drop off donations of tents, food, clothing and sanitary supplies for refugees - although there has been some criticism that many such donations are going to waste as they are not what is needed.
The Traiskirchen centre is currently run by a private for-profit business on contract from the Interior Ministry.
The Greens' leader Eva Glawischnig recently called for professional and experienced charities to be put in charge of running Traiskirchen instead, arguing that conditions would then be better."

Border crossing closed
Meanwhile, the Austrian-Hungarian border crossing at Nickelsdorf on the A4 motorway has been temporarily closed, as Austrian police expect a large influx of refugees from Hungary and have said the situation could escalate to an emergency.
More than 16,000 people have crossed the border from Hungary since Saturday afternoon. Police spokesman Gerald Koller said that up to 10,000 refugees are expected to arrive in Heiligenkreuz in Burgenland on Monday, and that they do not have the resources to cope with such a large number.
Police have set up metal barriers to contain the refugees, who are arriving on buses every hour. Around 7,500 refugees are in Nickelsdorf, waiting to travel on to Vienna.
More than 5,000 refugees spent Sunday night in Vienna, police spokesman Patrick Maierhofer said. Around 1,100 refugees were reported to be at Westbahnhof station on Monday morning. During the last 24 hours 131 people have filed asylum applications in Vienna.
Röszke 'being closed'
There are unconfirmed reports that Hungary is about to close a refugee camp at Röszke, where up to 80,000 people are currently being held. The camp is 386 km from Austria and there are fears that the refugees will set off on foot for Austria.
People wishing to travel from Austria to Hungary on Monday are advised to use the border crossing on the A6 motorway, by way of Kittsee or Deutschkreutz.
Train services between Austria and Germany resumed on Monday morning, after being suspended for 12 hours on Sunday.
In recent weeks, tens of thousands of migrants have travelled up the western Balkans from Greece into Hungary and then Austria, all but a handful continuing to Germany -- which has relaxed asylum rules for Syrians -- and also Sweden."

The interior ministry announced the measures on Thursday in response to a surge of asylum seekers - over 600 asylum applications have been made this week alone, mainly from people displaced by the wars in Afghanistan and Syria.
Interior Minister Johanna Mikl-Leitner (ÖVP) said at an emergency summit held in the ministry on Friday that the tent shelters are necessary due to an ""explosive increase"" in the number of refugees and are a “last resort to protect against homelessness"".
The government says two tent shelters will be set up in Upper Austria, and one in Salzburg.
A deportation centre in Styria will also house refugees, and a refugee compound in Vienna's third district is being reactivated on Friday.
However, Catholic charity Caritas and the Red Cross have criticised the plan as cynical and insufficient and called for an alternative form of accommodation.
Caritas general-secretary in Vienna, Klaus Schwertner, said that proper shelters should be found to house the 300 refugees slated to move into tents.
He added that he believes the government may be trying to put pressure on the European Union with shock images of the migrants in the camps.
The Secretary General of the Red Cross, Werner Kerschbaum, said that Austria is one of the richest countries in the world and it shouldn’t be necessary that refugees have to live in tents. ""For us, this is the worst possible solution,"" he said.
Greens leader Eva Glawischnig said that Mikl-Leitner was exaggerating when she declared ""several hundred asylum seekers as a state of emergency"".
She said that if a small country like Lebanon could take in hundreds of thousands of refugees from neighbouring Syria then Austria should be able to cope.
She added that Mikl-Leitner had failed to plan for the predicted rise in refugees from Syria and called for vacant army barracks to be made available as accommodation.
Last year Germany also had to resort to using huge tents and shipping containers to shelter growing numbers of refugees.
Austria, a country of 8.5 million inhabitants, supports the EU's controversial migration plan launched earlier this week.
The proposal foresees the mandatory redistribution of asylum seekers across the 28-member bloc, to help ease the burden on southern nations where refugees first arrive by boat.
The scheme has been opposed by a number of countries, including Britain and Hungary.
Austria received more than 28,000 asylum requests in 2014, three times the European average relative to population size. This year, 14,200 demands were already made between January and April.

Two thousand people were granted subsidiary protection in 2013 - they did not qualify as refugees but it was acknowledged that they would face the risk of suffering serious harm if they were to return to their country of origin. Austria took in more refugees per head than the UK, France, and Germany, but less than Malta, Sweden, Norway and Switzerland. The largest number of asylum seekers in Austria came from Afghanistan (36 percent), then Syria (16 percent), and 14 percent from Russia (the republic of Chechnya). Last year, there were around 17,500 applications for asylum in Austria, according to Anny Knapp of Asylum Coordination Austria (ACA). ACA is critical of the treatment of Syrian asylum seekers in Austria. Knapp said in a press release that many, particularly those with serious health issues, ""are inadequately cared for when they arrive"". She added that those who were granted refugee status were often not helped to integrate, but were housed temporarily in remote areas, far from their relatives, and were not given enough help in seeking permanent accommodation.
Sweden took in almost 20 percent of the EU's asylum seekers in 2013, more than any other country in the European Union. The total number of Europe's asylum seekers shot up from 116,200 in 2012, to 135,700 in 2013. The statistics were published by Eurostat, the statistical office of the European Union, on Thursday."

They will discuss integration, housing and employment opportunities.
The flow of migrants continues, with as many as 4,000 people crossing the Hungarian border overnight and many having to sleep outside in Nickelsdorf. A section of the A4 road which crosses the border has been closed to traffic due to safety concerns, and a speed limit of 60km/h is being enforced along the motorway to prevent accidents as refugees continue to walk across the border.
Buses have been dispatched to Nickelsdorf to transport refugees to Vienna but a police spokesman there has said it is becoming difficult to maintain order.
Austria’s refugee coordinator Christian Konrad has called for housing solutions for the winter as hundreds of asylum seekers currently staying at the Traiskirchen reception centre in Lower Austria are sleeping in tents due to overcrowding there.
Education Minister Gabriele Heinisch-Hosek will be putting forward proposals on how to integrate refugee children into schools and Health Minister Sabine Oberhauser has said that she wants refugees who were medics in their home countries to begin working in hospitals as soon as possible - not least to help traumatised patients from their own countries.
EU Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker said in a “state of the union” address on Wednesday that asylum seekers should be allowed to work as soon as they are registered in their new country. Social Minister Rudolf Hundstorfer said on Thursday that he was open to this idea but that an easing of employment market regulations would only be possible if all EU countries agreed to accept binding quotas for refugee distribution.
Speaking to Ö1 radio he said that one proposal being discussed would give people who had been granted asylum in Austria a year-long ‘introduction’ to the labour market which would include training and working with aid organisations.
The head of Austria’s Public Employment Service (AMS), Johannes Kopf, said he would recommend handing out work permits dependent on a refugee’s country of origin - with refugees from countries like Syria, who are more likely to be granted asylum, being allowed to work immediately. He said asylum seekers from countries deemed ‘safe’ (such as Albania, Kosovo and Turkey) should not be given immediate access to the labour market."

The courses are designed to determine what skills asylum seekers have and are held in their mother tongues - mostly Russian, French, Arabic and Farsi. Whilst the courses for Russian and French speakers are mixed gender, the Arabic and Farsi courses have been split into one for men and one for women.
Kurz said that whilst the competency checks are “meaningful and positive” it is a “big mistake” and “absurd” to separate men and women from Middle Eastern countries. He added that the move goes against Austria’s fundamental values and sends the wrong message to refugees.
“If we let this happen, it becomes harder later on to explain why this isn’t part of the culture here,” he said. He added that equal rights for men and women is at the heart of Austrian society and should not be called into question, especially when Austria is trying to integrate refugees.
Separate courses for men and women is a result of “misconceived tolerance” he said, adding that if refugees do not respect Austrian laws their social benefits will be cut.
AMS head Petra Draxl defended the approach and said it was part of an ""innovative project"". She told ORF radio that from a woman’s perspective it was a sensible idea, as women from the Middle East region generally have completely different work experience than men, and that it makes sense to set specific priorities for women.
“The group dynamics don’t work well together, when you’re mixing mechanics and electricians with teachers and nurses,"" she said. She added that male groups would still be taught by female instructors.
She said the decision to hold separate courses was not prompted by the fact that men had said they did not want to attend a course with women, and that to her knowledge this had never happened before.
Around 20,000 job seekers who are recognised refugees were registered in Austria in October, about two-thirds of them in Vienna.
Social Minister Rudolf Hundstorfer said that he thought that at the beginning of the integration process it was acceptable to have single sex courses for refugees from the Middle East but that it “must be made very clear that life here is different.”"

Ten ‘New to Vienna’ classes, specially designed for refugees, are available in Vienna and there are plans to set up four more. The classes are taught in German and supported by teachers who speak the refugees’ mother-language.

Headmaster Werner Zimmer told ORF radio that the students are learning German very quickly and he hopes that some will soon be ready to switch to a regular class. The school will hold project days and sports events to help promote integration.

Education spokesperson for the Greens, Harald Walser, said that the classes made sense as a first step but must not become an “emergency measure” and that schools “must ensure they are preparing children for the fastest possible transfer into regular classes”.
Schools in Lower Austria introduced special classes for refugee children last autumn.
The Amstetten business academy has a “transition class” for 15 refugee children but school director Brigitte Bartmann said that such classes are not without challenges: “We don’t have suitable teaching materials and the student’s level of education varies widely. Some have only been to school for a year and others are close to Matura level. With the majority it’s not even possible to communicate in English.”

Military service was shortened from eight to six months in 2006. Doskozil did not say how long he thought military service should be extended by but said that if there was general agreement within the army “that it would make sense, then we will implement it”.
Last year the army’s Chief of Staff Othmar Commenda said an extension of military service would be a “worst case scenario”, and former defence minister Gerald Klug said that he did not think it was necessary.
Doskozil was appointed defence minister earlier this month. He was formerly Burgenland's police director and rose to prominence during the refugee crisis last year.

Twelve NGOs received a letter from the Interior Ministry in February asking them to declare donations made to their refugee work so the equivalent figure can be deducted from federal funding given to the charities.
In the letter, the Ministry asked: “What level of donations have been made to support refugee work since September 4th 2015 and how much has already been used for this purpose so far.”
They went on to explain that this information would be used to calculate how much will be deducted from the state funding.
A spokesperson for the Interior Ministry told Der Standard newspaper that they are following an objection made by the Finance Ministry about how they were following the guidelines for granting money to NGOs.
According to the head of the Austrian Red Cross Gerry Foitik however, the move will bring some organisations “to the brink of insolvency”.
As well as the Red Cross, other organisations that received the letter include Johanniter, Volkshilfe Wien, Train of Hope, and the Islamische Föderation.
A spokesperson for the fundraising association Fundraising Verband Austria Günther Lutschinger told the ORF that the NGOs had taken over the role of the authorities, who have failed to properly care for refugees, and this measure is “an attack on the idea of donations”.
“If the state begins to abuse the charitable organisations for their own purpose, then they will stop things like civil society or charitable activity,” he said.
The letter may not be a total shock for the charities, however, as a special funding scheme in place between NGOs and the state since last autumn stipulated that the costs eligible to be funded do not include donations.
Some legal experts have warned that there may be some problems over the legality of excluding donations from eligible funding.
The current agreement only runs until the end of March and negotiations between the government and NGOs on the new rules regarding funding are currently underway."

The mini summit, called by European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, groups the heads of ten EU nations, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel, plus the leaders of Albania, Serbia and Macedonia.
Bulgaria, Romania and Serbia on Saturday warned they would not accept being turned into a ""buffer zone"" for the tens of thousands of arrivals streaming into Europe.
""If Germany and Austria and other countries close their borders ... we will be ready to also close our borders at that very same moment,"" Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borisov said.
Over past months, non-EU member Serbia has been swamped by migrants on their way from Greece and Macedonia to northern Europe.
Serbian Prime Minister Aleksandar Vucic, who is due in Brussels, said: ""We will have difficult talks today, not pleasant for anybody, but I hope for a comprehensive solution.""
EU member Hungary has already built a razor-wire fence on its border with Serbia, which forced the flood of migrants to seek a route through Croatia, causing a massive build-up.
Budapest then promptly began putting up a fence along its border with Croatia, with the migrants re-routing through tiny Slovenia.
Make-or-break talks
In an interview with the Kronen Zeitung daily, Austrian Chancellor Werner Faymann said the summit would ""either consolidate the unity of Europe or watch the slow decomposition of the EU.""
Austrian Interior Minister Johanna Mikl-Leitner told the same daily that migrants were showing growing discontent and the police had to be ""ready to react"" against possible violence.
In an interview published on Sunday by the German newspaper Bild, Juncker urged countries to stop handing on migrants to neighbouring states in chaotic conditions.
Member states ""must take care to uphold orderly procedures and conditions,"" he said.
""The European Commission expects everyone to obey the rules of the game if we don't want to put Schengen at risk,"" Juncker said, referring to the EU's border-free zone.
The EU is facing record arrivals with more than 60,000 people in the last week entering Slovenia, which has a population of just two million, and 48,000 entering Greece, which has a population of 11 million, according to official figures.
Dangerous winter
With winter looming, Amnesty International on Saturday warned of a humanitarian disaster if migrants are stranded at borders.
Slovenia is seeking help after becoming the main entry point into the Schengen zone when Hungary sealed its southern borders.
Visiting a registration camp in the border town of Brezice, Slovenian President Borut Pahor Pahor urged his peers to take extraordinary measures to deal with the crisis or Slovenia would take unilateral action ""before it is too late.""
Slovenia has asked Brussels for 140 million euros ($155 million), in addition to police back-up and logistical support.
It says that if no help emerges, it may have to build its own border barrier with Croatia.
Human flow
An unprecedented 670,000 people mainly fleeing conflict in Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan have flooded into Europe so far this year in the biggest movement of its kind since World War II.
Most transit via Turkey, Greece and the western Balkans, seeking new lives in Germany and other northern EU states, creating a huge strain on those countries.
""The only goal of this long journey is to flee the disgusting war so we can start a safe life,"" Shaker Abara, 37, from the Syrian town of Homs, told AFP at the Berkasovo border area as he was waiting to cross from Serbia into Croatia in chilly temperatures early on Sunday.
Since last week's backlogs when thousands of refugees spent nights in the open air defying heavy rain and freezing temperatures, the situation has improved as the authorities of the two countries agreed to speed up the flow.
The 10 leaders from the 28-nation European Union who are invited to the mini summit are from Austria, Bulgaria, Croatia, Germany, Greece, Hungary, The Netherlands, Romania, Slovenia and Sweden.
The meeting takes place amid a clear split in the EU over how to best handle the crisis.
Some see the crisis mainly as a border security issue while others believe it is a humanitarian challenge requiring the bloc to show solidarity and redistribute refugees among them all.
The summit will concentrate on immediate operational problems of how to deal with the human tide, according to the draft statement seen by AFP."

Lawyer Walter Anzböck, who is in charge of liquidating Fritzl’s estate in Amstetten, told the Kronen Zeitung newspaper that the empty house could be converted into eight apartments and accommodate up to 60 asylum seekers. He said that the council could not afford to let the property sit empty, and that he planned to discuss the feasibility of such a plan with the Red Cross.
The cellar, where Fritzl kept his daughter locked up for 24 years and repeatedly raped her, has been filled in with concrete to ensure that no-one will ever be able to enter it again and to avoid it becoming a gruesome tourist attraction. Fritzl fathered seven children with his daughter, and was convicted of murdering one of them through neglect.
He is now 80 years old and is serving a life sentence in nearby Stein prison. His house has been up for sale for some time but the €200,000 property has not yet found a buyer. It has remained empty ever since his horrific crimes came to light.
The local council will make the final decision on whether to use the building for refugee accommodation. So far it has ordered a container which will provide beds for 150 asylum seekers - fulfilling its quota.
Mayor Ursula Puchebner told the Kurier newspaper that she had not been informed of the proposal, and nor had the asylum coordination office."

Both men, who had criminal records, had been hired by the Interior Ministry to work in the refugee home in Korneuburg, when they spotted an opportunity to make some money.
To add insult to injury, the 28-year-old and 43-year-old employees then paid a group of refugees to help them tear apart the kitchen and load it into the back of a van, unaware the men were stealing it.
Along with the kitchen, they also took laptops and projectors from the home, thefts which in total amounted to €60,000.

""The Duna he called it. He was right, it is beautiful.""

The rally was organised in Altenfelden in Upper Austria in response to the attack on the unoccupied refugee centre that had been due to open just a few days later.
No one was hurt in the incident although 48 asylum seekers who were due to be housed there were left with nowhere to go.
Organisers said as many as 1,000 turned up to the demonstration at the weekend, although police said the number was closer to 350.
Sozialistische Jugend (SJ), the biggest politically left youth organization in the Austria, organised the rally and used the motto: “We counter your hate with solidarity.”
The mayor of Altenfelden Klaus Gattringer joined the demonstration. Alongside him were several other politicians taking part to promote tolerance.
“In these containers there is not only rubble, but they also contain a lot of benevolence, altruism and initiative,” Gattringer said during the event whilst pointing at what was left of the refugee centre.
Plans are already underway to rebuild the asylum centre with construction due to finish in August.
The original fire broke out in the early hours of June 1st and left only charred remains of the building. It took 200 firemen to put the fire out and caused about €300,000 worth of damage. The fire occurred only a short period before the asylum seekers were due to move in.
The attack on the asylum centre came as a surprise as Austria has so far been spared the string of arson attacks on refugee centres seen in neighbouring Germany, but many people are unhappy about the arrival last year of 90,000 asylum-seekers in Europe's biggest migrant influx in decades.
In May, a candidate from the far-right Freedom Party (FPÖ) came within a whisker of being elected to the largely ceremonial but coveted presidency, losing by just 31,026 votes to an ecologist independent.

The plan was made public over the weekend, as various European countries attempt to curb immigration by adopting more restrictive policies, including Sweden‘s plan to expel up to 80,000 asylum seekers.
In January Austria’s government said that it would seek to cap the number of asylum seekers at 37,500 in 2016, compared to the 90,000 claims it received last year.
""We are already among the countries with the most expulsions,"" Austria‘s Interior Minister Johanna Mikl-Leitner told the Austria Press Agency (APA). ""But we will step up the pace and will increase the upward trend,"" she added.
The plan includes financial incentives for people to leave Austria, as well as an expanded list of safe countries whose citizens are unlikely to be granted refugee status.
In the future asylum applications for people from Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Georgia, Mongolia and Gambia will be decided within ten days. An asylum seeker who leaves the country voluntarily within three months will receive €500, and those who leave within six months will get €250.
Last year Austria deported 8,365 failed asylum seekers and under the new plan this number will increase to 12,500 a year.
Foreign Minister Sebastian Kurz said that the new deportation measures were “important, but even more important is to end our open door policy and not let so many refugees into the country in future”."

					13:07 CET+01:00				", The Local,Syrian and Iranian refugees 'well educated',"In a review of asylum seekers' qualifications, Austria’s Public Employment Service (AMS) has discovered that many refugees from Syria and Iran have better qualifications than out-of-work Austrians.
The AMS carried out competency checks on around 900 refugees between August and mid-December last year. The aim was to find out what qualifications they have and how highly trained they are for certain professions.
The results were presented on Tuesday by AMS boss Johannes Kopf and Social Affairs Minister Rudolf Hundstorfer. They show that Syrians and Iranians in particular tend to be university graduates, or have at least graduated from high school.
Afghan refugees tended to be the least qualified. On average, female asylum seekers are better educated than male asylum seekers - but again, it depends on their nationality.
Kopf said that he was particularly ""impressed"" by the level of education among Syrians and Iranians. Around 90 percent of Iranians who took part in the competency check had completed training and further education after leaving high school. Around 70 percent of Syrians had done the same. Around 40 percent of refugees from Iran and Iraq had university degrees.
The picture was more sobering for Afghan refugees - only a third of whom had completed compulsory education - and around one third had never attended school.
""Decades of war have left clear traces in Afghanistan. People's professional experiences are also lacking because of the country's underdeveloped economy and therefore are often not usable here in Austria,"" Kopf noted.
Kopf said the likelihood of finding a job in Austria increased with an asylum seeker’s level of education. “But we shouldn’t believe that integration will be easy,” he added. Many refugees speak very little German and don’t have the social networks in Austria which can help them find a job. A large proportion have also been through a traumatic experience.
Last year around 17,300 registered asylum seekers were looking for work. Minister Hundstorfer estimates that during 2016 this number will increase to around 30,000. He said that ensuring refugees were “rapidly integrated” into the labour market would prove to be a major challenge for Austria in the coming weeks and months.
He said that it was important that they should start contributing to the welfare system as soon as possible, and not be discouraged and forced to take illegal, unregistered work.
A debate has been raging in Austria over whether refugees should be given the same social benefits as unemployed Austrians.
Austria registered 90,000 asylum claims in 2015, a rise of more than 200 percent compared to 28,000 the year before and just 11,000 in 2010.
Afghans topped the list of requests by nationality with 25,202 asylum claims, closely followed by 25,064 fleeing the civil war in Syria and 13,258 Iraqis, data from the Interior Ministry showed."

The first rally that took place at the beginning of April saw around 800 pro-refugee demonstrators march to the Brenner border to protest Austria’s increasingly hardline approach to migrants and refugees.
The initially peaceful protest ended violently after around 50 participants clashed with police, leaving five officers injured.
Austria has introduced a run of measures in recent months to stem the number of refugees crossing its borders, including putting up fences and posting soldiers at its border stations.
Brenner has become a recent focal point of the Austrian government’s anti-migrant policy, which has seen it introduce a run of measures in recent months to stem the number of refugees crossing its borders.
As well as placing an upper limit of 37,500 asylum applications it is prepared to accept this year, the Interior Ministry have also being raising barriers at its borders, with building work starting this week on a 250-metre-long anti-migrant barrier over the Brenner motorway and main road.
The next demonstration at Brenner, organised by left-wing parties in northern Italy’s region of South Tyrol, is due to take place on April 24th.
In preparation, a delegation from the left-wing party Left Ecology Freedom visited the Brenner area on Thursday morning to meet with refugee activists and assess the situation, they announced in a press release on Wednesday.

Meanwhile Austria's defence minister has threatened to completely close the Brenner pass unless Italy stops the flow of refugees to its northern neighbour.
Defense Minister Hans Peter Doskozil said the “extreme” measure would be implemented if Italy fails to stop refugees crossing the border or doesn’t accept those who are sent back.
Speaking at a meeting of his SPÖ party in Innsbruck on Wednesday night, Doskozil said the Tyrol area of Austria has become a “refugee waiting room”."

If the applicant is found to have previously entered another European country where the so-called ""Dublin regulation"" is in force, they could be sent back there.
Interior Minister Herbert Kickl, from the far-right Freedom Party (FPÖ) said his aim was a ""restrictive and enforceable law regarding the rights of foreigners"" in order to end ""abuse"" of the asylum system.
The measures are due to be voted through by parliament in the next few weeks.
In last year's parliamentary election, a crackdown on immigration was one of the FPOe's key themes and was also adopted by Chancellor Sebastian Kurz and his centre-right Austrian People's Party (ÖVP).
Austria received more than 150,000 asylum applications -- almost 2 percent of its total population of 8.7 million -- following the migration crisis of 2015.
'Intrusion into privacy'
The measures announced on Wednesday also mean that refugees will only be able to apply for Austrian citizenship after ten years, as opposed to six previously.
Deportations of asylum applicants convicted of crimes will also be speeded up.
Human rights pressure group SOS Mitmensch denounced the measures.
""When the last bit of cash is taken away from men, woman and children, who already have very little, it's debilitating for those concerned,"" the group said, adding that the measures would make integration more difficult.
The seizure of mobile phone data would be a ""serious intrusion into people's privacy"", it said, while the plan to make applying for citizenship harder was ""political posturing"" to conceal the fact that the process is already very difficult.
Last week Kickl said he would push EU colleagues to end the possibility of asylum applications being made in Europe. He wants a system where people can only apply for asylum in so-called ""transit zones"", outside the EU's borders.
He previously caused controversy earlier this year by saying he wanted to ""concentrate"" asylum-seekers in certain places, employing a word widely associated with Nazi camps.

So far this year, more than 644,000 refugees and migrants have arrived in Europe by sea. Of these, just over a third – 34 per cent – are women and children who are particularly vulnerable to abuse as they transit Europe, UNHCR said.
""Refugee and migrant children moving in Europe are at heightened risk of violence and abuse, including sexual violence, especially in overcrowded reception sites, or in many locations where refugees and migrants gather, such as parks, train stations, bus stations and roadsides,"" UNHCR spokesperson Melissa Fleming told a news conference in Geneva.
""From testimony and reports we have received there have been instances of children engaging in survival sex to pay smugglers to continue their journey, either because they have run out money, or because they have been robbed,"" she added.
Fleming noted that unaccompanied children can be particularly vulnerable as they lack the protection and care of an adult. They may also be placed in detention in some countries, including with adults, posing great risks to them, she said.
Refugee and migrant women travelling on their own are also at heightened risk as they move through Europe, sometimes at night, along insecure routes or staying in places that lack basic security. Many reception centres are overcrowded, and lack adequate lighting and separated spaces for single women and families with children.
UNHCR is appealing to all concerned national authorities in Europe to take measures to ensure the protection of women and girls, including through providing adequate and safe reception facilities.
The refugee agency is also calling to all authorities, as a matter of urgency, to find alternatives to the detention of children. UNHCR and partners are working to prevent and address immediately family separations, as women and girls on their own face enhanced risks.
Together with partners, UNHCR are working with authorities to ensure access to information, to enhance the identification of persons with specific needs, including unaccompanied children, and their referral to appropriate services, to provide psychosocial support and to enhance reception areas, including through the provision of safe spaces."

In a press release ORS said that three meals a day were provided, with waiting times no longer than 15 minutes.
The three men preparing to go on hunger strike have been in Austria for a month but still do not know if they will receive asylum seeker status.
Moaweyah R. said that his family in Syria want to join him but can’t until he knows whether he can stay in Austria or claim asylum in another country."

					13:30 CET+01:00				", The Local,"The 6,165 irregular migrants who can’t be deported from Vienna","More than 20,000 asylum seekers are officially registered and receiving state benefits in the Austrian capital Vienna, but only two thirds of those are in the process of applying for or have been granted official refugee status, according to a report in the Kurier newspaper.
6,165 people are so-called ""tolerated stay"" migrants, whose removal is impossible either for practical reasons (such as a lack of documents or the country of origin’s refusal to accept them) or because their removal would contravene the Refugee Convention. According to the Kurier the Interior Ministry has confirmed this figure, but would not make an official comment on the situation.
Insiders told the newspaper that Vienna has a “magnet effect” on asylum seekers and irregular migrants - as the subsidies and social benefits given to refugees are more generous than in some other Austrian states. Asylum seekers may also be drawn to the capital because they have relatives or friends there, or expect a faster asylum procedure than in another federal state.
Of the around 6,000 persons who can’t be deported, 2,674 are actually rejected asylum seekers - mainly from Afghanistan, Syria and Iraq, but also from Somalia, Nigeria and Chechnya. These people do not have any identity documents or residency permits - either from their countries of origin or from Austria. They do have the option however of applying for a passport at their country’s embassy, and leaving Austria of their own accord.
“Every capital city has a ‘magnet effect'’’, refugee coordinator Peter Hacker told the Kurier newspaper. He said the important thing is to make sure that Vienna does not become home to “neglected ghettos of undocumented migrants”. He argues that it’s better that undocumented migrants should receive some form of social benefits which guarantee a basic standard of living, rather than have them slip through the net and wandering the city with no support - and possibly turning to crime.
He feels that Austria’s other federal states are partly to blame for the influx of undocumented migrants to Vienna, as they have cut the amount of social benefits they can receive.
As well as 2,674 failed asylum seekers, Vienna is also home to 3,491 asylum seekers who have been granted subsidiary protection, but do not qualify as refugees. They have been judged to face a real risk of suffering serious harm such as torture or the death penalty if they return to their country of origin, and so cannot be deported - even if they commit a crime in Austria. They have to apply each year for their residence permit to be extended on these grounds. They are also eligible to receive basic social security payments, and are allowed to work.
Around two-thirds of those who have been granted refugee status are men, and just over one third are women. Almost 25 percent of asylum seekers living in Austria are housed in Vienna."

					12:57 CEST+02:00				", The Local,'No respect' for human rights at Traiskirchen camp ,"Amnesty International has complained of inhumane conditions at Austria’s reception centre for asylum seekers in Traiskirchen, in a new report released on Friday.
Amnesty Austria General Secretary Heinz Patzelt said inspectors who visited the centre last week were particularly concerned about 1,700 under age refugees who appeared to have no-one to care for them.
He also criticised the fact that parents were not always housed in the same quarters as their children and that women had to shower in the same facilities as the men, with no curtains or privacy.
Patzelt said that he was ""extremely angry"" and appealed to political leaders to accept responsibility for asylum seekers, saying Austria had the resources to be able to care for refugees adequately but lacked the political
""The failure in the care of refugees could have easily been avoided, the blame lies primarily with administrative errors,"" he said at a press conference.
""Traiskirchen is a symptom of a far-reaching structural failure within Austria to dealing with asylum seekers,"" the Amnesty report said. It went on to criticise the severe overcrowding at the camp, inadequate medical and social care, and administrative hurdles which it said are easily avoidable.
The Amnesty team visited the camp for several hours and spoke to 30 asylum seekers. Last week 4,500 people were housed there, with hundreds sleeping in tents and some even forced to sleep in the open air outside the grounds of the centre - including pregnant women and women with newborn children. Traiskirchen was built to house 1,800 people.
Interior Minister Johanna Mikl-Leitner (ÖVP) has called for solidarity among the various European countries dealing with an influx of refugees from war torn countries, and acknowledged that it was ""clear to everyone"" that the situation at Traiskirchen ""is not sustainable"".
She has accused individual Austrian states of failing to provide extra housing for refugees.
The number of asylum requests in Austria rose above 28,300 between January and June alone - as many as the whole of 2014 - and officials expect the total to reach 80,000 this year.
Most arrive from neighbouring Hungary, which, like Austria, is a member of the EU and the passport-free Schengen zone.
Earlier this week the European Commission confirmed it was providing around €2.4 billion to EU members in migration aid, including €26.5 million for Austria."

					12:25 CEST+02:00				", The Local,Refugee crisis fears 'helped Freedom Party',"After state elections in Upper Austria resulted in huge gains for the right-wing Freedom Party (FPÖ) and major losses for the conservative People’s Party (ÖVP), regional governor Josef Pühringer has said he will be holding talks with all parties to discuss the options before forming a new coalition.
The ÖVP and the Greens have lost their majority, and an ÖVP/FPÖ or ÖVP/SPÖ coalition look most likely.
The Freedom Party is now the second largest party in Upper Austria and Pühringer (ÖVP) told Ö1 radio that he believed its success was solely down to the refugee crisis, and nothing to do with regional politics. “We can only take care of accommodation and on the spot care for refugees - but everything else is in the hands of international politics,” he said.
The FPÖ campaigned aggressively on the issue of immigration, and their success in Upper Austria may bode well for them in the Vienna elections which take place on October 11th.
The SPÖ gained only 18.4 percent of the vote in the weekend’s elections, a result which analysts are saying is ""catastrophic"" for the party."
